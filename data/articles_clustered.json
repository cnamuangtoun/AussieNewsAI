    "text": "Energy experts say South Korea's pledge to phase out thermal coal should be a wake-up call for Australia's fossil fuel industry.\ufeff\n\nThis week South Korea - a major customer of Australian thermal coal exports - joined Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), committing to abandon all its coal power by 2040.\n\nThe move was lauded by environment campaigners who have pushed major industrial nations to ditch fossil fuels and replace them with renewable energy sources.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia loses out in bid to host crucial climate conference\n\nSouth Korea is phasing out coal, and that has major implications for Australian mining companies. (AP)\n\nSouth Korea is the world's fourth largest importer of coal, which is used to power its industrial base and heat homes.\ufeff\n\nBut the country's steelmakers have been building steel plants that do not use coal, resulting in a gradual drop in demand for the fossil fuel.\ufeff\n\nBut South Korea's decision and similar moves by other nations also brings big implications for Australian coal exporters.\n\nThe value of Australian coal exports to South Korea is worth about $2.4 billion a year, data analytics company Kpler said.\n\nThe Australian Office of the Chief Economist has forecast a near 15 per cent decline in global thermal coal demand in the three years to 2027.\n\nThermal coal, along with iron ore, liquified gas and coking coal, make up Australia's four largest commodity exports from last year.\n\nClimate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley said those major exporters would be \"terminally challenged\" over coming decades as countries shifted to renewable energy to meet commitments under the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\n\"This should send a strong reminder to Australia as the second largest exporter of thermal coal behind only Indonesia that our key trade partners are responding to climate science and their treaty obligations,\" he said.\n\n\"Australia needs to pivot our export focus to low emissions industries of the future, in particular exporting green iron and aluminium, critical minerals and lithium hydroxide to help our key trade partners jointly deliver on their decarbonisation objectives.\"\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

(Dion Georgopoulos)\n\nThe key change was announced today by Victoria's Consumer Affairs Minister Nick Staikos\ufeff today after media reports of dishonest auction practices.\n\nUnder the current laws, agents can set a reserve or asking price which is above the previously advertised figure as late as the day of the auction\ufeff.\n\nIt leads to potential homebuyers wasting their Saturday at auctions for a home they an't afford.\n\nThe updated laws will require agents to publish the actual reserve price at least seven days before auction day.\n\nReal estate agents who fail to disclose a reserve price within this time frame will be banned from proceeding to auction or sale.\ufeff\n\nAll marketing materials will be required to reflect the honest reserve price too.\n\n\ufeff\"Underquoting isn't fair and it's young Victorians and families paying the price,\" Staikos said today.\n\n\"That's why we're stamping it out by requiring reserve prices to be published at least seven days before an auction.\n\nVictoria's Consumer Affairs Minister Nick Staikos. (Eddie Jim)\n\n\"We want the housing market to be fair \u2013 that's why we're continuing to crack down on underquoting with strong laws, a dedicated taskforce and active enforcement.\"\n\nThe Labor government said its underquoting taskforce has\ufeff issued over 200 infringements totalling over $2.3 million in fines.\n\nIn response, the Victorian Greens said it supported the fresh underquoting laws but warned it may not have any impact on housing affordability.\ufeff\n\nAll marketing materials will be required to reflect the honest reserve price too. (Getty)\n\nThe Greens claimed underquoting has \"run rampant\" in the state, which has fuelled competition and driven prices up.\n\n\"Labor's finally catching. First-home buyers have been getting completely screwed for years, wasting time and spending thousands on inspections for homes they were never going to afford,\" said Victorian Greens housing spokesperson Gabrielle de Vietri.\n\n\"Being told the reserve early is helpful, but it doesn't change the reality that most young people can't afford the reserve in the first place.\"\n\nSimilar laws were introduced this month in NSW , which penalises dodgy real estate agents who put misleading price estimates in property listings.\ufeff",

    "text": "A newly developed mRNA-based flu vaccine is almost 35 per cent more effective against the most common form of influenza , according to a new study.\n\nThe phase three trial, whose results were published this morning in the New England Journal of Medicine , involved more than 18,000 people aged between 18 and 64.\n\nHalf of the participants were given a standard flu vaccine, while the other half received the new mRNA option developed by Pfizer.\n\nA phase three trial of an mRNA flu vaccine developed by Pfizer shows it is more than 34 per cent more effective against influenza A than existing vaccines. (AP)\n\nThe study found that the latter was 34.5 per cent more effective at protecting people against influenza A.\n\n\"The mRNA vaccine performed better than conventional flu vaccines,\" Professor Archa Fox from the University of Western Australia, who wasn't involved in the study, said.\n\n\"Only 0.63 per cent of people injected with the mRNA flu vaccine came down with the flu, compared to 0.95 per cent of people injected with the conventional flu vaccine.\"\n\nThe results are similar to a trial of another mRNA flu vaccine developed by Moderna, which showed a 26.6 per cent effectiveness increase compared to a standard vaccine.\n\nHowever, there weren't enough cases of influenza B in today's study to determine the Pfizer vaccine's effectiveness against that type of virus, and the mRNA jab was also linked to a higher rate of mild to moderate side effects.\n\nInfluenza killed more than 1000 people in Australia last year and is on track to kill even more in 2025. (CDC)\n\n\"Lab tests suggested that the new vaccine may not be as effective against B strains,\" Associate Professor Seth Cheetham from the University of Queensland said.\n\n\"The mRNA vaccine was safe, but an elevated rate of side effects, such as headache and injection site pain, was detected compared to traditional vaccines.\"\n\nThe level of severe side effects, though, was similarly low for both vaccines.\n\nHowever, the phase three trial showed another limitation of the Pfizer vaccine: a lack of benefit for vulnerable elderly patients.\n\n\"Most crucially, it showed no significant benefit for adults over 65, the group most at risk from severe flu, highlighting that this is a promising step forward but not a complete solution for all,\" molecular virologist Vinod Balasubramaniam said.\n\nVaccination rates against flu have dropped significantly in recent years in Australia, despite a surge in the number of cases of the potentially deadly illness.\n\nExperts are hoping the development of mRNA vaccines, using similar technology to what was behind the successful COVID-19 vaccines, could lead to better protection against the virus.\n\n\"Manufacturing mRNA vaccines is significantly faster than traditional methods, which rely on growing the virus in eggs or cells, a process that can take six months or more,\" Dr Emma Grant from La Trobe University said.\n\n\"Faster production means vaccine strains can be selected closer to the flu season, reducing the risk of mismatch with circulating viruses.\n\n\"Moreover, as demonstrated with COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA technology can activate multiple arms of the immune system, including long-lived killer T cells that recognise multiple different influenza strains\u2026\n\n\"This capability moves us closer to the long-sought goal of a 'universal' influenza vaccine, one that provides broader and longer-lasting protection.\"",

    "text": "Of all the sacrifices athletes make in pursuit of their dreams, for Melbourne AFLW premiership player Blaithin Mackin, it's her mum's Sunday roast back in Ireland.\n\nThe 26-year-old Irishwoman spends four to five months in Australia playing with the Demons, and the other lion's share of the year back playing Gaelic for her county Armagh in the Ladies Gaelic Football Association (LGFA).\n\nAs one of six siblings \u2014 two who have kids \u2014 she says the hardest part of her playing career is missing important moments with them back home.\n\n\"I feel like it is hard. You're not fully settled anywhere, which sometimes I find tricky,\" Mackin told ABC Sport.\n\n\"I'm quite lucky that I have a good base at home \u2014 I still live with my parents \u2014 and then over here, I'm lucky with the girls and the friendships that I have. They're two good bases, but you are very much split.\"\n\nBlaithin Mackin of the Demons spends a third of the year in Australia and the rest in Ireland. (Getty: Dylan Burns/AFL Photos)\n\nMackin has lived with Demons teammates Alyssa Bannan, Megan Fitzsimon and Tyla Hanks previously. She now shares an apartment with her brother Connaire, who has joined her for the season.\n\n\"Which has been great,\" she said. \"Because it helps with homesickness.\"\n\nYet while many of her friends are putting down roots, she straddles living in two different countries to play both games.\n\n\"One of my best mates bought a house the other day and I was like, 'Whoa, I'm so far off', because I'm not at home full-time, I'm not here full-time,\" she said, noting that she wouldn't have it any other way as she doesn't want to give either sport up.\n\nBlaithin Mackin plays for Armagh with her sister Aimee. (Getty: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile)\n\nMackin is one of 40 Irish players in the AFLW, who make up almost 8 per cent of the entire competition.\n\nOn her own team is 35-year-old Sinead Goldrick, who Mackin said is surreal to play with, as she looked up to her as a kid in Gaelic.\n\nMany Irish players are attracted to the professionalism of the Australian game, whereas Gaelic is still amateur.\n\nThis means that Gaelic players have to fit training in around full-time work, often after hours, with little time for extras such as recovery, said Mackin.\n\nIrish influx is shaping the game in AFLW The AFLW has had an influx of Irish talent in recent years, with the new talent helping change the game.\n\nGWS' Eilish O'Dowd, for example, is a teacher back in Ireland and works each week day from nine to three or four before heading to training after dinner.\n\nThe appeal in Australia is being able to focus full-time on being a footballer and getting the most out of their bodies as athletes.\n\n\"You don't have this time for long either, where you're a footballer, so I just try to buy into that as much as I can,\" Mackin said.\n\n\"I love that side of it.

    "text": "Richard Rowles sees the Brisbane River as a living thing that \"breathes in and out two times a day\".\n\n\"It's got its own character and it changes all the time. When it gets angry, you don't want to be anywhere near it. But the rest of the time, it's pretty good,\" he says.\n\nThis perspective was shaped by a childhood spent launching off the jetty behind his family's riverside block in Sherwood, where his Irish ancestors established themselves after arriving in Australia 160 years ago.\n\n\"We grew up here as kids, so we spent a lot of time in canoes, swimming and fishing and shrimping in the river,\" he remembers.\n\nRichard (far left), pictured in the 1970s along the river playing with kids from the neighbourhood. (Supplied)\n\nRichard and his wife Janette passed this lifestyle onto their now-adult sons William and Ollie, whom they raised in the neighbouring suburb of Chelmer.\n\nStream Grand Designs Australia on ABC iview Architecture Professor Anthony Burke is back with a brand new series of Grand Designs Australia following some truly brave home builders taking on the challenge of a lifetime.\n\nAfter Richard's mother died in 2015, leaving the block to him and his brother to divide between them, the couple decided it was time to move back to the place he had first called home.\n\n\"Selling Chelmer was really difficult because it was our family home, we raised the kids there,\" Janette tells Grand Designs Australia.\n\n\"[But] we liked the connection with the fact we come from somewhere and we're returning to where we came from,\" Richard adds.\n\nThat's how the plan for a new build beside a river prone to catastrophic floods took shape.\n\nThere was the 1974 event that altered Brisbane forever; the deadly 2011 floods; and the 2022 deluge \u2014 and that's just in recent memory.\n\nThe original house on the Rowles family block (pictured) was inundated during the 2011 floods. (Supplied)\n\nIndeed, after the Brisbane River again rose to dangerous levels in 2022 and flooded Richard and Janette's Sherwood block once more, the builders who had just arrived on site were forced to stop work.\n\nThe couple were already used to what Janette describes as the \"torture\" that is \"watching the slow, insidious creep of water \u2026 over a few days\".\n\nDespite the 2022 floods, Richard says the couple decided there was \"no turning back\" after they sold their Chelmer home. (Supplied)\n\nBut no-one expected a 200-odd-metre stretch of the riverbank to subside in that flood, causing the land to drop down by up to a metre in areas on their block.\n\nArchitect James Russell says approvals for the project were suddenly retracted, forcing them to redesign the house.\n\nJames Russell says a number of houses near Richard and Janette's block were condemned after the 2022 landslip (pictured). (Supplied)\n\nBut, without that 2022 flood, the couple's riverfront home wouldn't be quite so resilient.\n\nA house you can hose out\n\nAlmost two-and-a-half years of work and upwards of $2 million later, Richard and Janette have ended up with a light-filled house set 11 metres back from the river and almost half a metre above council requirements.\n\n\"All the habitable floor levels are well and truly above what the Brisbane City Council sees as the 100-year-plus flood levels,\" Russell explains.\n\nThe mysterious front screen battens along the exterior of Janette and Richard's house offer only a hint of what life is like inside. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Tom Blessing)\n\nAnchored by 26 piers placed 13.5 metres into the earth, Russell's redesign kept possible future landslips front of mind. He says the house should \"have 10 to 20mm movement maximum if the entire bank [were to give] way\".\n\nIn case of a record-breaking flood, all valuables are on the upper level and the blockwork undercroft of the house is submersible, with elevated power points and light switches.\n\nIn the event of a huge flood, Russell says Richard and Janette might see water rise up to the landscaped courtyard in the centre of the house. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Tom Blessing)\n\n\"The materials are really robust, almost like rock coming out of the ground,\" Russell says.\n\n\"Some people might find it odd that the power points and switches are up two metres high, but this way the flood can go through and you can let it go down and everything can be hosed out.\"\n\nConnecting those spaces to the upper level is a concrete set of stairs that leads to an internal courtyard.\n\nThe upper level of Richard and Janette's house was also built with water-resistant materials. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Tom Blessing)\n\nUpstairs, 170 water-resistant and removable melamine panels have been screwed to the exposed epoxy-painted steel frame, and heavy-duty ironbark floorboards that could survive days submerged were used throughout the space.\n\nThe result is a house Richard and Janette feel safe living in \u2014 even without conventional flood insurance.\n\n\"If you want flood insurance cover in these areas, you'll pay a fortune \u2014 certainly $30,000 to $40,000 a year, which is a lot of money if you're going into retirement,\" Richard says.\n\n\"Our opinion is we spent a considerable amount of money on flood 'insurance' with the ground engineering and in-ground structure, with the materials used in construction, and the height we built at.\"\n\nAfter the couple explained what they had done with the build to their insurance broker, Richard says they were able to insure their home excluding flood cover.\n\nThe future of flood plain living\n\nJames Davidson, whose architecture firm helped inform Queensland's flood resilience framework, acknowledges Richard and Janette's house is \"on the big end of town\".\n\nBut with 15 years' experience helping clients improve flood resilience on budgets of $50,000 to $100,000 per home, he says the same principles can be used for any property, \"no matter the cost\".\n\nArchitect James Davidson says flood-resilient design elements like those used in the Sherwood home buy their residents \"some time\". (ABC/Fremantle Media: Tom Blessing)\n\n\"And the cost-benefit is significant. If you put $50,000 into [flood resilience] now, it'll save incredible amounts of money over time.\"\n\nBuilding and retrofitting for flood resilience: Understand projected flood levels\n\nUse resilient materials up high\n\nMove services and switches up\n\nChoose non-cavity construction\n\nDitch plasterboard\n\nUse concrete, tiled and rendered surfaces\n\nRaise houses where possible\n\nTreat pine framing\n\nWhether building a new home or retrofitting, he says the most critical thing to understand is your current and projected flood levels.\n\n\"Council adjusts those levels with every new event,\" he explains.\n\n\" Understand that if you do build to the [current] council flood level, it might go higher next time and you might still be at risk. \"\n\nPeople often think making a property more flood-resilient is costly, but Davidson says the materials are affordable and readily available. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Tom Blessing)\n\nHe also recommends using resilient materials above those defined floodlines, as Janette and Richard did, and getting services like air conditioning and hot water units as high as possible.\n\nThe same goes for switches and powerpoints, so long as this is accessible.\n\nAnd where possible, Davidson suggests avoiding cavity construction.\n\n\"Cavities cause mould growth and humidity problems,\" he explains. \"Concrete slabs, tiled and rendered surfaces are good. And when it comes to cabinetry, there are flood-resilient materials.\"\n\nRichard and Janette's hose-out undercroft (pictured), atop which sits an elegant cantilevered steel structure that houses their living spaces. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Tom Blessing)\n\nWhen retrofitting, Davidson recommends raising houses wherever possible, using tiles, concrete slabs or hardwood for flooring, ditching plasterboard in the walls and treating any pine framing with mould-resistant paint.\n\nRetrofitting a home for natural disasters Rebuilding a home exactly as it was doesn't always make sense for those impacted by natural disasters.\n\nBut he sees none of these measures as \"solutions\" \u2014 in Davidson's mind, that would be retreating from the worst-hit areas.\n\n\"These things will buy some time \u2026 I'm not totally convinced that we should be building right onto the Brisbane River in the future.\n\n\"And I don't want my work to be seen as the 'get-out-of-jail-free card' where people say, 'Oh, we'll be fine, we've done it resiliently.'\"\n\nThere's no such thing, Davidson argues, as a flood-proof house.\n\n\"But there are resilient homes and homeowners who are happy to stay in [higher-risk] locations.\"\n\nWatch the new season of Grand Designs Australia free on ABC TV and ABC iview.",

It is about protecting and preserving our homelands, our cultures, and our future with dignity and humility.\"\n\nBut some climate experts were more optimistic about the compromise.\n\nErwin Jackson from Monash University's Climateworks Centre said the outcome would ensure \"Australia and the Pacific will remain central to global climate transition.\"\n\n\"The region has everything to gain by building global momentum towards clean energy,\" he said.\n\n\"Australia's leadership role as the president holding the pen on text negotiation outcomes and leaders meeting in the Pacific will be highly influential in the outcomes of COP31.\n\n\"Strong regional leadership will be critical to accelerating the shift to a low-emissions future across Australia, the Pacific and the world.\"\n\nMr Bowen said both countries had to reach an agreement in order to avoid \"12 months with a lack of leadership, no COP president in place, no plan\".\n\n\"I know some people [will] be disappointed in that outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Other people, of course, would be even more disappointed if it had gone to Bonn [in Germany] without a COP president in place.

They are set to be introduced next year.\n\nThe Victorian government introduced a taskforce to tackle underquoting in 2022. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nUnderquoting occurs when a property is deliberately advertised for less than its estimated selling price or the owner's asking price.\n\nDespite underquoting being illegal, the Victorian government has acknowledged it remains a significant issue in the real estate industry.\n\nA taskforce it established late in 2022 to crack down on the practice has received more than 5,000 complaints.\n\nHopeful homebuyers have told the ABC about their \"demoralising\" and \"exhausting\" experiences attending auctions for properties advertised within an acceptable price range that they ultimately couldn't afford.\n\nVictorian Minister for Consumer Affairs Nick Staikos said the changes unveiled on Thursday were \"a big step forward\".\n\n\"Underquoting isn't fair, and it's young Victorians and families who are the ones paying for it,\" he said.\n\n\"This will mean that no longer will young prospective first home buyers have to waste their time on a property sales campaign when they never could afford the property in the first place.\"\n\nMinnister Nick Staikos said the changes would stop young homebuyers attending auctions for properties they couldn't afford.

(Supplied: CSIRO)\n\nStart-ups need \"off take\" agreements to attract capital, but they often struggle to find buyers for their produce when their manufacturing facilities are still in the pilot phase.\n\nSydney company All G is among those heading overseas to access the high tech plant needed to make alternative proteins.\n\nChief scientist Jared Raynes said they want to expand their operation in Australia but there are limitations.\n\n\"It's really challenging to scale up because the infrastructure just doesn't exist in Australia,\" he said.\n\nAll G produce lactoferrin, a key ingredient in baby formula.\n\nIt usually comes from cows milk, but All G claims it can be produced much more efficiently by inserting the gene that produces lactoferrin into a special yeast.\n\n\"We do this in a bioreactor, a fancy type of fermenter, in a process not too dissimilar to brewing beer,\" Mr Raynes said.\n\nThey use sugar as a feedstock and potatoes as a source of proteins, and no animal products are used in this process.\n\n\"It usually takes 10,000 litres of milk to produce one kilogram of lactoferrin, [but] we can produce one kilogram with less than a thousand litres using fermentation,\" Mr Raynes said.\n\nJared Raynes of All G says Australia's pilot plants do not meet his company's needs. (Supplied: All G)\n\nPrecision fermenters take microorganisms like yeast, bacteria and fungi, together with a feed stock, and turns them into egg proteins, enzymes, flavours, colours, fats and oils.\n\nA precision fermentation plant has been built in Tasmania and two pilot plants are due to open next year, one in Werribee in Victoria and a second at Mackay in Queensland.\n\nBut Jared Raynes said they do not meet his company's needs.\n\nAs a result, All G has signed a partnership with a German food company to access a plant there.\n\nIndustry lobby group Cellular Agriculture Australia claims producing food this way requires less water and land, results in less emissions and does not cause deforestation and biodiversity loss.\n\nBut scientists warn that full life cycle assessment studies on the entire supply chain for alternative protein products are \"very limited [and] the impacts of microbe-derived proteins and cultured meat have not been fully assessed\".\n\nWhat are alternative proteins?\n\nSausages are an example of alternative protein products, this one made mainly from soy. (Supplied: Food Frontiers)\n\nAlternative proteins are being promoted as a possible solution to feed a growing world population.\n\nProducts include meat and seafood substitutes and specialised food ingredients made from soy, peas, hemp seeds and ancient grains like quinoa.\n\nThere are emerging products as well using insect-based ingredients and meat cultivated from animal cells or produced via fermentation.\n\nIn its report on the plant protein industry an independent think tank on alternative proteins in Australia and New Zealand, Food Frontier, reported the value of global plant protein ingredients was more than $24 billion in 2024 and was expected to triple by 2032.\n\nThe Grains & Legumes Nutrition Council surveys 2,900 Australian supermarket products, and their audits from 2022 to 2024 show 12 per cent had some plant protein ingredients, particularly in plant-based food and beverage products.\n\nAustralian market too small\n\nAustralia currently has six plant protein ingredient manufacturers, but most of them are limited in scale and capacity.\n\nManildra has a plant in Nowra in New South Wales which processes a million tonnes of wheat annually and turns it into concentrates, isolates, flours and starches that go into plant products.\n\nIntegra is a plant protein manufacturer based in SA, one of six alternative protein plants across the country. (Supplied: Food Frontiers)\n\nFive new plants have been established in the last six years in Victoria (Essantis), Western Australia (Wide Open Agriculture), Victoria (Australian Plant Proteins), Tasmania (Hemp Harvests) and South Australia (Integra Foods).\n\nUnlike traditional flour mills or pressing plants, these plants use a process called fractionation to concentrate and extract the primary protein ingredients from the flours of cereals, pulses and oilseeds.\n\nPlant-based patties look like meat but are made from completely vegan ingredients. (ABC News: Cam Lang)\n\nThe Grains & Legumes Nutrition Council found the need for plant protein ingredients is expected to grow because food service companies are looking for high fibre, protein-rich foods for the health care sector in particular.\n\nDespite that, Professor Brent Kaiser from Sydney University said the market was just not big enough to attract venture capital in Australia because alternative proteins were not a high priority for the average shopper.\n\n\"Until consumers have a better understanding of food security, and they choose to buy an alternative protein because it's sustainably produced, the market will remain small,\" he said.",

    "text": "The Wallabies haven\u2019t scored more than 19 points in a Test since racking up 24 against New Zealand in Auckland in the opening Bledisloe Cup clash. The points conceded has also blown out by an average of four a game, leaving an average losing margin of 10 points a game. With a struggling attack, tries have dried up, falling from 3.6 a Test to 1.7, and they\u2019re also conceding an average of one more per Test. Most tellingly, the Wallabies\u2019 ability to score points in the second half has drastically fallen away. Though far from ideal, Australia had developed a habit of giving up a big deficit in the first halves of many of their Tests earlier in the year, but then fought back late to either win or lose narrowly.\n\nBut that second-half capacity has almost evaporated. From an average of more than 15 second-half points in the opening eight Tests, the Wallabies have averaged less than five points in the Bledisloe Cup and on the spring tour. They didn\u2019t score a single point in the second half against England. By contrast, their rivals have run up 98 second-half points at an averaged 16 a Test. Injuries and the unavailability of players have been factors, of course, with the Wallabies\u2019 depth \u2013 and bench strength \u2013 eroded with key men being lost throughout the year. Star fullback Tom Wright was a big loss, and so too Tate McDermott. Jake Gordon\u2019s injury was covered by Nic White until the veteran No.9 finally retired for good. Rob Valetini struggled with injury throughout the year.\n\nThe Wallabies cycled through multiple five-eighths, too, with Noah Lolesio lost early and Tom Lynagh also in and out of the squad. James O\u2019Connor, Tane Edmed and Carter Gordon were also used. But the tendency of coach Joe Schmidt to routinely make changes also raised eyebrows. The Wallabies used the same 23-man squad in consecutive Tests just once all year \u2013 for the second and third Lions games. Like second-half points, Australia\u2019s discipline was also an issue: they started well in that area before falling away. Having been a major problem in previous years, where penalty counts were stubbornly stuck above 10 a game in most Tests, the Australians appeared to have turned a corner in the three-match Lions series, where they conceded less than 10 penalties in two games. Then in South Africa, the Wallabies gave up only four and six penalties.\n\nIn the opening eight Tests, the Wallabies averaged 8.5 penalties a game. But in the six Tests since, that has grown to 11.5 a game, and double-figure counts in four of six games. Most crucially, perhaps, the Wallabies have had players sent from the field in the past six Tests. After not attracting a yellow card in their first seven matches (again a far cry from recent years where one per Test was standard), six yellow cards came in the next seven Tests. The Wallabies have also started making more mistakes \u2013 either making it more difficult to win, or putting nails in coffins. When it comes to unforced errors \u2013 which is a mistake not brought on by the opposition \u2013 the Wallabies were making an average of 4.7 in the opening eight Tests. That has risen to 6.6 a Test since the Wallabies headed to Eden Park hopeful of breaking their Bledisloe Cup drought.\n\nOne of the clear areas Australia have struggled in for much of the year, but particularly on the spring tour, is in the air. Though an increasingly common part of top-flight rugby, the attack-minded Wallabies have never been a world-leading team when it comes to contestable kicks; be it defusing them or successfully deploying them. But they hadn\u2019t been known as one of the world\u2019s worst, either. Until this year, that is. The Wallabies have struggled so much to \u201cretain\u201d contestable kicks \u2013 the stat covering the ability to either catch a high ball, clean up a spilled catch or force an error from a rival \u2013 they\u2019re ranked second-last of the 10 Six Nations-Rugby Championships teams in 2025. Surprisingly, the All Blacks have the worst retention rate.\n\nBut the problem is now so acute for the Wallabies that teams are building game plans around contestable kicking. England kicked with good effect in downing the Wallabies at Twickenham, scoring two of four tries from high balls, while Ireland\u2019s win was based on attacking Australia from the air. Loading The Wallabies\u2019 aerial struggle is like a batsman who is known to dislike short-pitched bowling, and thus gets bounced almost every over. So perception plays a big part, and it\u2019ll only change if the Wallabies turn off the retention tap for rivals. The difference can be seen in comparing the Wallabies\u2019 first Test against the Lions and their loss to Ireland. In both games, their rivals sent up 15 contestable kicks. The Lions only managed to retain six of them, and thus dialled back the contestable kick tally to just three in the second Test. But the Irish remarkably retained all 15.",

    "text": "Still, Bowen, looking grey and drawn, was determined to put a positive spin on a thorough diplomatic rout of Australia by Turkey.\n\nNot only that, the crucial leaders\u2019 meeting that traditionally runs before or during the first days of those talks would also be held in Turkey. And as host, Turkey would appoint the COP president to run the event and manage the mechanics of the world\u2019s key multilateral machine to combat climate change for the succeeding year, as the rules dictated.\n\nIt was after 10pm in Belem, Brazil, when Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen finally conceded publicly that, after a three-year campaign spanning the Pacific and the world for a role Australia believed was all but locked in, Turkey would host next year\u2019s United Nations COP climate talks.\n\nAustralia\u2019s goals in the bid, he said, were to elevate the concerns of the Pacific and to act in the nation\u2019s best interests. To that end, he had secured an in-principle agreement that he would serve at the talks under the title of \u201cpresident of negotiations\u201d, with authority to set the negotiating agenda, appoint chairs and leads and prepare the draft decision text.\n\nA pre-COP meeting would be held in the Pacific, which Australia would use to browbeat participants to contribute to a Pacific Resilience Fund.\n\nThis is not nothing. Anyone who has watched UN climate negotiations up close knows the roles of those who drive them are powerful and significant. The Pacific will be devastated by Australia\u2019s failure, but it will not turn down any finance that might be extracted at such a forum.\n\nBowen insists that had he not blinked, and had the meeting reverted to the UN climate headquarters in Bonne, the result would have been a rudderless meeting at which Australia and the Pacific had no control.\n\n\u201cSome people will be disappointed in that outcome,\u201d he said to reporters during a gap in ongoing negotiations in Belem.",

We now need to be doing everything we can to drive the phase out of fossil fuels and to ensure we limit warming to 1.5 degrees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has praised the decision as \"a big win\", despite the government spending months campaigning to host the summit.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The tiny island taking one of the world's most valuable companies to court\n\n\"We're in a situation where it would not have advantaged multilateral action on climate change if we couldn't even agree on where a conference was, would have been a real setback,\" he told ABC Radio Perth on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen outlined the model in Belem, Brazil, saying it met Australia's three objectives: elevating Pacific voices, supporting multilateralism, and safeguarding national interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a little way to go,\" he said, with the Western Europe and Others Group to meet again within 24 hours, \"but a model in which pre-COP is hosted in the Pacific \u2026 and the COP is held in T\u00fcrkiye, but Australia, myself, is appointed COP President for Negotiations \u2026 is an outcome which achieves those objectives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBowen said the pre-COP event would be held in a Pacific Island nation and would double as a pledging meeting for the Pacific Resilience Fund.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Thousands march in Brazil in first big UN climate protest in years\n\nThe summit itself would take place in T\u00fcrkiye, avoiding a collapse of negotiations that would have forced COP31 to default to Bonn, Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters said it was \"an embarrassing outcome\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was clear from the start that the government didn\u2019t really want to host a climate summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The prime minister never really wanted to host a climate conference if it meant being honest about the future of coal and gas while his mining corporation mates are watching. If COP came to Australia, it would have been a good opportunity for the world\u2019s leaders to grill Labor for their terrible track record on climate action.\"\n\n\n\nBowen defends concession\n\nBowen stressed the compromise was necessary to avoid the worst-case scenario: \"with a lack of leadership, no COP President in place, no plan,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That would mean 12 months with a lack of leadership \u2026 that would be irresponsible for multilateralism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked whether Australia had made a major concession, Bowen said T\u00fcrkiye had also given ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe clarified the split presidency model: T\u00fcrkiye would be COP president for hosting and logistics, while he would hold \"all the powers of COP presidency to manage the negotiations, to appoint co-facilitators, to prepare draft text, and to issue the cover decision.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Thousands march in Brazil in first big UN climate protest in years\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley said she believed T\u00fcrkiye is doing the Australian government a favour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that this government even considered spending $2 billion of taxpayers money on this exercise just goes to show how their priorities are all wrong,\" she said on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chris Bowen is very disappointed today, I am sure, but Australians should be very pleased with the decision that was taken away from this country and made overseas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile refusing to say exactly how much the federal government has spent on drawing the COP31 summit to Australia, Albanese defended the cost as a \"relatively small amount\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBowen said some would be disappointed, but more would have been disappointed \"if it had gone to Bonn without a COP President in place\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a better outcome than that.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than two hours by ferry from the grit and gridlock of megacity Jakarta, Pari Island seems almost too good to be true.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indonesian capital's 10 million people are swapped for just 1,500. Children spend all day playing barefoot on sandy white beaches, while pristine turquoise seas lap around them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you notice the swing sets and picnic tables peaking out of the water.\n\n\n\n\n\nArif Pujianto lives about 50 metres from the water - unless there's a high tide, he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring high tides or tidal floods, it comes right into the house, up to about here. You can still see the marks. When the tidal flood hit, it got in here, left all this damage, made things rot and fall apart.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLocals say life on this island was steady for generations, but over the past decade it has undergone a dramatic transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll around the shore, structures that used to sit on land are now permanently submerged.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalists monitoring Pari Island say 11 per cent has already been swallowed by the sea, with some projecting the entire island will be underwater by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that happens, locals like Pujianto say they will have nowhere to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, this is my island, the place I\u2019ve lived since I was a child. It\u2019s predicted that by 2030 or 2040, more small islands will sink or disappear. So it\u2019s not impossible that inhabited islands, too, could sink or become too damaged to live on. If that ever happens \u2014 I really hope it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I filed this lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to name a place that has contributed less to human-induced climate change than Pari Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not a single car on the island; the community grows and catches much of its food; they've even planted thousands of carbon-capturing mangroves along the coastline in a bid to protect it from further erosion.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet it's one of the places in Indonesia where the effects of climate change are being felt most acutely.\n\n\n\n\n\nRising tides have damaged homes, warming waters have ruined once-lucrative seaweed farms, and rapidly changing weather patterns have made fishing largely unprofitable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community is now demanding damages, having launched a landmark legal case against Swiss cement giant Holcim over its historic carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeaweed farmer Ibu Asmania is one of the four plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's not like we just suddenly decided to sue Holcim. We studied this for a long time before choosing Holcim, because their emissions are among the highest in the world. The warming we're feeling now is caused by the massive emissions they've been producing since the 1950s.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cement industry accounts for around 8 per cent of global carbon emissions annually, mostly due to the extreme heat needed to produce clinker, which is one of the main ingredients in cement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolcim is the industry's biggest player, worth more than $75 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsmania and the other plaintiffs are seeking about $6,800 each, arguing Holcim is responsible for 0.42 per cent of all global emissions since 1950 and should therefore pay for the same proportion of the damage caused to Pari Island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we're demanding first is for Holcim to cut its emissions, and secondly, to repair the environmental damage on Pari Island, through restoration, disaster mitigation, mangrove replanting and building wave barriers. It would mean our sea could recover, the fish could come back, and the whole ecosystem could heal again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAsmania and her husband, Sartono, have operated a small seaweed farm just off the coast of Pari Island for 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost every family on the island used to farm seaweed, but today she says only five are still trying.\n\n\n\n\n\nRising sea temperatures are bleaching their crops, making them largely unharvestable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community's other main source of income \u2014 fishing \u2014 has not spared the impacts of climate change either.\n\n\n\n\n\nBang Bobby is another plaintiff in the Holcim case. He remembers first going out to sea with his parents in his fifth year of primary school. Now 53 years old, he says he has been fishing the waters off Pari Island ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe could still predict the seasons back then, including the wind directions month to month. Back in the day, during the easterly winds around August, we'd catch tuna mackerel and scads. Then, as the seasons shifted to westerlies around March or April, we'd catch Spanish mackerel, baby tuna, and lots of others. Now, even though we\u2019re experienced, we can\u2019t predict nature anymore \u2014 every forecast is completely off.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby says fish populations have declined across the island, which means local fishers need to travel much further out to sea to find their daily catch.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the region's eight-month-long wet season, when storms are sudden and intense, they often need to turn back before catching anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference in Bobby's income is dramatic; he used to turn a profit of around $500-$600 per month, but now, he says he is lucky to make $150.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is something we have to do. Even though Pari Island is far from Holcim's factories, the emissions they produce have caused the climate change that's reached us here. Imagine a big basin filled with water. If you drop even a small stone into it, it still creates ripples and waves that reach everywhere. It's the same with emissions. You can't see them with your eyes, but their impact is real and we can feel it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNo community has ever successfully sued a corporation on another continent over its carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Peruvian farmer spent the better part of a decade attempting to launch a lawsuit against German energy giant RWE, arguing its carbon emissions contributed to glacial flooding in his hometown, but the court rejected his case in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nMas Bagus from the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, which is assisting the Pari Island community with its legal case, say that if it is successful, it could set an important precedent for other communities seeking climate justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that emissions, and therefore the climate crisis, cannot be contained within administrative borders. They contribute to impacts in regions far beyond where they are produced. Of course, other corporations should also be held accountable. We invite others to do the same. Today it's Holcim, tomorrow it could be other companies that must also take responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pari Island plaintiffs travelled to Switzerland in September to make their case and are now awaiting the court's decision on whether to consider their complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a Holcim spokesperson said: \"In our opinion, the question of who is allowed to emit how much CO2 is a matter for the legislature and not a question for a civil court... We await the court's decision, yet regardless of the outcome, Holcim is fully committed to reaching net zero by 2050.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then, the people of Pari Island fear it will be too late.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdi Mulyono is the fourth and final plaintiff in the case against Holcim.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he is doing this for his children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't know how long I'll live; maybe I'll die tomorrow, but I've got three kids; the eldest is in high school, the youngest is still in kindergarten. What I fear most is what will happen when my children grow up and have their own kids. Where will they live if this island keeps eroding and disappearing because of coastal abrasion and tidal floods? That's what's always on my mind. That's why I'm still doing everything I can to protect this island from sinking.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT THIS STORY Feature The tiny island taking one of the world's most valuable companies to court\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Poorly performing retiree superannuation products could reduce income by $57,000 to $205,000 over the course of retirement, a new report has revealed, leading a consumer group to call for protections for retired Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report by Super Consumers Australia (SCA) found all of the options that failed the government\u2019s annual performance test this year were also offered to retirees.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the government's exclusions do not apply to products offered to retirees, so people with their retirement savings invested in them are none the wiser.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is currently reviewing the performance test, while the SCA is urging it to immediately extend the test to protect retirees.\n\n\n\nSCA deputy CEO Katrina Ellis said: \"It\u2019s unreasonable that a 64-year-old is protected by a performance test, yet the moment they retire and move into an identical product, that safeguard disappears.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Securing Australia\u2019s Retirement: It\u2019s time to protect retirees from dud investment options' report revealed that 91 per cent of failed investment options in the past three years were also available in the retirement phase at the time of failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the analysis stated retirees are invested in all seven of the options that failed the 2025 performance test.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther funds, including AMP, Russell Investments, Colonial First State and REST, offered underperforming retirement products across multiple growth categories.\n\n\n\nAn AMP spokesperson told SBS News: \"(AMP) strongly rejects the narrow analysis and irresponsible claims made in the Super Consumers report, which gives a misleading picture for Australians considering where to invest their retirement savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The report also fails to take into proper account the different objectives of retirement products, or consider contemporary lifetime income retirement solutions, which are delivering significantly better outcomes for retirees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA Russell Investments spokesperson said they were aware of the report and claimed the figures cited for its fund\u2019s options \"are not accurate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nColonial First State said \"In regard to options in the report, APRA assessed the accumulation equivalent of these same retirement investment options and they passed the annual superannuation performance test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These options are managed consistently across both accumulation and retirement phases, including the same asset allocation, benchmarks, and investment managers. On that basis, had the performance test been applied to the retirement phase these options would have passed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS also contacted REST for comment but they had not responded by the time of publication.\n\n\n\nSCA said almost three-quarters of Australians support extending the performance test to retirement products, with even more calling for greater transparency so retirees can compare how their fund performs.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllis said: \"The superannuation system is meant to provide Australians with a dignified retirement, not leave them in the dark about whether their money is working for them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Retirees deserve the same protections as workers. Without them, people risk losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement income and living standards will suffer.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The odds of job seekers finding entry-level work are so low that \"even the most determined will be left behind\", according to new research from Anglicare Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anti-poverty organisation's latest annual Jobs Availability Snapshot, released on Thursday, compared the number of people receiving JobSeeker payments with the number of positions advertised in August this year that require little formal education or experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found that for every entry-level vacancy, there were 39 job seekers \u2014 an increase on last year's figure of 35.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-five of those 39 people are considered to have barriers to work, meaning they have been receiving JobSeeker payments for a least a year.\n\n\n\n\"That's the worst we've seen \u2014 and this is our 10th year of this snapshot,\" Anglicare Australia executive director Kasy Chambers told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are one of those people who've been on JobSeeker for three years, you've only got partial ability to work, or you haven't got English as your first language and you're competing with 38 other job seekers who have, you're going to find it difficult.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that anyone can apply for entry-level jobs and more people were taking on extra work due to the cost of living, there was likely \"greater competition than even we are measuring\", she added.\n\n\n\nWhy is it getting worse?\n\nChambers said one of the reasons the situation was getting worse was because the \"list of people who are long-term unemployed is getting bigger, and those who are long-term unemployed are staying unemployed for longer\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost one in four JobSeeker recipients have been getting the payment for five or more years, compared to just one in 10 a decade ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longer someone is unemployed, the harder it is for them to get a job, Chambers said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Apart from the fact that you haven't had up-to-date training, you haven't got the networks, but also you've been existing on JobSeeker payments, which is less than half the poverty line, so you are likely to be getting a bit worn,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Things like medication, dentistry, all those kind of things that many of us are lucky enough to take for granted, you're not going to be able to [access].\"\n\n\n\nAnglicare Australia executive director Kasy Chambers said the current employment system is failing those most in need of work. Source: AAP / Dominic Giannini The model employment service providers operate under makes them ineffective in helping people find suitable work, Chambers said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen a lot of inquiries about it, we all know that it's not working, and yet we spend billions of dollars on it every year into private companies,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We hear ridiculous stories about these employment service providers denying somebody the ability to go to a job interview because they want them to go to some training that day, putting people with partial ability to work due to spinal conditions through barista courses, which is about standing all day \u2014 just really stupid things that are a churn of activity, but are absolutely meaningless and really they don't result in people getting good training, and they don't result in getting people into jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall number of job advertisements has also been steadily declining over the past three years, according to figures from the Internet Vacancy Index, with the sharpest drop (37 per cent) among entry-level roles.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Need a new job? These are the top 10 skills Australian employers are looking for\n\nChambers said as automation and artificial intelligence advance and jobs are increasingly mechanised, that downward trend was likely to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Entry-level jobs are under threat \u2014 and we need to do something about it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will always have people who haven't finished year 12, gone straight into a degree and then churn themselves out into the job that that degree was designed for, or the VET course.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report noted that the employment of checkout operators and cashiers had fallen by 20.6 per cent over the past five years, according to federal government figures, which reflected the rise of self-service technology.\n\n\n\nWhat reforms are needed?\n\nChambers said the findings showed the urgent need to reform Australia's employment system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The jobs are not there, so it's not the person's fault \u2014 it is a structural issue,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare Australia's first recommendation is for the government to create quality entry-level jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChambers suggested entry-level roles in the care economy as an area of opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are plenty of places where we could be creative, but while we ask the market to do everything for us, that's not going to happen.\"\n\n\n\nAnglicare Australia is also calling for employment services to be overhauled so people are given appropriate support to find suitable and sustainable work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is about talking to the person, finding out what their skills and strengths are and helping them match those to something that's available in their area, if there is something,\" Chambers said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of income support payments like JobSeeker also needs to be lifted above the poverty line, she said, so people can afford to look after their basic needs while they look for work or undergo training.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum JobSeeker payment a single person without children can receive is $793.60 per fortnight, which equates to $20,633.60 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We cannot keep pretending that JobSeeker is an interim payment for a couple of weeks just to get people over a bad patch,\" Chambers said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the federal employment minister for comment.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAs New South Wales Premier Chris Minns points out, it's rare to see premiers across states and territories are united.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, right across Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, different states, different political parties run those states, we can't all be wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state premiers and territory chief ministers have teamed up to accuse the federal government of back-flipping on its promise on public hospital funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2023, the federal and state governments agreed a new funding model for public hospitals, which would see the Commonwealth increasing its share of public hospital costs to 42.5 per cent by 2031.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to Mr Minns, the latest offer from the federal government is just 37 per cent of of the costs, which he says is a massive decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The federal government's got a lot of far deeper pockets than the states do, but we are responsible for service delivery, and we need a new deal here, because what's being offered is just not good enough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changing position of the federal government occurred in September, when the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reportedly issued a letter to Premiers and state health ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Mr Albanese reportedly urged the state governments to cut hospital spending, if they wanted a new funding deal to be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking from Western Australia along with WA Premier Roger Cook, Mr Albanese says he and the premiers are working through the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we have on the table is an increased amount of funding, and indeed people talk about the agreement, what was on the table at that time was $30 billion, we currently have $20 billion on the table, we were working those issues through, $20 billion is a substantial increase in health funding for hospitals.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Cabinet will meet again this week to discuss the issue, but the Opposition leader Sussan Ley says the Albanese government's backflipping is a sign of failed budgeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Isn't' it extraordinary that the Prime Minister is mismanaging the economy so badly, that he is now forced to write to health ministers?\"\n\n\n\nThe dispute comes to a head as experts point to a public hospital system under mounting pressure, from ambulance ramping to overcrowding in hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation has been worsening, despite a surge in public hospital spending in recent years.\n\n\n\nPeter Breadon is the Health Program Director at the Grattan Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new report, his team suggest that state governments can cut back billions of dollars of avoidable hospital spending.\n\n\n\n\"We found that conservatively there's about 1.2 billion a year in the system that isn't helping patients and could be better spent. That includes shorter hospital stays. We spend longer in hospital in Australia for many surgeries where a lot of people could go home the same day compared to other wealthy countries.\"\n\n\n\nHis report is also calling on the Commonwealth to increase its contribution to hospital funding in line with growing demand for care.\n\n",

    "text": "A long-running bin dispute in Birmingham, United Kingdom, has entered a new phase, as agency staff \u2014 who until now kept the service running \u2014 voted to join the strike over what they describe as bullying, harassment, and unsustainable workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bin strike has taken place since the beginning of the year, leading to large piles of waste building up intermittently, in one of the UK's biggest cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnite, the trade union representing the striking workers, said 18 of 22 agency workers employed via the workforce platform, Job & Talent, have voted to officially join picket lines from 1 December.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have already turned back at the picket lines, saying a \"toxic\" workplace culture in the refuse service has made it impossible for them to keep working, the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move comes as hundreds of refuse workers, who have been on all-out strike since March, voted overwhelmingly to extend their industrial action \u2014 possibly pushing disruption well beyond the May 2026 local elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith rubbish piling up, contingency crews stretched, and both sides publicly hardening their stance, Birmingham's bin saga appears set for its most prolonged chapter yet.\n\n\n\nThe strike is further complicated by the Birmingham City Council's bankruptcy, which has forced reliance on contingency plans and agency staff. Source: Getty / Jacob King\n\nWhen did this dispute start?\n\nThe standoff started with Birmingham City Council's decision to remove a senior role on each bin crew in August 2024 \u2014 a position Unite maintains is \"safety-critical\". The council has insisted it was not industry standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion members escalated from targeted action in January 2025 to a full walkout in March, after pay for drivers and senior loaders was reportedly slashed by as much as \u00a38,000 ($16,000) a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers warned the cut \u2014 more than 20 per cent of annual pay \u2014 would leave families struggling to eat and, in some cases, keep their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnite argued the dispute worsened when the council reportedly fired and rehired heavy goods vehicle drivers to force them onto lower rates. It also alleged the council refused to provide evidence to support its claim that equal pay concerns prevented any deal.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE UK Labour strips asylum seeker rights amid surging support for Nigel Farage's Reform party\n\nThroughout the dispute, Unite has insisted it remains willing to negotiate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the council, according to the union, backed away from a \"ballpark deal\" reached with CEO Joanne Roney in May \u2014 leaving talks frozen for months.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: \"Unite has rejected all our offers.\"\n\n\n\nHow did it spiral to this week's escalation?\n\nThe strike has already lasted eight months and drawn global attention, with images of overflowing bins, black bags lining streets and long queues outside temporary waste drop-off points.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnite said 99.5 per cent of its workers backed an extension of the strike on a 75 per cent turnout, suggesting staff feel the dispute is nowhere near resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nInto this already tense environment, the agency workforce \u2014 crucial to keeping basic collections going \u2014 stepped forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob & Talent staff have long been embedded in the refuse service. The agency confirms its numbers have not increased during the strike.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut those workers have alleged the workload has become unmanageable and the treatment intolerable.\n\n\n\nUnite has reported claims of bullying and harassment, which includes footage of a Job & Talent manager warning staff they risked being blacklisted by council chiefs if they refused to cross picket lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob & Talent rejects the allegations and stresses it takes any welfare concerns \"extremely seriously\". A spokesperson said it operates with \"transparency, integrity and full compliance with employment laws\" and will not tolerate intimidation against workers participating in industrial action.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial relations specialist Roger Seifert, from the University of Wolverhampton, described it as having evolved far beyond a typical workplace dispute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told the BBC that once councils rely heavily on agencies, \"pressure builds up\", gets shifted down the chain and produces \"bad blood\" \u2014 leaving residents to endure a worsening service.\n\n\n\nWhat is each side saying now?\n\nUnite has described the agency walkout as a \"real escalation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSharon Graham, the union's general secretary, said workers are striking because of \"the terrible way they have been treated by Job & Talent and Birmingham council\", accusing the council of spending \"a fortune it doesn't have\" instead of agreeing a fair deal.\n\n\n\nUnite's national lead officer Onay Kasab said residents have every right to worry about strikes stretching through Christmas, New Year and into the election period, but blamed the council for the deadlock. He said the union is still committed to \"meaningful negotiations\" and wants bullying and blacklisting \"stamped out\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBirmingham City Council maintains Unite has \"rejected all our offers\" and insists its contingency plan is working. A spokesperson said the council is collecting around 1,330 tonnes of kerbside waste daily \u2014 more than before the strike \u2014 and more than 100,000 tonnes over the past six months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council said it will continue providing at least one collection a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council also emphasised that the agency dispute does not sit with them but with Job & Talent, describing it as involving only \"a small number\" of workers.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nWith Birmingham City Council now formally bankrupt, residents fear they will ultimately bear the cost of the stalemate.\n\n\n\nUnite's accountants estimate the dispute could cost the council \u00a315 million ($30 million) over 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, both sides remain entrenched.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnite said the path out is simple: a fair deal on pay and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council insists its reforms are \"long overdue\" and it will press on.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The Wallabies haven\u2019t scored more than 19 points in a Test since racking up 24 against New Zealand in Auckland in the opening Bledisloe Cup clash. The points conceded has also blown out by an average of four a game, leaving an average losing margin of 10 points a game. With a struggling attack, tries have dried up, falling from 3.6 a Test to 1.7, and they\u2019re also conceding an average of one more per Test. Most tellingly, the Wallabies\u2019 ability to score points in the second half has drastically fallen away. Though far from ideal, Australia had developed a habit of giving up a big deficit in the first halves of many of their Tests earlier in the year, but then fought back late to either win or lose narrowly.\n\nBut that second-half capacity has almost evaporated. From an average of more than 15 second-half points in the opening eight Tests, the Wallabies have averaged less than five points in the Bledisloe Cup and on the spring tour. They didn\u2019t score a single point in the second half against England. By contrast, their rivals have run up 98 second-half points at an averaged 16 a Test. Injuries and the unavailability of players have been factors, of course, with the Wallabies\u2019 depth \u2013 and bench strength \u2013 eroded with key men being lost throughout the year. Star fullback Tom Wright was a big loss, and so too Tate McDermott. Jake Gordon\u2019s injury was covered by Nic White until the veteran No.9 finally retired for good. Rob Valetini struggled with injury throughout the year.\n\nThe Wallabies cycled through multiple five-eighths, too, with Noah Lolesio lost early and Tom Lynagh also in and out of the squad. James O\u2019Connor, Tane Edmed and Carter Gordon were also used. But the tendency of coach Joe Schmidt to routinely make changes also raised eyebrows. The Wallabies used the same 23-man squad in consecutive Tests just once all year \u2013 for the second and third Lions games. Like second-half points, Australia\u2019s discipline was also an issue: they started well in that area before falling away. Having been a major problem in previous years, where penalty counts were stubbornly stuck above 10 a game in most Tests, the Australians appeared to have turned a corner in the three-match Lions series, where they conceded less than 10 penalties in two games. Then in South Africa, the Wallabies gave up only four and six penalties.\n\nIn the opening eight Tests, the Wallabies averaged 8.5 penalties a game. But in the six Tests since, that has grown to 11.5 a game, and double-figure counts in four of six games. Most crucially, perhaps, the Wallabies have had players sent from the field in the past six Tests. After not attracting a yellow card in their first seven matches (again a far cry from recent years where one per Test was standard), six yellow cards came in the next seven Tests. The Wallabies have also started making more mistakes \u2013 either making it more difficult to win, or putting nails in coffins. When it comes to unforced errors \u2013 which is a mistake not brought on by the opposition \u2013 the Wallabies were making an average of 4.7 in the opening eight Tests. That has risen to 6.6 a Test since the Wallabies headed to Eden Park hopeful of breaking their Bledisloe Cup drought.\n\nOne of the clear areas Australia have struggled in for much of the year, but particularly on the spring tour, is in the air. Though an increasingly common part of top-flight rugby, the attack-minded Wallabies have never been a world-leading team when it comes to contestable kicks; be it defusing them or successfully deploying them. But they hadn\u2019t been known as one of the world\u2019s worst, either. Until this year, that is. The Wallabies have struggled so much to \u201cretain\u201d contestable kicks \u2013 the stat covering the ability to either catch a high ball, clean up a spilled catch or force an error from a rival \u2013 they\u2019re ranked second-last of the 10 Six Nations-Rugby Championships teams in 2025. Surprisingly, the All Blacks have the worst retention rate.\n\nBut the problem is now so acute for the Wallabies that teams are building game plans around contestable kicking. England kicked with good effect in downing the Wallabies at Twickenham, scoring two of four tries from high balls, while Ireland\u2019s win was based on attacking Australia from the air. Loading The Wallabies\u2019 aerial struggle is like a batsman who is known to dislike short-pitched bowling, and thus gets bounced almost every over. So perception plays a big part, and it\u2019ll only change if the Wallabies turn off the retention tap for rivals. The difference can be seen in comparing the Wallabies\u2019 first Test against the Lions and their loss to Ireland. In both games, their rivals sent up 15 contestable kicks. The Lions only managed to retain six of them, and thus dialled back the contestable kick tally to just three in the second Test. But the Irish remarkably retained all 15.",

    "text": "Still, Bowen, looking grey and drawn, was determined to put a positive spin on a thorough diplomatic rout of Australia by Turkey.\n\nNot only that, the crucial leaders\u2019 meeting that traditionally runs before or during the first days of those talks would also be held in Turkey. And as host, Turkey would appoint the COP president to run the event and manage the mechanics of the world\u2019s key multilateral machine to combat climate change for the succeeding year, as the rules dictated.\n\nIt was after 10pm in Belem, Brazil, when Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen finally conceded publicly that, after a three-year campaign spanning the Pacific and the world for a role Australia believed was all but locked in, Turkey would host next year\u2019s United Nations COP climate talks.\n\nAustralia\u2019s goals in the bid, he said, were to elevate the concerns of the Pacific and to act in the nation\u2019s best interests. To that end, he had secured an in-principle agreement that he would serve at the talks under the title of \u201cpresident of negotiations\u201d, with authority to set the negotiating agenda, appoint chairs and leads and prepare the draft decision text.\n\nA pre-COP meeting would be held in the Pacific, which Australia would use to browbeat participants to contribute to a Pacific Resilience Fund.\n\nThis is not nothing. Anyone who has watched UN climate negotiations up close knows the roles of those who drive them are powerful and significant. The Pacific will be devastated by Australia\u2019s failure, but it will not turn down any finance that might be extracted at such a forum.\n\nBowen insists that had he not blinked, and had the meeting reverted to the UN climate headquarters in Bonne, the result would have been a rudderless meeting at which Australia and the Pacific had no control.\n\n\u201cSome people will be disappointed in that outcome,\u201d he said to reporters during a gap in ongoing negotiations in Belem.",

(PR IMAGE PHOTO)\n\nDespite losing out on hosting rights Mr Albanese insisted the negotiated outcome was a \"big win\" for Australia.\n\n\"We will be the negotiator on climate policy globally over the next year and during the conference. That is a very worthwhile investment,\" he told the ABC on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Had we not put in bid for the COP that certainly wouldn't have occurred, and that will enable us to prioritise the issues that are confronting the Pacific, the very existence of countries like Tuvulu and Kiribati.\"\n\nMr Bowen said he kept Pacific hopes front and centre through the negotiations, with the compromise model including a \"pre-COP\" event in the Pacific which will act as a pledging event for a Pacific climate financing fund.\n\n\"Obviously, it would be great if Australia could have it all. But we can't have it all,\" he said on Thursday (AEDT).\n\nThe decision comes at a time of renewed focus on Australian energy and climate policy, given the Sussan Ley-led opposition's call to walk away from net zero.\n\nCritics of the bid, including Ms Ley, baulked at the likely cost of staging the summit, which had been estimated to cost at least hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Turkey is doing the Australian government a big favour,\" she told the ABC on Thursday.\n\n\"We had a $12 billion deficit last year. We're heading to a $42 billion deficit this coming year, and meanwhile, this prime minister wants to spend $2 billion on hosting a talkfest here in this country?\"\n\nMr Albanese said only \"a small amount\" had been spent on the bid by the government, and South Australia, on campaigning and preparations.\n\n\"The amount that has been (spent) has been promoting Adelaide, of course, to the world, and it's been engaging with our priority about climate policy,\" he said.",
