    "text": "It seemed impossible, but shortly after news broke that an Air India flight had crashed in the city of Ahmedabad, video started circulating on social media showing a man walking from the scene in a bloodstained shirt.\n\nThen, it emerged there was one survivor: a British national of Indian origin, identified as Vishwash Kumar Ramesh by the Hindustan Times .\n\n\"Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed. It all happened so quickly,\" it quoted him as saying in an interview at the hospital where he was being treated.\n\nREAD MORE: The girl who fell 3km from a plane explosion and survived\n\nParts of an Air India plane that crashed on Thursday are seen on top of a building in Ahmedabad, India, Friday, June 13, 2025 (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nHe said he had been visiting family and was returning to the UK with his brother, who had been sitting in a different row. He didn't know if his brother had survived, he said.\n\nAir India later confirmed that of the 242 people on board the flight, 241 had died, making Ramesh the sole survivor.\n\nHis cousin Ajay Valgi told reporters in Leicester, England, that Ramesh had called his family to tell them he's \"fine,\" adding that they were upset about his brother and all of the others who died.\n\nA doctor told CNN that Ramesh's condition was \"not very critical\" and that he could be released in the next couple of days.\n\n\"He has some blood in the images, but he's not very badly injured. He is very comfortable and under strict observation, no issues,\" said Dr. Rajnish Patel, professor and head of surgery at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital.\n\nIndian news outlets have shared a photo of Ramesh's boarding pass, which indicates that he was in seat 11A of the flight, in the emergency exit row, just in front of the plane's left wing. CNN hasn't independently confirmed the veracity of the photo.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Black box recovered as investigations continue into Air India crash\n\nA doctor said he had examined the sole survivor of the Air India crash, whom he identified as Vishwash Kumar Ramesh. (Supplied)\n\nCNN safety analyst and former US Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector David Soucie expressed surprise that someone seated at that part of the plane would survive such a crash.\n\nThat seat is \"right where the spar of the wing would go under and it would be a solid place for the aircraft to hit the ground, but as far as survivability above it, that is incredibly surprising,\" he told CNN.\n\nRamesh told Indian broadcaster Doordarshan that he escaped through a small space near the door by his seat. He said his hand was burned by the flames as he fled from the aircraft.\n\n\"I don't know how I managed to escape,\" Ramesh said, adding that he saw other passengers die in front of him.\n\n\"For some time, I thought I was also going to die. But when I opened my eyes, I realised I was alive and I tried to unbuckle myself from the seat and escape from where I could,\" he said.\n\nRamesh's survival was described as miraculous by a British member of parliament.\n\n\"It's nothing short of a miracle. I have reached out to the family and I'm choosing to respect their privacy at this trying time. But as you may have picked up \u2026 one of his brothers was also on that flight who sadly didn't survive,\" Shivani Raja, member of parliament for Leicester East, told CNN's Max Foster on Thursday.\n\nIndian Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah meeting British plane crash survivor Vishwash Kumar Ramesh. (Indian Ministry of Home Affairs)\n\nPeople inside the BJ Medical College and Hospital hostel were also killed when the plane crashed into it, a senior doctor at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, where a majority of the dead and injured people were taken, told CNN.\n\nThe doctor added that t\ufeffhe death toll is likely to rise.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Swapnil Bhalodia of the Indian Medical Association Medical Students Network said at least three medical students had died in the crash and another 30 were injured.\n\nThe plane was headed for London's Gatwick airport and was carrying Indian, British, Canadian and Portuguese nationals.",

(ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nThe potters spend most of the day firing pots in bins the Broken Hill potters made in 2012 during a workshop with Swedish potter Stefan Jakob.\n\n\"We had a workshop where we made an IKEA rubbish bin into a little kiln and our members bring their little kiln out and we collect up all their little sticks and bits of wood and we fire our pots in the rubbish bins,\" Mrs Langford says.\n\nAdelaide's Nicki Murnane adds wood to the home-made bin kiln used for raku pottery. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nFriendship formed through pottery\n\nJoining the Broken Hill group are five members from the Adelaide Potters Club.\n\nEach year since 2012, potters from the club have been travelling six hours to come to the remote station.\n\n\"They were just really excited about coming and joining us to do this and being able to do these primitive firings,\" Mrs Langford says.\n\nCynthia Langford from Purnamoota Station hosts primitive pottery firings on her property each year. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nAdelaide ceramicist Frances Rogers is attending the firing for the first time and says she loves the simple colour scape.\n\n\"I actually find it really inspiring for the pots \u2014 like you look over and you go, 'OK, I'll use copper red today because that's what I'm looking at,'\" she says.\n\nAdelaide's Frances Rogers made her raku creation at the primitive pottery firing event. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nPersonal trainer Nicki Murnane is returning to Purnamoota for the second time and says it is a great weekend of getting back to nature and meeting lovely people.\n\n\"I always say to people it's a child-like weekend,\" she says.\n\nNicki Murnane has twice been to the primitive pottery firings on the remote outback station. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\n\"The anticipation you get as a kid on Christmas Eve, that's what you get here, and you don't really get that much in life anymore.\n\n\"[It's] the sheer joy of unravelling and opening up and not knowing what you're going to get.\"\n\nPots are draped with corn husks, beetroot leaves, coffee grounds and wire before they go into the fire pit. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nMore accessible pottery\n\nA highlight for the visitors is the raku firings in metal bins that the Broken Hill potters bring from their homes.\n\nRaku pottery is a Japanese firing technique that produces distinctive markings on the surface of the ceramics.\n\nThe Broken Hill potters burn emu feathers or horse hair onto their pots at the weekend event.\n\n\"You open the lid and you put a little sugar on it and if the sugar burns black when it hits the pot then the pots are ready to come out and have feathers put on it,\" Broken Hill Potters Society president Sue Andrews says.\n\nAs part of a raku firing, a Broken Hill potter burns emu feathers onto a pot. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nThe other raku technique they use involves putting a raku glaze on pots and getting it to temperature before quickly removing it to put it in another bin to reduce the glaze and give different colours.\n\nAdelaide ceramicist Frances Rogers says it is a wonderful collective activity.\n\n\"You need all hands on deck \u2026 pulling the pot out and dropping it in the hot barrel and someone's throwing paper and the other ones got the wet paper and you know, everyone's like 'get the lid on' so it's a little bit more adrenaline,\" she says.\n\nRogers says it is making pottery more affordable and accessible.\n\n\"[Proper kilns] will be $4,000. They've just told us we could whip one of these up for about $400 or $450,\" she says.\n\nUnpredictable and spontaneous results\n\nThe potters pack their pots with cow pats to create unique patterns. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nBroken Hill's Lee Quinn has been a potter for 40 years.\n\nShe enjoys the process of making the cow-pat pit.\n\nAs the pots were removed on Sunday morning, Mrs Andrews says it is the best cow pat firing they have had.\n\n\"Its just the colours \u2014 normally it doesn't come this good. I think it was more pots in the cow pat, tightly packed in a smaller drum,\" she says.\n\nSue Andrews says this year's cow pat firing on a remote station was the best they have ever had. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nWaitlist for Broken Hill pottery classes\n\nJoining this weekend was new potter and firefighter Jack Simmonds, who managed to get into day classes at the Broken Hill Potters Society after a three-year wait.\n\n\"I did a sip and clay night probably in 2021 and put my name down for classes and then I got the call-up late last year and they said there's a spot for you Tuesday mornings and I rang my boss and got Tuesday mornings off,\" he says.\n\nBroken Hill's Jack Simmonds has done his first pottery pit firing. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nMrs Langford, who first joined the potters in 1991, says the Broken Hill Potters Society was founded in the mid-1970s by three or four women.\n\nThey sold pots and eventually raised money to buy a kiln together and officially formed a society.\n\nIn time, they purchased an old scout hall and raise funds each year through Mother's Day and Christmas fairs to earn the money to pay for the rates.\n\nThe Broken Hill Potters Society runs weekly classes teaching people pottery skills.

    "text": "True to his word, Adam Scott has hung tough to storm right into contention as a raft of golfing heavyweights floundered during the US Open second round at the beastly Oakmont Country Club.\n\nWhile defending champion Bryson DeChambeau led the exodus of big names to miss the halfway cut, Scott carved out a second straight even-par round of 70 to be tied fourth in the clubhouse.\n\nAustralians at the US Open 36 holes T4: Adam Scott \u2014 Level par\n\nT12: Jason Day \u2014 3-over\n\nT45: Marc Leishman \u2014 6-over\n\nT59: Cam Davis \u2014 7-over\n\nT70: Cameron Smith \u2014 8-over\n\nT80: Min Woo Lee \u2014 9-over Halfway cut at 7-over\n\nContesting his 96th consecutive major, the 44-year-old showed the younger stars how to play major championship golf, repeatedly rebounding from bogeys with birdies to sit just three shots off the pace at the halfway mark of the tournament.\n\nWith the final pairs left on the course, play was suspended due to dangerous weather in the area. However most of those remaining are either safely inside the cut of 7-over or well outside.\n\nFour Australians will be there for the weekend \u2014 Scott, Jason Day, Marc Leishman and Cam Davis. Cameron Smith made a late comeback on his second nine, but left himself too much to do and finished a shot outside the cut on 8-over. Min Woo Lee shot a 2-over 72 to finish on 9-over.\n\nSam Burns fired the low round of the championship, a brilliant 5-under 65 to snare the clubhouse lead at 3-under.\n\nFellow American and first-round leader JJ Spaun is second, one stroke behind Burns, after following up his starting 66 with a 72 on Friday (Saturday AEST).\n\nSeeking his maiden major, Norwegian super talent Viktor Hovland is the only other player above Scott on the leaderboard, and one of only three players in red numbers at one under after posting a second-round 70.\n\nScott's fellow former world number one Day battled back into the picture with the second-lowest round of the day to also raise hopes of a famous Australian triumph at the US Open's most gruelling venue.\n\nThe former PGA champ was way off the pace after his opening round of 76 but demonstrated his enduring class with a 3-under 67 to get back to 3-over for the tournament, just six shots back entering the weekend in a tie for 13th.\n\nDay's round, which began at the 10th hole, was ignited by a terrific eagle at his third hole \u2014 the gigantic par-five 12th that measures 647 yards.\n\nHe struck his approach from 323 yards to 20 feet from the hole and sank the eagle putt. Two birdies quickly followed in the next five holes.\n\nHis biggest disappointment as he looked set to finish with a 66 after two more birdies on the homeward nine, was his wayward drive at the ninth that led to an anti-climactic final bogey.\n\nBurns, who shot a final-round 62 on Sunday at the Canadian Open before losing in a play-off, also started his second round on the back nine and birdied 11, 13, 17 and 18.\n\nHe responded to his lone bogey at the first hole by putting his approach at the next hole to about six feet.\n\nAmerican world number one Scottie Scheffler had five bogeys and four birdies in his 71 to be left at 4-over, alongside countryman Collin Morikawa (71) and fellow dual major winner Jon Rahm, who exploded after shooting a 75.\n\nThe second-round spoiler left the superstar Spaniard seven shots adrift of Burns.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm too annoyed and too mad right now to think about any perspective,\" Rahm said.\n\n\"Very few rounds of golf I played in my life where I think I hit good putts and they didn't sniff the hole, so it's frustrating.\"\n\nMasters champion Rory McIlroy birdied the last hole in a round of 72 to be 6-over and just inside the cut line.\n\nAustralian Marc Leishman, who had begun promisingly with a 71, suffered in his second round with a 75 that included a double-bogey six at the ninth hole to also hover at 6-over.\n\nA day after Patrick Reed recorded the fourth albatross in US Open annals, Frenchman Victor Perez made a hole-in-one at the par-three sixth, the second ever ace during a US Open at Oakmont.\n\nFive-time major winner Brooks Koepka, one of 14 LIV Golf players in the field, started his day two shots off the pace but dropped back after a 74 that featured eight bogeys.\n\nAfter out-duelling McIlroy down the stretch to reign last year at Pinehurst, DeChambeau won't feature on the weekend after slumping to 10-over with a second-round 77.\n\nAt nine over following rounds of 77 and 72, Australian Min Woo Lee was also sent packing, along with dual major winner Justin Thomas, 2016 Oakmont champion Dustin Johnson, fellow former world number one Justin Rose, LIV Golf dominator Joaquin Niemann and Swedish sensation Ludvig Aberg.\n\nIncredibly, Johnson and Niemann were among some 60 players to finish at 10-over or worse, with American George Duangmanee racking up a +35 total with horror rounds of 86 and 89.\n\nAAP with agencies",

    "text": "Thinking of taking a trip to the snow this winter, but the cost of staying in a resort town and hitting the slopes is giving you chills?\n\nYou're not alone.\n\nHere's how others have found ways to enjoy holidaying in the Australian Alps on a budget.\n\n'It's a bucket-list item'\n\nHigh school mates Dylan Oakroot and Alex Marychurch sit under the pull-out awning of their SUV in a free campground and watch the rain pour down.\n\nEvery so often, one of the pair stands up to push the growing pool of water off their canvas roof.\n\nThere's a pool forming, too, in the corner of the barbecue, where some of the cheapest sausages the boys could buy are slowly cooking in the rain.\n\nAlex Marychurch braves the rain to cook some steak and sausages for a cheap meal. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nIt's snow season 2024, and what some might consider a dour situation is one of pure joy for the 23-year-olds from Brisbane.\n\nThey knew doing it on the cheap was the only way they were ever going to fulfil their dream of visiting the snow.\n\n\"It's our first time seeing snow. We've been dreaming about it for a long time. It's a bucket-list item,\" Mr Oakroot said.\n\n\" We're trying to do it cheap, but it's bloody expensive. \"\n\nVisitors say some costs, such as day and lift passes, cannot be avoided. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nThe boys will miss the 2025 winter season because of life circumstances, but Mr Oakroot said they would \"definitely\" make the trip again.\n\n\"We plan to return next year, and maybe with some more people too,\" he said.\n\nSnow sports, and even just a day trip to see the snow up close, are becoming too expensive for many people.\n\nMr Oakshot and Mr Marychurch are staying in a campground near Jindabyne, in the Snowy Mountains, rated one of the least-affordable towns in Australia in the 2023 Rental Affordability Index.\n\nHouse prices here have risen almost 150 per cent over five years, with locals being priced out of the town they grew up in as homes are transformed into short-term rentals.\n\nJindabyne was rated the least affordable town in Australia in the 2023 Rental Affordability Index. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nThe population of around 5,000 quadruples to more than 20,000 during peak snow season as tourists head to the ski fields of Perisher, Thredbo and Charlotte Pass, which are all just a 30-minute drive away.\n\nEvery night in winter, Jindabyne is lit up with fluorescent lights, as almost every store selling food or renting snow gear desperately tries to capitalise on the tourist boom.\n\nMost stores in Jindabyne's CBD rely on winter tourism dollars. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nBut most evenings, ravenous crowds descend on the only major supermarket in town, eager to feed themselves as cheaply as possible.\n\nAnd during the day, when one Instagrammer reported that a hot chocolate on the slopes can cost up to $17, many budget-conscious holiday-makers resort to bringing a packed lunch.\n\n'A better experience'\n\nOne of the biggest expenses for Mr Oakroot and Mr Marychurch was the cost of fuel to get them from Brisbane to Jindabyne.\n\nBut, Mr Oakroot said, some costs were unavoidable.\n\n\"The most expensive part was the lift passes. They charge an arm and a leg for a lift pass, but it's worth it,\" he said.\n\nDay passes to go skiing in Australia start from about $150, with membership deals pushing tourists to spend more on a seasonal pass.\n\nMates Dylan Oakroot and Alex Marychurch hope to return to the snow next year. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nThe mates are curbing costs by sleeping in a swag and a rooftop tent, eating a diet of sausages, eggs, cheese, bread and cheap steaks cooked in the drizzle, and relying on lighting a fire or simply rugging up to stay warm.\n\n\"Doing it as cheaply as possible adds to the experience,\" Mr Oakroot said.\n\n\"You've got more challenges you've got to overcome. You make more memories. It's a lot better.\"\n\n'No other way to save'\n\nAt another Snowy Mountains campsite, Wollongong's Judy Chang is playing with her young daughter, Skye, outside their teepee tent.\n\n\"Accommodation is so expensive, so we decided to invest in a tent,\" she said.\n\nJudy Chang says camping is the only way she can fulfil her dream of annual family snow trips. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\n\"There's not really any other way to save money. You have to pay for a lift pass, so this is how we're doing it.\"\n\nMs Chang was able to keep some costs down by raiding second-hand markets and op-shops, managing to pick up a second-hand ski jacket and snowboard for Skye.\n\n\"They grow so quickly, and the second-hand market offers pretty new things,\" she said.\n\nJudy Chang bought two-year-old Skye a second-hand snowboard. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nMs Chang also recommended purchasing a two-year car pass from National Parks because it was cheaper in the long run than the annual alternative.\n\nHer dream of having a yearly family snow trip was only feasible by cutting costs as much as possible, she said.\n\n\"It's hard. Not everyone is into camping, and winter camping is tough, but it is super nice,\" she said.\n\n\" Everyone should at least give it a try. \"\n\nJudy Chang says camping with a toddler isn't easy, but it makes a snow trip affordable. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\n'Tourism is what it is'\n\nBut tension is brewing in the town.\n\nMany locals are frustrated by the growing trend of BYO food and accommodation, with local cafes and traders feeling they're missing out on tourism dollars as visitors cut costs.\n\nComments on the local Facebook noticeboard criticise visitors to the region who don't give back \u2014 those who don't buy a ski pass at the resorts, who bring their own lunch, who take up valuable car parks without spending in local shops.\n\n\"80 per cent of the non-skiiers [sic] come up with a slow cooker full of rice and don't spend a penny on the resort or other food outlets up there. Sooner or later those businesses are going to go belly up,\" one comment says.\n\n\"They need to stop all [visitors] taking a packed lunch up there in a full van taking a parking spot away from skiers whilst contributing nothing but park entry to the economy. Ban snow play and toboggans,\" another said.\n\nHowever, Jindabyne Chamber of Commerce president Olivier Kapetanakos said tourists trying to visit the snow cheaply was nothing new and was often a way for people to try out the snow before committing to a more expensive visit in the future.\n\nHe said many such tourists returned in future years or even moved to the area long term.\n\n\"Tourism is what it is,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to take them as they are.\n\n\" We must help the first-time snow tourist have a good time so they will feel comfortable to return. \"\n\nMr Kapetanakos said local businesses had learnt that three-or-so months of tourism could not sustain a year-round income and many had pivoted to new markets, such as hiking and mountain-biking.\n\nContributing to the town\n\nFor Matt Boggas from the Sunshine Coast, a trip to the snow looks like snowboarding during the day, then sleeping in his car at night, cooking his own food, waking himself up with a swim in Jindabyne Lake, and trying not to drink too much.\n\nMatt Boggas returns to the Snowy Mountains every year. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nAnd if he didn't sleep in his car?\n\n\"It would be ridiculous. It would be a lot of money \u2013 definitely unaffordable for most people our age [25],\" he said.\n\n\" Even going and getting a beer here is crazy. \"\n\nThe local brewery sells 300mL beers from $9, while many choose to purchase alcohol to be consumed at home.\n\nBWS Jindabyne is the liquor store chain's top-performing store nationally during the winter months.\n\nMatt Boggas sleeps in his car and eats cheaply so he can enjoy the snowfields every year. (ABC News: Jack Fisher)\n\nWhen he's not on the slopes, Mr Boggas is dropping in at the local skate-bowl, just off the main street, which becomes a magnet for would-be snowboarders after the lifts have closed for the day, or in bad weather.\n\nAs young people carve around on scooters and skateboards with music pumping, Mr Boggas says these people \u2014 many friends of his from the Sunshine Coast who make the pilgrimage to the snow annually \u2014 contribute something to the snow experience.\n\nIt's what he comes back for each year.\n\n\"The cost makes it super inaccessible. It sucks,\" he said.",

    "text": "Former Australian of the Year Richard Scolyer has completed his 250th Parkrun \u2014 a milestone he set after he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2023.\n\nThe renowned melanoma researcher was among hundreds of runners who took part in the Greenway Parkrun at Haberfield in Sydney's inner west on Saturday morning.\n\nProfessor Scolyer, who put himself forward as \"patient zero\" for revolutionary brain cancer treatment, crossed the finish line to applause and cheers from the crowd.\n\nShortly after he finished the race, light rain began to fall and a rainbow formed over the reserve.\n\nA number of media turned up to the event, he told them that 250 Parkruns was a \"big goal\" he set for himself.\n\nA rainbow formed after Richard Scolyer finished his run. (ABC News: Luke Royes)\n\n\"I did a lot of Parkruns in the early 2000s but then as the kids go through various parts of their life you stop doing it,\" he said.\n\n\"And then when I got sick again I wanted to try and get to 250.\n\n\" I guess it's part of my personality. Bit embarrassing, but wanting to get to 250 was something that pushed me along. \"\n\nProfessor Scolyer said it was \"crazy\" to see such a huge turnout at the run and that he was \"very happy\" to complete his goal.\n\n'I never thought I'd get there'\n\nProfessor Scolyer said he had doubts about whether he would reach the major milestone.\n\n\"To be honest, I never thought I'd get there,\" he said.\n\nThe cancer researcher participated in the run at Richard Murden Reserve on Saturday. (ABC News: Luke Royes)\n\nIn a post to his more than 20,000 followers on X earlier this week, he wrote that it was a goal \"I wasn't sure I'd reach\" and that he was excited to be able to take part in the run.\n\n\"So it's with a huge amount of gratitude to my family, friends, and medical team that I'll be celebrating this achievement,\" he said.\n\n\" Thanks to everyone who's been cheering me on. \"\n\nThe post on social media came after a long period of no updates, which Professor Scolyer said was due to the impact of his latest round of cancer treatment, but that he now felt \"like the fog has lifted a bit\".\n\nProfessor Scolyer was diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma in 2023 and was given just six to eight months to live.\n\nBut an experimental immunotherapy treatment he was given managed to keep the cancer at bay for almost two years with no recurrence.\n\nRichard Scolyer's treatment defied expectations by keeping his brain cancer at bay for 22 months. (Twitter: @ProfRAScolyer)\n\nHowever, he revealed in March that after undergoing scans, he had received the heartbreaking news that his brain cancer had come back.\n\nIn May, he had another setback, revealing that his first proper scan since the surgery showed the glioblastoma had progressed and it was getting \"harder to treat\".\n\n'I'm still here so I'm pretty pleased about that'\n\nHe told ABC News Breakfast last month he wasn't sure how much time he had left.\n\n\"I'm still here and still able to chat to you so I'm pretty pleased about that,\" he said. \"Who knows how long I've got. Could be months, could be less.\"\n\nProfessor Scolyer said he's focused on spending the time he has left doing the things he loves most.\n\n\"I love my life. I love the interactions I have with so many people.\n\nRichard Scolyer was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2023. (Supplied: Instagram/@profrscolyer)\n\n\"I guess in reality, I have focused down on the things that I like doing. Spending more time with my family is number one, but also contributing to society. It's something I've done for a long, long time.\n\n\"I've been a specialist for more than 25 years now. So a lot of things that I've done I don't want to give up just like that.\"\n\nProfessor Scolyer has been very public and honest about his prognosis and journey through brain cancer treatment in interviews, social media and in his recent memoir, Brainstorm.\n\nHis memoir, which was co-written with Garry Maddox, won the Social Impact Book of the Year at the Australian Book Industry Awards in Melbourne last month.",

(ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nTheir stories echo the experience of many boys whose lives were changed by the Big Brother Movement.\n\nKnown now as BBM, the organisation is celebrating its centenary this year with reunions in most states of Australia.\n\nThe thinning ranks of men once known as Little Brothers have been gathering to reminisce.\n\n\"It's lovely to honour the old men now. Just to see their faces and for them to connect with other people. Some people haven't seen each other for years,\" BBM CEO Suellen McCaffrey said.\n\nAs the movement turns 100, Suellen McCaffrey says it continues to help young Australians build their future. (Supplied)\n\n\"Not so many organisations get to 100 years old so it's so important to recognise the journeys and honour the journeys these men have made,\" she said.\n\nGenerations linked by the same journey\n\nThe NSW reunion was held at Calmsley Hill, near Parramatta, the former training farm where new arrivals had a basic course in farming before being assigned to rural properties.\n\nAmong those in attendance was 93-year-old Jim Reardon, who arrived from Liverpool in 1949.\n\nDecades after arriving in Australia, former Little Brothers gather with their families to celebrate. (Supplied)\n\nHe recalled the initial years as \"torrid\".\n\n\"I used to live in little tin hut, hot in the summer, freezing in the winter. Cutting down trees, it was hard graft,\" Mr Reardon said.\n\n\" Twelve hours a day, seven days a week. \"\n\nBy the late 1950s, new Big Brother arrivals had shifted. They were typically older, in their 20s, and seeking city work rather than farming.\n\nLittle Brother migrants were taught farm skills such as how to ride a horse. (Supplied)\n\nThe sponsorship scheme ended following changes to the migration rules in 1983.\n\nAustralian immigration policy became more multicultural and the scheme was seen to favour only Britons.\n\nThe training farm in western Sydney was sold, and the proceeds reinvested, and the organisation evolved into BBM Youth Support.\n\nIt sponsors young Australians to travel overseas to further their careers, many focused on rural development.\n\nThe Big Brother scheme had a profound role in the development of the Australian nation.\n\nA century later, numbers tell the story\n\nThe organisation estimates there are now almost 100,000 descendants of the Little Brothers.\n\n\"The Big Brother Movement allowed my father and my family so many opportunities.

(ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nFor many spectators who have driven in from Darwin and nearby towns, the Noonamah Rodeo is an exaggerated spectacle of rural life.\n\nA road train cab perched above the arena spews flames at various intervals.\n\nThere's a half-time freestyle motocross show, and the live country music playing will continue until the early hours of the morning.\n\nA road train cab and big screen fit out the rodeo arena. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nThe arena is next to the Noonamah Tavern, in Darwin's rural area. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nFor urban visitors, it's a rare chance to pull on the RMs and a Ringers Western work shirt or to flaunt a slightly more polished cowboy-core 'fit inspired by celebrities like Orville Peck or Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nBut for others, it is serious business.\n\nCowboys waiting in the stalls for the next event. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nBackstage, dozens of young men in sturdy boots, well-worn jeans and wide-brimmed hats are standing, talking among themselves.\n\nIt seems most of them know each other from the rodeo circuit, and they aren't afraid to call themselves \"cowboys\".\n\nCowboys come from all over the Top End to compete at the Noonamah Rodeo. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nOne of them is UK-born Jack Milsom.\n\nJust a year ago, at 25, he left his small home town in the Adelaide Hills seeking a life on a remote Top End cattle station, with no idea what to expect.\n\nOne year on, he's buckling up a pair of tasselled leather chaps in the shadow of this rodeo arena by a roadside pub.\n\nJack Milsom says station life has always appealed to him. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nJack says he's always been drawn to the idea of life on the land, and so one day, with \"literally only directions, not knowing how the pay was or what I was doing\" he got in the car and drove 3,200 kilometres north.\n\n\"Looking at stations and what not, I thought 'that lifestyle is for me', and took the jump,\" he says, in his blended British-Australian accent.\n\n\"I thought, bugger it, you only live once.\n\n\"It's just so free. You get to work on the land every day, the boss is cruisy, you get to go back to the workshop at the end of every day.\n\n\"Everyone has a beer, a yarn, and rinse, wash, repeat.\"\n\nJack Milsom has embraced the cowboy lifestyle since he \"took the jump\" to work on a Top End station about a year ago. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nFor the men and women who work on remote Top End cattle stations \u2014 part of a community of workers often based hundreds of kilometres from each other \u2014 events like this one are important.\n\nAs well as a rare chance to socialise, they are an opportunity to compete in that celebrated event of cowboy culture, the rodeo.\n\nWomen typically compete in barrel racing, while the men ride bulls.\n\nA rodeo rider and his bull bolt into the arena. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nWhen he's not riding unruly livestock for a crowd of thousands, Jack is driving heavy machinery at Old Mount Bundy Station, near Jabiru, where he lives and works.\n\nHe is quick to clarify that station life is not easy, but affords an undeniable sense of freedom.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, the work's hard and you do long hours, but it's very rewarding work,\" he says.\n\nA bull rider hangs on during a rodeo event.

(ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nNearby, other competitors are tying and tightening various intricate knots in the bull-ropes which will bind them to the huge animals they'll be riding in just minutes.\n\nCowboys rely on ropes like these to secure them to the bulls they ride at the rodeo. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nA cowboy preparing for an event. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nIt's a struggle to spot anyone not wearing a wide-brimmed hat of one variety or another.\n\nNot many look like the felt type you might associate with The Man from Snowy River. Instead, most Top End cowboys and cowgirls prefer hats made of thatched straw.\n\nThe wide-brimmed hats worn by Top End cowboys are about utility as well as style. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\n\"Wide-brimmed hats, they go back a long way for cattlemen. It's what drovers wore,\" Jack explains.\n\n\"You see cattlemen with bigger brims and felt hats, that's actually a tool when you're out working with cattle on horseback.\n\n\"You use the top of your hat. You flip it upside-down and give your horse a drink, and also it keeps you safe from the sun.\"\n\nCowboys at the rodeo say Top End station work is hard but rewarding. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nA cowboy herding rodeo bulls ahead of an event. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nAs well as a good hat, Jack says durable denim is essential for a cowboy, because when \"you're playing with cattle in the yard, you get hooked, they [your jeans] get ripped\".\n\nAnd while a big belt buckle might seem like a cowboy staple, it's not something just anyone can wear.\n\n\"You do see a lot of people trying to act like they've got a buckle and stuff but, see, some of the cowboys around here, they've actually earned it, they've done the hard yards,\" Jack says.\n\nThis belt buckle recognises a rodeo championship win. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nChampion bull rider Sam Woodall has competed in the United States and Brazil. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nThe moral code of the cowboy\n\nMost rodeo spectators from Darwin and surrounds are wearing what New South Wales competitor Dean Wallace sees as a less authentic interpretation of cowboy western wear.\n\nWhile many spectators will stay at the arena into the early hours of the morning for an after-party, Dean says most of his fellow competitors will \"go back to their utes for a sleep\" or a quiet beer.\n\nDean Wallace says there's much more to being a cowboy than the clothes. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\n\"I think the ones that highlight a bad view of cowboy culture are the ones that dress up for tonight, get on the piss, try to fight someone and get carried out,\" he says.\n\n\"You see some people who dress up just for tonight and they've never actually seen a paddock, stepped in s*** or touched a sheep.\"\n\nA bull in a stall bordering the rodeo arena. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nDean isn't keen on the suggestion cowboys are proud of their differences from \"city slickers\", and says rather than being concerned about their identity, most cowboys just don't care.\n\n\"There are moral standards for a cowboy, and you shouldn't have to think about what those are,\" he declares.\n\nBut he explains that the cowboy identity can't simply be adopted by anyone.\n\nCowboys have a culture all their own. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\n\"It's just being tough enough to handle whatever gets thrown at you, brave enough to do whatever you have to do and looking after those around you. I guess that's my view of a cowboy,\" he says.\n\nWhile Dean says the cowboy identity usually comes with growing up in a pastoral family, he believes it is not impossible to become one \u2014 but it takes hard work.\n\nDean Wallace says it takes a certain toughness to be a cowboy. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\n\"I'm all for anyone that wants to get into it,\" he says.\n\n\"If you put your hat on, put your boots on and you're willing to work for it, that's all there is to it.\n\n\"I'm telling you, if you go from a lifestyle where you're not used to it and you try to get into it, you'll quickly figure if you're a cowboy or not.\"\n\nAs the final bull is taken back to the yards and the night-time entertainment starts warming up, as if on cue, Dean and his fellow bull riders begin to pack up and head to their utes, leaving the crowd of partygoers behind them in the settling dust.",

(ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nAfter losing his job in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and unsure when it would end, Thomson set his sights on a long-term project.\n\n\"A tip I got about podcasts was that you need to find something that's repeatable, so I was thinking of doing something relating to migrants and cultural diversity,\" he said.\n\n\" It popped into my head, 'has anyone tried to interview one person from all these nationalities?' and it occurred that might be an interesting way to delve into those kinds of stories in an original way. \"\n\nThe Tasmanian government's Multicultural Access Point (MAP) listed 177 nations as being represented on the island, and so began Thomson's journey.\n\nIt started as a podcast \u2014 177 Nations of Tasmania \u2014 but now incorporates Mr Wilson's portraits in an exhibition currently on display in the State Library in Hobart.\n\nHe's captured some amazing stories, such as Nick Anagnostis', whose parents put him on a boat by himself from Lesbos, Greece, aged just 15 years old, to escape civil unrest.\n\nA portrait of Nick Anagnostis taken for the 177 Nations project.

(Picture: Andrew Wilson)\n\nBut the story that stayed with Thomson most was hearing about her Jewish friend's father, who she saw taken away by German soldiers when she was just a child.\n\n\"It really stuck with me, and it makes you realise that those personal stories can actually be so powerful, more powerful than if you could have told me about the history of Jews in Europe at the time,\" he said.\n\n\" It makes you realise that there are people in our community that have really experienced some really major historical events which have driven them here. \"\n\nThe 177 Nations exhibition is currently on display at the state library in Hobart. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nFor Thomson, finding all 177 nationalities was more about having a target than achieving the goal.\n\nHowever, he's slowly getting closer, with 115 nationalities represented in the project so far.\n\n\"I've got to the stage where it's actually seeming a bit more realistic. I didn't expect to get to 115, so I think, 'well, why not?'\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully having this public exhibition will give it a bit more momentum and a few more people will approach me.\n\n\" But realistically, a lot of those remaining ones, there's just going to be one or two people so there's going to be a bit of luck and patience involved. \"\n\nHighlighting diversity\n\nAndrew Wilson was recruited to take portraits of the people who were interviewed, to expand the scope of the project.

    "text": "Female footballers in a north-west Victorian league have boycotted a major event in protest of their club's handling of a sexual assault allegation.\n\nThe Millewa Centenary Day on June 7 at Lake Cullulleraine drew a crowd of hundreds from across the region..\n\nBut notably absent from the football and netball showcase were the majority of the Werrimull Football Netball Club's women's football team, who refused to play.\n\nWerrimull's Jemma Jo Johnson is calling for more action to be taken by clubs to protect their players. (Supplied: Jemma Johnson)\n\nWerrimull FNC player Jemma Jo Johnson, who uses the pronouns they/them, said the boycott was a response to the club's decision not to suspend a male player under investigation by AFL Victoria following a sexual assault allegation.\n\nJohnson said eight women from the Magpies squad had chosen to quit playing for the club as a result.\n\n\"Our safe place has been absolutely just stripped from us,\" they said.\n\n\"It is time \u2014 they [Werrimull Football Netball Club] really have a chance to not just protect us and look after us, but show the rest of the league that the people in power aren't going to allow the females to feel unsafe.\"\n\nThe ABC understands the allegation was reported to the club and AFL Victoria but not to police.\n\nWerrimull Football Netball Club president Dale Ramsey confirmed AFL Victoria was investigating an incident.\n\nIn a statement, the club said it was \"deeply concerned and saddened by recent allegations\".\n\n\"We take these allegations extremely seriously and are committed to fostering a safe, respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for all players, members and supporters \u2014 both on and off the field,\" the statement said.\n\nLack of guidelines\n\nThe protest has highlighted what University of Canberra sport integrity and ethics associate professor Catherine Ordway said was a grey area for AFL clubs.\n\nCatherine Ordway says clubs must decide in advance what to do if a player faces serious allegations. (ABC News: Donal Sheil)\n\nShe said each club should decide in advance what to do in the event of a player facing serious allegations.\n\n\"It's always better, in the calm time when there hasn't been an incident, to sit down and say 'What do we stand for as a club?'\" Dr Ordway said.\n\n\"If we care about keeping women and girls safe, if we care about keeping young people safe, then let's have some rules and some guidelines so that if this comes up in future then we know how to act.\"\n\nShe said a one-size-fits-all rule was difficult to implement.\n\n\"There are always going to be hard cases where a blanket rule would be completely inappropriate and unfair because it might depend on the age of the [people] involved,\" Dr Ordway said.\n\nThe ABC understands Werrimull FNC does not have specific guidelines relating to players under active AFL integrity or police investigations.\n\n'Not just our club'\n\nJohnson said the club had lost key members due to the way it had handled the case.\n\nWerrimull footballer Jemma Jo Johnson is dismayed \"that one person is prioritised over a whole team\". (Supplied: Barb Kelly)\n\n\"We've actually lost a couple of really, really valuable and much-loved people in our club,\" they said.\n\n\"That's the part that we feel the most heartbroken about, I think, is that one person is prioritised over a whole team that has put nothing but love and energy into the club.\n\n\"There is a bigger issue here across the league, not just in our club.\"\n\nIn a statement sent out to clubs across north-west Victoria, Millewa Football Netball League (MFNL) chairperson Emily Harlock-Knights said the league \"unequivocally condemns any form of behaviour that is abusive, disrespectful, or unbecoming \u2014 whether on or off the field\".\n\nBut she said the league and clubs were not equipped to investigate serious incidents.\n\n\"It is not the role of the MFNL or our clubs to act as judge, jury, or executioner,\" Ms Harlock-Knights said.\n\n\" We strongly encourage anyone who experiences or witnesses this type of behaviour to report it to Victoria Police or relevant authorities who are properly equipped to investigate and manage these incidents in a lawful and fair manner. \"\n\nAFL Victoria has been contacted for comment.",

(Source: Getty Images)\n\nSome are still re-building after years living in caravans on their land, without even basic facilities like a flushing toilet.\n\nThe findings of an inquiry into the fire by the ACT's Chief Coroner Lorraine Walker brought down yesterday included an apology.\n\n\"This matter has taken far too long to be finalised,\" Chief Coroner Walker said.\n\n\"I offer my apologies to those affected by the fire and its aftermath.\"\n\nIt was the first time the hardship suffered by the residents had been officially acknowledged.\n\nFire started by Defence helicopter\n\nThe Orroral Valley fire burned for five weeks, destroying 80 per cent of the ACT's Namadgi National Park. (Supplied: Department of Defence)\n\nThis bushfire was no act of nature, it was started by an army helicopter across the border in the ACT.\n\nIt's now well known the aircraft made an unplanned toilet stop on a hill in the Namadgi National Park at the head of the Orroral Valley.\n\nA hot searchlight underneath the helicopter ignited the dry grass, and the pilot hastily took off.\n\nThe crew said they were focused on safety because they thought the helicopter was damaged.\n\nIt would be at least 35 minutes after the fire started before Defence told the local firefighting authorities of the exact location of the blaze.\n\nThe focus of the inquiry was what happened in those minutes.\n\nThere had been other calls for an inquiry into the fire.\n\nThe fire threatened Canberra's southern suburbs as it burned for five weeks. (Supplied: Jacob Ross)\n\nIt not only caused serious damage to Bumbalong, it also burned through 80 per cent of Namadgi National Park, and even threatened Canberra's southern suburbs, as it burned for five weeks.\n\nAt the time, Chief Minister Andrew Barr said he didn't want a \"witch hunt\", so the ACT's Chief Coroner set up her own inquiry.\n\nIn the end, yesterday's findings were mild.\n\nShe found there had been an \"error of judgement\", finding also it was not plausible that none of the crew thought to tell local authorities about the fire immediately.\n\nBut there was still great value in the inquiry.\n\nInquiry facilitated transparency\n\nThe fire began when the helicopter landed for a break and its searchlight ignited the grass. (Supplied: Department of Defence)\n\nThe identities of the crew were suppressed, but they were compelled to give evidence.\n\nThis produced a clear picture of how the events unfolded, including the conversations between the crew members which were recorded and played to the court.\n\nThe inquiry facilitated a transparency that hadn't been there before.\n\nBefore that, events had come to light slowly after questions from the ABC, revealing the helicopter crew never called in the fire during its flight back to Canberra Airport.\n\nThis photograph was taken from the Defence helicopter that began the Orroral Valley fire, just moments after it was accidentally set. (Supplied: Department of Defence)\n\nLater, pictures taken by the crew emerged.\n\nThe inquiry also revealed details, including that it was more than nine hours before the Emergency Services Agency Commissioner Georgina Whelan was told a Defence chopper was the cause of the fire.\n\nInterestingly the Chief Coroner found the delay in reporting the fire had little impact on the response by local authorities.\n\nThe smoke had already been spotted from a fire tower within minutes, and firefighters called in.\n\nIn her finding Chief Coroner Lorraine Walker said reporting the fire earlier would have been beneficial. (ABC News: Tamara Penniket)\n\nBut as Chief Coroner Walker said, reporting the fire earlier would have been beneficial.\n\n\"Failure to report the fire earlier, and failure of the Commonwealth to accept the overarching need to do so, does raise an issue of public safety,\" Chief Coroner Walker said.\n\nThe Bumbalong residents were relieved to hear the Coroner's findings, saying at least someone has been found responsible.\n\nThey are hoping the findings will help in their next round, a battle in the Civil courts with the Commonwealth over compensation for their losses.",

Two Olympics is very good, three is exceptional.\n\nThe class of 2021 from the Tokyo Games are now some of Australia's all-time greats: Kaylee McKeown, Ariarne Titmus, Mollie O'Callaghan, Zac Stubblety-Cook.\n\nComing out of Paris, the quartet and their contemporaries are older and somewhat wiser.\n\nSome, like Titmus, are taking a year off, while those swimming on are working out what it is exactly they want from the sport.\n\nMcKeown off to world titles despite DQ Photo shows An Australian swimmer arches her back as she dives into the water in a backstroke race. Kaylee McKeown beat rival Mollie O'Callaghan in the race of the night at the Australian Swimming Trials, but she acknowledges she is still not at her best after struggling since the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe instinctive, youthful and very fast swimmers of Tokyo have grown up in front of our eyes and even though they're only in their early to mid-20s, they've taken on some of the baggage that comes with age: doubts and questions creep in.\n\nStubblety-Cook won gold in the men's 200m breaststroke in Tokyo, he won a World Championship and set a world record before following it up with silver in Paris.\n\n\"The last eight years have very much been [as a] younger athlete, really hungry and really one after the other,\" Stubblety-Cook said.\n\n\"Last year I had a lot of time off, and a lot of time to reflect and see where I was at, and make sure I really wanted to commit to the next four years.\n\n\"The way Mel (Marshall, his coach) put it to me the other day, it was like you go from being capable but mentally not knowing how you did it, and then you swap over at some point and all of a sudden you realise, 'Oh, shit, how do I do this?'\" he said.\n\nStubblety-Cook has another chance at a World Championship in Singapore next month after winning the 200m breaststroke at the Australian Selection Trials in Adelaide.\n\n\"Mel and I both believe my best time is still in me, so I'm still chasing that, and I think that's the goal over the next three years, and just to get better and better each year.\"\n\nHe said he was excited at the prospect of swimming at the World Championships.\n\n\"Everyone's keeping their cards close to their chests, and I know a lot of people have a lot of time off and down time,\" Stubblety-Cook said.\n\n\"I actually think it will come down to a race, I don't think it will be all that fast,\" he said.\n\nLike so many of the Paris veterans, Stubblety-Cook said he'd had a sharp comedown after the Games.\n\n\"I mean the 'Olympic Blues' is always like something to be mindful of, I think people underestimate, especially first time, what it is.\n\nParalympic veteran Rohan Crothers said he still suffers from the post-Paralympic comedown despite competing at the top level for over a decade.\n\n\"You spend your entire life training and preparing for this one competition and then it's over in thirty seconds, or over in a minute,\" Crothers said.\n\n\"And you get back home and everyone's happy to see you and they all support you, but then two weeks later, life goes on and that can be really difficult to cope with as an athlete.\n\n\"But I think one of the great things about sport is that it's not just about the competition, it is also the community,\" Crothers said.\n\nO'Callaghan opens up on the insular life of elite swimmers Photo shows Female swimmer restingon lane ropes after winning a race, goggles on forehead, looking at timing screen Mollie O'Callaghan has won the women's 200m freestyle at the Australian Swimming Trials, but was disappointed to be well off her personal best time.\n\nMollie O'Callaghan has five Olympic gold medals at just 21.

You can't predict sickness. You can't predict any of that.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nCrothers said he was still motivated to continue swimming for the greater good as well as personal success.\n\n\"Why I swim, why I still compete is for that little two minute golden window after a race where I get a platform and an opportunity to inspire young kids with a disability to get involved with the community, get involved with sport,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think I was going to be anyone or achieve anything in my life until I saw another swimmer race for about two-and-a-half minutes at the Beijing Paralympics.\n\n\"And that has literally changed my entire life \u2014 it's given me so many incredible opportunities.\n\n\"So, although it's a small moment for me as an athlete, I place so much value and absolutely treasure the impact that my sporting achievements and my sporting ability can have on Australia and the world-wide community,\" Crothers said.",

    "text": "The troubled and sometimes estranged daughter of the musical genius Brian Wilson famously described her young life waking each morning to the same song being played by her father at full volume. Every single day.\n\nCarnie Wilson, herself an accomplished musician, said she would wake to the first heartbeat-like thumps of the song echoing through the house: DUM. Da-da da DUM. A familiar wall of sound would roll through the drumbeat, then the percussion would hit, and then the yearning lyrics to the Ronettes' smash hit, Be My Baby, would soar once again.\n\nThe night we met I knew I/needed you so\n\nBrian Wilson, the founder of the Beach Boys, often described the 1963 classic as the greatest song he knew. \"I felt like I wanted to try to do something as good as that record, and I never did. I've never stopped trying. It's the greatest record ever produced, no doubt.\"\n\nBrian Wilson, visionary behind the Beach Boys, dies aged 82 Photo shows A man in a pink shirt smiling Brian Wilson, the visionary and fragile leader of the Beach Boys and one of the world's most influential recording artists, has died aged 82.\n\nListening to one great musician stand in awe of another's piece of music, sounding humble and joyous just like any other fan, is a wonderfully intimate thing. When you realise that Bruce Springsteen or Florence Welch are buying the same records you buy and are also standing in their living room with the volume up wondering, how do they do that, you understand how connected you all are as music fans. How you all attend the same church and sing the same hymns.\n\nIt is a remarkable leveller when a great musician declares themselves simply another fan. Brian Wilson's enduring love of that gorgeous piece of pop makes him a kid singing at the top of his voice in the car, just like us.\n\nThe best kind of musical rivalry\n\nIn the wake of Brian Wilson's death this week at the age of 82, generations of musicians have spoken about how much they loved his songs too, about how meaningful they have been in their lives as fans and musicians, and there is one song in particular that they keep coming back to.\n\nShall I try to list them all, the artists who say that the Beach Boys, the album Pet Sounds, and that one song have been some of the most important songs in their lives? Patti Smith, Bruno Mars, Iggy Pop, Elton John, Paul Simon, Janelle Monae, Carole King, Leonard Bernstein, Smokey Robinson, the Gibb brothers, The Eagles\u2026 I'll have to stop there, but will finish of course with John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were unabashed fans.\n\nThe two bands inspired each other and competed with each other in their early days. The Beatles' Rubber Soul spurred Brian to write Pet Sounds, which in turn sparked Sergeant Peppers: the best kind of rivalry when fans get the benefits.\n\nBrian Wilson was not only a legendary musician but a fan of The Ronettes, calling their song Be My Baby the greatest ever produced. (Reuters: Lucas Jackson )\n\nBut what of this one song \u2014 the one song that all these musicians and others reference when they say it's one of the greatest ever written?\n\nThe night Brian died, the singer-songwriter Sting was on tour in Germany, and this is how he commemorated him.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThe simple purity of God Only Knows, and the glorious harmonies of its recorded version have become a touchstone of modern music, and a shared password of musical passion: if someone you like likes this song too, then you're going to be just fine.\n\nPaul McCartney wrote on Instagram this week: \"Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special. The notes he heard in his head and passed to us were simple and brilliant at the same time.\"\n\nPlaying their songs to keep them close\n\nI've written before about how our most beloved musicians close a door on our early, formative lives as music fans when they die. We get to keep their music, but our connection to that thrilled, younger self gets ever more distant, and they seem to take an understanding of us with them. They have the secret of us because of our love for them.\n\nFor many this week Brian was that idol, and I know when another goes, we all privately review the list of those who remain and dread the inevitable news of their loss one day.\n\nI've checked my list. For now, they are all here, although so many are missing. But I can still play their songs to keep them close.\n\nThis weekend, read about the Melbourne eccentric who kept the people and faces of his city alive with a photo booth that nobody thought was anything more than an amusement. The persistence of memory, again.\n\nHave a safe and happy weekend, and here is just a handful of great artists who revere that Brian Wilson song, all in perfect harmony, to celebrate the BBC's enduring love of music, just like ours. Go well.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nVirginia Trioli is presenter of Creative Types and a former co-host of ABC News Breakfast and Mornings on ABC Radio Melbourne.",

(Supplied)\n\nBut two years ago came the devastating news the cancer had returned, and spread to her brain as a metastatic cancer.\n\nShe is one of the youngest victims in Queensland living \"with\" the disease rather than dying from it.\n\nForgotten statistics\n\nMs Erzitech is one of nearly 4,000 people now formally identified as living with metastatic breast cancer thanks to a program for national reform spearheaded by Breast Cancer Network Australia and Cancer Alliance Queensland.\n\nHer journey has been brutal \u2014 she says the drugs she has been on have caused terrible side effects.\n\nMs Erzitech says managing treatment side effects is like playing \"a game of whack-a-mole\". (Supplied)\n\n\"In our community, we joke that the side effects are like a game of whack-a-mole, as you never know what you're going to get and when they'll pop up,\" Ms Erzitech said.\n\n\"Changes in my heart, ongoing fatigue, mild nausea, hair loss, low white blood cells and sore joints.\n\n\"But you need to manage it very quickly to stay on the treatment.\n\n\"It is all out of pocket expenses as the medications are not covered by Medicare.\"\n\nMs Erzitech is one of nearly 4,000 people now formally identified as living with metastatic breast cancer. (Supplied)\n\nIt was yet another consequence of being \"invisible\" when it came to data, along with an inability to access clinical trials or new \"life-extending\" treatment regimes.\n\nMs Erzitech is now forced to grapple with the heartbreaking decision of when to tell her sons, now aged five and nine, that one day she will die.\n\nBut she also has a little hope that by being \"officially\" counted in the statistics, the Queensland health system can plan services, direct resources and invest in research that truly meets hers and other sufferers' needs.\n\nLarissa Erzitech with her husband Adrian and their two boys. (Supplied)\n\nPatients have felt 'written off'\n\nQueensland is only the second jurisdiction in the world, after New South Wales, to identify these survivors.\n\nBreast Cancer Network Australia director of policy and advocacy Vicki Durston said \"now, for the first time, these women matter\".\n\n\"This is a turning point, for too long governments have written off people with metastatic breast cancer because it is not curable, forgetting incurable shouldn't mean invisible,\" she said.\n\nVicki Durston says people with metastatic breast cancer have been \"written off\" because it isn't curable. (Supplied)\n\nThe newly released data counts anyone diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1982 to 2024 who were still alive by the end of last year.\n\n\"Without foundational data, where do we even start? If they're not counted, then they're not prioritised through policy planning or cancer plans,\" Ms Durston said.\n\n\"Historically people are counted when diagnosed and again when they die.\n\n\"Governments assumed advanced meant limited survival, however with advancement in treatment options and precision medicines, we now have options to support those diagnosed.\n\n\"Their needs are different to those with early breast cancer and you can't plan for a group you cannot see.\"\n\nThose suffering from metastatic breast cancer have different treatment requirements to early patients. (Supplied)\n\nShe said metastatic breast cancer sufferers have felt \"written off\" for too long, despite advances in oral therapies and new precision treatments extending life spans.\n\n\"So we're doing a lot of advocacy with the Commonwealth government, to say those medicines need to be fast-tracked so that people can get access to them, but so they also do not have to mortgage their home to be able to afford it.\n\n\"There's some assumptions by government that people with advanced breast cancer that has metastasised die, but they all don't.\n\n\"They're living and they're living well. And we want to ensure that there's visibility of that data to advance the advocacy and the policy priorities.\"\n\n'Fighting to live well'\n\nQueensland Minister for Women Fiona Simpson said that while international data was still scarce, Queensland was now nation-leading in improving dignity and recognition for these patients.\n\n\"Up until this point what had been collected nationally was wrong with regard to the true impact of this cancer on people's lives,\" she said.\n\n\"Why you need to know the truth is that it will drive better treatment options and hopefully life-extending care.\n\n\"It is not about just fighting this disease but fighting to live well.\"",

    "text": "The farming town of Orroroo, in South Australia's mid north, is a microcosm of the drought plaguing swathes of Australia. What is its future in a changing climate?\n\nThe auburn dirt of Orroroo is like that found in many towns in regional Australia, rich in colour, but devastating when swept into the air.\n\nThe red-coloured dirt of the land near Orroroo. ( )\n\nA dust storm hit Orroro in May, blanketing the town. ( )\n\nLast month the town, and many others across South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales were blanketed in thick dust as storms swept across the country.\n\nFor those in Orroroo, the hope had been for a much-needed reprieve from ongoing drought.\n\nThe dust storm covered Orroroo's school. ( )\n\nBut instead they were met with amber skies, forcing locals and school children to remain indoors as the front passed.\n\nOrroroo school principal Peter Usher.\n\nOrroroo Area School principal Peter Usher said it was the first time he had seen a change in the brave face of the community he has called home since the start of the year.\n\n\"It was almost like the land slapping everyone in the face of reality,\" he says.\n\nThe view from inside Orroroo's school. ( )\n\nAlong with their principal, the school's students were watching the topsoil from their family farms blow away.\n\nElla is a student at Orroroo Primary School. ( )\n\n\"It was all red, the sky, and it was yuck,\" year two student Ella recalls.\n\n\"It ruined it a bit more because we were starting to get green grass ... but then it unfortunately blew it away.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nIn a bid to share the news from their small town, student Clay took to Facebook with a weather report.\n\n\"News update from Orroroo, can we please have rain?\"\n\nThe town of Orroroo sits on the southern edge of the Flinders Ranges. ( )\n\nOrroroo sits on the southern edge of the Flinders Ranges, near Goyder's Line, a geographical mark drawn by the state's surveyor general in 1865 which determined where crops could be planted.\n\nOrroroo is a farming community in SA's mid north region. ( )\n\nFarming is at the town's heart.\n\nStudents from throughout the region bus into school each day. ( )\n\nEach day, children and some staff members from surrounding farms make their way to school.\n\nBut the weight of the ongoing drought continues to bear down, bringing with it both emotional and practical responsibilities.\n\nFor year two student Clay, the workload for his family has only increased.\n\nClay is a student at Orroroo Primary school. ( )\n\n\"Feeding sheep at the moment lots,\" he said.\n\nClay's family runs a farm.\n\n\"We haven't even got our seeder out yet, but we mostly grow grain down at where we call the valley.\n\n\"Last year it was terrible down there too.\"\n\nGrant Chapman also understands the weight of responsibility of running a family farm.\n\nGrant Chapman is the Mayor of Orroroo and a sheep farmer. ( )\n\nThe third-generation farmer has dedicated his life to the land and is also the local mayor.\n\nGrant has removed crops from his property due to a lack of rain. ( )\n\nLike everyone else, he watched what little feed that was left on the ground blow away in the storm last month.\n\n\"The dust started reasonably early in the morning. It continued all day just before dark,\" he recalls.\n\nGrant Chapman's farm has felt the impact of drought. ( )\n\n\"It was huge winds and dust storms like we've never seen in this area before. Not in my lifetime anyway.\n\n\"It just swept the country bare. Any remaining dry food that was about, even though there wasn't much, is gone \u2026 it was just a really devastating day.\"\n\nGrant's family has farmed just outside of Orroroo for three generations, and on his property they are entering their third season of drought.\n\n\"I think it's the worst drought in my lifetime,\" he says.\n\n\"I've talked to my dad, he's 92-years-old and he says he can't remember a drought being this widespread.\"\n\nEven before this drought hit, Grant made the decision to get out of cropping altogether.\n\nThe land, once filled with crops and greenery ...\n\nGrant Chapman's property was once covered in lush, green crops in 2016. ( )\n\nGrant's farm is now dry and dusty after years of drought conditions. ( )\n\n... now resembles a dry, dusty moonscape.\n\nHe now just farms sheep, but when he spoke to the ABC he only had three weeks of feed left.\n\nIt has left him with the difficult choice to sell part of his flock.\n\nWithout rain he may have to destock completely, seeing years of hard work breeding the best stock disappear.\n\nIt is a familiar tale for many working the land.\n\nAt the South Australian Livestock Exchange in Dublin, north of Adelaide, Elders livestock manager Matt Ward is auctioning sheep that, in a normal year, would still be grazing in paddocks.\n\nLivestock sales have been booming as people offload their stock amid the drought. ( )\n\nThe South Australian Livestock Exchange in Dublin, north-west of Adelaide, is a hive of activity. ( )\n\n\"Today in particular there's probably three lines of ewe lambs in the sale yards \u2026 that are being sold as ewe lambs because they can't carry them through \u2026 to be sold in the spring,\" he says.\n\n\"With lack of feed in the whole of South Australia, the graziers can't afford to buy them so they're going to slaughter unfortunately.\"\n\nSheep at the South Australian Livestock Exchange. ( )\n\nSome sheep in good condition are setting record prices.\n\nSome sheep were in poor condition. ( )\n\nOthers, are showing the signs of a continued drought crisis.\n\nReprieve not guaranteed\n\nThe anecdotes from farmers that they have never seen a drought this bad are backed by the data.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Meterology (BOM) the start of the year saw the lowest rainfall on record for large parts of south-eastern Australia, from Western Australia, through South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.\n\nFor some of those regions, they have been in the bottom five per cent of rainfall records for 26 months.\n\nIt is a trend, the BOM says is being influenced, at least in part, by climate change.\n\nSwathes of Australia have been impacted by drought. ( )\n\nFarmer Rob Pearce runs Sunnydale Station, about 40 kilometres out of Broken Hill. ( )\n\n\"We are seeing a declining trend in rainfall across much of southern Australia,\" Climatologist Caitlin Minney said.\n\n\"That's been observed definitely in the last 30 years so in south-east Australia, there's been a decrease of about nine per cent in that April to October which is that key, cool-season growing time, since 1994.\"\n\nRob Pearce farms sheep in western New South Wales near Broken Hill.\n\nHe says the last few seasons haven't been too bad, but they're heading into drought too.\n\nRob Pearce is hoping the rains will come this winter. ( )\n\nHe's preparing for the worst while he waits for rain, but remains in good spirits.\n\n\"God's got the say and I haven't got his email address,\" he said.\n\n\"I could see the writing on the wall [in] October so I've been sort of planning for this, getting sheep down like breeding them quick and getting them out quick because I didn't think it was going to rain.\"\n\nBack in South Australia, Alison Henderson is also trying to focus on resilience.\n\nShe runs a Merino stud less than an hour south of Orroroo.\n\nHer family has farmed here for five generations, but said this drought was \"unprecedented\" for the district.\n\n\"Definitely my dad, my grandpa, their generations can't remember a season like it, and they've got a few years in their memory that stick out as bad drought years,\" she says.\n\nAlison Henderson is a fifth-generation farmer. ( )\n\nThe reality of the drought is clear from above. ( )\n\nAlison Henderson is hoping her sustainable practices will future-proof her business. ( )\n\nShe is among the next generation of Australia's farmers, and despite having to sell off part of her flock and spend additional money on feed, she is hopeful for the future.\n\nShe is breeding Poll Merino sheep that are more resistant to drought.\n\n\"I love these genetics because what we've seen is growth rates, despite of the drought conditions, have been the best we've ever seen,\" she says.\n\n\"In the good times they're able to consume that feed and store that energy in their body as body condition and during tough times like this, they've still got that body condition that they can utilise and it means also that we don't have to feed them as much because they are able to utilise what they're eating better.\"\n\nChildren play in the mud kitchen at the school. ( )\n\nBack at Orroroo Area school, many students are also a part of the next generation of the town's farmers.\n\nChildren play in the sandpit Orroroo Area School. ( )\n\nWhile they play in the sand with miniature animals and trucks, their parents and families are working hard to survive.\n\nChildren playing in the sandpit. ( )\n\nFor those about to graduate, the transition is much closer to the horizon.\n\n\"I guess growing up that's always been the thing 'oh yeah I'll just go back and work on the farm',\" year 12 student Cooper Shackleford says.\n\n\"But it's getting to the point now where it's almost like 'well am I able to make a living off the farm and is it going to be able to support the family that's already there plus more people coming on?'\"\n\nAshby Thomas wants to go into agronomy when he finishes school, but when he did work experience at a business last year he saw another impact of the drought.\n\n\"There was no work on at all because there had been no rain to get the crops up so hopefully there'll be rain soon but there's not a lot of work around for that type of business,\" he says.\n\nPeter Usher says the town will be relieved when proper rains hit. ( )\n\nCooper Shackleford is in year 12 and has bright hopes for the future. ( )\n\nAshby Thomas is is Year 12 and wants to get into agronomy when he finishes school. ( )\n\nBut the most obvious answer to what is needed is simply rain, and lots of it.\n\nThere was good news in Orroroo and across much of drought-affected Australia last weekend when vast areas experienced downpours.\n\nWhile it wasn't enough to break the drought, locals say every drop helps restore their faith in the region's future.\n\nSchool principal Peter Usher said the town will be celebrating when big rains finally arrive. ( )\n\nPrincipal Peter Usher says when it rains, he'll give his students the chance to celebrate.\n\nEarlier this year, a moment of rain caused huge joy, despite its brief appearance.\n\n\"I know that when we get rain, because we will, it will be truly a celebration,\" he says.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to seeing how beautiful the area is when we do have rain and the crops are growing because everyone's described that to me.\n\n\"At the moment they're all, not apologising, but they're saying this is not normally Orroroo, we normally have some rain.\"\n\nCredits:\n\nReporting: Leah MacLennan\n\nWords: Leah MacLennan and Jessica Haynes\n\nDigital production: Jessica Haynes\n\nPhotography and drone imagery: Che Chorley\n\nAdditional reporting: Will Hunter\n\nAdditional images: Will Hunter, Peter Usher and Grant Chapman\n\nEditing: Sara Garcia",

    "text": "The IVF industry is under the microscope after major fertility provider Monash IVF apologised for a second embryo bungle.\n\nDays after the company told the stock market about the latest case, its chief executive officer resigned.\n\nIt followed revelations in April that one of Monash IVF's Brisbane patients had been mistakenly implanted with another woman's embryo in 2023 and gave birth to a baby who had no genetic links to her later that year.\n\nAn independent review is ongoing.\n\nApproximately 20,000 babies are born from IVF treatment in Australia every year, according to the Australian and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database.\n\nSo, what is the process, what are the checks and balances, and how rare are such bungles?\n\nDuring IVF treatments, an egg is fertilised with sperm in a lab before being implanted into the uterus. (Supplied: Adobe)\n\nWhat is IVF?\n\nIn vitro fertilisation \u2014 or IVF \u2014 is one of the most common assisted reproductive technology procedures (ART).\n\nThe process involves collecting a donor or patient's eggs, then fertilising them with sperm in a Petri dish in a lab.\n\nA fertilised egg \u2014 known as an embryo \u2014 is then implanted into the woman's uterus.\n\nWhat are the checks and balances?\n\nFertility educator and IVF patient advocate Lucy Lines has previously worked as an embryologist \u2014 a scientist who specialises in developing embryos.\n\nShe says whenever eggs, sperm or embryos are moved in the lab, the dishes and paperwork are all labelled with the patient's name, their ID number, and date of birth.\n\nIVF bungle could spark battle over parentage Photo shows In vitro fertilisation Monash IVF realised the mistake in February, after the birth parents asked to transfer their remaining frozen embryos to another provider.\n\nIn some labs, they are allocated a colour code as well, she says.\n\n\"At minimum, there are three points of reference for each client inside the lab,\" she says.\n\n\"So then when anything is moved from one dish or tube to another dish or tube, a second embryologist will come along and audibly repeat [the patient's name, date of birth, and the ID number].\n\n\"That is the historical way that it was done.\n\n\"In some labs they've added an extra level, a barcode that requires a scanner to read the barcode, or in some other labs they have an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) label, which has an auto-reader on the bench top or workspace and that reader will sound if there are things on that bench that don't match each other.\"\n\nAdvocates are urging parents considering IVF to \"arm yourself with knowledge\" about the process. (AP: Sang Tan)\n\nWhat are the regulations?\n\nIt varies.\n\nThere are more than 40 \"different pieces of legislation\" governing ART and IVF across the country, according to the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ).\n\nFor example, laws to regulate ART providers in Queensland only passed parliament last year.\n\nBy comparison, Victoria has had laws in place for years.\n\nParents urged to DNA test kids after second IVF error Photo shows A woman stands in a room with bookshelves behind her. She is looking up and has her hands on her hips. After a second embryo mix-up at Monash IVF, activists say \"rare mistakes\" are systemic failures and urge families to get DNA tests.\n\nFSANZ\u2019s Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee (RTAC) is responsible for setting performance standards and granting licences to fertility providers across the country.\n\nThe society and RTAC are currently operated on a \"volunteer basis by professionals within the sector who have taken on additional responsibilities\".\n\nFSANZ is calling for the establishment of RTAC as an independent statutory authority to \"strengthen oversight and trust in the sector\".\n\nThat is backed by the Victorian Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas who said yesterday it was concerning that the body that currently accredits fertility care providers is made up of fertility care providers.\n\nYesterday, all Australian states and territories agreed to undertake a review into the implementation of an independent verification body for fertility providers.\n\nDo you know more? Contact Janelle Miles and Kate McKenna\n\nWhat are there calls for?\n\nThere are growing calls for national fertility legislation to replace the \"fragmented\" state and territory laws and provide \"consistent, enforceable standards\".\n\nIVF activist Anastasia Gunn is among those pushing for change.\n\nAnastasia and Lexie Gunn's three sons were conceived through the IVF process. (Four Corners: Ron Foley)\n\n\"We're asking for federal legislation of the industry, which the industry itself are asking for that,\" she says.\n\n\"We're asking for a federal donor conception registry [as] historically gametes and embryos have been moved interstate.\n\n\"Donor conceived people have a right to know their biological and medical history if they choose to.\n\n\"We're choosing to ask for external regulation of the industry.\"\n\nAre embryologists registered?\n\nNo, there is no licensing or registration of embryologists in Australia \u2014 unlike other professions such as doctors and nurses.\n\nIt is something the FSANZ would like to see changed.\n\nEmbryo mix-ups more common overseas Photo shows A close up of a baby in white muslin wrap with stars on it, being held by two adults. No faces are visible. While experts say this case is \"unprecedented\" in Australia, it's happened multiple times in the US, as far back as 1999.\n\n\"We continue to advocate for robust professional recognition of embryologists in Australia \u2014 both to uphold standards and to protect the public,\" a FSANZ spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"The medical laboratory professionals in Australia chose to set up this self-regulated scheme because the Australian Government decided not to include Medical Scientists and Technical Officers in the professions covered by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) when it was established in 2010.\n\n\"Most comparable countries do have formal regulation of Medical Scientists and Technical Officers to protect the public and set minimum standards for ongoing assessment of competency and continuing professional development.\n\n\"It would require the Australian Government to legislate mandatory registration.\"\n\nHow often do these mistakes happen?\n\nThe industry insists they are rare.\n\nBut others \u2014 such as Sydney Law School lecturer Christopher Rudge \u2014 acknowledge it is also difficult to know without specific data.\n\n\"The recent history of IVF mistakes and errors is somewhat clouded by reported settlements, private settlements, so it is hard to know the true frequency of these errors,\" Dr Rudge told the ABC earlier this week.\n\nMonash IVF is a publicly listed company, which means it has \"disclosure obligations\".\n\nMonash IVF has made two statements to the ASX regarding embryo mix-ups in as many months.\n\nOver the past two months, it has made statements to the ASX \u2014 and its shareholders \u2014 about the two embryo incidents.\n\nHowever the ASX also issued Monash IVF a 'please explain' about the timing of the Brisbane announcement \u2014 which came weeks after the company said it became aware of the mix-up.\n\nMonash IVF's chief financial officer said the company did not expect the bungle would affect its share price \"as it was an isolated incidence of human error\".\n\nThe company's share price plummeted from $1.08 to 69 cents after the Brisbane bungle was made public in April.\n\nAn independent review is ongoing into two separate IVF bungles at Monash IVF this year. (Supplied: Adobe)\n\nWhat should patients be asking their clinic?\n\nMs Lines says it was complex.\n\n\"My only answer is, if you're looking down the barrel of IVF, arm yourself with the knowledge of what's actually involved \u2026 so that you can empower yourself to ask the questions that you need the answers to,\" she says.\n\n\" As a culture, we're very used to going to our doctor and doing what we're told.

    "text": "A survivor of sexual abuse at a Catholic school in Victoria has won a claim against his ex-lawyers, after suing the law firm for negligence.\n\nThe survivor was abused at Monivae College in Hamilton in the late 1970s by two Catholic brothers and was originally represented in his lawsuit against the Catholic order by Waller Legal in 2015.\n\nHe first settled his claim against the Order of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) for $140,000 in February 2017.\n\nHe later went on to sue Waller Legal, claiming the firm was negligent and provided inadequate advice when representing him in that claim.\n\nLast week, in a judgement against Waller Legal, Supreme Court Justice Jack Forrest awarded the survivor $263,000.\n\nRightside Legal partner Michael Magazanik, who represented the survivor in his action against his ex-lawyers, described it as a \"landmark\" decision.\n\n\"It sets out the obligations of a lawyer when representing someone who's been sexually abused as a child,\" Mr Magazanik said.\n\nThe survivor, who legally cannot be identified, told the ABC he felt satisfied with the judgement.\n\n\"It's been a long process,\" he said.\n\n\"I just kept fighting, and I'm hoping that my victory, and ultimately the judgement, will encourage others to pursue their claims to the full amount.\"\n\nHe said any others who felt dissatisfied at their settlement should seek new legal representation.\n\nUnder its principal solicitor Dr Vivian Waller, Waller Legal is among the most prominent specialist abuse law firms in Melbourne.\n\nAnother lawyer at the firm was responsible for the day-to-day management of the survivor's case against MSC.\n\nIn a statement, lawyers representing Waller Legal said the law firm was reviewing the judgement, and considering an appeal.\n\n\"Waller Legal founder and principal Dr Vivian Waller has represented and advocated for hundreds of survivors of institutional sexual abuse for almost 30 years, and will continue to do so,\" it said.\n\n\"She has been instrumental in agitating for important law reforms for survivors.\"\n\nMSC said due to ongoing legal matters, the Catholic order would not comment\n\nLaw firm's advice included 'furphies': Judge\n\nThe survivor suffered the abuse between the age of 11 and 12, and said when he first began pursuing legal action against the MSC in 2015, Waller Legal seemed to be the only firm helping victims of historic child abuse.\n\nHe described the process with Waller Legal as being \"like on a conveyer belt\".\n\nThe survivor took the firm to court alleging negligent advice and misleading conduct in relation to both the handling of his economic loss (lost earnings) claim and the advice given to him.\n\nThe Ellis defence was repeatedly referenced in Justice Forrest's judgement, which refers to a legal technicality that prevented abuse survivors from suing unincorporated organisations, including churches.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Forrest said Waller Legal's belief in the efficacy of the Ellis defence was \"misconceived and negligently held at the time\" the survivor was represented by the firm.\n\nJustice Forrest also said advice that any claim faced \"insurmountable obstacles\" were \"furphies\".\n\n\"Not one of the points now identified by Waller Legal and described as constituting an insurmountable obstacle was mentioned by MSC in the negotiations to settle \u2026 in 2016 and 2017,\" the judgement stated.\n\nThe judge threw out the allegation of misleading conduct.\n\n'A point of principle' for abuse survivor\n\nMr Magazanik began representing the survivor in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, the survivor launched a fresh suit against MSC, and in 2022 settled his claim for an additional $400,000.\n\nIn this latter case, the judge refused to set aside the part that related to his claim for economic loss.\n\nLawyer Michael Magazanik represented the abuse survivor in his case against Waller Legal. (ABC News: David Weber)\n\n\"My client has enormous endurance,\" Mr Magazanik said.\n\n\"He's been through two police processes in relation to his abusers.\n\n\"This is a point of principle for him. He wanted to stand up for what he thought was right.\"\n\nOf the two Catholic brothers accused of abuse in the case, one has been sentenced in 2013 to two years and three months in prison, while the other had not been convicted of any criminal offences.\n\nFurther legal action possible\n\nMr Magazanik said Rightside Legal had separately been pursuing a class action lawsuit over allegations the firm failed to sufficiently claim for lost earnings, but the Supreme Court had found the details of each case were too different for a group action to progress.\n\nHe said many of those in the class action were now contemplating individual cases against Waller Legal.\n\n\"We will read this decision very carefully and give each of them individual advice about their prospects,\" he said.",

    "text": "Star batter Steve Smith could be forced to miss Australia's upcoming tour of the West Indies after suffering a \"gruesome\" compound dislocation of his finger.\n\nIn a major blow for Australia's immediate and long-term prospects, Smith hurt his right little finger during a crucial moment of the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's on Friday, local time.\n\nWearing a helmet while standing closer in slips than normal, the former Australia captain put down a regulation chance off Mitchell Starc that would have dismissed Proteas captain Temba Bavuma for only two.\n\nSmith immediately left the field in immense pain after spilling the catch that would have put Australia in the box seat to claim back-to-back WTC titles.\n\nInstead, Bavuma combined with Aiden Markram for an unbeaten 143-run stand to put South Africa in reach of a famous victory on 2-213, just 69 runs from the winning line.\n\nThe 36-year-old was assessed by medical staff in the Lord's change rooms, before being taken to hospital for X-rays and further treatment.\n\nAs of an hour after stumps, Smith was still in hospital and the Australian team had no further update on his condition.\n\n\"We weren't really up to speed in terms of how gruesome the injury was,\" Australia assistant coach Daniel Vettori said.\n\n\"We just heard there was a fear of the compound fracture or dislocation, something of that nature.\n\n'We'll just wait and see what comes back after he gets back from hospital.\"\n\nA compound dislocation is when bone pierces the skin, which could mean Smith needs surgery and a long rehabilitation.\n\nOne of the greatest red-ball batters of all-time, Smith's looming absence will be a major blow after scoring four centuries from his last six Tests in a stunning late-career resurgence.\n\nBut Smith's misfortune could give out-of-form teammate Marnus Labuschagne a reprieve.\n\nThe 30-year-old Labuschagne averaged less than 30 during this WTC cycle during the past two years, with his last century coming back in July 2023.\n\nA long-term number three, Labuschagne moved up to open for the first time in his Test career for this match.\n\nBut the promotion failed to snap him out of his lean spell, making 17 and 22.\n\nQuick hits from the third day of the World Test Championship Photo shows Mitchell Starc, Steve Smith and Temba Bavuma. Steve Smith and Temba Bavuma both end up in the hands of medical staff, as Mitchell Starc scores his first 50 in six years. Here are five quick hits from the third day of the World Test Championship decider.\n\nTeenage tyro Sam Konstas, who announced himself last Boxing Day, is almost certain to be given an opportunity as opener for Australia's first tour of the Caribbean in 10 years.\n\nIf Smith can't play, Konstas could slot back in to open with Usman Khawaja, while Labuschagne would likely drop down to number three.\n\nBut even Khawaja, who turns 39 later this year, is under pressure to keep his Test career going after scores of 0 and 7 in this Test.\n\nAustralia's first Test begins in Barbados in 12 days on June 25, followed by matches in Grenada and Jamaica.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "In his final message to air traffic controllers, the plane\u2019s pilot said the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had \u201cno thrust\u201d, was \u201closing power\u201d and was \u201cunable to lift\u201d. The Dreamliner is designed to be able to climb and fly safely in the event of having only one engine operational. Speculation has been rife over what may have caused the crash, including the possibility of pilot error, faulty flaps, electrical problems or engine failure. A bird strike is a prominent hypothesis, and could have caused a catastrophic engine failure leading to such a situation, but there has been no evidence of flocks in the area at the time of the crash. \u201cMore than one thing went wrong here. The thing that might have started it, and I think probably did, was a loss of power,\u201d Learmount said\n\n\u201cWhether it was loss of power on one engine or both engines is not clear. But the failure of a single engine should not cause a crew to lose control of a modern airliner, even in the critical early climb phase. Loading \u201cAt the same time, simultaneous engine failures for unconnected reasons simply do not happen, based on the entire history of aviation. So if there was a failure of both, the question is what could have caused it.\u201d The two engines on the plane are made by General Electric aviation and have a good safety history. On Friday, the Indian aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, issued a notice to Air India to conduct more inspections of all of its 787-8 and 787-9 fleet with GE engines. This includes an inspection of the fuel monitoring systems, a test of the electronic engine control, a check of the hydraulics and a review of take-off parameters. \u201cPower assurance checks\u201d are also to be done on each plane within two weeks.\n\nDr Akhil Bhardwaj, a senior lecturer in aviation safety at the University of Bath, said he believed the DGCA was acting with an \u201cunderstandable abundance of caution\u201d. Last year, a United Airlines 787 jet, which has the same GEnx-1B engines as the doomed AI 171 flight, suffered an \u201cuncontained left engine failure shortly after take-off\u201d while flying from Singapore to San Francisco last year, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. The engine ceased working at cruise altitude and set alight, according to the report, with the pilots managing to circle back and land the plane in Singapore using just one engine. A GE Aerospace spokesman said: \u201cSafety is our top priority, and we support the action being taken by the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation for enhanced safety inspections of the Air India 787-8/9 fleet.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work closely with the appropriate regulatory and investigative agencies, and we are committed to providing all technical support necessary to understand the cause of this accident.\u201d Loading Experts have suggested that the Dreamliner, which until Thursday had an unblemished safety record, also deployed its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) during the ill-fated 60 seconds between take-off and the crash. The RAT is a propeller-like device that sits in the fuselage between the wings and is only deployed in the most dangerous situations, to provide emergency power to vital electrical systems. Sambulo Matema, a lecturer in aviation management at University College Birmingham, said: \u201cThere is credence to this theory. In a complete power\u2011loss scenario, the aircraft transitions from engine\u2011supplied power to RAT power, and lighting anomalies can occur.\u201d\n\nLoading \u201cThis behaviour aligns with established emergency procedures and the expected performance of aircraft electrical systems under severe duress. \u201cAfter total power loss, the RAT deploys as a fallback power source. During this transition, green emergency lighting activates, and white lights may flash while onboard systems reboot and stabilise.\u201d Learmount, who flew Hercules military transport planes around the Middle East during his RAF career, said the RAT would have sent power to the cockpit. The plane\u2019s batteries would also have supported vital systems. However, neither could have done anything to keep the plane aloft in the event of its turbines spooling down.\n\nLoading All this suggests the fault lay in the engines. However, what could have caused them to shut down remains unclear. One theory is contaminated fuel. In 2010, a Cathay Pacific flight to Hong Kong almost ended in disaster when the pilot was unable to control engine thrust, leading it to land at twice the usual speed. It later emerged that fuel pumped into the plane had been contaminated with saltwater, damaging its engines over time. However, such problems are rare. Learmount said: \u201cIf you go looking for a potential cause of multiple engine failure, fuel contamination could do it. But again, history is against that potential cause in observed reality.\u201d",

    "text": "There is certainly precedence for picking players who originate from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa \u2013 former Crusaders winger Sean Maitland, Dylan Hartley and Matt Stevens, a Junior Springbok, all made the initial selection. There has been a long history of players from the SANZAAR countries finding their way into the Home Nations\u2019 Test teams: in that sense this Lions tour is nothing different, and the \u2018nothing to see here\u2019 argument put forward in some quarters in the northern hemisphere holds water. There is no doubt, either, that all the SANZAAR Lions have displayed a level of personal commitment and passion for their adopted countries. But this is really a numbers game, and the volume of SANZAAR players in this year\u2019s squad is atypical. In fact, it might never be repeated because World Rugby changed the eligibility laws at the end of 2020 to extend the residential qualification period from three years to five years.\n\nIt was a significant rule change advertised at the time to uphold the \u201cintegrity and sanctity\u201d of the international game, but it came too late to affect this Lions squad. The second question of whether it matters is an emotive one. Lions icon Willie McBride raised his head above the parapet a few months ago and said he was \u201cbothered\u201d by the presence of eight players who were not born in either Britain or Ireland. McBride was subsequently labelled by some as an old man shouting at the clouds, but not so fast. This week, recently retired England halfback Danny Care voiced the same sentiment. \u201cWhatever I say here, you\u2019re going to get stick. You open yourself up to it,\u201d he told the BBC Rugby Union Weekly podcast. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit that well with me that some of these\u2026 both your starting wingers are going to be lads that never, ever once in their childhood or even their mid-20s ever dreamt of wearing a red Lions jersey.\u201d\n\nLoading In other words, it does matter, and it matters to British and Irish players \u2013 this is not simply a topic being beaten up by the venomous Australian media to unsettle the tourists. Schmidt, of course, has to be careful on the subject. As Ireland coach he benefited from the services of both Bundee Aki, a New Zealander of Samoan heritage, and CJ Stander, a South African, in a famous win against the All Blacks in 2018. And, as he said earlier in the week, he coached Bealham as well. It would be hypocritical of him to use the SANZAAR players as a stick to beat the Lions with. But for the rest of us, there is the nagging question of why the Lions have been permitted to turn SANZAAR players against the Wallabies in a series that is ultimately designed to test the quality of the rugby that is being played within the respective borders of the Australia and the British and Irish Isles?",

    "text": "London: A few days ago, Pat Cummins was queried about some unresolved elements of the 2018 \u201cSandpapergate\u201d series in South Africa by an English interviewer, and gave the blunt reply: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nOne man with much fonder memories of that encounter is Aiden Markram, then early in his Test career.

By sculpting an unbeaten 102 in the company of his captain Temba Bavuma in the World Test Championship being decided at Lord\u2019s to pull the Proteas to within sight of victory, he has now played an innings to surpass it. At stumps on a match-defining day in London, Markram had guided the Proteas to 2-213, needing just another 69 runs to pull off a remarkable win.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've created something beautiful, which was supposed to be a good deed. It's almost like you're being punished because your information was held on a computer system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a sperm donor whom we will call Isaac.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has used an actor to record his comments, to obscure his identity and protect his sensitive personal information, which was part of a data breach earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all began when he agreed to be a sperm donor for some friends of his who couldn\u2019t conceive themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being a sperm donor is the epitome of awkward. You kind of feel like you're a bit of produce to some extent, which has been selected by your genetic characteristics. Personally, it's like why did they choose me? And that's an interesting thing, which makes you go to the depths of your own self-confidence. But the whole process is naturally incredibly awkward because effectively you've been chosen to jizz in a cup.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Isaac wanted to help the couple and agreed to go ahead with being their sperm donor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI-V-F ((in vitro fertilisation)) treatment is becoming increasingly more common in Australia, with one in every 18 births now a product of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple decided to go to Genea Fertility, one of Australia\u2019s largest I-V-F clinics, where staff asked Isaac several probing questions about his medical history, and he underwent a series of psychological sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You go through the longest form I've ever been through in my life. Any diagnosis you've had, any medication you've had. The staff there were really, really lovely, and particularly given the awkwardness of a sperm donation, they're adept at handling that awkward situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac also spoke to staff about intimate personal circumstances, about himself and his family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have mental health issues, and medication could be quite a lifesaver. I have a history of taking medication since I was 17 years old. It's still highly stigmatised. I also have a family history of autoimmune disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith his donation, the couple conceived their first child, but the joy Isaac feels for helping his dear friends start a family has been mixed with frustration and anger.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, Genea informed Isaac via email that his data was among a batch that had been breached by cybercriminals and posted to the Dark Web.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exposed data includes people's medical history, diagnoses and treatments, medications and prescriptions, and pathology and diagnostic test results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've created something beautiful, which was supposed to be a good deed. It's almost like you're being punished because your information was held on a computer system. I don't know what the next step is, but having some information about what the fuck's happening is probably a bloody good step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only could Isaac be at risk of fraud or blackmail, but so could any children conceived through the clinic, including his friend\u2019s newborn.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour months later, he feels left in the dark about what Genea is doing to protect customers from hackers and scammers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenea declined to be interviewed by SBS News, instead pointing to statements it has made on its website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our teams and cybersecurity experts are working hard to urgently review the impacted data. This is a detailed and complex process which will take some time to complete to ensure we can clearly understand the nature and extent of the data that has been published and identify impacted individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what happens now?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Dali Kaafar is the executive director of Macquarie University's cybersecurity hub.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says investigating cybercrime can be a lengthy process and in the meantime, Isaac's personal data could be used against him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they actually sense some form of vulnerability with their victim, for instance, the victim is trying to hide some sort of information from the employer or from their families, they'll probably try to leverage that in a form of blackmail.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kaafar predicts data breaches will only become more frequent, especially against companies like Genea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Health providers handle obviously vast amounts of highly sensitive personal information, not only the medical histories or the diagnosis, et cetera, but things like contact details of patients and so on. So it makes them immediately attractive targets for cybercriminals. And so I think the very first explanation or the very first view of why the health sector is consistently reported as the highest number of data breaches in Australia and globally as well, by the way, is largely due to that first piece, which is the volume and the sensitivity of the data is there. They're definitely by nature a very attractive target for cyber criminals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a scary thought for Isaac when he thinks about both his future and that of the donor-conceived child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What happens if I get a job which is relatively high profile or dealing with sensitive activity, could this open me up to not getting employed because an employer might've found my internet history, and maybe they have had ethical concerns or concerns with my health record? There are lots of bits and pieces which we all choose to disclose or not disclose as we go about our day. And if that information is out there, it's taken away my agency and my choice to disclose that information if I want to. That's only compounded further by the lack of information that I've been provided about this investigation and the data breach.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wants to see consequences for the data breach and for Genea to be held accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some things are more sensitive than others, and if you're at the more extreme end of sensitivity, you want the ramifications to be higher and you also want to make sure there's incentive to not have this happen again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike financial fraud, where victims can demonstrate losses as a dollar figure, the value of a person's privacy is subjective.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaith Gordon, an associate professor in law at the Australian National University, says people affected by breaches can make legal claims for the breach itself as well as its impact, and there could be compensation for losses such as embarrassment, humiliation and anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of legal and ethical accountability for these clinics. They do have ethical and also legal duties. For example, under Australian law, Australia's Privacy Act, there is health data protection requirements and there's medical ethical guidelines as well about informed consent and data protection. So breaches can give rise to claims for this breach and for the impact of it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Gordon says there's more that can be done to protect people, especially children conceived through these clinics\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A data breach could expose very, very personal information, including names and dates of birth and donor status and notes about embryos. So that can result in significant stigma and psychological harm and potentially future discrimination as well. Child ren have very specific rights and very specific vulnerabilities, and these need to be protected, and they also need to be empowered to actually access justice when something does go wrong in this space as well.\"\n\n\n\n",

Cold temperatures can also make mould in a house worse and weaken a person's immune system.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to a 2023 study published in the Energy Research and Social Science journal, across the sampled homes, 81 per cent were below 18 degrees from June to August, with an average temperature of 16.5C.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian homes were colder than Finland, which averaged temperatures of 20 to 24 degrees, and Greenland, which had an average indoor temperature of 21.8C.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian homes are often uninsulated, draughty, or fitted with inefficient heaters, meaning they are prone to letting in cold air and letting out warm air.\n\n\n\nAustralia's regulatory standards and building codes have also historically been less stringent than other countries, according to Professor Ralph Horne, associate deputy vice chancellor of research and innovation at RMIT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As far back as 2005, research comparing Australian cities to those overseas found housing in compatible climate zones in North America and Europe was 55 per cent more efficient for heating and cooling energy compared to minimum standard housing in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The average energy efficiency [NatHERS] rating of all the overseas comparison homes was over seven stars, and we have yet to implement seven stars here in Australia, almost 20 years later.\"\n\n\n\nWhat can you do to make your house warmer?\n\nFortunately, there are a few things you can do to enhance the warmth inside your home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you own your property, consider retrofitting and upgrading your heating and insulation systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can include improving insulation in the floor, walls and ceilings, and sealing cracks in windows, door frames and floors.\n\n\n\nInstalling a split-system air conditioning and heating system, as well as floor heating, can also help make your house feel warmer.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should also regularly maintain heating systems and clear out filters to ensure they are working efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading heating systems can be costly, and energy efficiency expert Adam Corrigan, founder of Your Energy Friend, said each household is different and there are many energy-saving options to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing he recommends for households is to analyse their power bills and shop around to get the best deal, followed by making your house more energy-efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to make your home more comfortable, get your insulation sorted and do your draft proofing. That's your best return on investment. That's your best bang for buck,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCorrigan said simple changes such as installing heavy-lined curtains and a box pelmet (which goes around the top of the curtain) can be very effective at keeping your home warm and are much cheaper than double-glazed windows, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile renters cannot make such changes to homes, there are some affordable options to stay warmer in winter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your house has draughts, you can apply weather strips, 'door snakes' or other barriers around windows or door frames to prevent cold air from entering the house, and to block warm air from escaping.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have hard floors, adding rugs can provide some insulation and add warmth underfoot, and if you have ceiling fans, using the reverse setting can distribute warm air from the ceiling.\n\n\n\nFor rental homes without heating systems, portable electric or oil heaters can be an effective option for heating up single rooms. To maintain the desired heating in a specific area, ensure doors and windows are closed to prevent heat from escaping.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorne said while Australia has had a longstanding awareness of drought and water efficiency, there has not been enough of a focus on energy efficiency in homes \u2014 meaning many residents are now left in cold houses, and unable to afford heating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAn implicit reliance on cheap energy has now become increasingly challenged by the need to respond to climate change, and the rise in energy poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For a variety of reasons, energy costs have risen across Australia and this has brought to light the inefficiency of Australian homes, as households struggle to keep the heating on and pay the bills.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "In his final message to air traffic controllers, the plane\u2019s pilot said the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had \u201cno thrust\u201d, was \u201closing power\u201d and was \u201cunable to lift\u201d. The Dreamliner is designed to be able to climb and fly safely in the event of having only one engine operational. Speculation has been rife over what may have caused the crash, including the possibility of pilot error, faulty flaps, electrical problems or engine failure. A bird strike is a prominent hypothesis, and could have caused a catastrophic engine failure leading to such a situation, but there has been no evidence of flocks in the area at the time of the crash. \u201cMore than one thing went wrong here. The thing that might have started it, and I think probably did, was a loss of power,\u201d Learmount said\n\n\u201cWhether it was loss of power on one engine or both engines is not clear. But the failure of a single engine should not cause a crew to lose control of a modern airliner, even in the critical early climb phase. Loading \u201cAt the same time, simultaneous engine failures for unconnected reasons simply do not happen, based on the entire history of aviation. So if there was a failure of both, the question is what could have caused it.\u201d The two engines on the plane are made by General Electric aviation and have a good safety history. On Friday, the Indian aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, issued a notice to Air India to conduct more inspections of all of its 787-8 and 787-9 fleet with GE engines. This includes an inspection of the fuel monitoring systems, a test of the electronic engine control, a check of the hydraulics and a review of take-off parameters. \u201cPower assurance checks\u201d are also to be done on each plane within two weeks.\n\nDr Akhil Bhardwaj, a senior lecturer in aviation safety at the University of Bath, said he believed the DGCA was acting with an \u201cunderstandable abundance of caution\u201d. Last year, a United Airlines 787 jet, which has the same GEnx-1B engines as the doomed AI 171 flight, suffered an \u201cuncontained left engine failure shortly after take-off\u201d while flying from Singapore to San Francisco last year, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. The engine ceased working at cruise altitude and set alight, according to the report, with the pilots managing to circle back and land the plane in Singapore using just one engine. A GE Aerospace spokesman said: \u201cSafety is our top priority, and we support the action being taken by the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation for enhanced safety inspections of the Air India 787-8/9 fleet.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work closely with the appropriate regulatory and investigative agencies, and we are committed to providing all technical support necessary to understand the cause of this accident.\u201d Loading Experts have suggested that the Dreamliner, which until Thursday had an unblemished safety record, also deployed its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) during the ill-fated 60 seconds between take-off and the crash. The RAT is a propeller-like device that sits in the fuselage between the wings and is only deployed in the most dangerous situations, to provide emergency power to vital electrical systems. Sambulo Matema, a lecturer in aviation management at University College Birmingham, said: \u201cThere is credence to this theory. In a complete power\u2011loss scenario, the aircraft transitions from engine\u2011supplied power to RAT power, and lighting anomalies can occur.\u201d\n\nLoading \u201cThis behaviour aligns with established emergency procedures and the expected performance of aircraft electrical systems under severe duress. \u201cAfter total power loss, the RAT deploys as a fallback power source. During this transition, green emergency lighting activates, and white lights may flash while onboard systems reboot and stabilise.\u201d Learmount, who flew Hercules military transport planes around the Middle East during his RAF career, said the RAT would have sent power to the cockpit. The plane\u2019s batteries would also have supported vital systems. However, neither could have done anything to keep the plane aloft in the event of its turbines spooling down.\n\nLoading All this suggests the fault lay in the engines. However, what could have caused them to shut down remains unclear. One theory is contaminated fuel. In 2010, a Cathay Pacific flight to Hong Kong almost ended in disaster when the pilot was unable to control engine thrust, leading it to land at twice the usual speed. It later emerged that fuel pumped into the plane had been contaminated with saltwater, damaging its engines over time. However, such problems are rare. Learmount said: \u201cIf you go looking for a potential cause of multiple engine failure, fuel contamination could do it. But again, history is against that potential cause in observed reality.\u201d",

    "text": "There is certainly precedence for picking players who originate from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa \u2013 former Crusaders winger Sean Maitland, Dylan Hartley and Matt Stevens, a Junior Springbok, all made the initial selection. There has been a long history of players from the SANZAAR countries finding their way into the Home Nations\u2019 Test teams: in that sense this Lions tour is nothing different, and the \u2018nothing to see here\u2019 argument put forward in some quarters in the northern hemisphere holds water. There is no doubt, either, that all the SANZAAR Lions have displayed a level of personal commitment and passion for their adopted countries. But this is really a numbers game, and the volume of SANZAAR players in this year\u2019s squad is atypical. In fact, it might never be repeated because World Rugby changed the eligibility laws at the end of 2020 to extend the residential qualification period from three years to five years.\n\nIt was a significant rule change advertised at the time to uphold the \u201cintegrity and sanctity\u201d of the international game, but it came too late to affect this Lions squad. The second question of whether it matters is an emotive one. Lions icon Willie McBride raised his head above the parapet a few months ago and said he was \u201cbothered\u201d by the presence of eight players who were not born in either Britain or Ireland. McBride was subsequently labelled by some as an old man shouting at the clouds, but not so fast. This week, recently retired England halfback Danny Care voiced the same sentiment. \u201cWhatever I say here, you\u2019re going to get stick. You open yourself up to it,\u201d he told the BBC Rugby Union Weekly podcast. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit that well with me that some of these\u2026 both your starting wingers are going to be lads that never, ever once in their childhood or even their mid-20s ever dreamt of wearing a red Lions jersey.\u201d\n\nLoading In other words, it does matter, and it matters to British and Irish players \u2013 this is not simply a topic being beaten up by the venomous Australian media to unsettle the tourists. Schmidt, of course, has to be careful on the subject. As Ireland coach he benefited from the services of both Bundee Aki, a New Zealander of Samoan heritage, and CJ Stander, a South African, in a famous win against the All Blacks in 2018. And, as he said earlier in the week, he coached Bealham as well. It would be hypocritical of him to use the SANZAAR players as a stick to beat the Lions with. But for the rest of us, there is the nagging question of why the Lions have been permitted to turn SANZAAR players against the Wallabies in a series that is ultimately designed to test the quality of the rugby that is being played within the respective borders of the Australia and the British and Irish Isles?",
