    "text": "The US stock market fell after another jarring day, as worries keep dogging Nvidia, bitcoin and other Wall Street stars that their prices shot too high.\n\nAfter quickly sliding to a morning loss of 1.5 per cent, the S&P 500 clawed back nearly all of it before sinking again.\n\nIt finished with a fall of 0.8 per cent and pulled further from its all-time high set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 498 points, or 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2 per cent.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump hurls outrageous slur at female reporter\n\nSpecialist Anthony Matesic and trader Patrick Casey work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP)\n\nThe shaky finish on Wall Street was felt in the Australian share market, which fell at the opening of trade before steadying to go up 0.5 per cent up at midday.\n\nIn the US, Nvidia was again the heaviest weight on the market, and its drop of 2.8 per cent brought its loss for the month so far to more than 10 per cent.\n\nThat\u2019s a steep enough fall that Wall Street has a name for it: a correction.\n\nWhat Nvidia does matters disproportionately to savers\u2019 401(k) accounts because its immense size means it\u2019s the most influential stock on Wall Street. Those 401(k) accounts are the equivalent of Australia's superannuation funds.\n\nIt single-handedly steers the direction of the S&P 500 some days, after fervent demand for its artificial-intelligence chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value.\n\nThe US stock market\u2019s recent struggles are a sharp turnaround from its nearly relentless rally since April, when Wall Street last sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.\n\nREAD MORE: Huge vote on Epstein files after Trump backflip\n\nTrader Anan Patel works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)\n\nThat rally was so strong that critics say it may have carried prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop.\n\nThey point in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania, which have been surging at spectacular speeds for years.\n\nNvidia\u2019s price more than doubled in four of the last five years, for example, while Palantir Technologies\u2019 stock more than doubled in the first six and a half months of this year.\n\nMany big investors still seem to expect stock prices to rise further, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research.\n\nBut when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a chance of very big damage, 45 per cent pointed to an AI bubble.\n\nThat beat out potential trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.\n\nOptions trader Joseph D'Arrigo works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nA record percentage of investors is also saying companies are \u201coverinvesting,\u201d according to the survey.\n\nThe worry is that all the dollars pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that AI proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.\n\nOther high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price briefly fell below $US90,000 ($138,000) in the morning, down from nearly $US125,000 last month. It later recovered some of its losses and climbed back toward $US93,000.\n\nHome Depot also dragged the market lower after falling 6 per cent.\n\nIt reported a weaker profit for the summer than analysts expected and cited a variety of reasons.\n\nChief among them was a lack of storms, which would have driven customers to buy more home-improvement supplies.\n\nHome Depot chief executive Ted Decker also pointed to \u201cconsumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing\u201d for preventing an expected increase in demand.\n\nReporting stronger profits is one of the ways a company can make its stock price look less expensive, because stock prices tend to track with earnings over the long term.\n\nThat\u2019s raising the stakes for tomorrow's profit report from Nvidia, which could either help halt its stock\u2019s slide or worsen it.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Cloudflare fell 2.8 per cent after an earlier issue at the internet infrastructure provider caused global outages for ChatGPT and other services.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 55.09 points to 6,617.32.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 498.50 to 46,091.74, and the Nasdaq composite sank 275.23 to 22,432.85.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields likewise oscillated through the day.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury eventually eased to 4.11 per cent from 4.13 per cent late Monday.\n\nYields have been swinging amid doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, something that traders had earlier seen as very likely.\n\nWhat the Fed does is critical for the market because stock prices ran to records in part because of expectations for continued cuts to rates.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates twice already this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market.\n\nBut lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and inflation has stubbornly remained above the Fed\u2019s two per cent target.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes tumbled across Europe and Asia.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi sank 3.3 per cent, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped 3.2 per cent and France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 1.9 per cent for some of the world\u2019s larger drops.",

But now it's at the point where it's replacing many of the activities that support healthy development \u2013 like sport, reading, and creative play,\" UniSA researcher and PhD candidate Mason Zhou said.\n\n\"Because these changes happened during a critical stage of adolescence, and because they've persisted three years after COVID restrictions ended, they may have lasting impacts on young people's health and wellbeing \u2013 and that's a real cause for concern.\"\n\nWith the looming implementation of Australia's social media ban for children under 16, the researchers said this study could show where extra support would be needed for younger teens and children.\n\nCo-researcher Professor Dot Dumuid said more programs and policies that encouraged young people to re-engage in enriching activities such as sport, music, arts, and reading were needed.\n\nSport helps boost healthy social development.

(Getty)\n\nAre Black Friday deals really worth it?\n\nThey can be if you shop smart, according to University of Melbourne law professor Jeannie Marie Paterson.\n\nThat means watching out for \ufeffmanipulative advertising tactics like countdowns and timers designed to pressure consumers into overspending.\n\n\"Retailers and marketers want people to buy more than they need,\" Paterson told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"People who run marketing campaigns have studied psychology [and] we need to realise that they know more about us than we know about ourselves, so just beware.\"\n\nHow do retailers create fake or misleading discounts?\n\nThe ACCC has warned retailers it is on high alert for misleading advertising tactics during the Black Friday sales period, including:\n\nadvertising a sale as \ufeff'up to X per cent off' but the 'up to' text is not prominently displayed, or few products are on sale at the advertised rate\n\nusing misleading time representations (e.g. saying sale is for 'X days only', using a countdown timer) that don't reflect the true duration of the sale\n\nclaiming a sale is \ufeffstore-wide or site-wide when some products are excluded\n\nusing fine print or disclaimers to limit \ufeffheadline claims about a sale (e.g. members-only deals)\n\nusing misleading pricing representations that inflate the pre-sale price of a product\n\nPaterson said many of these tactics boil down to creating a misleading sense of pressure for consumers to buy and warned Aussie shoppers to avoid such deals.\ufeff\n\nCompanies caught breaking the rules can face investigations and fines.\n\nMichael Hill, My House and Hairhouse online paid penalties earlier this year for allegedly making false and misleading representations about their Black Friday sales in 2024.\n\nExamples of the type of advertising the ACCC's sweep will focus on. (ACCC)\n\nWhat can I do if I've been misled by false advertising?\n\nBusinesses that mislead consumers through false advertising or claims can be subject to fines and other penalties in Australia.\n\nTo protect yourself from potentially \ufefffalse or misleading advertising, Paterson recommends taking screenshots of online advertisements, product listings, and shopping carts.\n\nIt takes just a few seconds and can provide crucial evidence if you don't get what was promised.\ufeff\n\nIf you think you've been a victim of false advertising, you can \ufeff report it to the ACCC.\n\nIs it legal for stores to inflate prices before a sale?\n\nNo, but that doesn't stop it from happening.\n\nSome retailers \ufeffincrease the price of a product before discounting it, resulting in a sale price that seems better than it really is.\n\nThis is misleading and illegal, but it's hard for consumers to spot unless they were tracking the product's price\ufeff before it went on sale.\n\nSome use \ufeffonline archives like The Wayback Machine to check a product's price history before buying, but it doesn't always work.\n\nIt's better to plan ahead if you want to avoid being duped.\n\n\"Go and do some research on the products you might be interested in first,\" Paterson said.\n\n\"Then when sales times comes, you can shop from an informed position that you're getting the discount you actually think you are.\"\n\nSome Aussies use \ufeffonline archives to check a product's price history before making Black Friday purchases. (Getty)\n\nWhat are the most common Black Friday scams to look out for?\n\nAussies have lost millions to shopping scams already this year and they're currently the most reported scam type involving financial loss in 2025, according to the ACCC.\n\nIt's warning consumers to watch out for these scams over the Black Friday sales period.\ufeff\n\n\"Scammers love Black Friday sales too because they know shoppers are looking for bargains and they rely on creating urgency and pressure that can come with a busy shopping period,\" ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.\n\n\"We remind consumers to take their time, check the legitimacy of websites and its offers, and be cautious about sharing personal or financial information online.\"\n\nShopping scams initiated through fake websites, advertisements, social media, and mobile apps have already resulted in $122 million in losses this year.\n\nPaterson said that if a Black Friday deal sounds \"too good to be true\", it probably is.\n\nShe also issued a specific warning for the \ufeff'ghost store' scam, which has tricked plenty of Aussies out of their hard-earned cash in a matter of minutes.\n\n\ufeff\"Ghost stores are stores that often say they're closing down and selling off their stock, but in fact don't really exist,\" she explained.\n\n\"They're just a scam.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Australia Post reveals deadline for mailing Christmas parcels\n\nAre online deals better than in-store deals?\n\nIt depends on the retailer.\n\nSome retailers offer online-exclusive deals, including discounts that may be better than what they can afford to offer in bricks and mortar stores.\ufeff\n\n\"The overheads for retailers selling online are much lower than selling in store,\" Paterson explained.\n\n\"We also know that people are less likely to return products they buy online.\"\n\nBut she warned that digital deals may come with hidden catches.\n\nFor example, if you order a product from an overseas retailer your consumer protections will be more limited than if you buy from an Australian business.\n\n\"If you buy a product and it's faulty or it doesn't fit, you don't have a lot of return rights,\" Paterson said.\n\nCan I get a refund on a Black Friday sale item?\n\nIt depends.\ufeff\n\nSome retailers say that products bought in Black Friday sales can't be returned, but \ufeffthat doesn't override your consumer rights.\n\n\ufeff\"In Australia we have consumer guarantees, which means you do have a right to a refund or replacement for goods that are faulty,\" Paterson said.\n\n\"But there is no legal right for change of mind returns.\"\ufeff\n\nThe rules also apply to overseas retailers that sell here as Australian law applies to goods sold into Australia, but it may be harder to enforce.\n\nIf in doubt, check the fine print before making purchases in the Black Friday sales.\n\nHave you got a story?

He has been a regular at the White House this year, ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup.\n\nDuring dinner, Mr Trump announced he was designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally as the administration aims to elevate the two nations' military relationship.\n\nThe designation, while largely symbolic, provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defence, trade and security cooperation.\n\nRonaldo sees Saudi crown prince as 'boss'\n\nRonaldo joined football club Al-Nassr at the end of 2022 on a reported $US536.3 million ($865 million) contract.\n\nHe has since signed a two-year extension over the summer for a reported $US710 million, which will keep him with Al-Nassr until at least the 2026-27 season.\n\nAl Nassr signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2022. (Reuters: Ahmed Yosri)\n\nAl-Nassr is majority-owned by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund that the crown prince chairs, and Ronaldo has been the figurehead leading Saudi Arabia's recent investment in its soccer league.\n\nSaudi Arabia teams have invested over $US3 billion into signing some of the best players in the world.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo referred to Prince Mohammed as \"our boss\".\n\nEarlier this month, he appeared at a Ministry of Tourism event in Riyadh where he talked up the kingdom's development projects and his hopes for the 2034 FIFA World Cup being held in Saudi Arabia.\n\nRonaldo's US troubles\n\nIt was a rare US visit for Ronaldo, who has not played in the country since 2014. It is believed he has not visited the country since that time either.\n\nIn 2017, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Ronaldo had paid $US375,000 in hush money to a woman who accused him of raping her at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.\n\nHe denied the claims made by Kathryn Mayorga, saying in a statement made in 2018: \"Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in.\"\n\nIn 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face charges because the claims could not be proven.\n\nABC/Wires",

    "text": "The chief executive of the CSIRO has defended the decision to cut hundreds of jobs, arguing the organisation needs to alter its priorities to remain relevant.\n\nYesterday, Australia's peak science agency said it had reached a \"critical inflection point\" and would need to cut up to 350 jobs.\n\nThose jobs are in addition to more than 800 positions that have already been slashed from the organisation in the past 18 months.\n\nFederal Science Minister Tim Ayres said the cuts were aimed at refocusing the efforts of the CSIRO towards research priorities, such as critical minerals, iron and steel production in Australia.\n\nToday, the CSIRO's chief executive said the cuts were being influenced by two main factors.\n\nCost of living pressure extends to science\n\n\"The first is we're looking at our science portfolio as we always should and asking how we can focus it in the areas where CSIRO can make the biggest impact for the country,\" CSIRO CEO Doug Hilton said.\n\n\" Then the second thing is we're facing a really profound sustainability challenge that's been accumulating probably over 40 years. \"\n\nDr Hilton also defended the government's funding of the organisation, saying its budget had not been cut, but that the cost of conducting research had increased significantly.\n\n\"What's happened over 15 years is the value of the appropriation that we get, the money we get from the government in the budget each year, has gone up by about 1.3 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"The cost of living has gone up by about 2.7 per cent on average each year. And the cost of science has gone up much, much more than that.\"\n\nCSIRO chief executive Doug Hilton says the cost of science has risen along with the cost of living. (Supplied: WEHI)\n\nDr Hilton said the CSIRO had not yet told staff which areas of research would be targeted by the cuts, but they would be informed \"over the next three days in a respectful way\".\n\n\"We take these decisions very seriously and my heart goes out to the staff, not just the ones that are impacted but the broader CSIRO community,\" he said.\n\n\"We work in a lot of different research areas and I think it is appropriate for us every year to look at those areas where we believe we can generate the most impact.\n\n\"And the type of science Australia needs has changed over 50 years. If you think about 10 years ago, no one was talking about AI. Now, we use AI in almost every research area.\n\n\"So the skills of our staff, the mix of our staff, the diversity of disciplines that we bring to bear on big problems needs to evolve.\"\n\nThe organisation employs more than 5,800 people in sites across the country. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nHe also defended the decision to announce the redundancies in the lead-up to Christmas.\n\n\"In order for us to be able to meet our budget in the 2026-27 year we needed to start that process now and I acknowledge that it is a difficult time to start engaging with staff about those things,\" he said.\n\n\"The timing has been driven by a desire to look at our whole research portfolio. We had 300 of our most senior scientists come together in Melbourne in September and we wanted to take the time to consider their input.\"\n\n'It's terrifying'\n\nScience and Technology Australia chief executive Ryan Winn today attributed the job cuts to inflation, saying the problem was affecting the entire sector.\n\n\"I wouldn't put the blame at Doug's feet,\" he told ABC Radio Canberra.\n\n\"This is government not keeping pace with the investment in science as the cost of everything goes up.\n\n\"We're talking 350 jobs. It's great ideas, it's innovations, it's our future.\n\n\"This is a problem that's been growing for everyone.\"\n\nMr Winn said he had been receiving messages from people since yesterday's announcement, anxious about its wider impact.\n\n\"I've had messages from science teachers saying 'How do I convince my kids in my classes to do science now when this is the message government and our sector is sending?'\" he said.\n\n\" It's terrifying. We know that we need more engineers, more scientists, more AI experts ... How do we convince them that there's real jobs here if all they're hearing is about job cuts? \"\n\nMr Winn pointed to research the CSIRO had done that had led the way in science.\n\n\"We have ultra-low gluten-free barley that came out of CSIRO,\" he said.\n\n\"These are amazing ideas that no one else has developed and it's CSIRO that has led these things, so yes, we can do a lot to prioritise and look at how CSIRO can partner with other organisations ... but CSIRO can't do it alone and also universities can't do it alone.\n\n\"We've got a great research sector, we just need to back them.\"",

(Unsplash: Glenn Carstens-Peters)\n\nThis tallies with recent Reserve Bank forecasts in its Statement on Monetary Policy, which also tipped inflation to outpace pay rises for much of 2026.\n\nThis year's pay rise was also stronger for workers in the public sector (3.8 per cent) compared to the private sector (3.2 per cent).\n\nThe head of prices statistics at the ABS, Michelle Marquardt, said those mostly went to state, not federal or local, government employees.\n\n\"State government pay rises contributed 82 per cent of public sector wage growth this quarter,\" Ms Marquardt said.\n\nAbhijit Surya, from Capital Economics, said the relative weakness of private sector pay rises, which were propped up by an increase in minimum and award wages, should comfort the Reserve Bank that wage rises are not a major contributor to inflation pressures.\n\n\"Encouragingly, though, wage growth for workers on individual arrangements, which tends to be more sensitive to cyclical conditions, did ease slightly, from 3.1 per cent to 3 per cent,\" he noted.\n\n\"Looking further ahead, our composite labour market continues to suggest that wage growth will fall to around 3 per cent in the coming quarters, as the [Reserve] Bank is expecting.\n\n\"With productivity growth in the midst of a cyclical rebound, unit labour cost growth should ease in tandem, helping to tame services inflation.\"\n\nWage growth peaked at 4.2 per cent in the December quarter of 2023, after remaining stuck below 2.5 per cent from the start of 2015 to early 2022.\n\nThe Wage Price Index (WPI) measures base pay, and does not include additional payments like overtime and bonuses.\n\nThe ABS published a second set of monthly numbers today, estimating the total wages and salaries paid by employers to their staff in September.\n\nPayments totalled $108.8 billion, driven higher by bonuses in the mining, utilities, retail, media and financial services sectors, which are often paid in September, in response to financial year targets.\n\nHowever, the 5.3 per cent annual growth in total wages and salaries paid to employees was down from the 6.1 per cent rise recorded over the year to September 2024.",

(ABC Sunshine Coast: Jake Kearnan)\n\nShed secretary Jack Menhenik said safety concerns were cited in the eviction notice.\n\n\"Queensland Rail has been really good to us over the last 12 years in this vicinity, which has got three sheds, a communal block, a toilet and kitchen facilities,\" Mr Menhenik said.\n\n\" They're a bit concerned about the safety of the building.

(ABC Sunshine Coast: Jake Kearnan)\n\nAccording to the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ), Gympie's rental vacancy rate currently sits at 1.2 per cent, 0.2 per cent higher than the state average but in line with the national rate of 1.2 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the median house price has more than doubled from $322,000 to $750,000 in the past five years.\n\nIt has made finding a new home difficult.\n\nPresident of the Gympie Men's Shed Markcus Jaques said the members had been working tirelessly to clear out the site.\n\n\"A lot of us have been going home, getting in our lounge chairs, falling asleep and not waking up until the next morning,\" Mr Jaques said.\n\n\"Most of us are over 65, and it's a lot to ask.\n\n\"Some of the blokes reckon I've been getting the whip out.\n\n\"Since we've closed, my phone hasn't stopped ringing from partners and wives saying, 'What am I going to do with my husband now?'\n\nA closing down sale is being held at the old site on Tozer Street.

(ABC Sunshine Coast: Jake Kearnan)\n\nThere were fears the group would lose the money it had raised over the years.\n\n\"We're a not-for-profit organisation \u2026 if we did fold, we would lose that money,\" Mr Menhenik said.\n\n\"That would go to the Australian Men's Shed Association, which is what the constitution says, and there is nothing wrong with that, but \u2026 these guys have done sausage sizzles and sold a heap of equipment to make money for the Gympie Men's Shed.\"\n\nWhile the search for a new home has been unfruitful thus far, the club is hopeful someone will come to the table with a suitable site.\n\nThe group has been working tirelessly to move all its equipment into storage. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jake Kearnan)\n\nEnd of an era\n\nThe club was given a three-month grace period to vacate the premises following the expiry of its lease in June.\n\nQueensland Rail's head of SEQ, Neil Backer, said it was unable to continue the token lease due to site defects.\n\n\"Queensland Rail has been working with the Gympie Men's Shed for several months, and all attempts have been made to find them a new location,\" Mr Backer said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this has not been possible.\"\n\nQueensland Rail will continue to provide the men's group with a shed for storage on site for up to two years while they source a new home.",

    "text": "On Thursday, the people of the Kingdom of Tonga will head to the ballot box for only the fifth general election in its history.\n\nAs the only remaining sovereign monarchy in the Pacific, the Kingdom, as it is known colloquially, is still young democratically, with most of the country's parliament being elected by the people for the first time in 2010.\n\nYet, in spite of the recent \u2014 and long heralded \u2014 milestones of political evolution, there is concern among some that Tonga is, already, slipping back into an autocracy.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is a reversal of democratic changes that happened in 2010,\" said Lopeti Senituli, a political commentator and former advisor to two prime ministers.\n\n\"What we agreed to in 2010 was a power-sharing arrangement between the king and a democratically elected prime minister and cabinet \u2026 that was what we agreed to.\"\n\nLopeti Senituli is concerned by some of the political manouvres being made in Tonga. (ABC News)\n\nThursday's general election occurs less than a year after the former prime minister Siaosi Sovaleni resigned in parliament, just minutes after a motion for a vote of no-confidence was passed against him.\n\nThe public reasons given for the motion were alleged corruption and mismanagement, but there was widespread speculation the motion was the result of a power struggle between the prime minister and King Tupou VI.\n\nJust weeks prior to Sovaleni's resignation, a dispute between the PM and king became public when a letter from Tonga's Royal Palace was leaked, revealing the king's disapproval of Sovaleni's foreign minister at the time, Fekita 'Utoikamanu.\n\nThe letter was later publicly rebuked by Sovaleni. Soon after, Sovaleni was replaced by the now Prime Minister 'Aisake Eke, and parliament passed legislation handing full control of Tonga's foreign affairs to the monarchy, renaming it \"His Majesty's Diplomatic Service\".\n\nMr Senituli said the move was an example of changes being made \"without consulting the public\".\n\nMr Sovaleni himself is on the ballot paper and widely predicted to win his constituency, with the prospect of being re-elected as prime minister a possibility.\n\nMr Senituli believes Mr Sovaleni has a good chance of returning to the top job, while others say the breakdown in relationship with the king leaves him with no chance.\n\nSome, such as Tongan noble representative Lord Tu'ilakepa, go further.\n\nHe believes the prime minister position should be decided by the king, effectively reversing the democratic reforms of 2010.\n\nLord Tu'ilakepa has advocated for more radical changes to Tonga's politics. (ABC News)\n\n\"Let the king choose the prime minister from the 26 MPs,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"If that happens, all these quarrels will stop.\n\n\"Right now, you have individuals lobbying and calling around trying to secure the PM position.\n\n\"What's crucial is for the people's representatives to stand united \u2014 but realistically, they never will. They have different political ideologies.\"\n\nTonga's tough democratic experience\n\nTonga's 15 years as a democracy has been arduous.\n\nIn that short period, four out of five prime ministers have faced a vote of no confidence, 10 MPs have been convicted for corruption and bribery, and at one point, the country's parliament was dissolved for nearly four months.\n\nDespite being recognised as a democracy, Tonga's political system still faces international and domestic criticism for allocating more than a third of parliament seats to \"noble representatives\" \u2014 MPs elected by a pool of just 33 hereditary chiefs and a handful of life peers.\n\nElections in the country have been peaceful and results have been undisputed, but frictions between cabinet and the monarchy and nobles have been ongoing.\n\nThere's a mixed reaction about the balance of powers within Tonga's political system, a system largely based on the United Kingdom's Westminster system \u2014 one which recognises the monarch as the head of state but a government directed by a democratically elected parliament.\n\n\"At the moment the parliament is unable to check itself, so the king has to get involved in the political process,\" said Tevita Motulalo, a long-time journalist and political commentator.\n\n\"I would prefer to have two chamber system with lower and upper house, because there are greater checks in place.\n\n\"The nobles are representatives of their territories and ha'a [tribe] \u2026 it's similar to that of a senator who comes in as representative of a state/province.\"\n\nTongans want better infrastructure and social support\n\nOn the streets of the capital Nuku'alofa, the tension between the palace and the politicians is not front of mind.\n\nAs they head to the ballot box, it's the economy, basic infrastructure, healthcare and crime.\n\n\"The biggest challenge that I'm seeing in my neighbourhood are the poor state of the roads \u2026 they're damaged and full of potholes,\" said one woman in Nuku'alofa.\n\n\"I'm looking to a government that prioritises education, health and security,\" said another.\n\n\"A lot of youth are using drugs \u2026 I feel like the government hasn't done enough for youth,\" said a man in the Tongatapu village of Vaotu'u.\n\nThe ABC spoke to Tongan voters ahead of the 2025 poll to get their views on what would shape their decisions at the ballot box. (ABC News)\n\n\"I will vote for the person who has love for the poor. Like myself, I'm not well off and I'd like someone who helps the poor. One thing I think could be improved is the pension for elderly people, these are the people who worked to build this country.\"\n\nTonga has endured persistent fuel shortages, with hours-long queues being a common sight at petrol stations.\n\nPotholes dot almost every road and a number of resorts have closed down as a result of natural disasters.\n\nThe public sector is suffering from a severe labour shortage due to mass emigration and overseas labour mobility which has seen thousands of Tongans regularly travel to Australia and New Zealand to pick fruit and pack meat.\n\n\"As a single voter issue, democratic reform is no longer centre stage,\" said Mr Motulalo.\n\n\"The majority of the discussions in the election campaigns is about livelihoods, education, health and so forth.\"\n\nThe King 'flexes his muscles' in Tonga Tonga's king has taken control of a government department in what critics say is a 'slap' to democracy in the Pacific nation.\n\nFor long time pro-democracy advocates like Mr Senituli, however, the monarch's increasing influence in the running of the country is worrying.\n\nHe says it could be just one step in the erosion of Tonga's democratic reforms.\n\n\"Now we are slowly witnessing the king re-inserting his executive authority and this is a step backwards,\" he said.\n\n\"This is what I'm worried about, that the democratic changes that we have made are going to be lost.\"",

(AAP Image: Joel Carrett)\n\nMs Wilson was keen to market her arrival as leader as a fresh start for the party, just a year out from the next state election.\n\n\"Yesterday was a line in the sand moment. We have elected a new generational team and a team that represents all walks of life from all across Victoria,\" she said.\n\n\"As a millennial, I'm 35, I understand the pressures of that generation and below, and a lot of it comes back to home ownership.\n\n\"So many young people in Victoria have simply lost hope that they will ever be able to afford their own home, and I want to put forward the policies that restore that hope.\"\n\nSigns the party is still divided on leadership\n\nMs Wilson ousted Mr Battin yesterday after a motion to spill the leadership divided the Liberal Party, 19 votes to 13.\n\nAfter the party voted for the spill, Ms Wilson was elected unopposed.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr Battin offered his full support to the new party leader who would take them to the polls in 2026.\n\n\"Look, I think we've got a really good chance,\" he said.\n\n\"Jess is going to be in a great position to win. We've seen that Victorians really want change, and Jess is the right person now to take us to the next election.\n\n\"Victorians just want to see that the Victorian Liberal Party can deliver. We've already come out with some good policies we'll continue.\"\n\nBrad Battin was dumped after less than a year as Victorian Liberal leader. (ABC News: ABC News)\n\nSenior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at Monash University Zareh Ghazarian said the 19-13 split in the spill vote showed there was still disagreement in the party.\n\n\"This shift to a new leader wasn't unanimous, Brad Battin still did have supporters and there are still going to be divisions within the Liberal party,\" Dr Ghazarian said.\n\n\" It's this weird conundrum where it doesn't necessarily mean that if a leader is popular, they're going to keep their job. \"\n\nDr Ghazarian said the divisions within the party would need to be fixed quickly to avoid the situation repeating.\n\n\"There are 12 months until the next election, which is due this time next year,\" he said.\n\n\"If they are still unable to reconcile their differences, especially between those with more socially conservative views and those with slightly more progressive views, then the party is probably going to be going through this loop regularly.\"\n\nFormer Liberal premier Jeff Kennett called it an \"exciting\" development for the party.\n\n\"This is a generational change, it's a generational change for the Liberal party,\" he said.\n\n\" I think you will find that she'll not only attract young people to her style, but I think she'll also attract a lot of those senior women who have been attracted to the Teals in recent years but who are fundamentally Liberal supporters. \"\n\nFormer premier Jeff Kennett says Ms Wilson represents generational change in the party. (ABC News)\n\nMr Kennett said the party had been bogged down in factional warfare for years, and would benefit from the leadership of a relative \"cleanskin\" to politics.\n\n\"There have been people who have been working to undermine successive leaders,\" he said.\n\n\"The very fact they have, as factions, come together and said we need change \u2026 gives me great hope.\"",

    "text": "Another AFL draft has arrived, offering dozens of teenage footballers the chance to realise their dreams and clubs the opportunity to prepare for a brighter future.\n\nThe draft can be a complicated beast these days, with academies and father-son selections muddying the waters for clubs looking to secure the best talent.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the 2025 AFL draft and tap here for a rundown of every pick for each team.\n\nWhen is the AFL draft?\n\nThe 2025 AFL draft will be held over two nights on Wednesday, November 19 and Thursday, November 20.\n\nThe first round will be completed tonight, when a selection of players will be present at Docklands Stadium for the event.\n\nThe rest of the draft will be held on the second night. In total, 50 to 60 players are expected to be drafted this year.\n\nHow can I follow the AFL draft?\n\nABC Sport will have live blogs running on both nights of the draft, bringing you news and analysis of every pick.\n\nThe draft will also be broadcast live on Fox Footy and Kayo Sports.\n\nWhat time is the AFL draft?\n\nBoth nights of the draft will start at 7pm AEDT.\n\nHere are the corresponding times for other regions of Australia.\n\n6:30pm ACDT: South Australia\n\nSouth Australia 6pm AEST: Queensland\n\nQueensland 5:30pm ACST : Northern Territory\n\n: Northern Territory 4pm AWST: Western Australia\n\nWho are the players I should know before the draft?\n\nIt is widely expected that Willem Duursma \u2014 the fourth Duursma sibling to join the AFL/AFLW system \u2014 will be taken by West Coast with the first selection on Wednesday night.\n\nWillem Duursma is set to be the number one pick at this year's draft. (Getty Images: Paul Kane)\n\nOthers in the top-five mix are Zeke Uwland and Dylan Patterson (both members of Gold Coast's academy), Daniel Annable (a member of Brisbane's academy) and Harry Dean (a Carlton father-son).\n\nFrom the open pool of players available to all, Cooper Duff-Tytler, Sullivan Robey, Xavier Taylor, Sam Cumming and Dyson Sharp are the strongest top-10 candidates.\n\nWhat is the current order of picks in the first round?\n\nWest Coast West Coast Richmond Richmond Essendon Essendon Melbourne Melbourne Carlton Hawthorn Carlton GWS West Coast Western Bulldogs Gold Coast Adelaide Brisbane Gold Coast Geelong Fremantle Essendon Hawthorn Brisbane\n\nHow does the bidding system work in the AFL draft?\n\nThe AFL assigns each draft pick with a points value. The first pick in the draft has the most value, with 3,000 points, and the points value of each pick decreases all the way down until pick 54, the final pick of the third round, which is worth 14 points. Any picks from then onwards have no points value.\n\nBrisbane will swiftly match a bid for academy prospect Daniel Annable. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nThe points system is in place for two reasons: to require clubs to pay for matching bids on father-son prospects or academy prospects that are tipped to go high up in any given draft year.\n\nTeams who match bids for either a father-son or academy prospect get a 20 per cent discount. Teams are not obligated to match bids from other clubs, therefore allowing the player to be drafted by a different club.\n\nCan teams do trades during the draft?\n\nThey sure can!\n\nSince being introduced in 2018, the ability for teams to trade during the draft has added an extra wrinkle to the whole process.\n\nTeams can trade with each other using their own picks in the current draft as well as using picks in the 2026 or 2027 drafts.\n\nWhat is the father-son rule?\n\nThe father-son rule is one that is unique to the AFL and allows family traditions to be carried through generations.\n\nSimply put, if a player makes 100 or more appearances for a single club, then that same club has the right to draft the player's son.\n\nThere have been some famous father-son combinations to have played in VFL/AFL history, perhaps none more famous than Gary Ablett and Gary Ablett Jr, who both played for Geelong.\n\nTeams are not obligated to select a player under the father-son rule either. A famous example of this occurred in the 2015 draft when the Sydney Swans opted against drafting Josh Dunkley \u2014 now a three-time premiership player \u2014 whose father, Andrew, played 217 games for the club.",

(ABC News: Chloe Henville)\n\nIt was sparked by a landmark Supreme Court decision in July, ruling that the Shire of Mount Magnet, about 570 kilometres north-east of Perth, could levy rates on a mining camp covered by \"miscellaneous licences\".\n\nMiscellaneous licences are typically levied on land with mining infrastructure, such as access roads and accommodation sites.\n\nSwift reforms followed\n\nThe ruling opened the door for other local governments to scrutinise miscellaneous licence holders, a move which the mining sector said could cost it $55 million a year.\n\nThe mining camp owner, Atlantic Vanadium, said it would appeal the decision.\n\nMeanwhile, the WA Labor government swiftly announced reforms to the act, which were welcomed by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA.\n\nThe WA government is looking to exempt land under miscellaneous licences from rates. (ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)\n\nToo swiftly, according to Ms Cable.\n\n\"The speed of this bill, the complete lack of consultation, the disregard, the amazing disregard for the impact on our small regional community,\" she said.\n\nThe amendment would require any rates collected on miscellaneous licensed land since 2017 to be repaid within 28 days.\n\n\"If we are to repay the money that we have rated, it would halve our reserves,\" Ms Cable said.\n\nWith 580 residents, Ms Cable said taking away the income source would make the shire economically unviable.\n\n\"We're not a dysfunctional, malfunctioning local government,\" Ms Cable said.\n\n\"This is not a small local government trying to gouge the mining industry\n\n\"But we need regular, budgetable, reliable, non-discretionary revenue.\"\n\nThe Shire of Mount Magnet has been fighting to charge rates on occupied Crown land. (ABC News: Chloe Henville)\n\nBill 'heavy-handed', says opposition\n\nShadow Local Government Minister Kirrilee Warr likened the legislative reform to a \"David and Goliath\" battle against small regional councils.\n\nMs Warr said the local government sector was not properly consulted, with less than a week to respond to the state before the \"heavy-handed\" bill was publicly announced.\n\n\"[That] is certainly not adequate time when we are working within the bureaucracy of any level of government,\" Ms Warr said.\n\nThe WA Nationals pushed the state to amend the proposed bill and write in compensation through a revitalised Royalties for Regions scheme for affected councils, but the changes were not adopted.\n\nKirrilee Warr says impacted shires should be financially supported. (ABC News: Chloe Henville)\n\nMs Warr said the bill would also undermine the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n\"We must respect the separation of powers,\" Ms Warr said.\n\n\"When did it become our place to start saying, 'Sorry, courts, we don't believe what you've just read and interpreted and said, and we want you to go and change that?'\n\n\"I am gobsmacked by that.\"\n\nReturn to the status quo\n\nLocal Government Minister Hannah Beazley did not respond directly to questions about whether the amendment contradicted the court's decision.\n\nBut she said the state government had introduced \"sensible and effective law reform\" following the Supreme Court ruling and restored the \"long-held understanding\" that miscellaneous licensed land was not rateable.\n\nHannah Beazley says the bill would uphold the status quo. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nMs Beazley said councils would not be hurt by the amendment.\n\n\"Local governments are not being financially disadvantaged by the proposed change to the legislation since the land has only been rateable since the Supreme Court decision in July,\" she said.\n\n\"This land was never intended as a revenue stream for local governments.\"\n\nMs Beazley said, if passed, the bill would provide clarity and uphold the status quo.\n\nThe amendment has been read twice in the state's upper house, but has not been formally adopted.\n\nThere are eight sitting days left in the upper house for this year.",

    "text": "When Campbell Chesser secured his trade from West Coast to Carlton, a gaping hole in the West Coast Eagles' list profile was brought into sharp focus.\n\nThe club only has one player either selected with, or traded in exchange for, a first-round draft pick between 2015 and 2021 on its books.\n\nCampbell Chesser's move to Carlton leaves West Coast without another first-round draft pick. (AFL Photos via Getty Images: Daniel Carson)\n\nIn fact, just eight players recruited in that time remain at the club.\n\nA lot is made of the Tim Kelly move, which saw the midfielder arrive from Geelong for first-round picks in 2019 and 2020.\n\nIt was that move which, when it didn't translate to another premiership, contributed to the dire position the club finds itself in now.\n\nBut it's not the sole decision the Eagles have made in their recruitment which, in 2025, saw them produce a calamity never seen before in VFL/AFL history \u2014 22 losses in a single season.\n\nLet me be clear \u2014 that is not a dig at Kelly.\n\nTim Kelly came to West Coast in exchange for a raft of high picks. (AAP Image: Richard Wainwright)\n\nHe didn't dictate his trade value, and in his early years at the club was among its best players, acknowledged by his 2023 John Worsfold Medal, and runner-up finish in 2022.\n\nWhat it highlights is a list management strategy that hasn't paid off, and picks which haven't translated to long-term talent.\n\nA brief history of picks\n\nWhen West Coast won the 2018 premiership, it did so with eight first-round picks in its match-day squad, along with three others in Andrew Gaff, Nic Naitanui and Brad Sheppard on its list.\n\nJarrod Brander also played a game that year, after being pick 13 in the 2017 draft.\n\nCompared to the 12 first rounders who played a game in 2018, the 2025 Eagles had just seven, with all but Liam Duggan and Tom Cole drafted since 2021.\n\nLiam Duggan was one of seven first-round draft picks who played a game for West Coast in 2025. (AAP Image: Jono Searle)\n\nThat's reflected in the age profile of West Coast. Its premiership side had an average age of 26 with 2657 games between them.\n\nThe side that played in round 24 this season, which didn't include the injured Harley Reid, had an average age of 23 and with a thousand fewer games of experience.\n\nThe point here is twofold. It shows the Eagles are still very much at the beginning of the rebuild, and that this upcoming draft is critical for the club's future.\n\nWhat is a successful draft?\n\nQuantifying draft success is very difficult. Is it total games played by any given draft year? Premierships? Individual accolades? According to Draftguru, West Coast's 2005 draft is the best ever on record, by games played.\n\nIt was the draft that landed Matt Priddis and Shannon Hurn, and yielded an average of 136 games per player selected.\n\nThat figure is clearly skewed by the 573 games played by Hurn and Priddis, but considering Steven Armstrong was in the Eagles' 2006 premiership side, and Matt Spangher went on to win a flag with Hawthorn, it was a very good draft.\n\nShannon Hurn and Matt Priddis were outstanding draft picks for West Coast, with Hurn a premiership captain and Priddis a Brownlow medallist. (AAP Image: Richard Wainwright)\n\nCould Willem Duursma, widely tipped to be the draft\u2019s first pick, have a similar impact as those two club greats?\n\nWill he stay the journey and commit to the Eagles\u2019 rebuild long term?\n\nAnd who will they opt to take with pick two?\n\nAFL draft club by club: Every team's picks and potential targets With the AFL draft just around the corner, see which picks each club has to work with and the players they could select.\n\nRuckman/forward Cooper Duff-Tytler is predicted to be the second pick, and the ruck position has haunted West Coast since the breakdown and retirement of Nic Naitanui.\n\nBut the midfield needs bolstering too, and that could see the Eagles making a move out of left field.\n\nNext Generation Academy prospects Tylah Williams and Koby Evans could also receive bids, as well as potential father-son recruit Charlie Banfield, who may end up in blue and gold like his dual-premiership winning father Drew.\n\nThe Eagles' draft lotto ticket currently reads picks 1, 2, 13, 34 and 41.\n\nWe all know the odds of hitting the jackpot aren't great, but three and a supp would be a win for Eagles fans.\n\nIt\u2019s a draft full of huge questions for West Coast, and the answers won\u2019t be known for years.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size There are two stories Judith Nangala Crispin tells about her solo journeys criss-crossing the central Australian deserts on a motorcycle with her mongrel dingo Moon on the back. One is a blog that aims to empower women. It covers just one of the 37 crossings she made, and it\u2019s full of adventure and drama. Right from the start, her Suzuki DR650 bike had tyre trouble, and she was stranded for two days in the middle of nowhere. She battled through a desert heatwave, floods, hundreds of kilometres of potholes, corrugations and ruts. Worst of all, Moon was bitten by a snake, and she drove for seven hours through the lightning-streaked night to a vet in Katherine, convinced that Moon would die on the way. Luckily, he survived and they both got safely to the end of the journey at Canberra. The second story about her desert odyssey enters an entirely different visionary world of star maps, spider threads and UFOs in the sky, the spirits of dead animals ascending and a quest to find a caravan of dog-headed beings with bodies made of stars. These are some of the astonishing phenomena explored in Crispin\u2019s illustrated verse novel, The Dingo\u2019s Noctuary (a noctuary is a night diary). \u201cZoe descends to comfort her daughters, in a burning country\u201d. Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin Crispin\u2019s motorcycle odyssey came to a sad end during her 37th journey. She was driving through Broken Hill when \u201cI was run over by a mum shouting at her kids in a gigantic SUV\u201d. She was left with a traumatic brain injury and damage to 126 muscles down her spine. \u201cThe book was only half finished, but I had this terrible sensitivity to light from the computer, it gave me blinding headaches.\u201d So she wrote the second half of The Dingo\u2019s Noctuary on a 1966 Olympia Splendid 33 travel typewriter. \u201cIt transported me back to when I was 15 and thought I was going to grow up to be Gertrude Stein.\u201d This is the third book from the acclaimed poet. It\u2019s a big handsome hardback that took more than seven years to complete, and it\u2019s already won or been shortlisted for poetry, art and photography awards even before publication. The poetry alternates with prose, hand-drawn maps, plant pressings and 47 Lumachrome glass prints of dead animals and birds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe book is about what I found,\u201d Crispin says. \u201cAs a person with mixed heritage and Aboriginal ancestry but without any cultural authority, acceptance or ties, what relationship could I have directly with country that\u2019s not just a platitude? It took 37 trips to feel I knew enough about country and people and myself to write anything meaningful.\u201d Crispin is a descendant of Bpangerang people from the Murray River, and she also acknowledges heritage from Scotland, Ireland, France, Mali, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. She spent more than 20 years searching for her grandmother\u2019s history, hoping it would make her feel she was \u201ca legitimate Aboriginal person\u201d. But it was a rough search. \u201cI\u2019d known we had Aboriginal ancestry since I was a child. We were all told this is something you never talk about, my grandmother and mother were very emphatic,\u201d she says. \u201cTerrible things would happen to the family if you said anything \u2026 There is very little on the white record for some people because the families try so hard to cover it up. I was feeling increasingly illegitimate, I didn\u2019t belong to white culture or Black culture, and I thought, do I keep going on?\u201d One of Crispin\u2019s Lumachrome glass prints, \u201cEnid, connected to Earth by zodiacal light - spider-strings in the old language, the umbilicus of Country.\u201d Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin Along the way she met many \u201cdespairing\u201d people on the same quest. \u201cI wanted this book to be for them. You can walk out on the land and form your own relationship. You don\u2019t have to walk through life feeling like half a person because you don\u2019t have your heritage papers in order.\u201d By the time she discovered her link to the Bpangerang people, she had already spent 15 years living with the Warlpiri people in the Northern Territory. She worked for PAW, the remote Indigenous media organisation, mentoring, working with an app for suicide prevention and with the painters: \u201cIt was the painters who were trying to free me from dogma.\u201d The Warlpiri are her adopted people and she took their skin name Nangala as a sign of respect. \u2018One clear night, Lilian followed the Milky Way out toward Orion.

Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeloved Warlpiri friends and mentors appear often in The Dingo\u2019s Noctuary, and she has given them their own voices. One of them is Lily, \u201cone of the most miraculous people I\u2019ve ever met\u201d. She lived in a humpy until she was 98, and at over 100 she was taken to a nursing home with dementia. The first time Crispin visited her there, Lily had decided she was a new mum to an Aboriginal baby doll and a couple of toys. She was having trouble breastfeeding them, so Crispin got her a bottle. Lily told her many stories: one was about a mountain, and if you went past it, you would find dog-headed people with bodies made of stars. Crispin honoured her stories and made them a feature of her journey: \u201cI told Moon those stories when I was driving him to the vet, trying not to be a complete nervous wreck.\u201d She knew she wanted to talk about the land and people as they were, without romanticising, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want the book to have this weight of suffering and poverty and hopelessness. It\u2019s about the love that people out in the desert have for that place, and the love I had, which came through being able to see what they saw.\u201d The Warlpiri women taught her that a woman can stand up strong after birth, and at death too, grief-stricken but not shattered. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d try and honour the dead, starting small with animals and plants and work my way up.\u201d Crispin and Moon on their motorbike. Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin The first roadkill she collected for her portraits was a tiger snake. The process of decay gave out a light that exposed the image on the page. The images can be put in an art gallery and honoured the way we honour saints in a church, she says. \u201cI portrayed them as ascending back to their ancestors in the sky. I sat with more than 500 cadavers as they bloated up and broke down and then buried them. There\u2019s a smell, but you can ignore it. And the rest feels kind of holy.\u201d T\n\nAdvertisement",

Her mother\u2019s emptied tip jar and the Puccini box set on the dresser are \u201ca marriage of art and sacrifice\u201d that literally saves her nine-year-old life.\n\nThe outer world she describes as her struggling family bounces between Philadelphia apartments is no less heightened. \u201cI was happy there observing the last vestiges of the 1940s, soon to succumb to modern times,\u201d she writes. \u201cThere were horse-drawn wagons, the iceman, a ragman, and an organ grinder with a monkey with a little red cap.\u201d\n\nPatti Smith in 1969. Credit: Norman Seeff\n\nShe\u2019ll return to the loss of that paradise later, but her spirit world never falters, even as she trades up her mother\u2019s devotion to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for Picasso, Modigliani and Sargent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \u201cI believed in the Creator, the many tongues of nature, the moral lessons of fairytales, the language of trees, and the clay of the earth \u2026 God, the infinite realm, Jesus, the human bridge, the artist, the material mouthpiece,\u201d she writes. Breadcrumbs are everywhere: animals, constellations, fragments of ancient alphabets.\n\nA teenage pregnancy and a broken family nest hurl her towards New York, and the part of her story fans will know. Mapplethorpe, Shepard and the Chelsea Hotel; Dylan and Burroughs and Lenny Kaye, terrain that crisscrosses her earlier books from fresh angles. \u201cClaiming the right to create without apology from a stance beyond gender or social definition\u201d is one of her cascading manifestos.",

Source: AAP / Dean Lewins The technology had proven accurate to within one or two years, and users could correct results by sharing government-issued identification, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We decided that simply going with age-estimation was the path of least friction and the path that provided the best outcome and that minimised the collection of personal information,\" Kaufman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in 2025, politicians called for Roblox to fall under Australia's social media age ban, but Inman Grant confirmed it would be exempt, as would services such as the social chat platform Discord and the games marketplace Steam.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its chat feature, Roblox was not a social media platform, Kaufman said, but he hoped its changes would lift online standards.\n\n\n\nRoblox age restrictions will be required for users in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands in December before a global expansion in January 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reforms come as the firm faces more than 35 lawsuits in the US, including allegations it allowed child sexual exploitation on its platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nNine online platforms will fall under Australia's Online Safety Amendment Act , including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, when it comes into effect on 10 December.\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking support can ring Lifeline crisis support on 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14, Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged 5 to 25).

    "text": "Less than two hours by ferry from the grit and gridlock of megacity Jakarta, Pari Island seems almost too good to be true.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indonesian capital's 10 million people are swapped for just 1,500. Children spend all day playing barefoot on sandy white beaches, as pristine turquoise seas lap around them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you notice the swing sets and picnic tables peeking out of the water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During high tides or tidal floods, the water comes right into the house, up to about here,\" explains local man Arif Pujianto, pointing to decaying kitchen cabinets inside his home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can still see the marks. It left all this damage, made things rot and fall apart.\"\n\n\n\nArif Pujianto has lived in this house 50 metres from the shore since he was a small boy. He says it now fills with water at least twice a year. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart Locals say life on this island was steady for generations, but over the past decade, it has undergone a dramatic transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalists monitoring Pari Island say 11 per cent of it has already been swallowed by the sea, with some projecting the entire island will be underwater by 2050. All around the shore, structures that used to sit on land are now permanently submerged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is my island,\" Pujianto says.\n\n\n\nThe place I've lived since I was a child, the place both my parents are buried.\n\n\"Other small islands have already started disappearing. If that ever happens,\" he says, before trailing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really hope it doesn't. That's why I filed this lawsuit.\"\n\n\n\nDemanding compensation\n\nIt is difficult to name a place that has contributed less to human-induced climate change than Pari Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not a single car in operation; the community grows and catches much of their own food; they've even planted thousands of carbon-capturing mangroves along the coastline in a bid to protect it from further erosion.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet it's one of the places in Indonesia where the effects of climate change are being felt most acutely.\n\n\n\n\n\nRising tides have damaged homes, warming waters have ruined once-lucrative seaweed farms, and rapidly changing weather patterns have made fishing largely unprofitable.\n\n\n\nThe community are now demanding damages, having launched a landmark legal case against Swiss cement giant Holcim over its historic carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We studied this for a long time before finally choosing them, because their emissions are among the highest in the world,\" one of four plaintiffs, Ibu Asmania, says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The warming we feel now is caused by the massive emissions they've been producing since the 1950s.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cement industry accounts for around 8 per cent of global carbon emissions annually, mostly due to the extreme heat needed to produce clinker (the main ingredient in cement).\n\n\n\n\n\nHolcim, worth more than $75 billion, is the industry's biggest player.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking about $6,800 each, arguing Holcim is responsible for 0.42 per cent of all global emissions since 1950 and should therefore pay for the same proportion of the damage caused to Pari Island (equivalent to $27,200 of a total $6,476,190 in emissions-related damage).\n\n\n\nIbu Asmania and her husband Sartono run a small seaweed farm off the coast of Pari Island. But rising tea temperatures are bleaching their crops. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart \"What we're demanding first is for Holcim to cut its emissions, and secondly, to repair the environmental damage on Pari Island, through restoration, disaster mitigation, mangrove replanting and building wave barriers,\" Asmania says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would mean our sea could recover, the fish could come back, and the whole ecosystem could heal again.\"\n\n\n\nAn ecosystem in turmoil\n\nAsmania and her husband, Sartono, have operated a small seaweed farm just off the coast of Pari Island for 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost every family on the island used to farm seaweed, but today she says only five are still trying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At first, we thought the seaweed had some kind of disease. It starts turning white from the tips, then the whole branch turns white, decays and rots. And then it spreads to the other seaweed nearby, one by one, until everything gets damaged,\" she explains.\n\n\n\nBut later we learned that it's actually because of climate change. It's because of the increasing sea temperature.\n\nThe community's other main source of income \u2014 fishing \u2014 has not been spared the impacts either.\n\n\n\n\n\nBang Bobby is another plaintiff in the Holcim case. He remembers first going out to sea with his parents in his fifth year of primary school. Now 53 years old, he has been fishing the waters off Pari Island ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We could still predict the seasons back then, including the wind directions month to month,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nBang Bobby has been fishing the waters off Pari Island since he was 10 years old. He says changing weather patterns are driving fish away from the island. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart \"During the easterly winds around August, we'd catch tuna mackerel and scads. Then, as the seasons shifted to westerlies around March or April, we'd catch Spanish mackerel, baby tuna, and lots of others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we can't predict nature anymore. Every forecast is completely off.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby says fish populations near the island have declined, which means local fishers need to travel much further out to sea to find their daily catch.\n\n\n\nImagine a big basin filled with water. If you drop even a small stone into it, it still creates ripples and waves that reach everywhere. It's the same with emissions. Bang Bobby\n\nDuring the region's eight-month-long wet season, when storms are sudden and intense, they often need to turn back before catching anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference in Bobby's income is dramatic; he used to turn a profit of around $500-$600 per month, but now, he is lucky to make $150.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is something we have to do. Even though Pari Island is far from Holcim's factories, the emissions they produce have caused the climate change that's reached us here,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Imagine a big basin filled with water. If you drop even a small stone into it, it still creates ripples and waves that reach everywhere. It's the same with emissions. You can't see them with your eyes, but their impact is real and we can feel it.\"\n\n\n\nLandmark legal battle\n\nNo community has ever successfully sued a corporation on another continent over its carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Peruvian farmer spent the better part of a decade trying to launch a lawsuit against German energy giant RWE, arguing its carbon emissions contributed to glacial flooding in his hometown, but a German court rejected his case in May.\n\n\n\nActivists at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, which is helping the Pari Island community with its legal case, say that if it is successful, it could set an important precedent for other communities seeking climate justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that emissions, and therefore the climate crisis, cannot be contained within administrative borders,\" the forum\u2019s head of monitoring Mas Bagus says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of course, other corporations should also be held accountable. We invite others to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today it's Holcim, tomorrow it could be other companies that must also take responsibility.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pari Island plaintiffs travelled to Switzerland in September to make their case with a local court in the town of Zug, where Holcim is headquartered. They're now awaiting the court's decision on whether to consider their complaint.\n\n\n\nPari Island man Edi Mulyono says he is taking Holcim to court to protect his children's futures. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart In a statement to SBS News, a Holcim spokesperson said: \"In our opinion, the question of who is allowed to emit how much CO2 is a matter for the legislature and not a question for a civil court.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We await the court's decision, yet regardless of the outcome, Holcim is fully committed to reaching net zero by 2050.\"\n\n\n\nBy then, the people of Pari Island fear it will be too late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how long I'll live; maybe I'll die tomorrow, but I've got three kids; the eldest is in high school, the youngest is still in kindergarten,\" says Edi Mulyono, the fourth plaintiff in the case against Holcim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I fear most is what will happen when my children grow up and have their own kids. Where will they live if this island keeps eroding and disappearing because of coastal abrasion and tidal floods?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's what's always on my mind. That's why I'm still doing everything I can to protect this island from sinking.\"\n\n\n\n",

Yep. Very raw, very upsetting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBianca Jones and her friend Holly Bowles died after consuming drinks laced with methanol at a backpackers\u2019 hostel in the tourist town of Vang Vieng last November.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were just 19.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow their parents want other young people to know the dangers that come with travelling - and drinking alcohol - overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolly's mother Sam Bowles says they want to connect with other parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It resonates with us. What we're trying to do is just get the message out to keep other travellers safe\" The families are at the centre of a new safety campaign targetting school leavers, launched by the federal government at Melbourne airport's international departure lounge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBianca and Holly were so excited about travelling overseas together. When Bianca first raised it with Mark and I, we were a little cautious, but also knew that travelling overseas with Holly was something that they had wanted to do and we were all confident about them traveling together. They were smart and they knew how to look after themselves.\" The campaign provides teens and parents with practical advice on drinking in moderation, looking after friends, and the risks posed by unlabelled, cheap or suspicious drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Be wary about consuming spirits and liqueur-based drinks such as cocktails on the rocks, buckets, and shots.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also guidance on how to get help if and when things do go wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's backed by the SmartTraveller website and not-for-profit group Drinkwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nMessaging will include promotional events at airport departure lounges, and geotargeted advertisements reaching mobile phones, as DrinkWise CEO Simon Strahan explains.\n\n\n\n\" They'll be seeing those messages in and around airports. They'll be seeing those messages on social media when they're searching for bars. It'll come up as part of that search activity. In Australia, we'll have those messages in liquor stores as well. We've got activations, that will be in airports, part of that will be actually engaging with school leavers, give them some merchandise, current reminders, and really start to talk to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the end of the year fast approaching, the campaign is ramping up ahead of schoolies celebrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of students are expected to travel locally and overseas, to popular party destinations like Bali, Fiji, the Gold Coast, and south-east Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare says the campaign is about reaching teenagers - wherever they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to have fun and we want them to be safe. We want them to come home safe, and that's fundamentally what this campaign is all about - information online, on the plane, in the airport, text message, social media, but also getting information to schools.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a lengthy investigation by police in Laos and pressure from Australian authorities, no charges have yet been laid over the deaths of Bianca and Holly.\n\n\n\nMichelle Jones and Sam Bowles remember their daughters' excitement as they embarked on their adventure, but they are urging parents to talk to their children about remaining vigilant.\n\n\n\n\n\nMICHELLE JONES: \"Parents should have the conversation and sit them down, before they go away.\"\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size There are two stories Judith Nangala Crispin tells about her solo journeys criss-crossing the central Australian deserts on a motorcycle with her mongrel dingo Moon on the back. One is a blog that aims to empower women. It covers just one of the 37 crossings she made, and it\u2019s full of adventure and drama. Right from the start, her Suzuki DR650 bike had tyre trouble, and she was stranded for two days in the middle of nowhere. She battled through a desert heatwave, floods, hundreds of kilometres of potholes, corrugations and ruts. Worst of all, Moon was bitten by a snake, and she drove for seven hours through the lightning-streaked night to a vet in Katherine, convinced that Moon would die on the way. Luckily, he survived and they both got safely to the end of the journey at Canberra. The second story about her desert odyssey enters an entirely different visionary world of star maps, spider threads and UFOs in the sky, the spirits of dead animals ascending and a quest to find a caravan of dog-headed beings with bodies made of stars. These are some of the astonishing phenomena explored in Crispin\u2019s illustrated verse novel, The Dingo\u2019s Noctuary (a noctuary is a night diary). \u201cZoe descends to comfort her daughters, in a burning country\u201d. Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin Crispin\u2019s motorcycle odyssey came to a sad end during her 37th journey. She was driving through Broken Hill when \u201cI was run over by a mum shouting at her kids in a gigantic SUV\u201d. She was left with a traumatic brain injury and damage to 126 muscles down her spine. \u201cThe book was only half finished, but I had this terrible sensitivity to light from the computer, it gave me blinding headaches.\u201d So she wrote the second half of The Dingo\u2019s Noctuary on a 1966 Olympia Splendid 33 travel typewriter. \u201cIt transported me back to when I was 15 and thought I was going to grow up to be Gertrude Stein.\u201d This is the third book from the acclaimed poet. It\u2019s a big handsome hardback that took more than seven years to complete, and it\u2019s already won or been shortlisted for poetry, art and photography awards even before publication. The poetry alternates with prose, hand-drawn maps, plant pressings and 47 Lumachrome glass prints of dead animals and birds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe book is about what I found,\u201d Crispin says. \u201cAs a person with mixed heritage and Aboriginal ancestry but without any cultural authority, acceptance or ties, what relationship could I have directly with country that\u2019s not just a platitude? It took 37 trips to feel I knew enough about country and people and myself to write anything meaningful.\u201d Crispin is a descendant of Bpangerang people from the Murray River, and she also acknowledges heritage from Scotland, Ireland, France, Mali, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. She spent more than 20 years searching for her grandmother\u2019s history, hoping it would make her feel she was \u201ca legitimate Aboriginal person\u201d. But it was a rough search. \u201cI\u2019d known we had Aboriginal ancestry since I was a child. We were all told this is something you never talk about, my grandmother and mother were very emphatic,\u201d she says. \u201cTerrible things would happen to the family if you said anything \u2026 There is very little on the white record for some people because the families try so hard to cover it up. I was feeling increasingly illegitimate, I didn\u2019t belong to white culture or Black culture, and I thought, do I keep going on?\u201d One of Crispin\u2019s Lumachrome glass prints, \u201cEnid, connected to Earth by zodiacal light - spider-strings in the old language, the umbilicus of Country.\u201d Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin Along the way she met many \u201cdespairing\u201d people on the same quest. \u201cI wanted this book to be for them. You can walk out on the land and form your own relationship. You don\u2019t have to walk through life feeling like half a person because you don\u2019t have your heritage papers in order.\u201d By the time she discovered her link to the Bpangerang people, she had already spent 15 years living with the Warlpiri people in the Northern Territory. She worked for PAW, the remote Indigenous media organisation, mentoring, working with an app for suicide prevention and with the painters: \u201cIt was the painters who were trying to free me from dogma.\u201d The Warlpiri are her adopted people and she took their skin name Nangala as a sign of respect. \u2018One clear night, Lilian followed the Milky Way out toward Orion. All her life she had stared up at Betelgeuse, the giant red star, and felt it staring back\u2019: Crispin\u2019s Lumachrome Glass Print and chemigram of roadkill Australian Masked Owl. Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeloved Warlpiri friends and mentors appear often in The Dingo\u2019s Noctuary, and she has given them their own voices. One of them is Lily, \u201cone of the most miraculous people I\u2019ve ever met\u201d. She lived in a humpy until she was 98, and at over 100 she was taken to a nursing home with dementia. The first time Crispin visited her there, Lily had decided she was a new mum to an Aboriginal baby doll and a couple of toys. She was having trouble breastfeeding them, so Crispin got her a bottle. Lily told her many stories: one was about a mountain, and if you went past it, you would find dog-headed people with bodies made of stars. Crispin honoured her stories and made them a feature of her journey: \u201cI told Moon those stories when I was driving him to the vet, trying not to be a complete nervous wreck.\u201d She knew she wanted to talk about the land and people as they were, without romanticising, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want the book to have this weight of suffering and poverty and hopelessness. It\u2019s about the love that people out in the desert have for that place, and the love I had, which came through being able to see what they saw.\u201d The Warlpiri women taught her that a woman can stand up strong after birth, and at death too, grief-stricken but not shattered. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d try and honour the dead, starting small with animals and plants and work my way up.\u201d Crispin and Moon on their motorbike. Credit: Judith Nangala Crispin The first roadkill she collected for her portraits was a tiger snake. The process of decay gave out a light that exposed the image on the page. The images can be put in an art gallery and honoured the way we honour saints in a church, she says. \u201cI portrayed them as ascending back to their ancestors in the sky. I sat with more than 500 cadavers as they bloated up and broke down and then buried them. There\u2019s a smell, but you can ignore it. And the rest feels kind of holy.\u201d T\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Her earliest memories shimmer as if through a looking glass in the back of a wardrobe: the doll rescued from a cliff; the maple bureau whose knobs are dials to infinity; the rat-infested underworld she patrols with the neighbourhood children; old Aggie across the hall with her dark green book of Irish fairytales.\n\nIt\u2019s a spark poets and songwriters know well: sound as the seed of a world more felt than understood. In this latest in her series of gloriously transporting memoirs, Smith follows that scratch into the awkwardness and beauty of childhood, the place where \u201cthe kingdom of the infinite imagination\u201d first opened beneath her feet.\n\nThe crumb trail begins at once. \u201cThe pen scratches across the page rebel hump rebel hump rebel hump. What do those words mean, asks the pen. I don\u2019t know, says the wrist.\u201d That\u2019s the bread of angels: the mundane summoning the mystical. Patti Smith is the go-between, setting the vibration to language, trusting meaning will come.\n\n\u201cMine was a Proustian childhood, one of intermittent quarantine and convalescence,\u201d she writes. A dose of Asian flu intensifies her insistence on divine structure. Her mother\u2019s emptied tip jar and the Puccini box set on the dresser are \u201ca marriage of art and sacrifice\u201d that literally saves her nine-year-old life.\n\nThe outer world she describes as her struggling family bounces between Philadelphia apartments is no less heightened. \u201cI was happy there observing the last vestiges of the 1940s, soon to succumb to modern times,\u201d she writes. \u201cThere were horse-drawn wagons, the iceman, a ragman, and an organ grinder with a monkey with a little red cap.\u201d\n\nPatti Smith in 1969. Credit: Norman Seeff\n\nShe\u2019ll return to the loss of that paradise later, but her spirit world never falters, even as she trades up her mother\u2019s devotion to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for Picasso, Modigliani and Sargent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \u201cI believed in the Creator, the many tongues of nature, the moral lessons of fairytales, the language of trees, and the clay of the earth \u2026 God, the infinite realm, Jesus, the human bridge, the artist, the material mouthpiece,\u201d she writes. Breadcrumbs are everywhere: animals, constellations, fragments of ancient alphabets.\n\nA teenage pregnancy and a broken family nest hurl her towards New York, and the part of her story fans will know. Mapplethorpe, Shepard and the Chelsea Hotel; Dylan and Burroughs and Lenny Kaye, terrain that crisscrosses her earlier books from fresh angles. \u201cClaiming the right to create without apology from a stance beyond gender or social definition\u201d is one of her cascading manifestos.",
