Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analysed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.\n\nThis satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows the control tower of the Naypyitaw International Airport in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. (AP)\n\nMyanmar's civil war also an obstacle\n\nAnother major complication is the civil war roiling much of the country, including the quake-affected areas. In 2001, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance.\n\nGovernment forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach.\n\nMore than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe interplay of politics and disaster was demonstrated Saturday night, when Myanmar\u2019s shadow National Unity Government announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts.\n\nIt said its armed wing, the People\u2019s Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas and it would also collaborate with the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations \"to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,\u201d in the areas it controls.\n\nVolunteers work at the site of a building that collapsed after an earthquake in Mandalay, central Myanmar. (AP)\n\nExtensive damage in cities\n\nThe earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks, including one measuring 6.4. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads and caused bridges to collapse.\n\nIn Naypyitaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday.\n\nAn initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it's allocating $5 million from a Central Emergency Response Fund for \u201clife-saving assistance.\u201d\n\nThe immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said.\n\nIt noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned of a \"severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Man arrested after fatal stabbing in Victoria\n\nBuddhist monks walk past a collapsed building after a powerful earthquake in Naypyitaw.

Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, said that Myanmar was ready to accept outside assistance.\n\nChina said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators, and pledged around $13.8 million in emergency aid. Russia\u2019s Emergencies Ministry said that it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies, and the country\u2019s Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team to Myanmar.\n\nOther countries like India, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore are also sending help, and US President Donald Trump said on Friday that Washington was going to help with the response.\n\nThe ceasefire plan announced by the opposition National Unity Government also proposed to provide health care professionals loyal to its resistance movement to work with international humanitarian organizations to deliver emergency rescue and medical services in areas under the military\u2019s control, if provided with safety guarantees.\n\nThe military has heavily restricted much-needed aid efforts to the large population already displaced by war even before the earthquake.\n\nSympathisers of the resistance have urged that relief efforts incorporate aid freely transported to areas under the control of the resistance, so it can't be weaponised by the army.\n\nThere was no immediate comment by the military to the announcement.\n\nRescuers work at the site of a high-rise building under construction that collapsed in Bangkok, Thailand. (AP Photo/Wason Wanichakorn)\n\nMilitary forces continued their attacks even after the quake, with three airstrikes in northern Kayin state, also called Karenni state, and southern Shan \u2013 both of which border Mandalay state, said Dave Eubank, a former US Army Special Forces soldier who founded the Free Burma Rangers, a private aid organization.\n\nEubank told the AP that in the area he was operating in, most villages have already been destroyed by the military so the earthquake had little impact.\n\n\u201cPeople are in the jungle and I was out in the jungle when the earthquake hit \u2013 it was powerful, but the trees just moved, that was it for us, so we haven\u2019t had a direct impact other than that the Burma army keeps attacking, even after the quake,\u201d he said.\n\nEarthquakes are rare in Bangkok, but relatively common in Myanmar.\n\nThe country sits on the Sagaing Fault, a major north-south fault that separates the India plate and the Sunda plate.\n\nBrian Baptie, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey, said that the quake caused intense ground shaking in an area where most of the population lives in buildings constructed of timber and unreinforced brick masonry.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a large earthquake in an area where there are over a million people, many of them living in vulnerable buildings, the consequences can often be disastrous,\u201d he said in a statement.",

Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nThe study \ufeffwas based on based on a survey of 375 Australians aged between 13 and 17.\n\nIt found that teen participants who initiated care with psychiatrists waited an average of 127.5 days, the longest wait time of any provider.\n\nThose seeking support from psychologists waited an average of 100.1 days, while the average wait time for paediatricians was 121.9 days, and the wait for national youth mental health foundation Headspace was 107.6 days.\n\nLong wait times can be attributed, in part, to a shortage of key providers like psychiatrists and higher demand for mental health support among young people. \ufeff\n\n\"We hear stories from young people who've waited months for a first appointment, been turned away, or given referrals to services they can't afford or even get to,\" Bannister said.\n\n\"Some say they've just stopped trying [...] because the system feels impossible to navigate, especially when you're already struggling.\"\n\nMost teen participants did not receive support from healthcare providers during that wait time and reported that their mental health worsened while waiting.\n\nLonger wait times were associated with \ufeffincreased psychological distress, with more than two-thirds of participants reporting that feelings of sadness worsened while waiting.\n\nMany also \ufeffreported engaging in unhealthy coping behaviours while waiting for care.\n\nMore than 92 per cent of participants reported engaging in maladaptive coping behaviours like spending more time alone, sleeping, or scrolling social media.\n\nA further 75 per cent reported engaging in risky behaviours such as \ufeffself-harming, skipping school, drinking alcohol, vaping and smoking.\n\nLong wait times can also lead to teens not attending treatment when the time finally comes.\n\nMore than half of the 14.7 per cent of participants \ufeffwho reported that they were likely to attend their first treatment session said it was because \"the wait time was too long\".\n\nThere were some positives, like the fact that almost nine in 10 participants employed help-seeking\ufeff behaviours while waiting for care, such as looking up mental health information online.\n\nBut overall \ufeffthe research highlighted the urgent need for systemic reform in the delivery of youth mental health services according to Professor Bridianne O'Dea, one of the lead researchers.\n\n\"We are now in the midst of a crisis where the demand for youth mental health care has increased rapidly in the past two decades,\" she said, via Scimex .\n\n\"The first line of treatment is psychological therapy. There is a huge demand for it and we do not have the number of clinicians required to meet that demand.\"\n\nYoung people who took part in the study called for better communication and \ufeffregular check-ins from service providers to help address the burden of waiting for care.\n\nO'Dea called for the introduction of evidence-based, government-backed national wait time benchmarks to help reduce how long Australian teens wait for critical support.\n\n\"Everyone needs someone safe to talk to,\" Bannister said.

    "text": "They're calling it the \"lost decade.\"\n\nResearchers at the Per Capita think-tank say Australians are still living with the consequences of severe wage stagnation from 2012 to 2022.\n\nThey say the average yearly wage today is almost $12,000 lower than it would have been if wage growth had kept up with its historical average in that period.\n\nThey say the wage suppression was so severe that it's contributing to our current housing crisis.\n\nWhat are 'forever renters'? Photo shows People waiting in line to view a rental property If entering the market is no longer an option for some Australians, is it still possible to achieve financial security while renting long term?\n\nCrucially, it hit Millennial and Gen Z workers in the critical early years of their working lives, robbing them of their first home deposit and reducing their borrowing power at the bank.\n\n\"Data from Australia's major banks shows that the typical first home buyer is a couple in their mid-30s borrowing just under $500,000,\" says Emma Dawson, Per Capita's executive director.\n\n\"If they had enjoyed the same wage growth as their parents did early in their careers, they would have earned an additional $54,000 each over the Lost Decade.\n\n\"Combined, that would have been enough for a 20 per cent deposit on their first home today,\" she said.\n\nThe analysis comes from a new report, The Lost Decade: How low wage growth stopped young Australians buying a home, which Per Capita will release on Monday.\n\nModern Australia: wage suppression and soaring house prices\n\nPer Capita says the consequences of what happened to wages between 2012 and 2022 aren't fully appreciated.\n\nIt says the suppression of wages in that decade combined with years of low interest rates and cheap debt, a lack of investment in non-market housing, low construction rates in the private market, tax incentives that encouraged property speculation, and rapid population growth, to cruel the chances of Millennials (and the Gen Z workers following them into the labour force) of being able to save independently to buy a home.\n\nThe numbers are stark.\n\nThe lip-service and hypocrisy behind our housing crisis Photo shows Rows of newly built houses in a suburb. If predictions come true it will be another year of deteriorating housing affordability, prices will rise at twice the rate of disposable income.\n\nAccording to its analysis, the 'real' value of workers' wages (the purchasing power of wages when inflation is taken into account) increased by just 2.6 per cent over the entire decade.\n\nBy contrast, in the two decades before that, from 1991 to 2011, real wages grew by 16 per cent in both decades.\n\nPer Capita's researchers say that collapse in purchasing power after 2012 had a profound impact on Australia.\n\nThey say young working people who were setting out on the journey towards home ownership and financial security in that period received none of the expected increases in real disposable income their parents enjoyed in the two decades from 1991 to 2011.\n\n\"They worked hard for a decade just to stand still while \u2026 the productivity gains that came from their hard work went to the profits of their employers rather than into their wages,\" the report says.\n\nAnd to compound the disaster, property prices exploded in that period.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2024, the average wage in current dollar terms increased by 37.5 per cent, but average house prices jumped by 95.1 per cent.\n\nIn the two decades between 2003 and 2024, wages in current dollar terms doubled, but house prices increased by nearly three times.\n\nPer Capita's paper says it's important to note that property prices are more variable than wages, without any consistent relationship in movement between the two.\n\n\"The data do not suggest that bigger wage increases drive higher home prices or vice versa,\" it says.\n\n\"Therefore, it is highly likely that higher wage growth during the Lost Decade would have improved housing affordability by a considerable margin.\"\n\nAustralia's social compact has broken\n\nThe paper say it's always been difficult for working and middle-class people to buy their first home, but modern young Australians have had their futures crippled.\n\n\"The typical pathway to home ownership for almost half a century after the second world war was to save a 10 to 20 per cent deposit on a modest first home and then borrow as much as your household income would allow to take on a 25-year mortgage,\" it says.\n\nReal estate agents 'culpable' in state's housing crisis Photo shows An aerial view of houses in Melbourne. The Real Estate Institute of Victoria (REIV) proposes property tax reforms to the government.\n\n\"While wages kept pace with home prices it was possible to save a deposit on a first home within three to five years, and this required prospective buyers to save diligently towards that goal.\n\n\"The journey to home ownership and financial security across the life course clearly relied on a certain social compact: that wage growth would consistently outstrip inflation and keep pace with increases in home prices during a person's working life.\n\n\"This was both the expectation and experience of generations of Australians after the second world war, until the impact and aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), which broke that social compact and led to a Lost Decade in which wage growth stalled completely,\" it says.\n\nPer Capita says the collapse in wage growth over the decade made finding an affordable first home \"unreasonably difficult for working people without accumulated or inherited wealth.\"\n\n\"It has trapped even those who were lucky enough to get into the market during this Lost Decade in their first home, unable to upgrade to a family home in which they can comfortably and securely raise children,\" it says.\n\nJust 36 per cent of late Millennials (people born between 1992 and 1996) had become homeowners at the time of the 2021 Census. (Per Capita, 'The Lost Decade: How low wage growth stopped young Australians buying a home,' March 2025, page 8.)\n\nWhere did the lost wages go?\n\nPer Capita's researchers say the wages that workers missed out on did not vanish into thin air.\n\nThey estimate the income lost amounted to more than $60 billion per year (more than $600 billion across the decade).\n\nAnd they say the phenomenon is reflected in the shift of national income from wages to profits over that period.\n\nHow Australia's housing market spun out of control Photo shows Woman with blonde hair and a white jacked in front of a black and white photograph of a wooden pier Property investment is ingrained in the Australian psyche, but is it too easy to cast landlords as the villain in our housing crisis?\n\nBetween 2012 and 2022, the wages share of national income fell approximately 3.6 percentage points while the profit share rose about 6.9 percentage points.\n\nThey say that trend has only reversed recently, with the wages share of national income rising by 3.8 percentage points between September 2022 and December 2024, and the profit share of income falling by 4.6 percentage points.\n\n\"The reasons for the flatlining of wages and rapidly escalating house prices between 2012 and 2022 are complex,\" the paper says.\n\n\"The impact of the GFC smashed business investment and created a drop in productivity gains that continues today, while the response of central banks created a sustained period of very low interest rates.\n\n\"This contributed to a rapid increase in property values, as people took advantage of access to what was very cheap, or even \"free\", debt to purchase larger homes or buy additional properties as investments.\n\n\"However, we find that a significant factor in the low wage growth of the Lost Decade was the introduction of WorkChoices legislation and its influence through the Fair Work Act.\n\n\"The Australian industrial relations system was a repressive outlier compared to other OECD countries in the early years of the 21st Century, when Millennials began their full-time working lives,\" the paper says.\n\nIt says recent changes to IR laws have removed \"many of the injustices\" in the Fair Work Act that stemmed from WorkChoices, but the damage done from wage stagnation and soaring house prices between 2012 and 2022 will take years to address.\n\nProductivity growth has barely improved for a decade\n\nHow serious is the productivity problem mentioned in Per Capita's paper?\n\nThe Productivity Commission released new data last week that confirmed a long-term negative trend for Australia.\n\nAustralia's labour productivity has not significantly improved in over 10 years. (Productivity Commission, quarterly productivity bulletin, March 2025)\n\n\"The pandemic and the policy response to it drove a sharp rise \u2014 and then a crash \u2014 in measured productivity,\" PC deputy chair Alex Robson said about the data.\n\n\"Now that the dust has settled, we're back to the stagnant productivity we saw in the period between 2015 and 2019 leading up to the pandemic.\n\n\"Australia's labour productivity has not significantly improved in over 10 years.\n\n\"With global policy uncertainty again on the rise, addressing productivity directly via targeted reforms will be the best way to sustainably boost Australians' living standards.\"",

Peter Dutton opposed the measures we put in place, making the code of conduct mandatory,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nLast week, Mr Dutton vowed to introduce a scheme to force as much as 20 per cent of gas that would otherwise be sold overseas to be diverted to the Australian market.\n\nThe Coalition leader said that influx of gas would bring power prices down by the end of the year.\n\nMr Dutton yesterday refused to put a figure on how much he expected consumers would save thanks to more gas in the market, but suggested it could lower the wholesale price from $14 per gigajoule to less than $10 per gigajoule.\n\nCoalition senator James Paterson said the party had worked on its policy for more than a year, and would release its modelling soon.\n\n\"We won't make the same mistake that Anthony Albanese did before the election when he lied to the Australian people 97 times and told them their electricity bills would go down $275,\" Senator Paterson said.\n\n\"Long before the first Australian casts their vote these policies will be in the public domain for people to scrutinise.\"\n\nShadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien told Sky News earlier that the domestic market should be \"decoupled\" from the international market, because Australia was \"awash\" with gas.\n\nGas policy has devil in the detail Photo shows Liquified natural gas plant and LNG ship on Curtis Island, Queensland Experts say the time to establish a gas reservation policy has passed, and plans to bring more gas online are years away and will fail to provide immediate relief to power prices.\n\nThe gas sector has decried the policy as a \"misfire\" that would be a \"damaging market intervention\" and exacerbate supply challenges in the long term.\n\nA gas reservation policy has existed in Western Australia for decades and has been previously endorsed by Labor \u2014 but the party has so far held back from supporting the policy in this election.\n\nMr Albanese told Insiders a system was already in place to direct gas giants as a last resort.\n\n\"We've actually put in place \u2026 a system where we can direct gas companies to secure domestic supply. We put that in place. Peter Dutton voted against it,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"Effectively it is [a gas reservation policy].

    "text": "Melbourne Victory coach Arthur Diles says the club's Pride Cup game \"represents what football is about\" and he didn't notice the absence of fans who chose not to attend their pulsating 5-3 win over Adelaide.\n\nVictory and Adelaide played an A-League Women/A-League Men double header for the Pride Cup on Saturday in an initiative which works to make sport more welcoming for the LGBTIQ+ community.\n\nBut the leadership of Victory's North Terrace active supporter group was absent for two high-stakes games against one of the club's biggest rivals.\n\nThat group instead attended the club's NPLM Victoria team's game against Green Gully in Shepparton, with its banners on display on the fences, in a move that was widely criticised by other Victory supporters.\n\nThere was still a large group of active fans for the 5-3 ALM triumph and Diles stressed the importance of the pride game.\n\n\"I didn't really notice it because we still had big numbers behind both ends of the goals,\" Diles said.\n\n\"In the end, it's a pride round this week and it's a game that represents what football is about \u2014 and it's for everybody.\n\n\"In the end, it was a football match. It had that associated with it, which is great. We've got to accept everybody from all walks of life.\n\n\"In the end, we had a great crowd there tonight. We had our actives behind both ends, who were fantastic again.\n\n\"Adelaide came with some good numbers as well, which proved that it's a derby.\n\n\"Fair play to their fans that turned up as well, it made it a really good atmosphere as well. So, in the end, it's a great night.\"\n\nThe Victory men's team is welcomed onto the field ahead of its Pride Cup match against Adelaide United. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nVictory's build-up to the game itself was relatively low key, with the club centring their Pride Cup plans during the week on education sessions for players and staff.\n\nWhile Victory's A-League Women players wore rainbow names and numbers on their jerseys in their 2-1 win, their ALM players had standard white names and numbers.\n\nIt's understood Victory were initially planning to just have captain's armbands for both their ALM and ALW teams, but the women's team had specifically requested to have rainbow names and numbers.\n\nThe men's players had not requested not to wear rainbow names and numbers.\n\nBoth of Adelaide's teams wore rainbow names and numbers.\n\nAdelaide have been leaders in the LGBTIQ+ space, especially after ALM-listed player Josh Cavallo came out as gay in 2021 \u2014 and was subjected to homophobic abuse from some Victory fans in 2022.\n\nAdelaide had a large travelling contingent on hand, while ALM coach Carl Veart and ALW counterpart Adrian Stenta both wore rainbow ribbon pins.\n\n\"It's about being inclusive and everyone has to feel safe,\" Veart said.\n\n\"And we've provided that environment with our culture in and around the club. Our supporters always feel part of the club.\n\n\"It's taken us a while to get to this point and it's a credit to everyone that works at the club and all of our supporters that we're very inclusive and we're quite open with our communication.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "When Soweto Gospel Choir singer Phello Jiyane heard she would be performing a show about house music, she was a little surprised.\n\n\"You wouldn't expect to have that combination of a DJ and gospel singers in the club scene,\" she tells ABC's Compass.\n\nHailing from the township of Soweto in South Africa, many of the choir members are deeply spiritual. Growing up, gospel was a means to connect with God.\n\nSince forming in 2002, the choir's unique sound \u2014 and powerful messages of hope and resistance \u2014 have attracted fans around the world, including Australian musician Simon Lewicki, better known as DJ Groove Terminator.\n\n\"The choir's religious, and I get that 'cause the dance floor [is] my church,\" explains Lewicki.\n\n\" Dance music's my religion, and it's the music that brings us together. \"\n\nBack in 2019, after watching the Soweto Gospel Choir perform at the Sydney Opera House, Lewicki approached the group with an interesting proposition: to collaborate on a project about house music.\n\nThe choir's Mary Mulovhedzi remembers her initial response was one of confusion.\n\n\"Our audience and his audience \u2014 two different people,\" she says.\n\nWhile the choristers looked at Lewicki \"a little strangely\", he persevered with the idea.\n\n\"I see the themes of \u2026 unity and freedom and joy \u2014 it could be a really powerful thing,\" he told them.\n\nThey were convinced, and the show that would become History of House was born.\n\n\"We loved the challenge,\" says Mulovhedzi. \"That's why we decided, why not?\"\n\nMembers of the choir and DJ Groove Terminator went sight seeing at some of Australia's most popular tourist spots during their tour. (Compass: Aaron Smith)\n\nThe Australian backstory\n\nThe connection between the Soweto Gospel Choir and Australia runs deep.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, Melbourne-based theatrical producer and concert promoter Andrew Kay had long wanted to bring an African choir to local shores.\n\nUnable to find a suitable fit, Kay and colleagues approached a local Soweto churchman to help them put a choir together.\n\n\"I was the stupid one who said, 'Let's do this!'\" says Kay, who continues to produce and manage the choir today.\n\nHe brought them to Australia, and the Soweto Gospel Choir performed their first-ever international tour.\n\nThe Soweto Gospel Choir have performed for dignitaries across the world, including Barack Obama. (Associated Press)\n\nSoon after, they were working with some of the world's biggest musicians, including Stevie Wonder, Celine Dion and U2, and performing for world leaders, such as Barack Obama.\n\nDespite their global success, it's Australia they call their second home.\n\nThe choristers have become regular visitors, performing with the Central Australian Aboriginal Women's Choir, appearing on TV and radio, and making many friends along the way, including DJ Groove Terminator.\n\nAfter proposing the collaboration to the choir, Simon Lewicki flew to South Africa in 2020 to spend time with the group and workshop their new show.\n\nHistory of House takes audiences on a musical journey from the disco era of the 70s through to the birth of house music, and its incarnations in the 80s and 90s.\n\nIt spans from Aretha Franklin's A Deeper Love, to Donna Summer's disco classic I Feel Love, to house hits like Good Life by Inner City.\n\nLoading...\n\nAs the choir and Simon developed the project, a bond formed between them that extended beyond the music.\n\n\"[Lewicki took time] to be with us and listen to our stories \u2026 Look at where we live, how we live,\" says choirmaster Shimmy Jiyane.\n\n\"That touched us.\"\n\nApartheid and the Soweto Uprising\n\nGrowing up in South Africa, the members of the choir were all affected by apartheid, many witnessing violence and brutality as children.\n\n\"It was tough,\" says Thabiso Molefe. \"If you were a man, or if you were a boy, [the police] would beat you up. So, we used to wear ladies' clothes.\"\n\n\"I was asking my mother, 'Mamma, why am I wearing a dress?' They would say, 'The police are coming, they will grab you up'.\"\n\nApartheid was a policy of racial segregation and oppression, enforced by the South African government between 1948 to 1994, which separated housing and employment opportunities by race, privileging white citizens over everyone else.\n\nPublic transport, parks, beaches, theatres, restaurants, and other amenities were segregated for \"coloured\" and \"whites\", and inter-racial marriages were prohibited.\n\nEntrenched racial inequality also extended to education.\n\nThe Soweto Uprising was a defining moment in the struggle to end apartheid in South Africa (ABC)\n\nIn June 1976, the choir members' home \u2014 Soweto \u2014 was the site of one of South Africa's worst race riots.\n\nBlack students started a peaceful protest to oppose a government policy that forced them learn in Afrikaans, a West Germanic language largely associated with their oppressor.\n\nMost black students already had to learn English as a second language, and many black teachers complained they didn't know Afrikaans well enough to teach in it.\n\nThe police brutality that followed the protest shocked the world.\n\nChoir member Phello Jiyane recalls hearing stories from her mother, a student at the time, about how young people in the town mobilised together.\n\n\"They were walking down the streets in Soweto, and singing and chanting,\" she says.\n\n\" I think the police got scared and they started opening fire.\"\"The students, they did not even have weapons. \"\n\nPhello's husband, Shimmy Jiyane, calls it the day when \"everything changed\".\n\n\"That was a sad day for South Africa,\" he says.\n\nWhile exact numbers are hard to determine, records suggest hundreds died and thousands were injured due to those and other protests.\n\nMany credit the Soweto uprising and its aftermath to helping end apartheid in South Africa.\n\nFinding hope in music\n\nMusic played a major role during the Soweto uprising.\n\n\"There's a song that is called Umandela Uthi Ayihlome Ihlasele,\" says Mulovhedzi.\n\n\"That song says, 'Let us go fight back'.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nToday, Mulovhedzi and the choir continue to sing those protest songs as part of their solo show, called Hope.\n\nIt's a deeply spiritual performance, featuring songs from church, the apartheid struggle, as well as the African American civil rights movement.\n\n\"On stage, we're smiling, we're praying, but inside there's so much that we are going through,\" says Mulovhedzi.\n\n\"I think I pray from song number one, until the last song.\"\n\nFor Shimmy Jiyane the songs from Hope inspired him to believe that change was possible during the dark days of apartheid.\n\n\"The songs that we're singing \u2026 they gave us so much power,\" he says.\n\n\"Cause right now, I'm in Australia \u2026 And it is because of what happened, it is because of the people who fought for us.\"\n\nLoading...\n\n'All are welcome here'\n\nGrowing up in South Australia, musician Simon Lewicki had an entirely different connection to music.\n\nThe DJ-in-the-making found himself drawn to house music, a genre that sprang from underground clubs in Chicago and New York in the late 70s and early 80s.\n\nLike gospel, house music also has political roots.\n\nAs the disco era declined, DJs began playing house music predominantly to queer, black and Latino communities in warehouses and safe spaces.\n\nIndeed, songs by artists like Chuck Roberts and Jungle Brothers take audiences on a sonic and sensory journey in History of House.\n\nFor many around the world, including Lewicki, the house genre came to be associated with values like inclusivity and diversity.\n\n\"I'm from Adelaide, I'm not from Chicago. I didn't grow up at in ground zero,\" says Lewicki.\n\n\" House music \u2026 gave me a direction. House music is very inclusive. Every song says 'All are welcome here. You're free to be who you want to be.' \"\n\nLewicki realised his passion for music, by becoming a DJ.\n\nUnder the stage name of Groove Terminator, he became a favourite at clubs and went on to receive ARIA nominations and make several hit singles.\n\nThese days, Lewicki lives in Byron Bay with his family.\n\nLoading...\n\nLike him, they've formed a friendship with the members of the Soweto Gospel Choir.\n\nLewicki's daughters, in particular, are big fans.\n\n\"They tend to think they're in the choir sometimes,\" says Lewicki.\n\nThe admiration runs both ways.\n\n\"Simon \u2026 he's part of our family,\" says Soweto Gospel Choir singer Phello Jiyane.\n\n\"He comes and prays with us. He might not be religious but the fact that he's there and he's respecting what we are doing, we just love him for that.\"\n\nWatch The DJ and the Gospel Choir on Compass tonight at 6:30pm on ABC TV or stream now on iview.",

(Supplied: Dariah Porter )\n\nBut despite increasing community awareness on guide dogs and their legal right to access public places, the role of assistance animals in Tasmania is still largely misunderstood, especially when it comes to rentals and entering supermarkets, Ms Porter says.\n\nAssistance animals recognised under disability laws\n\nAssistance animals offer highly trained disability support services to people who rely on them to participate in personal and public life with greater independence and confidence.\n\nIn Australia, they are considered working animals \u2014 along with seeing and hearing dogs \u2014 and are covered under the 1992 Disability Discrimination Act, meaning they have full access to public facilities.\n\nThat's not to be confused with emotional support animals, or companion animals, which are not recognised as service animals under disability laws and are considered pets.\n\nFor Ms Porter, the difference is often not well understood by the public.\n\n\"I found when I was including the fact I had an assistance dog on [rental] applications, I was being rejected,\" she said.\n\nAssistance dog Maverick can legally access any space his handler can. (Supplied: Dariah Porter )\n\nKnowing that federal law protected her, she had previously left Maverick off applications and notified the home-owner once approved, to help her chances of approval.\n\nLandlords, agents call for more protection for pets in rentals Photo shows cat sitting on bed looking at camera Under new laws, Tasmanian landlords will have little say on whether a pet can be brought to live on their property. While some have praised the change, the state's real estate body says more protections should be put in place to safeguard investors.\n\nBut she still faces difficulties, even when explaining her situation.\n\nPart of the problem, she says, is ambiguity between federal and Tasmanian state definitions of what an assistance animal is.\n\nShe said it would be easier for everyone if state law, which only mentions guide dogs and no other type of assistance animal, was clarified.\n\nMs Porter said the laws, which were last amended in 1988, were \"incredibly outdated and incredibly discriminative in nature\".\n\nWhile people experiencing discrimination can fight for their rights in the legal system, it's not always the best course.\n\nMaverick has been trained to provide cardiac assistance to Ms Porter. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nTasmania's Anti-Discrimination Commission says by relying on federal law, it is usually able to resolve discrimination complaints about assistance animals in favour of the complainant.\n\nBut for Ms Porter, the possibility of having to consider legal action for everyday activities and needs weighed on her.\n\n\"At any point, any business can just turn around and say 'no', and the only way to have that dealt with is to report it to the Human Rights Commission,\" she said.\n\n\"But that takes up to six months to even have it looked at, let alone have it dealt with.\"\n\n'Outdated laws' causing 'distress'\n\nThe federal Disability Discrimination Act recognises assistance animals that are trained or accredited, and federal law generally prevailed over state laws \u2014 although they are designed to work concurrently.\n\nTasmania has a Guide Dogs and Hearing Dogs Act, which doesn't mention other types of assistance dogs or animals.\n\nThe state's anti-discrimination law does not reference assistance animals at all.\n\nTasmania's Acting Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Pia Saturno said her office was increasingly receiving discrimination reports of this nature.\n\nPia Saturno says complaints were typically resolved in favour of the individual using an assistance animal in line with federal law.

Elise Smith shares her experience.\n\nShe said federal law, even though prevailing over state law, was not designed to limit state laws, so where there are discrepancies, a court or tribunal determines the outcome.\n\nMs Saturno said usually complaints were resolved in favour of the individual using an assistance animal in line with federal law.\n\nBut she said reform was needed, with exclusion incidents causing \"increased distress\" and long-lasting impacts, \"particularly where it happens in front of others\".\n\n\"It's all very unclear and confusing for people who rely on assistance animals, but also people who have businesses and provide services,\" Ms Saturno said.\n\n\"In 2025, more people rely on assistance animals, including children, in education, for their everyday life,\" she said.\n\nShe said the \"systemic issue which requires more than individual complainants pursuing their rights through an outdated legislative and regulatory framework\".\n\n\"We all have a right to live our lives without being discriminated against.\"\n\nOpportunity for change is now\n\nPrincipal solicitor at the tenants' union Ben Bartl, said the state government had an opportunity to make the law clearer during its current amendments to Tasmania's Residential Tenancy Act \u2014 which will allow current and future renters to have pets in their homes.\n\nBen Bartl says upcoming amendments to the tenancy act will allow current and future renters to have pets in their homes. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nCurrently, the draft legislation mirrors the state's Guide Dogs and Hearing Dogs Act by not noting other types of assistance animals.\n\nHe said with the present misalignment between state and federal law, many people felt they couldn't engage in public life like others.\n\n\" [Being told] that they can't work where they want, they're not allowed to go to the cinema, or enter shops. \"\n\nIn a report to be released on Monday, the union makes a number of recommendations to the state government it hopes will lead to greater inclusion for those living with disability.\n\nIt's calling for the state's Residential Tenancy Act to \"expressly recognise that an assistance animal is not a pet\" and for the government to invest in a \"community education campaign to increase awareness of the rights of people with disability to be accompanied by an assistance animal\".\n\nThe report, Recognising Assistance Animals in Tasmanian Law, states that almost a third of Tasmanians live with disability, of which about 11 per cent living with a \"severe or profound disability\", with the number likely to increase as the population grows and ages.\n\nChanges in residential tenancy laws will allow renters to keep pets. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nMs Porter said more awareness and education was needed around the rights of those relying on assistance animals, and this should be driven by updated legislation.\n\n\"Unless the state law is in line with the federal law, there's limited-to-no-options when it is happening, unless you can stand up for yourself,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked about the increase in discrimination reports, in part due to outdated Tasmanian legislation, the state government did not directly respond.\n\nIt did say it \"participates in the [Commonwealth] Assistance Animals Working Group, which has developed draft National Principles for Assistance Animals\", which the Tasmanian government would consider once the proposed principles passed the consultation phase.\n\n\"We want to ensure Tasmania's legislative framework regarding assistance animals strikes an appropriate balance between protecting community members from discrimination and allowing them to enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms,\" a government spokesperson said.\n\nThe state government also said it was in the final stages of recruiting a Tasmanian Disability Commissioner.",

    "text": "As he sang the 21st song, Das Wirtshaus (The Inn), of Schubert\u2019s great cycle of mournfulness, Winterreise, Matthias Goerne moved arms, hands and torso with the free expressive grace he had shown throughout the performance, almost as though tracing and amplifying through the air the superb melodic shapes created by his voice. At the piano his co-artist Daniil Trifonov sat implacably immobile, the hymn-like arch of the melody welling and attenuating under his fingers as though controlled solely by concentrated thought. Over and above the artistic calibre of each, the uniqueness of this event was witnessing two supreme artists, each with their own powerful vision and distinct artistic personality, create a masterpiece before one\u2019s eyes. Daniil Trofonov and Matthias Goerne. Credit: Craig Abercrombie With the first song Gute Nacht, Goerne began the cycle with light pleasantly arched line, Trifonov establishing the dull foot-fall rhythm that initiates the cycle\u2019s literal and metaphoric journey, while highlighting accented details with almost morbid insistence. In the second song, Goerne released flashes of anger and wildness, while he threaded fragile lines against Trifonov\u2019s spiky piano part to sinister effect. The turbulent activity of the piano\u2019s right hand in Erstarrung (Numbness), set up a tussle for dominance with the voice\u2019s lower notes. A similar striving was to become evident in the 18th song, Der st\u00fcrmische Morgen (The Stormy Morning), though this was not misjudged balance, but rather deliberately bringing out a struggle inherent in the music.\n\nA different sort of struggle was captured in the cycle\u2019s best-known song Der Lindebaum, in which the quietly nervous agitation of Trifonov\u2019s introduction was answered by superb melodic curves of idyllic beauty from Goerne. In Die Post (The Mail Coach) at the cycle\u2019s half-way point, Goerne made the lines float with a sense of evanescent hope, which Trifonov grounded in stubborn reality with spiky precision. Goerne\u2019s ability to change vowel shape, and inflate lines with dreamy weightlessness while combining with the unyielding rhythmic tread of Trifonov\u2019s chiselled disciplined sound with absolute precision, captured to perfection the combination of hope and despair that underlines Schubert\u2019s conception, nowhere better than in the penultimate song Die Nebensonnen (Phantom Suns). For the closing song Der Leiermann (The Hurdy-Gurdy Man), Schubert empties the music of feeling with a repetitive figure on the piano over a static bass to which, in contrast to his previous rhythmic discipline, Trifonov gave deliberate rhythmic waywardness as though fingers were numb with cold and the controlling mind had departed. After singing without break for about an hour and a quarter, Goerne was still able to inject the muffled closing lines with the subdued richness of fading warmth. Unforgettable. DANCE\n\nSomos\n\nNeilson Studio at Sydney Dance Company, March 27\n\nUntil April 13\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGrowing up in Spain, Sydney Dance Company artistic director Rafael Bonachela listened to flamenco tapes his father played in the car. His father was from Granada, renowned for flamenco music and dance. The teenage Bonachela \u2013 whose dream was to be Leroy from the film Fame \u2013 was more keen on \u201cMichael Jackson, Tina Turner\u2026anything but flamenco\u201d. Decades on and settled in Sydney, Somos (Spanish for \u201cwe are\u201d) is Bonachela\u2019s \u201clove letter\u201d to Spain and the haunting music of his adolescence. It features a remarkably beautiful playlist of Latin music, including flamenco songs, Mexican ranchera music (a favourite of Bonachela\u2019s mother) and covers by flamenco pop legend Rosalia (who in the Spanish-speaking world is often considered to be bigger than Taylor Swift). Somos is Rafael Bonachela\u2019s love letter to Spain. Somos originally premiered in 2023 in SDC\u2019s then newly renovated studios, on a small mirrored stage configured in-the-round. The choice of venue was a pragmatic decision \u2013 at the time, the usual Sydney theatres were booked by other companies. But the cosy venue gives Somos its trademark feeling of closeness, by turns intimate and suffocating. Somos makes the audience feel almost voyeuristic, peering at the dancers through a sheer red curtain (Kelsey Lee\u2019s set design) under soft amber lighting (by Damien Cooper). In the universe that is Somos, everyone seems impossibly beautiful and in a relationship, clad in barely-there mesh and peering through the curtain with smokey eyelined eyes (Lee\u2019s costumes). Here, dancers don\u2019t simply walk, they pace \u2013 with a smouldering, sultry air.\n\nIn its 2023 iteration, Somos was undeniably stylish but became almost superficially one-note in its focus on Spanish sexiness. In this updated version, Bonachela has changed two songs and some of the choreography, giving Somos a far more expansive emotional range and compelling musical variety. You can almost hear the piece opening up and sighing in relief at becoming a little bit more human, a little bit more complex and relatable. There are gorgeous duets and ensemble scenes, featuring incandescent, athletic, impeccably timed partnering. Highlights are the duets from real-life couple Naiara de Matos and Piran Scott, who leap headlong into a fearless series of soaring lifts and turns; and Ryan Pearson and Luke Hayward, whose heart-in-your-mouth finale to Estrella Morente\u2019s cover of Jacques Brel\u2019s Ne Me Quitte Pas sears with push-and-pull vulnerability and cruelty. THEATRE\n\nThe Glass Menagerie\n\nEnsemble Theatre, March 26\n\nUntil April 26\n\nReviewed by HARRIET CUNNINGHAM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Memory is a slippery beast. You reach out and try to grab it, and it either slips away or, at your touch, crystallises into an entirely new thing that is neither truth nor fantasy. You must handle it with the utmost care to protect its fragility or see it shatter into pieces.\n\nI\u2019m in pieces after seeing the Ensemble Theatre\u2019s new production of The Glass Menagerie. Starring Blazey Best as Amanda Wingfield, the family matriarch, and featuring promising debuts from Bridie McKim and Tom Rodgers, Tennessee Williams\u2019 breakout work shakes off the weight of its masterpiece status to become a gripping night in the theatre. Blazey Best stars as Amanda Wingfield, a fading Southern belle abandoned by her husband. Credit: Prudence Upton Amanda Wingfield is a fading Southern belle, long abandoned by her husband. Her two adult children, Tom and Laura, still live with her. Tom has a dead-end job and a yen for travel. Laura is shy and awkward. Meanwhile, a portrait of their father, an alcoholic travelling salesman somehow recast as a hero, lowers over them all. Dreams, memories and fantasies can barely sustain them. Into this bleak house comes a gentleman caller. Jim O\u2019Connor, Tom\u2019s work colleague, is bright and affable and feels like a potential lifeline, but can he handle the glass menagerie without breaking it? Director Liesel Badorrek embraces the poetry and symbolism of Williams\u2019 ravishing prose. Danny Ball, an eloquent and explosive Tom, doubles as Tom-the-narrator, and the decision to have him also voice part of the stage directions offers further layers of meaning. Laura\u2019s tray of glass ornaments glows with its own inward light as action takes place in the shadows (lighting by Verity Hampson).\n\nMeanwhile, a naturalistic setting (costumes and set by Grace Deacon) melts, literally, from the wall-papered backdrop onto the floor, like the cloudy edges of an old photo. Tom\u2019s opening soliloquy drips with Southern vowels, and Blazey Best\u2019s accent is a brittle, fascinating fabrication. Is it too much? The accents, which do mellow across the evening, play at the edge of parody, but perhaps we have to take Tennessee Williams at his word: as Tom-the-narrator says: \u201cBeing a memory play \u2026 it is not realistic\u201d. Best dazzles as Amanda Wingfield, simultaneously exasperated and desperate for her children\u2019s futures. Her range, from coquettish simper to tiger roar, is exhilarating and well-matched by Ball, who takes Tom from poetic malaise to volcanic rage in the blink of an eye. By contrast, Bridie McKim and Tom Rodgers, as Laura and Jim, hold the stage with silences that range from excruciating to magical. They negotiate their dialogue with delicacy and lightness to the point that you almost believe Jim has fallen in love with Laura. The Glass Menagerie is a classic that comes with some hefty baggage of history, not least the shock of 1930s America\u2019s casual racism and ableism. This production pays respectful but not slavish homage to the original to create a compelling piece of theatre for our times.\n\nMUSIC\n\nMJ Lenderman\n\nSydney Opera House, March 25\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 One of the more irritating descriptions of a certain type of, let\u2019s say relaxed rock \u2013 where drawling vocals and dragging rhythms meet solid-state and sometimes squalling guitars \u2013 is the term \u201cslacker\u201d. It\u2019s a phrase that works as a generational putdown (\u201ckids today ...\u201d etc.), and a cool-kids boast (\u201cwe\u2019re above all that\u201d, etc.) and regularly is applied to a lineage running from Neil Young to J Mascis (of Dinosaur Jr) and Kurt Vile to MJ Lenderman. MJ Lenderman and his band. Credit: Jordan Munns The inaccuracy of this term and its assumptions was made abundantly clear four songs into this wonderful night of country-inflected rock from North Carolina\u2019s Catholic saviour.\n\nA man of buoyant hair and sleepy eyes, with a band that look like \u201970s West Coast dudes washed through a \u201990s indie cycle We\u2019d had the low twang opening/hair-tossing climax of Wristwatch, and we would soon get almost funky and definitely bi-coastal with You Have Bought Yourself A Boat, but in Rudolph, there was a definite rhythm and momentum that drove rather than dozed. The fuzzed guitar diversions and snaking lines were ragged and sometimes gnarly; the pedal steel was curly and often tender. It moved air, chugging and chunky enough, but above it all, it was romantic. Not mere heartache but in the idea of the music and its potential to redirect and maybe even change you with energy or hope or succour. It is central to Lenderman: he loves this and believes in it, burrows into it in the new song, Pianos (melody descending, guitar ascending and hitting that War On Drugs sweet spot of blurry power and blissful harmonics) and soaks us all in it with the languorous You Don\u2019t Know The Shape I\u2019m In. It\u2019s why in She\u2019s Leaving You, pushed by solid thumping drums that made the guitar even starker, you couldn\u2019t miss that a Mac-like pop song was barely hiding inside its meatiness. And why a cover of Neil Young\u2019s Lotta Love in the encore was pulled together by a dreamer\u2019s deep affection.\n\nSlacker? Nah, he cares. A lot. La Musica Notturna\n\nOmega Ensemble\n\nCity Recital Hall, March 25\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Cellist and guest director Umberto Clerici joked that he had replaced the first piece on the program, Giovanni Sollima\u2019s Alone with another piece by Sollima, Hell 1, because he had played Alone so often that he was bored with it. Ennui with Alone had apparently subsided by the end, and he played it as an encore. Sollima is a Sicilian cellist and composer with eclectic imagination for local colour and the program showcased another work of his, Violoncelles, vibrez! for two cellos (Clerici and Paul Stender) and strings.\n\nThe program concluded with the Sydney premiere of Everything we hear comes from silence for solo cello, solo clarinet and strings. Hell 1 began with a chant-like melody on solo cello, to which the accompanying string group added modal harmonies, over which the soloist adds decorative embellishment with the chant returning unadorned at the end. Taking its inspiration from Dante\u2019s Inferno, it made the first circle of hell seem more melancholy than torturous and not even particularly unpleasant. Violoncelles, vibrez! began with repeated notes that went out of phase as more instruments joined, creating minimalist textures for the string ensemble. Against this, the solo cellists played languorously sliding sighs that also moved in and out of phase before giving way to more frenetic music. After the sigh-like gestures returned, the piece ended with a pulsating figure on strings drifting away to nothing. Alone, for solo cello, also featured a chant-like melody set in organ-like textures by the idiomatic use of multi-string chords, with the cello\u2019s D string providing a focus and modal centre.\n\nBetween the Sollima works, the Omega Ensemble dipped into the eighteenth century with the fancifully descriptive Quintet, Opus 30, No. 6, La Music Notturna delle Strade di Madrid by cellist/composer Luigi Boccherini and Vivaldi\u2019s Concerto for cello and strings in B minor, RV424. Boccherini\u2019s quintet evoked church bells, dancing, beggars, street singers and soldiers, creating a harmless though inconsequential diversion. Clerici played the solo part of Vivaldi\u2019s concerto with elegance and a strong projection of the music\u2019s gesture and overriding expressive shape. The program concluded with the Sydney premiere of Everything we hear comes from silence for solo cello, solo clarinet (David Rowden) and strings by another cellist-composer, Peter Gregson. The first movement began with a hushed high unison from cello and clarinet, which gradually diverged to create a still, expansive mood like the glistening presence of a dew-covered dawn. The second movement evoked a similar mood in a lower pitch register, while the third opened similarly, then gained in speed for a moment before returning to the glowing, cinematic mood of the opening. Though calming, more variety of mood and texture might sustain a three-movement work better.\n\nMUSIC\n\nRUTHIE FOSTER\n\nThe Lounge, Chatswood Concourse, March 21\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Ruthie Foster wasn\u2019t just born to sing; she was probably already singing in the womb. Music pours from her like water from a tap, and when she turns the tap on full, she makes an astounding sound: a huge, church-bred cry that pierces your very soul. OK, you say, many singers have big voices. The wretched TV talent-quest industry is built on belters. But here\u2019s the thing: when Ruthie hits the big notes \u2013 high, long, and of phenomenal power \u2013 she doesn\u2019t lose the intimacy of when she\u2019s singing softly. It\u2019s the same deal, it just happens to be pushing you so far back in your seat you\u2019re nearly in the lap of the person behind. There were many highlights in Ruthie Foster\u2019s gig. Credit: Lucinda Goodwin Few singers have been able to do that. Aretha Franklin and maybe Sinatra at his best, but it\u2019s a short list. The records of hers with which I\u2019m familiar didn\u2019t prepare me for the fact I was to hear someone live in the memory on the plane of greats like Jos\u00e9 Carreras and Betty Carter.\n\nFoster is from Austin, Texas, the state that\u2019s given us so many great musicians, from Ornette Coleman to Janis Joplin, Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson and Beyonc\u00e9. Like others on that list, she has catholic tastes that emerge both in the songs she writes and in those she covers, so the blues, gospel, soul and even country become one, united by an unfailing feel for a funky groove. The groove comes courtesy of her own guitar (a new, Australian-made model Lloyd Spiegel gave her at the start of this tour) and Scottie Miller\u2019s keyboard. The latter has been her collaborator for 17 years, and it shows. Mostly using piano or electric piano sounds, sometimes with a frosting of strings, Miller colours the songs and solos with panache and adds backing vocals. He\u2019d already proved he was a more than useful operator in an opening solo set, playing his own material. But sometimes, one wished he would just back off the chordal playing enough so we could more readily hear Foster\u2019s slippery, finger-picking grooves. Even better, of course, would be if she\u2019d come with her full band, but that\u2019s a hope for another time. As it was, the highlights were many. Having signed to Sun Records for the Mileage album that just won her a first Grammy (after six nominations), she showed a keen sense of tradition by taking Arthur \u201cBig Boy\u201d Crudup\u2019s That\u2019s Alright (which was a Sun hit for Elvis Presley), slowing it down, and letting it simmer on a funky dialogue between guitar and keyboard. Even better was Pete Seeger\u2019s If I Had a Hammer, again slowed but very insistent, with her voice ringing like some vast bell. Then, on her own Phenomenal Woman, she unleashed the full power of her miraculous singing to such an extent that all that had gone before seemed merely a trickle before the flood.\n\nMUSICALS\n\nGuys & Dolls: Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour\n\nFleet Steps, Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Point, March 21\n\nUntil April 20\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Staged on a giant outdoor floating stage backed by breathtaking harbour views, Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour (HOSH) is one of the ritziest events of the year. The red-carpeted annual spectacular alternates between big-scale operas and lucrative musicals. This year\u2019s was the latter: Guys & Dolls, the 1950 musical theatre classic about a gambler with a heart of gold. Brian Thomson\u2019s successful New York City set is all gritty concrete and smokestacks. The centrepiece is a big yellow taxi, and this year for the first time the orchestra is visible in an overhead gantry, removing previous HOSH latency issues. Jason Arrow as Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Joel Granger as Benny Southstreet and John Xintavelonis as Harry the Horse. Credit: Neil Bennett\n\nIf you like your musicals traditional, Guys & Dolls is for you. It\u2019s a cookie-cutter New York City where men in candy-coloured plaid suits (Jennifer Irwin\u2019s luminous costumes) dance in lines, unironically singing with pork pie hats in outstretched arms. Women have flouncy skirts, tight curls and high 1950s voices. The ensemble (Kelley Abbey\u2019s choreography) is outstanding: the dancing is sharp, unified, bursting with energy. The cast is warm, likeable and strongly voiced. Annie Aitken brings comedic sympathy as Salvation Army heroine Sarah Brown, Bobby Fox creates theatrical depth as craps game organiser Nathan Detroit, and Home and Away starlet Angelina Thomson is an audience favourite as showgirl Adelaide. Cody Simpson looks the part as hero Sky Masterson. Both Thomson and Simpson (a former elite athlete) bring strong physicality to their performances. Jason Arrow, fresh from leading Hamilton, scene-steals as Nicely-Nicely Johnson. His rendition of Sit Down, You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat saves a sluggish Act 2, overflowing with such charisma the audience loses itself cheering and clapping along.

Trauma for me is like a shadow. If I escape from it, it will follow me. The best way is to deal with the pain - that it happened, it's a part of me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kurdish refugee says he still struggles to unpack his trauma from that time - which was followed by over a year detained in two Melbourne hotels, after being transferred to Australia to treat severe asthma and mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like I'm holding maybe a knife and I'm carving the words on my skin, it's so difficult... that's why sometimes I feel not at the moment, I have to be patient. It will be okay, it's not the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2020 report in the British Journal of Psychology that looked at refugees resettling in high-income countries found one in three globally have experienced some form of mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a new study from the University of New South Wales has found those who have experienced offshore detention, or prolonged onshore detention, are more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder compared to other refugees.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Philippa Specker was the lead researcher on the British Journal of Psychology report, and says individuals are more likely to experience PTSD when they feel unsafe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who experience detention might be witnessing or experiencing further traumatic or adverse events that add to their mental health burden, and might make them even more at risk of having mental health problems, even years after joining the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Specker says not all detention experiences carry the same risk for mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who spend time in offshore detention are 20 times more likely to develop PTSD compared to those who spent less than six months in onshore detention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in prolonged onshore detention, or for longer than six months, were almost 17 times more likely to report PTSD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There seems to be something about being detained in a facility offshore that puts someone at especially high risk. I think when we consider what this experience might feel like for someone who's come to Australia seeking asylum, they arrive in Australia seeking asylum and are then relocated to a third country by the very government, they're asking to give them safety and support. So it's understandable that this might undermine people's sense of security and certainty about the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blue's chief executive Georgie Harman says this is a situation where mental health literacy comes into play.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales Mental Health Commission says this type of literacy is about people's knowledge of health care systems, and their ability and confidence in accessing and understanding them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Harman says for culturally and linguistically diverse people generally, mental health literacy is far lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People from CALD communities access mental health support often when they're in extreme distress or crisis. We also know that they don't seek support at the same rates as the rest of the general population. And again there are a whole range of reasons for that: language barriers, confusion about the system, which is really confusing for most of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis resonates for Reshma Manandhar, who migrated from Nepal to Australia 20 years ago and believes she struggled with post-natal depression after the birth of her first child, despite not having the language for what she was experiencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the big mental health issue for me was when I had my son, and I think I had post-natal depression but I wasn't aware of it. It was a very difficult time for me - having a kid here, being in a completely different environment, not the support that I'm used to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blue has formed a new partnership with settlement agency AMES that it hopes will improve mental health awareness in migrant and refugee communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partnership looks to reach people in community, offering mental health training to AMES staff, and providing easy English support resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMES CEO Cath Scarth says reaching people in a culturally safe environment is essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For us at AMES, we have, I suppose, four key determinants that we think are critical for successful settlement. The obvious ones, education, speaking, English, safe, secure housing, obviously employment. But the fourth critical pillar is really about health and wellbeing, and mental health is a critical part of that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReshma now works as a coordinator in community engagement for AMES.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes her experiences will help others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my community, most of us, we've come from Nepal and we are facing similar challenges. And when we talk about it, it makes it normal. It normalises it. And then when you say, oh, there is a help available, you can seek help, or, oh, I have gone to see someone, and that really helped. That opens up and that makes it normal. And that sort of says to other people that, yes, you can access help. It is all right to seek help. It is all right to say, you know what, I have a problem in the first place. Sometimes we don't even admit to ourselves that we have problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mostafa, he says professional support has failed him so far - and that psychologists must be skilled to navigate this unique trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I see they try to engage with what I am talking about, but they don't understand it because they were not in detention. It's very complicated. It's not easy when I share this. It's not something simple. Someone was in detention for a decade and comes out and go to another room. Okay, I'm going to share what happened to me with a psychologist. The psychologist should have the qualification of dealing with high level of trauma. Otherwise, the trauma becomes much bigger to the person.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a battle Mostafa is still navigating after he lost an appeal in a 2022 High court case, which found Australia's hotel detention is legal but 'lacked human decency'.\n\n\n\n\n\nA current case is arguing against an asylum seeker's removal to Nauru detention under the government's new powers to deport anyone without a visa to third countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment who have not yet responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, still living in limbo on a bridging visa, Moz has turned to art, produced with some unusual tools.\n\n\n\n",

And that reservoir is the ocean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral companies are testing a new theory that the carbon dioxide currently in the ocean can be reduced by changing it from a gas to a solid.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Burt is the chief ocean scientist at one of those companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis workplace, Planetary Technologies, has been using magnesium oxide to try to lock away carbon dioxide for centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You add an alkaline or a basic mineral to the ocean and that mineral is essentially an antacid. It neutralises acid the same way an antacid neutralises acid in your stomach. This alkaline mineral neutralises carbon dioxide acid in the ocean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome companies are using other items such as rocks or nutrients to try to produce the same effect, while others use seaweed and algae to absorb carbon similar to the way plants do it on land.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting from Planetary Technologies has found no risk to marine ecosystems from magnesium oxide so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some are still concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Lapp, who works at fishing company SeaFreeze, says there are environmental protection concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't dump poison on your farmland. You don't dump poison in the ocean. And, you know, back in the 1970s we created the Clean Water Act to ensure that we have clean water and we're not dumping chemicals into the ocean. And now to be doing that in the name of carbon capture to me is just irresponsible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve its full impact, carbon dioxide removal needs to occur on a much larger scale than it currently does.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Ho is also the co-founder of non-profit business C-Worthy, which focuses on using the seas to fight climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group is developing technology to assess the impact of marine carbon removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The experiments that are being done now and the scale at which they're being done, it's pretty safe. The question is what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year? And that's still to be determined.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains further challenges will arise with the growth in scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a challenge in the amount of energy that's needed, the amount of stuff we need to move around, the infrastructure that's needed. And there's also the challenge of who's going to pay for it because it's going to cost trillions of dollars every year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDebates continue in the industry over how to balance the potential benefits to the environment and the risks of adding new materials to the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs tests are conducted from the waters of North America through to New Zealand, developments in the understanding of marine carbon removal are likely to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are problems still to be solved, Planetary's Chief Scientist Will Burt says there is no time to delay.\n\n\n\n",

But seems like my mother tripped and fell, my sister tried to help her up and that's when they couldn't make it out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters still don't know how much less they will be paying for power under the opposition's gas plan - and Opposition leader Peter Dutton can expect to be pressed for more detail on day two of the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth major parties were selling their cost-of-living blueprints to voters on Saturday, with the prime minister talking about cheaper healthcare and the opposition leader focused on energy prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nTouring a brewery in Brisbane, Mr Dutton says high energy prices are putting businesses under serious financial strain and promoted his gas plan as the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Groceries are up by 30 per cent. I want to make sure with our east coast gas reservation, we can bring down the price of gas - not just for consumers but because it is a big part of business manufacturing; and the production of electricity as well. And we can have an economy-wide benefit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the plan unveiled in his budget reply speech on Thursday, Mr Dutton has promised to lower domestic gas prices by forcing exporters to divert uncontracted gas to local users.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunities across three states are on high alert for flooding, after days of heavy rain.\n\n\n\n\n\nA severe weather warning is in place for multiple regions in New South Wales, while communities in Western Australia are contending with Cyclone Dianne.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it is Queensland that is bearing the brunt, with the state's worst flooding in more than 50 years expected to take weeks to clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteorologist Jonathan How at the Bureau of Meteorology says it is the state's southeast that will be the most impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Across Queensland there is a lot of tropical moisture across the state. And this will drive widespread rain and storms for much of eastern and central parts. Heavy falls are possible. These are really focused around southeastern parts of the state. As well as the northeast and along the inland New South Wales border. For inland parts of the state (Queensland), rainfall is easing back to showers. But right across Queensland, we are seeing much cooler temperatures than usual for this time of year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has begun ground operations in Rafah\u2019s al-Janina neighbourhood, amid escalating violence across Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's military has issued two more evacuation directives overnight for western Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric says hostilities continue to intensify across the Strip, causing deaths and injuries while severely limiting humanitarian access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that the situation continues to rapidly worsen. Intensified hostilities continue across the Strip, killing and injuring people and severely constraining the ability of humanitarian workers to provide lifesaving support. As we mentioned earlier this week, since the ground operation commenced in Rafah on Sunday, several ambulances belonging to the Palestinian Civil Defence, as well as the Palestine Red Crescent were hit while trying to rescue the wounded and their crew became trapped in the area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the UN, at least 1.9 million people \u2013 or about 90 per cent of the population \u2013 across the Gaza Strip were displaced during the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany have been displaced repeatedly, some 10 times or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities say a strong synthetic opioid - called nitazenes - have been detected in fake oxycodone tablets in New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state's Poisons Information Centre Medical Director Dr Darren Roberts says nitazenes are extremely potent synthetic opioids which are more likely to suppress or stop breathing compared with other opioids, and can stay in the body longer than other drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fake tablets are round and green in colour, and marked with O-C on the front and 80 on the reverse.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Health says this packaging is different to genuine branded oxycodone tablets that are sold under the brand name of Oxycontin.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor support and information on drug and alcohol problems, contact the Alcohol and Drug Information Service on 1800 250 015. This is a 24/7 service offering confidential and anonymous telephone counselling and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIn athletics, Lachlan Kennedy has edged out national record-holder Gout Gout to win the Peter Norman Memorial 200-metre event at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n21-year-old Kennedy achieved a personal best time of 20.26 seconds, ahead of Gout on 20.30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race was Gout's first since he clocked 19.98 seconds to become the first Australian ever to run a sub-20-second 200-metres.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Housing affordability is a red-hot election issue with both leaders making promises to help young people buy a home.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, a far-right vlogger interrupted a press conference being held by prime minister Anthony Albanese, to draw attention to immigration and its impact on housing affordability and medical services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What about the fact that people like us can't get any housing? We can't get rentals anymore,\" he yelled before being escorted out.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater that day, opposition leader Peter Dutton repeated the message that he wanted to be the \"prime minister for home ownership, home affordability and home accessibility\".\n\n\n\nWhat is the Coalition promising on housing?\n\nDuring his budget-in-reply speech, Dutton pointed to several initiatives intended to improve housing affordability.\n\n\n\nCut the permanent migration program by 25 per cent;\n\nStricter caps on foreign students;\n\n$5 billion to fund essential infrastructure; and\n\nAllow first home buyers to access up to $50,000 of their superannuation for a home deposit.\n\nA heckler interrupted Anthony Albanese's press conference on Saturday. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Dutton says his plan to cut the migration program will release around 100,000 homes for Australians \u2014 40,000 in the first year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition leader has so far not revealed what categories of migrants he will cut, but has said this would be revealed before election day.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts have dismissed claims international students are significantly impacting the national housing market .\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have pointed out that allowing first home buyers to use their super for a home deposit will push up prices even further \u2014 although Dutton has argued it would help people get a foot on the housing ladder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scepticism whether Coalition's $5 billion in infrastructure spending will achieve its target of creating 500,000 new homes.\n\n\n\nThe money will mostly be made available to local governments to help fund power, water, sewage and other infrastructure but its success may depend on whether the money is provided via grants, which are likely to be taken up, or by concessional loans.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has called the figures \"fanciful\" and believes the funding would see 70,000 homes would be built at best.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton has also promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from purchasing existing Australian homes for a period of two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has matched this pledge, introducing it in February this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, which Dutton says has not built a single new home, will also face the axe if the Coalition is elected.\n\n\n\nWhat is Labor promising on housing?\n\nLabor has defended its housing fund, which aims to build 20,000 new social housing properties over five years from 2024. It has blamed the Greens and Coalition for delays in getting the legislation passed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If legislation is passed in December 2024 then yeah magically there\u2019s not a huge housing build,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said tens of thousands of homes were under construction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The previous government didn't even bother to have a housing minister, let alone to build any public housing.\"\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese has defended his government's housing record. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch The government says it will also build 20,000 new affordable homes through its National Housing Accord.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its budget, Labor allocated $33 billion to address housing affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes increasing the income and house price caps for the Help to Buy scheme , a shared equity program for first home buyers that sees the government contribute up to 40 per cent of the purchase price.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme supports 40,000 people, and there are price caps of up to $1.3 million in NSW, $950,000 in Victoria and $1 million in Queensland and ACT.\n\n\n\n",

Our plan is to provide a 25 cent a litre reduction in petrol and diesel and unleaded prices. Now that's going to be about $14 a week straight away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton says that will be followed by structural reforms that include the Coalition's gas reservation plan on the East Coast which he says will bring electricity prices down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition Leader has told reporters that before the election he will reveal which visa categories the Coalition would target to cut permanent migration by 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to a question from SBS about whether he is alienating migrant voters he said, 'there are many migrant families I've spoken to around the country who are desperately worried for their kids' as they can't afford to buy a house'.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that 'so many from all parts of our society are experiencing exactly the same as everyone else, and that is that it's tougher to find a house under this government'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nRural communities in northern Western Australia are being warned to prepare for days of isolation after Tropical Cyclone Dianne made landfall early this morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie Johnson with the Bureau of Meteorology says the category one system crossed the coast east of Cockatoo Island and is expected to weaken within hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s moving south and is forecast to pass east of Derby around midday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're talking winds up to a hundred kilometres an hour now that's enough to bring down trees and lines and cause damage to properties. We're also talking about heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding. R rainfall totals of 70 to a 100 millimetres over a six hour period, maybe even up to a hundred and fifty millimetres in that period.

So having that cake and everyone enjoying it at the same time is a wonderful blessing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Andar is self-taught and spends many hours decorating each cake.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith food prices rising she says quality ingredients aren\u2019t cheap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I try and keep the prices low because I am a home baker. I do it out of love. It's not so much for economic gains, but it's my passion, it's my hobby.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Andar is married and raising two children in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile her cakes may be sweet, she remains bitter about the plight of girls in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the three years since the Taliban cut secondary education for women, UNICEF estimates 2.2 million girls have been impacted and by 2030, more than four million girls will have their education stopped at primary school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very um, sad. It's really disheartening to see the women or the girls that had to leave their education half finished. Maybe they will not be able to live the dream that they had of becoming a doctor, for example, or a lawyer. I'm constantly seeing footages of girls crying and they can't finish their studies or they're struggling financially. The women where they have no male guardian, so how are they supposed to support their family?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one reason Ms Andar secretly supports online education for girls in her homeland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are very kind people out there that are trying to help them. And of course my husband and I try to do our bit to support wherever possible. Some kind of education. It could be something as simple as learning English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is decades since Ms Andar and her family fled conflict in Afghanistan, escaping overland on donkeys into neighbouring Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the memories of growing up in Kabul remain vivid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The skies being light up and me thinking that it's fireworks where it was actually conflict going on. And the loud bangs, it wasn't fireworks \u2026 so that's something scary.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney academic Parisa Glass also fled conflict in her homeland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember being very young in Iran and having men surrounding our home, chanting that they want to kill my father and other Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in the community.

    "text": "With the cost of living still biting, the Coalition says it will lower petrol prices if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has proposed halving the fuel excise for 12 months \u2014 dropping it from 50.8 cents a litre to 25.4 cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure is expected to cost $6 billion if it goes ahead, and is touted to deliver taxpayers a saving of $14 per week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in a global context, are Australians really paying too much at the bowser \u2014 and would cutting taxes on petrol actually help ease the pressure?\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition pours petrol on the cost of living debate ahead of the election\n\nWhere Australian petrol prices sit on the global stage\n\nWhile it might feel like your bank account is being drained every time you fill up, Australians actually pay less per litre than many other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to GlobalPetrolPrices.com, the average cost of petrol in Australia is $1.65 per litre \u2014 well below the global average of nearly $2 per litre.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the average is $2.79, while European countries such as Iceland ($3.70), the Netherlands ($3.25) and Italy ($3.04) fork out almost double Australia's rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the United States averages just under Australia at $1.45, with Vietnam ($1.27), Indonesia ($1.32) and Malaysia ($0.73) coming in even lower.\n\n\n\nWhile Australians may feel the pinch every time they fill up, petrol prices in Australia are lower than those in many other countries. Source: SBS News So, are we getting taxed more than other countries?\n\n\n\n\n\nYogi Vidyattama, an associate professor at the University of Canberra's School of Politics, Economics and Society, says Australians are \"in the middle\" when it comes to fuel taxes globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In general and in the world context, the base price is quite similar,\" he says of petrol prices around the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is more expensive than the US, but it's lower than European countries because of that high excise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the European Union, for example, each member state is required to levy a minimum of \u20ac0.36 (61c) per litre on petrol and \u20ac0.33 (56c) on diesel.\n\n\n\nAustralia fares comparatively well when it comes to fuel excises. Source: SBS News John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, says relatively lower taxes are one reason we pay less at the bowser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia has lower fuel taxes than most OECD countries,\" he told SBS News. \"As a result, Australia's petrol prices are less than in most OECD countries.\" The OECD is a grouping of 38 countries with large market economies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to placing these prices against our average wages, Australia starts to fare even better.\n\n\n\n\n\nVidyattama estimates that each household in Australia consumes around 30 litres of petrol a week, which equates to about $60, or 3 per cent of the average income in Australia.\n\n\n\nBut global prices don't tell the full story\n\nWhile Australia may have a lower fuel excise than many countries, that doesn't mean the tax's overall impact on household budgets is small.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one, Australia is a car-dependent country \u2014 far more reliant on vehicles than many other OECD nations, especially those in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even in the US, the level of public transport is much better than Australia, especially outside the capital cities,\" Vidyattama said.\n\n\n\nHawkins agrees: \"Australians drive more than Europeans because our cities sprawl and we don't have as good public transport, making us more car-dependent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2022 Census, the average Australian household owns 1.8 vehicles. More than 90 per cent of households reported owning at least one car, and over half (55 per cent) had two or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just shows how dependent Australia is on the car \u2014 and therefore, on fuel,\" Vidyattama said.\n\n\n\nLooking to save on your petrol prices? Data says you should fill up more often. Source: SBS News \"In some cities like Melbourne and Sydney, there's probably less dependence on cars for daily commutes,\" he added. \"But in other cities and regional areas, car dependence is much higher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also notes that geography plays a major role. \"Where you live and the quality of public transport in those areas affects how much the fuel excise actually impacts your daily budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHawkins adds that Australians also tend to drive larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 another factor in our overall petrol spending.\n\n\n\nSo, would cutting the excise help?\n\nIn its budget reply, the Opposition proposed to cut the fuel excise from 50.8 cents a litre to 25.4 cents. It said the cut would save a driver who fills up the average 55-litre tank each week about $14 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Vidyattama is sceptical. \"I was thinking that the number is inflated,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHawkins says the figures seem to be based on the assumption that households are spending $10,000 a year on petrol \u2014 something that may only be true for a small number of people living outside major cities.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition would dump tax cuts for cheaper fuel as Dutton accused of copying Morrison\n\nAnd, as Vidyattama points out, not everyone will benefit: \"Those who don't drive will see no benefit from the excise drop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the proposed changes might nudge prices down slightly, the savings may not be significant for every household \u2014 particularly those with better access to public transport or lower fuel needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "As he sang the 21st song, Das Wirtshaus (The Inn), of Schubert\u2019s great cycle of mournfulness, Winterreise, Matthias Goerne moved arms, hands and torso with the free expressive grace he had shown throughout the performance, almost as though tracing and amplifying through the air the superb melodic shapes created by his voice. At the piano his co-artist Daniil Trifonov sat implacably immobile, the hymn-like arch of the melody welling and attenuating under his fingers as though controlled solely by concentrated thought. Over and above the artistic calibre of each, the uniqueness of this event was witnessing two supreme artists, each with their own powerful vision and distinct artistic personality, create a masterpiece before one\u2019s eyes. Daniil Trofonov and Matthias Goerne. Credit: Craig Abercrombie With the first song Gute Nacht, Goerne began the cycle with light pleasantly arched line, Trifonov establishing the dull foot-fall rhythm that initiates the cycle\u2019s literal and metaphoric journey, while highlighting accented details with almost morbid insistence. In the second song, Goerne released flashes of anger and wildness, while he threaded fragile lines against Trifonov\u2019s spiky piano part to sinister effect. The turbulent activity of the piano\u2019s right hand in Erstarrung (Numbness), set up a tussle for dominance with the voice\u2019s lower notes. A similar striving was to become evident in the 18th song, Der st\u00fcrmische Morgen (The Stormy Morning), though this was not misjudged balance, but rather deliberately bringing out a struggle inherent in the music.\n\nA different sort of struggle was captured in the cycle\u2019s best-known song Der Lindebaum, in which the quietly nervous agitation of Trifonov\u2019s introduction was answered by superb melodic curves of idyllic beauty from Goerne. In Die Post (The Mail Coach) at the cycle\u2019s half-way point, Goerne made the lines float with a sense of evanescent hope, which Trifonov grounded in stubborn reality with spiky precision. Goerne\u2019s ability to change vowel shape, and inflate lines with dreamy weightlessness while combining with the unyielding rhythmic tread of Trifonov\u2019s chiselled disciplined sound with absolute precision, captured to perfection the combination of hope and despair that underlines Schubert\u2019s conception, nowhere better than in the penultimate song Die Nebensonnen (Phantom Suns). For the closing song Der Leiermann (The Hurdy-Gurdy Man), Schubert empties the music of feeling with a repetitive figure on the piano over a static bass to which, in contrast to his previous rhythmic discipline, Trifonov gave deliberate rhythmic waywardness as though fingers were numb with cold and the controlling mind had departed. After singing without break for about an hour and a quarter, Goerne was still able to inject the muffled closing lines with the subdued richness of fading warmth. Unforgettable. DANCE\n\nSomos\n\nNeilson Studio at Sydney Dance Company, March 27\n\nUntil April 13\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGrowing up in Spain, Sydney Dance Company artistic director Rafael Bonachela listened to flamenco tapes his father played in the car. His father was from Granada, renowned for flamenco music and dance. The teenage Bonachela \u2013 whose dream was to be Leroy from the film Fame \u2013 was more keen on \u201cMichael Jackson, Tina Turner\u2026anything but flamenco\u201d. Decades on and settled in Sydney, Somos (Spanish for \u201cwe are\u201d) is Bonachela\u2019s \u201clove letter\u201d to Spain and the haunting music of his adolescence. It features a remarkably beautiful playlist of Latin music, including flamenco songs, Mexican ranchera music (a favourite of Bonachela\u2019s mother) and covers by flamenco pop legend Rosalia (who in the Spanish-speaking world is often considered to be bigger than Taylor Swift). Somos is Rafael Bonachela\u2019s love letter to Spain. Somos originally premiered in 2023 in SDC\u2019s then newly renovated studios, on a small mirrored stage configured in-the-round. The choice of venue was a pragmatic decision \u2013 at the time, the usual Sydney theatres were booked by other companies. But the cosy venue gives Somos its trademark feeling of closeness, by turns intimate and suffocating. Somos makes the audience feel almost voyeuristic, peering at the dancers through a sheer red curtain (Kelsey Lee\u2019s set design) under soft amber lighting (by Damien Cooper). In the universe that is Somos, everyone seems impossibly beautiful and in a relationship, clad in barely-there mesh and peering through the curtain with smokey eyelined eyes (Lee\u2019s costumes). Here, dancers don\u2019t simply walk, they pace \u2013 with a smouldering, sultry air.\n\nIn its 2023 iteration, Somos was undeniably stylish but became almost superficially one-note in its focus on Spanish sexiness. In this updated version, Bonachela has changed two songs and some of the choreography, giving Somos a far more expansive emotional range and compelling musical variety. You can almost hear the piece opening up and sighing in relief at becoming a little bit more human, a little bit more complex and relatable. There are gorgeous duets and ensemble scenes, featuring incandescent, athletic, impeccably timed partnering. Highlights are the duets from real-life couple Naiara de Matos and Piran Scott, who leap headlong into a fearless series of soaring lifts and turns; and Ryan Pearson and Luke Hayward, whose heart-in-your-mouth finale to Estrella Morente\u2019s cover of Jacques Brel\u2019s Ne Me Quitte Pas sears with push-and-pull vulnerability and cruelty. THEATRE\n\nThe Glass Menagerie\n\nEnsemble Theatre, March 26\n\nUntil April 26\n\nReviewed by HARRIET CUNNINGHAM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Memory is a slippery beast. You reach out and try to grab it, and it either slips away or, at your touch, crystallises into an entirely new thing that is neither truth nor fantasy. You must handle it with the utmost care to protect its fragility or see it shatter into pieces.\n\nI\u2019m in pieces after seeing the Ensemble Theatre\u2019s new production of The Glass Menagerie. Starring Blazey Best as Amanda Wingfield, the family matriarch, and featuring promising debuts from Bridie McKim and Tom Rodgers, Tennessee Williams\u2019 breakout work shakes off the weight of its masterpiece status to become a gripping night in the theatre. Blazey Best stars as Amanda Wingfield, a fading Southern belle abandoned by her husband. Credit: Prudence Upton Amanda Wingfield is a fading Southern belle, long abandoned by her husband. Her two adult children, Tom and Laura, still live with her. Tom has a dead-end job and a yen for travel. Laura is shy and awkward. Meanwhile, a portrait of their father, an alcoholic travelling salesman somehow recast as a hero, lowers over them all. Dreams, memories and fantasies can barely sustain them. Into this bleak house comes a gentleman caller. Jim O\u2019Connor, Tom\u2019s work colleague, is bright and affable and feels like a potential lifeline, but can he handle the glass menagerie without breaking it? Director Liesel Badorrek embraces the poetry and symbolism of Williams\u2019 ravishing prose. Danny Ball, an eloquent and explosive Tom, doubles as Tom-the-narrator, and the decision to have him also voice part of the stage directions offers further layers of meaning. Laura\u2019s tray of glass ornaments glows with its own inward light as action takes place in the shadows (lighting by Verity Hampson).\n\nMeanwhile, a naturalistic setting (costumes and set by Grace Deacon) melts, literally, from the wall-papered backdrop onto the floor, like the cloudy edges of an old photo. Tom\u2019s opening soliloquy drips with Southern vowels, and Blazey Best\u2019s accent is a brittle, fascinating fabrication. Is it too much? The accents, which do mellow across the evening, play at the edge of parody, but perhaps we have to take Tennessee Williams at his word: as Tom-the-narrator says: \u201cBeing a memory play \u2026 it is not realistic\u201d. Best dazzles as Amanda Wingfield, simultaneously exasperated and desperate for her children\u2019s futures. Her range, from coquettish simper to tiger roar, is exhilarating and well-matched by Ball, who takes Tom from poetic malaise to volcanic rage in the blink of an eye. By contrast, Bridie McKim and Tom Rodgers, as Laura and Jim, hold the stage with silences that range from excruciating to magical. They negotiate their dialogue with delicacy and lightness to the point that you almost believe Jim has fallen in love with Laura. The Glass Menagerie is a classic that comes with some hefty baggage of history, not least the shock of 1930s America\u2019s casual racism and ableism. This production pays respectful but not slavish homage to the original to create a compelling piece of theatre for our times.\n\nMUSIC\n\nMJ Lenderman\n\nSydney Opera House, March 25\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 One of the more irritating descriptions of a certain type of, let\u2019s say relaxed rock \u2013 where drawling vocals and dragging rhythms meet solid-state and sometimes squalling guitars \u2013 is the term \u201cslacker\u201d. It\u2019s a phrase that works as a generational putdown (\u201ckids today ...\u201d etc.), and a cool-kids boast (\u201cwe\u2019re above all that\u201d, etc.) and regularly is applied to a lineage running from Neil Young to J Mascis (of Dinosaur Jr) and Kurt Vile to MJ Lenderman. MJ Lenderman and his band. Credit: Jordan Munns The inaccuracy of this term and its assumptions was made abundantly clear four songs into this wonderful night of country-inflected rock from North Carolina\u2019s Catholic saviour.\n\nA man of buoyant hair and sleepy eyes, with a band that look like \u201970s West Coast dudes washed through a \u201990s indie cycle We\u2019d had the low twang opening/hair-tossing climax of Wristwatch, and we would soon get almost funky and definitely bi-coastal with You Have Bought Yourself A Boat, but in Rudolph, there was a definite rhythm and momentum that drove rather than dozed. The fuzzed guitar diversions and snaking lines were ragged and sometimes gnarly; the pedal steel was curly and often tender. It moved air, chugging and chunky enough, but above it all, it was romantic. Not mere heartache but in the idea of the music and its potential to redirect and maybe even change you with energy or hope or succour. It is central to Lenderman: he loves this and believes in it, burrows into it in the new song, Pianos (melody descending, guitar ascending and hitting that War On Drugs sweet spot of blurry power and blissful harmonics) and soaks us all in it with the languorous You Don\u2019t Know The Shape I\u2019m In. It\u2019s why in She\u2019s Leaving You, pushed by solid thumping drums that made the guitar even starker, you couldn\u2019t miss that a Mac-like pop song was barely hiding inside its meatiness. And why a cover of Neil Young\u2019s Lotta Love in the encore was pulled together by a dreamer\u2019s deep affection.\n\nSlacker? Nah, he cares. A lot. La Musica Notturna\n\nOmega Ensemble\n\nCity Recital Hall, March 25\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Cellist and guest director Umberto Clerici joked that he had replaced the first piece on the program, Giovanni Sollima\u2019s Alone with another piece by Sollima, Hell 1, because he had played Alone so often that he was bored with it. Ennui with Alone had apparently subsided by the end, and he played it as an encore. Sollima is a Sicilian cellist and composer with eclectic imagination for local colour and the program showcased another work of his, Violoncelles, vibrez! for two cellos (Clerici and Paul Stender) and strings.\n\nThe program concluded with the Sydney premiere of Everything we hear comes from silence for solo cello, solo clarinet and strings. Hell 1 began with a chant-like melody on solo cello, to which the accompanying string group added modal harmonies, over which the soloist adds decorative embellishment with the chant returning unadorned at the end. Taking its inspiration from Dante\u2019s Inferno, it made the first circle of hell seem more melancholy than torturous and not even particularly unpleasant. Violoncelles, vibrez! began with repeated notes that went out of phase as more instruments joined, creating minimalist textures for the string ensemble. Against this, the solo cellists played languorously sliding sighs that also moved in and out of phase before giving way to more frenetic music. After the sigh-like gestures returned, the piece ended with a pulsating figure on strings drifting away to nothing. Alone, for solo cello, also featured a chant-like melody set in organ-like textures by the idiomatic use of multi-string chords, with the cello\u2019s D string providing a focus and modal centre.\n\nBetween the Sollima works, the Omega Ensemble dipped into the eighteenth century with the fancifully descriptive Quintet, Opus 30, No. 6, La Music Notturna delle Strade di Madrid by cellist/composer Luigi Boccherini and Vivaldi\u2019s Concerto for cello and strings in B minor, RV424. Boccherini\u2019s quintet evoked church bells, dancing, beggars, street singers and soldiers, creating a harmless though inconsequential diversion. Clerici played the solo part of Vivaldi\u2019s concerto with elegance and a strong projection of the music\u2019s gesture and overriding expressive shape. The program concluded with the Sydney premiere of Everything we hear comes from silence for solo cello, solo clarinet (David Rowden) and strings by another cellist-composer, Peter Gregson. The first movement began with a hushed high unison from cello and clarinet, which gradually diverged to create a still, expansive mood like the glistening presence of a dew-covered dawn. The second movement evoked a similar mood in a lower pitch register, while the third opened similarly, then gained in speed for a moment before returning to the glowing, cinematic mood of the opening. Though calming, more variety of mood and texture might sustain a three-movement work better.\n\nMUSIC\n\nRUTHIE FOSTER\n\nThe Lounge, Chatswood Concourse, March 21\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Ruthie Foster wasn\u2019t just born to sing; she was probably already singing in the womb. Music pours from her like water from a tap, and when she turns the tap on full, she makes an astounding sound: a huge, church-bred cry that pierces your very soul. OK, you say, many singers have big voices. The wretched TV talent-quest industry is built on belters. But here\u2019s the thing: when Ruthie hits the big notes \u2013 high, long, and of phenomenal power \u2013 she doesn\u2019t lose the intimacy of when she\u2019s singing softly. It\u2019s the same deal, it just happens to be pushing you so far back in your seat you\u2019re nearly in the lap of the person behind. There were many highlights in Ruthie Foster\u2019s gig. Credit: Lucinda Goodwin Few singers have been able to do that. Aretha Franklin and maybe Sinatra at his best, but it\u2019s a short list. The records of hers with which I\u2019m familiar didn\u2019t prepare me for the fact I was to hear someone live in the memory on the plane of greats like Jos\u00e9 Carreras and Betty Carter.\n\nFoster is from Austin, Texas, the state that\u2019s given us so many great musicians, from Ornette Coleman to Janis Joplin, Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson and Beyonc\u00e9. Like others on that list, she has catholic tastes that emerge both in the songs she writes and in those she covers, so the blues, gospel, soul and even country become one, united by an unfailing feel for a funky groove. The groove comes courtesy of her own guitar (a new, Australian-made model Lloyd Spiegel gave her at the start of this tour) and Scottie Miller\u2019s keyboard. The latter has been her collaborator for 17 years, and it shows. Mostly using piano or electric piano sounds, sometimes with a frosting of strings, Miller colours the songs and solos with panache and adds backing vocals. He\u2019d already proved he was a more than useful operator in an opening solo set, playing his own material. But sometimes, one wished he would just back off the chordal playing enough so we could more readily hear Foster\u2019s slippery, finger-picking grooves. Even better, of course, would be if she\u2019d come with her full band, but that\u2019s a hope for another time. As it was, the highlights were many. Having signed to Sun Records for the Mileage album that just won her a first Grammy (after six nominations), she showed a keen sense of tradition by taking Arthur \u201cBig Boy\u201d Crudup\u2019s That\u2019s Alright (which was a Sun hit for Elvis Presley), slowing it down, and letting it simmer on a funky dialogue between guitar and keyboard. Even better was Pete Seeger\u2019s If I Had a Hammer, again slowed but very insistent, with her voice ringing like some vast bell. Then, on her own Phenomenal Woman, she unleashed the full power of her miraculous singing to such an extent that all that had gone before seemed merely a trickle before the flood.\n\nMUSICALS\n\nGuys & Dolls: Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour\n\nFleet Steps, Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Point, March 21\n\nUntil April 20\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Staged on a giant outdoor floating stage backed by breathtaking harbour views, Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour (HOSH) is one of the ritziest events of the year. The red-carpeted annual spectacular alternates between big-scale operas and lucrative musicals. This year\u2019s was the latter: Guys & Dolls, the 1950 musical theatre classic about a gambler with a heart of gold. Brian Thomson\u2019s successful New York City set is all gritty concrete and smokestacks. The centrepiece is a big yellow taxi, and this year for the first time the orchestra is visible in an overhead gantry, removing previous HOSH latency issues. Jason Arrow as Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Joel Granger as Benny Southstreet and John Xintavelonis as Harry the Horse. Credit: Neil Bennett\n\nIf you like your musicals traditional, Guys & Dolls is for you. It\u2019s a cookie-cutter New York City where men in candy-coloured plaid suits (Jennifer Irwin\u2019s luminous costumes) dance in lines, unironically singing with pork pie hats in outstretched arms. Women have flouncy skirts, tight curls and high 1950s voices. The ensemble (Kelley Abbey\u2019s choreography) is outstanding: the dancing is sharp, unified, bursting with energy. The cast is warm, likeable and strongly voiced. Annie Aitken brings comedic sympathy as Salvation Army heroine Sarah Brown, Bobby Fox creates theatrical depth as craps game organiser Nathan Detroit, and Home and Away starlet Angelina Thomson is an audience favourite as showgirl Adelaide. Cody Simpson looks the part as hero Sky Masterson. Both Thomson and Simpson (a former elite athlete) bring strong physicality to their performances. Jason Arrow, fresh from leading Hamilton, scene-steals as Nicely-Nicely Johnson. His rendition of Sit Down, You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat saves a sluggish Act 2, overflowing with such charisma the audience loses itself cheering and clapping along.

With a pivot in focus and a shift to offering games on TV screens as well, the company\u2019s new head of games has a plan to change that.\n\nAlain Tascan joined Netflix last year, and was previously vice president of game development at Epic Games, where he oversaw the growth of several blockbusters including Fortnite. As president of games at Netflix, he wants to leverage the rise of new technology and industry trends \u2014 which are moving away from the traditional closed-ecosystem console box \u2014 to make the streaming giant a major player in the space.\n\nNetflix has announced a multiplayer online game called Spirit Crossing, developed by Spry Fox.\n\n\u201cI think of games as an extension of the company\u2019s core strength in entertainment. By bringing games into Netflix, we\u2019re creating a place where members can watch, play and experience entertainment all under one roof,\u201d Tascan said.\n\n\u201cGaming is evolving and so are players. People want new ways to play on devices they already own, seamlessly integrated into their lives.

    "text": "Power bank safety concerns have seen the devices banned from use on many world airlines - so when will Aussie carriers follow suit?\n\nAfter a horror incident in South Korea, airlines are cracking down on one popular travel gadget. Source: Getty/AAP\n\nA new safety crackdown is shaking up air travel, with major worldwide carriers slapping bans on power banks in the wake of the fireball incident involving a South Korean airline in January.\n\nThe dramatic shift comes after a portable power bank was blamed for an inferno that engulfed an Air Busan plane in South Korea before takeoff on January 28. Now, airlines across Asia are implementing new laws to prevent another disaster.\n\nCathay Pacific has this week become the latest airline to enforce strict bans, prohibiting passengers from using power banks to charge devices or charging the banks through in-seat USB ports. The power banks are also banned from being stored in overhead bins.\n\nThe bans are already in place on Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Thai Airways, China Airlines, EVA Air and Air Busan \u2014 the carrier that had an aircraft burst into flames on the runway.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTravellers frequently rely on lithium-ion power banks to keep their phones, laptops, and tablets powered during flights. But that convenience could soon be history.\n\nA growing collection of airlines are cracking down on power banks. Source: Getty\n\nWill Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin follow suit?\n\nWhile Asian carriers implement the new bans, Australian airlines Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar are holding their ground\u2014for now.\n\nAccording to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), there are currently no changes to existing regulations, though safety remains a top concern.\n\n\u201cCASA\u2019s policies regarding travelling with lithium batteries, including power banks, align with the guidelines set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA),\u201d a CASA spokesperson told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nThe current guidelines require that all portable electronic devices be subject to specific safety measures to prevent hazards to the aircraft systems from electromagnetic radiation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile CASA bans packing spare batteries or power banks in checked luggage, there will be no change to the rules concerning the onboard use on Aussie carriers.\n\n\u201cAny changes to airline-specific policies regarding power banks are decisions made by individual airlines,\u201d CASA confirmed to Yahoo Australia. \u201cWe encourage all passengers travelling with batteries and power packs to check our website to find out what they can and can\u2019t pack.\u201d\n\nAussie airlines have set out their rules for power banks. Source: Getty\n\nWhat are the rules on Aussie airlines?\n\nWhile Qantas allows passengers to bring power banks onboard, their usage is not recommended.\n\nQantas policy currently states, \"While we don\u2019t recommend passengers use or charge power banks on board, they are not prohibited from doing so except during take-off and landing, in line with aviation regulations\".\n\nOn Qantas, no more than two spare lithium batteries exceeding 100Wh and up to 160Wh are permitted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJetstar offers the same recommendations as Qantas, with its \u2018Dangerous Goods\u2019 website page stating: \"The onboard use of power banks/powerpacks is not recommended\".\n\nJetstar policy also states, \"There are currently no changes to our lithium battery policy however, we regularly review our policies to ensure they remain up to date and compliant with all relevant regulations\".\n\nIt's a similar line from Virgin Australia, with their current rules stating from CASA and other regulatory bodies have not changed, the carrier has no plans to revise its policy related to batteries and power banks .\n\nPower banks to blame for catastrophic incident\n\nJanuary\u2019s catastrophic Air Busan incident at Gimhae International Airport is believed to have started when a power bank caught fire in an overhead bin, forcing the evacuation of 176 passengers and ultimately destroying the aircraft. Investigators later confirmed scorch marks on the charred remains of a power bank.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSafety experts warn that with the increasing number of lithium-ion batteries on planes, more fires are inevitable unless tighter restrictions are enforced. In fact, US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports indicate that overheating lithium batteries on board caused three fires every two weeks in 2024.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have long been flagged as potential fire hazards in aircraft cabins. The batteries can overheat due to manufacturing defects, physical damage or exposure to extreme temperatures.\n\nThe new crackdown has raised some concerns for business travellers and long-haul passengers who depend on portable chargers for work devices, but safety-conscious travellers have a different take.\n\n\u201cI would rather have devices run out of charge during a short flight than set the plane on fire,\u201d wrote one user on Reddit, while another stated, \u201cSuck it up. Read a book or a magazine. Sleep. Meditate. Talk to your travelling companion. Stop acting like a spoiled toddler.\u201d\n\nHow to keep phones charged during long-haul travel\n\nThe local travel industry is now watching to see if and when Aussie airlines will follow the Asian carriers.\n\nPassengers may soon need to plan alternative charging strategies before boarding long-haul flights, such as:\n\nCharge your devices fully before your flight.\n\nUse in-seat power outlets if available.\n\nTurn on battery-saving mode to make your charge last longer.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "Aussie Tesla customers feel 'burned' by the brand's actions ahead of the the release of an updated version of the Model Y.\n\nFootage of a car park full of brand new Teslas has highlighted a major \"issue\" Elon Musk's brand faces in the Australian market. The scene, spotted in Perth, shows hundreds of vehicles parked, with industry insider Paul Maric explaining the cars are in a \"holding yard\" waiting to be sold.\n\nBut with just weeks until the brand new and updated Model Y arrives in Australia, older versions of the vehicle remain unsold. \"All the cars in that video are old Tesla Model Y's,\" Maric, founder of Car Expert, told Yahoo News.\n\nDue to increased competition from rival EV brands and concerns about the founder's US political movements among shoppers, sales of the brand have slumped. It means that Tesla is \"stuck with old stock that no one wants,\" Paul explained.\n\n\"Tesla is in a position now that people are losing interest in electric cars. Sales are plateauing,\" he said. \"They were Australia's best selling electric car but now there are so many others coming onto the market that offer the same tech and features but are more affordable.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaric believes to shift the old stock, they'll \"just keep discounting them\", which he believes results in a loss of trust from customers who bought the cars at a higher price.\n\nHe was visiting Perth for an unrelated event when coming across \"hundreds\" of the cars parked nearby. \"We were doing an event and happened to come across the cars parked,\" he explained.\n\nIn the past, he explained the cars were loaded onto a ship and each car was sold \"as they were coming over\" to Australia. But now, \"demand has dropped off\", meaning the same volume of cars is coming across, but they aren't allocated to a buyer.\n\n\"Now they sit in holding yards,\" he said.\n\nCustomers 'lost trust' in Tesla for slashing prices\n\nMaric says one of the reasons behind Tesla's recent slump in sales is that the brand has \"burned\" its customers, who will now think twice before upgrading to a new version of the car. He owned two Tesla's, first buying a Model Y in 2022 for $72,000. But within two years, the price of his car brand new had dropped by $20,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"When I went to sell the car two years later because it was out of lease, brand new Model Y's were selling for $55,000,\" he said. The move has \"massively increased depreciation\" for those who already own the car.\n\n\"On the secondhand market, people are thinking 'why would I buy your two-year-old Tesla when I could buy a new one for the same price?'\" he said. \"For me personally, I look at Tesla and think 'You've burned me $20,000. Now, instead of people going back and buying another Tesla, they'll go and buy a Chinese brand.\n\n\"No one expects cars to hold their value, but they expect the manufacturer is honest in the way it deals with its customers, if you burn them once they won't come back for seconds. People have lost trust in knowing the cars will hold its value.\n\n\"People due for another car will be thinking twice about whether it's a Tesla.\"\n\n'Hundreds' of Teslas parked in rows in a Perth car park. Source: TikTok/Paulmaric\n\nElon Musk political activities cause for concern\n\nElon Musk is facing one of the most difficult periods as the company's CEO with his new political career at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a White House team tasked with cutting federal spending. The move has coincided with falling sales and increased attacks on dealerships.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaric believes his actions in government and the slump in sales are connected \u2014 and is costing the company. \"All the political stuff with Musk in the states, that's impacting people's choice, and this is the flow on effect,\" he said.\n\nWhile Maric says he's \"the smartest guy in the room wherever he goes\", pointing to his Starlink and Space X initiatives, the reality is \"people don't like his involvement in politics and that's having an effect\". \"It's been a culmination of the things that have led to a sales slump,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to reporters near a red Model S Tesla vehicle on the South Lawn of the White House earlier this month. Source: AP\n\nWhat cars are Australians buying instead of electric cars?\n\nWith charging infrastructure in Australia being described as \"woeful\" by Maric, he believes that Aussies are \"running back to hybrids\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe pointed to the challenges electric car owners face when trying to take long road trips in peak periods as a reason for the shift. Last Easter, chaotic scenes of over 10 Tesla cars waiting to use public charging stations in the rural town of Keith in South Australia, highlighted the issue.\n\nMaric believes that those who are looking to take long road trips will look to hybrid models \"so they can fill it with fuel\" in a pinch. He admits that while charging infrastructure \"may have improved\", so too has the number of cars on the road. \"It's a double-edged sword,\" he said.\n\nTesla Australia was approached for comment.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
