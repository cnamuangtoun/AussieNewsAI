    "text": "A father-of-five who decided to drive through a flooded creek causing his two friends to drown has avoided being sent to jail.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Julia Baly, sitting in Newcastle , said Jawad Al Hussein, 43, had miscalculated the risks when he drove his Mitsubishi Triton ute into the floodwaters as his two friends stood on its tray with a German shepherd dog.\n\nAl Hussein managed to drive two metres before the ute stalled, and he felt the vehicle moving to the left and he lost control.\n\nSydney fathers Bob Chahine and Ghosn Ghosn died in floodwaters in 2022. (Supplied)\n\nHis two friends could not swim and they either fell or jumped from the ute as it was swept downstream by the fast-moving waters.\n\nTheir bodies were found days later having been carried up to two kilometres from the Preston Creek causeway near Goulburn in southern NSW.\n\n\"To my mind, the risks were very obvious,\" Judge Baly said today when sentencing Al Hussein to a 10-month intensive corrections order, 350 hours of community service and two years' disqualification from driving.\n\nAn ICO is considered by the courts to be a prison sentence served in the community under strict supervision.\n\n\"It was dark, the weather was bad, some roads were closed, it had been raining, at times heavily, the causeway was flooded and the water was flowing.\n\n\"Mr Al Hussein had not drunk alcohol or used drugs and he must have been alive to these conditions. He proceeded notwithstanding these obvious and significant risks.\"\n\nThe judge said, in her view, Al Hussein had been overconfident in the ute and his own ability to navigate the situation.\n\n\"Further, it was highly negligent to have two passengers on the tray of the ute knowing that they could not swim and would be directly exposed to the elements.\"\n\nJudge Baly said there had been no rush to cross the causeway to get to Al Hussein's hobby farm a few minutes away when he decided to drive into the floodwaters.\n\n\"The offender was not exercising the degree of care that a reasonable and prudent driver would have exercised in the conditions that prevailed.\"\n\nAl Hussein pleaded guilty to two counts of negligent driving causing the deaths of his friends, Ghosn Ghosn, 30, and Bob Chahine, 32 , on the night of October 31, 2022.\n\nHe had been found not guilty of manslaughter and dangerous driving causing the deaths after a trial in Goulburn District Court in February.\n\nThe judge said Al Hussein was completely devastated and deeply remorseful over the deaths of his two friends and would have to live with what he had done for the rest of his life.\n\nAl Hussein and another man who were in the cab of the ute were able to escape through the car windows and swim to safety before watching their terrified friends disappear into the darkness.\n\nAl Hussein walked for almost an hour trying to get phone reception after the accident before calling triple zero pleading for help.\n\n\"Please help, please help. There's two people dying,\" he told the operator.\n\n\"They went. They're gone. We lost them. I wish we could see them.\"",

It's in the union of people around a common set of values. Now that's all that stands between democracy and authoritarianism. So at the end of the day, all we've really got is each other,\" he continued.\n\nHe later criticised some of the US administration's most recent policies.\n\n\"In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world's poorest children to sickness and death.

They're defunding American universities that won't bow down to their ideological demands. They're removing residents off American streets, and without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now,\" added Springsteen.\n\nThe singer also criticised US lawmakers for failing to protect the American people from what he called \"an unfit president and a rogue government,\" and having \"no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American\".\n\n\"The America that I've sung to you about for 50 years is real and, regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people, so will survive this moment,\" said Springsteen.\n\nThe Manchester show was the first on the European leg of Springsteen and the E Street Band's Land of Hope and Dreams tour, which will also take in dates in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic.\n\nSpringsteen previously criticised Trump and urged Americans to vote for Kamala Harris at a campaign rally for the Democratic candidate last year.\n\nHis criticism of Trump comes after Hollywood star Robert De Niro took aim at the US president at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday.\n\n\"In my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,\" said De Niro.\n\nRobert De Niro accepts the honorary Palme d'Or onstage during the opening ceremony at the 78th annual Cannes Film Festival at the Palais de Festival on May 13, 2025 in Cannes, France (Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)\n\n\"That affects all of us here, because the arts are democratic, art is inclusive and brings people together, like tonight. Art looks for truth. Art embraces diversity, and that's why art is a threat,\" added De Niro, who is an outspoken critic of the US president.\n\n\"That's why we are a threat to autocrats and fascists,\" he added.\n\nDe Niro ended his speech with a call for people to stand up to Trump \"without violence, but with great passion and determination.\"\n\n\"It's time for everyone who cares about liberty to organise, to protest and when there are elections, of course, to vote. Vote,\" the actor added.",

(ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nMr Cooper was convinced something was wrong once he found multiple signs of water leakage through his neighbourhood. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nMysterious water leaks were also drawing attention \u2014 disintegrating asphalt and turning nature strips into swamps in the streets around his hillside neighbourhood.\n\nMr Cooper's curiosity about the source of the water eventually led him to a grated stormwater pit by a nearby highway.\n\nBrett Cooper noticed water flushing through the stormwater system in the hillside suburb of McCrae.

(ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nHomes ruined in wake of disaster\n\nOver days of hearings, the inquiry shone a light on a series of landslides in McCrae on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula.\n\nTwo landslides in November 2022 came a day or so after 80 millimetres of rain had soaked the area.\n\nBut it had been a hot and dry summer when on the evening of January 5 this year, Kellie Moran heard a loud rumbling just outside her family's beloved holiday home.\n\nThe Moran family's home was destroyed in the January landslide. (McCrae Inquiry)\n\nUp to 25 tonnes of material slammed into the dwelling after coming loose from the escarpment \u2014 or slope \u2014 uphill.\n\n\"That was when we noticed greenery, like a tree I suppose, outside the living room window,\" Ms Moran told the inquiry this week.\n\n\"The laundry had sort of been pushed across the hallway.\n\nThe Morans told the landslide inquiry of the mental and financial toll the disaster took on them. (McCrae Inquiry)\n\n\"The laundry door, cupboards in the laundry had come through the wall and we couldn't get access to that end of the house anymore.\"\n\nMrs Moran and her daughter, who was standing in the hallway moments earlier, left nothing to chance and fled.\n\nWhen an engineer inspected the disfigured home in the days that followed, he noticed a steady flow of water coming out of the escarpment \u2014 about 200 millilitres every second.\n\nLoading...\n\nA major landslide obliterated the home on January 14, less than two years after they purchased the property for more than $2 million, and seriously injured a council building surveyor who was in the property at the time.\n\nThe Morans were among several McCrae residents to tell the inquiry about the significant mental, financial and emotional toll the landslides had taken.\n\nPaul and Denise Willigenburg have barely returned to their neighbouring home since an engineering assessment in 2022 found their lives could be at risk.\n\nPaul and Denise Willigenburg have had to move twice due to landslides. (Supplied: Paul Willigenburg)\n\nAs proposed stabilisation works stalled in May 2023, Mr Willigenburg told the inquiry, the couple was at one point told their insurers would not cover the cost of their temporary rental (a decision that was later overturned).\n\nEarlier this year, they were briefly allowed back into their home and found it ransacked. Jewellery, watches and a laptop were gone.\n\nEight properties remain in an exclusion zone established in January.\n\nParts of McCrae remain fenced off.

(McCrae Inquiry)\n\nA former managing director of the local water authority, he didn't stop there.\n\nWorking with an experienced local plumber, John Bolch, on behalf of affected home owners, he visited dams and drains, looked at water flows.\n\nAfter they discovered a potentially burst water main, the pair calculated how much water may have flowed from the site in the five weeks before it was repaired at the end of 2024.\n\nThe figure they produced, reviewed by an engineer, was 54.7 million litres \u2014 or 22 Olympic swimming pools.\n\nThis photo shows a burst water main site at McCrae. Surrounding fallen trees indicate saturation underground. (McCrae Inquiry)\n\nMr Bolch told the inquiry he believed the saturated ground and trench line became \"basically the highway for the water\".\n\nA geotechnical expert the pair briefed theorised that underground water travelled through the area's natural contours, accumulating \"over many weeks, leading up to the January landslides\".\n\nIn a community update after the landslide, South East Water said it began investigating the leaks in November 2024, and water samples indicated the water was not from its network.\n\nMap of the area surrounding the landslide created by geotechnical company CivilTest. (McCrae Inquiry)\n\nSouth East Water managing director Lara Olson said the organisation was reviewing its \"full leak process including the alarms \u2026 and including the process that we usually go through\".\n\n\"We were using our standard practices that had worked previously,\" she said.\n\n\"When I read through the records about what's happened you can see there's a conclusion made using those practices or discussions where our team members conclude that its not our asset that it's ground water or something else.\"\n\nInquiry to report next month\n\nThe burst water main theory is just one of five potential factors the inquiry will consider before it reports next month.\n\nOthers included a natural spring, stormwater drainage, the removal of vegetation at the property immediately uphill of the January landslides and building works in that area.\n\nGerry Borghesi, who owns the home just uphill of the landslide, told the inquiry some trees on his property were significantly trimmed and one removed in 2021.\n\nHe also detailed the installation of two retaining walls in his garden, telling the inquiry a planning permit was not required for the first in 2020 because it was less than 1 metre tall.\n\nThe Penny Lane, McCrae property that fell down the hill as it was pictured when listed for sale in February 2023. (Supplied)\n\nUnder questioning from a Mornington Peninsula Shire lawyer on Thursday, Mr Borghesi admitted he did not apply for a building permit or advise the council of a second, taller wall installed in January 2024, because the height of the retained soil wasn't being changed.\n\nThe lawyer asked the home owner about a number of authorised works at the home.\n\n\"In the course of any of the work that you've done, did you ever seek a report from a geotechnical engineer as to the cumulative impacts of the works on your property to better inform you in relation to any more work you were proposing?\" the lawyer asked.\n\n\"No,\" Mr Borghesi replied.\n\nThe inquiry also heard there was no erosion management overlay over the area \u2014 a council planning tool that can restrict works in landslide-prone areas \u2014 despite it previously being identified as high-risk.\n\nA house slid down a hill and collided with two others in McCrae in January. (Supplied)\n\nThe inquiry has heard how a woman narrowly avoided major injury because of destruction caused by the landslip. (Supplied: Tanina Osborne)\n\nA 2018 review recommended updating the overlays, the inquiry heard, but by 2023 the work still hadn't been funded or carried out.\n\nCouncil staff said they nonetheless imposed additional controls on works in high-risk zones.\n\nMr Borghesi, who is in a VCAT dispute with the council over the 2022 landslide, was one of several residents who spoke of difficulty getting information out of South East Water and sometimes the council.\n\nLandslide risk specialist Darren Paul told the inquiry that a change in underground water pressure was almost certainly a factor in the landslides earlier this year.\n\n\"Water would almost certainly be the trigger,\" he said.\n\n\"A line of inquiry is what might the source of water be.\"",

(ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\n\"I think the fundamental issue that the community has ventilated long and loud, both throughout the election campaign and since then is their concern about the motorsport street circuit,\" she said.\n\n\"Now we hear that the community consultation does go to shaping things like what type of trees you want there, what's important to you, is accessibility important to you, is public transport important to you?\n\nBurswood Park is currently a mix of green spaces and small lakes.

(ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\n\"Oh god no, no, anything but, please \u2026 For many in business there would be a lot of eye-rolling about this, simply because business had hoped that the broad fundamentals were settled,\" he told the ABC's Insiders: On Background podcast.\n\n\"Business has been locked into net zero now for a long time [and] has already made investment decisions predicated on emissions reduction heading towards net zero by 2050. To reopen that now would put a lot of potential investment decisions on hold.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nMr Willox, who is chief executive of industrial business lobby Ai Group, said there was room for debate about how to achieve the target, including the future role of nuclear, but that net zero was a \"north star\" which let the market price and compare alternatives.\n\n\"We have an agreed position that both political sides have settled on for some time, and that's given business and industry some certainty around investment. To go back on that now would make things very difficult.\"\n\nNuclear worth talking about, but not for today\n\nThe Coalition's internal debate about climate policy has spilled out into the open since its heavy election defeat, with both the Liberals and Nationals calling for a rethink.\n\nMatt Canavan, who challenged David Littleproud for the leadership of the Nationals, was explicit that net zero should be dropped and coal embraced, and while his leadership bid did not succeed, his view is shared by several party colleagues.\n\nThe Coalition must figure out its answer to the net zero question Photo shows Sussan Ley, David Littleproud, Angus Taylor, Peter Dutton QT 20221027_041653670_iOS If the two parties found themselves at odds over net zero, can they viably stay together in a coalition?\n\nLiberal views are split between those who want the nuclear power policy ditched for more ambitious emissions reduction policies, those who want it retained but with less taxpayer money involved, and those who want to double down or ditch net zero entirely.\n\nEven moderate Andrew Bragg has welcomed a rethink of that target, while Ms Ley has said energy policy should \"start from the position of affordable, reliable, baseload power\" and consider the energy needs of the manufacturing sector.\n\nMr Willox said certainty about targets was important for the manufacturing sector, not just for investments in energy generation itself.\n\n\"The one thing Peter Dutton said during the election campaign that was right on the money was that energy is the economy, and if we don't have energy right \u2026 Then we're really going to hobble ourselves as an economy,\" he said.\n\n\"Energy is so important to a range of businesses, not just energy-intensive industry or generators or utilities, there is a whole range of things that are at stake here.\"\n\nInnes Willox says Peter Dutton was right to state that \"energy is the economy\", with the viability of energy-intensive manufacturing at stake in the transition. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nHe welcomed the nuclear debate and said there was merit in lifting the moratorium on nuclear energy, but that there were more pressing priorities.\n\n\"The fact is that it is a longer-term option \u2026 Nuclear may have made things easier towards the end [of the transition], but as of now, it's not there. So we have to plan without it,\" he said.\n\n\"What I kept hearing from the private sector was that in the Australian context, nuclear in the time frame that was being talked about wasn't going to stack up \u2026 Business needs to know that projects will be viable for a long time to make the investments they need to make, and at the moment it doesn't add up for nuclear for the private sector.\n\n\"That's not to say that it won't in the future, but we're dealing with the here and now. That's why I think the Coalition went down the path of government funding to try to speed that up \u2026 [But] that changes the ball game when it comes to level playing fields around investment.\"\n\nProductivity needed to unlock the transition\n\nMr Willox said the debate the parliament needed to have was how to achieve the net zero transition, citing regulatory blockages as a major obstacle.\n\n\"The government has, through this last term, had a whole range of objectives around renewable build, and we just haven't achieved that as a country. We haven't built the solar farms, we haven't built the wind that was expected\u2026\n\n\"So we've got to look at a whole range of things around planning, around permitting, around construction time [and] construction cost.\"\n\nMr Willox welcomed comments by Treasurer Jim Chalmers that productivity would be a focus for the Albanese government's second term.\n\nAfter the election, Mr Chalmers had said the economic priority of the second term would be \"primarily productivity without forgetting inflation\", inverting the priorities of the first term.\n\nNew Environment Minister Murray Watt told the ABC this week reforming environment approval laws was one of his \"highest priorities \u2026 Current environmental laws aren't working for the environment and they're not working for business.\"\n\nMurray Watt says environmental approvals are among his highest priorities. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nMr Willox said productivity was \"a very core message\", including in the energy space.\n\n\"We're really interested in what the government is saying it will do with Murray Watt in the environment portfolio, to see how we can unshackle [the approvals process] to allow the build to occur\u2026\n\n\"We have to get the social licence in place, the approvals, the permitting, and we've got to build it \u2026 Or else we're not going to achieve our targets.

    "text": "Victorian councils are \"deeply reluctant\" to enforce the state government's increased emergency services levy as backlash from the agriculture sector intensifies.\n\nThe Victorian government's Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund legislation passed through the Upper House on Thursday night and was met with outrage from some volunteer fire fighters.\n\nThe fund, which replaces the cheaper fire services levy, is designed to raise revenue for fire services, the State Emergency Service, triple-0 and the state control centre.\n\nCouncils across the state are now tasked with collecting the new tax from ratepayers from July 1, despite many local government bodies vehemently opposing the tax.\n\nRegional Cities Victoria (RCV) chair Shane Sali said he was worried some residents would simply refuse to pay the new line item.\n\n\"That's a shortfall on their rates notice which means we have to go through a collection process of trying to get that outstanding money from ratepayers,\" he said.\n\nMr Sali said councils were in the dark around how they were expected to collect and handle any issues with levy payment.\n\nArarat Rural City Council chief executive Tim Harrison said his council was \"deeply reluctant\" to fulfil its legal obligation in collecting the tax.\n\nMayor Jo Armstong said the levy was \"a complete travesty\".\n\n\"It will impact every single resident, from our farmers and those on fixed incomes to local businesses, inevitably causing significant mental and financial hardship and further straining our local economy,\" she said.\n\nMoorabool Shire Council Mayor Paul Tatchell said the change disproportionately impacted rural communities.\n\n\"There are fairer ways to do this and it's a shame the Victorian government is using our rural property owners to claw back some of their huge debt,\" he said.\n\nFarmer and CFA volunteer Prue Milgate says the levy will harm local economies. (Supplied)\n\nA pub with no CFA\n\nFarmers in regional Victoria who already pay substantial rates in addition to volunteering say the new levy will add to their financial pressures.\n\nCentral Victorian farmer and CFA volunteer Prue Milgate said drought-affected farmers were heartbroken about the ripple effect her community would face.\n\n\"That money is what pays my sporting club, it's what pays my children's memberships to our excursions at the school,\" she said.\n\n\"Most farming families \u2026 are already struggling because we've had very little rainfall\n\n\" We aren't going to be able to put money back into our communities. \"\n\nSome CFA volunteers have refused to attend call-outs as an act of protest against the levy. (Supplied)\n\nPeter Shields, who has volunteered for 30 years as a CFA volunteer in Dookie, near Shepparton, says his fellow brigade members are throwing in the towel.\n\n\"I was the only one at the pub last night that wasn't pulling out of the CFA,\" the former Nationals candidate said.\n\n\"But I will not be turning up to any fire on government land.\"\n\nExemption or rebate?\n\nOn Friday Premier Jacinta Allan said CFA volunteers and farmers in 24 shires eligible for state drought support would be \"exempt\" from having to pay the levy.\n\nBut it was later revealed that CFA volunteer firefighters and farmers struggling through drought could apply for a rebate after paying the levy in full.\n\nThat rebate would only apply to a single property.\n\nMs Allan said every dollar raised would go back to emergency services and be reported on annually.\n\nFarmers in parts of Victoria are doing it tough amid a lack of rain. (ABC News: Ted O'Connor )\n\nActing CFA chief officer Gary Cooks said firefighters were pleased the government added some exemptions for volunteers and drought-affected farmers.\n\nBut Victorian Farmers Federal president Brett Hosking said it would be an arduous process for farmers and the CFA.\n\n\"It's an incredibly large burden to place on the CFA, who have enough to worry about already,\" he said.\n\nMr Hosking said the levy would prompt farmers to leave the industry and rural communities.\n\n\"That's one less family employed in the community, less kids in the school, less people at the local shop and less people on the back of firefighting appliances,\" he said.\n\nOptics risk for Labor?\n\nDeakin University politics lecturer Geoff Robinson said the levy could have political ramifications for the state government.\n\nHe said few farmers voted for Labor but some provincial seats held by the government could be impacted.\n\n\"The government does face the potential perception that it is being seen as being very Melbourne-focused,\" he said.\n\nThe government said the new tax was needed to fund emergency services to respond to an increasing number of calls for assistance for fires, floods and extreme weather events.\n\nDr Robinson said the tax could be an example of the cost of dealing with climate change.\n\n\"That puts pressure on all levels of government, particularly on state governments, because they have a limited taxation base as well and often struggle to finance important services,\" he said.\n\nOpposition agriculture spokeswoman Emma Kearley told ABC Radio Melbourne there needed to be more detail about the levy exemptions.\n\n\"It's being oversold,\" she said.",

    "text": "You know someone's all out of runway for their cause when they start throwing around words like \"decency\".\n\nAt the 11th hour to the start of this year's film festival in the glittering French coastal resort of Cannes \u2014 the same town that once banned the public \"modest dressing\" of the burkini from its beaches \u2014 decided to ban overly revealing dresses on the red carpet, all in pursuit of what authorities call \"decency\".\n\nNeither can you wear a long train that will stop \"the smooth flow of guests\". But you must, if you're a woman, still wear high heels as you stumble, sans long gown, up those fabled stairs.\n\nYes, Cannes has always had an eccentric and controlling dress code \u2014 tuxedos only for men, no flats for women \u2014 but when the battleground becomes the body, then forget \"quiet luxury\": for many in the fashion world this new ban is being seen as a kind of quiet conservatism, and a new, insidious surge in the policing of women's bodies.\n\nHeidi Klum appears to have broken the dress code this year with a voluminous train. (Reuters: Stephane Mahe)\n\nExcusez-moi?\n\nIt's the strangest decision. If Cannes has been one thing for the majority of those who are even aware of it, it's a provocative fashion parade of breasts, legs and nipples at every turn. It's the French way, n'est-ce pas?\n\nThe event can expect front pages around the world when models, stars and starlets turn up in see-through frocks and enormous gowns \u2014 Bella Hadid in a 10-denier stocking dress; Irina Shayk in \u2026 duct tape?\n\nOne photographer's close-up at Cannes Photo shows A dog on a stand with film cameras in front of it. Photographer Eric Gaillard has been taking photos at the festival since 1981, when it was a small and intimate affair.\n\nI would have thought that a part of the world that relies for its libertarian fortunes on tax-dodging oligarchs, monarchs and patriarchs can't really afford to stride the wobbly moral high ground of a dress code ban that finds a free nipple the most appalling thing in its sight \u2026 and yet here we are.\n\nBut Cannes has always been a rather weird film festival. It sets itself apart, demanding to be regarded as the most serious and significant cinema market in the world, citing its own revered French film history as its guardrails, and yet it gives an eight-minute standing ovation to the latest chapter of a movie franchise like Mission: Impossible, while celebrating its culture of \"le booing\" to loudly deride other movies that don't land.\n\nActor Sharon Stone arrives for the screening of British director Peter Chelsom's film The Mighty at the 51st Cannes Film Festival in 1998. (Reuters: Eric Gaillard)\n\nA strange hypocrisy\n\nThe hypocrisy of the new ban is almost charming. Cannes is supposed to express the epitome of film culture in any year, and while I don't want to say that Cannes as a festival doesn't seem to know what it's got going for it \u2026 it clearly doesn't. Because why are most of us aware of this two-week spring break for the movie set? Because ever since ambitious starlets of the 50s turned up on the Croisette wearing little more than a cravat for banks of obliging photographers, the main reason anyone outside of the film industry knew the festival even existed at all was because of what women wore \u2014 or didn't.\n\nFor decades, the festival's sexy reputation has derived from hopeful young women willing to come and their her clothes off for a shot at fame.\n\nRobert De Niro hits out at Donald Trump Photo shows Robert De Niro holding up the Palme d'Or with Leonardo DiCaprio clapping beside him, both dressed in tuxes Actor Robert De Niro has come out swinging against US President Donald Trump.\n\nBut clearly, it's taken years for catatonic Cannes authorities to finally express how shocked \u2014 shocked, I tell you \u2014 they must have felt at Jane Birkin's repeated braless wearing of sheer dresses on the red carpet throughout the 70s.\n\nFrance fiercely defends its libertarian reputation and open-minded celebration of the body and will present even its most pervy expressions of that sensibility as a marker of its anti-puritanism and sophistication.\n\nThat 2016 \"burkini\" ban was Cannes giving the French general burqa ban a Riviera touch. Images of armed police officers on the beach forcibly requiring a woman to remove her clothing whipped around the world. Only a city that leans heavily on decades of fame created via breast-baring Brigitte Bardots could twist itself into a logical knot like this.\n\nWhat seems even more hypocritical is the long French tradition of exploiting female nudity in their films: it's galling that Cannes authorities only seem to get the horrors about exposed flesh when it's women and their stylists who are in charge of what gets seen, not a male director.\n\nBella Hadid attended the 2024 festival in a series of sheer dresses including a nipple-baring Saint Laurent choice. (Reuters: Stephane Mahe)\n\nSo, what is this ban really about? It's been a scant seven years since Cate Blanchett led a powerful protest on the Cannes red carpet to highlight the lack of female directors at the festival and in the film industry: Blanchett joined 82 other women, representing the only 82 films by female directors that had competed for the Palme d'Or compared to 1645 by men \u2014 and what's happened in the years since that protest? Virtually nothing has changed. In 2024, only four out of 24 films in the main competition were by women.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Photo shows Virginia Trioli in a stylish suit on a set with lighting behind her Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli.

And as the grip of restraint and control tightens around women everywhere, it's important to remember that.

Whereas some of these people, at times we've had people come who haven't been able to wash their clothes for two or three weeks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 122,000 Australians experience homelessness on any given night . .\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Paulsen says as well as providing a safe space where people can come and look after their cleanliness, the mobile laundry also offers a chance to connect with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While their washing is being done- it usually takes around an hour, an hour and ten minutes. They'll wash and dry them- they can sit and chat and tell us their story, or just discuss general world events. And quite a lot of people will just sit and talk. Quite a lot of them don't even get their washing done. They know we're going to be at a place on a day every week, and they'll come along just for a bit of conversation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating opportunities for connection is also at the heart of 19 year old Rheanca Lincoln's work as a volunteer in her community in Toowoomba.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with a group of other young people, she founded We Are Not Alone , which brings young people with disability from regional towns together for workshops and social events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think loneliness right now is at the highest prevalence in young people, and I think that volunteering can be a really creative way to combat that. Because for me, it really allowed me to break out of my 14 year old shell and see the world from a different perspective, and it really shaped the journey I'm on now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Stephanie Harvey, a Bidjara woman from central Queensland and the CEO of First-Nations-led organisation Community First Development, volunteering is all about these reciprocal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation brings skilled volunteers - from lawyers and builders to engineers and teachers - together with First Nations communities to work on various projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Harvey says the bonds that form between volunteers and communities are key to what makes their projects work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Volunteering in First Nations communities, when it's done the right way, it's not about giving, it's not about welfare, and it's certainly not extractive. It really is about connection and genuine relationships. Our volunteers don't help, they work alongside community members, learning from each other and building relationships. It really is that two-way exchange, where volunteers share their skills and experience, but also gain a deeper understanding of culture, respect and connection.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile around a fifth of Australia\u2019s formal volunteers are involved in community services, welfare, and homelessness, another sector where volunteers make major contributions is emergency and natural disaster response.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmandeep Singh Sidhu from Coffs Harbour is a volunteer with the Rural Fire Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was recently awarded for saving the life of another crew member during a bushfire in the Clarence Valley in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Sidhu told SBS Punjabi about his own decision to support his community to cope with and recover from natural disaster- something he plans to do for as long as he is able to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I joined the RFS in 2020 when I only thought of dealing with the fires around my farm/residence. But later I liked the services that they provide in dangerous and vulnerable situations. I have also served during the Lismore floods in 2022. After that, I decided to join this service forever. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are just some stories from the nearly 6 million Australians who volunteer every year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Volunteer Week celebrates the significant contribution volunteers make to Australian society, CEO of Volunteering Australia Mark Pearce says numbers of volunteers have been dropping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been a long term decline in the rate of what we would term formal volunteering. That is people who volunteer their time through organisations and into community. Percentage wise, there are less volunteers than there were three years ago, five years ago and ten years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBarriers to participation such as out of pocket costs, and reliance on volunteers to deliver essential services without adequate training are some of the reasons Volunteering Australia identifies for this decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Pearce says more funding is needed to ensure those who dedicate their time to helping others can do so in a sustainable and supported way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Volunteering is fundamental to the health and wellbeing every community. As a consequence, the Federal, as well as State and Territory governments have a responsibility to remove the burdens from people who put up their hands and say \"I have a commitment to my community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this Volunteer Week is a chance to stop and think about the stories of dedication and commitment to change behind every volunteer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They give you a sense of what can be done. They give you a sense of what can be done. From time to time we can all feel a bit helpless, volunteering is somewhat unique in giving us the agency to do things that matter to us, to stop that feeling of helplessness and give us an opportunity to be involved. And the stories reflect that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So that one, tumbling it, and of course you go with the flame in there, and that involves a lot of precision, because it can be just overdone or underdone in a few seconds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are around 500 coffee growers in Australia, many of them in northern New South Wales and Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs global coffee prices soar, small plantations like Tibor\u2019s are multiplying.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe describes his as a \u2018hobby farm\u2019, but he\u2019s still producing 500 kilograms of roasted coffee a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nA baker by profession, his first attempts at growing coffee plants weren\u2019t encouraging when they lived in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo coffee starts growing, comes winter, they die. So it happened about three times before I find out they don't like frost. So in the end, I got about a thousand little seedlings, and I brought it up here to Coffs, because my wife is from Coffs, so my mother-in-law is here. And I said, just look after them, water them once a week, and should be all right. So months later, we came back, and the trees were like a couple of foot tall.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process is quite laborious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI handpick all my cherries when they're beautifully ripe. We dry the cherries as well, because we're making the coffee berry tea out of that one, then the beans get dried and then before I roast, they get hulled it means the white shell comes off to get the green bean and then the green bean can be roasted.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTibor\u2019s customers say they love the full aroma of his coffee with no bitterness.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what\u2019s the secret?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Southern Cross University in Lismore, researchers are trying to figure that out.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Tobias Kretzschmar says coffee growing is not new to Australia\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs far as I'm aware, coffee arrived pretty much with the first fleet and there's been attempts since to establish an industry and it's been thriving in the last 20 to 30 years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile producers are happy with the quality of the coffee, he says to make the industry more sustainable, they\u2019re researching other varieties of coffee bush more suited to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem they're having is they put their money on a variety that's much too vigorous for this environment. Keeps growing. It's one of the older varieties that's not dwarfing like the new ones, meaning every couple of years the growers will have to prune it. The tree is stressed, won't produce the next year. So a lot of work and yield losses affiliated with the old varieties.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says a key part of their research is finding out what makes Australian coffee different.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s where his colleague, Dr Ben Liu comes in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we're doing analysis on coffee, trying to understand the flavour and the taste of coffee. At the same time, trying to actually create a chemical fingerprint for our coffee. That means when you have a good cup of coffee or bad cup of coffee, you don't know what's going on there. If you can do a chemical analysis, you know what's in there. So next time you can keep producing a good cup of coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says coffees grown in Queensland and New South Wales have their own individual flavour characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCan be a big difference from farm to farm. Just for example, some of the farms produce coffee. in the far north of Queensland. They produce more traditional coffee flavour, like a cocoa and nutty, those coffee flavour. Here, in the subtropical area in northern New South Wales or southeast Queensland, our coffee tend to actually smell and taste more like fruity and juicy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Tibor\u2019s farm, nothing is wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe sells roasted beans online and at the Sunday morning market in Coffs Harbour.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he makes tea from the dried berries, and flour from the hull of the beans, all full of healthy antioxidants.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the flavour - Tibor simply knows what his customers like:\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News\n\nThe Nordic bloc\n\nSweden and Norway are Eurovision\u2019s ultimate ride-or-die duo.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1957, Sweden has awarded Norway 372 points, and Norway has given back a whopping 550.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two just can\u2019t get enough of each other\u2019s entries, no matter how many sequins or wind machines are involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark, Finland and Iceland are also regular fixtures in each other\u2019s top rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tight-knit Nordic circle has long been known for sending sleek, pop-driven entries and then clapping the loudest when their neighbours do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Eurovision solidarity at its finest.\n\n\n\nMonster rock band Lordi of Finland celebrate their victory at the finals of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest Source: Getty / Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe Mediterranean alliance\n\nTravel south and you'll find another unbreakable bond, this time between Greece and Cyprus.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreece has given Cyprus 522 points since the contest began, while Cyprus has repaid the favour with 544.\n\n\n\nSouthern European countries tend to stick together in voting. Source: SBS News If they could vote for each other twice, they probably would.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbania, Armenia and France also appear high on Greece\u2019s list.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that Eurovision is just as much about politics, culture and community as it is about power ballads.\n\n\n\nThe bloc advantage\n\nEven though Eurovision has introduced a hybrid system combining jury and public votes, bloc loyalty still has weight, especially during the semi-finals, when public votes matter more.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor countries like Australia that don\u2019t fit into a regional alliance, the road to the final can be steeper.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout built-in neighbours ready to throw a few extra points our way, success depends on capturing the hearts of fans and impressing the juries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia may not have a bloc, but we do have big talent.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Residents in a tourist hotspot want free tests for cancer-causing 'forever chemicals' in their blood after a major investigation revealed they had been drinking from a contaminated water supply for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of 15,000 highly toxic, synthetic chemicals resistant to heat, stains and grease, dubbed \"forever chemicals\" because of their inability to break down.\n\n\n\nPFAs detected in Blue Mountains\n\nHigh-level contamination was detected in the drinking water catchment serving 30,000 people in the Blue Mountains in NSW in mid-2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nPFAS levels were found to be about 300 times higher than Sydney's main drinking water source but they still met Australian guidelines for safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nAn eight-month WaterNSW investigation released on Friday zeroed in on three potential sources of contamination \u2014 dating as far back as 33 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo separate motor vehicle accident sites on the Great Western Highway in 1992 and 2002 near the Medlow Bath township, and the Medlow Bath Rural Fire Brigade station were all identified as possible sources of contamination in the Adams Creek and Medlow catchments.\n\n\n\nResidents to pursue class action\n\nJohn Dee, a veteran environmental activist, described the fallout as an \"Erin Brockovich-level scandal\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's leading a group called Stop PFAS that will sue the NSW government and Sydney Water to get free PFAS blood testing for local residents and compensation for those affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People in the Blue Mountains have been drinking toxic tap water for 32 years,\" he told AAP.\n\n\n\nResults of tests paid for by some residents have found PFAS in the bloodstream nearly 50 times the level considered safe by chemicals manufacturer 3M.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the value of individual blood tests is debated among scientists, exposure to PFAS increases the risk of testicular and kidney cancer, affecting the immune system and causing developmental damage in children.\n\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nMedlow Dam and Greaves Creek Dam, of which Adams Creek is a tributary, will remain disconnected from the water supply system, WaterNSW said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dams will only return when permanent mitigation measures are in place.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The new guidelines designed to make your drinking water safer\n\nSteep terrain, potential PFAS spread over a wide geographical region and extensive disturbance of high-value ecological habitat are all flagged as barriers to remediation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Sydney Water said it would work with other agencies to ensure it met the proposed Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.\n\n\n\nIs it safe to drink water from these areas?\n\nHealth authorities say current drinking water meets existing guidelines and is safe to drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the report did not quantify the current rate of PFAS discharge from potential source areas in surface water and groundwater, nor the total mass of PFAS previously discharged.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks to human health and the environment from exposure to PFAS at the source areas have also not been quantified.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter community pressure, Sydney Water installed a $3.4 million mobile PFAS treatment plant at the Blue Mountains catchment in January.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Health and Medical Research Council drafted new drinking water guidelines in October, reducing the benchmark for the PFOA group of chemicals.\n\n\n\n",

But I will find it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter 2: \"How do you feel about that?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nZambotto: \"\"Know, I mean, like, you know, I, we put so much work and effort into everything. And, you know, I talked to my team, and they've, like, you know, it's a hard thing to kind of, you know, see all the work put into it. And me as an individual, but the team, and how proud everyone is of, like, you know, everything we've done. And I know that I couldn't have done anything better. And I suppose I couldn't have worked harder if I tried.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says he has no regrets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aside from, you know, the result this journey has been the most incredible thing that I've ever experienced in my whole entire life. And like, I'm so grateful for that. And you know, the friendships I've made, and, like, even me learning about media training from Clementine and SBS like I was talking to her about that she taught me so much, even just on how to speak to a camera. I was useless before this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis marks the second year in a row Australia has failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir last grand final appearance was in 2023 with metal band Voyager.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Excerpt of Voyager's performance 'Promise')\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most powerful stories this year is that of Ukraine\u2019s entry, rock band Ziferblat.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Excerpt of Ziferblat's 'Bird of Pray')\n\n\n\n\n\nComprising twin brothers Valentyn and Daniil Leshchynskyi, and drummer Fedir Khodakov, Ziferblat are not only competing with their song 'Bird of Pray', but also carrying the emotional weight of war back home.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a Ukrainian cultural event in Basel, the band spoke about their dual mission, music and remembrance.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniil Leshchynskyi: \"A little bit of pressure, yeah, but it's a childhood dream to represent such a big country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nValentyn Leshchynskyi: \"Like we have two missions here because we are representing Ukraine during the war time and so we need to remind Europeans about the war. We started this fundraising company. We need $100,000 to buy a four-robotic system to de-mine Ukrainian territory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were also shaken when their backing vocalist, Khrystyna Starykova, lost her home to a Russian shelling attack just days before their rehearsal.\n\n\n\n\n\nValentyn Leshchynskyi: \"But the day after, she came to us like nothing happened. I mean, she's so strong, she is 19 years old only. But the impact of this situation, I think she won't give up. I mean she knows what to do here, she's focused on the staging. Of course it's difficult when you're losing your flat while you need to like stay calm to celebrate here because it's a musical festival, it's not about the war or something.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe politics didn\u2019t stop with Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside the Eurovision venue, St Jakobshalle, demonstrators gathered in support of Israel\u2019s participation in the contest.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sound of people clapping and singing)\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s act this year is 24-year-old Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the 7th of October 2023 Hamas attack at the Nova music festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Excerpt of 'New Day Will Rise')\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite tensions outside the Eurovision venue, these Israeli fans from Tel Aviv, said they felt supported.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalame: \"The people here are so nice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nZaruk: \"We thought people are going to be louder.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSalame: \"At the beginning, we were kind of afraid to say that we're from Israel. And now everyone who asked us where are we from, we're saying Israel. And they gave us a big hug. Big hug.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers, like Lea Kobler, gathered in support of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It should be a happy occasion that Eurovision is finally in Switzerland, but it's not, it's not. How can we rightfully exclude Russia, but we're still welcoming Israel, who is doing horrendous things to so many people, and we just welcome them here and parade them and say 'oh hello', and they're committing a genocide and war crimes and nobody's doing anything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, voices like local pastor Lukas Kundert emphasised solidarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Jewish people of Basel have heard little in recent days that they are supported here in Switzerland. That they are protected by the population, and this is an opportunity to show that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grand final will be broadcast live on on SBS and SBS On Demand on Sunday 18 May at 5am AEST - and replayed at 7:30pm.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Coin-operated trolleys are a major frustration for many Aussie shoppers but most don't know there's a simple, and free, tool they can get to unlock them.\n\nSupermarkets and major retailers like Woolworths, Coles and Kmart are in a constant battle to ensure shopping trolleys stay where they are meant to be \u2014 in stores. However, a growing trend of locking them up in Australia to prevent them from being dumped is causing growing frustration among shoppers who rarely have a $1 or $2 coin required to operate them.\n\nRecently, regular Woolies shopper Stefan was fuming after his arm was hurting from having to lug a heavy basket around the store to do his weekly shop because he didn't have a coin on him to access a trolley.\n\n\"My arm was killing me,\" he told Yahoo News of the ordeal, admitting that he \"never\" holds coins on him.\n\nHowever, after sharing his gripe online, Aussies informed Stefan of a little-known gift from staff at Woolies which solves the annoying problem \u2014 a keyring token which can be used to release the trolley without a gold coin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I went up to the desk and asked, and they were like 'here you go' and gave it to me,\" he explained, asking, \"how did I not know about that?\"\n\nWhile the supermarket remained tight-lipped about the free item when approached by Yahoo News, it's understood customers who don\u2019t have a coin to use for the trolley locks are welcome to enquire about the tokens.\n\nWhy are trolleys being locked in Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and Kmart?\n\nTrolley dumping is a widespread issue, with supermarkets spending \"significant amounts\" on maintaining their fleets. Brisbane-based Ocean Crusaders' Ian Thomson recently told Yahoo it costs roughly $300 to replace a trolley, and stores \"don't do much\" to recover missing ones.\n\n\"That's often being paid for with our groceries,\" he said, suggesting it's everyday Aussies who bear the brunt of the ultimate costs of the problem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nColes recently told Yahoo News they have teams of people collecting trolleys removed from the premises.\n\n\"Abandoned trolleys are a nuisance to local communities and we are continually working to make this better across all our stores, including regular collections of abandoned trolleys with vehicles on the road frequently,\" a Coles spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are always reassessing our trolley management and take local feedback into account when deciding what methods to employ at any of our stores, including the use of coin locks and electronic wheel lock systems.\"\n\nAldi's 'preventative measure' against trolley theft\n\nAldi, well known for using coin-operated trolleys, told Yahoo News Australia they too use them to prevent trolleys being dumped, as well as to save money.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The Aldi trolley token system is a key preventative measure against trolleys being dumped in backstreets, waterways and public areas. As a result, we find almost all of our trolleys are returned to our stores,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"By incentivising customers to return their own trolleys, we save money on trolley retrieval services and pass those savings on to customers in the form of our low prices. It\u2019s part of our Good Different operating model.\"\n\nThe store sells a trolley token for 99 cents.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Source: Supplied/Adidas\n\nAnimal rights campaigners are claiming victory after Adidas announced it was no longer using leather harvested from wild Australian kangaroos. Pressure had been mounting on the German-based sporting manufacturer to cease using the product in its soccer boots because of animal welfare concerns.\n\nUnited States-based Center for a Humane Economy has run a high-profile campaign, highlighting concerns about a lack of oversight when kangaroos are shot, and that joeys are considered collateral and bludgeoned to death. In 2023, Puma, Nike and New Balance abandoned the product, commercially known as K-leather, and switched to synthetic alternatives, which they said were superior.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News from Frankfurt on Friday night, Center for a Humane Economy president Wayne Pacelle said the company\u2019s sudden announcement came as a \u201csurprise\u201d, but it was welcome. \u201cIt was time for this very strong global brand to divorce itself from the largest massacre of terrestrial wildlife in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Adidas used only a small amount of kangaroo leather in its shoes, a decision from such a high profile company is set to be a blow to the industry's morale. Advocates of wild kangaroo shooting claim their product is better for the environment than farmed alternatives like cow leather and that it can be done sustainably without harming the species' overall health.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Australian Wild Game Industry Council argues shooters kill in a way that \"minimises pain, suffering and distress\". \"The methods for the euthanasia of joeys in instances where they are unintentionally orphaned are also based on scientific research into kangaroo behaviour and ecology,\" it maintains.\n\nApplause as Adidas CEO announces end to kangaroo leather\n\nAdidas CEO Bj\u00f8rn Gulden announced the decision on May 15 at the company\u2019s Annual General Meeting in F\u00fcrth, Germany.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that we don't need to discuss this anymore because we haven't bought any kangaroo leather since August last year,\u201d he said in German. In video of the speech, seen by Yahoo News, members of the 250-person strong crowd can then be heard erupting in applause.\n\nGulden then confirms the last shoes from that shipment are being produced now, meaning there may still be some stock available.\n\nAdidas had already scaled back its use of K-leather, but was continuing to use it in soccer boots. Source: Adidas\n\nGulden's announcement was preceded by a 6-minute address by Pacelle, who had travelled from Washington to speak before the board. Dressed in a suit and tie, and standing at the podium, he delivered what he \"hoped\" would be a \u201cvery rational argument\u201d on animal welfare and why choices made by large commercial brands like Adidas matter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nContinuing, he claimed the conditions of the slaughter did not meet Adidas\u2019s own animal welfare standards, and that shooting kangaroos to make football boots was \u201cno longer acceptable in the 21st century\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to use kangaroo leather, it is completely unnecessary. If we take an honest look at what\u2019s happening with these animals, we know that this is no longer justifiable,\u201d he added, before reminding the board that in the United States, animal welfare has more donors than any other cause.\n\nAdidas claims kangaroo decision not influenced by campaign\n\nFollowing Pacelle\u2019s speech, Gulden denied Adidas\u2019s decision to stop purchasing kangaroo leather was influenced by Center for a Humane Economy\u2019s campaign, or that kangaroos were directly shot to make shoes.\n\n\u201cWe don't agree on the matter because you know the meat industry is responsible for regulating the population,\u201d he said in German. \u201cShoe production uses waste products, so we'll see now because I hope you come every year, and then we can see if it improves just because we don't make the shoes.\u201d\n\nAustralia is home to the largest slaughter of terrestrial wildlife in the world. Source: Getty (File)\n\nSpeaking later with Yahoo, Pacelle said leather was a valuable component of what makes kangaroo shooting viable, noting the flesh is not sold at a high price, with much of it used as pet food.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe was \"baffled\" as to why Adidas took so long to make the announcement, given K-leather hadn't been purchased since last year.\n\nProtests had been ongoing at stores across the United States, with activists entering shops with placards and calling on the company to abandon its use of kangaroo. \"These have created a lot of clamour within the company, and it is definitely behind Nike in the United States, which is definitely an important market,\" Gulden said.\n\nAnimal rights advocates celebrate around globe\n\nKangaroo continues to be used in luxury handbags and boots, and by Japanese sporting goods manufacturers Mizuno and ASICS. Center for a Humane Economy is now turning its attention to these shoe brands, and will work to fight any industry expansion into other international markets like China.\n\nAnimal welfare groups around the world have celebrated Adidas\u2019s announcement, which was the most high-profile sporting company to continue selling K-leather boots.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCenter for a Humane Economy\u2019s director of international programs Jennifer Skiff told Yahoo that today had been \u201ca good day\u201d.\n\nSpeaking after the AGM she said, \u201cAdidas\u2019s decision marks a historic milestone in animal protection and corporate responsibility. This sends a clear message: compassion is not a compromise. Cruelty has no place in commerce.\u201d\n\nDonny Moss from TheirTurn, a group that led dozens of protests in Adidas, said, \u201cThis win belongs to every advocate who stood outside a store, signed a petition, or raised their voice\u201d.\n\nAnimal welfare advocates claim it\u2019s unethical to bludgeon joeys to death after their mothers are shot for their meat and skins. Source: Getty (File)\n\nIn Australia, Animal Justice Party MP Emma Hurst celebrated the decision, calling it a win for \u201ctransparency, ethics, and global consumer expectations\u201d.\n\n\u201cAustralians and animal lovers worldwide owe a great deal to the relentless work of the Center for a Humane Economy and the global coalition that made this possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAlyssa Wormald from the Victorian Kangaroo Alliance said it's time for leaders in Australia to see the \"writing on the wall\" and realise the kangaroo harvesting industry is \"dying\".\n\n\"We know the reduced demand for kangaroo products is hitting the kangaroo industry hard. Very few processors are buying carcasses, so shooters are packing it in, and there is no incentive for new shooters to get involved,\" she said.\n\nAdidas has been contacted for comment.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

Source: Shire of Augusta-Margaret River\n\nA new speed reduction trial is being rolled out on roads in one Aussie state and despite the initiative being a desperate attempt to curb growing road fatality rates, there has been a mixed reaction to the move, which will cost drivers 90 seconds on the road.\n\nAround 550 local roads in the popular Margaret River region of Western Australia will be affected by the three-year Safer Speeds program, with the first of the new speed limit signs sprouting up in Gracetown this week. While there is no blanket speed change across the roads, the majority are being reduced by 10 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe Shire of Augusta-Margaret River has remained steadfast on its decision to introduce the changes despite the neighbouring City of Busselton council pulling out of what was due to be a joint program, with 1,800 roads in that council area now no longer due for a speed limit change.\n\n\"The intent was to have the trial over the two shires, but City of Busselton decided not to. Their community response to participate in the trial was quite different than ours,\" Shire President Julia Meldrum told Yahoo News. \"Over 50 per cent of our community were happy for us to proceed with the trial, which was a different result than the City of Busselton.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The reason we're involved in this trial is because speed is one contributor to road crashes and serious injury, so it's one way of saving lives.\"\n\nResidents pose with new speed limit signs erected this week. Source: Facebook/Shire of Augusta-Margaret River\n\nSpeed reduction program called out as 'joke' by some drivers\n\nThere has been a 10.4 per cent increase in the number of roadside fatalities in Western Australia in the last 12 months, according to the National Road Safety Strategy, and speed continues to be the leading cause of serious collisions.\n\nHowever, some drivers are pushing against the speed reduction trial, claiming it will increase travel time and is only going to \"frustrate people\" \u2014 with many sharing their opinions on social media, calling the trial an \"absolute joke\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Absolutely needless and just more infuriating and impatience will build for road users,\" one driver said online, with many championing the City of Busselton's decision to pull out.\n\nIn response, Meldrum told Yahoo News the average travel time will only increase by 90 seconds and she strongly believes the road safety implications of reduced speed limits will vastly outweigh the slight increase of time on the road.\n\n\"I'm encouraging community members to be patient on the roads and be sensible on the roads. And, you know, is 90 seconds really a long time? Not really. It's insignificant when you consider there could be lives saved and serious injury prevented.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
