(Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nUnder the AUKUS agreement, the Australian navy will acquire eight nuclear-powered (but not nuclear armed) submarines over the next decade from the United States and Britain.\n\nThe federal government says 5500 jobs will be created at the shipyard, with thousands more \ufeffindirect roles stemming from the shipyard's construction programs.\n\n\"This is a driver of not just of national security and how were going to defend our nation into the future,\" Albanese said.\n\n\"It's also a driver of our economic prosperity, as well as making such an enormous difference to some of the apprentices that we've met here today.\"\n\nSpeaking alongside the prime minister, Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy said the Adelaide shipyard would be the only in the southern hemisphere capable of constructing nuclear-powered submarines\ufeff.\n\nAustralia will acquire US-built Virginia-class nuclear submarines under the first stage of the AUKUS agreement. (US Dept of Defence) (US Department of Defence)\n\n\"Importantly, this will modernise Aussie manufacturing as we go through it because it's not just the 10,000 jobs here,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got 70 companies already going through the qualification process to win work supplying not just Australian submarines but UK and US submarines.\"\n\nAUKUS was signed five years ago by the leaders of Australia, the US and UK in a move aimed at deterring China's assertiveness in the Pacific.\n\nDoubt over the future of AUKUS emerged last January when US President Donald Trump was sworn in.\n\nHe ordered a review of the defence pact by the Pentagon, concerned it did not meet his \"America first\" agenda.\n\nThe agreement hung in the balance for months until the US Defence Department gave the green light in September. \ufeff\n\nLater, Trump warmly endorsed AUKUS when he hosted Albanese at the White House, saying it was \"full steam ahead\".",

    "text": "NSW will have an extra public holiday on Anzac Day weekend for the next two years, Premier Chris Minns has confirmed.\n\nPreviously in the state, if Anzac Day on April 25 fell on a weekend, there would not be an official public holiday.\n\nHowever, Minns announced this morning the government will implement a trial that will see the state gain a public holiday on April 27 this year and April 26 next year.\n\nThis is because Anzac Day falls on Saturday and Sunday for the next two years.\n\nThe premier insists Anzac Day itself will remain a solemn occasion. (Sam Mooy)\n\nThis is now in line with Western Australia and the ACT , which have already implemented an extra public holiday when Anzac Day falls on a weekend\ufeff\n\nMinns believes the holiday will allow people to spend more time with their friends and families, while not detracting from the importance of Anzac Day itself.\n\n\"We believe that this additional public holiday was the right thing to do,\" he said. \"This cannot detract from the overall importance of Anzac Day, I don't think it will.\n\nMinns conceded some business owners would not agree with the decision.

    "text": "Sam Mackaway's future has been planned for as long as he can remember.\n\n\"I always wanted my family to grow up on a farm,\" he says.\n\nHe's a third-generation cattle farmer in Walcha, New South Wales, and now with a young family of his own, he's realising his dream.\n\n\"The property's been in our family for 27 years. It's 2,800-and-a-bit acres and a beautiful part of the world to raise my kids,\" he tells ABC iview's Muster Dogs.\n\nSam Mackaway wouldn't want to raise his kids anywhere else. (ABC/Ambience Entertainment: Brook Rushton)\n\nEventually, Mackaway will inherit the family business, but it comes with conversations about succession, debt and leaving his mark.\n\nAccording to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, seven out of 10 businesses in Australia are family-owned.\n\nWhile family businesses are in every industry, 25 per cent of workers are in agriculture, forestry and fishing.\n\nCorrina Wright is the sixth generation to run her family's business, Oliver's Taranga Vineyards in McLaren Vale, South Australia, and says it's a privilege to continue the legacy.\n\n\"You're very lucky that you've landed in the spot where you are and being able to be part of such a long family lineage,\" she says.\n\n\"But then there's a little bit of pressure in that, because you don't want to be the generation to stuff it up.\"\n\nCorrina Wright works closely with her cousins on the family business. (Supplied: Gilbert Bages)\n\nEyes on the future\n\nWhile Mackaway always knew he wanted to settle on the farm, he had to work hard to earn his place.\n\n\"My brother and I got told when we were younger that we needed to go and do something before we came back to the farm, we needed to get a trade or go to uni or just do something, because anything that you come back with to the farm helps,\" he says.\n\n\"I was quite keen on becoming a sparky [electrician], so I moved away and did that. I don't use it every day, but I use it quite a lot on the farm, just being able to make stuff.\"\n\nDespite the generations of knowledge passed down, Mackaway knows he needs to look to the future if he wants the business to thrive for years to come.\n\nModernising the family business is one way Sam Mackaway is securing the farm's future. (ABC/Ambience Entertainment: Brook Rushton)\n\nIn doing so, he's introduced modern technology into his day-to-day work.\n\n\"I'm driving around in a tractor with a GPS and auto steer, whereas Dad's driving around in a tractor just using his eyes, trying to see the lines,\" he says.\n\nWhile his father is an expert in using machinery to move cattle, Mackaway has taken on the challenge of learning how to introduce working dogs onto the farm.\n\nHe's also introducing a data-tracking system to streamline his processes, which will enable him to track cattle weights and growth, as well as lineage and which bulls are working with which cows.\n\n\"I'm a few weeks away from releasing a farm management app. We do have a fair few headaches just tracking our cattle.\"\n\nIn Wright's family business, each generation has brought its own focus to the business. In her case, it was expanding from just selling grapes to starting their own brand.\n\nCorrina Wright's business has evolved in the hands of her generation. (Supplied: Gilbert Bages)\n\n\"You've gone from a business that didn't really care about what happened at the farm gate, your grapes were gone, and you didn't need to worry about marketing or any of that sort of stuff,\" she says.\n\n\"Now you're running a business that can employ a whole pile of different people, not just tractor drivers, and you've got customers coming to you, and you've got marketing to do, you've got design and social media and all those sorts of things \u2014 the generational difference is huge.\"\n\nThose changes took a little while to get used to.\n\n\"The pressure back in the early days was to not stuff that up and to respect the family name that was going on a wine label,\" Wright explains.\n\n\"Now I feel a bit more proud that our generation has been able to contribute significantly to assisting the business and strengthening it into the future as well.\"\n\nPlanning ahead\n\nEvery five years, Mackaway sits down with his family to discuss succession planning.\n\nHis father's own experience has influenced the handover process with his son.\n\n\"My grandfather decided that he wasn't ready to retire. He wanted to keep going for a bit longer, and Dad thought, 'I'm going to be 65 by the time you want to retire and not run [the] place how I want to run it'. So he's very aware of that in the discussion about succession planning.\"\n\nBut while family businesses can bring some challenges, Mackaway says having family support has offered vital help with the costs of expanding and setting up the property he owns with his wife, Laura.\n\n\"As long as we're happy to all work together, we can get that debt down a lot quicker than if Laura and I were to move away and do our own thing. That'd take us a long time.\"\n\nSam Mackaway plans to continue working with family. (ABC/Ambience Entertainment: Brook Rushton)\n\nFor Wright, she says it's been important to have advisers who are non-family members, to keep their vision on track \u2014 but she's looking forward to creating opportunities for more family members in the future.\n\nAnd while past generations were limited to farming work, roles could now be anything from a graphic designer to a lawyer.\n\n\"Legacy just means we've left it in a better spot than what we received it,\" Wright says.\n\nHer daughter is already working for the company one day a week.\n\nMeanwhile, for Mackaway and prospects of a fourth generation in the business, only time will tell.\n\nStream the new series of Muster Dogs free on ABC iview.",

(Suppled: Liz Denyer)\n\nThe 51-year-old is among a small but growing number of marathon swimmers who take on open-water swims longer than 10 kilometres.\n\nMs Denyer said conditions for her Cook Strait crossing on February 9 were \"magnificent\", except for the masses of stingers.\n\n\"They got me everywhere. There was a bit of swearing going on,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't count, there were lots.\"\n\nIt took Ms Denyer eight hours and 20 minutes to swim the strait, covering 26.6 kilometres in total due to currents.\n\nThe Cook Strait is 22km at its narrowest but swimmers cover longer distances due to currents. (ABC News: Sharon Gordon)\n\nAbout 30 people complete the Cook Strait crossing each year. It is one of seven open-water swims that form a marathon swimming challenge known as the Ocean Seven.\n\nIn 2023, Perth swimmer Andy Donaldson set the record for the fastest crossing in four hours and 33 minutes.\n\nTesting her limits\n\nMs Denyer said the swim was about putting her body to the test, but she did not let the adrenaline stop her from appreciating her surroundings \u2014 despite the water being 14 degrees.\n\n\"I looked ahead and there was this beautiful sunrise \u2026 this is why I do marathon swimming,\" she said.\n\n\" The water was calm and glassy and beautiful. \"\n\nIt was those positive thoughts that helped her keep swimming in a straight line for the next eight hours, she said.\n\nLiz Denyer's father Tris and his wife Gail were part of the support crew. (Supplied: Liz Denyer)\n\nHer support team, including her former coach as well as family and friends, accompanied Ms Denyer by boat, throwing her food every 30 minutes and providing encouragement during the entire swim.\n\nBitten by the bug\n\nAlthough Ms Denyer lives and works as a radiation therapist in Townsville, her passion for marathon swimming was kindled far away from her tropical hometown when she joined a London swimming group in 2017.\n\nSoon after Liz Denyer began her Cook Strait swim she encountered many bluebottle jellyfish. (Supplied: Liz Denyer)\n\nOn her first day, another member told her he had recently swum 46 kilometres around Manhattan Island, to which Ms Denyer responded: \"Why would you ever want to do that?\"\n\nBut it was not long before she said she was \"bitten by the bug\" and decided to swim 14.4 kilometres across the Gibraltar Strait later that year.\n\nShe then ticked off the 33-kilometre English Channel in 2023 and the 32.3-kilometre Catalina Channel in 2024.\n\nAfter finishing the Cook Strait, Ms Denyer's eyes are set on the final three Ocean Seven swims \u2014 the North Channel between Ireland and Scotland, the Molokai'i Channel in Hawaii, and the Tsugaru Strait in Japan.\n\nLiz Denyer works as a radiation therapist and trains before her shifts. (Supplied: Townsville Hospital and Health Service)\n\nA growing sport\n\nMs Denyer is the typical demographic of a marathon swimmer, according to Marathon Swimming Australia president Christian Renford.\n\nHe said participation across Australia was growing and skewed towards people older than 35, as the sport had a low impact on the body.\n\nChristian Renford says marathon swimming is increasing in popularity. (Supplied: Christian Renford)\n\n\"We've got people as old as 65 floating around still doing some stunning and absolutely remarkable swims,\" he said.\n\n\"When people get a bit more mature in age, you like to set those goals that are very much aspirational.\"\n\nHe said marathon swimming appealed to people because completing the swim was more important than speed.\n\n\"It's not about the time, it's about the distance,\" he said.",

(ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\nThe shipyard's developer, Australian Naval Infrastructure (ANI), a company owned by the federal government, estimated the next stage, an outfitting area, would cost $8 billion to build, while an area for consolidation, testing, launching and commission would cost more than $15 billion.\n\nThe state government estimated at least 4,000 workers would design and build the submarine construction yard, while 5,500 workers would support nuclear-powered submarine production at its peak.\n\nThe SSN-AUKUS submarines are based on the design of the British Astute-class submarine. (Supplied: British High Commission)\n\nLong time frame for delivery\n\nThe submarines are being built as part of the $368-billion AUKUS submarine pact announced in 2021.\n\nIt replaced a deal to build French-designed submarines, also in Adelaide.\n\nThe first part of the plan is for Australia to buy between three and five nuclear-powered submarines from the US, beginning in the early 2030s, including at two second-hand Virginia-class submarines.\n\nFive of the eight SSN-AUKUS nuclear-powered submarines are due to be delivered by the middle of the 2050s, with the final three delivered in the 2060s.\n\nVice Admiral Jonathan Mead from the Australian Submarine Agency points out different parts of the new shipyard. (ABC News)\n\nVice Admiral Jonathan Mead, the director-general of the Australian Submarine Agency, said experts from the US and the UK had been in Adelaide advising the build.\n\nHe said the manufacturing process at Osborne would be \"identical\" to the shipyard building submarines in the UK.\n\n\"Their facilities are 120 years old; ours will be the most modern submarine yard in the world,\" Vice Admiral Mead said.\n\nAUKUS deal details The final details of Australia's first nuclear submarine fleet have been unveiled \u2014 along with the price tag.\n\nMr Albanese said the construction work and then the work building submarines would provide thousands of jobs into the future in Adelaide.\n\n\"If you're a 15 or 16 year old thinking about what am I going to do with my life, you can be assured that there will be well-paid, secure jobs here in Adelaide and you'll get \u2026 that satisfaction of seeing what you are creating as a product of your labour and knowing that it is very much your contribution as well to our national interest for decades ahead,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"We do live in an uncertain world, but we can be certain of the economic benefit to the tune of $30 billion going forward here in South Australia.\"\n\nPremier Peter Malinauskas talks about the planned expansion of the Osborne shipyard. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\nMuch larger than frigate work\n\nMr Albanese met with South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas for a media conference at the Osborne South shipyard five weeks ahead of the state election.\n\nMr Malinauskas said the investment at Osborne South, where six Hunter class frigates are being built, was \"extraordinary\" but it \"pales into insignificance\" compared with the work for the AUKUS submarines.\n\n\"[We're] here to announce arguably the most structurally significant contribution to our economy that we will ever see,\" Mr Malinauskas said.\n\n\"What has been announced today completely dwarfs some of the investments that we've seen in South Australia's recent past \u2014 that boggles the mind.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Ashton Hurn pointed out the AUKUS deal was signed by the former Coalition federal government.\n\n\"I'm really hopeful that South Australian businesses can feel a part of this project,\" Ms Hurn said.\n\n\"It's really important that we don't just become a glorified IKEA where we're bringing in products from right across the world and just assembling them here in South Australia\n\n\"We need to be at the heart of this manufacturing opportunity, because that's what will set us up for generations to come.\"",

The Victorian senator was unceremoniously turfed from Sussan Ley's ministry after being tarred personally with much of what went wrong in the Coalition's cataclysmic loss.

    "text": "With the ABC's three Perth radio stations switching from AM over to the FM band, it is the end of an era for the 94-year-old transmitter in Hamersley.\n\nWhile it is a well-known landmark in Perth's northern suburbs, Trevor Kelly has had a view of the Hamersley transmitter few others have.\n\nHe started working as a radio technician for the ABC in 1959, as a trainee with the Postmaster General (PMG), which then handled all the ABC's technical broadcasting requirements.\n\nTrevor Kelly, retired ABC radio technician. (ABC News: Pip Waller)\n\n\"We were taken out to 6WF, Hamersley \u2014 out in the sticks \u2014 and we were shown the transmitters,\" he said\n\n\"The ABC 6WF transmitter was one built in about 1932 by the PMG itself.\n\n\" Then we were taken out to this great big mast and asked, 'Would you like to climb it?' \"\n\nWhen Mr Kelly and the other trainees said yes, they were given permission but also instructions on how to do it without electrocuting themselves.\n\n\"They said, 'Just be very careful when you get on; you've got to jump on, not touch the ground and the mast at the same time, otherwise you'll be electrified,' that was the word that was used then,\" he said.\n\n\"So we all jumped on, and as you jumped on, there was a zip as you touched on there.\n\n\"Eleven of us managed to get up to the top, but you couldn't go right to the top because again, you got electrified there.\n\n\"Anyhow, we all got down and it was a memorable day.\"\n\nThe Hamersley transmitter is 94 years old. (ABC News: Pip Waller)\n\nIt has been many decades since ABC staff were allowed to risk electrocution at work, and now, the site's days providing AM broadcasting are drawing to a close.\n\nABC AM stations move to FM\n\nABC Radio Perth, NewsRadio and Radio National will all move to frequencies on the FM band on February 23.\n\nThe move will mean \"many more people can tune into the station\" as well as hear a clearer sound, radio futurologist James Cridland said.\n\nMr Cridland, who also edits a daily podcast newsletter, said he thought the switch for ABC Radio Perth from AM to FM would be really good for the ABC.\n\n\"It's really important to make sure that the primary emergency broadcaster is available in a way that people can actually pick it up, and that, for the most people, is FM radio,\" he said.\n\nPerth is the first capital city in Australia to move all stations to FM, a move that matches global trends.\n\nJames Cridland says moving to FM will boost listening in cars. (Supplied)\n\n\"If you look into Europe, most of the big broadcasters have now left the AM band,\" he said.\n\n\"Japan is just turning off AM for one of its national broadcasters. In much of the US, they are trying, as quickly as they can, to shift over to FM.\"\n\nCrucially, moving to FM will boost listening in cars, a key audience for all radio stations.\n\n\"New electric cars have no AM [receiver] in them. They're pulling AM out of some hybrid cars as well,\" Mr Cridland said.\n\n\"We here in Australia get the European version of cars in terms of the in-car entertainment, and AM is not a thing in most of Europe, in much of the UK, so car manufacturers have no reason really to put it into their cars anymore.\"\n\nSwitching towers\n\nFor BAI Communications area manager Tim Gray, who has been involved with ABC broadcasting for 40 years, it has meant preparing an FM mast at Bickley, in the Perth Hills, for the new services.\n\n\"The transmitters are all being installed, all ready to go, ready for switch on, and we've had a significant project to upgrade the antenna system and the combiner system to combine all the new frequencies into the system,\" Mr Gray said.\n\n\"It's quite exciting. The team have put in a lot of work.\"\n\nTim Gray says it is an exciting milestone. (ABC News: Pip Waller)\n\nAlthough he admits there is a small part of him that is sad to see the ABC depart the Hamersley site.\n\n\"This tower has been very significant in broadcasting ABC Radio Perth AM. It's part of the skyline, of Perth,\" he said\n\nDue to legislation that stipulates NewsRadio must broadcast parliament on AM radio, that station will be simulcast on both bands until the law can be amended.\n\nEquipment inside the plant room at Hamersley transmission tower. (ABC News: Pip Waller)\n\nMr Cridland said while AM still had a crucial place in regional Australia, where it can reach vast distances and is less susceptible to interference than it is in the city, FM made much more sense in the city.\n\nFAQs: Moving from AM to FM Will I need to buy a new radio?\n\n\"[In cities] we live in suburbs. We commute into the CBD. You don't need a large transmitter to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"What you need is a transmitter that people can actually pick up the signals from in their car and in their house. And more and more these days, that's FM and not AM.\n\n\"It's something that, frankly, the ABC should be doing in all of the capital cities.\"\n\nABC Radio Perth will be on 102.5 FM, Radio National to 103.3 FM and ABC NewsRadio to 104.1 FM from February 23.",

And I think this has got the potential to be something big.\n\n\"I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be every year.\n\n\"Maybe if the player interest does wane a little bit, maybe then you think about adjusting it, but I can't imagine that being the case.\n\n\"I think it will only grow legs. I mean, as a coach, I think it's the best time now in pre-season.\n\n\"For example, our players have a practice match against Hawthorn on Monday. I know where I'd rather my players be playing.\"\n\nImportantly, players from both sides went all-out in their attempt to win the game, and a number of the league's biggest stars have already signalled their desperation to represent their state next year.\n\nScott said WA had the \"front running\" to host Origin again, given the way fans in the state embraced it, but he knew there would be other states knocking down the door to take part.\n\n\"It really has got some potential,\" Scott said.\n\n\"If you were a South Australian-aligned player or an Allies-aligned player, you had to watch that game thinking, 'How can you leave us out of this contest?'\"\n\nCox is equally optimistic about Origin's future.\n\n\"I think State of Origin should be every year,\" Cox said.\n\n\"It's for the AFL to work out who plays in that, whether it's a carnival, whether it's a standalone game.\n\n\"The WA government, WA Tourism and the WA public showed that they'll support it no matter what time of the year it comes, and they probably deserve to hold it.\"\n\nNot one AFL star who was fit and eligible to play for either Victoria or Western Australia turned down the opportunity to take part.\n\nThe huge buy-in from players was arguably the biggest reason for the concept's success, and even the glut of injuries to come out of Saturday's game did not dampen the excitement.\n\nCarlton defender Jacob Weitering was taken to hospital with possible neck, rib and shoulder damage after being crunched in a marking contest.\n\nAdelaide recruit Callum Ah Chee, Port forward Mitch Georgiades and GWS defender Sam Taylor had their games cut short due to hamstring niggles, while Gold Coast's Brownlow medallist Matt Rowell injured a finger.\n\nNevertheless, Hogan said the players had embraced the concept.\n\n\"This year was a little bit of the unknown,\" Hogan said.\n\n\"I mean, all the players were excited for it, but we weren't really sure what to expect.\n\n\"As we were getting closer, as the teams getting announced, the excitement kind of grew.\n\n\"I think everyone that played under-age footy or wants to play for their state or watched tonight. I think this could blossom into something special.\n\n\"There's absolutely no reason why the players wouldn't want to buy into this every single year. Hopefully it's here to stay.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "After years of delays, the rail routes of Western Australia's resource-rich Pilbara are starting to whirr with the sound of battery-electric power.\n\nFortescue launched two battery-electric locomotives this week, rounding out its fleet of 70 diesel-powered machines hauling precious iron-ore from pit to port.\n\nFortescue put its latest battery-electric locomotives on show in Port Hedland. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's mining giant is the second of the region's major companies, and among its largest carbon emitters, to test the technology.\n\nBHP began its own Pilbara trials of battery-electric trains in November.\n\n\"We'll test them with our conventional fleet and we want to understand exactly [their] performance \u2026 then we'll pull the trigger on a fully decarbonised solution for rail,\" said Fortescue chief executive Dino Otranto.\n\nRarely caught short on spectacle, the first of the blue-and-white locomotives pulled into Port Hedland's Thomas Rail Yard to rock band Wolfmother's 2005 hit, Joker & the Thief.\n\nThe locomotive's battery is the equivalent of \"200 to 300 average electric vehicles\" and capable of powering a refrigerator for 30 years, according to Mr Otranto. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nThe locomotives, purpose-built by Caterpillar subsidiary Progress Rail, boast what Fortescue has called the world's largest land-mobile battery, with a capacity of 14.5 megawatt-hours.\n\nThe pair will save the company 1 million litres of diesel each year, still just a fraction of the 80 million litres the company consumes annually.\n\n\"It is a large undertaking: these take probably a couple of years to manufacture, so once we pull an order, you can see it will take a couple of years to transition the entire fleet,\" Mr Otranto said.\n\nThe company hopes to complete the transition ahead of its \"real-zero\" deadline of 2030.\n\nFortescue back on track\n\nThe locomotives' massive battery will be charged in two ways.\n\nThe first is via Fortescue's growing renewable energy apparatus, which it says it is expanding aggressively at a rate of more than 3,000 solar panels a day.\n\nFortescue plans to totally electrify its transport network over the next \"couple of years\". (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nThe second charging method is through regenerative braking, a mechanism drawing closely from the company's stalled \"Infinity Train\" concept.\n\nAndrew Forrest had previously touted an in-house electric rail model, developed with Australian engineering firm Downer Group, that generated all the power it needed using the uphill-downhill dynamics of the Pilbara ranges.\n\nThe project was canned, however, in September, axing more than 100 staff.\n\nThe significance was not lost on rail operations specialist Ryan Coy, who was among the locomotive's first drivers. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nRio Tinto mothballs electric rail\n\nLike its homegrown competitor, Rio Tinto has long emphasised the importance of rail to its decarbonisation efforts.\n\nThe British-Australian multinational ordered its first battery electric locomotives from American manufacturer Wabtec in 2022 and pledged to roll them out in the Pilbara in 2024.\n\nThe transport of Pilbara iron-ore spans more than 2,000 kilometres of privately owned rail. (Supplied: Rio Tinto)\n\nThe eventual replacement of more than 200 diesel locomotives was supposed to slash roughly three per cent of Rio Tinto's total emissions, although that milestone is far off.\n\nThe ABC understands Rio Tinto recently shelved its partnership with Wabtec.\n\n\"While battery locomotives represent an important area of technological development, our analysis indicates that current battery technology is not yet viable for our Pilbara rail operations,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPeter Newman was critical of Rio Tinto's reluctance to pursue battery-electric rail. (ABC News: Benjamin Gubana)\n\nCurtin University professor of sustainability Peter Newman slammed the company's \"backwards step\".\n\n\"They will regret not going down this net-zero path quickly because it is going to be cheaper, better for their markets, better for their company in general,\" he said.\n\nRace to decarbonise\n\nThe Pilbara region produces about 40 per cent of WA's carbon emissions, despite being home to just 2 per cent of its population.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly produced by the iron-ore industry, from which a quarter of the state's annual revenue flows.\n\nFortescue has developed rows of BYD battery banks to store solar energy collected near its Iron Bridge mine. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nBHP vice-president of operational decarbonisation Daniel Heal said the company's own Wabtec locomotive prototypes were undergoing \"no-load commissioning\".\n\n\"The intent is that we'll have those pulling iron ore in the Pilbara in the coming months,\" he said.\n\n\" Diesel, for us, contributes about two-thirds of our emissions today. \"\n\nBHP said its Wabtec locomotives were still a long way from implementation at scale. (Supplied: BHP)\n\nMr Heal could not point to a fixed timeline for the trials and stood by the miner's decision to slash its decarbonisation budget.\n\n\"We've moved that funding to the 2030s \u2026 the engineering challenges mean it's going to take probably a bit longer than people anticipated.\"\n\nFortescue's solar farm near the Iron Bridge mine. (Supplied: Fortescue)\n\nDr Newman said Fortescue was not without criticism, accusing the company of neglecting \"straightforward, practical solutions\" for \"wasteful\" projects it had since abandoned.\n\nThe company has walked away from a host of green hydrogen projects in recent years, including a multi-billion-dollar hydrogen electrolyser plant once spruiked to be a global pioneer.\n\nMr Otranto defended Fortescue's record with the new locomotive looming behind him.\n\n\"We have not slowed down with hydrogen whatsoever. In fact, our green iron plant at Christmas Creek in the Pilbara will be using Australia's largest liquefied hydrogen plant to produce green metal,\" he said.\n\nFortescue is resolute that it will reach its goal of zero carbon emissions with zero offsets by the end of the decade.",

Up until a shock retirement in 2023, he represented Norway, the country of his birth.\n\nHowever, five months after hanging up the skis, Pinheiro Braathen was back on the international circuit, but this time in the colours of Brazil, for whom he is eligible through his mother.\n\nTwo years later, Pinheiro Braathen is a history maker, and in no doubt about his decision.\n\nUpon winning gold, he collapsed onto the snow, overcome with the enormity of his achievement.\n\n\"I've tried over and over again to put words to what I'm feeling, but it's simply impossible,\" Pinhero Braathan said.\n\n\"If there is anything that I hope I can be as a source of inspiration today, it's that you dare to be who you are.\"\n\n3. Cheating curling chaos\n\nCurling's international governing body says it will have officials monitoring for rule violations during the rest of the competition after Sweden's men's team accused Canada of cheating in a tense round-robin game.\n\nTensions boiled over when Brad Jacobs's Canada beat Sweden 8-6, with Niklas Edin's rink alleging their opponents were double touching the stone during the contest.\n\nCanada was embroiled in curling controversy in Italy. (Getty Images: Andrew Milligan/PA Images)\n\nWorld Curling has introduced electronic handles on stones at the Games, which flash red if players are still making contact with the stone beyond the hog line \u2014 the point where curlers must let go during delivery.\n\nHowever, \u200cthe sensor for detecting violations is in the handle, with Sweden claiming Canada's players were touching the granite, where there are no sensors.\n\n\"It is not possible for World Curling to have game umpires positioned to observe all hog lines for every stone delivery,\" World Curling said in \u200ca statement.\n\n\"However, beginning with the Saturday afternoon session, two officials will move between all four sheets and observe deliveries.\"\n\nGet the latest: Winter Olympics day eight live updates: Anthony wins historic gold for Australia Stay across the highs and lows of the Games with the ABC Sport Daily podcast and ABC Sport.\n\nAfter Sweden \u200cand Canada asked officials to keep an eye on their opponents' deliveries early on, there was a heated exchange between the teams' thirds Marc Kennedy and Oskar Eriksson towards the end of the game.\n\nEriksson told Kennedy he would show him a video replay of him touching the stone repeatedly.\n\nThe Canadian responded with an expletive.\n\n4. Skier breaks ski, still claims silver\n\nEbba Andersson was forced to race with one ski for 30 frantic seconds. (Getty Images: Alex Slitz)\n\nSweden was favourite heading into the women's 4x7.5-kilometre team relay, but its hopes of finishing atop the podium were all but dashed in the second leg.\n\nEbba Andersson crashed forward dramatically, not only losing ground on her opponents but breaking a ski in the process.\n\nRising from the snow, she was forced to hobble along with just one blade for 30 bizarre, painstaking seconds.\n\nAnd the comedy of errors was only added to when a member of the support team, racing to restore Andersson's symmetry, slipped in their haste.\n\nHowever, Sweden wasn't done there, responding impressively to claim silver.\n\n5. More injury pain for Australia\n\nLaura Peel officially withdrew from the Games on day eight. (AAP Image: Dan Himbrechts)\n\nOn day eight, Milano Cortina officially became Australia's most successful Games in history.\n\nBut amid the ecstasy of Jakara Anthony's history-making dual moguls gold was another little bit of agony for an already injury-ravaged Australian team.\n\nAustralian aerial skier Laura Peel was the latest athlete to be forced to withdraw from the Games, following an injury sustained at a training camp in Switzerland earlier this month.\n\nNursing a torn ACL, the two-time world champion and genuine medal contender was always facing an uphill battle to prove her fitness, but she was understandably \"heartbroken\" nonetheless.\n\nPeel is the fourth Australian to have their Olympic dreams dashed by injury in recent days, with Cam Bolton fracturing his neck in training, Misaki Vaughan being concussed during her preparations and Daisy Thomas belatedly succumbing to a reinflammation of her ACL injury.\n\nABC/Reuters",

    "text": "People with disabilities in remote Northern Territory communities are being targeted by unscrupulous NDIS providers using high-pressure sales tactics and inducements including cash, cigarettes and alcohol, an ABC investigation can reveal.\n\nDisability workers say they are witnessing aggressive recruitment of clients and the rapid draining of funds from plans, amid a rush of new providers into the outback NT market.\n\nThe ABC has obtained a dossier of complaints, compiled into a report, that has been sent to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which is responsible for regulating providers.\n\nThe document paints a troubling picture of predatory behaviour by companies looking to exploit \"high value\" customers in remote Aboriginal communities in the NT, where plans can be larger to account for the expense of remote service delivery.\n\n\"People are being promised phones or KFC to change providers,\" one anonymous NT disability advocate said.\n\n\" It's happening every week. \"\n\nNow, some Territorians living with disability are speaking out about their experiences.\n\nDo you know more? Contact reporter James Elton on elton.james@abc.net.au, or, if you require more secure communication, on jameseltonabc@protonmail.com\n\n'I didn't know what it was for'\n\nJalkie Rickson said she was sitting in a front yard in her small Top End community of Wugularr, about 400 kilometres south-east of Darwin, last year, when she was approached by a woman she'd never met, who wanted her to sign an NDIS service agreement.\n\nJalkie Rickson says the unknown woman approached her and pushed her to sign an NDIS service agreement (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nMs Rickson, who has limited mobility and uses a walker, was already receiving NDIS support through other carers.\n\nShe said she did not understand the document being presented to her, and the woman did not explain it.\n\n\"She told me to sign up. But I didn't know what it was for,\" Ms Rickson said.\n\n\" She just told me to sign. She wasn't explaining why \u2026 she never said: 'This is what you're signing for'. \"\n\nDespite her reservations, Ms Rickson eventually signed the form.\n\nJalkie Rickson's disabilities mean she can't walk very far without help. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nThe provider later returned, Ms Rickson said, and drove her in a car to another town about one hour away.\n\nMs Rickson can't recall exactly when, but at some stage she alleges the carer also gave her a pouch of tobacco.\n\nMs Rickson says she did not understand at the time that the carer was about to place her in a live-in home in the town.\n\n'In there, there's not any hope'\n\nOnce there, she quickly became concerned about the level of care in the home.\n\n\"[The carer] just left me \u2014 left us there and took off to go wherever she want, you know?,\" she said.\n\nMs Rickson's disabilities mean she cannot walk very far without support.\n\nShe said the carer did not facilitate any trips outside, making her feel like she was being treated like a \"slave\" or a \"hostage\".\n\n\"In there, there's not any hope. You cannot go out. Just gotta sit. Watch TV. Make tea,\" she said.\n\nJalkie Rickson says making tea was one of the few things she was able to do inside the live-in home. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nAfter a short while living in the home \u2014 Ms Rickson estimates between four days and a week \u2014 she made a call and arranged for someone to come and pick her up.\n\nMs Rickson then phoned the carer to cancel her service agreement. The carer told Ms Rickson she would visit her again in Wugularr soon to collect $140 to pay her back \"for the smokes\".\n\n\"Some people, they get greedy,\" Ms Rickson said. \"They love the money, most.\"\n\nBernadette Wallace, an NDIS support coordinator who had been managing Ms Rickson's care up to that point, said the experience was a \"total rug pull\" for Ms Rickson's existing providers.\n\nBernadette Wallace found herself cut off from accessing Jalkie Rickson's online NDIS portal. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nShe found herself cut off from accessing Ms Rickson's online NDIS portal.\n\n\"I didn't even know where to send anything, to be able to have a handover so then they could be aware of what's already in place,\" Ms Wallace said.\n\nAfter meetings with NDIS representatives, Ms Rickson was able to return to Ms Wallace and her other previous providers.\n\nAn associate of the carer who picked up Ms Rickson told the ABC the matter was under investigation by the NDIS regulator, so the company was unable to comment.\n\n\"We have fully cooperated with the Commission and provided all requested documentation,\" the associate said.\n\n\"We categorically deny the allegations of high-pressure sales tactics, inducements, or any breach of the NDIS Code of Conduct.\"\n\nAccess to alcohol\n\nIn the Northern Territory, most Indigenous communities are dry. Buying alcohol on behalf of others is a serious offence.\n\nBut there are reports that some NDIS providers are facilitating access to alcohol to win over and retain customers in the bush.\n\nFloyd Rose, a Warlpiri man from the dry community of Lajamanu on the northern edge of the desert, says last year he witnessed an NDIS provider for his late disabled mother providing alcohol to her and members of his extended family.\n\nFloyd Rose says he saw an NDIS provider facilitating access to alcohol for his mother and members of his family. (ABC News: Jayden O'Neill)\n\n\"His role [was] to look after her, bring her up, take some family out,\" Mr Rose said.\n\n\"Most of the time he [goes to] Lajamanu, go round there, take some people \u2014 but not safe I think, with grog.\"\n\n\"Why this fella buying grog every day for this mob?\"\n\nMr Rose said he felt the man did not appear to have the right motivations for an NDIS provider.\n\nFloyd Rose says the man providing alcohol to community members doesn't sit right with him. (ABC News: Jayden O'Neill)\n\nThe ABC has seen two invoices texted to Mr Rose's mother by two separate providers in February 2025.\n\nThe first was for $10,494 for five days of care from February 3 to February 7, while a second was for $5,659 for a single day of care on February 18.\n\nMultiple disability workers have told the ABC those amounts could only be justified by intensive, one-on-one care, and even then they would be a stretch.\n\nOne of the providers that billed Mr Rose's mother told the ABC while they would not comment on the individual case, they specialised in high-intensity respite care that could attract high rates.\n\nFloyd Rose is from the dry community of Lajamanu. (ABC News: Jayden O'Neill)\n\nGifts a widespread practice\n\nMs Wallace, who has worked as a support coordinator for clients in remote NT communities for the past nine years, said the use of gifts to recruit people to sign with NDIS providers was becoming a familiar story.\n\n\"The participants that I'm looking after, they've directly admitted to receiving tobacco, receiving free rides to places, receiving alcohol, [and being] induced by actual cash payments,\" she said.\n\n\"That's obviously to cajole them into having them as a provider.\"\n\nBernadette Wallace says NDIS providers targeting vulnerable remote participants with gifts is a growing problem. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nA dossier of complaints, which does not include Ms Rickson or Mr Rose's experiences, has been compiled by disability advocates and the Darwin Community Legal Service (DCLS).\n\nThe report also draws on conversations with legitimate providers and disability advocates working across the territory.\n\n\"Participants are offered food, cash, phones, gaming consoles, furniture or vouchers to switch providers or sign up for the NDIS,\" the document reads.\n\n\" These inducements have high appeal to people living in poverty who may have low English language or literacy skills and can't understand the consequences of the 'deal'. \"\n\nThe report, compiled by disability advocates and the DCLS, outlines the widespread use of inducements and draining of NDIS plans in the remote NT. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nAs well as the Commission, the document has also been sent to federal NDIS Minister Jenny McAllister.\n\nA spokesperson for the minister said Ms McAllister was \"very aware\" of the issues with the NDIS in the territory and had asked for \"further advice from agencies\" on how to address them.\n\nCash for introductions\n\nIsaac Dai, a Torres Strait Islander man who married a desert woman from Lajamanu, says he and his brother were last year approached by a provider and offered $200 cash payments each in exchange for introductions to disabled people in the community.\n\nIsaac Dai (right) says he was offered cash for introductions to disabled people in the remote community of Lajamanu. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nLajamanu is extremely remote, located more than 600 kilometres away from Katherine, the nearest regional centre.\n\nMr Dai said the pair agreed and introduced the woman to two disabled residents.\n\n\"She told us 'I'll come back and pay you $200 dollars each',\" Mr Dai said.\n\n\"But she didn't \u2026 we didn't see her from then.\"\n\n\"Didn't pay us. She just signed up the two person and gone.\"\n\nIsaac Dai (left) says he feels the provider was only really interested in getting signatures. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nMr Dai said the woman made commitments to return and assist disabled residents with cleaning their houses. But he said he was sceptical that the work would actually be done.\n\n\"This is a robbery going on. This is playing games. She just wants people's signatures, that's all,\" Mr Dai said.\n\nPlans being 'drained'\n\nOnce an NDIS agreement is signed, it means companies can start invoicing for services and drawing down funds from a participant's plan.\n\nBut the report by the NT disability advocates found some providers operating in remote communities were signing up clients and then burning through funds much too quickly, by invoicing for far more care hours than their plans could support \u2014 a tactic known as \"overservicing\".\n\nIn some cases, the hours of care billed may not even have happened.\n\nThe NDIS is designed to give people living with disabilities access to choice and control, including by making it easy for them to change carers. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\n\"Once participants are signed up, their plans are drained of funds, the support they were promised never materialises, and they are left isolated and uncared for,\" the report reads.\n\nAn anonymous Tennant Creek service provider said they had seen plans that \"should last a year\" being \"drained in two months\".\n\n\"Then people have nothing left and no way to pay for help,\" the provider said.\n\nAn anonymous Darwin disability advocate told a similar story.\n\n\"We see plans emptied in weeks,\" they said.\n\nMs Bowker said there was a \"glut of service providers clamouring to get these clients\".\n\n\"I think these dodgy providers see these participants as cash cows,\" she said.\n\nAgainst the code\n\nThe use of gifts like cigarettes, alcohol and cash is against the NDIS Code of Conduct, but falls in a legal grey area.\n\nThe Code says these methods are unethical and dishonest, but \"not necessarily unlawful\".\n\nNew NDIS provider rules confirmed in major shake-up The government confirms two categories of NDIS providers will be subject to mandatory registration from July 2026.\n\nGareth Trew, a support coordinator for well-respected Katherine service provider Step Out, said there were \"absolutely no circumstances\" where it was okay to use inducements.\n\nMr Trew said many participants were already very vulnerable to being tricked into signing agreements they didn't understand, due to factors like poor literacy or intellectual disabilities.\n\n\"Predatory providers who spot that? Absolutely, there's huge scope for them to take people's money,\" Mr Trew said.\n\nRachael Bowker, the chief executive of DCLS, said providers were offering items that could be \"extremely expensive and hard to get hold of\" in remote communities.\n\n\"At that very moment, sure, why wouldn't you take a phone or alcohol or cigarettes?,\" she said.\n\nRachael Bowker is concerned vulnerable people in remote communities are being taken advantage of. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nClaims of ineffective complaints process\n\nAdvocates and providers across the NT said they were losing faith in the NDIS complaints process.\n\nThe NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission \"rarely follows up on serious complaints\", according to the report.\n\n\"It's quite concerning that these providers, who are repeat offenders, continue to operate without any sanction at all,\" said Scott Richardson, a disability advocate based in Alice Springs.\n\nScott Richardson wants more to be done to deter providers from preying on vulnerable Territorians. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nLast year, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission received 409 complaints in the Northern Territory. But it has confirmed roughly half of those have yet to be \"processed\".\n\nFamilies at breaking point ahead of defining year for NDIS Families frayed by NDIS cuts are bracing for even more change ahead of a year that's set to reshape the scheme into something more sustainable, write Nas Campanella and Evan Young.\n\nThe online register of banning orders shows there are only a handful of people who have been banned from operating under the scheme in the NT, in a market with more than 2,400 active providers.\n\nThe Commission told the ABC it could not comment on individual complaints, but said it was increasing its enforcement activities in the territory.\n\nA spokesperson said its investigators had been to Tennant Creek and Alice Springs in December, carrying out dozens of site visits and executing warrants in response to complaints about providers in the region.\n\nCalls for tougher enforcement, cooling off periods\n\nThe disability advocates said an independent investigative body for the territory should be set up if \"inaction\" by the regulator continued.\n\nThe report also argued tactics like inducements should be made \"reportable incidents\" under the NDIS Act, and for the introduction of a \"cooling off period\" for people switching providers.\n\nThe National Disability Insurance Agency, which is responsible for implementing the NDIS, said it had zero tolerance for providers offering incentives or referral payments.\n\nThe spokesperson said their own investigations had found a \"strong link\" between such practices and fraud.\n\nThey said the agency was aware of \"challenges in the NT market\" and was in the middle of a review of \"cross agency intelligence\" including tip-offs.",

From Fred Schepisi\u2019s 1987 romcom, Roxanne (starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah), to Virginia Gay\u2019s cross-gendered queer Cyrano at the MTC in 2022, the story has a performance history as long as its hero\u2019s nose. Mark Yeates (Cyrano) and Callum O\u2019Malley (Christian) in a scene from Cyrano De Bergerac at fortyfivedownstairs. Matthew Chen This free adaptation from playwright Martin Crimp was staged on the West End and Broadway a few years back, with James McAvoy in the title role, and now comes to Melbourne in a bold indie production with a cast much larger than any of our main stages could afford to muster. Those who felt that Gay\u2019s version for the MTC shortchanged Rostand\u2019s poetry may take heart at the obsessive centrality it assumes in Crimp\u2019s \u2013 the retention of rhyming couplets; the vision of Cyrano as spoken-word maestro, bounding across the stage versifying, mic in hand; even a poem composed (after Emily Dickinson\u2019s Because I could not stop for Death) on the field of battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who enjoyed the playfulness of a woman as Cyrano, on the other hand, and the undemanding romcom vibe Gay brought to the stage will be struck by the contrast here. The production has playful moments, but they\u2019re locked within an epic dismantling of traditional masculine ideals. Mark Yeates leads a bare-chested, knife-wielding, testosterone-drenched deconstruction that hacks away at the very notion of the heroic and leaves an aftertaste more bitter than bittersweet.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead MUSIC\n\nGeese \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Croxton, February 12 An hour and a half before buzzy New York four-piece Geese are due on stage, there\u2019s two lines of people on the footpath outside: one waiting to get in, the other sheepishly holding up signs for tickets: \u201cFriend didn\u2019t show up? I\u2019ll buy your ticket,\u201d reads one. Another: \u201cThis Goose has no tix\u201d. Frontman Cameron Winter performs with Geese at The Croxton on Thursday, February 12. Martin Philbey Gooses they were. Ever since 23-year-old frontman Cameron Winter\u2019s wonky, astonishing solo LP Heavy Metal grew from late-2024 curiosity into revered modern classic, the cult of Cameron has turbocharged Geese\u2019s trajectory. When Winter\u2019s Tuesday night solo piano show at The Forum went on sale in August 2025, it sold out instantly. In September, Geese released their third LP, the knotty Getting Killed, to rapturous reception. It means here now, on their debut Australian tour for Laneway Festival, both Winter and Geese could have played at venues three times the size, many times over. For one night only in High Street in Thornbury, it feels like being at the molten centre of the music universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShockingly, Geese live up to the hype. Augmented by keyboard player Sam Revaz, Geese demonstrate they\u2019re far more than their famous frontman\u2019s backing band, with a dissonant clinic of sizzling indie rock, laced with prog, blues, punk, folk and anything else ever made with guitars. Somehow, nothing\u2019s ornamental, no one slacks off. From the opening slow burn of Husbands, the rammed crowd yell every word of Winter\u2019s knack for self-flagellation: \u201cI\u2019m falling apart\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve been hit by the bus of life\u201d, \u201cBaby, you can change and still choose me\u201d. They blast through all of Getting Killed and a couple of songs from 3D Country (2023), including an unhinged 2122, inspiring the first circle pit of the night. Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. Martin Philbey There\u2019s a wild vibrancy to Geese live that just isn\u2019t present on the airtight audio of their records. New chordal passages emerge as guitarist Emily Green and drummer Max Bassin lead odd, telekinetic choices \u2013 where Winter was his own wry agent of chaos at Tuesday\u2019s intimate solo show, tonight he\u2019s the steely, charismatic fulcrum around which Geese expands and contracts. Cobra, Au Pays du Cocaine and Taxes are gorgeous, given a spectral heft in this quasi-religious setting, while 100 Horses and the set-closing barnstormers, Long Island City Here I Come and Trinidad put the crowd on spin cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rumours are true: Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. You\u2019re a goose if you missed it.\n\nReviewed by Marcus Teague THEATRE\n\nCluedo \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nComedy Theatre, until March 15 Every generation from the Boomers down knows Cluedo. Editions of the game have been around since 1949, and kids tend to learn what a murder mystery is by playing it \u2013 well before they\u2019re introduced to Agatha Christie. The usual suspects ham it up in Cluedo. Eddie Jim Childhood nostalgia for the franchise undergirds this commercial comedy. It adapts Jonathan Lynn\u2019s 1985 film Clue (a box office flop that developed a cult following) and a talented cast embraces the zaniness of a show that\u2019s feather-light on suspense and plot but slathered with mildly diverting drollery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix usual suspects are invited to an English country house under the assumed names of characters from the game \u2013 Professor Plum (David James), Miss Scarlett (Olivia Deeble), Mrs Peacock (Genevieve Lemon), Colonel Mustard (Adam Murphy), Mrs White (Rachael Beck) and Reverend Green (Laurence Boxhall). They\u2019re greeted by the butler Wadsworth (Grant Piro), French maid Yvette (Lib Campbell) and a dour knife-wielding Cook (Octavia Barron-Martin). When their elusive host Mr Boddy (Joshua Monaghan) appears, it\u2019s only for long enough to reveal sinister designs before adding to the body count. What follows is a chaotic hunt for the killer(s) that gets serially interrupted by yet more potential victims, and features a blend of ridiculous sight gags, exaggerated caricature, inane banter and comforting in-jokes, and tightly choreographed physical humour with strong elements of revolving-door farce. Cluedo is cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment. Eddie Jim Each actor confects moments in the spotlight. They all have fun playing with genre stereotype, though it\u2019s Piro\u2019s butler who acts as a kind of MC and gives the most versatile (and ludicrous) performance, with Boxhall\u2019s neurotic, jelly-limbed slapstick not far behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProduction values are high, the set and costume design on par with the style of murder mystery theatre \u2013 think The Mousetrap \u2013 that Cluedo merrily lampoons. Related Article Melbourne live reviews Tradition and modernity collide in this story of loneliness I\u2019d like to see a push towards more diverse casting in shows of this ilk. The play\u2019s nominal setting in 1940s England hardly calls for historical accuracy or naturalism when it\u2019s based on a game played by everyone, and the familiarity Cluedo trades on might have even broader appeal if it better reflected contemporary Australian audiences. That said, Cluedo isn\u2019t envelope-pushing stuff. Nor is it \u201ca killer night out\u201d as billboards claim. No, it\u2019s undemanding comedy \u2013 a cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

In the character of lovelorn bootlegger Gatsby squandering his wealth on debauched Long Island parties, it\u2019s hard not to think of tech billionaires foisting their unhealthy products on a bewildered populace and using the proceeds to fund narcissistic schemes while the planet burns. Shiv Palekar as Jay Gatsby and Jess Vickers as Daisy Buchanan in a new stage adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Queensland Theatre Not that this new stage adaptation, a co-production of Queensland Theatre and local independents Shake & Stir, indulges in any tricksy updating, apart from a few techno dance sequences. It\u2019s rather a faithful, fast-moving rendition that explodes with Jazz Age decadence and is fleshed out with witty dialogue courtesy of co-adaptors Daniel Evans and Nelle Lee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe human drama hits harder here than in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 2013 version, but the film\u2019s sensory overload is clearly a touchstone. Co-directors Evans and Nick Skubij offer enough sumptuous staging to equal the images that F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece conjures in the mind\u2019s eye, from orgiastic New York speakeasies to desolate dump the Valley of the Ashes. It\u2019s a showcase for designer Christina Smith, whose sets and costumes conjure the 1920s with hyper-real brilliance. Libby Munro as Jordan Baker and Ryan Hodson as Nick Carraway. Queensland Theatre Of particular note is the use of computer-controlled black screens that facilitate quick scene changes and concentrate the field of vision: at times the action seems to take place within a square silent-film ratio. The endearingly nervy Ryan Hodson (Shake & Stir\u2019s Fourteen) has the arduous task of playing Fitzgerald\u2019s narrator, Nick Carraway, and is barely off stage for over two hours. Carraway is the bonds salesman and would-be writer who moves to Long Island after serving in the war and stumbles into the love triangle between his waifish cousin, Daisy (Jess Vickers), her bigoted and abusive husband, Tom Buchanan (Jeremiah Wray), and the mysterious millionaire Gatsby (Shiv Palekar). Jeremiah Wray (Tom Buchanan) and Gatsby (Shiv Palekar) represent a clash of old and new money. Queensland Theatre\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick\u2019s PTSD is made palpable by the presence of a shadowy soldier in a doughboy helmet dogging his heels. In the title role, pink-suited Palekar gets a flamboyant entrance befitting his iconic status, but the character\u2019s flimsy aspirations are soon apparent in Palekar\u2019s aptly boyish and tentative performance. (You can read what you like into the casting of an Indian-born actor as the object of the racist villain\u2019s scorn.) As his old-money nemesis Buchanan, the towering Wray is a proto-MAGA bully, but an equally lost soul: having played the creature in Shake & Stir\u2019s Frankenstein, Wray has a way with piteous monsters. Related Article Review Brisbane Festival: These fairy tales are not for kids The production brings two of the female supporting roles to life impressively. As the pansexual lady golfer Jordan Baker, Libby Munro is the very image of a 1920s garconne, and her banter with the smitten Nick, daring him to take a \u201cbig swing\u201d, is priceless. Nelle Lee plays Buchanan\u2019s reckless mistress, Myrtle Wilson, and imbues her with Cyndi Lauper vibes. Musical theatre star Loren Hunter, meanwhile, augments Guy Webster\u2019s excellent score with powerful renditions of period songs like I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes). Evans\u2019 emerging vision for Queensland Theatre seems to be as a timely interpreter of familiar IP. (His triumphant staging of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s A Few Good Men last year sadly dovetailed with the death of the film version\u2019s director, Rob Reiner.) This makes him a kindred spirit to Brisbane independent success story Shake & Stir, adaptors of everything from Dickens to Dahl, and future collaborations seem like a done deal.

Bangkok: If you\u2019ve spent any time on the streets here in the last few years, you would have almost certainly caught the unmistakable waft of marijuana. Maybe you even indulged, and why not? It has been legal, after all. When Thailand removed cannabis from its narcotics list in 2022 \u2013 the first Asian country to do so \u2013 18,000 or so marijuana parlours popped up around the country. Cannabis was decriminalised in Thailand in 2022, leading to a boom in dispensaries. Getty The shops were everywhere, like pubs in London. And if you didn\u2019t smell them first, you couldn\u2019t miss their flashing green neon signs in the shape of a marijuana leaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea behind decriminalisation was to boost Thailand\u2019s brand as a wellness destination, give farmers a new cash crop and free up space in overcrowded prisons. Related Article Drug reform \u2018As legal as garlic\u2019: High times in Thailand as marijuana is decriminalised Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed just the trick. Tourism makes up roughly 15 per cent of Thailand\u2019s GDP. Tycoon turned pro-business politician Anutin Charnvirakul was the champion behind decriminalisation. If that name sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he has been Thailand\u2019s prime minister since September, essentially in a caretaker role. On Sunday, his Bhumjaithai Party surpassed all expectations to win the most seats in the country\u2019s snap elections, meaning he\u2019s almost certain to stay in the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the face of it, this would be a positive for the cannabis industry\u2019s long-term health, no? Well, not necessarily. A blackboard illustrating cannabis strains for sale inside a dispensary in Bangkok. Bloomberg The cannabis trade has been a debacle of the former government\u2019s own making. With few regulations in place, it boomed in 2022, becoming an out-of-control beast that ensnared previous non-users, including minors. Family holidaymakers, meanwhile, were turned off because who wants to be walking the kids through streets thick with the smell of drugs?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA local backlash followed and, midway through last year, the ruling Pheu Thai party declared that cannabis could be sold only to someone with a doctor\u2019s prescription. The burgeoning industry was decimated overnight. Shops were already struggling because there was too much low-priced cannabis, too many outlets and too few customers. Many closed. Some began looking the other way on prescriptions, spawning a black market that operates not just in plain sight, but under big glowing signs. In 2022, Thailand became the first country in Asia to decriminalise cannabis. Bloomberg Survival has meant new strategies. One shop in the Sukhumvit area, for example, redesigned its frontage to resemble a pharmacy. I ask the server, Ramil, 26, if Bhumjaithai romping home in the election (though the party still needs to cobble together a coalition) is good news for the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d he says, with an inflection of enthusiasm. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d It has been a tough game for a long time now, he says. Cannabis flooded the market in 2022, cutting profit margins. \u201cAnd then maybe it stabilised. But then with the prescriptions, that hurt.\u201d Ramil, 26, behind the counter of a Bangkok marijuana parlour, which now looks more like a pharmacy. Zach Hope The most novel approach I\u2019ve seen is at a shop called Cloud Nine, also in Sukhumvit. On the footpath outside, an A-frame sign declares \u201cfree prescription with every purchase\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe asked the friendly, English-speaking server what it\u2019s all about. (English speakers are vital because the customers are mostly foreigners, with Australians high on that list.) It\u2019s all very simple, she says, asking not to be named or photographed. The cannabis trade has been a debacle of the former government\u2019s own making. Bloomberg \u201cIf you purchase the flower, you\u2019ll be consulting with a doctor. The doctor will diagnose you, asking \u2018what do you need it for and how much do you need?\u2019.\u201d Then, hey presto, a prescription!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no in-house doctor, she says. It\u2019s a telehealth hook-up to a nearby clinic. Does the doctor ever say no? \u201cNot really,\u201d she says. There\u2019s no need to book in advance and the whole process takes just a few minutes. \u201cWe won\u2019t sell without [a] prescription. That\u2019s the golden rule here,\u201d she says. \u201cTalking to my customers, a lot of them say, \u2018Oh, why do we have to do it here? Other shops, they don\u2019t do it\u2019. But we\u2019re doing it the right way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says she has no idea whether Bhumjaithai will do away with the prescription law introduced by the previous government. It seems unlikely. Though we could not get a response from Bhumjaithai amid its post-election bargaining with other parties, Anutin has previously argued that the loosening of the laws was always focused on medicinal marijuana, rather than recreational, use. Anutin Charnvirakul speaks to media at Bhumjaithai Headquarters as results come in favouring Bhumjaithai on election night on Sunday. Getty Images No party wants to touch the law now. Surveys show the overwhelming majority of Thais don\u2019t want recreational cannabis use legalised in their country. Meanwhile, even tourism bodies, concerned at losing high-value family holidaymakers, support reclassification. Visitor numbers in Thailand remain below pre-COVID levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of Thais invested their savings to open cannabis businesses that have already closed their doors. Others cling on precariously. The Thai government\u2019s experiment with marijuana has not only been sloppy. For some people, it has been a disaster.

Got it Share A A A\n\nA plan to boost Sydney\u2019s 24-hour economy has hit a major obstacle, with the NSW government scaling back plans for around-the-clock trading at a new $100 million inner-city cultural venue after the proposal sparked a wave of community objections over late-night noise. The NSW government has walked back a contentious trading plan for The Cutaway cultural hub in Barangaroo after the site was earmarked for 24/7 operations as part of broader push by Premier Chris Minns to \u201cbring Sydney back to life\u201d. The Cutaway during construction works last year. James Brickwood When completed this year, The Cutaway will include multiple event spaces carved into the headland beneath Barangaroo Reserve, with room to host large art installations, performances, festivals, concerts, gala dinners, fashion shows and events including Vivid Sydney. But less than a year after the 24/7 operating hours were proposed, those plans have been scaled back, with most events to be capped at midnight, with limited exceptions for major occasions such as New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOriginally, Placemaking NSW, the government agency overseeing the development, argued that 24-hour operations would advance the state\u2019s vision to boost nightlife, tourism and Sydney\u2019s global standing. The venue\u2019s location next to Barangaroo Metro station was cited as a major advantage, allowing for extended trading supported by improved public transport access. A concept image of what the new venue will look like when completed. The proposal quickly drew objections from residents of high-rise towers and community groups in Barangaroo and Millers Point. Concern centred on the cumulative impacts of late-night events, particularly noise, crowd control and disruption to residential amenity. Anne Crabb, president of the Millers Point Community Resident Action Group, said the scale and design of the venue heightened those fears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnlike current 24/7 venues such as The Crown casino and The Star, this is a huge and open cavernous space located on the harbourfront,\u201d she said. \u201cBarangaroo can and should be a vibrant cultural precinct, but this must not come at the expense of our long-standing residential community who will have to deal with the late-night impacts.\u201d The venue will have a capacity for almost 3000 patrons. James Brickwood Resident Rosalind Lehane said uninterrupted sleep would be jeopardised under a 24-hour trading model. \u201cThe proposed changes to The Cutaway of 24-hour noise and vibration are incompatible with this aim,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Exclusive\n\nCity life First look inside \u2018tree\u2019 sculptures to heal Barangaroo\u2019s scar Strata representatives from neighbouring towers also raised concerns about the venue\u2019s acoustic design. Strata managing agent Kate Maclachlan warned that the semi-enclosed structure could amplify sound and create \u201creverberation\u201d impacts. In a submission to the NSW government, Robert Spears claimed noise levels could be comparable to a \u201cFormula One grand prix race\u201d. \u201cIf you wanted to devise a scheme to make our city less liveable than it already is, then you would come up with this new Cutaway proposal,\u201d he wrote. In response to what planning documents described as \u201cstrong concerns\u201d, Placemaking NSW has scaled back the operating hours to 8am to midnight. Some noise controls will be applied from 10pm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvent patrons will be directed toward Barangaroo and Wynyard Walk, rather than through residential streets in Millers Point, and integrated ticketing will be encouraged to promote use of the metro. Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolau described the decision to wind back the 24-hour operations as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, arguing the city needed more late-night venues to counter the lingering effects of the pandemic and increased working from home. The 24/7 trading plan had sparked opposition from residents in the high-rise waterfront precinct. Sam Mooy \u201cIf you choose to live in Barangaroo \u2013 in the heart of a global city \u2013 a level of noise should be expected,\u201d he said. \u201cWe desperately need to ensure there are enough venues and facilities that are open 24/7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe venue could have hosted overnight concerts, creative events or live broadcasts of international sporting competitions. At the very least we should have given it a trial.\u201d He said expanding public transport to 24-hour operations could have also supported the safe dispersal of late-night crowds. NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues had supported the original operating hours, saying extended trading would facilitate a diverse range of events and encourage tourism. In revised plans, Placemaking NSW said the midnight finishing times would provide \u201ca more clearly defined and constrained operating regime that balances the role of The Cutaway as a thriving, unique and industry-leading cultural venue with the need to protect the amenity of surrounding residential areas.\u201d Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolaou said the revised plans were disappointing. Brook Mitchell\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokeswoman said operations would begin with a three-month trial and that trading hours \u201cmay be further relaxed to support what Sydneysiders and visitors are seeking\u201d. The changes remain subject to final approval from the NSW Department of Planning. The NSW government is taking steps to enhance the nighttime economy through reforms that have included simplified noise regulations, support for outdoor events and improvements to liquor licensing. Construction of The Cutaway is more than 85 per cent complete and the first events are expected to start by July.

So it is one of those things that it is a difficult game to predict, and it\u2019ll continue to be that way, I think, as long as we play it.\u201d Toby and Zak make a pact Greater Western Sydney antagonist Toby Greene and Butters made a pre-game pact to set an aggressive tone during Saturday night\u2019s clash against Western Australia at Perth Stadium in Perth. Which should come as a surprise to no one.\n\nThe feisty Butters found himself in a scrap with WA defender Tom Barrass when the home team were making a late charge to win back the lead. \u201cI think he got Toby a bit late, and I was just backing him up,\u201d Butters explained. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the Origin spirit. The game was pretty close at that point, so I really wanted to get the win. Zak Butters and Tom Barrass get up close and personal. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe spoke about it a little bit pre-game. We\u2019re both starting half-forward, so we said, we would try and set the tone in that area. I\u2019ve looked up to him (Greene) for a while now, obviously growing up as a kid. I really admire the way he plays, so it\u2019s good to do it with him.\u201d Butters agreed that he and Greene liked to play on the edge.\n\n\u201cI think I naturally do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes down a little bit to it sometimes, but I feel like we\u2019ve all created some good relations over the weekend. It helps me get involved in the game a little bit as well.\u201d No wonder Port are so desperate to keep their heart-and-soul vice-captain.

We\u2019ve used lots of different things at times. And today, we used that Origin history.\n\nGawn said Lyon embraced the \u201cMr Origin\u201d role. \u201cHe\u2019s been good, Garry,\u201d he said. \u201cHis job was to really fire us up.

Chris Scott was so method-based, and leaving the game up to some of the star players we had. And then Garry was like, nah boys, we got to put a hip and shoulder right into these [guys] in the first contest.\n\nWe asked Gawn about his preconceived view of Scott.

Sometimes I thought he was better than the game, but when you think about it, he\u2019s actually just putting so much to his players. \u201cHe\u2019s given his players a lot of flexibility in the way they want to play. And I really gelled with it, to be honest.\u201d Gawn was mic\u2019d up for the game and was looking forward to hearing his interaction with a star-studded midfield that included Marcus Bontempelli, Nick Daicos and Butters.\n\n\u201cThe young players kept coming up and saying, \u2019it\u2019s a pleasure to play with you and Danger and Gunston and some of these guys, Bont, who have been around for a long time.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Switch is officially Nintendo\u2019s best-selling game machine of all time, second only to Sony\u2019s landmark PlayStation 2 for overall sales. And the follow-up Switch 2 is off to a good start, moving more than 17 million units in its first half-year to become the fastest-selling game system ever. But with global component shortages, rising prices and slow adoption of the Switch 2 from some major game-makers, Nintendo faces serious challenges in keeping the momentum up throughout 2026. Major big-budget releases like Resident Evil Requiem can run on Switch 2, but not all publishers are supporting the system yet. Announcing the latest sales figures recently, president Shuntaro Furukawa said the rising price of memory \u2014 driven by the AI boom \u2014 wouldn\u2019timmediately affect the Switch 2 price, which is currently $700, but an increase may happen eventually. \u201cWe do not expect major impact during the fourth quarter of this year. However, from the next fiscal year onward, if this price hike lasts longer than anticipated, it could potentially put pressure on our profitability,\u201d he said, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what does the company have planned for 2026 to keep demand high enough to counter the headwinds? Mario Tennis Fever is Nintendo\u2019s first big Switch 2 exclusive of the year. Nintendo\u2019s own offerings With 155 million Switch consoles sold, Nintendo and other game publishers are keen to continue selling games on the eight-year-old device. Indie games and less graphically intensive games in particular continue to release for the original Switch, and also work on Switch 2. But slowly and surely, players will be encouraged to upgrade to the more expensive and much more powerful new machine. Nintendo\u2019s approach with its own software is to introduce some games that are exclusively for Switch 2, and some that work on either console but are significantly better on the beefier hardware, while also issuing free and paid updates that bring new Switch 2 features to older games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, which was a huge driver of sales for Nintendo during the COVID lockdowns, received an update recently that bumps the game\u2019s graphics up to 4K, makes use of the Switch 2\u2019s mouse-style controls and microphone, and expands the multiplayer features. Next month, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Bros. Wonder will add extra characters, modes, levels and minigames. The advantage here is that the upgrade to Switch 2 gets more appealing the more original Switch games a person has, especially in the case of games like Super Mario Odyssey where the improvements are free. But it also means some games getting more expensive; if you don\u2019t already have Mario Bros. Wonder and want to buy it with the Switch 2 content included, it will cost $110. So far Nintendo has published five games exclusively for Switch 2 (pictured). But it has updated an equal number of original Switch games with exclusive new features, and launched Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 on both systems. At a recent event at Nintendo\u2019s Melbourne headquarters I was able to play early versions of some new and upcoming games. Mario Tennis Fever is exclusive to Switch 2, and it turns tennis into a party game akin to Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros, with powerful racquet effects and weird optional rules on certain courts giving players heaps to keep track of. On the other hand, Pok\u00e9mon Pokopia is clearly aiming for the broadest possible audience and is coming to both Switch and Switch 2. Co-developed by The Pok\u00e9mon Company, Game Freak and Koei Tecmo, it blends the collecting of Pok\u00e9mon and the social nature of Animal Crossing with the building recipes of Minecraft, but with the addition of some story elements to follow. Players take the role of a shape-shifting Ditto which has chosen the form of a human, and work to make a barren world habitable for a range of friendly creatures. It\u2019s surprisingly engrossing, and could turn out to be one of the year\u2019s sleeper hits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the year Nintendo is planning to release all-ages platformer Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, anime tactics RPG Fire Emblem: Fortune\u2019s Weave, and multiplayer action adventure The Duskbloods, from the developer of Dark Souls and Elden Ring From Software. The three are exclusive to Switch 2. The company often also announces new games before mid-year. The wider ecosystem As development of big-budget games has moved to more capable hardware, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, fewer have been released on the low-powered original Switch. The extra grunt of the Switch 2 could potentially correct that, but many major studios are yet to announce their blockbuster games for the portable system. Some analysts point to reports that Nintendo was unable to furnish many studios with Switch 2 hardware ahead of its launch. Major third-party games planned for, or recently released on, Switch 2 Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy VII Remake, with sequel Rebirth coming in June.\n\nUbisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s South of Midnight, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition and Oblivion Remastered, all due this year.\n\nAnticipated James Bond game 007 First Light, Sega\u2019s Yakuza Kiwami 3, and Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil Requiem will all launch on Switch 2 at the same time as other platforms in the coming months.\n\nResident Evil 7 and Village are arriving along with Requiem.\n\nEA and 2K\u2019s licensed sports games are supported on the system.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 and Street Fighter 6 were included at the system\u2019s launch.\n\nElden Ring is due to arrive this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the event I was able to preview a pair of upcoming Capcom games; Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata. These are games that would never have been able to run on the original Switch, but on Switch 2 they feel great and are visually impressive. If you had this version of Resident Evil side-by-side with a PlayStation 5 Pro running it at 4K and 60 frames per second with ray tracing, you\u2019d immediately spot that the Switch 2 isn\u2019t hitting the same resolution, performance or settings. But then a Switch 2 is almost half the price, and has the advantage of portable play. Both games looked awesome on the small handheld screen. So the issue currently isn\u2019t that the console is underpowered, but keen gamers still can\u2019t be assured the titles they\u2019re excited for on PC and consoles will come to Switch 2, purely because it would be an extra lift for studios that plan their releases years in advance. It\u2019s a catch-22, but more players may have to invest in Switch 2 before the studios consider it worth their while. The Virtual Boy is making a comeback on Switch and Switch 2. Meanwhile, Nintendo continues to expand its brand in all directions, outside new release games. A second Super Mario movie hits cinemas this year, with a live action Legend of Zelda currently filming. The Pikmin Bloom smartphone app, a take on Pok\u00e9mon GO which encourages users to explore by walking, is going strong after five years. And the company runs a subscription on Switch and Switch 2 that gives families access to classic games originally published in the \u201980s, \u201990s and 2000s. The latest console added to this collection, the Virtual Boy, is notable because it was originally a financial disaster. The heavy and headache-inducing 1995 VR headset sold less than a million units, had 22 games published for it and was pulled from shelves within a year, with Nintendo all but refusing to acknowledge it until recently. Next week, subscribers will be able to play games from the worst-selling Nintendo system ever on the best-selling, with Virtual Boy on Switch and Switch 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor's pick Exclusive\n\nVideo games 135 years of secrets: Nintendo is more than a video game company In my brief testing of the system, which requires a sold-separately viewer you slide your console into (Nintendo is selling both a $140 replica of the original headset and a $30 cardboard version), I was surprised to find the games still feel novel and interesting. They\u2019re monochrome, but the 3D visuals work. Smart filters and display options make them comfortable to look at, and it\u2019s all a reminder of what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s stayed the same in the past 30 years. If half a per cent of the Switch and Switch 2 audience get a new Virtual Boy, it will have reached more players than the original did back in the day.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s new leadership will seek to win back a reputation of party of lower taxes and better economic managers after former leader Peter Dutton nixed their tax cut proposals before the last election. Opposition Leader Angus Taylor and deputy Jane Hume said on Sunday they wanted to return their party to its roots and reprioritise boosting productivity, leaving the door open to budget cuts. Taylor said he wanted the Coalition to be the party of lower taxes. Alex Ellinghausen The pair held the shadow treasury and finance portfolios at the last election, when the Coalition under Peter Dutton opposed Labor\u2019s marginal tax cut and suggested the money be spent on defence instead. Taylor immediately conceded after ousting former leader Sussan Ley on Friday that policy had been a mistake and began pitching a directional change. \u201cAll Liberals know instinctively that the Liberal Party should always be, and must always be, a party of lower taxes because we know that when taxes are lower, Australians get a chance to get ahead,\u201d Jane Hume told ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday. \u201cWe know when taxes are lower, the economy grows without creating inflation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor identified the lack of tax cuts as a bad call in his first press conference as leader on Friday, and on Sunday said the best place to find money was through a non-inflationary, fast-growing economy. Asked about Dutton\u2019s decision to oppose Labor\u2019s tax cut, Taylor said: \u201cI proposed a way forward with lower personal income taxes, and that is already something I\u2019ve put on the record.\u201d \u201cWe need to convince Australians that we will be the party of lower taxes, and we will take a strong, strong policy package to the next election,\u201d Taylor said, speaking separately on Sky News. \u201cUnder Labor, we are seeing rising personal income taxes. I mean, they carry on about how they\u2019re bringing down personal income taxes. Well, fine, we made a mistake in the election campaign. But let me tell you, when inflation rages \u2013 and it goes up as it is under this hopeless treasurer \u2013 people pay more taxes as a proportion of their income,\u201d he said. Taylor said he had always advocated for lower taxes. Niki Savva, a columnist for this masthead, has reported Taylor and Hume had wanted to offer their own tax cut as a contrast to the surprise $5 a week tax cut Albanese revealed in the March budget last year. Dutton, according to Savva, was not interested in Taylor\u2019s plan to offer a tax-back guarantee for those forced into a higher tax bracket by inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor also denied he had worked to undermine Ley when he was on her frontbench. \u201cI sought to be a supporter of her leadership every single day,\u201d Taylor told Sky News. \u201cWe got to a point\u2026 where the view of the party room (was that) there needs to be a reset.\u201d While Taylor and Hume were on Sunday reluctant to detail policy so soon after taking control of the party, Hume said they would oppose any plan to reducing the capital gains tax discount \u2013 something neither Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have denied. This masthead revealed the government was considering a cut in the CGT concession as part of a broader tax reform package aimed at helping younger Australians to buy their own home. Jane Hume said the party was always open to lowering taxes. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat discussion has been had in the party room for some months,\u201d Hume said. \u201cWhether it be changes to negative gearing, whether it be changes to capital gains tax\u2026 Liberals know instinctively, when we talk to each other, that we are a party of lower taxes, and that if you tax something, there is less of it.\u201d Related Article Exclusive\n\nLiberal Party \u2018We were like lemmings going over a cliff\u2019: Inside Dutton\u2019s $17 billion blunder \u201cIf you tax residential housing, there will be less of it. That would be a disaster. No one has yet come out and demonstrated that a wholesale change to capital gains tax on residential housing will create more houses or provide more rental opportunities for rental houses for those that are yet to purchase their first home.\u201d Hume would not commit to any specific tax reforms but conceded \u201cmore of the same clearly isn\u2019t good enough\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not making policy on the run on Sunday morning, 48 hours after I\u2019ve become deputy leader,\u201d she said. \u201cAngus Taylor and I instinctively will always say lower taxes are better than higher taxes, and they\u2019re better for all Australians.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHume, who will get to choose her portfolio, foreshadowed an economic role. \u201cI am particularly interested in making sure I have an opportunity to talk about what\u2019s important to me, which is making sure that we have a far more productive economy,\u201d she said. Albanese attacked the new Coalition line-up on Sunday, saying his government would in July deliver the $5 a week tax cut they promised in the last election and one next year \u201cafter Angus Taylor led the charge to not only suppose but to say that he would legislate, if he hadn\u2019t been elected treasurer in the election less than a year ago, that he would legislate to actually increase taxes for all 14 million Australians\u201d.\n\n\n\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

In search of long-lasting memories, we try to pack a lot into every trip, but moving from one city to another, unpacking and repacking, can be a recipe for exhaustion. There is another way. Cruising is all about taking it slow, visiting several destinations while unpacking just once. But not all cruises are created equal. Holland America Line specialises in immersive itineraries designed for travellers who want to savour the journey rather than simply ticking places off their bucket list. This approach to relaxation also includes a variety of dining destinations, a ship size that gives you plenty of space to spread out, entertainment options stretching from live performances to family game rooms and a 1:2 crew-to-guest ratio that ensures you are always looked after. Start your voyage from the bustling waterfront of Seattle, the gateway to an immersive odyssey across the Pacific. Embrace the journey\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLonger itineraries are designed for travellers who love the idea of an old-school odyssey, traversing a region for weeks at a time. A voyage such as the 34-day Legendary South Pacific Crossing: Seattle to Sydney, is a leisurely experience and a rare opportunity to discover many of the far-flung archipelagos scattered across the Pacific Ocean.

Guests will get to visit some of Hawaii\u2019s loveliest islands, from the volcanic landscapes of the Big Island to the Jurassic Park jungles of Kauai, as well as exploring the many delights of Polynesia\u2019s island groups. Highlights include snorkelling in turquoise lagoons, and visits to vanilla plantations and black-pearl farms. The ship also calls in at the Cook Islands and Tonga before cruising along the New Zealand coast, where memorable stops include the tranquil Bay of Islands, lively Auckland with its beautiful harbour and Wellington, also known as Windy Welly, the compact capital where you can visit the Lord of the Rings film locations as well as the workshop where many of the movies\u2019 special effects were generated. Alaska invites you to slow down, with mirror-like waters and snow-capped peaks on a journey designed for deeper connection. Prefer to immerse yourself in a single destination? Few places are better suited to slow travel than Alaska. The largest state in the United States is also the wildest, and the more time you take to explore its crenellated coastline, the more you realise how spectacular it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Alaska Explorer itinerary, a 14-day round trip from Vancouver, gives you plenty of time to savour the region\u2019s forest-covered bays and islands, salmon-filled streams and glaciers that glow blue in the sun. Longer days in port allow you to connect more deeply with each location, whether you join an expert-led excursion or simply wander through local streets and markets without having to rush. Alaska\u2019s serene and icy wilderness is best captured through an immersive kayaking experience. Take a deeper dive Whether you choose to go kayaking in the turquoise Eklutna Lake, fed by molten glaciers, whitewater rafting down the Keystone Canyon or get up close to the mighty Hubbard Glacier, which regularly calves three-storey-high icebergs, it is hard not to be awed by Alaska\u2019s untamed beauty. Beyond simply getting you up close to these amazing landscapes, these journeys also give you an intimate understanding of the destination. The Alaska Up Close program includes expert talks on everything from native cultures to the pioneer women who battled endless difficulties, while the Junior Rangers program is a fun way for kids to learn about the ecosystem, wildlife and culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreathtaking wildlife views like that of a breaching humpback, prove that Alaska\u2019s grand scale and vivid sights elevate your slow travel journey. And because some of the best sightseeing is done from the water, expect to find several sea days on your itinerary. These will be among the most thrilling days of the trip, with National Park Service rangers and wildlife experts out on deck to help you spot bald eagles, sea otters, harbor seals, humpback whales and perhaps orcas. Alaska\u2019s unique flavours are as unforgettable as its sights and sounds. Get ready to sink your teeth into local specialties from snow crab to wild berries, smoked seafood chowder to fresh-caught salmon. As the first and only cruise line to have every ship certified sustainable by Certified Seafood International, you can tuck in with a clean conscience. And if you feel like throwing a line in yourself, the Savour My Catch program offers the ultimate culinary thrill: the chance to reel in a fish and have it prepared for you for dinner that night.

Her kimchi differs from many commercially available versions in Australia, with a lighter, cleaner flavour and less reliance on fish sauce. The style reflects family recipes passed down through generations.\n\n\"My parents came to South Korea from the North after the Korean War,\" she said.\n\n\"I grew up watching my grandmother and mother make kimchi, and those North Korean family recipes stayed with me.\"\n\nWhat is kimchi?\n\nKimchi is a fermented dish typically made from vegetables such as napa cabbage, radish, spring onion and cucumber, seasoned with chilli, garlic, ginger and salt.\n\nAccording to Korea's food and drug safety ministry, there are more than 2,000 varieties of kimchi.\n\nLISTEN TO Kimchi: A Story of Love and Memory SBS Korean 07:22 Korean\n\nIt's a cornerstone of Korean cuisine \u2014 more than just a side dish, but a soul food served with almost every meal, from simple home-cooked dinners to Korean barbecue and special celebrations.\n\nIn an era when kimchi is easily bought, making it by hand remains something special for many Koreans \u2014 a way of staying connected to culture, family and tradition.\n\nKimchi, a new taste for Tasmanians\n\nWhen Glynn first sold kimchi at Tasmanian markets, many locals were unfamiliar with it, and she often had to offer tastings to introduce people to the flavour.\n\nOver time, as global interest in Korean culture grew through films, television dramas and K-pop, kimchi became more widely recognised.\n\nGlynn said it has been particularly well received by people interested in health and wellbeing, drawn to its fermented nature and probiotic benefits.\n\n\"People in their 30s through to their 70s show strong interest,\" she said.\n\n\"Especially those who want to improve their gut health. It's not limited to one age group.\"\n\nHer produce and kimchi have been assessed by several Australian food awards programs, including the Royal Tasmanian Fine Food Awards, Royal Hobart, Melbourne Royal, and Australian Food Awards, where they received multiple acknowledgements for quality.\n\nIn 2022, Glynn was also named a finalist in the Australian Organic Industry Awards' farmer of the year category.\n\nGlynn grows up to 5,000 napa cabbages a year, and supplies them to local markets Source: SBS News / Leah Hyein Na\n\nTwo years ago, Glynn relocated to Evandale, around 10 minutes from Launceston airport.\n\nWhile she scaled back farming production, she shifted her focus toward people \u2014 creating more opportunities to connect, share and exchange culture through hands-on kimchi workshops.\n\nAt one workshop, local resident Clare tried kimchi for the first time. \"It's amazing \u2014 tasty, fresh, and beautifully balanced,\" she said.\n\n\"It's something completely different from anything I've had before. I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nAnother participant, Di, said the experience made fermentation feel accessible.\n\n\"I loved using natural ingredients and knowing exactly what goes into it,\" she said.\n\n\"The hands-on process was so much fun, and it was great doing it together. It makes you want to experiment more.\"\n\nA very Australian replacement\n\nThe most surprising element of the workshop was Glynn's Weet-Bix kimchi.\n\n\"When making kimchi, Koreans usually add starch, such as glutinous rice or wheat starch, to feed the microorganisms and support fermentation,\" Glynn explained.\n\n\"One morning after breakfast, I thought \u2014 Weet-Bix is also made from grain. Why not?\"\n\nBy blending Weet-Bix with garlic and ginger, then mixing it with Korean chilli powder, coconut soy sauce and white peach paste, she creates a rich wet mix that coats the salt-pickled cabbage and supports fermentation \u2014 without the need to cook a separate starch.\n\nGlynn uses Weet-Bix for the vital ingredient of starch. Source: SBS News / Leah Hyein Na\n\n\"Using Weet-Bix makes the process much simpler,\" she said.\n\n\"It stabilises fermentation and helps develop flavour beautifully.\"\n\nWorkshop participant Carol was intrigued by the idea.\n\n\"Using something as simple as Weet-Bix \u2014 something everyone has in their pantry \u2014 as a fermentation base is fascinating,\" she said.\n\n\"It makes fermentation feel uncomplicated and approachable.\"\n\nTassie's future for fermentation\n\nGlynn believes Tasmania's cooler climate \u2014 similar to Korea's winters \u2014 makes it particularly suitable for fermented foods like kimchi. She notes that this aligns with the Tasmanian government's broader push to increase value-adding in agriculture and food production through fermentation.\n\nThrough collaboration with local councils, the Tasmanian government has invested $1.7 million in a 1,800-square-metre fermentation hub near Launceston, designed to support small-scale fermenters. Glynn has also participated in the project.\n\nTasmania's population stands at around 570,000, with 15.3 per cent born overseas, according to the latest Census. By comparison, more than 40 per cent of Sydney's population was born overseas.\n\nDespite its smaller migrant population, Glynn believes regional areas like Tasmania offer genuine opportunities for migrants.\n\n\"Many migrants live within bubbles in big cities like Sydney and Melbourne,\" she said.\n\n\"But if you look at Australia more broadly, there are real opportunities in regional areas.\"\n\nShe points to demand in agriculture, dairy farming, beef farming and skilled trades, where labour shortages persist.\n\nGlynn holds kimchi making workshops to share and exchange culture.\n\n\"Cities may have more jobs, but competition is fierce,\" she said.\n\n\"Here, if you have skills, a strong work ethic and a positive mindset, it's much easier to build something sustainable.\"\n\nIn Evandale, Glynn's kimchi has already found a home. Richard, a local shop owner who stocks her products, said her presence has brought new energy to the town.\n\n\"Having Sue living here, and potentially running more workshops in the future, could really shape the town,\" he said.\n\n\"Who knows \u2014 Evandale could one day become the kimchi capital of Tasmania.\"\n\nIn Glynn's hands, kimchi becomes more than food \u2014 showing how migrant traditions can impact Australians all over the country.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Korean.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

In WA, the government has designated both the Saturday and the Monday as public holidays.\n\nUnlike New Year's Day, Christmas Day and Boxing Day, previously there were no additional public holidays declared in NSW when Anzac Day fell on a weekend.\n\nREAD MORE Minns to consider creating public holiday fix for 'underserved' state\n\nAdding a public holiday in these circumstances won't diminish the tradition, Minns insisted.\n\n\"If anything, it is a reminder of its importance and another reason for people to get up, attend a local service and ensure the spirit of remembrance continues to be passed on to the next generation,\" he said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nRestaurants and cafes encouraged not to open\n\nThe NSW Returned and Services League (RSL) said it did not oppose the introduction of an additional public holiday after consulting with members.\n\n\"I've already had feedback from some smaller RSL organisations that ... it may give them an opportunity to get together on the Monday,\" its acting president Vince Williams said.\n\n\"Additionally, a public holiday on Monday will also provide many serving Australian Defence Force personnel who are required to work on Anzac Day itself with an opportunity to spend quality time with their loved ones.\"\n\nBut the decision hasn't garnered universal backing, with Minns acknowledging not all business groups were on board.\n\n\"We know that it's somewhat of an additional burden for small businesses in particular,\" he said.\n\n\"But this is, we believe, an important thing to do for the state.\"\n\nThe decision will lift labour costs for hospitality venues to 75 and 100 per cent of sales, Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association chief executive Wes Lambert warned.\n\n\"So we'll be encouraging cafes and restaurants not to open,\" he told ABC TV.\n\n\"It won't just be a public holiday for office workers, it'll be a public holiday for everyone.\n\n\"Hospitality businesses are on some of the lowest profit margins in history, below three per cent, and they just cannot wear another public holiday in NSW.\"\n\nMajor lobby group Business NSW declined to comment on the decision.\n\nFewer public holidays in NSW\n\nNSW has fewer public holidays than all other mainland states and territories.\n\nAnzac Day is one of 10 public holidays recognised nationwide in 2026.\n\nMost Australians get another three or four, including those in Victoria, Queensland, ACT and South Australia.\n\nBut NSW enjoys just two extra: the King's Birthday in June and Labour Day in October.\n\nChristmas Island celebrates an extra six, including two for Lunar New Year in February.\n\nThe Minns government will consider making the Anzac Day change permanent and decide if the number of statewide public holidays is enough.\n\nIt will look at economic and social impacts of the extra public holiday in 2026 and 2027 and be subject to feedback from community, business and veteran groups.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "As Lunar New Year approaches, many Asian Australian families are planning an annual gathering to celebrate the festival \u2014 but not everyone feels happy about it.\n\nThe two-week cultural festival is often considered a time for family reunions, connections and new beginnings, but increased family time can also create pressure and reopen old wounds, according to Maria Cassaniti, manager of the NSW government's Transcultural Mental Health Centre in western Sydney.\n\n\"Lunar New Year, similar to other events for different communities \u2026 is a time of excitement and celebration for many, but we also know that these kinds of events \u2026 can come with [their] own stress,\" she tells SBS News.\n\nWhile some multicultural communities may still grapple with stigma about mental health, Cassaniti says many have become more aware of its importance in recent years, including during cultural events such as Lunar New Year.\n\nREAD MORE How to navigate family estrangement over Christmas\n\nSBS News has spoken with several psychologists and mental health experts ahead of the festival, which starts on 17 February, about how to look after your mental health during the Lunar New Year. Here are their tips.\n\nFrom dinner table arguments to inappropriate comments\n\nIn China and Vietnam, where people can enjoy a week-long holiday for Lunar New Year, local media have reported on youth disengagement with the traditional festival, citing stress from dealing with family expectations.\n\nIn Australia, young people from the Asian diaspora may also find themselves in similar shoes, as their values may differ from those held by older generations who grew up in Asia, says Christopher Tran, a Sydney-based psychologist dedicated to multicultural mental health.\n\nSydney-based psychologist Christopher Tran says generational disputes are common in many Asian Australian families. Source: Supplied / Christopher Tran\n\n\"There's a bunch of things in Asian cultures that don't necessarily make things difficult, but it's interesting when it interacts with the culture we have here [in Australia],\" he tells SBS News.\n\nTran says many of his clients have found it difficult to deal with \"personal questions\" and comments from family members \u2014 on subjects ranging from marriage to career progression \u2014 as well as managing family expectations.\n\nTip: Be prepared, and set a boundary for engagement\n\nIf you feel stressed about interacting with other family members, Cassaniti suggests it could be helpful to prepare for questions from senior relatives.\n\nVeronica Ing, a Sydney-based psychologist, also suggests people practise self-soothing exercises to ensure a calm state of mind and increase tolerance for potentially uncomfortable conversations before family dinners.\n\n\"Coming in with a higher tolerance means that you're more likely able to deal with any emotional triggers while you're in the presence of your family,\" she says.\n\nTran suggests setting a time limit for engagement and considering booking a follow-up event to give yourself an excuse to leave on time.\n\n\"The general thing is just remembering that: 'my parents or my uncles and aunties, they carry their own values, their own anxieties, I carry my stuff. I'm allowed to choose how much I let in of this,'\" he says.\n\nLISTEN TO Learning to understand your 'tiger' parents SBS Chinese 32:56 English\n\n\"And basically it's just about every time they try to shine that spotlight on you, just click it away.\"\n\nCassaniti, Ing and Tran say it's also important to keep in mind that people can choose whom they do and don't want to spend the Lunar New Year with.\n\nLoneliness and homesickness\n\nWhile some Asian Australians face stress from family estrangement, some international students and first-generation migrants living away from their loved ones might feel homesick and lonely during the festive period.\n\nLoneliness has been described as \"the silent epidemic\" by the Australian Psychological Society. University of Sydney research from 2025 found 43 per cent of Australians aged 15 to 25 feel lonely.\n\nDr Eric Fu, senior research fellow at the Youth Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, says many young people start university expecting a rich social life, only to find themselves isolated by their living arrangements, which can foster \"a heightened sense of loneliness\".\n\nHe's noticed loneliness has become a \"big issue\" among Chinese international students in particular, as many struggle to integrate and connect with local communities due to cultural and linguistic barriers.\n\n\"Because they are only here for a short period of time, and also they didn't really get the chance to really set their roots into the local community,\" he says.\n\nTip: Use social media well, and go for a walk\n\nFu, who has conducted research about the well-being of Chinese international students in Australia, found many turn to social media to seek interest groups and build connections with peers.\n\nHe says students also use social media to stay connected with families, friends and even strangers with similar cultural backgrounds.\n\n\"Sometimes even some unknown people clicked a like or collected their notes on Xiaohongshu or WeChat [Chinese social media apps], even that kind of recognition or identification can really play a role for them to really feel less lonely in Australia.\"\n\nBut while agreeing that social media can be a useful engagement tool for students, Fu also warns them to be cautious about online scams, especially if they have recently arrived in Australia.\n\nMore importantly, he encourages international students to \"leave their accommodation and just go out for a walk\" to explore their neighbourhoods and local communities.\n\n\"I think that will be a good way, you know, to really overcome that kind of sense of acute loneliness, you know, especially during this kind of traditional Chinese [festival] period.\"\n\nTran and Ing also point out that the Lunar New Year could be a good opportunity to build connections, as councils and local libraries often host community events.\n\nREAD MORE 2026 Lunar New Year: Celebrations Across Australia You Need to Know\n\nBesides staying connected with people in Australia, Ing and Cassaniti also encourage people to use video calls and online chats to stay connected with families living overseas as a way to counter loneliness.\n\n\"[Don't] be afraid to reach out and practice being vulnerable when you're initiating contact,\" Ing says, adding that in some Asian cultures, people may not be used to directly expressing their love and vulnerability.\n\nGambling\n\nHuangyuan Chen, a counsellor at the GambleAware Multicultural Service, tells SBS News that some members of Asian communities participate in gambling \u2014 such as playing mahjong with money \u2014 as a means of social connection during festive seasons.\n\nMajor casinos in Australia have also invested in Lunar New Year celebrations to try to attract overseas visitors.\n\nChen says it's key that people maintain control of their behaviours and take strategies to prevent themselves from engaging in problematic gambling.\n\nThis could include talking to casino staff to impose a ban on themselves from entering the venues, blocking gambling websites and talking to a gambling counsellor, Chen says.\n\nShe says people also need to be mindful of their motivations for gambling and the potential effect on others.\n\n\"Think about the people around you, because we know that people can be socially influenced [by] gambling,\" she says.\n\n\"Keep a distance from people influencing you to gamble, or keep away from the social influence, the online influence, and at the same time, spend more time with people with other interests, away from gambling, if possible.\"\n\nConsider taking leave\n\nExcept for Christmas Island, Lunar New Year isn't a public holiday in Australia. But with upcoming gatherings and other cultural practices, maintaining work-life balance can be challenging for those who celebrate amid competing priorities.\n\nTran suggests people start with the practical steps, such as speaking to their manager.\n\n\"That could feel scary, and we don't know exactly if that's going to be successful,\" he says.\"But it's worth a try, because there are some workplaces that will actually respect this [cultural festival].\"\n\nHe says people should weigh up their priorities and focus on what they think is most important.\n\n\"If you're leaning on work, then speak to your family and see if you can rearrange things; if you know family is more important, then you might just bite the bullet and just take some leave.\"\n\nPost-Lunar New Year care\n\nIf people find family gatherings during the Lunar New Year stressful, it may be worth considering seeking professional help in the future to unpack the source of pressure, Tran says.\n\nIn recent years, there have been practitioner-led initiatives and government-supported multicultural programs that encourage people with multicultural backgrounds to seek culturally inclusive mental health care, with interpreting services available.\n\nBut in the case of international students, previous research by Dr Michelle Peterie from the Sydney Centre for Healthy Societies at the University of Sydney shows that international students are less likely to access psychological support services than domestic students, as they may not know about services or worry about the costs.\n\n\"There is a real need for government-led, sector-wide action to both address some of the challenges international students face in Australia, and ensure appropriate help is available and accessible when required,\" she says.\n\nReaders seeking crisis support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged up to 25).\n\nReaders seeking support with mental health can contact Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636.

There was education in schools, special education for banks and shops, and it was really successful.\"\n\nEmily Martin is the CEO of the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra \u2013 where the coins are made.\n\nShe says it wasn\u2019t just a move that aligned us with much of the world, but also helped simplify trade and everyday transactions.\n\n\"There was a lot of calculations that people had to make to understand how many shillings were in a pound and pence in a shilling, and it was a very complex system.\"\n\nShe also says it\u2019s an opportunity to help tell the nation\u2019s story through metal.\n\nAnd six decades on, the Royal Australian Mint continues to preserve that history.\n\n\"We educate visitors, international tourists, school groups, this wonderful place that people can come and learn about our currency and the stories that we tell through our coins.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also home to the National Coin Collection \u2013 which contains more than 15-thousand items \u2013 from early colonial currency and rare proof coins, to the very designs that marked Decimal Day.\n\nThose were the brainchild of artist and metalworker Stuart Devlin \u2013 who went on to become Queen Elizabeth the Second\u2019s jeweller.\n\nMr Devlin had won a competition in 1964 \u2013 beating five other competitors \u2013 to develop the artworks for the new coins\u2026. Which introduced a distinctly Australian look.\n\nThe now-defunct one and two cent pieces featured a feathertail glider and frill-necked lizard.\n\nEven the 12-sided 50 cent coin made a statement. Originally it was round, and made from silver in 1966 \u2013 before changing shape, to prevent confusion with the 20 cent piece.\n\nIt carries Australia\u2019s coat of arms.\n\nThe Royal Australian Mint's Director Museum and Public Engagement Stuart Baines says the National Coin Collection also holds coins from over 100 countries.\n\n\"It's not just Australian coins and it's not just post decimal, the coins we have made. One of our prized pieces is the holey dollar, which was made from the Spanish. These coins were our first official currency and they really were a symbol that we wanted to grow as a nation. We didn't have a mint in this country at the time, so we of course employed a convict who had served his time in Australia for forgery and he actually was the one who struck our first coins. So there's lots of little stories that these coins can tell us about who we are and where we've come from and how we grow and change as a nation.\"\n\nThat includes stories about all segments of Australian society.\n\nWhich Mr Baines says the Mint has been committed to telling through special release coins in the decades since decimal currency was introduced.\n\n\"We do have a lot of different coins that celebrate all aspects of our life. We create coins around Paralympics and that celebrate different migrating groups to Australia and different cultures within Australia.\"\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a sharp decline in the use of cash and coins over the years, Emily Martin says commemorative and collectible series are popular as ever.\n\nAnd says the future of coins remains bright.\n\n\"There has been a decline in the use of circulating coins but we have seen that desire for our collectible coins really grow and the average new generations of collectors so it is a way that people like to recognise special events and tell our history through our coins. We will continue to make coins as long as there is demand.\"",

    "text": "Josie Baff has been left wiping away tears of joy after doubling Australia's gold medal haul by storming to victory in the women's snowboard cross event at Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nThe 23-year-old cried and jumped in delight on the podium after becoming the first Australian woman to medal in the event, with her triumph coming less than 24 hours after the shock win by Cooper Woods in the moguls.\n\nIt's the first time since 2010 in Vancouver that Australia have celebrated two golds in a Winter Games.\n\nBaff said she was inspired by Woods' triumph, with the pair having been former classmates in Jindabyne over the winter term and also crossing paths in junior surf lifesaving.\n\nBaff's boyfriend, Canadian Eliot Grondin, had also won silver in the men's snowboard cross a day earlier.\n\n\"I actually grew up doing surf lifesaving and Cooper was doing that as well so I saw him a lot down in Pambula and I know him and his family super well,\" Baff said.\n\n\"Seeing that yesterday definitely sparked a little fire in me and I thought if he can do it I can do it too.\"\n\n'I put in a lot of hard work'\n\nBaff was daring in both her semi-final and the four-racer medal race at Livigno Snow Park, as she slipped through on the inside with immaculate overtaking manoeuvres to win both races.\n\nBaff, the world championship runner-up in 2023, also revealed she had suffered from the flu earlier in the week.\n\nShe pipped both the racer who beat her for gold three years ago, Czech star Eva Adamczykova, and reigning world champ and 2018 Olympic gold medallist, Italian Michela Moioli, in a thrilling final.\n\nBaff was overcome with emotion after her victory. Source: AAP / Sergio Bisi/IPA Sport\n\nBaff said she felt she earned the win through her hard work since her Beijing disappointment, when she was left in tears after her campaign ended in the opening race.\n\n\"It's very amazing \u2014 I would like to say that I can't believe it but I kind of can,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like I deserve it and I put in a lot of hard work so I knew I could do it but to actually have the medal around my neck is very, very cool.\n\n\"It's definitely something that I've been working towards for a very long time and my team has been helping me achieve that every step of the way.\"\n\nAustralia's second snowboard cross medal \u2014 ever\n\nIt was Australia's second ever snowboard cross medal. Jarryd Hughes took silver in the men's race in Pyeongchang in 2018, while Torah Bright is the only other woman to medal in snowboarding, winning two in the halfpipe.\n\nBaff's father Peter coached both Bright and his daughter as a junior.\n\nBaff had arrived in strong form, sitting in the world No. 2 ranking, but she had a slow start to the day and finished only 17th in the seedings.\n\nThat meant she raced against new mum Adamczykova, the top seed, all the way through.\n\nBaff was the second Australian ever to win a medal in the snowboard cross. Source: AAP / Zabulon Laurent/ABACA/PA\n\n\"I was definitely disappointed as I knew I was super fast on this track and it was annoying because I wanted to win the time trial but to win the gold medal is even better so I'm super happy,\" said Baff.\n\n\"When I saw I had Eva in a first round it's definitely a tough first heat ... but I knew that it could also wake me up and work in my favour.\n\n\"It meant that we were racing from the first round and we were able to lock into that mindset really early on.\n\nBaff showed her class to win her first race and move through to the quarter-finals, where she finished second in a four-race field in a heart-stopping photo finish.\n\nShe charged through her semi-final, making a move midway through the final with a superb overtake to nab the gold by 0.04 seconds.\n\nAussie star misses out on gold\n\nHours later, Australian snowboard great Scotty James fell short in his quest to complete his Olympic medal collection.\n\nCompeting at his fifth Olympics, James became Australia's most decorated winter athlete with three medals, winning another silver after Beijing as well as the bronze he won eight years ago in Pyeongchang.\n\nHe was also part of the country's most successful single day, his second place coming shortly after Baff's gold.\n\nBut it was mostly disappointment with James shedding tears and being comforted by Australia's canoe great Jessica Fox when she presented his medal.\n\nLeading into the Olympics he had openly declared gold was his \"north star\".\n\n\"It's a bit numb, like I don't really know how to feel,\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"The next 24 hours I'll probably have a bit of a cry, but I'll be happy as well because representing the country and winning a medal is unbelievable, and I'm really proud of that.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nDumpling-making is in full swing at a restaurant near Melbourne\u2019s Chinatown.\n\nThe special Lunar New Year event has drawn 30 foodies from a range of backgrounds, including Gavin Rajahmoney.\n\n\"My family is originally from Sri Lanka and we've migrated to Australia. I'm born here in Australia. I've never made dumplings before. So, I currently study Chinese at school and my Chinese teacher actually invited me to this event. So, when I heard, I was really excited and I decided to join.\"\n\nHand-rolling dumplings is an age-old skill in Asia, dating back thousands of years to the Han dynasty in China.\n\nThe pockets of pastry symbolising wealth traditionally made with savoury meat or vegetable fillings.\n\nCustomer Paul Hordijenko explains.\n\n\"Normally we start off with the dumpling skin. Then we roll it out and then get some of the filling like this in here. And then make sure that it is squeezed nice and tight, like a seal.\"\n\nHowever, Hoppy Dumpling restaurant owner Gary Zhao, who grew up in China\u2019s Guangdong Province, says the workshop goes way beyond traditional fillings.\n\n\"We have five options. The first one is the cheese, chicken corn and the second one is the celery pork. Third one is the Korean style kimchi spicy pork. And the fourth one is the French style chicken liver. And the last one is the curried beef, curry Wagyu beef.\"\n\nWhile new flavours are well received many still prefer traditional styles \u2013 with pork and celery crowned most popular.\n\nGARY: \"I'm a really big pork fan, so that's definitely my favourite flavour.\"\n\nHENRY: \"The pork dumpling, it\u2019s been one of my favourites for a long time.\"\n\nThe choice of filling may be personal taste, there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees on, says customer Paul Hordijenko.\n\n\"The one that you buy in a supermarket, it's just quick and convenient, pretty standard taste. But I think the ones that you make by hand, they taste a lot fresher.\"\n\nMr Zhao says this was the first make-your-own dumpling event but definitely won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\"This shocked me, that many people from different culture, they all came and they all interesting about this. Many customers, they learn very fast and then really enjoy making these dumplings.\"\n\nRolling these tasty parcels is also a chance to learn about the history of Lunar New Year celebrations, says Paul Hordijenko.\n\n\"I actually heard it for the first time today that they'll put normally a coin inside the filling for good luck for Chinese New Year, for prosperity.\"\n\nAnd it seems to be working.\n\nOwner Gary Zhao says sales have soared since his first DIY dumpling event.\n\n\"The dumpling making event is good for the business. Before, we sold 1,000 dumplings a day. After this event, it reaches around 2,500 a day.\"\n\nFor many customers, sharing the dumplings is also a way to bring the family closer.\n\nLINISHA: \"This activity is really nice for family bonding when you're all making together traditional dumplings.\"\n\nPAUL: \"We're all busy with work and it's activity that you can do together and enjoy time as a family. So I think it's great.\"\n\nOwner Gary Zhao can only agree.\n\n\"Eating and making dumplings in China always meaning family and friends gathering together.\"",

From Fred Schepisi\u2019s 1987 romcom, Roxanne (starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah), to Virginia Gay\u2019s cross-gendered queer Cyrano at the MTC in 2022, the story has a performance history as long as its hero\u2019s nose. Mark Yeates (Cyrano) and Callum O\u2019Malley (Christian) in a scene from Cyrano De Bergerac at fortyfivedownstairs. Matthew Chen This free adaptation from playwright Martin Crimp was staged on the West End and Broadway a few years back, with James McAvoy in the title role, and now comes to Melbourne in a bold indie production with a cast much larger than any of our main stages could afford to muster. Those who felt that Gay\u2019s version for the MTC shortchanged Rostand\u2019s poetry may take heart at the obsessive centrality it assumes in Crimp\u2019s \u2013 the retention of rhyming couplets; the vision of Cyrano as spoken-word maestro, bounding across the stage versifying, mic in hand; even a poem composed (after Emily Dickinson\u2019s Because I could not stop for Death) on the field of battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who enjoyed the playfulness of a woman as Cyrano, on the other hand, and the undemanding romcom vibe Gay brought to the stage will be struck by the contrast here. The production has playful moments, but they\u2019re locked within an epic dismantling of traditional masculine ideals. Mark Yeates leads a bare-chested, knife-wielding, testosterone-drenched deconstruction that hacks away at the very notion of the heroic and leaves an aftertaste more bitter than bittersweet.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead MUSIC\n\nGeese \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Croxton, February 12 An hour and a half before buzzy New York four-piece Geese are due on stage, there\u2019s two lines of people on the footpath outside: one waiting to get in, the other sheepishly holding up signs for tickets: \u201cFriend didn\u2019t show up? I\u2019ll buy your ticket,\u201d reads one. Another: \u201cThis Goose has no tix\u201d. Frontman Cameron Winter performs with Geese at The Croxton on Thursday, February 12. Martin Philbey Gooses they were. Ever since 23-year-old frontman Cameron Winter\u2019s wonky, astonishing solo LP Heavy Metal grew from late-2024 curiosity into revered modern classic, the cult of Cameron has turbocharged Geese\u2019s trajectory. When Winter\u2019s Tuesday night solo piano show at The Forum went on sale in August 2025, it sold out instantly. In September, Geese released their third LP, the knotty Getting Killed, to rapturous reception. It means here now, on their debut Australian tour for Laneway Festival, both Winter and Geese could have played at venues three times the size, many times over. For one night only in High Street in Thornbury, it feels like being at the molten centre of the music universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShockingly, Geese live up to the hype. Augmented by keyboard player Sam Revaz, Geese demonstrate they\u2019re far more than their famous frontman\u2019s backing band, with a dissonant clinic of sizzling indie rock, laced with prog, blues, punk, folk and anything else ever made with guitars. Somehow, nothing\u2019s ornamental, no one slacks off. From the opening slow burn of Husbands, the rammed crowd yell every word of Winter\u2019s knack for self-flagellation: \u201cI\u2019m falling apart\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve been hit by the bus of life\u201d, \u201cBaby, you can change and still choose me\u201d. They blast through all of Getting Killed and a couple of songs from 3D Country (2023), including an unhinged 2122, inspiring the first circle pit of the night. Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. Martin Philbey There\u2019s a wild vibrancy to Geese live that just isn\u2019t present on the airtight audio of their records. New chordal passages emerge as guitarist Emily Green and drummer Max Bassin lead odd, telekinetic choices \u2013 where Winter was his own wry agent of chaos at Tuesday\u2019s intimate solo show, tonight he\u2019s the steely, charismatic fulcrum around which Geese expands and contracts. Cobra, Au Pays du Cocaine and Taxes are gorgeous, given a spectral heft in this quasi-religious setting, while 100 Horses and the set-closing barnstormers, Long Island City Here I Come and Trinidad put the crowd on spin cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rumours are true: Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. You\u2019re a goose if you missed it.\n\nReviewed by Marcus Teague THEATRE\n\nCluedo \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nComedy Theatre, until March 15 Every generation from the Boomers down knows Cluedo. Editions of the game have been around since 1949, and kids tend to learn what a murder mystery is by playing it \u2013 well before they\u2019re introduced to Agatha Christie. The usual suspects ham it up in Cluedo. Eddie Jim Childhood nostalgia for the franchise undergirds this commercial comedy. It adapts Jonathan Lynn\u2019s 1985 film Clue (a box office flop that developed a cult following) and a talented cast embraces the zaniness of a show that\u2019s feather-light on suspense and plot but slathered with mildly diverting drollery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix usual suspects are invited to an English country house under the assumed names of characters from the game \u2013 Professor Plum (David James), Miss Scarlett (Olivia Deeble), Mrs Peacock (Genevieve Lemon), Colonel Mustard (Adam Murphy), Mrs White (Rachael Beck) and Reverend Green (Laurence Boxhall). They\u2019re greeted by the butler Wadsworth (Grant Piro), French maid Yvette (Lib Campbell) and a dour knife-wielding Cook (Octavia Barron-Martin). When their elusive host Mr Boddy (Joshua Monaghan) appears, it\u2019s only for long enough to reveal sinister designs before adding to the body count. What follows is a chaotic hunt for the killer(s) that gets serially interrupted by yet more potential victims, and features a blend of ridiculous sight gags, exaggerated caricature, inane banter and comforting in-jokes, and tightly choreographed physical humour with strong elements of revolving-door farce. Cluedo is cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment. Eddie Jim Each actor confects moments in the spotlight. They all have fun playing with genre stereotype, though it\u2019s Piro\u2019s butler who acts as a kind of MC and gives the most versatile (and ludicrous) performance, with Boxhall\u2019s neurotic, jelly-limbed slapstick not far behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProduction values are high, the set and costume design on par with the style of murder mystery theatre \u2013 think The Mousetrap \u2013 that Cluedo merrily lampoons. Related Article Melbourne live reviews Tradition and modernity collide in this story of loneliness I\u2019d like to see a push towards more diverse casting in shows of this ilk. The play\u2019s nominal setting in 1940s England hardly calls for historical accuracy or naturalism when it\u2019s based on a game played by everyone, and the familiarity Cluedo trades on might have even broader appeal if it better reflected contemporary Australian audiences. That said, Cluedo isn\u2019t envelope-pushing stuff. Nor is it \u201ca killer night out\u201d as billboards claim. No, it\u2019s undemanding comedy \u2013 a cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

In the character of lovelorn bootlegger Gatsby squandering his wealth on debauched Long Island parties, it\u2019s hard not to think of tech billionaires foisting their unhealthy products on a bewildered populace and using the proceeds to fund narcissistic schemes while the planet burns. Shiv Palekar as Jay Gatsby and Jess Vickers as Daisy Buchanan in a new stage adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Queensland Theatre Not that this new stage adaptation, a co-production of Queensland Theatre and local independents Shake & Stir, indulges in any tricksy updating, apart from a few techno dance sequences. It\u2019s rather a faithful, fast-moving rendition that explodes with Jazz Age decadence and is fleshed out with witty dialogue courtesy of co-adaptors Daniel Evans and Nelle Lee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe human drama hits harder here than in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 2013 version, but the film\u2019s sensory overload is clearly a touchstone. Co-directors Evans and Nick Skubij offer enough sumptuous staging to equal the images that F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece conjures in the mind\u2019s eye, from orgiastic New York speakeasies to desolate dump the Valley of the Ashes. It\u2019s a showcase for designer Christina Smith, whose sets and costumes conjure the 1920s with hyper-real brilliance. Libby Munro as Jordan Baker and Ryan Hodson as Nick Carraway. Queensland Theatre Of particular note is the use of computer-controlled black screens that facilitate quick scene changes and concentrate the field of vision: at times the action seems to take place within a square silent-film ratio. The endearingly nervy Ryan Hodson (Shake & Stir\u2019s Fourteen) has the arduous task of playing Fitzgerald\u2019s narrator, Nick Carraway, and is barely off stage for over two hours. Carraway is the bonds salesman and would-be writer who moves to Long Island after serving in the war and stumbles into the love triangle between his waifish cousin, Daisy (Jess Vickers), her bigoted and abusive husband, Tom Buchanan (Jeremiah Wray), and the mysterious millionaire Gatsby (Shiv Palekar). Jeremiah Wray (Tom Buchanan) and Gatsby (Shiv Palekar) represent a clash of old and new money. Queensland Theatre\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick\u2019s PTSD is made palpable by the presence of a shadowy soldier in a doughboy helmet dogging his heels. In the title role, pink-suited Palekar gets a flamboyant entrance befitting his iconic status, but the character\u2019s flimsy aspirations are soon apparent in Palekar\u2019s aptly boyish and tentative performance. (You can read what you like into the casting of an Indian-born actor as the object of the racist villain\u2019s scorn.) As his old-money nemesis Buchanan, the towering Wray is a proto-MAGA bully, but an equally lost soul: having played the creature in Shake & Stir\u2019s Frankenstein, Wray has a way with piteous monsters. Related Article Review Brisbane Festival: These fairy tales are not for kids The production brings two of the female supporting roles to life impressively. As the pansexual lady golfer Jordan Baker, Libby Munro is the very image of a 1920s garconne, and her banter with the smitten Nick, daring him to take a \u201cbig swing\u201d, is priceless. Nelle Lee plays Buchanan\u2019s reckless mistress, Myrtle Wilson, and imbues her with Cyndi Lauper vibes. Musical theatre star Loren Hunter, meanwhile, augments Guy Webster\u2019s excellent score with powerful renditions of period songs like I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes). Evans\u2019 emerging vision for Queensland Theatre seems to be as a timely interpreter of familiar IP.

Bangkok: If you\u2019ve spent any time on the streets here in the last few years, you would have almost certainly caught the unmistakable waft of marijuana. Maybe you even indulged, and why not? It has been legal, after all. When Thailand removed cannabis from its narcotics list in 2022 \u2013 the first Asian country to do so \u2013 18,000 or so marijuana parlours popped up around the country. Cannabis was decriminalised in Thailand in 2022, leading to a boom in dispensaries. Getty The shops were everywhere, like pubs in London. And if you didn\u2019t smell them first, you couldn\u2019t miss their flashing green neon signs in the shape of a marijuana leaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea behind decriminalisation was to boost Thailand\u2019s brand as a wellness destination, give farmers a new cash crop and free up space in overcrowded prisons. Related Article Drug reform \u2018As legal as garlic\u2019: High times in Thailand as marijuana is decriminalised Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed just the trick. Tourism makes up roughly 15 per cent of Thailand\u2019s GDP. Tycoon turned pro-business politician Anutin Charnvirakul was the champion behind decriminalisation. If that name sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he has been Thailand\u2019s prime minister since September, essentially in a caretaker role. On Sunday, his Bhumjaithai Party surpassed all expectations to win the most seats in the country\u2019s snap elections, meaning he\u2019s almost certain to stay in the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the face of it, this would be a positive for the cannabis industry\u2019s long-term health, no? Well, not necessarily. A blackboard illustrating cannabis strains for sale inside a dispensary in Bangkok. Bloomberg The cannabis trade has been a debacle of the former government\u2019s own making. With few regulations in place, it boomed in 2022, becoming an out-of-control beast that ensnared previous non-users, including minors. Family holidaymakers, meanwhile, were turned off because who wants to be walking the kids through streets thick with the smell of drugs?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA local backlash followed and, midway through last year, the ruling Pheu Thai party declared that cannabis could be sold only to someone with a doctor\u2019s prescription. The burgeoning industry was decimated overnight. Shops were already struggling because there was too much low-priced cannabis, too many outlets and too few customers. Many closed. Some began looking the other way on prescriptions, spawning a black market that operates not just in plain sight, but under big glowing signs. In 2022, Thailand became the first country in Asia to decriminalise cannabis. Bloomberg Survival has meant new strategies. One shop in the Sukhumvit area, for example, redesigned its frontage to resemble a pharmacy. I ask the server, Ramil, 26, if Bhumjaithai romping home in the election (though the party still needs to cobble together a coalition) is good news for the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d he says, with an inflection of enthusiasm. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d It has been a tough game for a long time now, he says. Cannabis flooded the market in 2022, cutting profit margins. \u201cAnd then maybe it stabilised. But then with the prescriptions, that hurt.\u201d Ramil, 26, behind the counter of a Bangkok marijuana parlour, which now looks more like a pharmacy. Zach Hope The most novel approach I\u2019ve seen is at a shop called Cloud Nine, also in Sukhumvit. On the footpath outside, an A-frame sign declares \u201cfree prescription with every purchase\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe asked the friendly, English-speaking server what it\u2019s all about. (English speakers are vital because the customers are mostly foreigners, with Australians high on that list.) It\u2019s all very simple, she says, asking not to be named or photographed. The cannabis trade has been a debacle of the former government\u2019s own making. Bloomberg \u201cIf you purchase the flower, you\u2019ll be consulting with a doctor. The doctor will diagnose you, asking \u2018what do you need it for and how much do you need?\u2019.\u201d Then, hey presto, a prescription!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no in-house doctor, she says. It\u2019s a telehealth hook-up to a nearby clinic. Does the doctor ever say no? \u201cNot really,\u201d she says. There\u2019s no need to book in advance and the whole process takes just a few minutes. \u201cWe won\u2019t sell without [a] prescription. That\u2019s the golden rule here,\u201d she says. \u201cTalking to my customers, a lot of them say, \u2018Oh, why do we have to do it here? Other shops, they don\u2019t do it\u2019. But we\u2019re doing it the right way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says she has no idea whether Bhumjaithai will do away with the prescription law introduced by the previous government. It seems unlikely. Though we could not get a response from Bhumjaithai amid its post-election bargaining with other parties, Anutin has previously argued that the loosening of the laws was always focused on medicinal marijuana, rather than recreational, use. Anutin Charnvirakul speaks to media at Bhumjaithai Headquarters as results come in favouring Bhumjaithai on election night on Sunday. Getty Images No party wants to touch the law now. Surveys show the overwhelming majority of Thais don\u2019t want recreational cannabis use legalised in their country. Meanwhile, even tourism bodies, concerned at losing high-value family holidaymakers, support reclassification. Visitor numbers in Thailand remain below pre-COVID levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of Thais invested their savings to open cannabis businesses that have already closed their doors. Others cling on precariously. The Thai government\u2019s experiment with marijuana has not only been sloppy. For some people, it has been a disaster.

Got it Share A A A\n\nA plan to boost Sydney\u2019s 24-hour economy has hit a major obstacle, with the NSW government scaling back plans for around-the-clock trading at a new $100 million inner-city cultural venue after the proposal sparked a wave of community objections over late-night noise. The NSW government has walked back a contentious trading plan for The Cutaway cultural hub in Barangaroo after the site was earmarked for 24/7 operations as part of broader push by Premier Chris Minns to \u201cbring Sydney back to life\u201d. The Cutaway during construction works last year. James Brickwood When completed this year, The Cutaway will include multiple event spaces carved into the headland beneath Barangaroo Reserve, with room to host large art installations, performances, festivals, concerts, gala dinners, fashion shows and events including Vivid Sydney. But less than a year after the 24/7 operating hours were proposed, those plans have been scaled back, with most events to be capped at midnight, with limited exceptions for major occasions such as New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOriginally, Placemaking NSW, the government agency overseeing the development, argued that 24-hour operations would advance the state\u2019s vision to boost nightlife, tourism and Sydney\u2019s global standing. The venue\u2019s location next to Barangaroo Metro station was cited as a major advantage, allowing for extended trading supported by improved public transport access. A concept image of what the new venue will look like when completed. The proposal quickly drew objections from residents of high-rise towers and community groups in Barangaroo and Millers Point. Concern centred on the cumulative impacts of late-night events, particularly noise, crowd control and disruption to residential amenity. Anne Crabb, president of the Millers Point Community Resident Action Group, said the scale and design of the venue heightened those fears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnlike current 24/7 venues such as The Crown casino and The Star, this is a huge and open cavernous space located on the harbourfront,\u201d she said. \u201cBarangaroo can and should be a vibrant cultural precinct, but this must not come at the expense of our long-standing residential community who will have to deal with the late-night impacts.\u201d The venue will have a capacity for almost 3000 patrons. James Brickwood Resident Rosalind Lehane said uninterrupted sleep would be jeopardised under a 24-hour trading model. \u201cThe proposed changes to The Cutaway of 24-hour noise and vibration are incompatible with this aim,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Exclusive\n\nCity life First look inside \u2018tree\u2019 sculptures to heal Barangaroo\u2019s scar Strata representatives from neighbouring towers also raised concerns about the venue\u2019s acoustic design. Strata managing agent Kate Maclachlan warned that the semi-enclosed structure could amplify sound and create \u201creverberation\u201d impacts. In a submission to the NSW government, Robert Spears claimed noise levels could be comparable to a \u201cFormula One grand prix race\u201d. \u201cIf you wanted to devise a scheme to make our city less liveable than it already is, then you would come up with this new Cutaway proposal,\u201d he wrote. In response to what planning documents described as \u201cstrong concerns\u201d, Placemaking NSW has scaled back the operating hours to 8am to midnight. Some noise controls will be applied from 10pm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvent patrons will be directed toward Barangaroo and Wynyard Walk, rather than through residential streets in Millers Point, and integrated ticketing will be encouraged to promote use of the metro. Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolau described the decision to wind back the 24-hour operations as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, arguing the city needed more late-night venues to counter the lingering effects of the pandemic and increased working from home. The 24/7 trading plan had sparked opposition from residents in the high-rise waterfront precinct. Sam Mooy \u201cIf you choose to live in Barangaroo \u2013 in the heart of a global city \u2013 a level of noise should be expected,\u201d he said. \u201cWe desperately need to ensure there are enough venues and facilities that are open 24/7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe venue could have hosted overnight concerts, creative events or live broadcasts of international sporting competitions. At the very least we should have given it a trial.\u201d He said expanding public transport to 24-hour operations could have also supported the safe dispersal of late-night crowds. NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues had supported the original operating hours, saying extended trading would facilitate a diverse range of events and encourage tourism. In revised plans, Placemaking NSW said the midnight finishing times would provide \u201ca more clearly defined and constrained operating regime that balances the role of The Cutaway as a thriving, unique and industry-leading cultural venue with the need to protect the amenity of surrounding residential areas.\u201d Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolaou said the revised plans were disappointing. Brook Mitchell\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokeswoman said operations would begin with a three-month trial and that trading hours \u201cmay be further relaxed to support what Sydneysiders and visitors are seeking\u201d. The changes remain subject to final approval from the NSW Department of Planning. The NSW government is taking steps to enhance the nighttime economy through reforms that have included simplified noise regulations, support for outdoor events and improvements to liquor licensing. Construction of The Cutaway is more than 85 per cent complete and the first events are expected to start by July.

The Cats superstar says Jacob Weitering has been cleared of any damage after he was taken to hospital following a heavy collision in Saturday night\u2019s clash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see the big fella has been cleared,\u201d Dangerfield said. Loading \u201cThat\u2019s a part of footy, unfortunately, it is the combative nature that we love. But it\u2019s great to see he\u2019s been cleared of any damage.\u201d Weitering was taken from the ground on a stretcher after Western Australian opponent Mitch Georgiades and teammate Sam Collins landed heavily on top of him during a marking contest.\n\nHe had scans on his chest and shoulder regions, but was cleared to fly back to Melbourne with the Victorian team on Sunday morning. \u201cHe was engaged with the WhatsApp group (last night), that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Dangerfield said. \u201cThat lit up last night.\u201d Dangerfield said the way Western Australians embraced the State Of Origin return meant the concept \u201cmight be around for a while\u201d, despite the prospect of injuries. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see injuries next week, unfortunately, as well, especially in the early parts of match simulation and practice when you are really getting used to full-on contact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou train it at this time of year, but you don\u2019t fully engage with high-speed collisions. So it is one of those things that it is a difficult game to predict, and it\u2019ll continue to be that way, I think, as long as we play it.\u201d Toby and Zak make a pact Greater Western Sydney antagonist Toby Greene and Butters made a pre-game pact to set an aggressive tone during Saturday night\u2019s clash against Western Australia at Perth Stadium in Perth. Which should come as a surprise to no one.\n\nThe feisty Butters found himself in a scrap with WA defender Tom Barrass when the home team were making a late charge to win back the lead. \u201cI think he got Toby a bit late, and I was just backing him up,\u201d Butters explained. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the Origin spirit. The game was pretty close at that point, so I really wanted to get the win. Zak Butters and Tom Barrass get up close and personal. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe spoke about it a little bit pre-game. We\u2019re both starting half-forward, so we said, we would try and set the tone in that area. I\u2019ve looked up to him (Greene) for a while now, obviously growing up as a kid. I really admire the way he plays, so it\u2019s good to do it with him.\u201d Butters agreed that he and Greene liked to play on the edge.\n\n\u201cI think I naturally do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes down a little bit to it sometimes, but I feel like we\u2019ve all created some good relations over the weekend. It helps me get involved in the game a little bit as well.\u201d No wonder Port are so desperate to keep their heart-and-soul vice-captain. Max makes room for more trophies Decorated ruckman Max Gawn has formed a love affair with Perth Stadium. He lifted the premiership cup at the ground as Melbourne captain in 2021, during the COVID-19 years, and can now add a victorious Victorian debut at the venue to his glowing resume.\n\nMax Gawn (right) and his former Melbourne teammate Luke Jackson, now with Fremantle, after the game.

We\u2019ve used lots of different things at times. And today, we used that Origin history.\n\nGawn said Lyon embraced the \u201cMr Origin\u201d role. \u201cHe\u2019s been good, Garry,\u201d he said. \u201cHis job was to really fire us up. I mean, Chris Scott, what I\u2019ve seen from Chris Scott, and the thing I\u2019ve taken the most out of this, is seeing what people that you have a view on are actually like. Victorian coach Chris Scott with his Geelong/Victorian players, Patrick Dangerfield, Max Holmes, Tom Stewart and Bailey Smith. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images \u201cAnd Chris Scott\u2019s one of them, for mine. I think the balance of Chris Scott and Gary Lyon was unbelievable. Chris Scott was so method-based, and leaving the game up to some of the star players we had. And then Garry was like, nah boys, we got to put a hip and shoulder right into these [guys] in the first contest.\n\nWe asked Gawn about his preconceived view of Scott. Loading \u201cI always thought he was cool, calm and collected. Sometimes I thought he was better than the game, but when you think about it, he\u2019s actually just putting so much to his players. \u201cHe\u2019s given his players a lot of flexibility in the way they want to play. And I really gelled with it, to be honest.\u201d Gawn was mic\u2019d up for the game and was looking forward to hearing his interaction with a star-studded midfield that included Marcus Bontempelli, Nick Daicos and Butters.\n\n\u201cThe young players kept coming up and saying, \u2019it\u2019s a pleasure to play with you and Danger and Gunston and some of these guys, Bont, who have been around for a long time. But the pleasure is all ours,\u201d Gawn said. \u201cThe fact that we can play with some of these Gen Z boys that are turning football into a new game \u2026 I mean, I didn\u2019t have the normal input I normally have in games because the game was chaotic, the game was weird, the game was Origin, which was fun.\u201d Suns pair reunited Gold Coast recruit Christian Petracca has well and truly embedded himself within the Suns playing group, according new teammate Sam Collins.\n\n\u201cI actually went school with Trac,\u201d Collins said after his State Of Origin debut for Victoria. \u201cSo, I knew the character that was coming across, and he\u2019s been sensational for all the boys. \u201cMore, to say, his energy and connection that he brings to the group. You know, he\u2019s opened his house up a number of times. \u201cHe\u2019s always looking to do things and bring the energy \u2026 so he\u2019s been sensational.\u201d",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Switch is officially Nintendo\u2019s best-selling game machine of all time, second only to Sony\u2019s landmark PlayStation 2 for overall sales. And the follow-up Switch 2 is off to a good start, moving more than 17 million units in its first half-year to become the fastest-selling game system ever. But with global component shortages, rising prices and slow adoption of the Switch 2 from some major game-makers, Nintendo faces serious challenges in keeping the momentum up throughout 2026. Major big-budget releases like Resident Evil Requiem can run on Switch 2, but not all publishers are supporting the system yet. Announcing the latest sales figures recently, president Shuntaro Furukawa said the rising price of memory \u2014 driven by the AI boom \u2014 wouldn\u2019timmediately affect the Switch 2 price, which is currently $700, but an increase may happen eventually. \u201cWe do not expect major impact during the fourth quarter of this year. However, from the next fiscal year onward, if this price hike lasts longer than anticipated, it could potentially put pressure on our profitability,\u201d he said, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what does the company have planned for 2026 to keep demand high enough to counter the headwinds? Mario Tennis Fever is Nintendo\u2019s first big Switch 2 exclusive of the year. Nintendo\u2019s own offerings With 155 million Switch consoles sold, Nintendo and other game publishers are keen to continue selling games on the eight-year-old device. Indie games and less graphically intensive games in particular continue to release for the original Switch, and also work on Switch 2. But slowly and surely, players will be encouraged to upgrade to the more expensive and much more powerful new machine. Nintendo\u2019s approach with its own software is to introduce some games that are exclusively for Switch 2, and some that work on either console but are significantly better on the beefier hardware, while also issuing free and paid updates that bring new Switch 2 features to older games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons, which was a huge driver of sales for Nintendo during the COVID lockdowns, received an update recently that bumps the game\u2019s graphics up to 4K, makes use of the Switch 2\u2019s mouse-style controls and microphone, and expands the multiplayer features. Next month, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Bros. Wonder will add extra characters, modes, levels and minigames. The advantage here is that the upgrade to Switch 2 gets more appealing the more original Switch games a person has, especially in the case of games like Super Mario Odyssey where the improvements are free. But it also means some games getting more expensive; if you don\u2019t already have Mario Bros. Wonder and want to buy it with the Switch 2 content included, it will cost $110. So far Nintendo has published five games exclusively for Switch 2 (pictured). But it has updated an equal number of original Switch games with exclusive new features, and launched Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 on both systems. At a recent event at Nintendo\u2019s Melbourne headquarters I was able to play early versions of some new and upcoming games. Mario Tennis Fever is exclusive to Switch 2, and it turns tennis into a party game akin to Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros, with powerful racquet effects and weird optional rules on certain courts giving players heaps to keep track of. On the other hand, Pok\u00e9mon Pokopia is clearly aiming for the broadest possible audience and is coming to both Switch and Switch 2. Co-developed by The Pok\u00e9mon Company, Game Freak and Koei Tecmo, it blends the collecting of Pok\u00e9mon and the social nature of Animal Crossing with the building recipes of Minecraft, but with the addition of some story elements to follow. Players take the role of a shape-shifting Ditto which has chosen the form of a human, and work to make a barren world habitable for a range of friendly creatures. It\u2019s surprisingly engrossing, and could turn out to be one of the year\u2019s sleeper hits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the year Nintendo is planning to release all-ages platformer Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, anime tactics RPG Fire Emblem: Fortune\u2019s Weave, and multiplayer action adventure The Duskbloods, from the developer of Dark Souls and Elden Ring From Software. The three are exclusive to Switch 2. The company often also announces new games before mid-year. The wider ecosystem As development of big-budget games has moved to more capable hardware, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, fewer have been released on the low-powered original Switch. The extra grunt of the Switch 2 could potentially correct that, but many major studios are yet to announce their blockbuster games for the portable system. Some analysts point to reports that Nintendo was unable to furnish many studios with Switch 2 hardware ahead of its launch. Major third-party games planned for, or recently released on, Switch 2 Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy VII Remake, with sequel Rebirth coming in June.\n\nUbisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s South of Midnight, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition and Oblivion Remastered, all due this year.\n\nAnticipated James Bond game 007 First Light, Sega\u2019s Yakuza Kiwami 3, and Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil Requiem will all launch on Switch 2 at the same time as other platforms in the coming months.\n\nResident Evil 7 and Village are arriving along with Requiem.\n\nEA and 2K\u2019s licensed sports games are supported on the system.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 and Street Fighter 6 were included at the system\u2019s launch.\n\nElden Ring is due to arrive this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the event I was able to preview a pair of upcoming Capcom games; Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata. These are games that would never have been able to run on the original Switch, but on Switch 2 they feel great and are visually impressive. If you had this version of Resident Evil side-by-side with a PlayStation 5 Pro running it at 4K and 60 frames per second with ray tracing, you\u2019d immediately spot that the Switch 2 isn\u2019t hitting the same resolution, performance or settings. But then a Switch 2 is almost half the price, and has the advantage of portable play. Both games looked awesome on the small handheld screen. So the issue currently isn\u2019t that the console is underpowered, but keen gamers still can\u2019t be assured the titles they\u2019re excited for on PC and consoles will come to Switch 2, purely because it would be an extra lift for studios that plan their releases years in advance. It\u2019s a catch-22, but more players may have to invest in Switch 2 before the studios consider it worth their while. The Virtual Boy is making a comeback on Switch and Switch 2. Meanwhile, Nintendo continues to expand its brand in all directions, outside new release games. A second Super Mario movie hits cinemas this year, with a live action Legend of Zelda currently filming. The Pikmin Bloom smartphone app, a take on Pok\u00e9mon GO which encourages users to explore by walking, is going strong after five years. And the company runs a subscription on Switch and Switch 2 that gives families access to classic games originally published in the \u201980s, \u201990s and 2000s. The latest console added to this collection, the Virtual Boy, is notable because it was originally a financial disaster. The heavy and headache-inducing 1995 VR headset sold less than a million units, had 22 games published for it and was pulled from shelves within a year, with Nintendo all but refusing to acknowledge it until recently. Next week, subscribers will be able to play games from the worst-selling Nintendo system ever on the best-selling, with Virtual Boy on Switch and Switch 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor's pick Exclusive\n\nVideo games 135 years of secrets: Nintendo is more than a video game company In my brief testing of the system, which requires a sold-separately viewer you slide your console into (Nintendo is selling both a $140 replica of the original headset and a $30 cardboard version), I was surprised to find the games still feel novel and interesting. They\u2019re monochrome, but the 3D visuals work. Smart filters and display options make them comfortable to look at, and it\u2019s all a reminder of what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s stayed the same in the past 30 years. If half a per cent of the Switch and Switch 2 audience get a new Virtual Boy, it will have reached more players than the original did back in the day.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s new leadership will seek to win back a reputation of party of lower taxes and better economic managers after former leader Peter Dutton nixed their tax cut proposals before the last election. Opposition Leader Angus Taylor and deputy Jane Hume said on Sunday they wanted to return their party to its roots and reprioritise boosting productivity, leaving the door open to budget cuts. Taylor said he wanted the Coalition to be the party of lower taxes. Alex Ellinghausen The pair held the shadow treasury and finance portfolios at the last election, when the Coalition under Peter Dutton opposed Labor\u2019s marginal tax cut and suggested the money be spent on defence instead. Taylor immediately conceded after ousting former leader Sussan Ley on Friday that policy had been a mistake and began pitching a directional change. \u201cAll Liberals know instinctively that the Liberal Party should always be, and must always be, a party of lower taxes because we know that when taxes are lower, Australians get a chance to get ahead,\u201d Jane Hume told ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday. \u201cWe know when taxes are lower, the economy grows without creating inflation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor identified the lack of tax cuts as a bad call in his first press conference as leader on Friday, and on Sunday said the best place to find money was through a non-inflationary, fast-growing economy. Asked about Dutton\u2019s decision to oppose Labor\u2019s tax cut, Taylor said: \u201cI proposed a way forward with lower personal income taxes, and that is already something I\u2019ve put on the record.\u201d \u201cWe need to convince Australians that we will be the party of lower taxes, and we will take a strong, strong policy package to the next election,\u201d Taylor said, speaking separately on Sky News. \u201cUnder Labor, we are seeing rising personal income taxes. I mean, they carry on about how they\u2019re bringing down personal income taxes. Well, fine, we made a mistake in the election campaign. But let me tell you, when inflation rages \u2013 and it goes up as it is under this hopeless treasurer \u2013 people pay more taxes as a proportion of their income,\u201d he said. Taylor said he had always advocated for lower taxes. Niki Savva, a columnist for this masthead, has reported Taylor and Hume had wanted to offer their own tax cut as a contrast to the surprise $5 a week tax cut Albanese revealed in the March budget last year. Dutton, according to Savva, was not interested in Taylor\u2019s plan to offer a tax-back guarantee for those forced into a higher tax bracket by inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor also denied he had worked to undermine Ley when he was on her frontbench. \u201cI sought to be a supporter of her leadership every single day,\u201d Taylor told Sky News. \u201cWe got to a point\u2026 where the view of the party room (was that) there needs to be a reset.\u201d While Taylor and Hume were on Sunday reluctant to detail policy so soon after taking control of the party, Hume said they would oppose any plan to reducing the capital gains tax discount \u2013 something neither Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have denied. This masthead revealed the government was considering a cut in the CGT concession as part of a broader tax reform package aimed at helping younger Australians to buy their own home. Jane Hume said the party was always open to lowering taxes. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat discussion has been had in the party room for some months,\u201d Hume said. \u201cWhether it be changes to negative gearing, whether it be changes to capital gains tax\u2026 Liberals know instinctively, when we talk to each other, that we are a party of lower taxes, and that if you tax something, there is less of it.\u201d Related Article Exclusive\n\nLiberal Party \u2018We were like lemmings going over a cliff\u2019: Inside Dutton\u2019s $17 billion blunder \u201cIf you tax residential housing, there will be less of it. That would be a disaster. No one has yet come out and demonstrated that a wholesale change to capital gains tax on residential housing will create more houses or provide more rental opportunities for rental houses for those that are yet to purchase their first home.\u201d Hume would not commit to any specific tax reforms but conceded \u201cmore of the same clearly isn\u2019t good enough\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not making policy on the run on Sunday morning, 48 hours after I\u2019ve become deputy leader,\u201d she said. \u201cAngus Taylor and I instinctively will always say lower taxes are better than higher taxes, and they\u2019re better for all Australians.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHume, who will get to choose her portfolio, foreshadowed an economic role. \u201cI am particularly interested in making sure I have an opportunity to talk about what\u2019s important to me, which is making sure that we have a far more productive economy,\u201d she said. Albanese attacked the new Coalition line-up on Sunday, saying his government would in July deliver the $5 a week tax cut they promised in the last election and one next year \u201cafter Angus Taylor led the charge to not only suppose but to say that he would legislate, if he hadn\u2019t been elected treasurer in the election less than a year ago, that he would legislate to actually increase taxes for all 14 million Australians\u201d.\n\n\n\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.
