    "text": "A weak and frail Pope Francis has returned home to the Vatican from the hospital after surviving a five-week, life-threatening bout of pneumonia, making a surprise stop at his favourite basilica on the way home before beginning two months of prescribed rest and recovery.\n\nThe motorcade carrying the 88-year-old pope entered the Perugino gate into Vatican City on Sunday morning (Sunday night AEDT), and Francis was seen in the front passenger seat wearing nasal tubes to give him supplemental oxygen.\n\nDuring the trip home from Gemelli hospital, Francis took a slight detour to bring him to the St Mary Major basilica, where his favourite icon of the Madonna is located and where he always goes to pray after a foreign visit. Francis didn't get out of the car, but handed a bouquet of flowers to the cardinal to place in front of the Salus populi Romani icon, a Byzantine-style painting on wood that is revered by Romans.\n\nPope Francis gestures as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, Sunday, March 23, 2025, where he has been treated for bronchitis and bilateral pneumonia since February 14. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\n\ufeffBefore leaving the hospital, Francis gave a thumbs up and acknowledged the crowd after he was wheeled out onto the balcony overlooking the main entry. Hundreds of people had gathered on a brilliant Sunday morning to say goodbye.\n\n\"I see this woman with the yellow flowers. Brava!\" a tired and bloated-looking Francis said. He gave a weak sign of the cross before being wheeled back inside.\n\nChants of \"Viva il papa!\" and \"Papa Francesco\" erupted from the crowd, which included patients who had been wheeled outside just to catch his brief appearance.\n\nDoctors, who announced his planned release at a Saturday evening (early Sunday AEDT) news conference, said he needs two months of rest and convalescence, during which he should refrain from meeting with big groups of people or exerting himself. But they said eventually he should be able to resume all his normal activities.\n\nHis return home, after the longest hospitalisation of his 12-year papacy and the second-longest in recent papal history, brought tangible relief to the Vatican and Catholic faithful who have been anxiously following 38 days of medical ups and downs and wondering if Francis would make it.\n\n\"Today I feel a great joy,\" said Dr Rossella Russomando, a doctor from Salerno who didn't treat Francis but was at Gemelli on Sunday.\n\n\"It is the demonstration that all our prayers, all the rosary prayers from all over the world, brought this grace.\"\n\nPope Francis gestures as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\nPope is happy to go home\n\nAt the Vatican on Sunday, pilgrims flocked as they have all year to St Peter's Basilica to participate in the 2025 Holy Year. They swarmed St Peter's Square and progressed through the Holy Door in groups, while big TV screens in the square were turned on to broadcast Francis' hospital greeting live.\n\nNo special arrangements have been made at the Domus Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel next to the basilica where Francis lives in a two-room suite on the second floor. Francis will have access to supplemental oxygen and 24-hour medical care as needed, though his personal physician, Dr Luigi Carbone, said he hoped Francis would progressively need less and less assistance breathing as his lungs recover.\n\nWhile the pneumonia infection has been successfully treated, Francis will continue to take oral medication for quite some time to treat the fungal infection in his lungs and continue his respiratory and physical physiotherapy.\n\n\"For three or four days he's been asking when he can go home, so he's very happy,\" Carbone said.\n\nFaithful and nuns wait a Pope Francis appearing at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, Sunday, March 23, 2025 (AP Photo/Riccardo De Luca)\n\nTwo life-threatening crises\n\nThe Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on February 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\n\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs. Blood tests showed signs of anemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which later resolved after two blood transfusions.\n\nThe most serious setbacks began on February 28, when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring the use of a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe. He suffered two more respiratory crises a few days later, which required doctors to manually aspirate \"copious\" amounts of mucus from his lungs, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.\n\nPope Francis waves as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nHe was never intubated and at no point lost consciousness. Doctors reported he always remained alert and cooperative, though they say he has probably lost a bit of weight given a natural loss of appetite.\n\n\"Unfortunately yes, there was a moment when many were saying that he might not make it. And it was painful for us,\" said Mario Balsamo, the owner of coffee shop in front of Gemelli.\n\n\"Instead, today with the discharge, we are very happy that he is well and we hope he will recover soon and will recover his strength.\"\n\nPope Francis leaves in a car the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Marco Ravagli)\n\n'I'm still alive!'\n\nDr Sergio Alfieri, the medical and surgical chief at Gemelli who coordinated Francis' medical team, stressed that not all patients who develop such a severe case of double pneumonia survive, much less are released from the hospital. He said Francis' life was at risk twice, during the two acute respiratory crises, and that the pope at the time understandably lost his typical good sense of humour.\n\n\"But one morning we went to listen to his lungs and we asked him how he was doing. When he replied, 'I'm still alive,' we knew he was OK and had gotten his good humor back,\" he said.\n\nAlfieri confirmed that Francis was still having trouble speaking due to the damage to his lungs and respiratory muscles. But he said such problems were normal, especially in older patients, and predicted his voice would eventually return to normal.\n\nPope Francis waves as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (Francesco Sforza/Vatican press office via AP)\n\nNo confirmed appointments for now\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to confirm any upcoming events, including a scheduled audience on April 8 with King Charles III or Francis' participation in Easter services at the end of the month. But Carbone said he hoped Francis might be well enough to travel to Turkey at the end of May to participate in an important ecumenical anniversary.\n\nFrancis is also returning to the Vatican in the throes of a Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration scheduled to draw more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome this year. The pope has already missed several Jubilee audiences and will presumably miss several more, but Vatican officials say his absence hasn't significantly impacted the numbers of expected pilgrims arriving.\n\nOnly St John Paul II recorded a longer hospitalisation in 1981, when he spent 55 days at Gemelli for minor surgery and treatment of an infection.",

(Dion Georgopoulos)\n\n\"Most large-scale developers reckon that prices have to rise 15-20 per cent to make taking on the risk of developing new projects viable,\" Yardney said.\n\n\"This isn't just about greed; it's about sustainability.\n\n\"If prices continue to stagnate \u2013 or worse, fall \u2013 then the incentive to build diminishes, further exacerbating the shortage.\"\n\nOver the past 25 years, the median house value nationally has risen by 412 per cent, or $459,900, figures from Aussie Home Loans reveal.\n\nAnd according to the latest figures released by the ABS, the average price of homes in Australia is now a staggering $976,800.\n\nThe median house price has risen by 412 per cent in the past 25 years.

    "text": "The SA government says it \"cannot commit\" to stamping out a practice that enables child protection authorities to formally \"close\" cases of suspected abuse or neglect because there aren't enough staff to investigate them.\n\nWARNING: This story contains details some readers may find distressing.\n\nLast year, State Coroner David Whittle recommended the Department for Child Protection (DCP) scrap the practice of marking cases as \"closed no action\", which occurs when there are not enough resources to conduct a formal follow-up.\n\nThe recommendation came out of a coronial inquest into the November 2018 death of an 11-week-old baby who had been living in squalid conditions, and whose family had been the subject of 23 notifications to child protection authorities.\n\nThe coroner recommended that the practice of marking child protection cases as \"closed\" because of lack of resourcing be discontinued beyond this month, unless there was \"specific approval in writing\" from DCP's chief executive.\n\nHe also recommended that the practice be completely phased out by late December 2025.\n\nSqualid conditions inside the home of an 11-week-old baby boy who died in 2018. (Supplied: SA Courts)\n\nBut in a tabled report responding to the recommendations, prepared by DCP and the Department for Health and Wellbeing, the recommendation was accepted only \"in principle\".\n\nThe government said it \"cannot commit\" to either a \"specific time frame for phasing out\" the practice, or to the proposed interim option involving written approval from the department's chief executive.\n\nNotification recommendation rejected\n\nThe coroner's recommendation was itself based on a recommendation from South Australia's 2016 Child Protection Systems Royal Commission, which stipulated a five-year time frame for implementation.\n\nMr Whittle said that, until his recommendation was fully implemented, \"further potentially preventable deaths of children\" would continue to occur among cases designated as \"'closed no action' due to a lack of resources\".\n\nIn its response, the government said while notifications increased by 83 per cent in the wake of the royal commission's report, \"significant inroads\" had been made to increase the capacity to respond.\n\nIt said \"systemic changes\" had been introduced \"which improve the capacity of the state to offer a more targeted response\", and that SA was now a national leader in completing investigations within \"nationally agreed time frames\".\n\nThe state government accepted the recommendation \"in principle\". (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nThe government rejected a separate coronial recommendation that those who make child protection notifications be told \"if the notification they make is subsequently 'closed no action'\".\n\nThe government argued that implementing the recommendation could have \"unintended consequences\" such as \"compromising an SA Police investigation or dissuading a notifier from making future notifications\" \u2014 outcomes, it said, that \"could compromise the safety\" of children or young people.\n\nAccording to the 2016 royal commission, the designation \"closed no action\" is applicable in child protection cases assessed as Tier 2 or Tier 3.\n\nWhile Tier 3 cases involve \"low risk of further harm or low-level care concerns\", a Tier 2 classification applies where there is a \"moderate to high risk of significant harm\" and requires a response \"within five or 10 days\".\n\n\"If the child is 12 months or younger, the response should be within three days,\" the commission's summary report states.\n\n'Significant missed opportunity'\n\nIn his 2024 coronial findings, Mr Whittle noted the infant's mother had been the subject of 23 notifications to the department between 2015 and the baby's death, some of which were closed because the department's regional office which handled the file had no staff.\n\nMany of the notifications related to the squalid conditions the baby and his two siblings were living in.\n\nThe baby died surrounded by rubbish on a fold-out sofa, in which he had been sleeping with four people, including his mother.\n\nFootage played at the inquest showed the house covered in rubbish, cat faeces and soiled nappies, with mouldy baby bottles and no food in the kitchen.\n\nSeveral people including the baby boy had been sleeping on a fold-out sofa. (Supplied)\n\nThe coroner found the boy's mother should have ensured the infant was put to sleep in a \"clean, well-set-up cot\", but that she had \"consistently\" demonstrated over a number of years \"that she struggled to meet her parenting responsibilities\".\n\nMr Whittle found that, had DCP responded to a notification made days before the child died, he would have been removed from the home instead of being left to sleep on the fold-out couch.\n\nHe also said an earlier notification, made six months before the baby was born, created another opportunity for the department to intervene.\n\n\"The inability of DCP to respond to this notification, resulting in a closure of this notification without any further inquiries being made, was a significant missed opportunity,\" he said.",

Natalia was not present during the proceedings and was informed of the change while hospitalised at a nearby facility.\n\nFollowing the change in Natalia's birth year, her adoptive parents moved her into her own apartment and helped her obtain disability payments.\n\nShortly after, local child safety authorities received a report that Natalia was an abandoned child. An investigation was opened and ultimately discarded due to the legal change in Natalia's birth year.\n\nThe Barnetts moved Natalia into a different apartment, paying for one year's rent but did not provide additional financial support, before moving to Canada with their biological children.\n\nThis would be one of the last times Natalia saw the Barnetts.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nShortly after the Barnetts moved to Canada, Natalia befriended couple Antwon and Cynthia Mans and soon moved in with them.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, the Mans attempted to rectify Natalia's situation by applying for guardianship.\n\nMichael filed an objection to this request citing Natalia's age-change order, with the court suggesting the Mans reverse the order before attempting to apply for guardianship again.\n\nNatalia Grace with Antwon and Cynthia Mans during the filming of the second season of Investigation Discovery's The Curious Case of Natalia Grace. (Supplied: Warner Bros)\n\nThen, for two-and-a-half years, things went relatively quiet. Until September 2019, when Kristine and Micheal Barnett were both charged with neglect, in separate cases, over their treatment of Natalia.\n\nLess than two weeks after the charges went public, the Barnetts \u2014 who had, by then, divorced \u2014 went on a media blitz.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Kristine claimed that she became suspicious of Natalia's age after she saw the girl had \"full pubic hair\". She also assumed that Natalia had already started menstruating.\n\nKristine claimed that Natalia was violent and had tried to hurt her sons and herself, including trying to push her into an electric fence and standing over her with knives.\n\nMichael repeated claims that Natalia was violent towards the family, including placing thumb tacks around the house for them to step on, in an October 2019 interview with Good Morning America.\n\nHe also appeared twice on The Dr. Oz Show and once on Inside Edition, as well as on news outlets in the Indianapolis television market.\n\nDue to the overwhelming media attention, a local judge issued a gag order on Kristine and Michael Barnett on October 28, 2019.\n\nA month later, Natalia conducted a TV interview with Dr Phil where she denied all claims that she tried to harm the Barnetts or their sons.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nWhere does Orphan fit into it all?\n\nOrphan is a 2009 horror film that centres on a nine-year-old Russian orphan, Esther, who is adopted into an American family. After Esther starts murdering the people around her, it's revealed that she's actually a 33-year-old woman, using her short stature to pose as a child.\n\nIn Kristine Barnett's original interview with the Daily Mail, the film is heavily referenced in relation to Natalia's story.\n\nIn the second season of docu-series The Curious Case Of Natalia Grace, Natalia claims that the film is what inspired her adoptive parents' crusade against her.\n\n\"The things that Kristine and Michael have said that I've done is a lie. It was all copied off the movie Orphan,\" Natalia says in the series.\n\n\"Ukrainian girl, Russian girl, check. Orphan, check. All this crazy stuff. Standing at the end of the bed with a knife, check.\"\n\nWere Kristine and Michael Barnett convicted of neglect?\n\nNo.\n\nMichael Barnett was acquitted of neglect charges by an Indiana jury in late 2022.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors argued that the Barnetts abandoned Natalia in a second-floor apartment where she was unable to navigate the stairs and was without a walker or wheelchair or any knowledge of the city.\n\nKristin and Michael Barnett were arrested and charged with neglect but were never convicted. (Supplied: Warner Bros)\n\nShe testified that she learned nearly everything about life, including how to read, write and wash her hair from the Mans.\n\nHowever, the defence successfully argued that Natalia \"wanted nothing to do with the Barnetts. She had moved on.\"\n\nThree weeks before Kristine Barnett's trial was set to start, her charges were dismissed, with the County Prosecutor citing \"insufficient evidence\".\n\nWhere is Natalia Grace now?\n\nIn 2023, following medical tests and DNA analysis, Natalia's birth year was restored to 2003.\n\nShe conducted an interview with People magazine in January 2025 where she shared that she \"escaped\" the Mans home in 2023 after they became controlling and restrictive of who she could talk to.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nShe now lives with friends, married couple Nicole and Vincent DePaul, who also have dwarfism, and their family, and is currently studying for her high school diploma.\n\n\"It's a blessing to be alive today because, looking back \u2026 I should have been dead,\" she says.\n\nIs Good American Family a true story?\n\nLike many recent \"based on a true story\" miniseries, viewers should take the events presented in Good American Family with a grain of salt.\n\nThe series is \"inspired\" by Natalia's story but told from multiple perspectives in order to \"explore issues of perspective, bias, and trauma\" according to promotional material.\n\nBut the series' star has confirmed it's not a completely factual retelling of the strange and sad saga.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\n\"We're coming up with our own version of what this story could have been, so this isn't sort of a beat-for-beat of what their experience was,\" Ellen Pompeo, who plays Kristine Barnett, told Variety.\n\n\"It's really what we do here, I guess, in Hollywood.

    "text": "Labor says it has saved another $720 million on private consultants, part of $2.1 billion in cuts to be included in Tuesday's federal budget as it prepares for an election tussle over the level of government spending.\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher said returning \"expensive\" outsourced work to government departments \u2014 which has yielded $4.7 billion in total savings across Labor's first term \u2014 was more cost effective than the Coalition's proposal to cut public servants.\n\n\"It has meant we can invest in the things that matter most, like cost of living support, Medicare, and housing,\" she said.\n\nLabor promises to shave $150 off energy bills Photo shows chalmers side profile The federal government will extend its energy bill subsidies until the end of 2025 as it frames its re-election pitch to voters around the cost of living.\n\nBut the $2.1 billion reduction is comfortably less than the new spending that will be in the budget, including $8.5 billion for bulk billing and $1.8 billion to extend energy bill subsidies.\n\nAnd the figure includes \"re-prioritisations\" \u2014 spending reductions that are cancelled out by a spending increase elsewhere in the same portfolio.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged a similar bottom line to December's mid-year budget update, so the gap between the new spending and the cuts is likely to be funded by upgrades to the estimates of how much tax will be collected.\n\nThe Coalition has matched most of Labor's new spending and promises new spends of its own, including $5 billion for housing infrastructure and an unspecified taxpayer cost to build nuclear power plants, likely well in excess of $100 billion.\n\nBut Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said the Coalition would spend less overall than whatever Labor offers voters on Tuesday.\n\n\"We'll put out more costings before the election [but] I'll say that, in aggregate, our position will be stronger than Labor's,\" he told the ABC's Insiders on Sunday.\n\nCoalition spending rule fuels Labor accusation of secret cuts\n\nMr Taylor said he would restore a budget rule that real spending can grow no faster than the economy, measured over both the four-year forward estimates period and the ten-year medium term period.\n\nLabor's own medium-term projections suggest that level would not be breached on average over the next decade, but it would be breached for the 2024-25 financial year, and several key spending areas are growing much faster, including the NDIS, aged care, health and defence spending.\n\nFastest growing areas of spending over the next decade (MYEFO) Debt interest costs 10.9% a year NDIS 8.2% Defence 6.6% Hospitals 6.3% MBS 5.7% Child care 5.5% Aged care 5.2%\n\nThat has prompted Labor accusations that the Coalition plans \"secret cuts\" to frontline services to meet its target, which it denies.\n\nAsked whether there was a specific growth target for the NDIS, finance spokesperson Jane Hume said \"the most important thing is in the long-term that all government spending doesn't grow faster than the economy itself\" and added she hoped Labor would \"work with us\" on containing costs.\n\nNDIS costs were slated to grow at 14 per cent a year when Labor took office, but that is now 8 per cent after new legislation passed with Coalition support.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said the Coalition was \"making it up as it goes along\" on the NDIS and that this \"would send a shiver up the spine of people who rely on the program\".\n\nParties stake out positions on health, energy, defence\n\nElsewhere, the government has ruled out boosting the level of defence spending again this budget, having promised new spending in the last budget after its strategic review. Mr Taylor said the Coalition would reveal its own intentions after the budget.\n\n'No ambiguity' on Coalition public service and migration cuts Photo shows A close up shot of Angus Taylor standing in front of an Australian flag. Angus Taylor confirms the Coalition plans to reduce overall government spending growth and temporary migrant numbers, but says figures will be finalised after Tuesday's budget.\n\nAnd while the Coalition has matched Labor's expanded energy bill relief, after opposing earlier rounds, Peter Dutton on Sunday said it was evidence Labor had failed to reduce power bills.\n\nBut the taxpayer cost of the Coalition's own plan to build taxpayer-funded nuclear power plants is unclear. Party-commissioned modelling suggests the total system cost would be $331 billion over several decades, but Mr Taylor said on Sunday much of the cost would fall on the private sector.\n\nIn health, the Coalition has matched most new Labor initiatives, including $25 PBS medicines and the new bulk billing incentive.\n\nIt also proposes to restore the 10 additional Medicare-subsidised therapy sessions that expired under Labor, but it does not have a position on Labor's 50 new urgent care clinics, instead announcing four of its own in marginal seats.",

    "text": "For months the conventional political wisdom has been that a federal budget must be avoided \u2014 because Anthony Albanese's government would have to hand down a deficit and that would serve as a reminder to the public that the country is in structural financial trouble.\n\nBut we are now in a new paradigm.\n\nThe federal budget is on the cusp of being delivered \u2014 and the government is holding the talking stick just when it needs it most.\n\nWe are in the Theatre of the Absurd \u2014 journalists will be locked up for hours on Tuesday to write countless stories about the government's budget two minutes before an election. The budget is therefore almost entirely a manifesto for re-election.\n\nThis isn't to suggest that there aren't risks for the government in having to publish so much detail about the country's fiscal position. But consider this: the country's entire media establishment is about to be ensconced in writing and broadcasting information about the government's budget and agenda at a time when attention is the commodity all politicians need more of.\n\nWith so many soft voters who haven't really made their minds up, attention is of great value right now. Your attention is what they are seeking, and they will be reaching for it everywhere they possibly can in the next week.\n\nChris Hayes, the host of MSNBC's \"All In With Chris Hayes\" in the US, has recently written a fascinating book about the corrosive consequences of the attention economy called \"The Sirens' Call: How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource\u201d.\n\nIn it he makes the case that attention is the world\u2019s most valuable resource. And the people who are winning right now (think Donald Trump) deeply understand its value and how to use it.\n\nAs the political fight for our attention is what matters most right now, is a budget really the way to do that? Well, no, not on its own. But in the fight for attention, the budget gives the government the best chance of slipping into your limited attention space.\n\nLoading...\n\nGovernment has the momentum\n\nWhen Albanese appeared on influencer Abbie Chatfield's podcast for a 90-minute chat, it wasn't just for a soft interview \u2014 it was about getting into the social media feeds he would never usually appear in. Go ask any girl in their teens and twenties. Albanese appeared, for the first time ever, in some of their video reels. The power of that cannot be dismissed.\n\nThe past few weeks have been good for the government \u2014 the momentum is finally going their way. It has taken Labor some time to land any punches on Peter Dutton, who has proven to be an underestimated and formidable opponent, capable of switching the conversation into territory he prefers.\n\nCoalition MPs told to hose down prospect of referendum on criminal dual nationals Photo shows Peter Dutton is shown at a press conference. He's wearing glasses and a black suit with an Australian flag behind him. Peter Dutton's decision to float the idea of holding a national vote on criminal dual citizens has Liberal MPs privately questioning the Coalition's messaging and strategy.\n\nDutton's problem over the past week was by trying to switch the conversation to foreign criminals with dual citizenship, in the absence of context or a genuine crisis, his message fell flat.\n\nThe Albanese government has often been left flat-footed in the parliament. When Dutton has switched the conversation to national security in the past, it has made the government defensive and worried because they feel it's traditionally uncomfortable territory for them.\n\nBut something weird is happening. Some senior Labor figures are actively hoping Dutton uses the week ahead to stray into these areas rather than fearing him as they have in the past. The reason? They are now building a case that Dutton is not ready to govern on the economy and has no cost-of-living solutions.\n\nTheir case is made best when the opposition leader strays away from the economy.\n\nA senior Coalition source said Dutton must use the opposition leader's budget-reply speech to launch a few new policies. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nBudget reply a major test for Dutton\n\nAll budgets are about expectation management. This year, budget expectations have been set deliberately low \u2014 which again favours the government. Will there or won't there be tax relief and who will offer it? Does either side have a plan to get the budget back to surplus?\n\nThis is as much a test for Dutton as it is for the government. The treasurer might have the talking stick in the next few days, but by Thursday it's the opposition leader who will have it. How he uses it is perhaps his most important moment so far this year. Will he make an economic case, or rely on territory he has visited before?\n\nA senior government source said while the government had lost almost every parliamentary week last year, they won the final two and the first two this year, and the week ahead was the most crucial because it was no longer a theoretical contest \u2014 time is up.\n\nThe government will heap pressure on Dutton, framing his Thursday budget reply as not just a speech but a career and election-defining moment. The level of difficulty for Dutton to stay on his preferred ground is huge.\n\nThe Party Room Want to know what's really going on in Parliament House? Fran Kelly and Patricia Karvelas give you the political analysis that matters and explain what it means for you.\n\nA senior Coalition source said Dutton must use the opposition leader's budget reply speech to launch a few new policies and muddy the waters for Labor leading up to the election.\n\nThere are other curve balls about to come the government's way, including the Reserve Bank board meeting the following week, which is likely to be the first week of the election campaign.\n\nWhile the one rate cut undoubtedly improved sentiment around the economy, which helped the government, the Reserve Bank could pour cold water on it this time around.\n\nA senior Labor figure said questions remained about how a budget deficit would be received by voters. And if the Reserve Bank board meeting suggested no more rate cuts until September at the earliest, would that take wind out Albanese's sails?\n\nThere's a few speed bumps coming up for the government to navigate. How they frame them and capture voters' attention will matter most.\n\nPatricia Karvelas is presenter of ABC TV's Q+A, host of ABC News Afternoon Briefing at 4pm weekdays on ABC News Channel, co-host of the weekly Party Room podcast with Fran Kelly and host of politics and news podcast Politics Now.",

The nation was transfixed and late-middle-aged men the country over dared to dream.\n\nWith that win, Cliff Young became an instant folk hero. Songs and books were written about him and his story was turned into a film (although there's no evidence the writers of the 1994 movie Forrest Gump had heard of him, despite the parallels).\n\n\"Had Tony Rafferty or myself won it, I think it would have been an interesting news story that would have faded within a couple of weeks,\" says John Connellan, who at 28 was the youngest runner in that race.\n\n\"But for someone like Cliff to do it, that really sparked the Australian imagination.\"\n\nCliff Young (bottom centre) and his brother Syd (behind) with fellow Beech Forest farmers. (Supplied: The Otway Districts Historical Society)\n\nThere was something both triumphant and slightly comic about Young's victory that struck a chord. Australians take pride in national sporting achievements but there's a subversive streak in our psyche that draws us to the underdog.\n\nWe cheer our Cathy Freemans and Ian Thorpes but hold a special affection for the unlikely heroes, those hare-and-the-tortoise champions such as Steven Bradbury, skating to Olympic gold from last place as the rest of the field toppled like bowling pins before him.\n\nCliff Young seemed both the embodiment of Australia's larrikin spirit and the kind of unthreatening everyman that only the most hardened cynic could fail to get behind.\n\nThe ultramarathon community gave Young a sense of belonging that he craved.

(ABC Archives)\n\nWestfield had put out a call to its marketing team two years earlier for an idea that would put the shopping centre company on the map. It was Martin Noonan who suggested a race between Westfield complexes in Parramatta and Doncaster, but as race day approached management got wind of Young's participation and baulked.\n\n\"The words I got told was, 'We're not going to have some old geriatric die on the Hume Highway during our race',\" Noonan says. He was told to sort out the situation so he invited Young to Melbourne for a jog to see what they were dealing with.\n\nYoung (far right) at the finish line of the 1982 Melbourne Marathon. He ran the marathon every year from 1979-82, setting a personal best of 3:02:53 at age 58. (Supplied: State Library of Victoria/Rennie Ellis)\n\n\"We went for about three hours and we start hitting this hill,\" Noonan recalls. \"Conversation ceases. I'm putting on some pressure because I wasn't too bad of a runner back then but, bugger me, he's still on me shoulder. I'm thinking I'm 27; this guy is 61. This is an outlier.\"\n\nWhat Noonan discovered that day was that Cliff Young was a genuinely gifted runner and his imminent victory wouldn't be quite as miraculous as it appeared to a startled nation. In a sense, Young had been preparing for this race his entire life.\n\nAn eccentric man wanting to belong\n\nExactly when Young started running for pleasure is not entirely clear, but Otway Ranges locals had long become used to seeing him jogging along roads and through fields. The nearest major town, Colac, was 40 kilometres from his home in Beech Forest and Young would think nothing of running there and back.\n\nCliff Young at his Beech Forest home where he lived with his mother Mary. (Supplied: The Otway Districts Historical Society)\n\nBecause of the frequent rain, he sometimes ran in gumboots, which strengthened his legs and contributed to an unusual way of running \u2014 an economical and deceptively quick style that would in time become known as the Cliff Young Shuffle.\n\nHe certainly would have seemed an eccentric figure.\n\n\"People thought he was a bit crazy and so Cliff really didn't belong,\" recalls journalist and friend Neil Kearney. \"What he wanted was to belong.\"\n\nMore than 40 years on, many runners still believe the \"Cliff Young shuffle\" is a highly efficient way to run long distances. (Supplied: Channel 10)\n\nIt was when Young was introduced to the long-distance running community that he found his tribe and he never looked back. In 1978, he ran the first Melbourne marathon wearing Fletcher Jones trousers and a thick jumper, easily winning his age group. He was soon running much longer races and established a reputation as a smart runner.\n\n\"I knew him from races that he had been competing in,\" recalls renowned Irish-born runner Tony Rafferty, who finished the Sydney to Melbourne race almost two days behind Young.\n\n\"I said, this man is tough. The general public didn't know that; I did. I was almost sure that Cliff would finish that race and it would even be perhaps a race between the two of us.\"\n\nTony Rafferty, left and right (pictured in yellow in 1983), was a favourite to win the race. He was the first to run from Fremantle to Surfers Paradise, and in 1975, he set a world record for running 50 hours non-stop. (Supplied: Channel 10 / Australian Story)\n\nLost sleep and missing toenails \u2014 the mental game begins\n\nYoung's age, while notable, didn't raise as many eyebrows among runners as it did elsewhere. Long-distance running is a peculiar sport that doesn't necessarily favour the young. While sprinters peak in their mid to late 20s, long-distance runners tend to do best in their mid-40s and continue to perform well beyond that.\n\nBut it was mindset where Young possibly had the greatest advantage. By all accounts he was a happy and uncomplicated man; not an over-thinker. That is a temperament ideally suited to ultramarathon running, which is as much a mental challenge as a physical one. Long-distance runners must spend countless hours alone with their thoughts and unrelenting pain.\n\n\"You go through quite extraordinary emotional highs and lows; really dark times,\" says Connellan, who dropped out of the race on day four.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I am a thinker, so I think things through, and if you head down the wrong rabbit hole, it's not good for you.\"\n\nYoung seemed impervious to the mental anguish and was able to push aside the pain \u2014 the shoulder that he damaged in a fall outside Yass on the first day and the toll on his feet that saw him lose eight toenails by the end of the race.\n\nThe youngest competitor in the race, and a two-hour, 35-minute marathoner, Connellan dropped out of the Sydney to Melbourne race on day four. (Supplied: John Connellan / Australian Story)\n\nAnd then there were Young's tactics \u2014 perhaps unintentional, some might say underhand, but extremely effective. There was a gentleman's agreement that the runners would sleep until dawn, but on the first night Young's team masseur set the alarm clock incorrectly and Young woke just after 2am.\n\nHe set out, eventually asking the crew why he'd been running for hours and it was still dark. By that time, however, he was 30 kilometres in front and the wise move seemed to be to just keep going.\n\nThat simple mistake gave Young an unassailable lead at the start of day two and revolutionised long-distance running in the process.\n\nFive days, 14 hours, and four minutes later, at 1:25 am, Young crossed the finish line in front of a crowd of thousands. (Getty Images: Tony Feder)\n\nGhandi in gumboots: Cliff Young becomes a legend\n\nAfter winning the race, Young experienced the kind of instant celebrity that has brought many undone, before and since. But he took the attention in his stride, both seemingly at ease with success and not quite believing his luck.\n\nThere was something almost savant-like about this shy, uncomplicated man but those who knew him insist that he was a simple man, not a simpleton. If Australia was laughing at him, he seemed to be in on the joke.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn some ways Young represented a blank canvas on which the public could project their hopes and desires. To many his austere lifestyle and uncomplicated bearing suggested an almost spiritual quality and he quickly earned the sobriquet '\"Ghandi in gumboots\".\n\nRace sponsor Westfield hosted a second wedding ceremony for Cliff Young and Mary Howell. (Supplied: Instagram/@maryhowell86)\n\nOthers, however, had more earthly concerns. One aspect of the sudden attention that did change Young's life was the interest he began to receive from women, something he was ill-prepared for. According to Martin Noonan, the love letters started coming halfway through the race and in the heady aftermath Young was inundated with attention.\n\nIt wasn't long before Young found himself a girlfriend, 22-year-old Mary Howell, and they were married later that year. The more-than-40-year age difference did not go unnoticed at the time but looking back at news coverage the tone was one of unqualified celebration.\n\nWhen Young met Howell she was 22, a 40-plus-year age difference that raised eyebrows. The marriage lasted for about five years. (Getty Images: Tony Feder)\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly given the age difference, the marriage didn't last and five years later he was single again.\n\n\"Cliff had led a bachelor's life for 61 years, so it was never going to be easy as a relationship,\" Neil Kearney reflects.\n\n\"Some people think he was a silly old bugger about Mary but that's just life.\"\n\nStill sporting ventilation holes in his pants, Young continued running well into his 70s.

(Supplied: Twinnies Seabird Rescue)\n\nWhen Young died in 2003, 20 years after his historic win, he was still well known enough that his funeral received national media coverage.\n\n\"He was a little fella who became larger than life,\" fellow competitor John Connellan says.\n\n\"And everyone who was alive at that time, remembers Cliff as much as they remember the man landing on the Moon. Probably both as unlikely as each other.\"\n\nA memorial gumboot in honour of Cliff Young in his hometown of Beech Forest.

Though there are multiple local variations of bratwurst in Germany, for the most part, these sausages are made with pork meat, which is ground and mixed with marjoram, along with mace, coriander and other spices, stuffed into sausage casing and then \u2013 ideally \u2013 cooked over coals.\n\nFirst serve There\u2019s evidence that sausages were being made in what is now Germany as far back as Celtic times, in the third or fourth century BC. The first recorded mention of a bratwurst, however, was in 1313, in the city of Nuremberg. During the 15th century the craze really kicked off, with local versions appearing in Thuringia, Coburg, and St Gallen in Switzerland. In 1567, the official recipe for Nuernberger bratwurst was settled upon \u2013 these uber-popular snags are small and thin, and are typically served (to this day) with three in a bun, topped with mustard.",

Got it Share\n\nAfter spending the past four years under the same roof on Oxford Street in Paddington, two of Sydney\u2019s hottest hospitality venues are combining their talents to open a wine bar. Chef\u2019s hatted bistro Porcine, known for its \u201cwhole beast\u201d approach to cooking meat, and its downstairs neighbour, P&V Merchants, a bottleshop selling natural and independent wines, will open L\u2019Avant Cave this week in the rear courtyard of the terrace on the ground level. Pigeon liver Melba toast will be one of the snacks on the menu at L\u2019Avant Cave. Supplied The two have dabbled before, with Porcine supplying a terrine here and there to P&V, but the flatmates are now all-in on the joint venture. \u201cWe\u2019re off the sofa and into the bedroom,\u201d Porcine chef Nicholas Hill joked about the professional partnership. L\u2019Avant Cave opens on Friday, March 28, inspired by wine bars in France such as P&V co-owner Mike Bennie\u2019s Parisian favourite, L\u2019Avant Comptoir, in the 6th arrondissement. Hill has his own Parisian influences, including wine bars with great food but \u201cno knives and forks\u201d \u2013 inspiration for the new venue\u2019s snack-driven menu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nP&V has operated a wine bar \u2013 to differing degrees \u2013 out of the wine shop and cute courtyard behind it. \u201cWhen P&V first opened, it was just cheese and charcuterie,\u201d Hill said of its food menu. Then there were outside chef collaborations, \u201cand we always did bits and bobs\u201d. L\u2019Avant Cave\u2019s opening menu taps the French wine bar pitch. Pigeon liver Melba toast is on a line-up that sweeps garlic snails, pork and Armagnac p\u00e2te with duck fat toast, and trout rillettes. Crumbed scallop with sauce gribiche. Supplied \u201cIt\u2019s a wine bar, but we want people to be able to eat with one hand,\u201d Bennie said of the food brief that he and business partner Louise Dowling gave the Porcine team. Hill obliged with a croque monsieur on toasted brioche. The collaboration will also expand Porcine\u2019s \u201cwhole beast\u201d approach in the kitchen. Hill explained they will cook different cuts of pork upstairs in the restaurant and use the neck and shoulder for the terrine at L\u2019Avant Cave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a week when Potts Point piano bar The Hook announced it would close its doors on Sunday, March 23, Bennie said the rapidly expanding Sydney bar market is not only competitive, but experiencing the sort of cost-of-living pressures felt across the economy. People are still going out, but average spend is down about 30 per cent, Bennie said. \u201cI think people want a distinct experience. There have been a lot of bars emerging,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a \u2018differential advantage\u2019, to use [business] gobbledygook.\u201d Photo: Supplied P&V\u2019s competitive advantage is its extensive range of wines, and its bottleshop-wine bar pitch, where you can grab a bottle of wine from the shelf or fridge. Diners do the same at Porcine. Hill joked that his customers have to pass through the P&V \u201cgift shop\u201d before they have a chance to look at the Porcine wine list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile corkage may seem a tad steep ($25 a bottle at P&V and L\u2019Avant Cave, and $35 a bottle at Porcine), Bennie said the system offered relatively good value. \u201cA bottle of wine you\u2019d normally pay around $200 for in a restaurant is only $125 at L\u2019Avant Cave,\u201d Bennie said. \u201cIt\u2019s our first full collaboration with Porcine. We want to sophisticate it up a bit \u2013 we think that\u2019s what Paddington\u2019s about.\u201d Open dinner Thu; lunch and dinner Fri-Sun 268 Oxford Street, Paddington, @lavant_cave\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

Got it Share\n\nWhen it comes to value for money and nutritional density, it\u2019s hard to go past tinned fish. While tuna is the most common go-to in the tinned fish aisle, there is much to be said for a number of other options including sardines, mussels and oysters, which all pack a serious nutrition punch. Here are the pros and cons of each and why all of us benefit from eating more tinned fish. From sardines to mussels, tinned seafood is as healthy as it is convenient. William Meppem EASY Crack open a tinny (or three): Adam Liaw\u2019s guide to arranging the hottest grazing board of the season\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuna Occupying the most space on supermarket shelves, at $2-$3 per 20g of high-quality protein, tuna is certainly one of the most nutrient-rich, value-for-money foods you can add to your diet. A quick scan of popular brands will reveal that the average tin of tuna contains between 55 and 75 per cent tuna, with oil, other flavours or even pasta and rice added to some varieties to create an entire meal. Generally speaking, the higher the overall percentage of tuna, the better the nutritional profile. This means that tuna slices are often the best option nutritionally when it comes to overall amounts of protein, rather than other products with added fats and sugars from extra sauces and flavourings. Recipe collection Tinned fish dinners: 25 recipes that make the most of tinned tuna, anchovies and sardines Like many varieties of tinned fish, vegetable oils are often added to tuna. If your preference is for tuna in oil rather than spring water, seek out varieties that have olive oil rather than a blend. Also important to note is that while tuna offers some healthy omega-3 fat, it is in much lower amounts overall than tinned salmon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an environmental and sustainability perspective, the majority of mainstream tuna brands are imported from Thailand, with the exception of a couple of Australian brands including Walker\u2019s Tuna. Where possible, choose varieties that specify \u201cpole and line caught\u201d or that carry the Certified Sustainable Seafood logo. It is also crucial to remember that it is possible to eat too much tuna \u2013 at most aim to include tuna in your diet only every two to three days to ensure you do not leave yourself vulnerable to an excessive accumulation of mercury in the blood stream.

William Meppem\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEASY Adam Liaw shares the secrets to fail-safe fishcakes (and yes, tinned is totally fine) Salmon While not as popular as tuna as a daily lunch protein, tinned salmon still has plenty to offer. With an overall higher protein and omega-3 fat content than tinned tuna, tinned salmon also offers a high amount of non-dairy calcium, with an average serve offering a significant 200mg of calcium per 100g serve (if you eat the small, soft bones). The other benefit of tinned salmon over tuna is that it will deliver your entire daily requirement of omega-3 fat in a single serve. As is the case with tinned tuna, check your labels for total salmon content \u2013 the higher the better \u2013 with some pink and red salmon options containing as much as 99 per cent fish. In comparison, some flavoured varieties can contain as little as 50-60 per cent salmon overall. Also, make sure you check the sodium content of tinned salmon as it can be relatively high \u2013 ideally less than 300mg per serve of salmon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop supermarket picks Coles Pink Salmon \u2013 Premium Wild Caught\n\nWoolworths Pink Salmon Sardines are hard to fault nutritionally and make a great addition to crackers or toast.

With significantly higher levels of omega-3 fat than both tuna and salmon, sardines are one of the most cost-effective, nutrient-rich proteins we can include in the diet \u2013 if you like them! Offering more than 18-20g of protein per serve along with more than 1g of natural anti-inflammatory omega-3s EPA/DHA, and close to 300mg of calcium, sardines are hard to fault nutritionally and make a great addition to crackers or toast. The majority of brands contain roughly 70 per cent sardines, along with added water, oil or salt. In general, most are a good option, especially if the oil is olive oil.

They are also surprisingly low in salt for a smoked food. The key is to opt for products in spring water rather than oil, as supermarket options are generally in less healthy blended vegetable oils, and marinated and flavoured varieties tend to have extra fats and sugars.

Not as common a seafood choice in Australia as in colder climates, mackerel can be used in the same way as other types of tinned fish and added to sandwiches, salads, crackers, sushi or pasta dishes for a protein and omega-3 boost. The better options offer a higher proportion of mackerel, or more than 70 per cent fish.

    "text": "Galvin is managed by Isaac Moses. He\u2019ll drive the hardest of hard bargains. Mitch Moses is also managed by Isaac, who is his uncle. Moses has signed for life at Parramatta and needs a halves partner now that Brown is leaving, which also means his cash is available in their cap. The Eels are in a dire situation and Galvin, a Parramatta junior, would be a natural fit to play alongside Moses. Galvin helped the Tigers to an impressive victory over the Dolphins on Saturday. Credit: Getty Images Over at Manly, Daly Cherry-Evans is, at 36, nearing the end of his career. His groundbreaking ten-year contract is over at the completion of this season. With Galvin available in 2027, the Sea Eagles might fancy their chances of signing another ten-year-half. Manly coach Anthony Seibold is another managed by Isaac Moses.\n\nThen there\u2019s another desperate club, St George Illawarra \u2013 whose coach, Shane Flanagan, is yet another Moses client. Judging by the way Flanagan has been talking in public recently, he too might be needing a long-term halfback solution. Currently, his son Kyle is the Dragons\u2019 five-eighth, and Lachie Ilias the halfback. But Flanagan raised eyebrows throughout the game when he publicly threw Ilias under the bus following the Dragons\u2019 25-24 capitulation to the Rabbitohs in round two. Asked about his No.7\u2019s display, a grumpy Flanagan told reporters, \u201cYou can make your own assessment.\u201d The Dragons recruited Ilias in the off-season after Flanagan\u2019s relationship with the Dragons\u2019 last halfback, Ben Hunt, fell to pieces. In Ilias, he and the club knew they were taking on a player whose confidence needed rebuilding after a turbulent time at his previous club. Having been tipped by former Souths coach Jason Demetriou to become \u201cthe best halfback the club has had in a long time\u201d, Ilias was dropped to reserve grade early last season and snapped his leg in two playing NSW Cup.\n\nFlanagan picked up the phone to Ilias the following day to personally apologise, but the damage was done. Ilias\u2019s agent, Braith Anasta, rightly summed it up when he said Flanagan had now put a target on Ilias\u2019s back. No one likes a public bake, especially one laced with anger, and a promising young half might now be wary of Flanagan\u2019s short fuse. Lachlan Ilias had an ordinary afternoon against the Rabbitohs, but did it warrant the treatment from his coach? Credit: NRL Photos Galvin would be a good fit for the Roosters alongside Sam Walker, provided Walker recovers from his second knee reconstruction. However, the Roosters dislike Isaac Moses and won\u2019t deal with him. Then there\u2019s Galvin\u2019s current club, the Wests Tigers. With Jarome Luai on the books on a five-year, $6m deal, they can\u2019t afford to lose his potential long-term halves partner.\n\nEspecially with Luai having an exit clause after next year, which means he\u2019s effectively on a two-year deal. CEO Shane Richardson might have to go all Godfather and make Galvin \u201can offer he can\u2019t refuse\u201d if the club wants him off the market before other clubs can talk to him. The new television deal ARL Chairman Peter V\u2019Landys wants done in the next few months looms as Richardson\u2019s biggest problem. Rather than lock in long-term deals for their clients, every manager in the game will sit back and wait to see what the rights package looks like. The current deal, which was worth about $2 billion over five years, runs to the end of the 2027 season.\n\nLoading The NRL has begun its public campaign to soften up potential suitors. There talk of a $3 billion target over five years, with the 50 per cent increase to be driven by the possibility global players such as Netflix, Paramount+, Disney and Amazon Prime might be in the mix to challenge Fox Sports\u2019 hold on pay TV rights. By then, Fox Sports will be owned by global sports brand Dazn, which takes over from Foxtel (News Corporation) as new owner on July 1. Dazn simply has to throw money at, and keep, the NRL rights \u2013 otherwise it will be a bit-part player on the Australian eastern seaboard. In the free-to-air space, Nine, the publisher of this masthead, and Seven are the two most likely candidates, and there\u2019s the possibility of splitting finals matches and State of Origin from the home and away season to maximise revenue.",

But we can only do that through investment, and wise spending of the money we're putting in. Headspace was something I was very passionate about as health minister, I want to make sure we can get more access for more patients.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing, 26% of people aged 16-24 in 2020-22 experienced high or very high psychological distress.\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's military donation has stalled at a logistics hub in Poland, as a result of the United States suspension of military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations at the logistic hub were paused after U-S President Donald Trump froze assistance to Ukraine, leading to delay and possible complications for Australia's Abram tanks getting to the Ukrainian force.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Minister for Veterans' Affairs Matt Keogh [[kee-o]] says Australia is aware of the situation, and they are working on coordination for the delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the flow of the military assistance into Ukraine is being done in a coordinated way with European partners and of course, with Ukraine, about how that flow needs to be managed. And it's important that we don't telegraph publicly (make public) how all of that timing unfolds. We will continue to work responsibly and responsively with Ukraine in provision of support, understanding the circumstances they are facing because of the illegal invasion by Russia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says over 36,000 public servants would be laid off as part of cost savings, if it wins the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition finance spokesperson Jane Hume says the lay-offs would not be made from frontline services, but didn't detail which services would be targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has criticised Labor for expanding the public service workforce while cutting costs on consultants.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Labor has defended current work-from-home entitlements, saying it saves people $5,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition previously stated it would ban the working from home policy if it wins the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdom government has launched an investigation into an electrical substation fire that led to a temporary closure of London's Heathrow Airport on Friday [[March 21]].\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 1,300 flights were cancelled with more than 200,000 people stranded at the airport due to the closure.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations resumed on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief executive Thomas Woldbye says he's proud of the airport's response to the incident, but aviation trade organisations are questioning the airport's dependence on a single power source.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Airport has also ordered an internal review into the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in sports...\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has secured another two medals at the World Athletics Indoor Championships in China on Saturday [[March 22]].\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle and long distance Olympian Jess Hull and fellow runner Ky Robinson both finished on the podium for the 3,000-metre race.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two medals came after Lachlan Kennedy won silver in the men's 60 sprint on Friday [[March 23]].\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia hopes to secure more medals in the women's 4 x 400 relay, and also with middle distance runner, Georgia Griffith's participation in the women's 1500 metres.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Treasurer, thanks for joining SBS.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Thanks, Anna\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: $150 energy rebates. How did you arrive at that number? And according to people who've already been speaking on the streets of Australia this morning, they've found it fairly underwhelming in terms of how much it costs to do their grocery shop every week. Why $150?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: This is a bit more hip pocket help for households. It recognizes that even with all of the progress we've made together as Australians on inflation, that people are still under pressure. And so it's providing more help with electricity bills for another six months, taking $150 off those electricity bills, recognizing the pressure that people are talking about in communities around Australia and feeling in communities right around Australia. My message for them would be that it's not the only thing we're doing to help with the cost of living. We've got the tax cuts rolling out, we've got cheaper medicines, we're cutting student debt, we're strengthening Medicare, because more bulk milling means less pressure on families. It's one of a number of ways that we're easing the cost of living because we know that that's still a big pressure on household budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: You haven't met that $275 cut to energy bill promise. So what do you say to voters that are now increasingly distrustful about election promises?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we cut electricity bills by $300 last year compared to what they would have otherwise been. The official inflation numbers show that electricity bills came off by 25% last year, and that's mostly, but not entirely, because of our efforts to help people with the cost of living by providing these energy bill rebates. So we're providing this help, this hip pocket help for households in the form of energy bill rebates at the same time as we add more cleaner and cheaper, more reliable energy to the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: One of the other big pressures on families is childcare. You have made changes, but will Australians see universal free childcare in a second Labor term of government?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, this budget will budget for two very big and very substantial steps towards universality when it comes to early childhood education, building more early childhood education centres, particularly in areas where there is a shortage, and particularly for nonprofit providers, as well as our three day guarantee, which is all about getting the system closer to universality. The Prime Minister, the ministers, myself, the whole government, big enthusiasts for early childhood education. It's a game changer for families and for children and for the national economy, because it makes it easier for people to work more and earn more if they want to, and it gives our kids the best start in life. That's why we're investing billions of dollars in the three day guarantee in new childcare centres as well. Getting closer and closer to universality\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Is the second term universal childcare plan a possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, I'm focused on the government's fourth budget, not a fifth budget, if we get the opportunity to deliver one. We've said that universality is our objective. That's our aspiration, and in a number of budgets. Now, really most of our budgets, we've taken very big steps towards making early childhood education cheaper. Now, building more centres, the three day guarantee. All of these things are the necessary prerequisites for universality, and that's why we're investing in them in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Can I ask you about tariffs? Could the iron or trade with China end up being under threat here? We know the US has spoken to previous Australian governments about this issue. How realistic Do you think that is as a potential problem? Is it forecast for in the budget?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, it remains to be seen whether the Americans go down that path. Obviously, we'll get more clarity in the coming days and weeks about new policies coming from the newish administration in the United States. More broadly, the uncertainty in the global economy and these escalating trade tensions are casting a dark shadow over the global economy and over our budget. One of the reasons why our budget, which is primarily about the cost of living, is also about investing in building our future and making our economy more resilient is because we are in a new world of uncertainty and unpredictability, and that's just one example.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: When it comes to the potential hole left by the US potentially pulling out of foreign aid in the Pacific. Is this budget going to put money in at least as a contingency to fill that breach?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we're already investing in our region, and in my portfolio, for example, we've done a lot of work when it comes to Pacific banking, recognizing the economic challenges and also the security challenge challenges in our amongst our nearest neighbours, and so we've been engaging with enthusiasm in a considered and a methodical way. People shouldn't expect a big increase in the aid budget on Tuesday night, but they can expect us to continue to engage in the Pacific and beyond in the service of our national and economic interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: What about the fraying of social cohesion in our own country? How will this budget address that? What extra funding will you put in place?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we made it clear over the course of recent months and over the past year or so that we're making more investments in combating a division in our society, making our society more cohesive at a really challenging time. We shouldn't pretend that there aren't opportunities for people who want to divide our community. And so we've announced already a number of important investments in keeping people safe and trying to keep our community as united as we can be, people will see that in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Got a few questions here from our readers that I wanted to put to you. Firstly, in relation to carers, a question came through asking, Why have carers been let down time and time again as their financial security is eroded. What do you say to that?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, first of all, I think from memory, whether it was the last budget or the budget before we took some steps when it comes to carers, and I understand carers being as important as they are in our communities and in our country, that we should always be looking to do the best we can buy them. I'd also say that so much of what, of our cost of living agenda, has been informed by and guided by people who need us the most. You know, whether it's the changes to payments, whether it's the rent assistance, whether it's the getting wages moving again, whether it's the cheaper medicines, is a big part of the story for carers, I know whether it's strengthening Medicare. All of these things together are about recognizing that people are under pressure, including carers, and doing what we responsibly can to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: What's in this budget for pensioners?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, a lot of the cost of living help is motivated by the pressure that pensioners are under. If you think about that, the obviously, the indexation is automatic. But in addition to that, so much of our health agenda is driven by getting out of pocket health costs down. I spend a lot of time with the pensioners, particularly the age pensioners in my local community, and I know that out of pocket health costs are a huge part of the pressure that they're under. And so strengthening Medicare, the way that we froze the PBS at $7.70 in addition to what else we're doing in the PBS system, all of that is about recognizing that pressure and doing something about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: The coalition has this morning, foreshadowed significantly shrinking the money being spent on the NDIS. Do you need to match that?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: No, and that was a new half announcement made by the coalition today, and what we know is that they make these announcements on the run, and then they typically don't come clean on what that means for Australians with a disability. We've got investment in the NDIS to a more sustainable level. It was up near 14% growth now about 8% they're now talking about something between two and 3% they need to come clean to Australians with a disability about what that means for the services that they need and deserve, and more broadly, while they're at it, this week is the perfect opportunity for them to come clean on the $600 billion in cuts that they will need to find to fund their nuclear reactors, what that means For Medicare and pensions and payments and the NDIS and veterans, they have left it far too long to come clean on that.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: It's widely accepted that the interest rate increases hurt the poorest, hardest and first. Why didn't your government do more with the levers at your disposal to help them?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: I don't think any objective observer of this government could conclude anything other than we have in each of our four budgets now provided as much responsible cost of living relief as we can. We permanently increase working age payments, including jobseeker we've strengthened Medicare. We've made early education cheaper. We've provided two rounds of rent assistance. We've got wages moving again, starting with the minimum wage and industries dominated by women. These are all the tax cuts. We rewrote the tax cuts so that 3 million Australians on low and middle incomes didn't miss out. So this has been our motivation to help people who need help. We know that cost of living pressures are front of mind for people, and that's why cost of living is front and centre in this budget like it was in the first three.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Economist Chris Richardson says much of our spending is stupid. Much of our taxing is terrible. Ken Henry, who's also been active in this space in his discussions, has also talked about acts of wilful bastardry around the way wealth inequality exists in our country. What do you look back on this term and your time as treasurer and wish you could have done more to address those big issues?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, first of all, I mean, I respect those guys that they're not always right, but I always listen to them respectfully. Chris Richardson is more or less a permanent critic of governments. His job is to get his name in the paper. My job is to make it all add up when it comes to the comments that Ken Henry has made. I worked closely with Ken, I think the world of Ken Henry and the challenge that he is describing is really the challenge I was responding to when we took that big political risk to rewrite the tax cuts so that young people got a tax cut. It's the motivation behind what we're doing in student debt, what we're doing in housing, what we're doing in fee free TAFE. All of these things are about recognizing that the pressures in our economy and in our society do fall disproportionately. That's why there's been a focus on the most vulnerable. That's why there's been a focus on young people in particular, and so I will stack up my record on helping young people with the tax cuts and housing and education and all of these ways against our predecessors, because this is a government that cares about young people. We care deeply about the intergenerational disadvantage in our country. And as treasurer, I've made it a priority as treasurer in a second term.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: If that does happen, will those big questions around the structural nature of our tax system have to be addressed?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we're not proposing new changes to the tax system beyond what we've already announced when it comes to raising additional revenue. We've got the PRRT changes through. We still want to get the superannuation changes through we've made changes in multinational tax with reforming income taxes. So in terms of revenue raises, we're not taking to the election a new raft of that. There'll be some additional measures in the budget around compliance and the like, as you would expect, the issue that Ken is identifying when it comes to the generational disadvantage, and particularly as it relates to young people, we have got a very substantial agenda there, and I've run through it, taken the opportunity to run through it today, but the tax cuts, the student debt relief, the issues in housing and education, all of these things are motivated by the challenge that Ken rightly identifies.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Finally, Treasurer, when we see the budget on Tuesday, will we see a net overseas migration number which suggests Labor is the party of a big Australia?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: You'll see the net overseas migration forecasts will be updated. We got a number for net overseas migration, I think, last week, or certainly in the last couple of weeks, and it showed that we were 10,000 lower than what we had anticipated. We're managing net overseas migration down in a responsible and a considered and a methodical way. There are always swings and roundabouts in the forecast. It's not just about how many people are arriving, but also how many people are leaving Australia, departing Australia. And so there'll be some some modest changes to the net overseas migration forecast. You'll see them on Tuesday,\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: And any changes to visa costs, we know in the past, we've seen visas be a kind of easy area for treasurers to reap in some more revenue. Is that coming this time around?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, what we've tried to do is we've tried to make sure that the cost of visas reflect our efforts to try and get through the backlog. I think you and I have spoken about this on a number of occasions. One of the big challenges that we had in the budget and in the public service was we had this huge backlog. And so from time to time, we've changed visa charges to help fund the efforts that we've made there to get the backlog down. Not prepared to foreshadow or flag any more steps in that direction, but what we've shown is a willingness to manage the visa system in a responsible way to try and get the backlog down to more manageable levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Well we thank you very much for your time, speak to you on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Thanks very much, Anna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The federal opposition has clarified it has no policy to cut spending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme after Treasurer Jim Chalmers urged the coalition to \"come clean\" on its plans for the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume said spending on the scheme had \"run out of control\" and suggested the party could look to tighten its growth if it won government.\n\n\n\n\"The NDIS, for instance, is one of those areas in the budget that has run out of control; it was growing at 14 per cent per annum,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been brought back to around eight per cent \u2026 but it's been brought under control somewhat. We think that there's more that can be done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if the Coalition had a target in mind for NDIS growth levels, she said: \"The most important thing \u2026 is in the long term that all government spending doesn't grow faster than the economy itself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume on Sunday said spending on the NDIS had \"run out of control\". Source: AAP / aap The nation's economy is forecast to grow by 2-3 per cent each year over the next four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, a report from the NDIA \u2014 the body that administers the NDIS \u2014 found the scheme was on track to meet the target of eight per cent spending growth in the four years to 2028, set by former NDIS minister Bill Shorten.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with SBS News ahead of the federal budget on Tuesday , Chalmers said Labor would not match any proposed cuts.\n\n\n\nHe said the Opposition should clarify its plans for the NDIS and how it would affect Australians with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They make these announcements on the run, and then they typically don't come clean on what that means for Australians with a disability,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They need to come clean to Australians with a disability about what that means for the services that they need and deserve.\"\n\n\n\nLater on Sunday, a spokesperson for Senator Hume said she was speaking about government spending as a whole, not the NDIS specifically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The opposition does not have a policy to reduce NDIS spending in line with economic growth, and is not advocating cutting NDIS spending to 2 to 3 per cent,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to SBS News.\n\n\n\nLabor says $5000 cost to return to office\n\nThe coalition has also attacked public servants for working from home too much, saying they would force workers back to the office.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor estimates transport and parking would cost workers about $5000 a year if they had to return to the office five days a week, up from three.\n\n\n\nThe cost is based on estimates people would spend an extra two hours a week in the car, or just under 100 extra hours a year, with commuters driving an average of just over an hour in the car to get to and from work.\n\n\n\nNew era of 'global economic uncertainty'\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, the treasurer also discussed new international challenges to Australia's economy, and said Australians shouldn't expect a \"big increase\" in foreign aid .\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers said Australia would be getting more clarity about trade policies from its major trading partner the United States, as 25 per cent tariffs on Australian aluminium and steel are set to take force on 2 April , and said the world had entered a new era of uncertainty.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the potential for the US President to zero in on Australia's highly lucrative iron ore exports to China the Treasurer said: \"it remains to be seen whether the Americans go down that path\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe played down the likelihood of Australia filling the huge gap in global aid made by Donald Trump's decision to slash US aid programs.\n\n\n\nCost of living relief to help vulnerable\n\nChalmers said support for young people and others struggling with cost-of-living relief would be prioritised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that cost of living pressures are front of mind for people, and that's why cost of living is front and centre in this budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the budget would recognise \"the pressures in our economy and in our society do fall disproportionately\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Are international students to blame for the housing crisis?\n\n\"That's why there's been a focus on the most vulnerable,\" Chalmers added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government on Sunday announced every household would receive $150 rebates on their electricity bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition will support the new rebate but pledged to bring down power prices without government subsidies, with the election to be fought largely on cost of living pressures.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "International students have faced blame from both sides of politics for ostensibly contributing to rising housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in May 2024 that increased numbers of foreign students \"puts pressure on prices and rents\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same month, Victorian Liberal Senator Jane Hume told Sky News that they put \"exceptional pressure\" on housing markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a new study has found they are \"not the culprits of the rental crisis in Australia\" and its authors \"reject the assumption that the growth of international students 'caused' or exacerbated the housing crisis in Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"International students only constituted a small part of the puzzle of the rental crisis in Australian capital cities,\" the University of South Australia research paper read.\n\n\n\n'There's really no pattern'\n\nLead researcher Michael Mu told SBS News his team looked at several different variables, including international student numbers, rental vacancy rates, inflation rates, and rental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main message here is, because the correlations between the international [students] numbers and the rental costs are random, there's really no pattern,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't have evidence that international students make finding housing harder for everyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research also showed that, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were lifted, an increase of 10,000 international students led to corresponding decrease of $1 in weekly rents when \"rental inflation was controlled and rental vacancy rate was considered\".\n\n\n\nHu said \"very complicated macro-level socio-economic reasons\" were what was truly behind the housing crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[International students] are not the main competitors in the market, and actually, when some of them do choose to go to the private rental market, they are very vulnerable,\" he explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That perhaps helps to explain why we found really no statistical relationship between international members and the housing crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers examined data from government departments and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) over 70 time points between 2017 and 2024.\n\n\n\nInternational students are at a disadvantage in renting\n\nThe newest findings align with 2024 research from the Student Accommodation Council that also found international students weren't to blame for rising prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational students make up just six per cent of renters nationally, were concentrated in capital cities, and almost 40 per cent of them live in student housing, the council's research found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do have a rental crisis in Australia, and it's a long and systemic problem made up of a number of different factors, but to unfairly place the blame solely at the feet of international students is wrong,\" Tori Brown, the executive director of the Student Accommodation Council, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown also said that the organisation's research showed that international students were disadvantaged when competing in the private rental market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"International students have no previous rental history living in Australia, and they usually don't have jobs or income statements when they're putting in for leases.\"\n\n\n\nA 'tariff' on international students?\n\nMeanwhile, government efforts to reduce the number of international students studying in Australia appear to have had some effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the ABS, there were nearly 81,000 international student arrivals in January \u2014 2.5 per cent less than the same time last year and 10 per cent less than pre-COVID-19 numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the government tried to cap international student numbers and suggested limiting international student enrolments to 270,000 by 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan was scrapped after failing to win support from Opposition, Greens and independent senators .\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, the government introduced a new policy to slow visa processing and limit the number of international students a university can enrol.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was enforced through a ministerial direction rather than a bill.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Caps on international students won't just be a headache for universities\n\nThe Opposition is planning to unveil its own policy to limit the number of international students, with its education spokesperson Sarah Henderson saying it would consist of \"tougher, more effective caps on international students\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our approach will ensure you have long term certainty, underpinned with proper consultation, with special consideration for the regions where foreign students are integral to local economies,\" Henderson said at the Universities Australia Solutions Summit in mid-March.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts like UNSW economics professor Richard Holden warn that capping international students will \"definitely reduce GDP\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important to remember that each international student that comes to Australia not only brings in the tuition fees that they pay to the university, but they, they spend money in the rest of the economy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's why they're in a really important part of our economic success story and our export success story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the ABS, international education was Australia's fourth largest export \u2014 valued at $48 billion \u2014 in 2023. They paid $17 billion in course fees and spent $31 billion within the broader economy.\n\n\n\nThe Student Accommodation Council also opposes the cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown said that, as Australia's largest service export, international students \"can't have a tariff placed on them\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are critical to our economy and to Australia's future.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Small businesses and all households will have $150 taken off soaring electricity bills as Labor emphasises hip-pocket relief heading into a pre-election budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome $1.8 billion in energy rebates would automatically be applied to every residence and one million small businesses around the nation on a quarterly basis from 1 July under the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the second time in a year the government will roll out energy rebates after it provided $300 in relief in the 2024 budget.\n\n\n\nThe rebate would slash household bills by an average of 7.5 per cent and bring down inflation by half a per cent, according to Treasury estimates cited by the federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity prices are set to rise from mid-year, with the Australian Energy Regulator recommending a 8.9 per cent increase to the maximum amount customers can be charged in certain parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are going to take a further $150 right off your power bill because helping your family budget is our number one priority,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is another cost-of-living relief measure that my government is delivering for Australians while putting downward pressure on inflation\".\n\n\n\nThe government talked it up as immediate relief before wider electricity reforms kicked in, with the consumer watchdog's inquiry into the National Electricity Market extended by 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice comparison site Canstar Blue said with electricity prices set to rise by up to $200 a year for an average household, the limited rebate will \"fall short for many struggling families\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said data from the Australian Energy Regulator showed that more customers were falling behind on their electricity bills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s great to see the government providing cost of living relief, however, for some households with higher-than-average energy bills this might not be enough to get them through winter, particularly with electricity price rises coming down the line,\" Canstar's Sally Tindall said.\n\n\n\n'Could be more'\n\nThe announcement was met with mixed reactions on the streets of the south-eastern NSW suburb of Queanbeyan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will help, could be more - it's pretty tough out there at the moment,\" Anthony, who did not give his last name, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they really wanted to fix it, they could,\" he added, about the cost of living crisis.\n\n\n\nQueanbeyan pensioner Marty says a $150 saving on his energy bill will \"mean a lot\" for him. Credit: Ewa Staszewska Another local, Marty, said he would bank the savings as a pensioner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It means a lot to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm on the pension so things are hard all the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal budget will be handed down on Tuesday evening, with Opposition Leader Peter Dutton due to reveal his \"positive plans\" for the nation in his reply on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a much better way to manage our economy, to help families, to help small businesses grow, to help our economy thrive, to keep Australians safe,\" Dutton told reporters.\n\n\n\n\"That will be detailed in the budget in reply speech, and in other announcements that we'll make in the run-up to the election.\"\n\n\n\n",

I often liken it to photography which wasn\u2019t recognised as a legitimate art form for quite some time until it started to enter into museums and then into auction houses et cetera. I think we can see a similar, somewhat sped up trajectory for AI as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sale, titled Augmented Intelligence amassed over 1.1 million dollars [[US$700,000]], despite six of the artworks not selling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also accumulated over 6,500 signatures by artists calling to cancel the auction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an open letter to the gallery, the letter said, \u201cif you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction. Yours sincerely, the undersigned artists.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Sue Beyer, the distinction isn\u2019t so clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a multi-disciplinary artist, she says developments in AI simultaneously fascinate and repel her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using a lot of different new media and also AI. The AI, I really enjoy using because it\u2019s not perfect and I like its weaknesses. I\u2019m sort of treating like an oracle or not God, but I give the AI an instruction, or prompt and it gives me information in return. It\u2019s like a collaborative process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Beyer is even using the technology to learn more about herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve been using it is not really offensive or scary. Nothing like Black Mirror [[dystopian television series]] or The Terminator [[sci-fi movie]] or anything like that. I\u2019m asking questions like \u2018Who am I?\u2019 and \u2018Who is Sue Beyer?\u2019. I\u2019m sort of using irony because I\u2019m looking at what it means to be human using something that obviously isn\u2019t human.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Brisbane Portrait Prize announced it was changing its entry guidelines stating, \u201cit is impractical to have a blanket ban on the use of AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, it allowed entrants to submit artworks completely generated using image creation platforms like Midjourney or DALL-E.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving criticism by parts of the artistic community, organisers reconsidered its entry requirements to only allow works partly generated using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Dennis McCart\u2019s self-portrait using reprocessed AI images took home $10,000 for the Digital Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirrunga Wiradyuri, a Wiradjuri man and Founder of Birrunga Gallery won the competition's Packer Prize in 2021 for his portrait titled Night Rainbow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis First Nations gallery boycotted the prize last year for its guidelines on AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he will not be entering the award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was really unfortunate, because I know there are some very reasonable people within that organisation. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019ve got a great deal of respect for the decisions made. It would have been very easy to go, \u2018Oh, ok. We hadn\u2019t considered that. It doesn\u2019t even have to be considered a real good point, just a reasonable point. Why don\u2019t time out on this?\u2019. Everyone would have gone \u2018Great decision, the Brisbane Portrait Prize listens to Blackfellas.\u2019 Instead, what we\u2019ve got is we\u2019re pressing on regardless because we\u2019ve got experts who say its harmless. I don\u2019t get it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri believes it\u2019s not the change he opposed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, he says he\u2019s in favour of controversy and challenging messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about censoring, I\u2019m not about that at all. I just feel as though at a minimum you should not do harm and at the moment, I can see this doing harm. So, there\u2019s this reckless notion that it\u2019s ok to harvest and reproduce First Nations artwork. The ramifications for that are next level cultural appropriation, cultural theft, it\u2019s colonisation, it\u2019s disenfranchisement, it\u2019s diminishing, it\u2019s diluting, it\u2019s invisible-ing us again, another level of invisible-ing us. I mean, that all adds up to false representation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says cultural appropriation and stereotypical perceptions of First Nations art is a reality he still confronts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his galleries Cultural Creative Development Program, he provides professional exposure for emerging Aboriginal and Torres Strait artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means creating artworks for businesses' Reconciliation Action Plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says he still gets asked for traditional dot painting art.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a style derived from the Central and Western Desert regions of Australia - but not Wiradjuri in New South Wales, where he is from.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Louise Buckingham is the CEO of Arts Law Centre Australia, which provides specialised legal support to First Nations creators through its Artists in the Black service.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says with the rise of AI, cultural flattening and fake Indigenous art is rife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of how important the Indigenous art market is and also how extensive the market for fake souvenirs and fake art has been alongside of that and the damage it does to our existing art market. You know, one set of stakeholders is benefiting to a greater extent than ever in the context and history of the technology boom and one group is losing out to a greater extent than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Stock, a graphics software that provides royalty free photos and graphics, has faced scrutiny by the National Indigenous Times for its representations of First Nations art and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search of \u2018Indigenous Australian\u2019 brings up images of people with generic body markings or wearing Native American feather headdresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople wearing business suits on the platform are quote \u201crepresenting workplace diversity\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search for \u2018Indigenous Australian art\u2019 surfaces images of didgeridoos and boomerangs, AI rock and dot style paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extended licence for each of these AI images costs nearly 90 dollars on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Australia\u2019s current legislation, copyright for artistic works generally last the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says while this may seem like an extensive period, for First Nations communities whose art and culture moves across past, present and future, it can raise issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of AI-generated art, it gets more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, copyright law does not subsist or exist for artificial intelligence, as legally, there is considered to be no human authorship or originality to protect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also means that concerns over how AI models are being trained using artists' works are difficult to legislate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe responses to things like the Christie\u2019s auction which received a lot more in sales than people anticipated, but it also elicited a response from creators who were outraged that the notion of an auction for this kind of artwork. You know, there have been other responses from all around the world from creators of all descriptions and when we are talking about visual art, and we have class action complaints in the US that we will be watching very closely here in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA working group on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property was established in December last year, to protect First Nations knowledge amidst the rise of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says consultation from the working group has already been paused until after the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, The University of Chicago has developed tools like Nightshade or Glaze, which are being used by artists to fight back against AI data scraping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tools transform data from images into \u201cpoison\u201d, so that AI training on them without consent learn unpredictable behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this software, the university says a prompt that asks for an image of a cow flying in space might instead get an image of a handbag in space.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pfefferkorn from the Art, AI and Digital Ethics centre believes while AI is new, artists have been balancing the relationship between ethics, technology and science for centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really hopeful the more we engage critically and with the different complexities that are being presented and already have been explored by artists in this space for such a long time, the more we\u2019ll be able to push back and reclaim some of our agency because we will be able to see there are alternatives and other options.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The dish: Bratwurst, Germany\n\nOne sausage to rule them all: German bratwurst. Credit: iStock\n\nPlate up Let\u2019s talk about the world\u2019s best sausages. You have to include Spanish chorizo, which is obviously excellent. And don\u2019t forget botifarra, the chorizo\u2019s Catalan cousin. Then we can mention South Africa\u2019s rough, hearty boerewors. North African merguez gets a shout. Argentinian-style chorizo is great. Thai-Lao sai oua is amazing. And it\u2019s hard to top English Cumberland, or French Toulouse.\n\nBut the true greatest, the sausage to rule them all? It has to be a German bratwurst. They\u2019re just so good: tender, flavourful, umami-rich, and crying out for a slather of mustard, a side of sauerkraut, and a gigantic glass of cold beer. Though there are multiple local variations of bratwurst in Germany, for the most part, these sausages are made with pork meat, which is ground and mixed with marjoram, along with mace, coriander and other spices, stuffed into sausage casing and then \u2013 ideally \u2013 cooked over coals.\n\nFirst serve There\u2019s evidence that sausages were being made in what is now Germany as far back as Celtic times, in the third or fourth century BC. The first recorded mention of a bratwurst, however, was in 1313, in the city of Nuremberg. During the 15th century the craze really kicked off, with local versions appearing in Thuringia, Coburg, and St Gallen in Switzerland. In 1567, the official recipe for Nuernberger bratwurst was settled upon \u2013 these uber-popular snags are small and thin, and are typically served (to this day) with three in a bun, topped with mustard.",

Got it Share\n\nAfter spending the past four years under the same roof on Oxford Street in Paddington, two of Sydney\u2019s hottest hospitality venues are combining their talents to open a wine bar. Chef\u2019s hatted bistro Porcine, known for its \u201cwhole beast\u201d approach to cooking meat, and its downstairs neighbour, P&V Merchants, a bottleshop selling natural and independent wines, will open L\u2019Avant Cave this week in the rear courtyard of the terrace on the ground level. Pigeon liver Melba toast will be one of the snacks on the menu at L\u2019Avant Cave. Supplied The two have dabbled before, with Porcine supplying a terrine here and there to P&V, but the flatmates are now all-in on the joint venture. \u201cWe\u2019re off the sofa and into the bedroom,\u201d Porcine chef Nicholas Hill joked about the professional partnership. L\u2019Avant Cave opens on Friday, March 28, inspired by wine bars in France such as P&V co-owner Mike Bennie\u2019s Parisian favourite, L\u2019Avant Comptoir, in the 6th arrondissement. Hill has his own Parisian influences, including wine bars with great food but \u201cno knives and forks\u201d \u2013 inspiration for the new venue\u2019s snack-driven menu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nP&V has operated a wine bar \u2013 to differing degrees \u2013 out of the wine shop and cute courtyard behind it. \u201cWhen P&V first opened, it was just cheese and charcuterie,\u201d Hill said of its food menu. Then there were outside chef collaborations, \u201cand we always did bits and bobs\u201d. L\u2019Avant Cave\u2019s opening menu taps the French wine bar pitch. Pigeon liver Melba toast is on a line-up that sweeps garlic snails, pork and Armagnac p\u00e2te with duck fat toast, and trout rillettes. Crumbed scallop with sauce gribiche. Supplied \u201cIt\u2019s a wine bar, but we want people to be able to eat with one hand,\u201d Bennie said of the food brief that he and business partner Louise Dowling gave the Porcine team. Hill obliged with a croque monsieur on toasted brioche. The collaboration will also expand Porcine\u2019s \u201cwhole beast\u201d approach in the kitchen. Hill explained they will cook different cuts of pork upstairs in the restaurant and use the neck and shoulder for the terrine at L\u2019Avant Cave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a week when Potts Point piano bar The Hook announced it would close its doors on Sunday, March 23, Bennie said the rapidly expanding Sydney bar market is not only competitive, but experiencing the sort of cost-of-living pressures felt across the economy. People are still going out, but average spend is down about 30 per cent, Bennie said. \u201cI think people want a distinct experience. There have been a lot of bars emerging,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a \u2018differential advantage\u2019, to use [business] gobbledygook.\u201d Photo: Supplied P&V\u2019s competitive advantage is its extensive range of wines, and its bottleshop-wine bar pitch, where you can grab a bottle of wine from the shelf or fridge. Diners do the same at Porcine. Hill joked that his customers have to pass through the P&V \u201cgift shop\u201d before they have a chance to look at the Porcine wine list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile corkage may seem a tad steep ($25 a bottle at P&V and L\u2019Avant Cave, and $35 a bottle at Porcine), Bennie said the system offered relatively good value. \u201cA bottle of wine you\u2019d normally pay around $200 for in a restaurant is only $125 at L\u2019Avant Cave,\u201d Bennie said. \u201cIt\u2019s our first full collaboration with Porcine. We want to sophisticate it up a bit \u2013 we think that\u2019s what Paddington\u2019s about.\u201d Open dinner Thu; lunch and dinner Fri-Sun 268 Oxford Street, Paddington, @lavant_cave\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

Got it Share\n\nWhen it comes to value for money and nutritional density, it\u2019s hard to go past tinned fish. While tuna is the most common go-to in the tinned fish aisle, there is much to be said for a number of other options including sardines, mussels and oysters, which all pack a serious nutrition punch. Here are the pros and cons of each and why all of us benefit from eating more tinned fish. From sardines to mussels, tinned seafood is as healthy as it is convenient. William Meppem EASY Crack open a tinny (or three): Adam Liaw\u2019s guide to arranging the hottest grazing board of the season\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuna Occupying the most space on supermarket shelves, at $2-$3 per 20g of high-quality protein, tuna is certainly one of the most nutrient-rich, value-for-money foods you can add to your diet. A quick scan of popular brands will reveal that the average tin of tuna contains between 55 and 75 per cent tuna, with oil, other flavours or even pasta and rice added to some varieties to create an entire meal. Generally speaking, the higher the overall percentage of tuna, the better the nutritional profile. This means that tuna slices are often the best option nutritionally when it comes to overall amounts of protein, rather than other products with added fats and sugars from extra sauces and flavourings. Recipe collection Tinned fish dinners: 25 recipes that make the most of tinned tuna, anchovies and sardines Like many varieties of tinned fish, vegetable oils are often added to tuna. If your preference is for tuna in oil rather than spring water, seek out varieties that have olive oil rather than a blend. Also important to note is that while tuna offers some healthy omega-3 fat, it is in much lower amounts overall than tinned salmon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an environmental and sustainability perspective, the majority of mainstream tuna brands are imported from Thailand, with the exception of a couple of Australian brands including Walker\u2019s Tuna. Where possible, choose varieties that specify \u201cpole and line caught\u201d or that carry the Certified Sustainable Seafood logo. It is also crucial to remember that it is possible to eat too much tuna \u2013 at most aim to include tuna in your diet only every two to three days to ensure you do not leave yourself vulnerable to an excessive accumulation of mercury in the blood stream.

William Meppem\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEASY Adam Liaw shares the secrets to fail-safe fishcakes (and yes, tinned is totally fine) Salmon While not as popular as tuna as a daily lunch protein, tinned salmon still has plenty to offer. With an overall higher protein and omega-3 fat content than tinned tuna, tinned salmon also offers a high amount of non-dairy calcium, with an average serve offering a significant 200mg of calcium per 100g serve (if you eat the small, soft bones). The other benefit of tinned salmon over tuna is that it will deliver your entire daily requirement of omega-3 fat in a single serve. As is the case with tinned tuna, check your labels for total salmon content \u2013 the higher the better \u2013 with some pink and red salmon options containing as much as 99 per cent fish. In comparison, some flavoured varieties can contain as little as 50-60 per cent salmon overall. Also, make sure you check the sodium content of tinned salmon as it can be relatively high \u2013 ideally less than 300mg per serve of salmon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop supermarket picks Coles Pink Salmon \u2013 Premium Wild Caught\n\nWoolworths Pink Salmon Sardines are hard to fault nutritionally and make a great addition to crackers or toast.

With significantly higher levels of omega-3 fat than both tuna and salmon, sardines are one of the most cost-effective, nutrient-rich proteins we can include in the diet \u2013 if you like them! Offering more than 18-20g of protein per serve along with more than 1g of natural anti-inflammatory omega-3s EPA/DHA, and close to 300mg of calcium, sardines are hard to fault nutritionally and make a great addition to crackers or toast. The majority of brands contain roughly 70 per cent sardines, along with added water, oil or salt. In general, most are a good option, especially if the oil is olive oil.

They are also surprisingly low in salt for a smoked food. The key is to opt for products in spring water rather than oil, as supermarket options are generally in less healthy blended vegetable oils, and marinated and flavoured varieties tend to have extra fats and sugars.

Not as common a seafood choice in Australia as in colder climates, mackerel can be used in the same way as other types of tinned fish and added to sandwiches, salads, crackers, sushi or pasta dishes for a protein and omega-3 boost. The better options offer a higher proportion of mackerel, or more than 70 per cent fish.

According to the Travelers Diarrhea study published on the US National Library of Medicine website, diarrhoea is the most common travel-related condition, estimated to affect 40 to 60 per cent of travellers. The most common cause is the E. coli bacteria, thought to be responsible for about 30 per cent of cases, although salmonella, listeria and viruses such as the highly contagious norovirus, the scourge of cruise ships, are among other reasons for busy bowel syndrome.\n\nIn the case of a bacterial infection, the most likely causes are contaminated water, unpasteurised dairy products, undercooked meat or fish, food stored at unsafe temperatures or in an unhygienic environment.\n\nI\u2019m betting mine is viral rather than bacterial. The first to come down in my group fell sick just a few days into the trip. But only half the group is stricken with the same symptoms.

Montana Shaw, 22, was heading to an event at Sydney's International Convention & Exhibition Centre in September when her mum removed her heavy puffer jacket while seated in the vehicle.\n\nJust as they passed a roadside camera, her mum's seatbelt \"slipped under her boob\" as she twisted to take the garment off. As a result, the young driver copped a $410 penalty and three demerit points for her passenger's seatbelt not being worn correctly \u2014 an offence she worries will now impede her career.\n\n\"It was such bad timing,\" Montana told Yahoo News Australia. \"I have to detail this driving fine in job applications now... I've just completed a bachelor of law... and I'm looking to get into a government job.\"\n\nDue to the nature of her work, the applications are extensive and often ask candidates to provide details on any previous criminal activity.

Source: TikTok/Sydstreetbounty\n\nA young Aussie has proven someone's trash truly is someone else's treasure, after making an incredible $380 discovery in a pile of rubbish put out for council collection in one of the country's most affluent suburbs.\n\nSydneysider Em, who describes herself as an \"amateur treasure hunter\" had no idea how valuable the innocent-looking pen she picked up in the eastern suburb of Vaucluse would end up being.\n\n\"Nothing really drew me to it besides the fact that it was a bit heavier than a regular pen and had a base to store it in, and a bit of etching of a logo in the bottom of it,\" she told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nBut when she got it home and did some research, she learned the item she innocently picked up to decorate her desk is a designer item made by ACME Studios which retails for $380 new. The pen, which is made out of lathe spun rosewood and is gold plated, is the work of Italian designer Matteo Thun.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It really was just a bit of luck,\" she said.\n\nEm has furnished her entire house with items she's found on the kerb waiting for council collection. Source: TikTok/Sydstreetbounty\n\nThe treasure hunting trend across Aussie suburbs\n\nEm explained that after she began using a Lime Bike as her main form of transport, she \"started realising how much valuable waste is put out on Sydney's streets every day.\n\n\"At least in the inner city and inner west, there really is a culture of putting perfectly usable items out on the sidewalk with the expectation that people will rummage through it and take whatever they need,\" she said.\n\nUnfortunately, what isn't picked up will end up in landfill, she said. According to the NSW Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Sydney's landfills are set to run out of space by 2030 \u2014 putting a ticking clock on the need to increase recycling rates and divert food waste.\n\nEm started out \"paying more attention\" to online groups to find freebies, but it wasn't long before she realised people were sharing maps and dates of council collections around the city. Since the beginning of the year, Em has headed out five times to areas like Woollahra, Bellevue Hill, Watsons Bay and Vaucluse, all of which are in the top 10 wealthiest suburbs in all of Australia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It\u2019s well worth the time to go and see what these people are throwing away,\" she told Yahoo. So far, she's found pianos, barbecues, televisions, sturdy tables, working Dyson vacuum cleaners, lamps, and plants.\n\n\"I\u2019ve pretty much furnished my entire house doing this over the summer and it\u2019s been fantastic for my wallet,\" she said.\n\nTreasure hunter's tips to Aussies who want to get involved\n\nWhile Em admits \"some junk is just junk\" much of the stuff people throw out can be made new again with a clean or repair. \"A lot of people really don\u2019t know the value of what they\u2019re throwing away, but for the people willing to make the effort and glove up, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHer advice to anyone looking to get their hands dirty and sift through rubbish left on the kerb for council collection is that it's important to wear gloves and sunscreen first and foremost.\n\n\"Look in drawers (because sometimes people forget to empty them), respect the people of the suburb and don\u2019t make a mess of the street while looking through,\" she said. \"Don\u2019t worry about what time you go, there really is more than enough for everyone.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
