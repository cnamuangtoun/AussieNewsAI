    "text": "Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has made several recommendations to the Minister for Communications, Anika Wells, regarding the draft rules that will guide the upcoming ban on social media for kids under 16.\n\nThose rules are required to be formalised ahead of the ban's introduction at the end of this year, primarily so that the platforms themselves can gear up for the changes, along with the parents and kids who will be impacted.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, the Minister responsible wrote to the eSafety Commissioner seeking advice on the drafter's rules.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Iran attacks US airbase in Qatar\n\nCurrently, YouTube is called out as an exemption in the rules, something the previous Minister defended, but there's been no clear justification for the exemption. (Getty)\n\nSeven days later, the eSafety Commissioner responded with five rather comprehensive options.\n\nThe most dramatic of the options was the recommendation that \"YouTube is removed from the draft rules\".\n\nCurrently, YouTube is called out as an exemption in the rules, something the previous Minister defended, but there's been no clear justification for the exemption.\n\neSafety says: \"While YouTube has many educational and otherwise beneficial uses, eSafety is concerned that the popular use of YouTube among children, coupled with reports of exposure to harmful content and the platform's use of certain features and functionality, is not consistent with the purpose of the SMMA (Social Media Minimum Age) obligation to reduce the risk of harm.\"\n\n\"Results from eSafety's recent Youth Survey indicated YouTube was the most popular social media platform children had ever used, with 76 per cent of 10 to 15-year-olds having used YouTube, making it significantly more popular than other social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, especially among the 10 to 12-year-old cohort.\"\n\nChildren will be banned from all spocial media platforms once the law is put into effect. (Getty)\n\n\"The recommendations point out that YouTube has similar features to other platforms which are set to be banned.\"\n\n\"YouTube currently employs persuasive design features and functionality that may be associated with harms to health, including those which may contribute to unwanted or excessive use (such as infinite scroll, auto-play, qualitative social metrics, and tailored and algorithmically recommended content feeds).\"\n\n\"Separately and combined, these features may encourage excessive consumption without breaks and amplify exposure to harmful content.\"\n\nIn addition to calling out the YouTube exemption, the eSafety Commissioner suggests adding an explanatory statement to the rules to outline the Government's intentions, and amending the rules to look at the purpose of the social media service as well as the risk of harm it poses.",

    "text": "While there have been no major disruptions to the global oil supply so far, the attacks on Iran \u2014 by Israel and then the US \u2014 have rattled investors, sending oil futures soaring by about 10 per cent since the start of hostilities, among fears Iran could retaliate by disrupting shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nFrom the perspective of the global economy, there are few places as strategically important. The waterway, located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, is only 33.7 kilometres wide at its narrowest point. It's the only way to ship crude from the oil-rich Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. Iran controls its northern side.\n\nAbout 20 million barrels of oil, about one-fifth of daily global production, flow through the strait every day, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which called the channel a \"critical oil chokepoint\".\n\nREAD MORE: Iranian ambassador says US military bases could be targeted after strikes\n\nThe waterway, located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, is only 33.7 kilometres wide at its narrowest point. (CNN)\n\nOn Sunday evening, following US airstrikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, Brent crude, the global benchmark, briefly surged above $US80 ($125) per barrel, according to Refinitiv data, the first time that's happened since January. Before the conflict, prices had largely hovered between $US60 and $US75 a barrel since August 2024.\n\nBut over the course of the Asian trading day on Monday, Brent and WTI, the US benchmark, gave up their early gains. Brent last traded 0.53 per cent lower at $US76.49 per barrel, while WTI was 0.62 per cent lower at $US73.38.\n\nWhether oil prices will climb further now depends on Iran's response. Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise Capital, told CNN that a potential disruption to the Iran-controlled sea route would cause oil prices to surge toward $US100 per barrel.\n\nA prominent adviser to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has already called for the closure of the Strait.\n\nAn image from 2019 This image from 2019 shows a speedboat of Iran's Revolutionary Guard moving around the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which was seized in the Strait of Hormuz amid tensions at the time. (AP)\n\nA functioning Strait of Hormuz is \"absolutely essential\" to the health of the global economy, he said.\n\n\"Following America's attack on the Fordow nuclear installation, it is now our turn,\" warned Hossein Shariatmadari, the editor-in-chief of the hardline Kayhan newspaper, a well-known conservative voice who has previously identified himself as a \"representative\" for Khamenei.\n\nGeographic leverage over global shipping gives Iran the \"capacity to cause a shock in oil markets, drive up oil prices, drive inflation, collapse Trump's economic agenda,\" Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj news outlet, told CNN.\n\nWhen it comes to moving oil, the Strait is actually much narrower than its 33.7-kilometre official width. The navigable shipping lanes for massive supertankers are only about 3.2 kilometres wide in each direction, requiring vessels to pass through both Iranian and Omani territorial waters.\n\n\ufeffBut Vandana Hari, founder and CEO of Vanda Insights, which tracks energy markets, sees Iran's blocking of the Strait as a \"remote tail risk\". The presence of a beefed-up US naval fleet in the region is both a deterrent and a response tool, she said.\n\n\"Iran has a lot to lose and very little, if anything, to gain by attempting to close the Strait,\" Hari said. \"Iran cannot afford to turn its oil-producing neighbors, who have been neutral or even sympathetic towards the Islamic Republic as it faced Israeli and US attacks, into enemies, any more than trigger the ire of its main crude market, China.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Fears oil prices could surge in US after Iran strikes \ufeff\n\nAnother image from 2019 shows a gun of Iran's Revolutionary Guard aimed at the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which was seized in the Strait of Hormuz. (AP)\n\nA closure of the Strait would be particularly detrimental to China and other Asian economies which rely on the crude oil and natural gas shipped through the waterway. The EIA estimates that 84 per cent of the crude oil and 83 per cent of the liquefied natural gas that moved through the Strait of Hormuz last year went to Asian markets.\n\nChina, the largest buyer of Iranian oil, sourced 5.4 million barrels per day through the Strait of Hormuz in the first quarter this year, while India and South Korea imported 2.1 million and 1.7 million barrels per day, respectively, according to the EIA's estimates. In comparison, the US and Europe imported just 400,000 and 500,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the same period, according to the EIA.\n\nAt a regular Foreign Ministry press conference on Monday, China stressed the importance of the Persian Gulf and its surrounding waters for international trade, saying that maintaining security and stability in the region serves the common interests of the international community.\n\n\"China calls on the international community to step up efforts to promote de-escalation of the conflict and to prevent regional turmoil from exerting a greater impact on global economic development,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.\n\nOn Sunday, India's Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri sought to reassure jittery investors on X that the country has \"diversified\" its oil supplies in the past few years.",

    "text": "Victoria's Goulburn Valley is known as the food bowl of Australia, but it could soon be known as the home of the giant pear.\n\nA group of business leaders is advocating for a three-storey-high giant pear to be built in Shepparton to celebrate the region's proud horticultural history.\n\nSteering group chairperson and former fruit grower Rocky Varapodio said the giant pear would recognise the industry that helped shape the area in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\n\"The plan is to have an interactive display inside it, so that you know the story can be told of horticulture in our region and how important it has been,\" Mr Varapodio said.\n\nAre Australia's 'big things' still relevant? Photo shows The Big Banana at Coffs Harbour. From giant bananas to huge prawns, there are more than 150 \"big things\" scattered across Australia and, perhaps surprisingly, some small towns are still building them.\n\nWith 90 per cent of Australia's pears grown in the Goulburn Valley, the fruit was an obvious choice.\n\nEarly estimates suggest the project could cost $1.3 million, and the group is seeking government and stakeholder support to bring the idea to life.\n\n\"It's really in the preliminary design phase,\" Mr Varapodio said.\n\nA report commissioned by the group suggests the landmark could attract thousands of visitors and could potentially inject more than $2 million into the local economy annually.\n\n\"The response has been great. People we've pitched the idea to really can see the benefit of telling this story through an attraction,\" Mr Varapodio said.\n\nPowerful icons\n\nAustralia's iconic \"big things\" play a meaningful role in tourism, according to Lauren Douglass, chief executive of Australian Regional Tourism.\n\nThe Big Pineapple on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.

    "text": "Early in her pregnancy, Tara Sawyer was told the local hospital would not be able to accommodate her.\n\n\"Because of my higher BMI, you automatically have to go to Box Hill rather than Angliss Hospital,\" says the 29-year-old from Emerald/land of the Bunurong and Wurundjeri peoples in Victoria.\n\n\"Initially I was quite upset about that because I'm a teacher, I work full-time, and it meant all my appointments had to be an hour away, so I had to take a whole day off work to have an appointment.\n\n\"It led to stress in my job, which was not ideal.\"\n\nTara says she also felt ashamed to tell people why she had to travel to a different hospital.\n\n\"My husband and I talk about weight all the time, but even just to tell him I can't go to this hospital because I'm overweight, was quite embarrassing.\"\n\nPregnant women face weight discrimination Photo shows Emily Chamberlain A new initiative from a Queensland hospital hopes to bring an end to weight discrimination in maternity care.\n\nRecent research from Monash University has found reducing women's experiences of weight stigma should lead to better care and better pregnancy outcomes for larger-bodied women.\n\nIt shows larger-bodied women are sometimes automatically treated as high-risk, which the authors write is \"problematic because it focuses on body size rather than health\".\n\nBMI is a method used to sort patients by weight into four categories from underweight to obese. Its appropriateness as a measure of healthy weight for individuals has long been contested.\n\nFor Tara, the redirection to a hospital further away ended up being a \"blessing in disguise\", thanks to a program dedicated to maternity care for women with a high BMI.\n\n\"It meant that I could opt to not be weighed at each appointment, not be told about my weight, or be told only if I wanted,\" Tara says.\n\nWe spoke to Tara about her pregnancy journey, and how, for the first time, her weight meant she received more care, rather than less.\n\nThese are her words.\n\nHealth concerns were dismissed throughout my life\n\nTara says being transferred to another hospital was annoying at first, but ultimately a \"blessing in disguise\". (Supplied)\n\nI had been on a health journey for about 10 years prior to being pregnant, with what I assumed was an autoimmune disease.\n\nI really struggled to get care early on. The default response from most doctors about my symptoms was to exercise more and lose weight.\n\nI was aware of my weight, but struggled to lose any, and suspected whatever else condition I had was contributing to that.\n\nI also have anxiety, and at one point I was having some internal bleeding investigated.\n\nWhen they didn't find a cause, I had a specialist gastroenterologist tell me what it was probably just anxiety causing those symptoms.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nAfter about three years of fighting to have my voice heard, I was finally referred to a rheumatologist who has taken my condition seriously.\n\nI also found a fantastic GP who has listened to my fear of being dismissed because of my weight, and made sure unless my bloods indicated it was a problem, or I came in concerned about my weight, it would not be factored into my care and treatment.\n\nIt worked out for the best in my maternity care\n\nI actually fall into the catchment of Angliss Hospital, but due to having a suspected autoimmune condition, borderline high hypertension, and a high BMI, I was told I had to present to Box Hill and receive care there.\n\nI was quite frustrated and embarrassed I had to do that. But it did work out for the best.\n\nTara says her son's birth was a wonderful experience. (Supplied)\n\nI was told about the PEARL (Pregnancy Elevated BMI Antenatal Risk reduction and Lifestyle) program. It's run by this beautiful midwife Maddy (Madeline Hawke).\n\nShe was concerned about weight stigma with pregnancy and how many women deal with a lot of weight conversations in pregnancy that are not necessarily important to that pregnancy.\n\nI saw Maddy and the same obstetrician throughout my pregnancy.\n\nWe didn't really discuss weight. At one point I raised concerns about how much I was putting on, but I was assured it was in the normal range for women with my BMI.\n\nThere was also an honest conversation about why it's sometimes recommended women with high BMI be induced, but it was presented to me as research and fact, rather than pressure or opinion to sway me one way or the other.\n\nI kind of got the \"royal treatment\".\n\nI met another woman in the program and she said to me, \"It's like the first time that being overweight has been a positive in my life\".\n\nI felt the same way.\n\nTara says learning how to advocate for herself was a big part of her pregnancy journey. (Supplied)\n\nAdvocating for myself hasn't always been easy\n\nDespite the great care, I had such an awful pregnancy with pain and pre-natal depression.\n\nIt was a really hard time.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help: COPE 1300 740 398\n\nLifeline 13 11 14\n\nBeyond Blue 1300 22 4636\n\nBut I would give birth every day of the week. I loved it. It was such a positive experience.\n\nThe midwives and team were amazing.\n\nI put that down to all the research I did. Familiarising myself with hospital policies on what I could and couldn't push back on. Having a thorough birth plan.\n\nI learnt that I was always entitled to ask for a second opinion, and ask for a second doctor if I wasn't happy with my care.\n\nIt's your right to ask for that.\n\nAnd I know it's really hard; as women we are seen as being rude and up-front when advocating for ourselves.\n\nBut pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times in your life, you want to make sure the people in the room have your best interests at heart, and don't look down on you because of your weight.",

The federal government has been accused of making a \"sweetheart deal\" to exempt YouTube from the teen social media ban, as YouTube's competitors kick off a co-ordinated public campaign against the move.\n\n\"It's almost ubiquitous that kids are on social media. By far the most prevalent social media site they're on is YouTube,\" she said.\n\n\"And when we asked where they were experiencing harm and the kinds of harms they were experiencing, the most prevalent place where young Australians experienced harm was on YouTube \u2014 almost 37 per cent.\n\n\"This ranges from misogynistic content to hateful material, to violent fighting videos, online challenges, disordered eating, suicidal ideation.\"\n\nThe research also found 70 per cent of children had encountered harmful content online.\n\nPlatforms targeted by the ban had previously expressed their deep concerns about YouTube's exemption.\n\nMs Inman Grant has written to federal Communications Minister Anika Wells, making a formal recommendation that YouTube be captured by the ban.\n\nShe suggests in the letter both that YouTube has the characteristics of a platform that should be captured by the ban, and also that specifically carving out platforms by name could become problematic.\n\nAge assurance can be done, report says before social media ban deadline Photo shows A generic stock photo of a group of teenage school girls on their phones, wearing formal school uniforms. A company contracted by the government to assess technologies for verifying the ages of online users says it can be done privately, robustly and effectively.\n\nThe recommendation also notes that young people would still be able to access YouTube without a login, meaning some of the site's resources will still be available.\n\nA spokesperson for Ms Wells said the recommendation was being looked at.\n\n\"The minister is carefully considering the eSafety Commission's advice on the draft Social Media Minimum Age Rules,\" they said.\n\n\"Her top priority is making sure the draft rules fulfil the objective of the Act \u2014 protecting children from the harms of social media.\"\n\nCalls for clearer carve outs\n\nMs Inman Grant also wants more clarity for social media platforms seeking exemptions from the ban, arguing the current rules are too prescriptive.\n\nUnder the current draft rules, platforms can be exempt because they are messaging apps, are used for online gaming, or have the \"primary purpose of supporting the health and education of end-users\".\n\nThe draft rules go on to name YouTube separately as being exempt.\n\nIn her letter to the minister, Ms Inman Grant said a new clause should be added to broadly exempt platforms that pose little risk.\n\nAge-checking tech for social media ban mistakes kids for 37-year-olds Photo shows A video stream on a laptop, showing a women with green lines and dots all over her face Children as young as 15 were repeatedly misidentified as being in their 20s and 30s during government tests of age-checking tools, sowing new doubts about whether the teen social media ban is viable.\n\n\"This would ensure that services which do not meet any of the proposed purpose/use tests, but are nonetheless safer and potentially beneficial for children, are carved out from the [social media ban] obligation,\" she said.\n\n\"Absent such a rule, eSafety would likely exercise discretion not to enforce compliance with the obligation for lower-risk services that are appropriate for young children in the absence of identified harm.\"\n\nIn her address to the National Press Club, Ms Inman Grant will outline other emerging threats, some of which could be addressed through the social media ban.\n\nMs Inman Grant argues some of the most problematic aspects of social media platforms are features designed to encourage endless scrolling and maximum engagement, like tailored algorithms and push notifications.\n\nBut she will also point to other risks like AI and chatbots as posing new threats.\n\n\"Just as AI has brought us much promise, it has also created much peril. And these harms aren't just hypothetical \u2014 they are taking hold right now,\" she will say, according to excerpts of her speech.\n\n\"In February, eSafety put out its first Online Safety Advisory because we were so concerned with how rapidly children as young as 10 were being captivated by AI companions \u2014 in some instances, spending up to five hours per day conversing with sexualised chatbots.\n\n\"Schools reported to us these children had been directed by their AI companions to engage in explicit and harmful sexual acts.\"\n\nLast week preliminary findings of the government's age-assurance trial, which is exploring the feasibility of blocking young people from social media and adult websites, were delivered.\n\nMs Inman Grant said that was one instance in which AI was providing a very valuable tool, and more work would be done to hone the eventual social media ban rules.",

The ranking of football codes in popularity was Australian Rules \u2014 daylight \u2014 soccer, rugby league and rugby.\n\nSione was in his first year at the public high school Elisabeth Murdoch College when he decided to try rugby at Southern Districts, a family club in nearby Seaford \u2014 a world away from the private school programs in Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nBut 'Souths' had everything children needed to improve their skills and showcase natural abilities.\n\nFohe put up his hand to coach.\n\nSione recently sent a video message to his old friends:\n\n\"I just want to say how much I miss it (Souths),\" he said.\n\n\"I've played for quite a few teams now, but I've never had more fun than when I played for Souths. I hope me and my brothers (Mosese and Ottavio) can all go back there one day and finish off our careers playing for Souths.\"\n\nFohe Tuipulotu said he had always promised he would help get his boys to the top.\n\n\"When we changed from soccer I was playing rugby here and I knew a lot of people in the sport anyway,\" he said.\n\n\"We went to Southern Districts because the coach at the time \u2014 he coached me in Powerhouse (a more prominent rugby club in Melbourne) back in the day.

The Tuipulutos' speed, power, and game sense also made them automatic selections in state underage carnivals.\n\nPrivate school St Kevin's College Toorak awarded Sione a scholarship in Year 9 and his brothers followed him to that school.\n\n\"It was a massive opportunity at the time,\" Fohe said.\n\nSione played for the Australian Schoolboys and Junior Wallabies (Australia Under 20) for three consecutive years, 2015-17.\n\nHe became the first Victorian to debut for the Melbourne Rebels.\n\nMoving abroad kick-starts Sione's rise\n\nTurmoil was caused in Australian rugby next season when the Western Force folded and many of its players came across the continent to play Super Rugby for the Rebels.\n\nSione's opportunities became scarce.\n\n\"He was doing really well,\" Fohe said.\n\nWhat makes a British and Irish Lion?

    "text": "Two major European multinationals are close to being awarded feasibility licences for Western Australia's first offshore wind farm.\n\nEDF power solutions Australia \u2014 part of the French government's EDF Group \u2014 said it was behind a proposal titled Bunbury Offshore Wind Farm North, which received preliminary approval from federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen earlier this month.\n\nMr Bowen said the project would create 900 construction jobs and 450 ongoing jobs, and generate 1.5 gigawatts of energy.\n\nIt equates to about one-tenth of the entire zone's estimated capacity, and about 3 per cent of the additional generation expected to be needed by 2042.\n\nThe proposed area of EDF's Bunbury Offshore Wind Farm North is marked in solid light blue. (Supplied: DCCEEW)\n\nEDF's second proposal for the southern part of the zone, Bunbury Offshore Wind Farm South, was also shortlisted alongside a project called Westward Wind.\n\nIndustry insiders have told the ABC Westward Wind belongs to Ocean Winds \u2014 a joint venture between Spain's EDP Renewables and France's ENGIE.\n\nOcean Winds said it could neither confirm nor deny its involvement.\n\nThe two shortlisted proposals will have to resolve the geographic overlap between them in order to progress.\n\nPerth-based Wind with Purpose also applied for a licence in partnership with the UK's Barrington Energy, but was rejected.\n\nMultinationals seek foothold\n\nThe race to build a wind farm off WA's south-west coast has been a test of endurance since the federal government named Bunbury as one of six proposed offshore wind zone locations in 2022.\n\nFaced with significant financial and regulatory headwinds, an initially eager pool of at least nine interested developers whittled itself down to three.\n\nOne early proponent forced to pull the plug, Copenhagen Energy, warned at the time the process would favour larger multinationals less willing to engage the local community.\n\nBunbury was named as a potential location in 2022. (Supplied: Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water)\n\nThe prediction appears to have been at least somewhat accurate \u2014 both EDF and Ocean Winds are large multinational companies, and neither has an office in WA.\n\nHowever both developers have demonstrated sustained interest in the Australian market, having previously applied to work on similar projects on the east coast.\n\nOcean Winds was recently approved for a feasibility licence in Gippsland, Victoria, while EDF's application to work on Newcastle's offshore wind zone was unsuccessful.\n\nEDF told the ABC it welcomed the minister's \"preliminary\" decision to approve its proposal for the Bunbury zone, and was \"committed to a responsible and consultative development process\".\n\nChris Bowen, Anthony Albanese and Roger Cook met up earlier this year. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\n\"This marks an important step in progressing a project that has the potential to support WA's energy transition and deliver long-term benefits for local communities, industry and the regional economy,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\" We look forward to engaging with local stakeholders as we undertake detailed environmental, technical and community studies. \"\n\nBack home in Europe, both power providers have faced growing political resistance on the renewable energy front.\n\nIn France, the conservative Opposition recently pushed through a moratorium on new solar and wind projects, while recent blackouts in Spain have put a target on the back of novel energy sources.\n\nThe Bunbury offshore wind farm has its own detractors in parliament and the local community, and the WA government remains on the fence.\n\nHowever, Labor's decisive victory in this year's federal election has provided some security to developers that the sector has a future in Australia.\n\nRejected developer to appeal decision\n\nWind with Purpose said it was disappointed by the government's decision to reject its Catalpa Offshore Wind Farm proposal, which was focused on powering the Kwinana Rockingham Industrial area.\n\nIt was the only developer to have signed an equity ownership agreement with local Aboriginal corporation Gnaala Karla Booja (GKB).\n\nWind with Purpose and Gnaala Karla Booja representatives signed an equity partnership agreement. (Supplied: Wind with Purpose)\n\nThe company has until early July to appeal the decision.\n\n\"We're working through that process at the moment,\" chief executive and co-founder Chris Kearney said.\n\n\"It's certainly a little disappointing but there are a couple of areas we need to address \u2026 [so] we're still hopeful.\n\n\"The government was impressed and pleased by the partnership we've established [with GKB] \u2026 they don't just want to see developers ticking the box to say they've engaged with traditional owners.\"\n\nThe government said applicants were assessed based on a range of factors, including their technical capacity and financial situation.\n\nThe final decision on feasibility licences will depend on the outcome of consultations with First Nations groups, including Gnaala Karla Booja.",

    "text": "The story of Australian pianist Geoffrey Tozer, as narrated in Janine Hosking's documentary The Eulogy, follows a familiar, tragic arc.\n\nIn the 60s and 70s, Tozer seemed set to be one of Australia's biggest international success stories.\n\nBy age 16, Tozer had performed on some of the world's most famous stages and met the who's who of classical music.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut away from the piano, Tozer seemed to lack any other skills. In later life, he dealt with alcohol addiction, dying in penury in 2009.\n\nClassical music's history is peppered with stories of exceptionally talented child musicians including household names like Mozart and Mendelssohn.\n\nEven today, young performers like violinists Christian Li and Chloe Chua have attracted enormous attention for their early success.\n\nTozer described his experience of being a child prodigy like \"an old man with no future. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.\"\n\nBut unlike Tozer, many prodigies have gone on to have happier lives and successful music careers as they've grown up.\n\nAustralian pianists Andrea Lam and Grace Kim were both labelled as prodigies when they were younger. Lam made her debut with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra aged 13. Kim was winning international music competitions before she finished high school.\n\nThey speak about their experiences navigating the label of \"child prodigy\" and how to support the next generation in their musical journeys.\n\nPerforming in front of thousands\n\nLam remembers how surreal her orchestral debut felt, describing it as \"an incredible sensory experience\".\n\n\"[I was] on stage making music with professional musicians who were treating me with respect and being on the same playing field as them.\"\n\nLam remembers her teenage years as \"the good days\". She had opportunities to hone her craft, but along with her recognition as a young musician, \"I had enough time to be a kid,\" Lam reflects.\n\nLoading...\n\n\" I definitely feel like I got to have a full life outside of piano, and I think that was really crucial. \"\n\nGifted versus hard work\n\nIn her youth, Kim preferred watching TV and reading books over spending time practising.\n\nShe loves playing the piano, learning new music and performing, but \"the practice part was the most boring thing in the whole world,\" Kim admits.\n\nDespite this tendency, Kim did well in elite competitions thanks to her ability to \"wing it.\"\n\n\"Gifted kids [like myself] tend to find ways to do what they like doing and try to avoid what they don't like doing,\" Kim says.\n\nBut as an adult, Kim doesn't see \"giftedness\" as a celebration of exceptionalism. She says it should be regarded as part of our neurodiversity.\n\n\"As someone with children now, I realise the importance of structure,\" she says. \"As a grown adult, I started practising more regularly.\"\n\nNew series busts classical music myth Photo shows Woman in blue shirt and pants sits on a stool smiling widely. She sits against a plain, grey background. ABC Classic presenter Megan Burslem hates the idea that classical music is just for some.\n\nAs a piano teacher and researcher, Kim also supports the next generation of talented pianists, some of whom have gone on to win major international music competitions.\n\nShe says maintaining boundaries between parents, teachers and students is important in supporting young musicians in their journeys.\n\n\"The parent's job is to offer love and support,\" she says. \"My role as a teacher is to give the students challenges that are proportional to their ability.\"\n\nIt's up to the students to develop their skills as musicians.\n\nDebunking the myths of young performers\n\nAudiences are always fascinated by displays of young musical talents, and we have an abundance of them.\n\nViolinist Christian Li was just 10 years old when he won the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition in 2018.\n\nTaking joint first prize with Li was 11-year-old Singapore-based violinist Chloe Chua.\n\nNow in their teens, both violinists regularly perform with major symphony orchestras, a feat which takes most musicians years to achieve.\n\nChua, 18, recently made her Australian debut alongside the Singapore Symphony Orchestra in a performance at the Sydney Opera House in February.\n\nWatch Chloe Chua perform with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra Photo shows Chloe Chua on violin and Pei-Sian Ng on cello perform on a concert stage at the front of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra In their Australian debut, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra are joined by teen violin sensation Chloe Chua for a spectacular performance in the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall.\n\n\"I find the process of learning music of different genres and by different composers very fun,\" Chua says. \"And I feel very emotionally satisfied after I have mastered a violin piece.\"\n\nChua, who is still finishing high school, is famed for her sensitive musical interpretations.\n\n\"I love to captivate and move my audiences with expressive performances and bring joy to them,\" Chua says.\n\nLam and Kim highlight that we should move away from the idea that young performers should wholly focus on only developing their musical talents.\n\n\"You have all of your life to be an adult, but you have a very specific window of time to enjoy being a kid,\" Lam says.\n\nSome of the harmful ideas around prodigies concern how much they should practise and external pressure for excellence.\n\nThe expectation for constant excellence can be hard for young musicians, Lam says.\n\nWhile Lam stresses playing an instrument at an elite level does take dedication and hours of practice, Kim says the myth that musicians should practise between eight to 10 hours a day is not healthy.\n\n\"Parents do need to create opportunities for these kids to de-stress, be healthy, exercise and focus on other things in life.\"\n\nThe opportunity to be just kids is one of the secrets to the longevity of their success, Lam and Kim say.\n\nChua's family and friends ensure she has time to just be a teenager.\n\n\"I normally take breaks between classes or my practice sessions to go out for meals with friends,\" Chua says. \"Sometimes, I also attend parties organised by the school or concerts to socialise with friends.\"\n\nLam recalls how much she liked reading and going out with her friends, some of whom are still close to her. Chua also shares similar hobbies during her free time.\n\nKim points out that for young musicians and their parents, \"music is a long game\".\n\n\"We can't stop people from labelling, but we can help ground the child by not buying into the wave,\" Kim says.\n\n\"Children need to develop the skills to be able to achieve goals in their own way,\" Kim says. \"They also need time to figure that out.\"\n\nGet a front row experience with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra concert featuring violinist Chloe Chua.

Is it influenced by what we export overseas, basic goods e.g. beef meat; unprocessed metal ores and so on? Many decades ago our dollar was close to or on par to the USA dollar. - Damien Long\n\nHi Damien, that's a great question.\n\nPartly because the US economy still sits at the centre of the global economy (although there's a lively debate about how long that will continue to be the case).\n\nPartly because Australia still generates a lot of its income from the export of bulk commodities, so global commodity prices hit our country more than others.\n\nWhen we floated our dollar on 12 December 1983, our dollar was worth somewhere around US90 cents.\n\nThe last time I checked (don't take this for gospel), our dollar had averaged somewhere around US70 to US75 cents in the post-float era.\n\nIt's currently sitting around US64.79.\n\nHowever, the Reserve Bank says we get a better idea of the value of Australia's dollar by looking at the trade weighted index (TWI).\n\nThe TWI is the price of Australia's dollar in terms of a group (or 'basket') of foreign currencies based on their share of trade with Australia.\n\nThe RBA says while bilateral exchange rates are the most frequently quoted exchange rates, the TWI provides a broader measure of whether the Australian dollar is appreciating or depreciating against the currencies of its trading partners.\n\nIn the latest weighting for the TWI (which you can see here), China's renminbi has a weight of 29.48%, the US dollar 8.6%, the Japanese yen 13.2%, and so on.\n\nAnd this is what the TWI graph looks like.\n\nIt shows the value of Australia's dollar, in terms of the TWI, is currently worth 59.6.\n\nIt looks quite similar to the AUD:USD exchange rate, but it's worth a little less.",

(ABC Kimberley: Ben Collins)\n\nFrom January 1, 2027, rental properties will also be subject to higher energy efficiency standards under the new reforms.\n\nGas hot water systems and heaters in rental properties will need to be replaced with electric alternatives once they are beyond repair. Additionally, ceiling insulation must be installed if it is not already present at the start of a lease, and homes will require draught sealing at the beginning of each tenancy.\n\nWhile living rooms in rental properties are already required to have heating, from March 1, 2027, they must also include an electric cooling system.\n\nPlan for 'rapid electrification'\n\nVictoria is facing a looming natural gas shortage because supply traditionally taken from Bass Strait is running out.\n\nWhat is happening to gas in Victoria?

(ABC News: Matt Brown)\n\nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth Melbourne described the Victorian government's changes as \"groundbreaking reforms\" for the climate and household budgets.\n\n\"We love that the nearly one third of homes occupied by renters are prioritised, meaning that some of the most vulnerable households will see an early benefit in shifting away from expensive gas to more efficient hot water, heating and cooling options,\" said the group's No More Gas campaigner Freja Leonard.\n\nBut Ms Leonard noted that homeowners struggling with the cost of living would not be able to afford to switch their current gas appliances to electric ones.\n\n\"And as gas use declines, we are concerned for those who are unable to disconnect from gas being stranded on a decreasingly affordable fuel source with ever-rising access charges,\" she said.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency Council \u2014 a not-for-profit membership association that advocates for Australia's energy management sector \u2014 said the announcement would free up gas for industry.\n\nBut CEO Luke Menzel said he was disappointed the phase-out of gas space heaters in existing homes was being abandoned.\n\n\"Every Victorian with a gas bill landing on their kitchen table this winter knows how crazy gas prices have been getting,\" Mr Menzel said.\n\n\"We can't afford not to electrify our space heating in this state.\"\n\nThe Victorian Greens also criticised the move.\n\n\"We're disappointed that Labor backed down on their plans to remove dangerous, polluting gas heaters from Victoria.

    "text": "Last week the Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said Powell was \u201cobviously afraid of his own shadow.\u201d \u201cThese high interest rates make no sense. Enough is enough,\u201d he posted on X. US President Donald Trump has called for Powell to cut rates. Credit: Bloomberg Vice President J.D. Vance described the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold as \u201cmonetary malpractice\u201d while the White House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said this week that he saw no reason for the Fed not to cut rates right now. Bowman and Waller have joined the chorus of voices arguing for an immediate rate cut.\n\nBowman said she would support a cut as soon as next month, as recent data hadn\u2019t shown any clear signs of material impacts from the tariffs. The trade war might take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect on inflation than initially expected, she said. \u201cOngoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky. \u201cAs we think about the path forward, it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate.\n\n\u201cShould inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labour market.\u201d Christopher Waller is a leading contender to replace Powell. Credit: AP Waller is of the same view. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to wait much longer because, even if the tariffs come in later, the impacts are still the same,\u201d Waller said last week. \u201cIt should be a one-off level effect and not cause persistent inflation.\u201d\n\nThere is a broad consensus that the tariffs inflationary impacts will be transitory; a one-off price shock that raises costs for US companies and prices for US consumers, but whose effects then stabilise at the higher levels. Loading The unknowns, however, are how significant those effects are and how long the transition might be. The punitive reciprocal tariffs could, for instance, generate significant and lasting supply chain shocks. The Fed hasn\u2019t forgotten the big mistake it (and most central banks) made during the pandemic, when it thought the inflationary effects of the disruptions to global supply chains would be transitory. Instead, the inflation rate soared and the Fed was forced to raise US rates sharply. That\u2019s why Powell is adopting a conservative, data-driven approach to the potential inflationary impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nAt this moment, the Fed has no data to suggest what those impacts might be and is unlikely to have that data to hand until much later this year \u2013 but is aware that the risks of cutting rates prematurely are likely to be greater than the risks of leaving them on hold. Bowman, in 2018, and Waller, in 2020, were both appointed to the Fed by Trump in his first term, with Bowman elevated to vice chair earlier this month. That position carries with it responsibility for bank supervision, with Bowman expected to oversee some deregulation of US banks, in line with the administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda. Comments by the Fed\u2019s vice chair, Michelle Bowman, and fellow governor Christopher Waller, can only add to the pressure on Powell when he appears before Congressional committees this week. Credit: Bloomberg The willingness of Bowman and Waller to support Trump\u2019s call for rate cuts comes at a key moment for the Fed. Powell\u2019s term as chair (but not as a governor) ends in May next year and Trump is expected to announce his successor before the end of this year.\n\nAmong those touted as potential chairs are former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent...and Waller. Bowman might also be in the frame. Trump would obviously look favourably on those candidates that support his conviction that US rates are too high, although his opinion is framed on a misunderstanding of how tariffs work. The Fed hasn\u2019t forgotten the big mistake it (and most central banks) made during the pandemic, when it thought the inflationary effects of the disruptions to global supply chains would be transitory. He thinks they are paid for by the companies exporting their products to the US. Few, if any, economists would share that belief. Tariffs are paid by the US importer, with their costs potentially shared between the companies and their customers. They are inflationary. In any event, Trump has made no secret of his desire to have greater influence over the Fed, even posing the question of whether he can appoint himself to the board. He will want to appoint someone he believes will do what he has always advocated and slash US rates.\n\nThe chair of the Fed is a powerful role, leading the world\u2019s most influential central bank, but the moment Trump announces a successor Powell\u2019s status will start to diminish as the focus shifts towards the views of the incoming chair. Loading An obviously partisan appointment would not just undermine Powell but would also damage perceptions of the Fed\u2019s independence, which is fundamental to its credibility and the trust within financial markets and the business community that it is acting only to pursue its dual mandate of ensuring price stability and maximising employment \u2013 that it is apolitical. There is, however, a twist. Trump could put someone beholden to him in the chair, but the decision-making body within the Fed is the Open Market Committee, whose chair is elected by its 12 voting members. It is conceivable, albeit perhaps unlikely, that Powell, who can remain a governor until February 2028, could still lead the committee beyond the end of his term as chair in May next year if its members don\u2019t trust the new Fed chair to keep their distance from the White House.",

    "text": "How much will they earn? The first pick is expected to earn about $US13.8 million (about $21.3 million) next season and $US14.5 million in season 2026-27. Subsequent picks will earn slightly less on a sliding scale down to pick 30 on $US2.7 million next season. Second-round picks get no such guarantees, but they present great value as clubs can choose to sign players to guaranteed, non-guaranteed or partially guaranteed contracts. They can also \u201cstash\u201d players (ie: tell them to play overseas until they are needed). Australian guard Johnny Furphy is a good example. Last year he missed out on the first round before the San Antonio Spurs drafted him at pick 35 and then traded him to the Indiana Pacers, who offered him a five-year deal, guaranteed for three seasons at a little under $US2 million per season. He\u2019s just played in the NBA finals.\n\nIf a player is drafted, that team \u201cowns\u201d his NBA rights, and he can only join whichever team has those rights, though they can be on-traded to other teams. Indiana Pacers guard Johnny Furphy during game five of the NBA finals. Credit: Getty Images Any Aussies in the running? There are no guarantees we will see an Australian follow in the recent footsteps of Josh Giddey or Dyson Daniels and be selected in the first round, but there are a stack of Aussies considered strong chances to be second-round picks. Brisbane Bullets centre Zikarsky, Sydney Kings forward Toohey, Duke University guard Tyrese Proctor and Illawarra Hawks centre Lachlan Olbrich were all listed in ESPN\u2019s top 100 players for the draft.\n\nAt 220 centimetres (7\u20323) without shoes (7\u20324 with shoes), Zikarsky is the tallest player in the draft and has attracted strong interest as teams look to players who can, potentially, defend San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama who stands 222cm but has a 240cm (8\u20320) wingspan. Sydney Kings player Alex Toohey. Credit: Louise Kennerley Tasmanian sharpshooter Reyne Smith, who finished his US college career with the Louisville Cardinals this past season, is also eligible, although he could potentially miss out on being picked in the draft and head to Europe. Undrafted players could still make their way to the NBA if a team invites them to Summer League or training camp. Going undrafted means any team can sign a player. Matthew Dellavedova is one such Aussie who made Cleveland\u2019s roster after not being selected. Many outlets create mock drafts to try and predict where players will end up. To give you an idea how things could end up for the four Aussies, The Athletic\u2019s Sam Vecenie had Proctor going to Brooklyn at pick 36, Toohey going to San Antonio at pick 38, Zikarsky going to Toronto at pick 39 and Olbrich to Utah at pick 53 in his mock draft on June 12.\n\nAny NBL Next Stars in the mix? The NBL also has Next Stars forward Izan Almansa in the draft while South East Melbourne Phoenix forward Malique Lewis withdrew from this year\u2019s draft and will return to the Australian league for next season in hope of boosting his position for 2026. Duke guard Tyrese Proctor. Credit: Getty Images Almansa, a Spanish international who played with Perth this past season is seen as being on the border between the first and second round. Toohey and Zikarsky are also NBL Next Stars. Why should we care about the Pelicans?\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have picks seven and 23 in the first round and most Australians wouldn\u2019t pay attention unless they take a local player, but the Pelicans have a connection to Melbourne this year as they prepare to play two pre-season games at Rod Laver Arena, first against Melbourne United on October 3, then two days later against South East Melbourne. Zion Williamson\u2019s New Orleans Pelicans are bound for Melbourne. Credit: AP That will likely mean the players taken will make their first NBA appearances in those games. Oklahoma guard Jeremiah Fears shapes as a possible pick at seven for the Pelicans, although they could package both picks and try to trade up for a higher selection. Will there be trades?\n\nOh, yes. The trades have already started, with Indiana and New Orleans swapping a 2026 first-round pick, which goes to the Pacers, for the rights to Australian guard Mojave King and pick 23 in the draft. Current players can also be traded on the night, as can this year\u2019s draft picks, future picks and players who were drafted earlier in the night. Silver will announce trades as they become official; some aren\u2019t made official by the NBA until after the draft but are reported during the night by broadcasters or journalists.

Credit: AP Superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee) has been mentioned as potentially being traded this off-season, though it looks less likely he will move right now. But nothing is certain when it comes to draft-night trades. Kevin Durant (Phoenix) has already moved to Houston. There have been some big draft-night trades over the years, including Orlando and Golden State swapping Chris Webber and Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway during the 1993 draft.\n\nWhat has fashion got to do with the draft? Quite a bit, actually. Players who attend the first round generally wear suits, sometimes custom-made ones, to mark the occasion and decorate their first walk onto the NBA stage. Dyson Daniels is congratulated by NBA commissioner Adam Silver after being selected at pick eight in the 2022 NBA draft. Credit: Getty Images The league also makes special NBA draft hats each year, which players receive after being selected. Those hats can be changed over or swapped if a trade is made. Some suits become famous or infamous, depending on their reception \u2013 LeBron James wore an all-white suit when he was drafted in 2002, while Samaki Walker\u2019s white hat and jacket in 1996, Drew Gooden\u2019s long jacket in 2003 and Jalen Rose\u2019s red pinstripes in 1995 still ring out.",

    "text": "Observational studies of the drugs included in the analysis concluded that the drugs halve the risk of hospitalisation, but the researchers are concerned that the results might be biased by differing trial designs. Generally, scientists look to randomised controlled trials for gold-standard evidence. New Zealand stopped subsidising Lagevrio in 2024 due to concerns about its effectiveness. Australia\u2019s COVID-19 Evidence Taskforce recommends against using the drug, which costs $1102 a pack. Despite that, Australian doctors gave out 315,000 scripts last year, plus another 243,000 for Paxlovid. Lagevrio and Paxlovid were the fifth and ninth-most-expensive drugs to taxpayers in 2023-24.\n\nThe taskforce only recommends Paxlovid for unvaccinated people. It offers a limited recommendation for those who have been vaccinated but are elderly and have multiple risk factors, while noting the evidence is \u201cunclear\u201d. \u201cIn our systematic review, there were no randomised controlled trials conducted in vaccinated people since 2022 that reported a benefit from COVID-19 antivirals against hospitalisation or death,\u201d said Dr Laura Edwards, a researcher at the University of NSW who led the study. Doses of the anti-viral drug Paxlovid. Credit: AP \u201cIt is timely to re-evaluate whether the cost we are paying for these drugs is appropriate.\u201d It is plausible that the drugs may be useful for a small cohort of extremely high-risk people, who are elderly and have multiple risk factors, says Cheng. But this group is rarely enrolled in medical trials, making it difficult to work out the true efficacy.\n\nLoading \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure there\u2019s much benefit in that group. But there probably isn\u2019t any harm done by it.\u201d Dr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, a senior fellow at the University of Wollongong, has published an analysis of Paxlovid\u2019s cost-benefit. He said there was evidence of a small reduction in hospitalisation risk, making the drug still worth subsidising. \u201cI think that Australia has a very reasonable, pragmatic approach, prioritising high-risk individuals who will benefit and not paying for low-risk people who probably won\u2019t.\u201d In a statement, Pfizer pointed to the first study of Paxlovid, which demonstrated an 86 per cent reduction in the risk of hospitalisation or death: \u201cReal-world data collected during the Omicron period among high-risk populations who have received COVID-19 vaccinations reinforce the effectiveness of Paxlovid in preventing hospitalisations and deaths.\u201d\n\nMSD, which sells molnupiravir, said it stood behind the drug. The Department of Health said both antivirals were under review by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, with results expected mid-2026. Lagevrio and Paxlovid work by stopping the virus that causes COVID-19 from multiplying in our cells, theoretically giving the immune system a leg up against it. The first studies by the drug companies found the two pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about 50 per cent and 89 per cent respectively in unvaccinated people.\n\nLoading But Lagevrio\u2019s 50 per cent effectiveness was only seen in a study that stopped halfway. When the full trial was analysed, whether it offered any benefit at all became debatable. A large independent study in 2022 also found it was likely no better than a placebo. A study published by Pfizer last year concluded Paxlovid\u2019s protective effect in vaccinated patients, including those at high risk, was so small as to not be statistically significant. That study began in 2021 but was only published in 2024. Research conducted by the Grattan Institute late last year found that wealthier Australians were far more likely to be prescribed COVID antivirals than those at the bottom of the income ladder, despite people living in disadvantage typically having much greater risk factors for severe disease.\n\n\u201cEssentially, like so many things in our healthcare system, the treatments and services weren\u2019t going to the people who need them most,\u201d said Peter Breadon, the Institute\u2019s health program director. Nearly all Australians have either been vaccinated or survived a COVID-19 infection, meaning there is less benefit from antivirals. And the Omicron variant is less likely to hospitalise or kill a patient than the preceding Delta variant. Professor Allen Cheng, who was once a top COVID advisor and is now director of infectious diseases at Monash Health. Credit: Nicole Reed \u201cCOVID is a different disease to what it was,\u201d said Cheng, who is now director of infectious diseases at Monash Health. \u201c[Patients] don\u2019t get pneumonia and lung white-out, generally. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re doing a study in a different disease, which is making it difficult to work out how relevant \u2026 what we found out early on [is] to what we know now.\u201d",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australians are in for a very rude shock when it becomes, this actually perhaps gets implemented and they all of a sudden are being forced to hand over that data to access services that they've freely been able to access up to this point.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Professor Daniel Angus talking about the upcoming implementation of the teen social media ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 11 this year, social media companies will be required to take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent Australians under sixteen from using their platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Angus was one of more than 140 academics and civil society organisations that signed an open letter against the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother signatory was Professor of Internet Studies at Curtin University, Tama Leaver.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that we know very little detail about the ban at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that there's a lot of moving parts. We know that there's a lot of global interest, but we don't actually have the nuts and bolts of how it's going to work as yet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Federal Government passed the legislation last November, they included a twelve month enforcement delay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time would allow for a government-commissioned trial to assess the technologies available, and for the Communications Minister to establish rules for what social media companies can and can't do.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat trial released its preliminary findings last week, announcing that age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts like Professor Angus are sceptical of this claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the key concerns that we have is how the industry often will inflate their accuracy and the utility of these approaches when we know that there are still significant issues when it comes to both gender and also racial biases, but also the general lack of efficacy of these approaches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe digital communication professor says the public have not been well-informed about the likely impacts of these technologies, since to check if a user is under 16, they must also check if they are older than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The greater risk that comes from when we're all, and that's every single person being asked to give over very sensitive personal data to vendors, third parties, perhaps the government just to access basic digital services that we've come to rely on every day and what that looks like.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these concerns, some cyber safety experts like Kirra Pendergast remain supportive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I's like all aspects of technical security, cybersecurity, cyber safety. It's never ever going to be 100%. This is never going to be the silver bullet, but it's a really, really good start because again, it sparked all of the conversations that we needed to have at every level of society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially against the ban based on technical concerns, she changed her view after seeing how parents were struggling to respond to their children's social media use.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Pendergast says the ban has the potential to help parents and educators prepare children for the digital world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's multi-pronged benefits here. It's going to help the parent that struggles with no say, sorry buddy. You can't have it until you're 16. It's definitely going to help there. It's also going to spark big conversations. It's also going to help educators get children ready in time because they're thrust into a world that they don't understand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung people like April Willis are still not convinced the ban will be effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the hard truth is that a lot of us are thinking, 'I would've found a way around it', as I'm sure many young people will. I most likely would not have listened and yeah, I would've joined it somehow some way.\"\n\n\n\nShe says being on social media as an early teen originally gave her an outlet for connection and having fun, but that as she grew up it had an impact on her mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe now 22-year-old works with mental health service ReachOut as a Youth Advocate.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says young people's views need to be included in discussions about how to implement the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Especially now that the ban's been announced, that kind of conversation with young people has come to a halt. And I think it's more important now to have young people and mental health organizations discussing this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians are not the only ones waiting to find out how the ban will work.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand, Greece, France and Spain are among other countries considering implementing similar minimum age bans.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Australia the first country to attempt to implement this kind of policy, the results could have global impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Leaver says for this to work, there is still lots left to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the rest of the world is watching Australia and hoping that this might be a blueprint, we're going to have an awful lot of work to do in the next few months to actually have a blueprint to practically do this rather than simply aspire to giving parents some reassurance, which is what ultimately I think this legislation boils down to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Almost all of Australia's top chief executives are, according to their boards at least, knocking it out of the park in terms of performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is despite sluggish productivity, persistently high carbon emissions, rising inequality and Australia's public spending on research and development being among the lowest in the OECD.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to new data from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, 91 per cent of Australia's top chief executive officers (CEOs) received some form of performance bonus last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat elevated their pay well above their base salaries (which were already over $1 million). Only five CEOs out of 142 eligible for a bonus received zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact nearly all of Australia's top CEOs are receiving these performance bonuses shows performance pay is more about rewarding conformity and discipline than risk-taking and entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\nDo we really believe 91 per cent of our CEOs made big bets that paid off last year?\n\n\n\n\n\nA more plausible explanation is that we simply reward executives for not stuffing up. Their customer base is growing in line with population growth and their prices are rising faster than their cost of production, which means profits rise without too much effort.\n\n\n\nNot keeping up with change\n\nTake the electricity industry for example. It's hard to imagine an industry in which change is more inevitable than the industry responsible for transitioning away from gas and coal-fired power stations to renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the electricity, gas and water industry spends a mere 0.24 per cent of sales on research and development each year. That is half the economy-wide average.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, innovation does not appear to be a prerequisite for CEOs being rewarded with large bonuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Energy Australia, its CEO Mark Collette (base salary over $1 million) recently challenged a room full of other well-paid leaders at Australian Energy Week to continuously ask themselves: \"Will this make energy cheaper?\"\n\n\n\nHowever instead of focusing on keeping costs down for consumers, companies have sometimes resorted to misleading statements. Energy Australia recently admitted to misleading customers by claiming the coal and gas-fired electricity it was selling was \"carbon neutral\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Australia was buying widely used carbon offsets to make the claim the fossil-fuel fired electricity it was selling was carbon neutral. In its apology, Energy Australia conceded \"offsets do not prevent or undo the harms caused by burning fossil fuels for a customer's energy use\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is clear Energy Australia's spending on carbon credits did nothing to make the company's energy cheaper, it is not yet clear if the board will award a \"performance bonus\".\n\n\n\nLeading the world \u2014 in pay packets\n\nAnother example of the lack of relationship between CEO pay and organisational performance is Australia's university sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vice chancellors of Australian universities are among the best paid in the world, with over a dozen Australian earning more than the head of Cambridge University.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO SBS On the Money: Are Australian executives paid too much? SBS News 12/06/2024 12:16 Play\n\nBut there is no correlation between student satisfaction and vice chancellor pay.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while Australian vice chancellor pay has been soaring, Australian universities have been slipping steadily down international rankings for university quality.\n\n\n\nInequality is rising\n\nWhile performance-based bonuses and incentives are common among CEOs and vice chancellors, the same is not true for lower-paid staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, these staff are often asked to \"do more, with less\" even as their real wages have declined.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities have seen a notable decline in academic staff per student while the gap between the pay of lecturers and vice chancellors has skyrocketed.\n\n\n\nExtremely high salaries for CEOs and vice chancellors have done nothing to boost Australian productivity growth, or our performance in global rankings for our universities, research and development or innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying out large bonuses for average performance has done little to help either.\n\n\n\n\n\nInequality in Australia is rising. As long as CEO pay is rising faster than the minimum wages, that gap will continue to widen. The latest data showed CEO salaries are 55 times that of the average worker.\n\n\n\nJust doing their job\n\nWhile it is true it is hard to measure the performance of a CEO, it's also hard to measure the care and attention provided by a childcare worker, the compassion of an aged care nurse, the helpfulness of a call centre operator or the enthusiasm of a lecturer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew CEOs think we need bonuses to motivate the vast majority of Australian workers. But it is heresy to suggest those at the top of a big organisation could simply work diligently without a giant bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, it's not just income that is unequal in Australia. We expect a lot more self-motivation from those at the bottom of the income distribution than those at the very top.\n\n\n\n",

Source: Anadolu / Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images Australian Travel Industry Association CEO Dean Long said airfares were not likely to increase immediately following the escalation in conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said travellers heading through the Middle East on their way to Europe would likely face longer journeys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The increase in congestion is causing delays,\" he told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the narrowest flight path in recent memory \u2014 with Russia, Ukraine, Iran and Israel closed \u2014 the airspace is very narrow to get to Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Beforehand, there were multiple ways to catch up delays and stay on time, but in reality, there is a very narrow window to catch up delays, and there is less room for error by the airlines.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What is the Strait of Hormuz and what could happen if Iran blocks it?\n\nLong said there had not been any major disruptions for Australian travellers so far and urged passengers not to cancel their flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has backed the US's intervention in the conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Iran should not have access to nuclear weapons, Albanese said a de-escalation was needed.\n\n\n\n",

If the homes remain unsold, the developer can call on the guarantee and the government will purchase them for either build-to-rent, affordable, or social housing.

    "text": "Last week the Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said Powell was \u201cobviously afraid of his own shadow.\u201d \u201cThese high interest rates make no sense. Enough is enough,\u201d he posted on X. US President Donald Trump has called for Powell to cut rates. Credit: Bloomberg Vice President J.D. Vance described the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold as \u201cmonetary malpractice\u201d while the White House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said this week that he saw no reason for the Fed not to cut rates right now. Bowman and Waller have joined the chorus of voices arguing for an immediate rate cut.\n\nBowman said she would support a cut as soon as next month, as recent data hadn\u2019t shown any clear signs of material impacts from the tariffs. The trade war might take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect on inflation than initially expected, she said. \u201cOngoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky. \u201cAs we think about the path forward, it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate.\n\n\u201cShould inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labour market.\u201d Christopher Waller is a leading contender to replace Powell. Credit: AP Waller is of the same view. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to wait much longer because, even if the tariffs come in later, the impacts are still the same,\u201d Waller said last week. \u201cIt should be a one-off level effect and not cause persistent inflation.\u201d\n\nThere is a broad consensus that the tariffs inflationary impacts will be transitory; a one-off price shock that raises costs for US companies and prices for US consumers, but whose effects then stabilise at the higher levels. Loading The unknowns, however, are how significant those effects are and how long the transition might be. The punitive reciprocal tariffs could, for instance, generate significant and lasting supply chain shocks. The Fed hasn\u2019t forgotten the big mistake it (and most central banks) made during the pandemic, when it thought the inflationary effects of the disruptions to global supply chains would be transitory. Instead, the inflation rate soared and the Fed was forced to raise US rates sharply. That\u2019s why Powell is adopting a conservative, data-driven approach to the potential inflationary impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nAt this moment, the Fed has no data to suggest what those impacts might be and is unlikely to have that data to hand until much later this year \u2013 but is aware that the risks of cutting rates prematurely are likely to be greater than the risks of leaving them on hold. Bowman, in 2018, and Waller, in 2020, were both appointed to the Fed by Trump in his first term, with Bowman elevated to vice chair earlier this month. That position carries with it responsibility for bank supervision, with Bowman expected to oversee some deregulation of US banks, in line with the administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda. Comments by the Fed\u2019s vice chair, Michelle Bowman, and fellow governor Christopher Waller, can only add to the pressure on Powell when he appears before Congressional committees this week. Credit: Bloomberg The willingness of Bowman and Waller to support Trump\u2019s call for rate cuts comes at a key moment for the Fed. Powell\u2019s term as chair (but not as a governor) ends in May next year and Trump is expected to announce his successor before the end of this year.\n\nAmong those touted as potential chairs are former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent...and Waller. Bowman might also be in the frame. Trump would obviously look favourably on those candidates that support his conviction that US rates are too high, although his opinion is framed on a misunderstanding of how tariffs work. The Fed hasn\u2019t forgotten the big mistake it (and most central banks) made during the pandemic, when it thought the inflationary effects of the disruptions to global supply chains would be transitory. He thinks they are paid for by the companies exporting their products to the US. Few, if any, economists would share that belief. Tariffs are paid by the US importer, with their costs potentially shared between the companies and their customers. They are inflationary. In any event, Trump has made no secret of his desire to have greater influence over the Fed, even posing the question of whether he can appoint himself to the board. He will want to appoint someone he believes will do what he has always advocated and slash US rates.\n\nThe chair of the Fed is a powerful role, leading the world\u2019s most influential central bank, but the moment Trump announces a successor Powell\u2019s status will start to diminish as the focus shifts towards the views of the incoming chair. Loading An obviously partisan appointment would not just undermine Powell but would also damage perceptions of the Fed\u2019s independence, which is fundamental to its credibility and the trust within financial markets and the business community that it is acting only to pursue its dual mandate of ensuring price stability and maximising employment \u2013 that it is apolitical. There is, however, a twist. Trump could put someone beholden to him in the chair, but the decision-making body within the Fed is the Open Market Committee, whose chair is elected by its 12 voting members. It is conceivable, albeit perhaps unlikely, that Powell, who can remain a governor until February 2028, could still lead the committee beyond the end of his term as chair in May next year if its members don\u2019t trust the new Fed chair to keep their distance from the White House.",

    "text": "How much will they earn? The first pick is expected to earn about $US13.8 million (about $21.3 million) next season and $US14.5 million in season 2026-27. Subsequent picks will earn slightly less on a sliding scale down to pick 30 on $US2.7 million next season. Second-round picks get no such guarantees, but they present great value as clubs can choose to sign players to guaranteed, non-guaranteed or partially guaranteed contracts. They can also \u201cstash\u201d players (ie: tell them to play overseas until they are needed). Australian guard Johnny Furphy is a good example. Last year he missed out on the first round before the San Antonio Spurs drafted him at pick 35 and then traded him to the Indiana Pacers, who offered him a five-year deal, guaranteed for three seasons at a little under $US2 million per season. He\u2019s just played in the NBA finals.\n\nIf a player is drafted, that team \u201cowns\u201d his NBA rights, and he can only join whichever team has those rights, though they can be on-traded to other teams. Indiana Pacers guard Johnny Furphy during game five of the NBA finals. Credit: Getty Images Any Aussies in the running? There are no guarantees we will see an Australian follow in the recent footsteps of Josh Giddey or Dyson Daniels and be selected in the first round, but there are a stack of Aussies considered strong chances to be second-round picks. Brisbane Bullets centre Zikarsky, Sydney Kings forward Toohey, Duke University guard Tyrese Proctor and Illawarra Hawks centre Lachlan Olbrich were all listed in ESPN\u2019s top 100 players for the draft.\n\nAt 220 centimetres (7\u20323) without shoes (7\u20324 with shoes), Zikarsky is the tallest player in the draft and has attracted strong interest as teams look to players who can, potentially, defend San Antonio superstar Victor Wembanyama who stands 222cm but has a 240cm (8\u20320) wingspan. Sydney Kings player Alex Toohey. Credit: Louise Kennerley Tasmanian sharpshooter Reyne Smith, who finished his US college career with the Louisville Cardinals this past season, is also eligible, although he could potentially miss out on being picked in the draft and head to Europe. Undrafted players could still make their way to the NBA if a team invites them to Summer League or training camp. Going undrafted means any team can sign a player. Matthew Dellavedova is one such Aussie who made Cleveland\u2019s roster after not being selected. Many outlets create mock drafts to try and predict where players will end up. To give you an idea how things could end up for the four Aussies, The Athletic\u2019s Sam Vecenie had Proctor going to Brooklyn at pick 36, Toohey going to San Antonio at pick 38, Zikarsky going to Toronto at pick 39 and Olbrich to Utah at pick 53 in his mock draft on June 12.\n\nAny NBL Next Stars in the mix? The NBL also has Next Stars forward Izan Almansa in the draft while South East Melbourne Phoenix forward Malique Lewis withdrew from this year\u2019s draft and will return to the Australian league for next season in hope of boosting his position for 2026. Duke guard Tyrese Proctor. Credit: Getty Images Almansa, a Spanish international who played with Perth this past season is seen as being on the border between the first and second round. Toohey and Zikarsky are also NBL Next Stars. Why should we care about the Pelicans?\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have picks seven and 23 in the first round and most Australians wouldn\u2019t pay attention unless they take a local player, but the Pelicans have a connection to Melbourne this year as they prepare to play two pre-season games at Rod Laver Arena, first against Melbourne United on October 3, then two days later against South East Melbourne. Zion Williamson\u2019s New Orleans Pelicans are bound for Melbourne. Credit: AP That will likely mean the players taken will make their first NBA appearances in those games. Oklahoma guard Jeremiah Fears shapes as a possible pick at seven for the Pelicans, although they could package both picks and try to trade up for a higher selection. Will there be trades?\n\nOh, yes. The trades have already started, with Indiana and New Orleans swapping a 2026 first-round pick, which goes to the Pacers, for the rights to Australian guard Mojave King and pick 23 in the draft. Current players can also be traded on the night, as can this year\u2019s draft picks, future picks and players who were drafted earlier in the night. Silver will announce trades as they become official; some aren\u2019t made official by the NBA until after the draft but are reported during the night by broadcasters or journalists. Orlando Magic\u2019s Anfernee Hardaway drives at New Jersey Nets\u2019 centre Shawn Bradley in 1996. Credit: AP Superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee) has been mentioned as potentially being traded this off-season, though it looks less likely he will move right now. But nothing is certain when it comes to draft-night trades. Kevin Durant (Phoenix) has already moved to Houston. There have been some big draft-night trades over the years, including Orlando and Golden State swapping Chris Webber and Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway during the 1993 draft.\n\nWhat has fashion got to do with the draft? Quite a bit, actually. Players who attend the first round generally wear suits, sometimes custom-made ones, to mark the occasion and decorate their first walk onto the NBA stage. Dyson Daniels is congratulated by NBA commissioner Adam Silver after being selected at pick eight in the 2022 NBA draft. Credit: Getty Images The league also makes special NBA draft hats each year, which players receive after being selected. Those hats can be changed over or swapped if a trade is made. Some suits become famous or infamous, depending on their reception \u2013 LeBron James wore an all-white suit when he was drafted in 2002, while Samaki Walker\u2019s white hat and jacket in 1996, Drew Gooden\u2019s long jacket in 2003 and Jalen Rose\u2019s red pinstripes in 1995 still ring out.",

    "text": "Observational studies of the drugs included in the analysis concluded that the drugs halve the risk of hospitalisation, but the researchers are concerned that the results might be biased by differing trial designs. Generally, scientists look to randomised controlled trials for gold-standard evidence. New Zealand stopped subsidising Lagevrio in 2024 due to concerns about its effectiveness. Australia\u2019s COVID-19 Evidence Taskforce recommends against using the drug, which costs $1102 a pack. Despite that, Australian doctors gave out 315,000 scripts last year, plus another 243,000 for Paxlovid. Lagevrio and Paxlovid were the fifth and ninth-most-expensive drugs to taxpayers in 2023-24.\n\nThe taskforce only recommends Paxlovid for unvaccinated people. It offers a limited recommendation for those who have been vaccinated but are elderly and have multiple risk factors, while noting the evidence is \u201cunclear\u201d. \u201cIn our systematic review, there were no randomised controlled trials conducted in vaccinated people since 2022 that reported a benefit from COVID-19 antivirals against hospitalisation or death,\u201d said Dr Laura Edwards, a researcher at the University of NSW who led the study. Doses of the anti-viral drug Paxlovid. Credit: AP \u201cIt is timely to re-evaluate whether the cost we are paying for these drugs is appropriate.\u201d It is plausible that the drugs may be useful for a small cohort of extremely high-risk people, who are elderly and have multiple risk factors, says Cheng. But this group is rarely enrolled in medical trials, making it difficult to work out the true efficacy.\n\nLoading \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure there\u2019s much benefit in that group. But there probably isn\u2019t any harm done by it.\u201d Dr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, a senior fellow at the University of Wollongong, has published an analysis of Paxlovid\u2019s cost-benefit. He said there was evidence of a small reduction in hospitalisation risk, making the drug still worth subsidising. \u201cI think that Australia has a very reasonable, pragmatic approach, prioritising high-risk individuals who will benefit and not paying for low-risk people who probably won\u2019t.\u201d In a statement, Pfizer pointed to the first study of Paxlovid, which demonstrated an 86 per cent reduction in the risk of hospitalisation or death: \u201cReal-world data collected during the Omicron period among high-risk populations who have received COVID-19 vaccinations reinforce the effectiveness of Paxlovid in preventing hospitalisations and deaths.\u201d\n\nMSD, which sells molnupiravir, said it stood behind the drug. The Department of Health said both antivirals were under review by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, with results expected mid-2026. Lagevrio and Paxlovid work by stopping the virus that causes COVID-19 from multiplying in our cells, theoretically giving the immune system a leg up against it. The first studies by the drug companies found the two pills cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about 50 per cent and 89 per cent respectively in unvaccinated people.\n\nLoading But Lagevrio\u2019s 50 per cent effectiveness was only seen in a study that stopped halfway. When the full trial was analysed, whether it offered any benefit at all became debatable. A large independent study in 2022 also found it was likely no better than a placebo. A study published by Pfizer last year concluded Paxlovid\u2019s protective effect in vaccinated patients, including those at high risk, was so small as to not be statistically significant. That study began in 2021 but was only published in 2024. Research conducted by the Grattan Institute late last year found that wealthier Australians were far more likely to be prescribed COVID antivirals than those at the bottom of the income ladder, despite people living in disadvantage typically having much greater risk factors for severe disease.\n\n\u201cEssentially, like so many things in our healthcare system, the treatments and services weren\u2019t going to the people who need them most,\u201d said Peter Breadon, the Institute\u2019s health program director. Nearly all Australians have either been vaccinated or survived a COVID-19 infection, meaning there is less benefit from antivirals. And the Omicron variant is less likely to hospitalise or kill a patient than the preceding Delta variant. Professor Allen Cheng, who was once a top COVID advisor and is now director of infectious diseases at Monash Health. Credit: Nicole Reed \u201cCOVID is a different disease to what it was,\u201d said Cheng, who is now director of infectious diseases at Monash Health. \u201c[Patients] don\u2019t get pneumonia and lung white-out, generally. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re doing a study in a different disease, which is making it difficult to work out how relevant \u2026 what we found out early on [is] to what we know now.\u201d",

    "text": "It was early days in his broadcasting career when Sportsnet\u2019s Joe Siddall was getting a cameo in the television booth and quickly learned how Buck Martinez, his partner that day, was much more than just a smooth voice and a revered Blue Jays personality.\n\nAnd the lessons learned that day resonated to the point that it provided Siddall one of his biggest leaps forward in his own broadcasting career.\n\n\u201cBuck and I were taping an intro and 10 or 20 seconds in I butchered it and it was \u2018OK, Take 2,'\u201d Siddall recalled of that day in the Rogers Centre TV booth where he was moved up from the radio booth as a fill-in for Pat Tabler. \u201cThen 20 seconds into the next one, I butchered that one as well and it was on to Take 3.\n\n\u201cFinally, Buck just looked at me and said \u2018Put your (bleeping) paper down, look in that camera and pretend you\u2019re talking to your son about baseball.\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe light bulb went on and it just freed me up. It was early on but to this day I say it was a turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSiddall hasn\u2019t looked back since, developing into one of the most trusted and versatile voices on Sportsnet\u2019s Blue Jays telecasts.\n\nHe also has emerged as the heir apparent to Martinez, whenever the day comes that Buck stops talking baseball for a Canada-wide TV audience.\n\nTo be clear, Martinez has no plans to go anywhere even though he has been absent for the past 22 games for what he described as regular time off in his reduced schedule. The 76-year-old is set to return to the Sportsnet airwaves next Monday when the New York Yankees visit the Rogers Centre for a four-game series.\n\nFor the third year now, Siddall has been the steady backup to Martinez after the latter trimmed his workload to 100 games a season. The resulting reconfiguration Siddall shuffling from the Blue Jays Central studio to the game broadcast booth for a near-even split of the 130 contracted games he works each season.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Windsor native and former catcher (like all Jays analysts, it seems) has quietly become an important voice to the team\u2019s coverage. His in-depth breakdowns \u2014 and honest, transparent criticism when warranted \u2014 shines through in his studio segments. And that insight has travelled nicely to the booth.\n\nSiddall appreciates both roles, but clearly thrives on the immediacy of game analysis.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about doing both is the variety,\u201d Siddall said prior to a game in the Jays recently completed homestand. \u201cThat mix is great. But what I love about the booth is that it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re back in the game again. You\u2019re going pitch to pitch, thinking along with the pitcher and catcher, what the infield is doing, how the outfield is playing. It\u2019s in the moment more. It\u2019s that little fix to make up for not playing any more.\n\n\u201cI like the mix, but I know when I go to the booth I know I love it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Martinez won\u2019t be a fixture in the booth forever \u2014 although the former Jays catcher, manager and long-time broadcaster is still energized by his career and loves what he does. Having Siddall quietly and confidently climbing from radio, to studio, to insightful game analysis sure shapes up as an ideal succession plan, however.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m forever grateful for the guys I\u2019ve had the chance to work with,\u201d Siddall said. \u201cWhen I first started on radio, Jerry Howarth was a mentor. I wasn\u2019t a broadcaster and I came into the business working alongside what I would consider the best in the business. I was very fortunate for his guidance and his hints on when to come in and when to get out. It was fantastic.\n\n\u201cFilling in for (Pat Tabler) I was working with Buck, which was great, and then starting to do (TV game work) more full time and I\u2019m with Dan Shulman? Come on. I\u2019ve been very fortunate as someone who had zero broadcasting experience to work with guys like that, some of the best in the business.\u201d\n\nTHE BLUE JAYS SHUFFLE\n\nIn part due to Martinez\u2019s extended break this month, viewers have seen a revolving cast on Blue Jays telecasts. With Dan Shulman on vacation the past couple of weeks, his son Ben slid over from the radio booth to fill in working alongside both Siddall and Caleb Joseph.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the Jays on the road to Cleveland and Boston this week, Dan Shulman returns with Siddall at his side. The regular top crew of the elder Shulman and Martinez are scheduled to be reunited after an absence of almost 30 days when the Bronx Bombers arrive in town next Monday.\n\nAROUND THE DIAL\n\nThe latest punch for the sports media biz hit The Score late last week with dozens of editorial workers unceremoniously let go on the digital side by the once-proud website and leading sports app. Without all the details, it\u2019s still not difficult to surmise that owners Penn National were feeling the pinch of the competitive sports betting landscape in Canada. The Score\u2019s primary business, of course, is the ScoreBet \u2026 Speaking of Ben Shulman, the more work he gets filling in for his father, the more comfortable he sounds on the TV airwaves. Of course those who have listened to him on radio the past two seasons are well aware of his impressive progress.",

(Trevor Lyons/Radio-Canada - image credit)\n\nThe family of a woman who recently became the second person in Manitoba to have a water cremation said they feel at peace knowing that they could give her the burial she wanted just weeks after it became available in the province.\n\nElizabeth Crossley said her mother, Elizabeth Crossley Sr., had been talking about alkaline hydrolysis \u2014 or aquamation \u2014 since she first heard about it a few years ago.\n\nInstead of traditional fire cremation, aquamation is an eco-friendly alternative that uses a hot water and alkali solution to break down the body's proteins and sugars, speeding up the natural decomposition process until only the bones remain.\n\nCrossley said her mother was instantly drawn to the process and started discussing it with family, friends and medical providers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I guess she identified more with the water process. She loved water and I guess her soul just liked the idea of that better,\" Crossley said.\n\n\"I feel a lot of peace knowing we could give her what she wanted.\"\n\nWhen Crossley's mother died a few weeks ago at the age of 65, the service had just become available in Manitoba.\n\nHad her mother died sooner, Crossley said the family would have had to travel out of province to ensure she received the end-of-life care she wanted.\n\nSaskatchewan was the first Canadian province to legalize aquamation in 2012, followed by Ontario in 2014.\n\nHeadingley-based funeral and aquamation services company Tillwell Inc. got its final licence approvals to start operating just a few weeks ago. It is the first and only company in Manitoba to offer the service.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Had she died three weeks sooner, we would have been shipping her to Saskatchewan to have it done. So good timing, I guess,\" Crossley said.\n\nCrossley Sr. was just the second person to have an aquamation service in Manitoba.\n\n\"Death is a personal experience and people ought to choose the form of final disposition that means the most to them,\" said Dwayne Till, CEO and founder of Tillwell.\n\nTill said aquamation is a \"much gentler, way less energy intensive\" process compared to traditional flame cremation that uses machines that run at up to 1,000 C for several hours.\n\nDwayne Till is the CEO and founder of Winnipeg-based funeral and aquamation services company Tillwell. His company is the first in Manitoba to offer aquamation services. (Trevor Lyons/Radio-Canada )\n\nTill said the deceased person's body is put inside a hot water tank, where the alkali-water solution is heated to just under 100 C and circulated over the body for about 18 hours, using propellers in the back of the tank.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe fluid is then sent through the sewage system, where it is treated.\n\n\"You can actually repurpose some of the fluid that's left behind,\" Till said, adding he would eventually like to see it used by local farmers as a natural fertilizer, if provincial regulators allow.\n\nThe bones are then dried and processed into a powder and returned to the deceased's loved ones, much like ashes after flame cremation. Except this powder \u2014 or \"mineral remains,\" as Till's company calls them \u2014 has a neutral pH level and is safe to return to the earth.\n\nTill's company charges $1,895 for direct aquamation services and $3,500 for aquamation with a tree ceremony and burial.\n\nCrossley's family decided on a tree ceremony.\n\n\"My mom, she always said she wanted to be a tree,\" Crossley said.\n\n\"We are planning on putting a tree in my brother's backyard and that way she's close by \u2026 and her soul can go back to the earth.\"",

    "text": "Edmonton Oilers' Connor Brown (28) celebrates his goal against the Los Angeles Kings with Trent Frederic (21) and Ty Emberson (49) during first period NHL playoff action, in Edmonton Thursday May 1, 2025. (Credit: David Bloom)\n\nIs Trent Frederic about to become a long-term member of the Edmonton Oilers?\n\nIn a word\u2026yes.\n\nThe talk is an eight-year term with an AAV between $3.5-4m for the feisty forward and pending UFA in Edmonton. And it sounds like some form of no-move clause would accompany that. Frederic is coming off a two-year deal with an AAV of $2.3m. My view is that the term is probably close, and that the money will lean heavily closer to a four than a three.\n\nThe are objectively lots of reasons to like this player on the Oilers longer term. Your milage may vary.\n\nHe is a little younger than the core, will not be twenty-eight until February. He has lots of size (6\u20193, 221). And he has an abundance of grit and is not shy to use it in the right situations. Frederic has hands and is more than willing to go to the net (scored 17 and 18 goals in Boston between 2022-23 and 2023-24) where they are productive tools. He is also flexible. He can play both wings and center, although his NHL faceoff average is a mere 44.4%. And on top of all that\u2026he wants to be in Edmonton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn short, Trent Frederic ticks an awful lot of boxes for the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nSo, why worry? Well in fairness, there are a few things.\n\nNo, he did not set the world on fire in the post-season. His offence was just 1-3-4 in 22 GP, with eighty-five hits. But I can not stress enough that the most likely source of that was what has reported as a high ankle sprain. Although I wonder if we will someday learn that it was instead in fact a broken foot. But I digress. Regardless, I had multiple viewings of Frederic prior to that, and my thought was always \u201cMan, I\u2019d sure like to have that on my team.\u201d And I still feel that way.\n\nYou may be concerned how his regular season production fell off last season, from close to a twenty-goal scorer in consecutive years to just eight in fifty-seven games. That is fair. But equally so, I note that his most common linemate with the Bruins Charlie Coyle also regressed from 25-35-60 in 2023-24 to 15-7-22 in the sixty-four games before he was dealt to Colorado. Methinks the two are related.\n\nFinally, you may also be concerned about the possible term being thrown around and I can sympathize with you there. An eight-year contract term can indeed help keep the AAV down when cap considerations are important. But Frederic\u2019s player type is also more susceptible to injury. It is not a shortcoming, just a fact.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut after all of that, am I convinced that Trent Frederic is the kind of player the Oilers need? Yes. I am only moderately concerned on a production front. And yes, the reported term is a bit of worry, but it probably only becomes an issue after the Edmonton Oilers\u2019 cup window closes.\n\nI project Frederic as a long-term middle six guy, more likely a staple on a line with significant defensive responsibilities and energy. I very much-admired Frederic\u2019s defensive conscience in the post-season. He is keenly aware of on-ice situations in front of him and tracks back diligently. And I do expect him to get a real shot at pivot.\n\nI also expect Frederic to become a value member of the Edmonton Oilers\u2019 special team\u2019s deployment. In 2024 the Bruins PK with Frederic involved enjoyed an 82.5% success rate. He was a regular PK guy in Boston. And I expect he will be in Edmonton also.\n\nI also expect we will hear of this signing within days.\n\nNow on Bluesky @kurtleavins.bsky.social.

(Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes - image credit)\n\nCanada and Europe were drawn a little closer together Monday after Prime Minister Mark Carney signed a strategic defence and security partnership with the European Union.\n\nThe agreement opens the door for Canadian companies to participate in the $1.25-trillion ReArm Europe program, which is seen as a step toward making Canada less reliant on \u2014 and less vulnerable to \u2014 the whims of the United States.\n\nEventually, it will also help the Canadian government partner with other allied nations to buy military equipment under what's known as the SAFE program.\n\n\"It will help us deliver on our new requirements for capabilities more rapidly and more effectively, it will help build our industries, secure our jurisdictions,\" Carney said at the closing news conference of the Canada-EU summit in Brussels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We are very pleased to be taking this important step towards participation in SAFE as part of ReArm/Readiness Europe bringing shared expertise, joint research and innovation.\"\n\nWATCH | Canada joins European military pact:\n\nA joint EU/Canada statement released Monday explained Canada will work to increase defence and security co-operation through SAFE and the new security and defence partnership, which will require further talks and agreements before both become reality.\n\nThe statement said Canada and the EU will:\n\nBoost co-operation on maritime security, cybersecurity and other threats to further peace efforts.\n\nExpand maritime security co-operation and increase co-ordinated naval activities.\n\nIncrease defence industrial co-operation.\n\nProtect democratic institutions by working together to combat disinformation.\n\nTighten Canada's integration with EU forces to improve interoperability in the field.\n\nCo-operate on defence procurement through the ReArm Europe initiative.\n\nWork toward a bilateral agreement related to SAFE.\n\nExplore forming closer ties between Canada and the European Defence Agency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarney has been signalling for months that his government is unhappy with spending as much as 70 per cent of its military equipment appropriation on U.S.-made gear.\n\nOther non-EU nations, including the United Kingdom, have already struck their own strategic agreements. Australia signalled last week it has started negotiations on a deal with Europe.\n\nWATCH | Retired vice-admiral on EU deal:\n\nMuch of the focus has been on the joint equipment procurement aspects of the impending deal. However, the U.K.'s agreement, made public on May 19, establishes a series of institutional links for crisis management, maritime security and cybersecurity.\n\nIt is nowhere near as comprehensive as the NATO alliance. But given the growing uncertainty over the reliability of the Trump administration, the partnership is important.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It could complement NATO. It's not necessarily a substitute,\" said Stephen Saideman, who holds the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney, from left, met with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other members of the new European defence pact, at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., last week. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\n\n\"It makes sense to work with the Europeans as much as we can on defence,\" he said. \"Maybe if we do this kind of thing, NATO can live even if the United States pulls out.\"\n\nThe joint statement released on Monday also says the two parties have agreed to forge a \"new ambitious and comprehensive partnership\" to \"promote shared prosperity, democratic values, peace and security\" that goes well beyond security co-operation.\n\nTo do that, the statement says, Canada and the EU have launched a process that \"will move Canada and the EU closer together\" on a number of fronts such as trade, supply chains, aligning regulations, artificial intelligence, climate change, justice and international crisis response on top of security and defence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Today this is a new era of co-operation,\" Carney said. \"[This] brings us closer together from defence to digital, from supply chains to security.\"\n\nNATO spending to be debated\n\nCarney will be attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in The Hague, in the Netherlands, almost immediately after signing the defence and security deal with the EU\n\nThe 32-member Western military alliance is set to debate raising the defence spending benchmark to a combined five per cent of a country's gross domestic product (3.5 per cent for direct military spending and an additional 1.5 per cent for defence infrastructure).\n\nWATCH | Canada looks to reduce reliance on U.S.:\n\nChristian Leuprecht, a professor at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ont., said the way the defence partnership and the ReArm Europe program are set up, they could not be considered a replacement for NATO because there's no operational military aspect to the individual arrangements.\n\nHowever, a significant aspect of the U.K. deal involves strengthening co-operation through \"exchanges on situational awareness and threat assessments in areas of common interest, including classified information.\"\n\nThe agreement goes on to say that \"the U.K. and the EU will explore additional measures to ensure that classified information can be exchanged swiftly, safely and effectively\" in accordance with Britain's security of information laws. That's significant because the U.K. \u2014 like Canada \u2014 is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network that includes the United States.\n\nIt remains unclear, at the moment, whether Canada's deal will contain similar provisions.\n\nLeuprecht describes ReArm Europe as a \"cartel\" with a mission to drive down prices of military equipment through collective procurement.\n\nA big component of the EU scheme is the SAFE loan program that allows member countries to borrow from a $235-billion fund for military equipment at more favourable rates than direct national borrowing. It's intended for smaller countries with less fiscal capacity and lower credit ratings, Leuprecht said.\n\nThere are rules to the loan program that encourage members to buy European and partner equipment.",

    "text": "Sullivan's Crossing Season 3 has come to an end with another massive cliffhanger that will shock every single one of the show's viewers. From relationship drama between Cal (Chad Michael Murray) and Maggie (Morgan Kohan), to a significant health scare for Edna (Andrea Menard), it's a bombshell of an ending.\n\nThe two-part finale begins at the Timberlake Regional Hospital where we find out that Edna has a five-centimetre tumour, which resulted in her vision loss. Maggie tires to assure her that 90 per cent of meningiomas are benign, but Edna is put in the position to decide if she wants to have a surgery in the coming days.\n\nIf she doesn't do the surgery, her vision loss will be permanent.\n\nBut Edna's MRI results revealed a more complicated diagnosis. Edna's tumour is compressing and narrowing her carotid artery, which supplies blood to the left side of the brain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Maggie goes to give Edna the update, she has to tell her that the surgery could result in her experiencing a life-altering stroke during the procedure. Worst case, she could lose her ability to think and communicate.\n\n\"Then I wouldn't be me anymore,\" Edna says.\n\nCal gets worried about Maggie, telling her that she doesn't have to hide her feelings from him.\n\n\"I don't have time for feelings,\" Maggie says. \"This is what I'm trained for, remember. ... I'm the only neurosurgeon here, I have to be there for her.\"\n\nAndrea Menard and Tom Jackson in Sullivan's Crossing Season 3, premieres Sundays at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CTV, CTV.ca and the CTV app, and streams next day on Crave\n\n'Some risks are worth taking'\n\nBut having a particularly honest conversation with Edna, Maggie is adamant that the surgery is the best option she has.\n\n\"You once told me some risks are worth taking,\" Maggie says. \"This surgery will give you and Frank the chance to have a long and happy life together. Isn't that worth fighting for?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCal and Sully (Scott Patterson) also talk to Edna about her possible surgery. With Cal, they reminisce about when he first came to the Crossing from New York, struggling and looking for \"a place to call home.\"\n\n\"You welcomed me with opened arms,\" Cal says to Edna. \"You even offered me odd jobs just to keep me busy. ... I'm not sure I'd still be here today if it wasn't for you.\"\n\nThen Sully comes in with chocolates for Edna, saying that he's been thinking about when she first moved to the Crossing with Frank (Tom Jackson), and since then they've always been family to him.\n\n\"When I thought I'd reached the end of my rope, there you were, waiting on the other end to help pull me up,\" Sully says. \"So I know what it's like to be afraid, and I'm here for you. No matter what you decide.\"\n\nEdna decides that, if Maggie really thinks she should have the surgery, then Edna will agree to it, on one condition. Maggie has to be the surgeon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaggie then asks Cal if she's making a mistake, taking on this complex surgery on someone she loves, saying that she's not sure she's the surgeon to take on the task. That prompts Maggie to call Walter (Peter Outerbridge) for advice. He says the procedure sounds right for the circumstances, but then Maggie asks if she should be doing the surgery, or if she's too close to Edna and has been out of the operating room for too long to do it.\n\n\"Remember to trust your instincts. You'll be great,\" Walter tells her. \"I'll be here if you need me.\"\n\nJust before Edna goes into surgery she tells Frank that if something goes wrong, she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life \"hooked up to a machine.\"\n\n\"So promise me that you'll do what I need you to do if the time comes,\" Edna says. \"And I want you to take that Alaskan cruise. Go see the Northern Lights for me and I will be there, with our ancestors, waiting for you.\"\n\n\"We'll go see the Northern Lights together,\" Franks says in response.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn surgery Edna suffers a hemorrhage and Maggie panics for a moment. Maggie was able to get the bleeding under control and get the tumour out, but until Enda wakes up they won't know her condition.\n\nEdna wakes up and speaks, and has her vision, as Frank, Sully, Cal and Maggie are by her side. A big relief for everyone at the Crossing.\n\nMorgan Kohan and Chad Michael Murray in Sullivan's Crossing Season 3 on CTV, CTV.ca and the CTV app, and streams on Crave\n\nFrom 'summer fling' to secret husband\n\nWhile much Episode 9, the first part of the Sullivan's Crossing Season 3 finale, was focused on Edna, Cal and Maggie's relationship is still on unstable ground.\n\nAfter the successful surgery, Cal overhears the doctor at the hospital tell Maggie that she knows someone at a Chicago hospital looking for a head of neurosurgery, and would love to pass along her information.\n\n\"How about I get back to you on that,\" Maggie says, as Cal watches from a distance with concern.\n\nCal brings it up to Maggie back at home and asks if Maggie is considering the job in Chicago, but Maggie says she was just being polite. Cal questions whether Maggie really thought about what she was giving up professionally when she moved to the Crossing, saying that it seems like she's missed her career a lot more than she wants to admit. Maggie is dismissive and walks away from Cal.\n\nSpeaking to her dad about what Cal said, Sully tells Maggie that he knows what it's like to wonder what your life could have looked like if you had taken \"another direction,\" addding that he doesn't want that to happen to Maggie.\n\nLater that night, Cal shows Maggie the letter he found in her books, addressed to her \"summer fling\" Liam, saying that she needs to put her career ahead of a relationship.\n\n\"I'm not that person anymore,\" Maggie stresses.\n\n\"I don't want to be the one holding you back from what you love, Maggie,\" Cal says in response, before saying that he's not going to stay at the house with her, so she can figure out what she wants without him there.\n\n\"Can you promise me you'll never regret turning your back on your career? If you can do that, I'll stay.\" But when Maggie doesn't respond, Cal walks out.\n\nConfiding in Frank, Maggie says she misses being a surgeon and he tells her she needs to \"quiet her mind long enough to listen to your heart,\" to determine the right path.\n\nIn the season's final episode, everyone attends a party of the opening of Rob's (Reid Price) restaurant at the lodge, with Maggie and Cal continuing their conversation about where their relationship is headed.\n\nScott Patterson and Kate Vernon in Sullivan's Crossing Season 3 on CTV, CTV.ca and the CTV app, and streams next day on Crave\n\nAt the party Maggie discovers that Helen (Kate Vernon) has made a surprise appearance at the crossing. While Edna was in the hospital, Sully called Helen saying he can't go to Ireland with her, but they she showed up to try to change his mind.\n\nSully tells Maggie that it's time for him to let himself go in a new direction. Adding that he doesn't think there's any reason he can't love the Crossing, but also live his life and go to Ireland with Helen.\n\nThose were the words of wisdom Maggie needed. She tells Cal that being a doctor is who she is, and who she'll always be, but she's a Sullivan and the Crossing is her home, and both those things are important to her.\n\n\"I realized that it's not neurosurgery that I can't live without. It's helping people,\" Maggie says. \"And I can do that by staying right here with you and opening a general practice in Timberlake.\"\n\nBut just then, a man walks up to Maggie and Cal outside the restaurant. It's Liam, who checked into the Crossing earlier that day.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Maggie says.\n\n\"Is that any way to greet your husband?\" Liam says in response, as the episode comes to a close.\n\nSetting up for a messy start to Sullivan's Crossing Season 4.\n\nAmalia Williamson and Joel Oulette in Sullivan's Crossing Season 3, premieres Sundays at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CTV, CTV.ca and the CTV app, and streams next day on Crave\n\nWhere other 'Sullivan's Crossing' relationships stand\n\nWhile we've gone through the main sources of drama in the last two episodes of Sullivan's Crossing Season 3, it ends with a lot of other relationship questions as well.\n\nJacob (Joel Oulette) finds out that he won't be able to finish his Masters degree remotely, meaning he'll have to return to Alberta. Lola (Amalia Williamson) says they still have so much to experience in their lives and \"jumping into anything right now wouldn't make sense.\" Jacob is heartbroken and doesn't take it well.\n\nBut after giving it some thought, Jacob tells Lola that just because he's in Alberta doesn't mean they can't keep in touch, and they share a dance at Rob's opening party.\n\nSpeaking of Rob, romance is in the air as he's officially in a relationship with Jane (Cindy Sampson).\n\nBut things are still rough for Rafe (Dakota Taylor) and Sydney (Lindura). Their differing opinions on marriage prove to be a big problem, and could very well lead to the end of their relationship.\n\nThere's certainly lot of drama in Sullivan's Crossing as we wait for Season 4.",

    "text": "Jeff Hoffman of the Toronto Blue Jays walks off the mound in the middle of the eighth inning against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to go \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 with the walking wounded on the Blue Jays roster, though that would be a gross undersell of the team\u2019s season to date.\n\nStarting pitcher Max Scherzer is the most-celebrated and talked-about one given that, after a 74-game stint on the injured list with a vexing thumb injury, he\u2019s due to return to game action on Wednesday in Cleveland.\n\nAnthony Santander, the other high-rent off-season acquisition by the Jays, is the big dude rarely talked about now. Sidelined for 21 games with shoulder inflammation (and only vague speculation on when he will return), the former Orioles slugger is almost literally the forgotten man given the virtual invisibility of his first two months as a Blue Jay.\n\nBut given the sudden wobbles of the Blue Jays bullpen, the one absence that is perhaps most impactful is that of reliever Yimi Garcia, now missing 28 games (and counting) with what the team describes as a shoulder impingement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen the bullpen was humming, Garcia was better than the ideal setup man for closer Jeff Hoffman. The pair provided a dynamic one-two highest-leverage punch at the back end of the bullpen that were a clear strength of the team in the early going.\n\nGarcia didn\u2019t allow an earned run in 19 of his 21 appearances and none in his first 14 outings while pitching to a tidy 3.15 ERA.\n\nBut now with Garcia out and Hoffman struggling, there is at minimum a sense of disarray in the Jays \u2018pen and, at worst, serious concern for manager John Schneider\u2019s late-game options.\n\nHoffman, of course, was money in his early days with the Jays, seemingly easily validating general manager Ross Atkins\u2019 decision to move on from Canadian closer Jordan Romano. In the first month of the season, Hoffman allowed just one home run and owned a skimpy 1.17 ERA.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince then, there have been issues. His ERA in the interim is a shade over 9.00 and he has surrendered seven homers and nine walks. The latest blip came in Sunday\u2019s blown save against the White Sox, an outcome that was undeniably ugly but, in fairness, was caused more by Hoffman\u2019s fielding miscue than how he was operating on the mound.\n\nAfter the game, Schneider was adamant that the Jays \u201ctrust the (poop)\u201d out of Hoffman. That may be the case, but the longer Garcia is out, the more the concern about shutting down wins will heighten.\n\nThere is no precise timeline on Garcia\u2019s return, though Schneider said on the weekend that after throwing a live BP session at the team\u2019s player development complex, it\u2019s possible that he can begin a rehab stint in Dunedin early this week.\n\nOf course, the concern beyond that is that with a 34-year-old right arm with some miles on it, there is no guarantee Garcia will return to the form he was early in the 2025 season. Overworked early, the Jays are going to need him \u2014 or an arm like him \u2014 to be a late-inning force.\n\nThe underlying concern is that the workload Garcia endured due to the season-long rotation concerns wore him down physically. It\u2019s always a delicate balance for teams trying to win games in the now yet preserve arms for the long haul.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn a more bullish bullpen development, the emergence and sustained effectiveness of Yariel Rodriguez has been an important antidote for some of the other reliever struggles. It\u2019s to the point that Schneider trusts the hard-throwing Cuban in just about any situation. Rather than be a replacement for Garcia, the prospect of having three potent high-leverage arms is enticing, if it ever gets to that point.\n\nWhat unfolds with Hoffman and Garcia over the next five weeks no doubt will impact general manager Ross Atkins\u2019 trade deadline strategy. Starting depth is the bold-face lingering concern for the Jays, but bolstering the bullpen will be a priority as well. Any such pursuit would brings its own set of challenges, given that the suitors for relief help at the deadline will be deep.\n\nA return to health and sizzling form by Garcia certainly would mitigate some of the urgency on that end, however.\n\nIn totality, the high-profile Jays population of the injured list (add Daulton Varsho to the group) has been an understated part of the Jays season to date.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the case of Santander, it certainly seems that since being placed in the IL on May 30, he will miss all of June.\n\nGiven that he has returned to throwing but yet to hit, it\u2019s almost certain he will need a rehab assignment to get back into game shape. After that, the player we\u2019ve been told over and over again is a slow starter essentially will attempt to begin his season from scratch some time in July.\n\nAs the Jays enjoyed an off day Monday to lick the wounds from dropping two of three to the dreadful White Sox and prepare for a six-game trip, there is muted optimism on what Scherzer will bring, given that his thumb issues have been lingering for almost two years now.\n\nDesperate for at least one reliable starting arm back in the rotation, Wednesday is a big day in the overall picture of the Blue Jays season.\n\nSo too, we would argue, is whatever happens in Florida with Garcia, who could be a massive factor in the second half of the season.",

    "text": "Mitch Marner\u2019s Maple Leafs breakup: How it got here and where it\u2019s going\n\nNot long after he wore the Maple Leafs\u2019 blue and white for the first time, Mitch Marner summed up his first National Hockey League experience.\n\n\u201cI thought I could have been a lot better, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Marner said late on the night of Sept. 22, 2015, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, having just finished playing in his first NHL pre-season game. \u201cIt\u2019s the jitters I\u2019m getting out of me right now. I can improve out there.\u201d\n\nIt would be another 12 1/2 months before Marner earned the opportunity with the Leafs, in games that mattered, to start making good on those thoughts.\n\nNearly nine years beyond Marner\u2019s regular-season Leafs debut, the firm belief in every corner is that his tenure with Toronto is coming to an end.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSimply put, the regular-season magic that Marner often put on display was not matched, certainly not commonly, when the annual Stanley Cup tournament got underway.\n\nHOW DID HIS NHL DEBUT GO?\n\nWithin days of his skating in his pre-season debut with the Leafs nearly 10 years ago\u2014 and three months after Toronto picked him fourth overall in the 2015 NHL draft in Sunrise, Fla. \u2014 Marner was returned to the London Knights, deemed too green to make an impact in the NHL.\n\nAt the age of 18, Marner enjoyed a dream season in what would be his final Ontario Hockey League year, becoming just the second player (Brad Richards in 2000 with Rimouski was the first) to win the Memorial Cup, the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy (Memorial Cup MVP), be named Canadian Hockey League player of the year, win league MVP honours, and win his league\u2019s playoff MVP award in the same season. No player has done it since.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much doubt as to whether Marner would crack the Leafs roster coming out of training camp in 2016. Along with Auston Matthews and William Nylander, who played in 22 games with the Leafs in the previous season, Toronto\u2019s young core was set to start showing the city and the rest of the hockey world its collective potential.\n\nLeafs\u2019 Mitch Marner walks into the dressing room during prospect camp at the MasterCard Centre in 2015.\n\nThe pre-season games aside, Marner\u2019s real-life NHL debut isn\u2019t remembered by many people outside of his immediate family. That\u2019s not because of what Marner did or didn\u2019t do, though he didn\u2019t have a point in Ottawa against the Senators on Oct. 12, 2016, when the Leafs kicked off their regular season.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was all about Matthews, who didn\u2019t so much as overshadow everything else that night as much as he obliterated everything else: His four goals in his first game set the modern-day mark for an NHL debut and dominated hockey discussion in the days to come.\n\nPeer a little closer at the game sheet from that night and see what Marner did. Skating on a line with Tyler Bozak and James van Riemsdyk, Marner had six shots on goal and 11 attempts, and his two takeaways (along with Matthews, the most in the game on either team) served notice as to the cerebral defensive stalwart that Marner eventually would become.\n\nMarner\u2019s first NHL point \u2014 a goal \u2014 came in his home debut three nights later against the Boston Bruins. After taking a pass from Bozak in the neutral zone, Marner shot past the outstretched stick of future teammate Brandon Carlo (playing in his second NHL game) and beat Bruins goalie Anton Khudobin with a quick strike to the outside.\n\nScored at 11:56 of first period, the goal stood as the winner in a 4-1 Leafs victory.\n\nWILL MARNER\u2019S NO. 16 EVER BE RETIRED?\n\nLeafs royalty was in the building, then known as the Air Canada Centre, that night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn one of the more momentous occasions during his now-completed time as Leafs president, Brendan Shanahan announced at a pre-game reception that all Leafs players with an honoured number were going to have them retired that evening.\n\nAmong those on the ice for the ceremony were Dave Keon, Darryl Sittler, Wendel Clark, Doug Gilmour, George Armstrong, Johnny Bower, Red Kelly, Borje Salming and Johnny Bower.\n\nWhether you were in the crowd at the rink or watching at home, you might have wondered whether Marner, Matthews or Nylander would one day join that special group and gaze upward as his number was raised into the rafters.\n\nWe suppose you could make an argument that it could happen for any of the three. Matthews and Nylander have multiple years remaining on their respective contracts and theoretically could one day help the Leafs win the Stanley Cup.\n\nDo that and, considering where they already stand among Leafs franchise scoring leaders (Matthews is sixth, 14 points behind Marner, and Nylander ninth), we\u2019ll probably see Nos. 34 and 88 retired somewhere down the road.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor Marner, though, any such recognition would have to be based on what he accomplished in the past nine regular seasons. We\u2019re not sure what he has done in the regular season would be enough.\n\nWe speak in the past tense for a good reason.\n\nANY CHANCE HE RE-SIGNS WITH LEAFS?\n\nWith July 1 and NHL free agency creeping closer, there have not been serious contract talks between the Leafs and Marner\u2019s agent, Darren Ferris.\n\nIt was Marner\u2019s choice to not hold discussions during the season and little has been discussed between the sides since the Leafs were eliminated by the Florida Panthers in Game 7 of the second round.\n\nThe Leafs will have the opportunity to make a pitch to Marner, but if they choose to do so, it might not make much of a difference.\n\nMarner\u2019s next game at Scotiabank Arena \u2014 we\u2019re 99.99% confident in saying \u2014 will be in the uniform of the Leafs\u2019 opposition that night.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs\u2019 Mitch Marner skates during a game this past season.\n\nHad Marner said at season\u2019s end that his priority was to re-sign with the Leafs, we would be in a different spot here.\n\nMarner hasn\u2019t told the Leafs he absolutely is not coming back to Toronto. But in having not talked contract with the Leafs, that\u2019s probably not necessary.\n\nOn May 20, in the players\u2019 final media availability before scattering for the off-season, Marner said he had not yet given much thought to his hockey future. A year earlier, looking ahead to his contract season, Marner had a different tune, saying at the time \u201cit means the world\u201d to be a Maple Leaf and \u201cwe\u2019re looked upon kind of gods here, to be honest.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Marner\u2019s claim last month that he had not pondered what comes next for him was a stark departure from everything he had been saying for years \u2014 that he loved playing in his hometown and loved all that was part of being a Maple Leaf.\n\nWhen general manager Brad Treliving said to media days later that a DNA change was needed in the group, it didn\u2019t require the knowledge of a hockey expert to figure that Marner would have to be part of that equation.\n\nJust Marner\u2019s luck, too: Considering the failure of the core to produce anything resembling a healthy run in any recent playoff year, it could have been the deletion of Matthews or Nylander from the roster that might result in a DNA change. It\u2019s Marner\u2019s contract that is expiring, however.\n\nHow the Leafs undergo a necessary DNA remodelling while keeping with Matthews and Nylander is in question. Apparently, a DNA change does not apply to John Tavares, whom the Leafs wish to re-sign before he hits free agency on the first of July.\n\nWHAT WENT WRONG IN THE PLAYOFFS?\n\nWhy it is that the Leafs and Marner are well down the path to divorce isn\u2019t because of mismanagement or failure on the part of the team to give Marner everything he required to succeed, which is no different than any other player.\n\nThe inability of Marner to match regular-season stardom and dominance with what he did in the playoffs is why we\u2019re here.\n\nMarner nailed it when he said after that first pre-season game years ago that he \u201ccan improve out there.\u201d\n\nIn the seasons that followed once his Leafs career got underway, he did improve. In a big way. Only Mats Sundin, Sittler, Keon and Salming recorded more points for Toronto than the 741 amassed by Marner.\n\nAfter knocking on the 100-point door \u2014 he had 99 points in 2022-23 and 97 in the season previous \u2014 Marner finally reached the milestone this past April 15, when he recorded his 100th point in a Leafs win in Buffalo against the Sabres. A couple of assists in the regular-season finale against the Detroit Red Wings two nights later at Scotiabank Arena later brought Marner to 102 points.\n\nAs Marner often went about bringing fans out of their seats on the offensive side, he developed into a fine defensive player during his Leafs tenure, putting himself into the upper echelon of 200-foot forwards in the NHL.\n\nFollowing each of the past seven seasons, Marner has factored in the Selke Trophy voting, finishing as high as third in 2022-23. This past season, he was seventh in Selke voting, done by the Professional Hockey Writers Association.\n\nHis smarts when he doesn\u2019t have the puck have few equals. Marner led NHL forwards in takeaways this past season and he led the entire league in that category two years ago.\n\nThe superiority never has translated into the post-season.\n\nMitch Marner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (right) and Evan Rodrigues of the Florida Panthers react after Florida scored its fifth goal in Game Seven of the Second Round of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs on May 18, 2025 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\n\nIt\u2019s not a high-stakes, high-pressure issue, either: Recall Marner scoring for Canada in overtime against Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off in February before setting up Connor McDavid for the overtime winner in the championship game against the United States.\n\nGenerally, players who wilt under the spotlight can\u2019t make those plays. They\u2019re not even on the team.\n\nInterestingly, Marner was not among Canada\u2019s initial six players announced on Monday for the 2026 Winter Olympics, despite his contributions at the 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to argue with the choices of forwards Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid and defenceman Cale Makar. As for perhaps wondering about forwards Brayden Point and Sam Reinhart, each has the experience of winning the Cup. Marner does not.\n\nIS THE GAME 7 JINX SENDING HIM PACKING?\n\nFor Leafs Nation, frustration amassed year after year in the playoffs in regard to the lack of production from Marner, Matthews and Nylander.\n\nMarner, specifically, has 63 points (13 goals and 50 assists) in 70 Stanley Cup playoff games. In six Game 7 losses, Marner has contributed a total of two assists and one of those came in the first one, in 2018 against the Bruins. In Game 7s, Matthews has three assists while Nylander has two goals and two assists.\n\nMitch Marner #16 of the Toronto Maple Leafs skates with the puck during the third period against the Florida Panthers in Game Four of the Second Round of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs at Amerant Bank Arena on May 11, 2025 in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nIt has become habitual for the Leafs, after their last game, to talk about how the experience would make them better, if not harden them, for the next occasion they found themselves in a tight playoff spot. But even in 2023 and this past spring, the two times that the Leafs happened to advance to the second round, carrying success any further proved to be an insurmountable challenge.\n\nTwo years ago, it was a five-game crumble against the Panthers; this year, it boiled down to Games 5 and 7 versus the Panthers, when the Leafs had their two worst playoff outings in the Marner/Matthews/Nylander era.\n\nThe failure on the part of the Leafs\u2019 stars has been collective.\n\nIn Marner\u2019s case, a salary with an average annual value of $10.9 million US for the past six years didn\u2019t fetch anything close to a satisfactory post-season return.\n\nSHOULD MARNER HAVE WAIVED NO-TRADE?\n\nThere has been the perception that what happened at the trade deadline in March might have ruffled Marner\u2019s feathers to the point that there was no way he was going to re-sign in Toronto.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure his thinking was that drastic, but Marner wasn\u2019t thrilled when Treliving asked him to waive his no-move clause to facilitate a trade that would have resulted in Mikko Rantanen becoming a Maple Leaf.\n\nMarner\u2019s camp wasn\u2019t happy about it. Treliving had to take his shot, though, especially with a player who didn\u2019t have any interest in negotiating during the season, not that it was mandatory for Marner to do so. And while Treliving did look into trading Marner last summer before the no-move kicked in, he did say in his post-deadline availability several months ago that \u201cwe\u2019re aligned with Mitch\u201d and \u201cwe want Mitch here for a long time.\u201d\n\nMarner, of course, declined. For those who have the idea that Marner owed it to the Leafs to waive, please produce the clause in his contract that required him to relinquish his no-move clause. Marner owed the team nothing.\n\nMikko Rantanen #96 of the Dallas Stars celebrates after scoring an empty-net hat-trick goal against the Colorado Avalanche during the third period in Game 7 in Dallas on Saturday night.\n\nWe\u2019ll never know what would have happened had Marner said yes and Rantanen became a Leaf and not a member of the Dallas Stars.\n\nThere\u2019s a conundrum with Marner, if you\u2019re one of those people who think the Leafs should do all they can to re-sign him.\n\nYou can\u2019t disregard the failure on his part to be a difference-maker in the playoffs. But you also know that, without what Marner has done in the regular season, the Leafs\u2019 potential for what they could accomplish in the playoffs would take a hit.\n\nIt just so happens, too, that Marner is about to go to market in a year in which the free-agent pool is not strong. With Rantanen having signed for the long term in Dallas, Marner stands alone in free agency.\n\nEven if Treliving was able to sign players who could significantly alter the Leafs\u2019 DNA \u2014 Sam Bennett or Brad Marchand, for example \u2014 there\u2019s no one available who will provide the offence that Marner does. And how will it impact the production of Matthews if Marner is gone?\n\nDOES HE DESERVE BETTER FROM FANS?\n\nThis conversation would be a lot different if the Leafs genuinely had arrived at the Cup doorstep in recent years.\n\nIf the Leafs won some of those Game 7s, had advanced to the Eastern Conference if not the Cup final, and been clearly on the verge of ending the 1967 drought, a lot of these words would not have been written.\n\nThat\u2019s not what has taken place. The Leafs have been just another team in the playoffs that can\u2019t get it together. They\u2019re not close to winning.\n\nThe electrifying, intense final between the Panthers and Edmonton Oilers was a reminder of the lengths that remain between the Leafs and the Cup.\n\nHaving said this, Marner hasn\u2019t deserved some of the public backlash that has resulted. When it has seeped into his private life, whether it has been the publication of his home address on social media (since removed) or other incidents of harassment, it has gone too far and is something no professional athlete should have to endure. It has weighed heavily into his decision to, in all likelihood, sign elsewhere.\n\nA Toronto Maple Leafs fan burns a Mitch Marner jersey.\n\nAs a lifelong Maple Leafs fan, Marner undoubtedly would have had a recurring dream as he grew up: Hoisting the Cup while wearing the blue and white of his favourite Original Six hockey team. Maybe, perhaps, after scoring in overtime of Game 7.\n\nThat wish became more focused when Mark Hunter, then an interim GM with the Leafs along with Kyle Dubas, stepped to the podium at the 2015 draft and said in making the Toronto pick, \u201cI\u2019m proud to announce, from the London Knights, Mitch Marner.\u201d\n\nIf, in the years that followed, you glanced only at Marner\u2019s regular-season statistics, you wouldn\u2019t have been at fault to assume that post-season achievements, individually for Marner and for the team, would have resulted.\n\nThat\u2019s not what happened. And now, we are in the midst of the final days of Marner\u2019s time with the Maple Leafs.\n\nFor the kid from Thornhill, this is not how it was supposed to end.\n\ntkoshan@postmedia.com\n\nX: @koshtorontosun",

    "text": "DEAR ABBY: I have hemifacial spasm (HFS), a relatively rare disorder characterized by random and uncontrollable spasms on one side of the face. HFS can sometimes be alleviated through surgery and/or treated with Botox injections. HFS makes social contact challenging when the face contorts for no apparent reason, sometimes with accompanying speech slurring.\n\nIn my case, surgery was unsuccessful, and my only option is Botox, which leaves one eye wider open and my mouth unable to move naturally or smile on one side. I\u2019m learning to accept this facial asymmetry as my new normal, but I\u2019m not there yet.\n\nI\u2019m self-conscious about having my photo taken, but camera-wielders insist and persist. Can you help me with a response I can use to those photo-takers who refuse to take no for an answer, or worse, tell me to \u201cjust smile,\u201d something I can no longer do? \u2014 SELF-CONSCIOUS IN THE MIDWEST\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDEAR SELF-CONSCIOUS: I have several suggestions about your problem. The first is that not everyone is equally talented in administering Botox. Is the person administering yours a dermatologist? Whether the answer to this question is yes or no, it might benefit you to consult more than one.\n\nBecause you are sensitive about having your picture taken, point out to the picture-taker that either you prefer not to be photographed, and why, or explain that you WILL NOT be smiling for obvious reasons.\n\nAnother thought: Consider positioning yourself so your more photogenic side faces the camera, as many celebrities do when they are asked to pose.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIDEO\n\nDEAR ABBY: My boyfriend embarrassed me when he told me to apologize to a woman standing behind him in line at the market. He was about to pay for the groceries when I said I\u2019d run to get an item I had forgotten. It took less than a minute, and the order was still being rung up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen I went back to include the item, he ordered me loudly to apologize to the woman standing in line behind him. Abby, he was still paying! She wasn\u2019t even in line when I went to get the mustard. Because he was still there, I thought he had told her he was waiting for me.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done something like this. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, and even if I did, he could have told me privately and not made me feel like a misbehaving child. I would feel different if we had left the checkout line, but he hadn\u2019t. I thought he was holding the line for me. \u2014 NOT A CHILD IN FLORIDA\n\nDEAR NOT A CHILD: If there had been a long line, I can understand that running back to fetch the mustard might have caused a serious inconvenience. Because there wasn\u2019t, your boyfriend should not have embarrassed you the way he did. Since it wasn\u2019t the first time he has done something like this, assume that he derives satisfaction from doing it. Think hard about whether you really want a future with a partner like him. (I know I wouldn\u2019t.)\n\n\u2014 Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

The teenage sensation is a known force in the pool and a flag-bearer for the next wave of athletes. However, behind every record-breaking swim and every gold medal clinched along the way is something deeper \u2014 a quiet, unwavering pride in being Canadian.\n\nHaving wrapped up a dominant performance at the Canadian trials in June, Summer now has her eyes set on the next big task \u2014 World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, kicking off mid-July.

    "text": "A view of an oil pump jack on the prairies near Claresholm, Alberta\n\nBy Amanda Stephenson\n\nCALGARY (Reuters) -Energy producers in Alberta, Canada's top oil-producing province, blew past the province's self-imposed limit on annual natural gas flaring in 2024 for a second year in a row, Reuters calculations show.\n\nLate last week, Alberta's energy regulator said it was ending the limit on flaring. Reuters is the first to report the change, which the regulator quietly published in a bulletin on its website.\n\nOn Monday, the regulator confirmed the removal of the limit and said it was responding to direction from the provincial government.\n\nOil production is booming in Canada, the world's No. 4 producer, which has been trying to diversify exports away from the U.S. since President Donald Trump took office and began imposing tariffs on many Canadian exports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCanadian energy companies hope Prime Minister Mark Carney will be more accommodative to the industry than his predecessor Justin Trudeau.\n\nA tally by Reuters of Alberta Energy Regulator data shows oil and gas producers in the province flared approximately 912.7 million cubic metres of natural gas in 2024, exceeding the annual provincial limit of 670 million cubic metres by 36%.\n\nThe province had exceeded the limit in 2023, with regulatory data showing total annual flare volumes of 753 million cubic metres that year.\n\nFlaring is the practice of burning off the excess natural gas associated with oil production. If the volumes of gas byproduct are small, and there are no pipelines nearby to transport the gas, companies often choose for economic reasons to dispose of it through flaring instead of capturing it and storing it.\n\nEliminating the practice would cut at least 381 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in environmentally harmful emissions released into the atmosphere, the World Bank has said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRyan Fournier, spokesperson for Alberta's Environment Minister Rebecca Shulz, said in an email that the province launched a review of its flare gas policy after the oil and gas industry exceeded the limit for the first time in 2023.\n\nHe said the province determined the 20-year-old flaring limit no longer served as an effective policy for reducing flaring and the ceiling did not account for increased oil production in the province or new emissions-reduction strategies.\n\nThe federal energy and environment ministries did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nAlberta's crude oil production set an all-time record in 2024 at 1.5 billion barrels, a 4.5% increase over 2023.\n\nA 2022 report by the Alberta Energy Regulator showed flaring volumes in the province have been increasing since 2016.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA 2024 report by the World Bank \u2014 which has been advocating for a global end to the practice of routine flaring by 2030 \u2014 found that flaring by oil and gas companies worldwide rose 7% in 2023 even as crude oil production rose only 1% over the same time.\n\nWhile flaring is better for the environment than some other methods of gas disposal such as venting, it still releases a variety of byproducts and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as well as black soot which can be harmful to human health, said Amanda Bryant, senior oil and gas analyst for the clean energy think-tank the Pembina Institute.\n\nShe said companies have alternatives available to them, such as investing in equipment that can be used to capture flare gases at site and redirect them back into production for use as fuel.\n\n\"Getting rid of the rule doesn't get rid of the problem,\" Bryant said in an interview. \"The role of a regulator really needs to be to prevent harmful impacts of industry and to ensure that our resources are developed responsibly.\"\n\n(Reporting by Amanda Stephenson in Calgary; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and David Gregorio)",

    "text": "The Liberal government appears to be backsliding on its promise to provide an immediate 20-per-cent raise to Canadian military personnel, instead now unsure of when that pay hike will come and how much it will actually be.\n\nDefence Minister David McGuinty told journalists June 10 that improvements were coming in military benefits, housing and health care. \u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of the initial investment will be, of course, including a 20-per-cent pay increase,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral hours later, the defence minister stated in another interview that the pay hike would be immediate. \u201cIt\u2019s about a 20-per-cent pay increase immediately for our members,\u201d McGuinty said in an interview with Newstalk 1010 radio.\n\nBut now McGuinty\u2019s office and the Department of National Defence can\u2019t provide a date for when the troops will see the raise on their paycheques or say whether it will actually be 20 per cent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe look forward to sharing more details in the near future,\u201d noted an email from McGuinty\u2019s office sent to the Ottawa Citizen by press secretary Laurent de Casanove.\n\nThe same statement about the pay increase also suggested that the hike might not come to a 20-per-cent across-the-board pay raise, but that figure represented instead an overall funding increase that also included retention bonuses and other initiatives directed only to specific military personnel.\n\n\u201cThis investment represents an almost 20-per-cent increase to the overall CAF compensation envelope and the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces are actively working on how best to implement this investment \u2014 looking at options that include a combination of approaches such as retention bonuses for stress trades, increased starting salaries for junior members and a broad-based salary increase,\u201d the email noted.\n\nMcGuinty\u2019s office did not respond to a request for clarification on whether the announced 20-per-cent pay increase was instead a boost to the overall compensation budget that also included retention bonuses and other benefits.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney announced a $9-billion spending increase June 9 that will hike Canada\u2019s defence and security budget to an all-time high of $62.7 billion annually by next year. The prime minister noted the salary increases, which he pointed out were well-deserved and would contribute to retaining personnel in the ranks as well as to attracting new recruits.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt a June 9 technical briefing that followed Carney\u2019s spending announcement, government officials noted it was expected that around 1,400 new staff would be hired at DND. More health-care workers will be hired for the Canadian Forces and the civilian workforce will be expanded so military personnel can focus on operations, government officials said at the technical briefing. Under government-imposed rules, the officials who provided the briefing cannot be identified.\n\nHealth-care workers in Canada are in short supply and there was no explanation on how DND would hire more personnel in this area.\n\nThe Ottawa Citizen asked DND on June 9 for a timeline on when the additional 1,400 staff would be hired.\n\nThe DND repeated the information from the government news release by noting that the public servants would be hired to fill existing gaps to support areas such as fleet maintenance, public affairs, internal service functions and digital and infrastructure requirements.\n\n\u201cThe intent is to fill as many gaps as possible this fiscal year, and we look forward to bringing further announcements as this initiative unfolds,\u201d stated the email from department public affairs official Cheryl Forrest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJune Winger, national president of the Union of National Defence Employees, said she had received initial information from DND that more civilian staff would be hired, but was provided with no specific details. But Winger noted that the department had faced significant barriers in getting new staff in place because of delays in completing security clearances. Such clearances are taking months and prospective staff, instead of waiting, are instead accepting jobs other than at DND, she said.\n\nThere have also been concerns raised about the retention of experienced troops.\n\nIn January, the Ottawa Citizen reported that military staff were recommending retention bonuses to keep key personnel from leaving the ranks, but there were questions at the time about whether the government would fund such a plan.\n\nDavid Pugliese is an award-winning journalist covering Canadian Forces and military issues in Canada.
