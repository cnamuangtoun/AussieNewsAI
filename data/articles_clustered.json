    "text": "Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment over his comments about a rival, Daniel Naroditsky, world chess governing body FIDE has announced .\n\nNaroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Centre on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n\nKramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n\nVladimir Kramnik attends an event in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2019. (AP)\n\nNaroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik's campaign had taken on him.\n\n\"The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\" he said , adding: \"The issue is just the lingering effect of it.\"\n\nKramnik has denied any wrongdoing and wrote on X Thursday that he hopes the \"real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead\" on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organisation \"thought that Vladimir's accusations were reckless and ungrounded.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity \u2014 in sports, in chess in particular.\"\n\nThis undated photo released by Charlotte Chess Centre shows Daniel Naroditsky playing chess. (AP)\n\nDvorkovich explained that \"any kind of sanction is possible\" for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n\n\"In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people's reputation but their very well-being,\" Dvorkovich said in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n\n\"When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks \u2014 a particularly serious concern in today's environment.\n\n\"The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.\"\n\nWhen contacted by CNN Sports, Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE's investigation as \"insulting,\" \"unfair\" and \"orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones\"\n\nHe added in the interview: \"The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.\"\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n\nSince Naroditsky's death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct \"horrible\" and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura describing his campaign against perceived cheating as \"nonsense\" and \"insane.\"\n\n\"It's time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,\" streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou wrote on X.\n\n\"Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.\"\n\nWithout naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin wrote on X that Naroditsky had faced \"relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations\" which caused \"immense pressure and pain.\"\n\n\"Daniel's smile faded after the attacks began,\" Sarin added.\n\nKramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a \"rapidly spreading desease (sic)\" in a \"fair play in chess\" fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n\nNaroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster \u2013 the highest title awarded by FIDE \u2013 before he was a senior in high school.\n\nA popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on his YouTube channel and 340,000 followers on Twitch, as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Lead,\" FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as \"a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.\"",

    "text": "A new report from property website Domain has highlighted the affordability gap in the Australian housing market, with would-be homebuyers increasingly abandoning their dreams of a freestanding house for more budget-friendly townhouses and units.\n\nThe report compared buyer searches in the 12 months to September 2025 \u2014 including location, type of dwelling, and upper limits on their desired price range \u2014 with the prices of homes listed for sale.\n\nWhile Australians' borrowing capacity has increased, population growth means homes remain in short supply, the report found.\n\nDetached houses \u2014 standalone residences \u2014 remained the \"most aspirational, but least attainable\", and the closer to city centres, the larger the disparity, it said.\n\nBut the report also suggested the traditional divide between expensive inner-city and affordable outer-suburban markets was becoming less black and white, with demand growing out from city centres and into higher-density homes.\n\nPressure highest in inner city\n\nHouses in the inner ring of cities were priced way above buyers' search budgets, Domain said in the report.\n\nBuilders report 'green shoots' The building industry is reporting a lift in approvals and new home sales, but says planning delays and skilled labour shortages are holding back construction.\n\nThe biggest gaps were in high-value suburbs with \"limited stock, entrenched wealth and low turnover\", it said.\n\nCanberra was home to the largest chasm overall, with listings $712,000 higher than what buyers were searching for \u2014 \"a reflection of limited supply and premium detached housing stock in a compact market\".\n\nSydney, Melbourne and Brisbane came next, each showing inner-ring gaps of around $300,000.\n\nMoreover, Sydney's eastern suburbs recorded a whopping price gap of $2 million.\n\nThe disparities were much smaller in Adelaide, Hobart and Perth, where buyers were much more likely to find their desired house within $75,000 of their budget.\n\nBridging the 'missing middle'\n\nAs buyers dreaming of a detached house are priced out of their aspirations, the Domain report found medium-density housing had become \"the bridge between space and affordability\".\n\nIt was this kind of housing that had been touted as one solution to the housing crisis, it said.\n\nHouses in the inner ring of cities are priced way above buyers' search budgets, the report finds. (AAP: Jono Searle)\n\nAccording to Domain, townhouses recorded the smallest misalignment between buyers' budgets and reality, with new medium-density supply \"bringing price alignment to the middle and outer rings\".\n\nIt found that in most capitals, townhouse prices were within 5 to 10 per cent of buyer search medians through the middle and outer rings, reflecting \"a growing balance between supply and demand\".\n\nSydney and Melbourne were exceptions, with listings consistently priced above buyer searches due to higher land costs, limited supply and strong demand from downsizers.\n\nThe report noted policymakers should take heed of \"the growing importance of medium-density supply in maintaining balance across urban markets\".\n\n\" For developers and vendors, they underline a market \u2026 increasingly defined not by scarcity alone, but by how closely new stock meets the budgets, locations and lifestyles that buyers are already searching for. \"\n\nIt comes after a push by the Grattan Institute to allow three-storey unit blocks and townhouses to be allowed on all residential land in Australian cities, declaring our cities some of the least dense in the world.\n\nGrattan housing program director Brendan Coates argued, \"the equation is simple: If we build more homes where people most want to live, housing will be cheaper and our cities will be wealthier, healthier, and more vibrant\".\n\nUnit is a buyer's market\n\nThe report also showed a growing acceptance of apartment living across Australia as people \u2014 by choice or otherwise \u2014 downsize.\n\nUnlike detached homes, Domain search budgets for units matched or exceeded median listed prices across most capital cities \u2014 bar Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nHouse prices are accelerating again The nation has not yet embraced the idea that housing needs to be more affordable.\n\nIn Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin, buyers searching for units set their budgets at a median $50,000 above the median sale price.\n\nDomain has suggested that this represents two trends \u2014 not only are people turning to apartments after being priced out of more expensive types of homes, but they may not be finding units that meet their aspirations for location or quality.\n\nSome areas had negative price gaps \u2014 meaning buyers were searching in price ranges above what homes were listed for, according to the report.\n\nThese were mostly on city fringes, like Blacktown in Sydney ($100,000) and Wanneroo in Perth ($77,010).\n\nThere were also some anomalies in inner urban areas, including parts of Sydney's inner west and north shore that returned negative price gaps, which Domain suggested were evidence of \"vendor caution, or a skew toward higher spec properties\".",

The mine, as I understand it \u2026 is actually a viable business but it has a debt that it can't service. \"\n\nHe said he understood what the company owed other parties significantly outweighed what it owed the government, and climbed into the \"many millions\" of dollars.\n\nMr Mostogl also said he was not aware of a similar intervention by a government in the past, but that there had been \"close calls\" with other mine operators in recent years.\n\nThe company has been reprocessing material from the mine's tailings dams.

(ABC News: Mackenzie Heard)\n\nAlso speaking to ABC Radio Hobart, the Mayor of Waratah-Wynyard Council, Mary Duniam, said the council was unaware of the issues at the Hellyer mine before news broke on Wednesday.\n\nBut, she said the closure of the mine would affect the region's economy and the broader community.\n\n\"Our mining industry is the economic backbone of the western area of Tasmania,\" she said.\n\n\" Any closure, whether short term or long term, generates a negative impact on our local economy and the health and wellbeing of our local communities. \"\n\nShe said she was concerned about the possibility of workforce redundancies, and said residents of her municipality affected by this decision needed to be looked after.\n\nHellyer Gold Mines has been contacted for comment.",

It felt like I had to work myself into it but yeah, happy to score,\" Kerr told Disney Plus.\n\n\"Of course, I prefer to play more minutes \u2026 I feel like today was good. I had a few chances in the first half.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be back out here playing in the Champions League again with an amazing team.

    "text": "A variety of mango developed and grown exclusively in Far North Queensland will be available in supermarkets this summer.\n\nWhat is now called the Ruby Gold mango was discovered growing off the branch of a Kensington Pride tree on the Palumbo family's farm in Dimbulah, west of Cairns, sparking a decade of grafting and planting.\n\nJohn Nardi, business manager for tropical fruits with wholesaler Favco, has been working with the growers since he helped them identify the variety.\n\n\"It's just got a really good strong Kensington Pride-type flavour, which is what we all love,\" he said.\n\n\" [But it's] typically a bit stronger than normal Kensington Pride. It's a little less fibrous as well, so not quite as stringy. \"\n\nThe Ruby Gold mango has a strong flavour, similar to the Kensington Pride, and is less fibrous compared to other varieties. (Supplied: John Nardi)\n\nThe Ruby Gold variety has been officially registered with plant breeders and has its own Plant Breeders Rights (PBR) status, which requires testing to prove its difference to other mangoes.\n\n\"Typically [it] has a really nice ruby, maroon sort of blush to it, so it looks fantastic,\" Mr Nardi said.\n\nThis year he is expecting 15,000 trays of the Ruby Gold mango to enter the market after years of sales at a smaller scale.\n\n\"We're hoping that obviously these volumes will grow over the next few years, and we'll be looking at producing more trees and getting more growers on board with it in years to come,\" Mr Nardi said.\n\nThe \"blush\" on the mango's skin helps the variety stand out. (Supplied: John Nardi)\n\nSuccessful market trials\n\nMr Nardi has worked with Melbourne-based agent and Produce of Virginia director Peter Tran over the past two years to trial markets for Ruby Gold.\n\n\"When they mentioned that there was a new variety coming through the market that they wanted to try and trial in Melbourne I was more than keen to put my hand up and give it a crack \u2014 and lucky I did,\" Mr Tran said.\n\nHe has been bringing small amounts of the variety to independent supermarkets and retailers and said consumers had responded well.\n\n\"I was blown away by the blush on the skin, it was incredible \u2026 and once [I] had a taste of it, I was like, this is a winner \u2014 this can't be beat,\" he said.\n\n\"There are some things you just know as an agent \u2014 you know what will sell, what will do well, what will do badly \u2014 but this variety of mango when we saw it, we were like, 'Yep, that's a winner'.\"\n\nFifteen thousand trays of Ruby Gold mangoes are expected to be available this season. (Supplied: John Nardi)\n\nRuby Gold is being marketed as a premium variety and Mr Tran is keen to bring more of the fruit to his clients as the crop volumes grow.\n\n\"There hasn't been enough to supply \u2026 because the crop has been quite small,\" he said.\n\n\"Demand has always been a bit high and we're actually very excited to see a commercial crop coming out this season where we can supply in decent quantities for the independent [market].\"\n\nRuby Gold mangoes are likely to be available on the market by the end of November.",

It handed the Italian world number nine, drafted in as replacement for the injured Novak Djokovic, a thrilling victory.\n\nA win over Musetti in his final group game will confirm Alcaraz as the year-end number one.\n\nOnly if he doesn't win another match and Jannik Sinner, who beat Felix Auger-Aliassime in his opener on Monday, goes undefeated to defend his title, will the Italian stay number one.\n\nFritz, who lost to Sinner in the final last year, seemed set to spring a surprise when he blasted Alcaraz away 7-2 in a first set tiebreak.\n\nThe American also had break points in the second set as he pushed Alcaraz much harder than de Minaur had done, but he failed to take them.\n\nOnce he was broken for 4-2 down in the final set it was all over.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "An abuse lawyer has accused the WA government of hijacking a case of historical sexual abuse to \"clarify law\", instead of legislating it through parliament because it would be \"political suicide\".\n\nIn September, Dion Barber was awarded $2.85 million in compensation by District Court Judge Linda Black for abuse he suffered during the 1980s and 1990s while in state care.\n\nHe first reported sexual abuse by his stepfather at eight years old, and was taken away by the state.\n\nDion Barber was abused during the 1980s and 1990s while in state care. (ABC News: Cy Millington)\n\nMr Barber was then sent back to live with the same man, where he was raped and abused again.\n\nThe state of Western Australia is appealing the entire basis of the case, arguing government officials acted in good faith and were therefore \"immune from liability\".\n\nJuliana Fiorucci, a lawyer on Bradley Bayly Legal's abuse team, said the state was \"dragging Mr Barber\" through the legal process to clarify points of law for future cases.\n\nJuliana Fiorucci is a lawyer with Bradley Bayly Legal. (Supplied)\n\n\"If they want certainty on the scope of duty of care, or on the assessment of damages, then the state can introduce a bill to do that,\" she said.\n\n\" But it doesn't want to do that because that would be political suicide. Instead, it wants to try and get the judiciary to do its work. \"\n\nWA Attorney-General Tony Buti said the appeal was important for ensuring existing law could be interpreted correctly.\n\n\"We expect the clarification will help others in Mr Barber\u2019s situation to resolve their matters more quickly and without a trial,\" he said.\n\n'Impossible to disentangle' physical, sexual abuse\n\nThe appeal also argues Judge Black should have only considered the sexual abuse and not the physical abuse Mr Barber suffered when determining the state's duty of care, and this should have been factored into the amount Mr Barber was awarded.\n\nMs Fiorucci said the arguments, if successful, would limit the state's scope of liability in future cases about historical abuse and reduce potential compensation amounts.\n\n\"There is a significant interplay between physical abuse and sexual abuse \u2026 It's impossible to disentangle the two; a risk of harm caused by physical abuse is often an indicator for risk of harm caused by sexual abuse,\" she said.\n\nThe WA government has previously said Mr Barber would keep his $2.85 million compensation regardless of the outcome of the appeal.\n\nMr Barber's case against the state was the first to proceed to judgment since time limits were removed for historical sexual abuse victims to seek legal action.\n\nWA Attorney-General Tony Buti says Mr Barber's $2.85 million compensation will not be reduced as a result of the appeal. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nWhen asked on Tuesday if the state government was making it more difficult for abuse survivors to seek justice, Dr Buti said the government had a track record of delivering reform.\n\n\"It was this government that removed the statute of limitations in regards to sexual abuse claims,\" he said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for us removing that limitation, Mr Barber wouldn't have had the ability to go to court.\"\n\nMr Buti said he would not comment on the grounds of appeal as the case was before the courts.\n\n'Use your common sense'\n\nMr Barber said it was \"disgraceful\" to argue that government workers were acting in good faith when he was a child.\n\nState of WA to appeal abuse survivor's payout The State of Western Australia is appealing the entire basis of a judgement which awarded a Perth man nearly $3 million in compensation for abuse he suffered while he was in state care.\n\n\"You can't send a kid back to a paedophile and say it was out of good faith, use your common sense; of course something more was going to happen,\" he told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"They know they're wrong, but they don't want to admit it fully.\"\n\nMr Barber urged the WA government to take responsibility for past wrongs.\n\n\"They need to just make up for their mistakes and change it, instead of trying to change what they're paying and what they're guilty for, change the bloody system because it's not right.\"",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size There\u2019s no surprise about where Nicholas Sparks\u2019 latest novel has landed \u2013 number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in its first week of release \u2013 but there is about where it started. \u201cIt kind of came about as one of those funny Hollywood things,\u201d says Sparks. His 23 published novels and two works of non-fiction have sold more than 115 million copies worldwide and made him a brand name for a particular kind of romance. As a result, \u201cthose funny Hollywood things\u201d are both more commonplace for Sparks and of a different order than they are for most writers. Eleven of his books (including The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Message In a Bottle) have been adapted for the screen, for a collective box office of more than $US750 million worldwide. And that gives him entree to some rarefied circles. \u201cMy agent in Hollywood is good friends with someone at Blinding Edge Pictures, which is Night\u2019s company,\u201d he says, referring to M. Night Shyamalan, the prolific writer-producer-director of a string of movies dating back to The Sixth Sense. \u201cAnd I guess they were talking, and they said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get these two together\u2019.\u201d Though they\u2019re credited as co-authors, Sparks says Shyamalan wrote \u201cnot one word\u201d of the novel. Credit: Hachette In May 2023, Sparks visited Shyamalan\u2019s sprawling property in Pennsylvania. The pair had never met before, but after a few minutes of pleasantries, each pulled out a short pitch \u2013 \u201cfive to eight lines\u201d, Sparks says \u2013 for a story that they might co-develop. Settling on Shyamalan\u2019s tale, they then sat down to lunch (prepared by Shyamalan\u2019s on-staff chef) and spent another hour or so hammering out details: \u201cWho\u2019s the main character? What\u2019s the setting? What\u2019s he in town for? What does he do for a living? Maybe he\u2019s building a house for someone. Who\u2019s he building a house for?\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, says Sparks, \u201cwe separated, and I went home and I didn\u2019t hear from him for about 14 months\u201d. When Shyamalan finally did call in August 2024, it was to say that the story they had sketched out together was going to be his next film. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018OK, I guess I\u2019m going to write a novel\u2019.\u201d That novel was the just-released Remain, which is credited to Sparks and Shyamalan. Meanwhile, Shyamalan has just wrapped the film version, the screenplay of which is credited to him and Sparks, with Jake Gyllenhaal starring opposite English actor Phoebe Dynevor (Younger, Bridgerton). Phoebe Dynevor, who played Daphne in Bridgerton, stars in the film version of Remain, written and directed by Shyamalan. Credit: Liam Daniel/Netflix In truth, Sparks says, they each did their own thing with the core elements they had worked out together over lunch. \u201cHe didn\u2019t write one word of the novel,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was just doing the film, which included the screenplay.\u201d To the best of his knowledge, Sparks says, \u201cno other project has come together like this because most projects it\u2019s either an adaptation of a novel or it\u2019s a novelisation of a film. And this was not.\u201d Rather, he likens Remain the book and Remain the film to identical twins. \u201cWhat we came up with at that meeting is a single egg,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the egg splits, and imagine that the twins are raised by two entirely different fathers. I write the novel the way I conceive the story should be, and then he did the film the way he conceived that story. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of similarities, but of course there are also differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe novel itself is billed as a \u201csupernatural love story\u201d. It\u2019s about an architect, Tate, who is recovering from a bout of depression following the death of his sister. Visiting a picturesque town in Cape Cod where he\u2019s planning to build a house for a friend and his wife, he meets a beautiful young woman called Wren. There\u2019s something odd about her, though\u2026 Remain won\u2019t win any literary prizes, but it\u2019s a perfect synthesis of the storytelling approaches of these two outrageously successful creators. Romance and the supernatural ... you\u2019d swear they were made for each other. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in The Notebook, the first of 11 Nicholas Sparks stories to be adapted for the screen. Remain will make it 12. Credit: Melissa Moseley/New Line You\u2019d assume that it was he who came up with the swoony bits, Shyamalan with the spooky. But, Sparks says, \u201cno, not necessarily\u201d. They were both united on the theme of the novel, he says, \u201cand that\u2019s basically love can save you, and sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that can really save you\u201d. And while they get pigeonholed in their respective genres, \u201cit\u2019s other people doing the pigeonholing\u201d. Sparks delights in telling the story of how close they came to working together on the screen adaptation of The Notebook 25 years ago. The production company New Line approached Shyamalan to do the screenplay, \u201cbecause he had written a love story that made the rounds in Hollywood\u201d. This might have been the big break Shyamalan was looking for. But he turned it down because he was working on a project of his own \u2026 a little film called The Sixth Sense. One of the smash hits of 1999, the twisty ghost story was nominated for six Oscars in 2000, including two \u2013 as director and screenwriter \u2013 for the then 29-year-old Shyamalan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd when I started writing, the very first novel I wrote \u2013 unpublished \u2013 was a horror novel,\u201d adds Sparks. \u201cSo he started with love stories, I started with horror. Look at us now.\u201d Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Shyamalan\u2019s debut feature remains the highwater mark of his prolific career. When you\u2019re conceiving a story, are you thinking of it as building a product that you will take to market, or are you driven by a sense of \u2018I have a story that I simply have to tell\u2019?\u201d \u201cMuch more the former,\u201d he says, with not a hint of hesitation. \u201cWriting is not difficult. Writing well is difficult, and writing well for a mass audience is exceptionally difficult. And doing it over and over adds to that difficulty.\u201d If Remain is the example par excellence of the novel (and film) as product \u2013 the result of a pairing dreamt up by an agent \u2013 writing it was anything but formulaic for Sparks. \u201cIt was very difficult, I had to put that novel together in three months, that\u2019s about half the time a novel takes, and it had to have the same quality as a six-month novel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt meant early mornings and some late nights, and sleepless nights.\u201d To meet the deadline for Remain he had to put aside the novel he\u2019d been working on. And once he was done, it took a few more months to recover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI finished all the editing by April, and I don\u2019t think I got my writing mojo back until July,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a hard, emotionally and mentally taxing press to make that novel everything it could be.\u201d Loading Shyamalan\u2019s film is due in cinemas this time next year. That should give Sparks\u2019 book plenty of time to sit atop the charts and fuel interest in seeing how his co-creator has scrambled the egg. But let\u2019s not forget there were two eggs laid in that barn in May 2023; Sparks\u2019 story remains (so to speak) as a possibility should the pair ever choose to repeat this unlikely trick. Which rather begs the question \u2013 now you know what it\u2019s like, would you do it again? \u201cI would, but ideally with a little bit more planning and not such a tight time crunch,\u201d he says. The idea he brought to the table, he adds, \u201cis a good story, and it could be a really good film. I think it\u2019ll work, but we\u2019ll see. If he wants to do something different, we\u2019ll do something different, or if he doesn\u2019t want to do anything, and this is it, OK. \u201cThat was the neat thing about this project,\u201d Sparks adds. \u201cNeither of us needed the other in the first place, and it just became a joy to work through the project. We\u2019re actually very good friends now, so that was very much a blessing.\u201d Remain by Nicholas Sparks with M. Night Shyamalan (Hachette) is out now.\n\nAdvertisement",

Here he is on The Hunger Games: \u201cWhen you create a futuristic dystopia organised around a televised blood sport in which teenage gladiators are forced to fight to the death, you have either wittingly or unwittingly created a pretty nifty metaphor for high school \u2013 the battlefields of The Breakfast Club and Mean Girls made literal.\u201d\n\nAnd on Twilight\u2019s sexual politics, building on Bitch magazine\u2019s description of it as \u201cabstinence porn\u201d: \u201cThe books and the films \u2026 create a kind of fantasy safe space where sexual desire, especially female desire, is acknowledged and even tacitly celebrated, yet also held in check for the good of all \u2013 with the twist here that it\u2019s the boy who hits the brakes, acting as guardian of virtue rather than, per usual, the girl.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s observations like these that lend Handy\u2019s wryly titled Hollywood High \u2013 A Totally Epic, Way Opinionated History of Teen Movies its special spark. Tracking the genre\u2019s evolution across eight decades, he proposes that it has much in common with the western, noting how \u201cboth deal with the struggle to establish order and fairness in an indifferent world, whether the prairie or the high school hallway, where the law, if not absent altogether, is only what whoever has seized power says it is\u201d.",

And yes, there might well be a bit of yelling when three adults and three kids get together to judge the first Booker prize for children\u2019s literature.\n\nAbout time. This initiative, wonderful as it is, should have happened 54 years ago when British children\u2019s publisher Judy Taylor first proposed it. \u201cIt is essential that the best writers should be encouraged to write for children,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA Booker prize might well achieve that.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why her proposal never got anywhere, but hey, better late than never. And the aim now is subtly different. Maybe the best writers no longer need encouragement to write for children (that distinction has never bothered authors such as Salman Rushdie or Philip Pullman), but children need encouragement to read more than ever before. This is a time when their reading for pleasure is at the lowest level for 20 years.\n\nThere\u2019s a cute video on the Booker website showing young children in dress-up costume reading from adult books that have won the prize: it\u2019s a reminder that many kids can read adult literature, at least in part, and are more than ready to tackle books for their own age group.",

I told them repeatedly that I had not worked for the Mail.\u201d Elton John outside London\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice in 2023. Credit: Getty Burrows claims that Johnson and Waddell said newspapers \u201cdid not want the publicity or cost of a court case\u201d so would pay to settle claims, a pattern Waddell is said to have described as a \u201cperfect scam\u201d and \u201ca gravy train\u201d. Meanwhile, Johnson is said to have spoken a lot about Max Mosley \u2013 the former president of the FIA, the Formula 1 motorsport body \u2013 and the money he was pumping into his business and the investigations, claiming that \u201cthere was plenty of money in the pool and there was always enough money for the right witness\u201d.\n\nMosley, who won a privacy case against the News of the World after it exposed his sex life, bankrolled a number of phone-hacking cases against newspapers in the civil courts. Loading Johnson introduced Burrows to Anjlee Sangani, the solicitor who certified his disputed witness statement, and whom he says he met only twice. Sangani is instructed by Lady Lawrence, Sir Elton, his husband David Furnish and Liz Hurley in the Associated claim. When Sangani visited Burrows\u2019 house in early 2021, she brought \u201chundreds of pounds\u2019 worth of flowers\u201d for his house and a \u00a3200 bottle of whisky, he claims in his statement.\n\nShe allegedly told him to deal only with Johnson, who would pay him cash, and promised a regular monthly retainer. \u201cI would get \u00a35000 a month for working a couple of days a week, and if I had any cash expenses, I only had to ask [Johnson],\u201d Burrows wrote in the new statement.

She said that after the [News of the World], the main paper they were going after was the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday because they had the most money. \u201cShe asked me if I had done any work for the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday. I said no, I had not, but I had met with [journalist] Paul Henderson a couple of times.\u201d\n\nHenderson has denied commissioning Burrows, the court has heard. Loading A few weeks later, Burrows says he was summoned to a meeting with Sangani and Johnson in a London square, where they were joined by David Sherborne, the claimant\u2019s barrister. According to Burrows, Sherborne asked him about his investigative techniques and how much he charged for surveillance. In late 2021, Johnson is said to have told Burrows he had an idea for a documentary about the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence \u2013 the son of Lady Lawrence \u2013 and later asked him to go to Cyprus to track down one of the first CID officers on the scene, which he did.\n\nIn early 2023, Burrows heard that Lady Lawrence had brought a claim against Associated Newspapers based on evidence he had supposedly obtained from former police officers who had worked on the Lawrence murder investigation. Burrows contacted the Mail and wrote a statement dated March 2023, in which he categorically denied the claims made by Prince Harry and others, stating that he \u201cwas never instructed or commissioned by anyone at the Mail on Sunday or the Daily Mail to conduct unlawful information gathering on their behalf\u201d and was never asked to target any of the claimants. The claimants do not intend to call Burrows because he has withdrawn his co-operation. They instead intend to rely on \u201chearsay evidence\u201d in relation to his claims. Antony White, KC, for Associated, has applied to cross-examine the private investigator. He told the court on Tuesday that he wants to ask Burrows if he had \u201crecanted or disavowed his first statement\u201d. The new witness statement was made public after an application to the judge. It was lodged with the court as an exhibit to a statement by a solicitor instructed by Associated seeking permission to cross-examine him.\n\nSherborne did not oppose its release but asked that any reporting reflect his view \u201cabout the scurrilous nature of its contents\u201d. He described it as \u201ca grotesque inclusion which is meant to be an attack on parts of the legal team\u201d, which \u201csimply shouldn\u2019t be permitted\u201d. The claimants, who include actress Sadie Frost and former politician Sir Simon Hughes, have accused Associated of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, \u201cblagging\u201d private records and accessing and recording private phone conversations.

That is why I am here, I did not come for any other reason (to COP30).\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Metuktire is one of dozens of Indigenous leaders participating in the summit, with the key demand of having more say in how forests are managed worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith plans to pave a highway through the forest and news that a license has been granted to explore for offshore oil near the mouth of the Amazon River, he is urging President Lula da Silva to give legal protections to tribal lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI had spoken to Lula when we met before he took office and told him that it was necessary to demarcate indigenous lands so that my people, my relatives, could finally have their rightful lands. When he arrived at the Piaracu Village, I asked him the same thing and asked when these demarcations would take place. I had seen that in the region they had started clearing the demarcated areas. Demarcation is very important for protecting the lands.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite controversy over the decision to host COP30 in the Amazon, Brazil has focused on pursuing their Tropical Forest Forever Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the official website, the initiative aims to compensate countries for preserving tropical forests, with 20 per cent of funds reserved for Indigenous peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn day one of the summit, $5.5 billion was pledged, still far short of the $25 billion target set by Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz says Germany is on board with the initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGermany is willing to contribute to this initiative and we will contribute with a considerable amount of money. We have to do the final decisions in Germany.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt COP28 in the United Arab Emirates, the world agreed to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt COP29 in Azerbaijan, that pledge was largely ignored and fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered the delegations of almost every country at the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a push from some fossil-fuel reliant economies to remove renewable transitions from the agenda, COP President Andre Correa do Lago says this needs to be a COP of action, not just ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, this is a COP of implementation. I hope it will be remembered as a COP of adaptation, a COP that will advance the integration of climate, the economy, activities, job creation, and above all, a COP that will listen to and believe in science. And in that sense, thank you, president, for finding the ideal formula to define this COP, which is the COP of truth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs delegates enter discussions about what kind of commitments they'll make to reduce emissions, the lack of any official US delegates is likely to weaken potential agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the Trump administration's opposition to climate action, California Governor Gavin Newsom is among a group of US governors and mayors attending as part of an alternative US delegation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to delegates in Belem, he says the position of the Trump administration is not reflective of all Americans.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australia can reclaim a proposed Russian embassy site but will need to compensate the authoritarian state for cancelling its lease on the land.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Australia quickly passed laws to cancel Russia's lease on a plot of land where it planned to build an embassy a few hundred metres from Parliament House in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government claimed the site could pose a threat to national security.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia described the cancellation of the 99-year lease, which was granted by the Australian government in 2008, as a hostile action amounting to \"Russophobic hysteria\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took the fight to the High Court, arguing the laws were unconstitutional and there was no evidence the embassy posed a national security threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe High Court on Wednesday ruled in the federal government's favour, finding the laws were valid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it found Russia was entitled to compensation, with the government also required to pay half of Russia's legal costs.\n\n\n\nConstruction at the site stalled, but a Russian official squatted on the site to frustrate any Australian effort to reclaim it. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas No developments were completed on the plot, but an official squatted on the land after the decision to frustrate any Australian effort to reclaim it.\n\n\n\nASIO provided 'specific advice' about site\n\nTop lawyer Bret Walker SC, representing Russia, previously argued it was offensive to assume people would willingly give up their property without compensation because national security grounds were invoked.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited an army barracks as an example, saying the Commonwealth would be within its rights to acquire land around the structure to protect security, but would still be expected to pay the owners.\n\n\n\nSolicitor-General Stephen Donaghue argued the government had the power and authority to make laws stripping the Russians of their lease.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth also relied on \"specific advice\" about the nature of the construction that was planned and the capacity the site's location would provide the Russian mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advice from ASIO was not detailed in court due to public interest immunity protections.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation should not be paid to a nation \"for problems they cause themselves\", Donaghue told the High Court previously.\n\n\n\nWalker said it was \"really disturbing\" to propose the taking of land without compensation on preemptive national security grounds where no explicit threat had been proven.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said such a precedent was absurd and would mean \"everyone is to be regarded, until proven otherwise, a terrorist threat\".\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "You\u2019ve been through winter lurgies and escaped the start of spring free of hay fever. Now you wake up with a sniffle you can\u2019t seem to shake.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you know if it\u2019s hay fever, a cold, or something else? And how do these two different culprits cause such similar symptoms?\n\n\n\nHay fever is actually an allergy\n\nHay fever is an allergic reaction to tiny particles you inhale from \"allergens\". These might be pollen, house dust mites, or animal dander (dead skin cells).\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, the body won't respond to these harmless particles. But for some people, the immune system mistakes them for something dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have allergies, your immune system prepares a particular type of antibody, called IgE, to target the culprit allergen.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re next exposed to that allergen, such as grass pollen, your immune system quickly releases chemicals such as histamine, which contributes to an allergic reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistamine and other inflammatory substances that are released inflame the lining of your nose, eyes and throat. This causes sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, itchy eyes, feeling drained and having trouble concentrating.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistamine irritates the nerves in your nose, eyes and sometimes your throat or skin, causing the itch. It's your body's false alarm, thinking it needs to protect you.\n\n\n\n\n\nA blocked or runny nose can make breathing at night difficult, affecting your sleep, leaving you tired the next day.\n\n\n\nHow the body defends against a viral attack\n\nWhen you catch a cold, viruses enter your body via inhaled droplets or aerosols, landing onto your nose or throat. The viruses use the coating on their surface to attach and enter the cells lining your nose and throat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is where a cold virus can replicate, and burst the infected cells to spread and infect more cells in the vicinity. This causes the release of molecules that signal to other immune cells to come to the infected area, and fight the viruses.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the fight, chemicals including histamine (yes, similar to a hay fever response) and other chemical mediators are released, causing symptoms such as a stuffy, runny nose, sore throat, sneezing and, sometimes, a fever.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany respiratory viruses can cause cold symptoms: common cold viruses (rhinoviruses), coronaviruses (the non-SARS kind), adenoviruses and more significant ones such as the flu (influenza), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID (caused by SARS-CoV-2).\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The way we've treated severe asthma for the last 50 years could be about to change\n\nSo how can you tell the difference?\n\nWhile hay fever and cold viruses share some overlapping symptoms, one of the main differences is that, ironically, hay fever doesn't actually cause a fever, but a cold- or flu-like virus sometimes does.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther cold or flu symptoms not commonly seen with hay fever could include a sore throat, muscle aches and pains (particularly influenza), and cough with thick mucus (known as sputum).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if hay fever is associated with asthma, you might also have a cough and feel breathless.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling itchy \u2014 and itchy eyes in particular \u2014 is a prominent symptom of hay fever not commonly seen with colds.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration and triggers for symptoms can also be a clue. Cold or flu symptoms may resolve within a week or two, with the season typically peaking during winter.\n\n\n\n\n\nHay fever symptoms may last for the duration of the spring to summer pollen season (seasonal hay fever), or whenever the person is exposed to the particular allergen that triggers them.\n\n\n\nWhat do you need to watch out for?\n\nUntreated hay fever can have significant impacts on quality of life and performance at work and school. Symptoms can persist for months and recur yearly with allergen exposure, particularly grass pollen.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf hay fever occurs alongside uncontrolled asthma, serious complications such as asthma attacks may require hospitalisation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThunderstorms during high pollen counts can also cause \u201cthunderstorm asthma\u201d, even if you've never had asthma before.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV can cause complications for those with compromised immune systems, young children, pregnant women, older people and those with underlying lung diseases. Complications can include pneumonia (severe lung infection), bronchitis/bronchiolitis (inflamed airways) and even death, so early health care can be crucial.\n\n\n\nWhy you might get both at the same time\n\nBeing exposed to allergens can weaken the immune response in the cells lining your airways. This makes it harder for your body to fight off respiratory viruses, meaning colds can last longer and feel worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh levels of airborne pollen have been linked to more hospital admissions for asthma in boys infected with rhinovirus (a cold virus) and even to rises in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nPollen carries a variety of bio-molecules, each of which can directly affect the cells lining our respiratory tract, and possibly facilitate respiratory viral infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, other studies suggest hay fever might actually be a protective factor against severe COVID. This highlights how complex the relationship is between pollen, our immune system and respiratory viruses.\n\n\n\nWhat should we do to control symptoms of allergy?\n\nThe best way to treat hay fever symptoms is with a nasal steroid spray, or a steroid spray combined with an antihistamine. Oral antihistamines aren\u2019t as effective at controlling underlying inflammation as nasal steroid sprays.\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing or minimising exposure to allergens where possible can be useful. In Australia, daily pollen information can provide an alert on high pollen days.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting and further allergy treatment, such as immunotherapy, may be available with an allergy specialist. Immunotherapy is the process of \"desensitising\" the immune system so it\u2019s less likely to over-react to triggering allergens.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you also have asthma, see your doctor to review and update your treatment plan and preventer inhaler every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn behalf of Janet Davies, QUT receives competitive research funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australian Research Council, and the Medical Research Future Fund, as well as funding from Department of Health and Aging for the National Allergy Centre of Excellence.

    "text": "Key Points Industrial trans fats are mostly found in cheap, fried and ultra-processed foods.\n\nAustralia remains one of the few high-income nations without mandatory regulation of industrial trans fats.\n\nNutritionists say there are alternatives to these harmful ingredients.\n\nPotentially harmful ingredients are being found in products on supermarket shelves, researchers say, and Australian labelling laws mean they don't have to be disclosed to shoppers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of packaged food products on supermarket shelves could still contain industrial trans fats (ITFs) \u2014 which are linked to heart attack, stroke, and premature death \u2014 despite international efforts to eliminate what have been labelled \"incredibly toxic\" ingredients from the food supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Sydney-based George Institute for Global Health are calling for Australia to join countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom in limiting the use of ITFs in food products \u2014 something the Department of Health says it is considering.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir calls stem from an analysis of over 28,000 packaged foods and drinks from major supermarkets. It found just four listed partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of ITFs, while about one in seven contained generic vegetable oils where processing details were unclear.\n\n\n\nOf 561 products that reported trans fat levels, 181 exceeded the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended 2 per cent limit of total fat content, according to the institute's analysis. And among the 336 products likely to contain only industrial trans fats, 104 exceeded the limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This study shows that dangerous trans fats are still lurking in our food supply \u2014 and consumers have no way of knowing,\" lead author Dr Damian Maganja from the George Institute for Global Health told SBS News.\n\n\n\nWhat are industrial trans fats?\n\nIndustrial trans fats, created by turning liquid vegetable oils into solid fats, are most commonly found in cheap, fried and ultra-processed foods, Maganja explained.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that ITFs contribute to around 500,000 early deaths from heart disease worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n\nWhile some trans fats can naturally occur in meat and dairy foods, a process called hydrogenation, in which hydrogen is added to vegetable oils, creates ITFs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaganja said of ITFs: \"They only cause harm. They're incredibly toxic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said they are usually found in ultra-processed foods like some margarines, pastries, and popcorn.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrans fats are used in food products as they can extend an item's shelf life and are cheaper to produce than other oils and butter, he explained.\n\n\n\n'No health benefit'\n\nDr Evangeline Mantzioris, the program director for the Bachelor of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of South Australia, explained the health risks of trans fats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trans fats are in ultra-processed foods, which also means these foods are most likely also high in sugar and salt and other fats \u2014 a deadly combination,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trans fats have no health benefit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMantzioris said that trans fats are also bad for cholesterol health, and if people have pre-existing cardiovascular disease, either treated or untreated, it will worsen their health.\n\n\n\nProfessor Helen Truby, a nutrition expert at the University of Queensland and Monash University, told SBS that naturally occurring trans fats can also be harmful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trans fats are found naturally in some animal fats but regardless of their source have a similar impact on your health,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Important to note that trans fats are also created in cooking processes when some seed oils such as corn oil are repeatedly heated to high temperature: for example, if they are being used in commercial deep frying.\"\n\n\n\nCalls to regulate ITFs\n\nAustralia remains one of the few high-income nations without mandatory regulation of ITFs, and the WHO has a campaign calling to end their use worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States banned partially hydrogenated oils from its list of safe ingredients in 2015, and in 2019 the European Union introduced a mandatory 2 per cent limit on trans fats in food products.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaganja would like Australia to follow suit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Relying on the food industry to voluntarily reduce harmful ingredients isn\u2019t working in Australia. To truly protect public health, we need mandatory regulation,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A full ban on this single ingredient would offer the strongest level of health protection, be easier to implement and enforce, and align Australia with international best practice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that setting a mandatory national trans fat limit of no more than 2 per cent of total fats would be in line with WHO guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said the Australia-New Zealand Food Regulation System was currently considering restrictions on the use of industrially-produced trans fats in processed foods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA survey of selected foods and cost-benefit analysis are in progress, with advice expected to be provided to food ministers in 2026,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nWhat are the alternatives to trans fats?\n\nMaganja said that products that contain these oils can be made in ways that don\u2019t involve ultra-processing and ITFs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have been making meat pies for a very long time before having access to hydrogenated oils, and they somehow still managed to sell them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTruby said there are alternatives to ITFs and naturally occurring trans fats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are looking to buy an oil, then monounsaturated fats from olive oil are better for your health. Using oils from polyunsaturated sources such as sunflower, canola, or soybean are useful for dressings or cooking and baking at lower temperatures,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whole foods such as avocados, fish and nuts are also healthier choices for those trying to avoid trans fats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMantzioris said to look for products that contain less than 0.1 grams of trans fats per serve of product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ideally, your total intake of trans fats should be less than 1 per cent of your total energy intake, that is about less than 2.2 grams per day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is for general information purposes only and should not be relied on as a substitute for professional medical advice.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now therefore I, Sir John Robert Kerr, the Governor General of Australia, do by this my Proclamation dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Australia's 18th governor general, John Kerr, handing down the news that Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam had been sacked.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia's most dramatic constitutional crisis, Whitlam was dismissed on November 11, 1975, 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the shocking dismissal, Gough Whitlam stood on the steps of parliament house and delivered his own iconic verdict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well may we say, \u2018God save the Queen\u2019, because nothing will save the governor-general.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGough Whitlam remains the only prime minister ever dismissed by the Crown\u2019s representative in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo mark the occasion, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese delivered a condemnatory speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake, November the 11th, 1975 was not a constitutional crisis. It was a partisan political ambush. There was no real precedent and no legitimate pretext. The (Coalition) Opposition orchestrated a parliamentary gridlock over the budget and then secretly prevailed upon the Governor General to break it by sacking the Prime Minister. Sir John Kerr justified his actions on the basis of incorrect advice from Chief Justice Barwick, improperly given.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says the dismissal sacrificed conventions and institutions in the pursuit of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In truth, the Opposition had preyed upon John Kerr's desire to be at the centre of events, and they had cultivated his paranoia, his fear that Whitlam was planning to replace him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt an event in Old Parliament House, Anthony Albanese described Gough Whitlam as an inspiration, a once-in-a-generation leader who raised expectations about what a government could deliver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This building was where the first iteration of universal health care through Medibank became law, where the renewal of our suburbs and regions was put at the heart of national policy. This was where the first bricks were removed from the tariff wall, the first steps taken to land rights, where a new generation of Australians were given access to the life-changing opportunity of a university education, where the White Australia Policy was finally abolished, diplomatic relations with China first established, the Racial Discrimination Act passed. The family court and single mothers payment created and so much, much more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, like his conservative predecessor Billy McMahon, Gough Whitlam had found himself dealing with an obstructionist Senate, a global economic crisis and powerful vested interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy October 14th, 1975, three years after it was elected, the Whitlam Labor government had run out of money.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Rex Connor's secret attempts to secure massive overseas loans via a Pakistani commodities trader led to the Loans Affair, putting the government in deep trouble and leading to Mr Connor's resignation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened next was known to some as a Senate coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days later on October 16th, Opposition Leader Malcolm Fraser cited the scandal as justification for breaking constitutional convention, leading the Opposition-controlled Senate to block the government's supply bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernor-General John Kerr argued that a Prime Minister who cannot obtain Supply must either hold a general election or resign.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen came the deadlock.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Whitlam refused to do either, intending to \"govern on\" and wait for the Opposition to back down.\n\n\n\n\n\nSir John Kerr used his constitutional reserve powers to dismiss Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical journalist Niki Savva, who was there on the day, has told the ABC Kerr's actions were underhanded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What made it so much worse was that he deceived him...he did not forewarn him that it this a possibility that it was something he was considering.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis echoes what Professor Jenny Hocking found many years later in the so-called \"palace letters\" between John Kerr and the Crown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letters confirmed the Queen knew by September 1975 that Sir John was actively considering dismissing the Whitlam government, and had later dismissed Mr Whitlam without warning him, a major breach of constitutional convention.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Hocking won a landmark legal campaign to release the secret letters in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They just hadn't been examined, barely at all, and they were some really significant holdings that I think completely unravelled the story about the Dismissal that we've been told before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the question of foreign interference doesn't end there.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being elected in 1972, Mr Whitlam broke with tradition, critiquing Australia's allegiance to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical of the carpet bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and critical of Pine Gap, the C-I-A-run Defence base near Alice Springs, he led conversations around independent foreign policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of Australia John Menadue has told SBS Whitlam's position really upset the Americans, who called Australians \"peaceniks,\" and \"unreliable allies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just before Nixon was ejected from office, he commissioned the State Department and Defense Department in a special report on what their relationship should be with Australia, and it was a pretty brutal assessment. It was recently published in 2014 and in it, that memorandum said that they would seek to lessen ties with Australia, and if that didn't work, they would then propose setting the stage for an opposition victory in Australia. This was in 1974 setting the stage for an opposition victory in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing an inflammatory Whitlam speech accusing the CIA of financing the National Country Party led by Doug Anthony, US Secretary of state Henry Kissinger sent Australia a threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kissinger sends a protest to the American ambassador about these comments by Whitlam, and that was followed with the authorisation by Kissinger of a d\u00e9marche\u2014that's a protest to the Australian Government - sent to ASIO in Australia, and threatening that if this continued, that they would seriously consider breaking their arrangements with us on defence and other policies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis d\u00e9marche was sent three days before the Dismissal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have no doubt it played a major factor in the decision of Kerr finally to sack Prime Minister Whitlam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Menadue says Sir John was worried Gough Whitlam would sack him too, after dismissing the head of domestic spy agency ASIS Bill Robertson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think this was the final element that gave Kerr the reason, in his view, to push Gough Whitlam over the cliff.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Gough Whitlam's book, 'The Truth of the Matter', he cites former US President Jimmy Carter who apologised in 1977 for US interference in Australian domestic politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Whitlam later conveyed the substance of this apology to the Australian House of Representatives, where it is recorded in Hansard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Democratic Party and the ALP were fraternal parties. President Carter respected the deeply democratic rights of the allies of the United States. The US administration would never again interfere in the domestic political processes of Australia. It would work with whatever government the people of Australia elect.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australians born today in the ACT can expect to enjoy a longer life than anywhere else in the country, according to the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data released on Tuesday shows life expectancy remains unchanged in the 2022-2024 period compared to the previous three-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor men, it's 81.1 years and 85.1 years for females.\n\n\n\nThe effect of COVID-19 on life expectancy\n\nThe ABS calculates life expectancy on the average number of additional years a person of a given age and sex could be expected to live, assuming current age-sex specific death rates are experienced throughout their lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data shows life expectancy estimates based on deaths captured during 2022-24 in the height of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt includes data from 2022, when higher levels of excess mortality were recorded. The number of deaths increased by almost 20,000 from 2021, and COVID-19 caused over 10,000 deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographer Dr Sergey Timonin from the Australian National University attributed the lack of change in life expectancy to COVID-19. He said Australia was currently at the level that it was in 2021, right before a major drop in life expectancy due to the effects of COVID-19 in 2022.\n\n\n\n\"So life expectancy increased in those two years, 2020, and 2021, but on the contrary, it dropped dramatically in 2022,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we talk about all these three-year estimates, we should keep in mind that there were quite a lot of changes during this period, including the biggest drop that Australia saw in the 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they say that life expectancy hasn't changed at all between these three year periods, meaning, mathematically, that life expectancy in 2024 which we actually mostly interested in, is the same as it was in 2021.\"\n\n\n\nLockdowns restricted the spread of other respiratory viruses that many seniors die from, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Before 2022, during the lockdown period in Australia, life expectancy increased quite a lot, and it was definitely at their peak. What we see now is kind of recovery from this 2022 period,\" Timonin told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think if COVID hadn't happened the life expectancy at the moment should have been a little bit higher than it is now, just a little bit, but not dramatically. So it is more or less, let's say, on track.\"\n\n\n\nWhere can Australians expect to live the longest?\n\nResidents of the Australian Capital Territory enjoy the nation's highest life expectancy, for both males at 82.0 years and females at 85.8 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife expectancy was lowest in the Northern Territory for both men (77.0 years) and women (80.7 years).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the NT had the largest increase compared to the other states and territory on life expectancy, for both males (0.6 years) and females (0.3 years) in the 2022-24 period.\n\n\n\nCredit: SBS News Moreover, those in the capital cities had higher life expectancy compared to those in remote statistical areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was highest for both males and females in Sydney, particularly North Sydney and Hornsby.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife expectancy also increased the most for Tasmanian men in the state's south-east, and women in Sydney's west in Parramatta, Melbourne's inner-south and Western Australia's southern outback.\n\n\n\nHow does Australia compare?\n\nThree decades ago, life expectancy at birth was 75 years for males and 80.9 years for females in Australia. Nationally, life expectancy has increased by almost a year in the past decade, broadly,\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has the 10th highest life expectancy \u2014 behind Switzerland, Japan, Spain, Israel, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway.\n\n\n\nCredit: SBS News However, Timonin said this was not a \"fair\" comparison because it's comparing annual estimates of life expectancy for OECD countries with Australia's three-year average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And we know that 2022 was bad in Australia. So I don't think that this comparison is fair enough to talk about,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Two international airliners carrying hundreds of people narrowly averted disaster when they overshot a runway and took off just metres above airport workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth aircraft flew so close to an active Melbourne airport site that jet blast affected the area, a report says, resulting in a stress-related injury to a worker.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir flight crews were unaware the runway had been shortened by more than 1.5km for night resurfacing works, resulting in two near misses within a fortnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-300 first overran the runway that had been reduced to about 2km on 7 September 2023, when it took off, passing seven metres above the airport worksite.\n\n\n\nEleven days later, a Bamboo Airways Boeing 787-9 overshot the same strip and took off less than five metres above the night works' vehicles and personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach plane was carrying more than 200 people at the time.\n\n\n\n'Serious incidents'\n\nNo one was injured, but a worker reported that the first near-miss caused their vehicle to shake violently.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second incident resulted in one stress-related injury, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These were serious incidents,\" the bureau's chief commissioner Angus Mitchell told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In both cases, we had a fully loaded and fuelled aircraft with over 200 personnel on board coming within metres of fixed equipment on the ground and with works equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it was by luck in this case that we didn't have an impact.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could paying Australians for travel frustrations drive up airfares?\n\n'Workload and time pressures'\n\nAll crews had been notified about the reduced runway through flight notices and the airport's information service radio broadcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, crews on the two international airliners involved in the near misses had not identified the information due to \"expectations, workload and time pressures\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey consequently used standard take-off performance calculations, with reduced engine thrust causing them to overshoot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flight crews also failed to confirm the shortened runway with air traffic control, which in turn failed to challenge them.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fed up with flight delays? Passengers could soon get refunds under new scheme\n\nDispatchers, who brief flight crews, had noted the reduced runway but did not emphasise it because it affected the take-off thrust required, which is the pilot's responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To those workers on the ground it was a terrifying experience,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's why we've been so detailed in the investigation, but also in our safety recommendations to ensure that this type of thing does not occur, particularly in Australia, again.\"\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBoth airlines have updated their procedures to ensure that changes to runway distances are directly communicated to flight crews.\n\n\n\n\n\nAirservices Australia \u2014 in consultation with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority \u2014 is reviewing its air traffic control procedures as a result of the near misses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ATSB has recommended the International Civil Aviation Organization review air traffic control communication procedures to crews on \"safety-critical\" aerodrome conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international body has already committed to introducing additional highly visible signage to alert crews of runway changes.\n\n\n\n",

Settling on Shyamalan\u2019s tale, they then sat down to lunch (prepared by Shyamalan\u2019s on-staff chef) and spent another hour or so hammering out details: \u201cWho\u2019s the main character? What\u2019s the setting? What\u2019s he in town for? What does he do for a living? Maybe he\u2019s building a house for someone. Who\u2019s he building a house for?\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, says Sparks, \u201cwe separated, and I went home and I didn\u2019t hear from him for about 14 months\u201d. When Shyamalan finally did call in August 2024, it was to say that the story they had sketched out together was going to be his next film. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018OK, I guess I\u2019m going to write a novel\u2019.\u201d That novel was the just-released Remain, which is credited to Sparks and Shyamalan. Meanwhile, Shyamalan has just wrapped the film version, the screenplay of which is credited to him and Sparks, with Jake Gyllenhaal starring opposite English actor Phoebe Dynevor (Younger, Bridgerton). Phoebe Dynevor, who played Daphne in Bridgerton, stars in the film version of Remain, written and directed by Shyamalan. Credit: Liam Daniel/Netflix In truth, Sparks says, they each did their own thing with the core elements they had worked out together over lunch. \u201cHe didn\u2019t write one word of the novel,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was just doing the film, which included the screenplay.\u201d To the best of his knowledge, Sparks says, \u201cno other project has come together like this because most projects it\u2019s either an adaptation of a novel or it\u2019s a novelisation of a film. And this was not.\u201d Rather, he likens Remain the book and Remain the film to identical twins. \u201cWhat we came up with at that meeting is a single egg,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the egg splits, and imagine that the twins are raised by two entirely different fathers. I write the novel the way I conceive the story should be, and then he did the film the way he conceived that story. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of similarities, but of course there are also differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe novel itself is billed as a \u201csupernatural love story\u201d. It\u2019s about an architect, Tate, who is recovering from a bout of depression following the death of his sister. Visiting a picturesque town in Cape Cod where he\u2019s planning to build a house for a friend and his wife, he meets a beautiful young woman called Wren. There\u2019s something odd about her, though\u2026 Remain won\u2019t win any literary prizes, but it\u2019s a perfect synthesis of the storytelling approaches of these two outrageously successful creators. Romance and the supernatural ... you\u2019d swear they were made for each other. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in The Notebook, the first of 11 Nicholas Sparks stories to be adapted for the screen. Remain will make it 12. Credit: Melissa Moseley/New Line You\u2019d assume that it was he who came up with the swoony bits, Shyamalan with the spooky. But, Sparks says, \u201cno, not necessarily\u201d. They were both united on the theme of the novel, he says, \u201cand that\u2019s basically love can save you, and sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that can really save you\u201d. And while they get pigeonholed in their respective genres, \u201cit\u2019s other people doing the pigeonholing\u201d. Sparks delights in telling the story of how close they came to working together on the screen adaptation of The Notebook 25 years ago. The production company New Line approached Shyamalan to do the screenplay, \u201cbecause he had written a love story that made the rounds in Hollywood\u201d. This might have been the big break Shyamalan was looking for. But he turned it down because he was working on a project of his own \u2026 a little film called The Sixth Sense. One of the smash hits of 1999, the twisty ghost story was nominated for six Oscars in 2000, including two \u2013 as director and screenwriter \u2013 for the then 29-year-old Shyamalan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd when I started writing, the very first novel I wrote \u2013 unpublished \u2013 was a horror novel,\u201d adds Sparks. \u201cSo he started with love stories, I started with horror. Look at us now.\u201d Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Shyamalan\u2019s debut feature remains the highwater mark of his prolific career. When you\u2019re conceiving a story, are you thinking of it as building a product that you will take to market, or are you driven by a sense of \u2018I have a story that I simply have to tell\u2019?\u201d \u201cMuch more the former,\u201d he says, with not a hint of hesitation. \u201cWriting is not difficult. Writing well is difficult, and writing well for a mass audience is exceptionally difficult. And doing it over and over adds to that difficulty.\u201d If Remain is the example par excellence of the novel (and film) as product \u2013 the result of a pairing dreamt up by an agent \u2013 writing it was anything but formulaic for Sparks. \u201cIt was very difficult, I had to put that novel together in three months, that\u2019s about half the time a novel takes, and it had to have the same quality as a six-month novel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt meant early mornings and some late nights, and sleepless nights.\u201d To meet the deadline for Remain he had to put aside the novel he\u2019d been working on. And once he was done, it took a few more months to recover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI finished all the editing by April, and I don\u2019t think I got my writing mojo back until July,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a hard, emotionally and mentally taxing press to make that novel everything it could be.\u201d Loading Shyamalan\u2019s film is due in cinemas this time next year. That should give Sparks\u2019 book plenty of time to sit atop the charts and fuel interest in seeing how his co-creator has scrambled the egg. But let\u2019s not forget there were two eggs laid in that barn in May 2023; Sparks\u2019 story remains (so to speak) as a possibility should the pair ever choose to repeat this unlikely trick. Which rather begs the question \u2013 now you know what it\u2019s like, would you do it again? \u201cI would, but ideally with a little bit more planning and not such a tight time crunch,\u201d he says. The idea he brought to the table, he adds, \u201cis a good story, and it could be a really good film. I think it\u2019ll work, but we\u2019ll see. If he wants to do something different, we\u2019ll do something different, or if he doesn\u2019t want to do anything, and this is it, OK. \u201cThat was the neat thing about this project,\u201d Sparks adds. \u201cNeither of us needed the other in the first place, and it just became a joy to work through the project. We\u2019re actually very good friends now, so that was very much a blessing.\u201d Remain by Nicholas Sparks with M. Night Shyamalan (Hachette) is out now.\n\nAdvertisement",

Here he is on The Hunger Games: \u201cWhen you create a futuristic dystopia organised around a televised blood sport in which teenage gladiators are forced to fight to the death, you have either wittingly or unwittingly created a pretty nifty metaphor for high school \u2013 the battlefields of The Breakfast Club and Mean Girls made literal.\u201d\n\nAnd on Twilight\u2019s sexual politics, building on Bitch magazine\u2019s description of it as \u201cabstinence porn\u201d: \u201cThe books and the films \u2026 create a kind of fantasy safe space where sexual desire, especially female desire, is acknowledged and even tacitly celebrated, yet also held in check for the good of all \u2013 with the twist here that it\u2019s the boy who hits the brakes, acting as guardian of virtue rather than, per usual, the girl.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s observations like these that lend Handy\u2019s wryly titled Hollywood High \u2013 A Totally Epic, Way Opinionated History of Teen Movies its special spark. Tracking the genre\u2019s evolution across eight decades, he proposes that it has much in common with the western, noting how \u201cboth deal with the struggle to establish order and fairness in an indifferent world, whether the prairie or the high school hallway, where the law, if not absent altogether, is only what whoever has seized power says it is\u201d.",

And yes, there might well be a bit of yelling when three adults and three kids get together to judge the first Booker prize for children\u2019s literature.\n\nAbout time. This initiative, wonderful as it is, should have happened 54 years ago when British children\u2019s publisher Judy Taylor first proposed it. \u201cIt is essential that the best writers should be encouraged to write for children,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA Booker prize might well achieve that.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why her proposal never got anywhere, but hey, better late than never. And the aim now is subtly different. Maybe the best writers no longer need encouragement to write for children (that distinction has never bothered authors such as Salman Rushdie or Philip Pullman), but children need encouragement to read more than ever before. This is a time when their reading for pleasure is at the lowest level for 20 years.\n\nThere\u2019s a cute video on the Booker website showing young children in dress-up costume reading from adult books that have won the prize: it\u2019s a reminder that many kids can read adult literature, at least in part, and are more than ready to tackle books for their own age group.",

Meanwhile, Johnson is said to have spoken a lot about Max Mosley \u2013 the former president of the FIA, the Formula 1 motorsport body \u2013 and the money he was pumping into his business and the investigations, claiming that \u201cthere was plenty of money in the pool and there was always enough money for the right witness\u201d.\n\nMosley, who won a privacy case against the News of the World after it exposed his sex life, bankrolled a number of phone-hacking cases against newspapers in the civil courts. Loading Johnson introduced Burrows to Anjlee Sangani, the solicitor who certified his disputed witness statement, and whom he says he met only twice. Sangani is instructed by Lady Lawrence, Sir Elton, his husband David Furnish and Liz Hurley in the Associated claim.

I said no, I had not, but I had met with [journalist] Paul Henderson a couple of times.\u201d\n\nHenderson has denied commissioning Burrows, the court has heard. Loading A few weeks later, Burrows says he was summoned to a meeting with Sangani and Johnson in a London square, where they were joined by David Sherborne, the claimant\u2019s barrister. According to Burrows, Sherborne asked him about his investigative techniques and how much he charged for surveillance. In late 2021, Johnson is said to have told Burrows he had an idea for a documentary about the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence \u2013 the son of Lady Lawrence \u2013 and later asked him to go to Cyprus to track down one of the first CID officers on the scene, which he did.\n\nIn early 2023, Burrows heard that Lady Lawrence had brought a claim against Associated Newspapers based on evidence he had supposedly obtained from former police officers who had worked on the Lawrence murder investigation. Burrows contacted the Mail and wrote a statement dated March 2023, in which he categorically denied the claims made by Prince Harry and others, stating that he \u201cwas never instructed or commissioned by anyone at the Mail on Sunday or the Daily Mail to conduct unlawful information gathering on their behalf\u201d and was never asked to target any of the claimants. The claimants do not intend to call Burrows because he has withdrawn his co-operation. They instead intend to rely on \u201chearsay evidence\u201d in relation to his claims. Antony White, KC, for Associated, has applied to cross-examine the private investigator. He told the court on Tuesday that he wants to ask Burrows if he had \u201crecanted or disavowed his first statement\u201d. The new witness statement was made public after an application to the judge. It was lodged with the court as an exhibit to a statement by a solicitor instructed by Associated seeking permission to cross-examine him.\n\nSherborne did not oppose its release but asked that any reporting reflect his view \u201cabout the scurrilous nature of its contents\u201d. He described it as \u201ca grotesque inclusion which is meant to be an attack on parts of the legal team\u201d, which \u201csimply shouldn\u2019t be permitted\u201d.
