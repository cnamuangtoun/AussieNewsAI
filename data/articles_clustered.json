    "text": "President Donald Trump said the US would take control of Venezuela's massive oil reserves and recruit American companies to invest billions of dollars to refurbish the country's gutted oil industry.\n\nVenezuela is sitting on a massive 303 billion barrels worth of crude \u2013 about a fifth of the world's global reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nThat trove of crude will play a central role in the country's future.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the US will control Venezuela's oil. (AP)\n\nOil futures don't trade on the weekend, so the near-term impact on the price of oil is a bit of a guessing game, but Trump said the US would operate the Venezuelan government for the time being.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies \u2013 the biggest anywhere in the world \u2013 go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,\" Trump said at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nA US-led revamp could eventually make Venezuela a much bigger supplier of oil and could create opportunities for Western oil companies and could serve as a new source of production.\n\nIt could also keep broader prices in check, although lower prices might disincentivise some US companies from producing oil.\n\nEven if international access were fully restored tomorrow, it could take years and incredible expense to bring Venezuelan oil production fully back online.\n\nVenezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA says its pipelines haven't been updated in 50 years, and the cost to update the infrastructure to return to peak production levels would cost $58 billion.\n\n\"For oil, this has the potential for a historic event,\" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.\n\n\"The Maduro regime and (former Venezuelan President) Hugo Chavez basically ransacked the Venezuelan oil industry.\"\n\nThe Petroleos de Venezuela Bajo Grande Refinery at the Paraguana Refinery Complex. (Gaby Oraa/Bloomberg/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\nControl of Venezuela's oil trove\n\nVenezuela is home to the largest proven oil reserve on Earth, but its potential far outweighs its actual output: Venezuela produces only about 1 million barrels of oil per day \u2013 about 0.8 per cent of global crude production.\n\nThat's less than half of what it produced before Maduro took control of the country in 2013 and less than a third of the 3.5 million barrels it was pumping before the Socialist regime took over.\n\nInternational sanctions on the Venezuelan government and a deep economic crisis contributed to the decline of the country's oil industry \u2013 but so did a lack of investment and maintenance, according to the EIA.\n\nVenezuela's energy infrastructure is deteriorating, and its capacity to produce oil has been greatly diminished over the years.\n\nVenezuela simply doesn't produce enough oil to make that big a difference.\n\nOil prices have been in check this year because of oversupply fears.\n\nOPEC has ramped up production, but demand has fallen off a bit as the global economy continues to struggle with inflation and affordability after the post-pandemic price shock.\n\nUS oil briefly rose above $60 a barrel when the Trump administration began seizing oil from Venezuelan vessels, but it has since fallen to $57 a barrel again.\n\nSo the market's reaction \u2013 if investors believe the strike is bad news for oil supply \u2013 will almost certainly be muted.\n\n\"Psychologically it might give it a bit of a boost, but Venezuela has oil that can be easily replaced by a combination of global producers,\" Flynn said.\n\nVenezuela's oil potential\n\nThe kind of oil Venezuela is sitting on \u2013 heavy, sour crude \u2013 requires special equipment and a high level of technical prowess to produce.\n\nInternational oil companies have the capability to extract and refine it, but they've been restricted from doing business in the country.\n\nThe United States, the world's largest oil producer, has light, sweet crude, which is good for making gasoline but not much else.\n\nHeavy, sour crude like the oil from Venezuela is crucial for certain products made in the refining process, including diesel, asphalt and fuels for factories and other heavy equipment.\n\nDiesel is in tight supply around the world \u2013 in large part because of sanctions on Venezuelan oil.\n\nUnlocking Venezuelan oil could be particularly beneficial to the United States: Venezuela is nearby and its oil is relatively cheap \u2013 a result of its sticky, sludgy texture that requires significant refining.\n\nMost US refineries were constructed to process Venezuela's heavy oil, and they're significantly more efficient when they're using Venezuelan oil compared to American oil, according to Flynn.\n\nPeople drive by a highway past a damaged area of Port of La Guaira after explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard on January 03, 2026 in Caracas, Venezuela. (Getty)\n\n\"If indeed this continues to go smoothly \u2013 and it looks like a masterful operation so far \u2013 and US companies are allowed to go back and rebuild the Venezuelan oil industry, it could be a game-changer for the global oil market,\" Flynn said.\n\nTrump called Venezuela's oil business \"a total bust\".\n\n\"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping and what could have taken place,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies \u2013 the biggest anywhere in the world \u2013 go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" he added.\n\nIt is unclear how energy prices will be impacted by the US intervention in Venezuela.\n\n\"It all hinges on whether Venezuela defies the recent history of US-led regime change efforts,\" head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets Helima Croft said.\n\n\"President Trump signalled the US is back in 'nation-building mode', and that US companies will make the requisite investments to ensure the revival of the oil sector.\n\n\"I think we need far more details before we declare 'Mission Accomplished'.\"",

    "text": "\"Daunting\" is how actor Lila McGuire describes the lead-up to playing tennis legend, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, on screen.\n\n\"It was physically demanding, but I've never been so fit in my life,\" she says of her preparation for Goolagong, the ABC iview series based on the true-life story of the world champion.\n\nIt's not every day you're asked to fill the shoes of a two-time Wimbledon champion, so the self-confessed \"netball girly\", who had never played tennis before, got to work.\n\nThere was training with a tennis coach three times a week and numerous sessions with a personal trainer who specialised in high-performance sport. A dietician and physiotherapist were also consulted.\n\nBut the Whadjuk and Ballardong Noongar actor found her background as a Noongar dancer the best preparation of all, helping her \"step into Evonne's physicality\".\n\nLila McGuire says it felt \"incredibly surreal\" to be offered the role of Evonne Goolagong Cawley. (ABC iview)\n\n\"[Noongar dancing] is very much about inhabiting the energy of whatever animal you're dancing for [and] paying close attention to the way they're moving,\" she says.\n\n\"It was a useful skill in terms of translating how I move as Lila versus how I should move as Evonne.\"\n\nThe pressure of playing a tennis legend\n\nWhen McGuire first learned she would be playing Goolagong Cawley, she was \"awash with emotion\" and promptly burst into tears.\n\n\"It felt like I've been offered the chance for all my dreams to come true,\" she says.\n\nLila McGuire worked hard on the court to prepare for the role. (ABC iview)\n\nBut pressure wasn't far behind.\n\n\"For me, it was about remembering that she is human, just like the rest of us. And to not put her on a pedestal,\" McGuire says.\n\n\"She deserves to be on a pedestal, don't get me wrong, but in order to connect with her journey and her story, I needed to remember that she was just like me.\n\n\"She was a young Black woman in her time.\"\n\n'I was always going to be an actor'\n\nJust like Goolagong Cawley, McGuire grew up in regional Australia.\n\nToo young to join the drama classes offered at her local high school, and with no dance school or local theatre company to turn to, she spent her time watching movies and cartoons while dreaming about acting.\n\n\"Mob dancing\" as a child helped Lila McGuire embody the world champion's physicality. (ABC iview)\n\n\"When I was three, I was watching a movie \u2014 it might have been Moulin Rouge \u2014 and I just remember going, 'That's what I want to do. I want to sing and I want to dance, and I want that to be my job. I want to act and I want to perform,'\" McGuire recalls.\n\nFurther inspiration came from movies like Bran Nue Dae and The Sapphires (also directed by Goolagong's Wayne Blair).\n\n\"Seeing Jess Mauboy, Shari Sebbens, Miranda Tapsell and the OG \u2014 Deborah Mailman, who we love \u2014 on screen and being their excellent Black selves was so important for me growing up, just because I didn't have a lot of that representation on screen,\" McGuire says.\n\n\"Those movies that showed Black joy, as well as the challenges that we have to navigate in our daily lives, were incredibly important for me.\n\n\" I think that plays a large part in my desire to become an actor, so I could be that person for all the mob kids that need it. \"\n\nBut it wasn't enough to convince McGuire to pursue a career in acting right away. Instead, she worked odd jobs as soon as high school finished.\n\n\"I didn't believe in myself enough,\" she says, until the moment she applied to acting school.\n\n\"And that was that \u2026 I was always going to be an actor, and I just had to accept that for myself.\"\n\nEvonne Goolagong Cawley at Wimbledon in 1976. (Getty Images: Don Morley)\n\n'Dream, believe, learn, achieve'\n\nMcGuire might have felt pressure walking onto set for the first time, but for Goolagong Cawley it was simply \"weird\".\n\nDespite the surreal feeling of having your life story immortalised on the screen, the winner of seven grand slam titles says it's also a \"wonderful honour\".\n\nEvonne Goolagong Cawley after winning the women's singles final at Wimbledon in 1980. (Getty Images: Rob Taggart)\n\n\"It's been nine years, but we finally found all the right people to work on my life story and they're doing a wonderful job,\" Goolagong Cawley says.\n\n\"Through my whole tennis career, I never really watched myself. [This] will be the first time I'll have seen myself. My double, anyway.\"\n\nHer biggest hope for Goolagong is that younger audiences will be inspired by her story to follow their own dreams.\n\n\"I started with an apple crate board [as a tennis racket] and hitting for many hours against house walls, water tanks \u2014 any wall I could see,\" says Goolagong Cawley.\n\n\"My motto through my whole life has been dream, believe, learn, achieve.\"\n\n'Stories that navigate the beauty of our culture'\n\nLike Goolagong Cawley, McGuire is excited to see the project come to life and reach audiences, particularly the \"young mob\".\n\nMcGuire says the tennis legend's story is one she would have loved to watch.\n\nLila McGuire fell in love with the game of tennis while filming Goolagong. (Supplied: Ben King)\n\n\"Stories that navigate the beauty of our culture, of the hope we still have, our strength, [and] the more beautiful and magical parts of our culture,\" she says.\n\nMcGuire describes Goolagong Cawley as an incredible human forced to navigate the complexities of being the only Indigenous woman on the international tennis circuit at that time.\n\n\"What I want them to take away from this story is that you don't have to do it alone \u2026 Lean on your people,\" McGuire says.\n\n\"You can rely on your Elders, you can find peace on country, you can be vulnerable and honest with yourself and still stay true to yourself.\"\n\nWatch Goolagong tonight at 8.20pm on ABC TV, with all episodes free to stream on ABC iview.",

Follow live.\n\nThe country, however, sits on what is known as a \"heavy\" oil, as opposed to a \"light\" oil produced in parts of the Middle East.\n\nIt requires higher-level production to refine and use as diesel or asphalt.\n\nWhile the big oil giants can do this, they have been restricted from entering the country.\n\nAMP's chief economist Shane Oliver, who helps manage billions of dollars on behalf of the superannuation giant, said Mr Trump appeared to be playing a long economic game here.\n\nHe told ABC News that Venezuela had become inefficient at producing and refining oil and offered up only a fraction of the oil to the world that it otherwise could.\n\n\"It's pretty bold,\" Mr Oliver said.\n\n\"It looks like a grab for oil. [But it will] take years to ramp [production] up again \u2014 certainly longer than the US mid-term elections. So, it's a bit confusing.\"\n\nDonald Trump speaks during a press conference following the US's strike on Venezuela. (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst)\n\nMr Oliver said the US intervention in Venezuela was part of a long history of US meddling in foreign countries for strategic reasons.\n\n\"There's a history of the US intervening in Central and South America to provide political distractions,\" he said.\n\nAnd this weekend's military operations have been months in the making.\n\nLast month, Mr Trump announced a blockade of oil tankers entering or leaving the country.\n\nThe US also seized two cargoes of Venezuelan oil.\n\nIt lowered the country's exports in December to about half of the 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) it shipped in November.\n\nMr Oliver also pointed to other hints the Trump administration was looking further afield in terms of military intervention within oil rich countries.\n\nShane Oliver says Donald Trump appears to be playing a long economic game. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\n\"[Trump] said recently the US was 'locked and loaded' in terms of Iran,\" he said.\n\nIt follows the regime threatening economic protests across the country.\n\nMr Oliver said the US intervention in Venezuela was \"part of an effort to reduce the cost of living in the US\".\n\nRising transport costs have been a key contributor to inflation in both the US and Australia.\n\nTrump's attack on Venezuela has been months in the making While Mr Maduro remained publicly defiant in the face of US pressure to step down, in private he was taking measures to dodge a potential US strike.\n\nWhile the US intervention could see lower oil and petrol prices for Australian motorists, it has the potential to produce a short-term inflation spike.\n\nAccording to Reuters reports, several vessels that have recently loaded crude and fuel bound for destinations, including the US and Asia, have not set sail, while others that had waited to load have left empty, according to monitoring data.\n\nNo tankers were loading on Saturday at the country's main oil port of Jose, TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nA total suspension of oil exports, including tankers chartered by state-run PDVSA's main partner Chevron, could accelerate the country's need to cut back output at oilfields.\n\nThat is because storage tanks and ships used for floating storage have filled rapidly in recent weeks, according to sources and PDVSA's documents.\n\nOil futures do not trade until Monday, Australian time, and financial market participants are divided over whether there will be a spike or correction in the price of oil in Asian trade.",

I still can't get my head around it.\n\n\"On a surface that he thinks favours seam, he [Steve Smith] looks around and sees a spinner standing at mid-off and he thinks, 'That's not an option for me'.\n\n\"I look at things a little differently. In Test cricket, part of the playing conditions is you need to satisfy bowling 90 overs the day, so you need to structure your bowling attack to satisfy that criteria.\n\n\"Quite clearly the ICC doesn't care about over rates, and Ben Stokes and Steve Smith don't either.\n\n\"I may be in the minority, but a part of the strategy of a Test match is to average 15 overs an hour to get those overs in for the day.\"",

(ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\nDarwin River Dam began topping its spillway on New Year's Eve after the catchment received more than 200 millimetres of rain during December.\n\nPWC's senior water services coordinator, Danny Browne, said it was rare to see so much water so early in the season.\n\n\"I've been in this role for 15 years now, and this is the earliest I've ever seen it spill,\" he said.\n\nDanny Browne says the dam started overflowing at about 4pm on New Year's Eve. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\n\"It's also the fastest I've ever seen it come up.\n\n\"It's very exciting for us to know we're going into the new year with a reservoir full of water.\n\n\"It's good for our water security.\"\n\nMatt Bochow showing his daughter Matilda the brimming flood plains at Fogg Dam on New Year's Day. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\nEarly cyclone, monsoon fills dam\n\nMr Browne said the rise was largely due to Cyclone Fina dousing the region in November \u2014 one of the earliest recorded cyclones to impact the Top End in a season.\n\n\"In that 24-hour period, the dam did rise very quickly, about 800 millimetres,\" he said.\n\n\" So that was quite a milestone for me to see that rapid increase over a very short period of time. \"\n\nFogg Dam is world famous for its natural beauty which comes alive in the Top End's wet season. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\nHe said a monsoon system which formed in the territory over the week of Christmas also helped.\n\nWhile the wet season is traditionally the quieter time for tourism in the Top End, visitors and residents have been venturing out to see how the water's brought its national parks to life.\n\nAmong them, Marrakai resident Bevan Clancy visited Fogg Dam on New Year's Day.\n\nTop End sightseers have benefited from an unusually heavy start to the annual rainy season. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\n\"It's a lot better than normal. We usually get the late rains, but it's good to see the water levels up real high this early in the season,\" he said.\n\n\" It's good to see the country all green again. \"\n\nInterstate visitor Cheryl Lockwood travelled north to see her family over the holidays, and was among those lapping up the serenity at Fogg Dam.\n\nDarwin River Dam rose about 800 millimetres in a 24-hour period following Cyclone Fina.

    "text": "As another fire season kicks off, the ACT has a new tool in its arsenal to fight the threat.\n\nIt's not a new giant \"Elvis\" helicopter, or a fresh batch of volunteers.\n\nIt's one state-of-the-art recruit \u2014 artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt ACT Emergency Services Agency headquarters, fire tower operator Andrew Beer surveys the vast capital region ranges, via a remote video camera network dotted among the hills and valleys.\n\nWhen he describes the difference that AI tech makes, he uses phrases like \"major benefit\", \"really, really helpful\" and \"a great backup\".\n\nAI and fire towers are sharing the load when it comes to monitoring for fires in the ACT. (ABC News: Mark Moore )\n\n\"Once upon a time we had people in fire towers on high fire danger days\" Mr Beer says.\n\n\"AI works 24-7, so it's always there, it's never asleep and it's the first port of call to identify fire incidents.\n\n\" [The cameras] keep watch on the ACT and our surrounding areas all the time and we don't have to have people in towers, which is a risky situation. \"\n\nRohan Scott, the chief officer of the ACT Rural Fire Service (RFS), is similarly enthusiastic.\n\n\"The introduction of AI \u2026 is seeing significant improvements in the way we detect fire, but also how we then use that AI technology for intelligence gathering and real-time monitoring of a situation,\" he says.\n\nACT Rural Fire Service Chief Officer Rohan Scott. (ABC News: Toby Hunt)\n\nMr Scott said the first time the ACT RFS began experimenting with AI assistance was just prior to the tragic summer of 2019-20.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we had an incident with one of our fire tower operators, and the chief officer at the time decided to look at other technologies to improve our capability, but also make it safer for our staff, particularly when they're working in remote environments.\"\n\nHe adds that more recently, \"the AI is getting smarter and smarter as we use it.\"\n\n\"It determines now whether a fire is dust or whether it's fertiliser spreading,\" he says.\n\n\"Is it steam coming off a storm that might have passed? So as it's being used, it's getting a lot more accurate for us and our ability to make decisions in a timely manner.\"\n\nBut will it take the jobs of firies with decades of experience, decision-making and composure, that can only be learned on the fire front?\n\n\"It hasn't taken any jobs. What it's done is it's increased our knowledge and our decision-making,\" Mr Scott replies.\n\n\"AI is actually then giving us that reassurance and confirmation of our decisions and our commitment to those resources out on the fire ground.\"\n\nAlready here, and evolving rapidly\n\nBettina Konti is the interim director general of a new arm of the ACT public service \u2014 Digital Canberra.\n\nMs Konti says beyond \"garden variety\" uses such as ChatGPT or Google large language models, AI is being incorporated into various areas of everyday life.\n\nAnd she says that it's vital everyone has a voice in how that happens.\n\nChatGPT is being used in everyday life, as well as in professional settings. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\n\"Probably the simplest way I could put it is, AI is here. It will continue to grow and evolve, despite us and without us,\" Ms Konti says.\n\n\"So best let's get in and understand it, learn how to work with it \u2026 if there are adverse consequences that come from it, how do we stop that from occurring?\n\n\" But how do we then gain the benefits that it promises for the Canberra community? \"\n\nShe cites everything from fire safety, road monitoring, healthcare and education as areas where the ACT government has already incorporated some form of AI assistance.\n\nBut no matter what task AI is being used for, Ms Konti acknowledges that human oversight is crucial.\n\n\"It's really, really important,\" she says.\n\n\" It's also important to say right from the outset that we don't know everything and we're not always going to get it right. \"\n\nBettina Konti is the interim director general of a new arm of Digital Canberra. (Supplied)\n\nShe also makes clear that unquestioning faith in AI's power to solve big challenges is the wrong approach.\n\n\"We can't just implement an AI-enabled solution and just let it rip,\" she says.\n\n\"We need to make sure that on an ongoing basis \u2014 and this is probably one of the areas where we've got new kind of job types and new kind of roles emerging through AI \u2014 someone needs to monitor.\"\n\nAI in the healthcare system\n\nMs Konti says that AI has particular \"potentially out-of-this-world transformative\" potential for the under-pressure healthcare system.\n\n\"AI won't just be able to help in the administration and to reduce the burden of administration for our healthcare providers, but also it will help in actually being able to detect disease and those kinds of things,\" she says.\n\nOne specialist using AI is Purnima Bhat, a public/private gastroenterologist based in Canberra.\n\nShe says AI is an established tool in several areas of healthcare, including administration, note-taking and training.\n\n\"AI has just revolutionised what we're doing now for patient care in many ways \u2026 and it's improving day by day,\" Dr Bhat says.\n\n\" I think the best and greatest thing that's happened for us in AI is the advent of public detection systems. That's what's become the de rigour for colonoscopy now. \"\n\nDr Purnima Bhat, gastroenterologist and hepatologist at The Canberra Hospital (also Associate Professor ANU College of Health and Medicine). (ABC News: Adam Shirley)\n\nA colonoscopy practitioner needs to meet an Australian standard for detecting potentially harmful polyps and lesions, some of which develop into cancerous growths.\n\n\"We've set these detection rates above [the point] which we think you're safe to do colonoscopies on patients,\" Dr Bhat explains.\n\n\" And so in determining whether or not your quality colonoscopy is being delivered, these detection rates are really important. \"\n\nPut simply, using AI-assisted detection equipment increases competence.\n\n\"For early-career endoscopists, for people who are providing the general service but may not be in a high expertise setting, it's making them very competent and it's raising the floor for the average patient who's going to see the average person doing the procedure,\" Dr Bhat says.\n\n\"And it's made them safer and better.\"\n\nAI means 'we're doing our job better': doctor\n\nDr Bhat said that experienced, skilled specialists and nurses are still superior to current AI, and that it's too early to statistically say whether using AI tech is reducing colon cancer rates overall.\n\n\"But at the very least, we're doing our job for the patients better than we were before,\" she says.\n\n\"We're finding a lot more lesions. We are hopefully preventing a lot more cancers. I think the data is still not entirely clear if that's true.\"\n\nBut one consequence to the technology is that \"we're doing a lot more work,\" Dr Bhat says.\n\n\"That's the thing with medicine, right? The more you look, the more you see, the more you scan, the more you'll find.\"\n\nAI is being used to better diagnose conditions within the ACT health system. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nHowever, she predicts the future will be pivotal for diagnoses.\n\n\"The next-gen AI is going to be able to say, 'That's this kind of polyp. This carries with it an x-per cent risk of turning into something nasty. You better do something about it',\" she says.\n\n\"Or, you know, patients had 10 polyps, but they're all super low risk. He's going to be fine.\n\n\" When AI can help us to determine what kind of polyp it is, I think it's going to make a big, big difference. \"\n\nDr Baht is acutely aware of the concerns and questions regarding the use of AI in healthcare.\n\n\"One is that if you train with AI, are you going to have a generation of colonoscopists that don't know how to find polyps on their own? That's been a big question,\" she says.\n\n\"And I think my answer is, I'm not sure my kids can read a map \u2026 But we remember the day when you still have to look at the 'Refidex' to find where you're going and have one person read the map.\n\n\"Now we use our map system or whichever one we're on and it tells us where to go and how to get there.\n\n\" So we would never go back \u2026 and I think that that's the point with technology. \"\n\nAn education 'game-changer'\n\nAI is also influencing the ACT school system.\n\nStudents have been dabbling in AI to help with their assessments (without approval) for years, but the ACT education system is now at the starting line of incorporating approved AI tools for teachers and students.\n\n\"The student-facing platform that we have here in ACT government is Google. And obviously, Google has [AI assistant] Gemini,\" Ms Konti says.\n\n\"So there are considerations right now about how, not if, but how, we implement Gemini for students.\"\n\nGoogle Gemini is one of the many AI options available. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic)\n\nFor public school teachers, approved use of AI is here and now.\n\nThe ACT Education Directorate has confirmed to the ABC that AI has recently been approved for use by teachers across the public school system.\n\n\"Over the past 12 months, a range of AI tools have been trialled by teachers for specific use cases,\" the directorate told the ABC in a statement.\n\n\" Following these trials, the directorate has endorsed a tool for teacher use, with careful consideration given to security, privacy and the ethical application of AI in schools. \"\n\nAmaroo School principal Ed Cuthbertson has no doubt that AI has more benefits than drawbacks for teachers.\n\n\"It's just an absolute game-changer,\" he says.\n\nEd Cuthbertson High School Principal at Amaroo School. (ABC News: Adam Shirley)\n\nMr Cuthbertson explains that AI allows teachers to tailor any lesson, text or instructions to a diverse range of students.\n\n\"For example, our school here, we've got 45 per cent of kids from an EALD [English as an Additional Language or Dialect] background,\" he explains.\n\n\"You can say, I'm going to have this piece of work delivered at this level, this piece of work delivered at this level, and this piece of work delivered at this level. And everyone can engage with the text \u2026 as opposed to a teacher having to rewrite each level.\n\n\" And let's be honest, they're not going to find the time to be able to do that. \"\n\nMr Cuthbertson cites curriculum improvements and selection of elective subjects as other areas where the technology is having an influence.\n\nHe sees AI as giving teachers back the most precious of resources.\n\n\"Time is a huge pressure in teaching. And it [AI] also takes that administrative component, which can be slow and laborious, and helps speed that up as well,\" Mr Cuthbertson summarises.\n\nHe adds this can be a doubled-edged sword.\n\n\"When you find time, it's a vacuum and it fills with other things. And I just hope that \u2026 what it can become, is that it frees up time for the important to be preferenced over the urgent,\" he says.\n\nThe ACT education system is exploring how to best use AI in teaching. (Unsplash: Taylor Flowe)\n\nHe also understands the many concerns there are about the technology, including some raised in the creative and artistic world.\n\n\"I think my ultimate worry or risk is that it replaces thinking,\" he muses.\n\n\"It can do a lot of the doing, but it can't replace thinking.\n\n\"And that's where your job as a teacher is around, how do you stimulate? How do you allow kids to make that connection?\"",

Since 2019, the United Nations has marked the date as World Braille Day.\n\nHow Louis Braille invented so many symbols with just six dots\n\nLouis Braille wasn't the first person who invented a read-by-touch system.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, there were many raised alphabets developed in England and France by philanthropists and entrepreneurs.\n\nThese alphabets were large, expensive to produce and not particularly easy to read.\n\n\"[As a blind person], Louis Braille understood that you can deliver information with the least amount of dots underneath the fingertip,\" says Jordie Howell, a soprano and braille music transcriber.\n\nHe laid out the idea to transcribe words and music using the same combination of dots to convey different information in different contexts.\n\n\"One braille character can mean so many things,\" Howell explains. \"It can mean a musical note and tell you how to sing that note.\"\n\n\"[Or it can mean] a math symbol, a letter or a whole word,\" Howell says.\n\nFor example, the symbol for \"the\" is the same as the note A in semibreve and A semiquaver.\n\nLoading...\n\nIt's braille's greatest strength and weakness. Having the same symbol with different meanings in different contexts can be confusing for many learners.\n\nBut once learners get their head around this concept, braille can be life-changing.\n\nHow Louis Braille enabled blind musicians to pursue careers in music\n\nOne of the most significant opportunities Louis Braille has enabled is within the music world.\n\nLouis Braille was educated and later taught at the Institut National Des Jeunes Aveugles [National Institute for blind children] in Paris.\n\nIt's regarded as the oldest school for the blind in the world, and is still open today.\n\nIts founder, Valentin Ha\u00fcy, started the school after witnessing a group of blind children who were forced to play instruments in ridiculous costumes at a Paris fare.\n\nMusic education has been an important part of the school since its inception in the 1780s.\n\n\"Louis was a proficient cellist, organist [and pianist], so he had a great understanding of music,\" Howell says.\n\nUntil a few decades ago, many of the organist posts in Paris were held by blind musicians, including Louis Vierne, Jean Langlais, Gaston Litaize and Andr\u00e9 Marchal.\n\nVierne was a composer and organist at Notre Dame Cathedral from 1900 until 1937. He died at the cathedral's organ console during a recital.\n\nMarchal was an influential organ teacher, recitalist and improviser. He toured internationally, even visiting Australia in 1953.\n\nDuring this tour, Marchal improvised on music by Australian composers including Alfred Hill and Margaret Sutherland.\n\nMeet the choral director who uses braille music to conduct Conductor Julee-anne Bell uses braille music to teach singers how to sing their parts.\n\nHe also gave an impromptu recital for 2,000 school students at the Sydney Town Hall.\n\nLanglais, who died in 1991, was a composer as well as an organist and teacher.\n\nMany of his compositions, such as Messe Solennelle, are regularly performed in churches, including here in Australia.\n\nAround the world, other blind musicians are also using braille music to learn songs, compose and arrange music, conduct choirs and perform with bands and orchestras.\n\nHow braille music is different to print scores\n\nIn the classical music world where being able to read music scores is important, braille music is widely used by blind musicians to learn repertoire or parts.\n\nHowever, even with music notation and digital braille technology, there is no way for braille users to get instant access to print scores.\n\nIt takes a skilled transcriber like Howell to convert print music to braille because braille music is fundamentally different to print notation.\n\n\"While a print score is arranged vertically, a braille score is set horizontally,\" Howell says.\n\nProducing braille music takes time, especially for complex scores with a large number of notes and multiple parts.\n\nTo simplify the process, most blind musicians who sing in a choir or play in an orchestra opt to only get the part they have to sing or play.\n\n\"You only get a limited view of the score,\" Howell says.\n\nThis can disadvantage blind musicians because in professional situations, most musicians are expected to get information from the whole score.\n\nIn the 200 years since Braille devised his system, composers have also invented new ways to communicate through what they write.\n\n\"There are signs and graphical notations contemporary composers are devising that need [explanatory] notes,\" Howell says.\n\n\"It makes [the transcription process] challenging because there aren't specific [braille] signs to represent them.\"\n\nTo ensure that braille music remains fit for purpose, Howell has been involved in the International Council on English Braille.\n\nThe group comprises braille music users who aim to standardise the code worldwide.\n\nConverting music scores with technology\n\nNowadays, there is software and other initiatives to speed up the conversion process from print to braille music and vice versa.\n\nFree music notation software like MuseScore has incorporated a braille music feature into their program.\n\n\"It's still in the elementary stages of development, but their aim is to have a way of editing in braille and [enable] translation into print,\" Howell says.\n\nThe process uses a file type called music xml, which is a feature that can be used by most notation software.\n\nYou can then use other software or a plugin with a refreshable braille device to access the notes.\n\nThe technology has enabled some blind composers to share music with their sighted peers.\n\nBlind pianist Jann Rutherford blazed a trail for other women in jazz From a small town in New Zealand to playing in Sydney\u2019s jazz clubs, Jann Rutherford was a pioneer and role model for many.\n\nBut the challenge to make sheet music accessible is broader than mastering the braille music codes and speeding up the process with technology.\n\nThere isn't a standardised way to produce print scores in the community and across music publishers.\n\nSo, transcribers and braille music users also developed a guideline to make the music engraving process more accessible.\n\nBlind musicians, like Howell and me, hope there will be more collaboration between performers, composers, educators and music publishers to keep the music world accessible.\n\nSign up to the ABC Classic Newsletter",

    "text": "Nestled in the foothills of Australia's Snowy Mountains, deep in the bush, the air in Tumbarumba still feels a little crisp as the gates to the town's biggest event of the year swing open.\n\nA reprieve from the sweltering Aussie summer is part of the appeal for cowboys and cowgirls who have arrived for the bulls, broncos, and beverages with old friends at the 80th Tumbarumba Rodeo.\n\n\"It's the entertainment, it's the thrills, man against beast, woman against beast, it's just the challenge,\" said Tumbarumba Rodeo vice president Jeffrey Rial.\n\nOne fo the first Tumbarumba Rodeo committees. (Supplied: Jeff Rial)\n\nMr Rial's great grandfather was on the organising committee of the first Tumbarumba Rodeo in 1945.\n\nNow, it is part of his family's legacy.\n\n\"I came down here as a kid with my father, he did the same, my grandfather was involved with the original rodeos,\" he said.\n\nWhile the sport is more about thrills in 2025, with hundreds of competitors travelling from around Australia, the original 1945 rodeo served a crucial purpose \u2014 to raise money for the local hospital.\n\nBoth sides of Jeff Rial's family were involved in the rodeo from its infancy, including his maternal grandfather Kerry Dunn (pictured). (Supplied: Jeff Rial)\n\n\"A lot of things were donated there through this rodeo and it really kicked the hospital off,\" rodeo life member Dennis Lavis said.\n\nThe hospital is now funded by the New South Wales government, but the event still raises money for community groups and charities.\n\nMost recently, it was used to set up a bus for the local aged care home so residents could go on excursions.\n\nDennis Lavis is a life member of Tumbarumba Rodeo. (ABC Riverina; Jess Scully)\n\nMr Lavis said not only were funds still raised for worthy causes, but the quality of the event had improved every year.\n\n\"It's got a hell of a lot better,\" he said.\n\n\" It is important, we want to keep it going for our community and ourselves and everyone else. \"\n\nThe mini bull ride was recently introduced to the Tumbarumba program. (Supplied: Wendy Lavis)\n\nYoung blood\n\nThe rodeo now features junior barrel races and poddy calf events where kids can compete to get their best time or hold on the longest.\n\nAnd there are also plenty of youngsters lining up to take the reigns and ensure the event continues.\n\nTwelve-year-old Tegan Rial is one of them, following in her father and great grandfather's footsteps.\n\nTegan Rial is a fourth-generation participant in the Tumbarumba Rodeo. (ABC News: Jess Scully)\n\nThe fourth-generation Tumbarumba Rodeo rider took out the junior 12 and under barrel ride, a title her 11-year-old brother Archie was also vying for.\n\nShe said while beating him was a highlight, her family's connection to the event motivates her to keep riding.\n\n\"I don't remember meeting my great grandfather so having this connection to him makes me feel really proud,\" she said.\n\n\"All horses have a special place in my heart.\"\n\nTegan, Jeff, Archie and Sarah Rial help organise the Tumbarumba Rodeo each year. (ABC News: Jess Scully)\n\nAnd for dad and rodeo vice-president Jeffrey Rial, that special place in his heart is reserved for Tegan and Archie, who are already making him proud by carrying on the family's legacy at the event.\n\n\"There's no doubt a bit of pride, we have an original photo of the first or second rodeo and to have my kids be involved \u2026 there's pride of what's before them and pride for what is coming,\" Mr Rial said.",

(ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\nFor Lucy, the difference was immediate.\n\n\"I was really excited to learn better and also show all my friends, saying 'I've got glasses, I can see better now',\" she said.\n\nMs Thornley said her daughter's reading, writing and social skills skyrocketed.\n\n\"Her confidence went through the roof and then at school she was just a vibrant, happy little girl,\" she said.\n\nBut Flinders University researcher and optometrist Cassandra Haines said it could have been a very different outcome.\n\n\"If we don't detect this when children are young, it can lead to permanent blindness in that eye,\" she said.\n\nCassandra Haines says research indicates almost one in five children has an undiagnosed vision condition. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\nShe is one of a group of researchers and eye health professionals calling on the state government to implement a universal vision screening program for all South Australian children at preschools and day care centres.\n\n\"This proposal has the support of all the eye healthcare leaders in the state,\" she said.\n\nThe importance of early testing\n\nCurrently, free vision and hearing checks are offered to four and five-year-olds through the Child and Family Health Service (CaFHS), however, the researchers estimate only 40 per cent of eligible children are accessing the service.\n\n\"Recent research that we've been doing here at Flinders University has shown that 17 per cent of children had an undiagnosed vision condition \u2014 that's almost one in five children,\" Ms Haines said.\n\n\"A lot of other states in Australia have comprehensive vision screening programs where almost 100 per cent of children have their eyes screened before starting school.\"\n\nThe researchers estimate the program would cost about $1.1 million, and could be up and running as soon as 2028 with government support.\n\n\"We all know how important vision is for everything that we do, but it's so important for children, particularly as having poor vision can negatively impact their performance at school, but also it can negatively impact their learning and earning potential across the whole life span,\" she said.\n\nHayley McDonald says Lucy had early signs of a lazy eye. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\nIn a statement, a Women's and Children's Health Network spokesperson did not say whether the government would commit funding.\n\nBut, the spokesperson said CaFHS continued to work closely with kindergartens and early learning centres \"to maximise participation\" in the existing program among four and five-year-olds.\n\n\"Vision screening for children aged four years and under is vital for the prompt detection and management of childhood eye issues that can become untreatable and irreversible if not managed early enough,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Children identified with vision loss can be referred directly to the Women's and Children's Hospital from CaFHS (without the need for referral from their GP or optometrist).\n\n\"Alternatively, they may attend their local optometrist or may be referred to private specialist care by their GP or optometrist.\"\n\n'Nobody gets left out'\n\nMs McDonald said the free vision testing process was quick and easy.\n\n\"For the young kids \u2026 it's reading out some shapes on a chart, they definitely don't need to know their letters, and then using [a] machine that basically takes a photo of their eyes that automatically screens their glasses prescription,\" she said.\n\nHayley McDonald supports a universal preschool vision testing program. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\nShe said parents and children often did not even realise they had vision problems, which meant they could be easily missed.\n\n\"Finding it early means we can treat it effectively. The older they get, the more impact it has on their education and the less we can actually do about it,\" she said.\n\nMs Thornley said she was incredibly grateful Lucy's condition was picked up when it was, and has thrown support behind the universal preschool vision testing proposal.\n\n\"It's where you've got all the children together \u2014 nobody gets missed and nobody gets left out,\" she said.\n\n\" You love your children; you want to give your children the best opportunity in life \u2026 a simple little thing like this can give your child the best opportunity. \"\n\nFor Lucy, who is now 10 and loves dancing, playing and dreams of becoming a fashion designer, the experience of choosing glasses with her mum was \"pretty exciting and fun\".",

    "text": "We know Rilke primarily from the spacious majesty of the Duino Elegies and the personal mysticism of the Sonnets to Orpheus , sequences of poems written in highly charged free verse which are easily assimilated into English with adjustments according to taste in phrasing. What we tend not to know \u2013 or which we wrongly assimilate to free verse, distortedly \u2013 are Rilke\u2019s \u201cthing poems\u201d, his Dinggedichte , composed early in the 20th century. Now, Geoffrey Lehmann has translated them using a strict form which replicates Rilke\u2019s nine-syllable line. The upshot is miraculous. We feel we are reading a great poet without any diminution in formal power.\n\nThis book is a masterpiece, and it is made out of someone else\u2019s set of masterpieces. It is the translation by the octogenarian Australian poet Geoffrey Lehmann of a group of poems by Rilke, by common consent one of the very greatest poets of the high modern period, the figure in German poetry we might put alongside Yeats for grandeur and formal intensity and range.\n\nIf you are homeless, you will find no home.\n\nSolitary, you will remain alone,\n\nand wake and read and write long letters,\n\nand along empty avenues will roam,\n\nrestlessly here and there, as leaves are blown.\n\nThe formal brilliance of this is remarkable. We feel as if we\u2019re in an enchanted world where an early 20th-century poem has come into being through nothing but technical wizardry in service to a belief on Lehmann\u2019s part that the verse form will affect this extraordinary transubstantiation. No one would believe in the undertaking Lehmann has committed himself to, but it works. We believe this is Rilke, and it really is a matter of by their fruits shall ye know them.\n\nThe preoccupations of the poems can have their own paraphrasable interest \u2013 as in the version of one by Seamus Heaney \u2013 and, yes, in this form (which is a neglect of form) there will be the intrinsic interest of a great writer displaying his themes but not with this breathtaking inhabitation of the spirit that comes with the rhythm and the rhyme.\n\nRainer Maria Rilke\u2019s Elegies were described as \u201cthe greatest poem of the 20th century\u201d. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWe get biblical motifs, a young man looking at his face, its regularity and its ability to weather pain. There\u2019s the incomprehension in a crucifixion poem of the \u201cEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani\u201d cry of forsaking and the butcher boy, soldiers hoping for a show. There are various poems that make the Pieta primarily a landscape for Mary Magdalene. There\u2019s the poet\u2019s feeling for the sensuous figure of Christ.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo these are tiger nuts. Tiger nuts are not actually nuts, but they get called tiger nuts because they've got little stripes on them that look like tiger stripes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger nuts are in fact a root vegetable, each one the size of a chick pea. The nuts are used to make a plant-based milk, which is gaining popularity worldwide. Laura Hindson was introduced to the nuts by a relative from Mali, and quickly saw a business opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are a great versatile ingredient to make plant-based milk. Tiger nuts themselves are incredibly high in fibre. They're a good source of plant-based iron. They've got lots of vitamins, magnesium and potassium. So, they are quite a nutritious food source.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger Nuts were found in the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs and are a staple food in West Africa. Now, the rest of the world is catching on. Ms Hindson says demand for tiger nut milk is rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's quite unique, it's very creamy, very smooth, and it's slightly sweet ever so slightly nutty. Last year our business doubled every quarter, which was exciting and challenging at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a purpose-built factory in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, Ms Hindson\u2019s business called Madame Tiger can produce up to 40-thousand litres of tiger nut milk in a single day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we wash then we soak them to soften them and then we mill them with water and then we filter out any fibre that is left in the milk and then we blend it with the other ingredients and bottle it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\nMadame Tiger is changing the lives of more than 600 women and their families in Africa\u2019s Burkina Faso.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hindson explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we get our tiger nuts from a female farming collective in Burkina Faso called Mousso Faso. And Mousso Faso means land of the wholehearted woman. So, when we first met the collective, they'd been really mistreated and the pay that they were getting per kilo of tiger nuts was really not okay. So, we are paying about three to four times what they were being paid previously for their tiger nuts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBurkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf its almost 14 million inhabitants, only 22 per cent are literate, and life expectancy is below 62 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nFarming tiger nuts is exhausting hard work, mostly carried out by women who are vulnerable to exploitation, according to collective spokesperson Maria Marquez, who\u2019s based in Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the past, and this is not only happening with tiger nuts, but it's an example of what happens with sugar, with coffee, with cocoa, y\u2019know they are not fair systems for that people. So, they have been exposed to scams and to not fair commercial relations, and that has been real pain and a real hurt for those families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling tiger nuts to Australia for a fair price has helped rebuild trust and improve the lives of the Mousso Faso women, says Ms Marquez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBuilding these stable trade relations helps them to grant their children the opportunity to go to school and to improve infrastructures and their daily lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut secure income is not the only concern for these women.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurkina Faso has become a terror hotspot.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, it topped the Institute for Economics and Peace Global Terrorism Index.\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder and Executive Chairman Steve Killelea explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2024, there was 1,532 deaths. That's about 25 per cent of all deaths globally. Successive weak governments through Africa, combined with a whole lot of tension between different tribal groups and ethnic groups within the Sahel, and that's been compounded by international Jihadists moving into the area now and starting to become active.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Government organisations or NGOs try to help Burkina Faso villagers tackle poverty and rising terrorism.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Marquez volunteers with an NGO called CIM Burkina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is y\u2019know an increasing violence on the country with armed groups that are attacking and there are lots of civilians dying, that has been increasing. So, the situation on the country overall is very, very hard. And this project and this relationship with Madam Tiger has been helping them to have a fair income for, to improve their lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor her part, Melbourne-based entrepreneur Laura Hindson is incredibly proud to be building a small business that helps the women of Burkina Faso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey've done things like building shelters, sorting shelters so that they're not as exposed to the sun. They've built wells and better facilities for washing the tiger nuts. They've been able to build a warehouse and pipelines as well. So, it has made a really big impact on the women and the farmers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global milk alternatives market is expected to reach 150-billion dollars by 2035.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian market is already worth more than $600 million annually - and is growing quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs local demand increases, Madame Tiger needs ever more tiger nuts, as Ms Hindson explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe bought six tonnes of tiger nuts in 2020. In the next year we did seven tonnes, then 15 tonnes, then 30 tonnes, and then last year's harvest was 60 tonnes. So they're 10 times what the volume was in 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger nut milk may be on a roll, but growing this business hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hindson says the support of family and friends was vital.\n\n\n\n",

I often liken it to photography which wasn\u2019t recognised as a legitimate art form for quite some time until it started to enter into museums and then into auction houses et cetera. I think we can see a similar, somewhat sped up trajectory for AI as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sale, titled Augmented Intelligence amassed over 1.1 million dollars, despite six of the artworks not selling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also accumulated over 6,500 signatures by artists calling to cancel the auction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an open letter to the gallery, the letter said, \u201cif you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction. Yours sincerely, the undersigned artists.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Sue Beyer, the distinction isn\u2019t so clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a multi-disciplinary artist, she says developments in AI simultaneously fascinate and repel her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using a lot of different new media and also AI. The AI, I really enjoy using because it\u2019s not perfect and I like its weaknesses. I\u2019m sort of treating like an oracle or not God, but I give the AI an instruction, or prompt and it gives me information in return. It\u2019s like a collaborative process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Beyer is even using the technology to learn more about herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve been using it is not really offensive or scary. Nothing like Black Mirror [[dystopian television series]] or The Terminator [[sci-fi movie]] or anything like that. I\u2019m asking questions like \u2018Who am I?\u2019 and \u2018Who is Sue Beyer?\u2019. I\u2019m sort of using irony because I\u2019m looking at what it means to be human using something that obviously isn\u2019t human.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Brisbane Portrait Prize announced it was changing its entry guidelines stating, \u201cit is impractical to have a blanket ban on the use of AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, it allowed entrants to submit artworks completely generated using image creation platforms like Midjourney or DALL-E.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving criticism by parts of the artistic community, organisers reconsidered its entry requirements to only allow works partly generated using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Dennis McCart\u2019s self-portrait using reprocessed AI images took home $10,000 for the Digital Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirrunga Wiradyuri, a Wiradjuri man and Founder of Birrunga Gallery won the competition's Packer Prize in 2021 for his portrait titled Night Rainbow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis First Nations gallery boycotted the prize last year for its guidelines on AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he will not be entering the award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was really unfortunate, because I know there are some very reasonable people within that organisation. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019ve got a great deal of respect for the decisions made. It would have been very easy to go, \u2018Oh, ok. We hadn\u2019t considered that. It doesn\u2019t even have to be considered a real good point, just a reasonable point. Why don\u2019t time out on this?\u2019. Everyone would have gone \u2018Great decision, the Brisbane Portrait Prize listens to Blackfellas.\u2019 Instead, what we\u2019ve got is we\u2019re pressing on regardless because we\u2019ve got experts who say its harmless. I don\u2019t get it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri believes it\u2019s not the change he opposed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, he says he\u2019s in favour of controversy and challenging messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about censoring, I\u2019m not about that at all. I just feel as though at a minimum you should not do harm and at the moment, I can see this doing harm. So, there\u2019s this reckless notion that it\u2019s ok to harvest and reproduce First Nations artwork. The ramifications for that are next level cultural appropriation, cultural theft, it\u2019s colonisation, it\u2019s disenfranchisement, it\u2019s diminishing, it\u2019s diluting, it\u2019s invisible-ing us again, another level of invisible-ing us. I mean, that all adds up to false representation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says cultural appropriation and stereotypical perceptions of First Nations art is a reality he still confronts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his galleries Cultural Creative Development Program, he provides professional exposure for emerging Aboriginal and Torres Strait artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means creating artworks for businesses' Reconciliation Action Plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says he still gets asked for traditional dot painting art.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a style derived from the Central and Western Desert regions of Australia - but not Wiradjuri in New South Wales, where he is from.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Louise Buckingham is the CEO of Arts Law Centre Australia, which provides specialised legal support to First Nations creators through its Artists in the Black service.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says with the rise of AI, cultural flattening and fake Indigenous art is rife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of how important the Indigenous art market is and also how extensive the market for fake souvenirs and fake art has been alongside of that and the damage it does to our existing art market. You know, one set of stakeholders is benefiting to a greater extent than ever in the context and history of the technology boom and one group is losing out to a greater extent than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Stock, a graphics software that provides royalty free photos and graphics, has faced scrutiny by the National Indigenous Times for its representations of First Nations art and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search of \u2018Indigenous Australian\u2019 brings up images of people with generic body markings or wearing Native American feather headdresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople wearing business suits on the platform are quote \u201crepresenting workplace diversity\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search for \u2018Indigenous Australian art\u2019 surfaces images of didgeridoos and boomerangs, AI rock and dot style paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extended licence for each of these AI images costs nearly 90 dollars on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Australia\u2019s current legislation, copyright for artistic works generally last the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says while this may seem like an extensive period, for First Nations communities whose art and culture moves across past, present and future, it can raise issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of AI-generated art, it gets more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, copyright law does not subsist or exist for artificial intelligence, as legally, there is considered to be no human authorship or originality to protect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also means that concerns over how AI models are being trained using artists' works are difficult to legislate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe responses to things like the Christie\u2019s auction which received a lot more in sales than people anticipated, but it also elicited a response from creators who were outraged that the notion of an auction for this kind of artwork. You know, there have been other responses from all around the world from creators of all descriptions and when we are talking about visual art, and we have class action complaints in the US that we will be watching very closely here in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA working group on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property was established in December last year, to protect First Nations knowledge amidst the rise of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says consultation from the working group has already been paused until after the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, The University of Chicago has developed tools like Nightshade or Glaze, which are being used by artists to fight back against AI data scraping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tools transform data from images into \u201cpoison\u201d, so that AI training on them without consent learn unpredictable behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this software, the university says a prompt that asks for an image of a cow flying in space might instead get an image of a handbag in space.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pfefferkorn from the Art, AI and Digital Ethics centre believes while AI is new, artists have been balancing the relationship between ethics, technology and science for centuries.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming jobs at a pace not seen since the rise of the internet, stirring anxiety across Australia's workforce about who will be replaced \u2014 and who might benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the past three decades, the internet has reshaped the way Australians work. Before that, offices transitioned from typewriters to computers, and earlier still came the transformative arrival of electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery technological leap brought unease, and the rapid rise of AI is now prompting a fresh wave of concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News spoke to cyber and workforce experts about why AI is generating so much caution \u2014 and what potential it could unlock for Australian workers.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence\n\nUntil a few years ago, AI was a concept that few people had extensive knowledge of beyond what the 1984 film Terminator had presented.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could AI in classrooms stop children falling behind at school?\n\nHowever, since the launch of ChatGPT (GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) in late 2022, AI has suddenly become a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nChatbots now appear routinely on websites, search engines are increasingly driven by AI, and tasks once completed manually are being automated.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than two years ago, the idea of an Australian company hiring an \"AI prompter\" seemed novel. Today, it is common.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Tuffley, a senior lecturer in applied ethics and cybersecurity at Griffith University, explained that when we talk about AI in the workforce, \"we are talking about large language models like ChatGPT\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a bunch of them, and they are basically really clever prediction engines, they just basically deduce what it is you want them or tell them to do,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence enables the automation of standard business processes that have previously been performed manually. Source: Getty / NurPhoto Tuffley said businesses had started automating standard operating processes that had previously been done manually, using agentic AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is using AI as an agent to do things, involves the cobbling together, a bit like Lego, of individual components of AI so that you get a workflow happening, and it's clever enough to make expert judgement depending on circumstances,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSo, which workers could be impacted by AI?\n\nExperts say the impact of AI on jobs is complex, with both potential disruptions and opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research from the Australian HR Institute (AHRI) paints a nuanced picture. According to the research, entry-level roles in the Australian workforce have increased in the short term due to AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nAHRI CEO Sarah McCann-Bartlett said the institute's latest Australian Work Outlook for the December 2025 quarter found four in 10 organisations (41 per cent) reported an increase in entry-level roles due to AI, compared with just 19 per cent reporting a decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said this trend aligns with Jobs and Skills Australia's recent Generative AI Capacity Study and a Technology Council of Australia report, both of which indicate AI is more likely to augment jobs than replace them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The survey data suggest that the future trajectory of the Australian jobs market is nuanced and uncertain,\" McCann-Bartlett said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Need a new job? These are the top 10 skills Australian employers are looking for\n\nProfessor Greg Bamber from Monash University's Business School and the Monash AI Institute shared a different view, stating \"clerical, entry-level, and administrative roles\" are among the jobs most exposed to AI and automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffley also noted that as more routine business processes are automated, he expects \"grassroots level employees, junior employees, will probably be made redundant\" as AI becomes more widespread.\n\n\n\n\n\nJanine Dixon, director of the Centre for Policy Studies at Victoria University, said Jobs and Skills Australia estimated 55 per cent of workplace tasks could be performed by people using AI, with another 15 per cent of tasks that could be entirely replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centre used these figures in modelling work to explore what the future Australian economy might look like.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe outlined two broad possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we can do a whole lot of things without using human input, that means we can have a whole lot more things; it means that we have economic growth and growth in incomes,\" Dixon told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The other thing is if there's a whole lot of things that can be done without humans, then there aren't jobs for humans in those areas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modelling suggests this could lead to a temporary rise in unemployment, although much depends on \"the speed of adoption of AI, which is quite unknown\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDixon also noted the modelling assumed the government would take a passive approach to how AI is adopted.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Kathryn lost her banking job to a chatbot. She just confronted her CBA bosses\n\nIdentifying job losses caused directly by AI is challenging, experts say. But one high-profile case emerged in July, when 45 Commonwealth Bank customer service employees were made redundant due to the impact of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat decision, however, was reversed after the Finance Sector Union took the matter to the Fair Work Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs and Skills Australia's report listed five occupation types most likely to experience job losses due to AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were general clerks, receptionists, accounting clerks and bookkeepers, sales, marketing and public relations professionals, as well as business and systems analysts, and programmers.\n\n\n\nJobs and Skills Australia's report listed five occupation types most likely to experience job losses due to AI. Source: SBS News In terms of industries that may lose the most jobs, the report highlighted retail trade, public administration and safety, financial and insurance services, professional, scientific and technical, and rental, hiring, and real estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Tuffley said the real risk may lie with workers who don't adapt to using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The kind of Luddites who just refuse to engage with the technology, they won't lose their jobs immediately, but over time they'll become less and less useful employees,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTurning AI into opportunity\n\nDixon said potential job losses could open doors in industries desperate for workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The release of those humans from those jobs that underpins a whole lot of income growth in the sense of having more people available to do other things, you get this sort of redistribution of jobs away from the jobs where there's a lot of automation potential for AI and into jobs where there isn't,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the modelling suggested \"potential expansions in areas such as a lot of the trades, a lot of the caring occupations, those hands-on and face-to-face occupations\".\n\n\n\nThe Jobs and Skills Australia report forecast employment growth in the construction industry, as well as accommodation and food services, manufacturing, education and training, and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Source: SBS News The Jobs and Skills Australia report forecast employment growth in the construction industry, as well as accommodation and food services, manufacturing, education and training, and agriculture, forestry and fishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles such as cleaners and laundry workers, midwives and nurses, business administration managers, construction and mining labourers, and hospitality workers were listed as those that would \"gain the most employment\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffley said workers who would adopt AI tools and utilise them to enhance their productivity would become more valuable to employers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It basically leverages their output sometimes, by, you know, 10 times,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To put it bluntly, it is going to make people redundant, but it is going to make existing businesses more efficient and therefore more profitable.\"\n\n\n\nTuffley said the \"hype around agentic AI exceeds the ability of most organisations to take full advantage of it\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They know it exists, and they'd like to be using it to good effect, but they're not quite sure how to do it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jobs and Skills Australia report urged the government to take the lead in steering the transition to a Gen AI-enabled labour market and to enhance AI capability across the entire population.\n\n\n\nUnions warn AI could threaten workers\n\nAs AI threatens to replace jobs across industries, the federal government has released its long-awaited National AI Plan, describing it as \"a whole-of-government framework that ensures technology works for people, not the other way around\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan aims to create an inclusive AI economy that protects workers, fills service gaps, and supports local AI development.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a significant shift, it confirms Australia will not introduce mandatory guardrails for high-risk AI, instead relying on existing laws and minor adjustments where needed, supported by a new $30 million AI Safety Institute within the Department of Industry.\n\n\n\nThe Jobs and Skills Australia report urged the federal government to take the lead in steering the transition to a Gen AI-enabled labour market. Source: NurPhoto / NurPhoto via Getty Images Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Joseph Mitchell welcomed parts of the plan but warned workers remain wary of AI's impact on jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Workers aren't afraid of AI but are rightly sceptical about letting it go unchecked, especially when the technology has already been used by big business to undermine wages, conditions, and to wipe out jobs,\" he said in a media release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Workers are tired of being told by large tech companies that AI will bring improvements in the far distant future, when our rights and our jobs are under threat right now,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\n\nThe AI era: Jobs we can't yet imagine\n\nBamber said the rapid pace of AI development means roles that feel secure today could face new pressures in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tasks previously considered impossible for AI might become possible as hardware, sensors, robotics, etc are improved,\" Bamber said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffley said predicting the impact of AI on workplaces is tricky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't know exactly what these new industries are going to look like, but what we do know is that in the history of technology, every new step forward like this, like the industrial revolution, which created a lot of new jobs that only 10 years earlier, no-one could have predicted what they would be,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"AI is a lot like electricity was 100 or so years ago. Electricity made possible all sorts of things. It was an enabling technology,\" Tuffley said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People realised that you could create an electric refrigerator or an electric water pump, or an electric whatever, and it created a whole new set of industries creating electrical appliances, devices driven by electricity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said change had created a lot of wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what I am sure will see is, in the coming decade or more, we'll see AI being used to create whole new categories of products that don't exist yet and I can't really say what they'll be, because that'll be the brainchild of some clever entrepreneur,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat workers can do to prepare\n\nKai Riemer, a professor of information technology and organisation at the University of Sydney, suggested workers learn and experiment with AI to get the most out of it.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Government announces long-awaited national plan for artificial intelligence\n\n\"Upskill yourself with free videos online or a microcredential, and experiment with different AI tools,\" Riemer told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nRiemer said some people made the mistake of using AI chatbots as if they were Google.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't use AI chatbots like a search engine, they're not. Instead, try reversing roles, have the AI ask you questions, give you feedback on your work,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said people could get the most out of AI by using it to \"build your skills, ask for explanations, not answers, and make sure you don't outsource your thinking\".\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A new report reveals the countries that Australian luxury travellers are eyeing for their 2026 getaways.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even among the world's top luxury hotspots, the cost of a holiday can differ sharply. So what can value-conscious travellers expect to spend if one of these destinations is on their bucket list?\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan, Italy, Greece, Croatia and Fiji topped the list from the 2026 Virtuoso Luxe Report, which surveyed 300 of the Virtuoso luxury travel network's advisers in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've really got two clear types of travellers in the Australian market at the moment \u2014 high-end luxury, and then those people that are seeking value,\" Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) CEO Dean Long told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the broader travelling population, Indonesia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States and Thailand were the top outbound destinations this year, according to the ATIA's latest trends report.\n\n\n\nJapan, Italy, Greece, Croatia and Fiji topped the list from the 2026 Virtuoso Luxe Report, which surveyed 300 of the Virtuoso luxury travel network's advisers in Australia and New Zealand. But not all destinations attracting luxury travellers are necessarily the most expensive. Got your sights set on one of them? Here's a snapshot of some of the costs you can expect.\n\n\n\nJapan\n\nJapan, which has surged in popularity across the travel market in recent years, will remain a hotspot for Australians in 2026, Long said, in part because of favourable exchange rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can really make the Aussie dollar go very far,\" he said. \"People are taking these opportunities now to really make the most of their time to get to Japan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan topped Virtuoso's list for the first time this year, according to Greg Treasure, general manager of the luxury travel network for Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\nJapan has become one of the hottest destinations for Australian travellers in recent years. Popular year-round, it draws tourists for ski season, Tokyo's city scene, Kyoto's stunning cherry blossom season, and many other attractions. Source: Getty / Francesco Riccardo Iacomino \"Italy, I think it's been our number one destination for quite some time,\" Treasure told SBS News. \"Japan has been extraordinarily popular, not only in the luxury space, but in the general travel space.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAirfares : Return airfares from Sydney to Tokyo start at around $700 if you're willing to make a stopover en route, or $1,100 for a direct journey, according to live Google Flights fares for next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan is popular year-round, but in the popular cherry blossom season in March and April, many direct flights cost upwards of $1,500 return.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Revealed: The travel hotspots Australians are heading to this summer\n\nAccommodation: For a 3-star room in Tokyo, expect to spend at least $85 per night for a couple in April, during Japan's peak spring season. Prices on Booking.com start from around $60 in January, which is winter time in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: A meal at an inexpensive restaurant in Tokyo can range from about $7.80 to $14.60, according to the Numbeo global cost of living database. On average, a coffee will set you back around $4.90 and a beer around $5.80, the crowdsourced database suggests.\n\n\n\nItaly\n\nWhile Italy will always be popular, Treasure said, price pressures, overtourism and crowding have put many travellers off European destinations in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe Colosseum is one of Rome's biggest drawcards, along with its food, history, culture and iconic landmarks. Source: Getty / Dave G Kelly Airfare: Return airfares from Sydney to Rome in February, the off-season, can range from around $1,175 for journeys with two or more stops to $1,375 for those with only one layover. In the peak summer season, many flights cost at least $2,000 return, though some cheaper deals do exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation: For a 3-star hotel in Rome in February, prices start from around $80 a night. In July, during the European summer, rooms in this bracket start from about $120.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: A meal at an inexpensive restaurant can range from about $21 to $44, according to the Numbeo cost of living database. A cappuccino might range between $2.10 and $4.40, while a beer might set you back around $8.80 on average.\n\n\n\nGreece\n\nThere's long been a high level of interest for Australian travellers to Italy and Greece, Long said, and he doesn't expect that to change \u2014 but \"we aren't expecting to see any significant growth\" to those destinations this year across the broader Australian market.\n\n\n\nAthens, with the world-famous Acropolis perched on a hilltop, also serves as a gateway to Greece's iconic islands, including Santorini. Source: Getty / nantonov Airfare: Return airfares from Sydney to Athens start from around $1,130 in the European winter and shoulder seasons next year. In the European summer months, flights generally start at around $1,550.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation: The cheapest rooms in the winter months start from around $40 a night for 3-star hotels and apartments on Booking.com. Prices start from about $60 a night in the summer peak season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: The average cost of a meal at a budget-friendly restaurant is $26.60, according to the Numbeo database. A beer typically costs $8.80 on average, while a cappuccino goes for around $6.50.\n\n\n\nCroatia\n\nTravel to Croatia has become more expensive, Treasure explained, amid soaring popularity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing that there is a little bit of price pressure coming on Croatia now,\" he told SBS News. \"Everyone hears about it, [it] becomes the next trend, and it gets really busy really quickly.\"\n\n\n\nDubrovnik in Croatia exploded in popularity after it was used as a filming location for the hit Game of Thrones TV show. Source: Getty / Nico De Pasquale Photography Airfares: Flights from Sydney to Dubrovnik, one of Croatia's most popular tourist hubs, typically include two or more stopovers, which can make fares a bit pricier than those to some other European destinations. In February, the off-season, return flights start from around $1,840. That starting price goes up to roughly $1,940 in July, a peak travel month.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation: The cheapest 3-star rooms on Booking.com for Dubrovnik in July start at about $140 a night. In February, that drops to about $75 a night.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: Expect to pay $26.60 on average for a meal at a reasonably-priced restaurant in Dubrovnik, according to Numbeo. A beer is estimated to cost around $12.40, while a cappuccino is around $6.35.\n\n\n\nFiji\n\nFiji is geographically the closest of the five destinations to Australia, making it the cheapest to fly to.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was among the first international destinations to reopen for Australian travellers after the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought \"exponential growth\" in its popularity, Long explained.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's brought with it a \"very high price point\" for accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we're comparing similar resort experiences to other destinations, it's really become far more challenging for Fiji to compete,\" Long said.\n\n\n\nFiji's Denarau Island, located around a 20-minute drive from Nadi International Airport, is home to a variety of major resorts. Source: Getty / Westend61 Airfares: Flights to Nadi International Airport in June, during the popular dry season, start from about $560 for a round trip. Prices are fairly consistent throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation: On Denarau Island, the resort destination closest to Nadi, 3-star accommodation starts at about $200 a night. For resort accommodation, prices start from around $400 in June and $250 in February, during the wet season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: A meal at an inexpensive restaurant costs around $6.60 on average, according to Numbeo data. A beer will set you back $3.80, while a cappuccino is on average $5.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Airfares were sourced via Google Flights live fares for 2026.

    "text": "We know Rilke primarily from the spacious majesty of the Duino Elegies and the personal mysticism of the Sonnets to Orpheus , sequences of poems written in highly charged free verse which are easily assimilated into English with adjustments according to taste in phrasing. What we tend not to know \u2013 or which we wrongly assimilate to free verse, distortedly \u2013 are Rilke\u2019s \u201cthing poems\u201d, his Dinggedichte , composed early in the 20th century. Now, Geoffrey Lehmann has translated them using a strict form which replicates Rilke\u2019s nine-syllable line. The upshot is miraculous. We feel we are reading a great poet without any diminution in formal power.\n\nThis book is a masterpiece, and it is made out of someone else\u2019s set of masterpieces. It is the translation by the octogenarian Australian poet Geoffrey Lehmann of a group of poems by Rilke, by common consent one of the very greatest poets of the high modern period, the figure in German poetry we might put alongside Yeats for grandeur and formal intensity and range.\n\nIf you are homeless, you will find no home.\n\nSolitary, you will remain alone,\n\nand wake and read and write long letters,\n\nand along empty avenues will roam,\n\nrestlessly here and there, as leaves are blown.\n\nThe formal brilliance of this is remarkable. We feel as if we\u2019re in an enchanted world where an early 20th-century poem has come into being through nothing but technical wizardry in service to a belief on Lehmann\u2019s part that the verse form will affect this extraordinary transubstantiation. No one would believe in the undertaking Lehmann has committed himself to, but it works. We believe this is Rilke, and it really is a matter of by their fruits shall ye know them.\n\nThe preoccupations of the poems can have their own paraphrasable interest \u2013 as in the version of one by Seamus Heaney \u2013 and, yes, in this form (which is a neglect of form) there will be the intrinsic interest of a great writer displaying his themes but not with this breathtaking inhabitation of the spirit that comes with the rhythm and the rhyme.\n\nRainer Maria Rilke\u2019s Elegies were described as \u201cthe greatest poem of the 20th century\u201d. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWe get biblical motifs, a young man looking at his face, its regularity and its ability to weather pain. There\u2019s the incomprehension in a crucifixion poem of the \u201cEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani\u201d cry of forsaking and the butcher boy, soldiers hoping for a show. There are various poems that make the Pieta primarily a landscape for Mary Magdalene. There\u2019s the poet\u2019s feeling for the sensuous figure of Christ.",

Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts, a comedy writer was busy securing the most intuitive web address for its new name, TrumpKennedyCenter.org, and turning it into a parody of the institution.\n\nNow, the website is drawing attention as a backlash grows over the rebranding of the centre to include Trump\u2019s name. High-profile artists have cancelled performances, and a federal lawsuit has challenged the renaming, saying that it requires an act of Congress.\n\nNew signage, The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Centre For The Performing Arts, on the Kennedy Centre.
