    "text": "Opinion: I keep seeing people acting shocked that social media is out of control, and yet the ban feels like the government has finally noticed a problem we've been living with for years and picked the laziest fix.\n\nBeing 15 and online isn't easy. I think anyone could tell you that. You're constantly faced with pressure to keep up with trends, look or act a certain way, and stay plugged in. Always.\n\nIt's chaotic, exhausting, and most people I know will admit that they're probably better off without it.\n\nFifteen-year-old Grace Anderson says the Australian government is taking the easy option with the implementation of the social media ban. (Supplied)\n\nSocial media hasn't just crept into the modern teenager's lives, it's steamrolled straight through.\n\nBut this doesn't mean the blanket ban is the hero solution it's been sold as.\n\nIn my opinion, banning social media is punishing the people. The people aren't the problem. The apps are.\n\n'What Australia needs is an overhaul, a genuine effort to collaborate with social media companies on making them a safer and useful place for everyone'\n\nBanning every under 16 doesn't fix the parts of social media that are actually broken. It doesn't change the algorithms that shove extreme content in your face. It doesn't make platforms take responsibility for the way they design apps to keep us addicted.\n\nWhen someone finds a way around the ban - because trust me, they will - the cycle just repeats.\n\nNothing improves. The problem doesn't disappear, it just goes into hiding.\n\nCutting teenagers off such a big part of society for the first 16 years of life doesn't \"fix\" social media. It just means that when we do turn 16, the shift is an unnecessary confrontation with reality that could so easily be softened.\n\nPolicies like these act as if every teenager is the same. That's not true - as if a 12-year-old on TikTok at 2am is identical to a 15-year-old using Instagram to keep up with school, friends, and sport. A harsh rule doesn't recognise differences.\n\nDifferences in people, in apps.\n\nI don't want to be treated like one big problem to be managed.\n\nIf governments actually wanted to help, they'd go after the companies. Force them to fix features that make social media so damaging - streaks, instant gratification, constant notifications. Instead we're stuck with a ban, which is the most basic solution to this complex problem.\n\nI could've thought of it.\n\nI'm not against it. Not fully. I can see where they were coming from. I see the addiction in society, I see it in myself.\n\nBut there were so many ways to help. To help kids see themselves in lights that aren't overshadowed by their phones. What Australia needed right now wasn't an age restriction, a blanket ban, a loss of trust with the government.\n\nWhat Australia needs is an overhaul, a genuine effort to collaborate with social media companies on making them a safer and useful place for everyone.\n\nThey took the easy option, and it will fail.\n\nDo you support banning under 16s from using social media? Yes 10410 No 3458",

(Getty)\n\nWhat are NDIS computer-generated plans?\n\nTalk of \"computer-generated NDIS plans\" refers to the new digital tool the NDIS will soon be implementing to help determine participant funding.\n\nIn October, the government announced changes to how budgets are determined for NDIS participants.\n\nUnder the new method, budgets will be decided based on a Support Needs Assessment.\n\nThe base of the assessment will be formed by the Instrument for the Classification and Assessment of Support Needs (I-CAN) tool.\n\nDeveloped by \ufeffthe University of Melbourne and the Centre for Disability Studies, the I-CAN tool has been used in the Australian disability sector for 20 years.\n\nThe I-CAN tool is a computer program, but it's not AI.\ufeff\n\n\"The Support Needs Assessment is not automated and does not use artificial intelligence,\" a National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) spokesperson told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"Decisions about a participant's needs will be made by a real person.\n\n\"Assessments will be conducted by trained assessors and plans will always be approved by real people who are trained NDIA staff.\" \ufeff\n\nWhen will the new NDIS computer-generated plans start?\n\n\"From mid-2026, the NDIS planning process will begin changing to make it fairer, more consistent and easier for participants,\" an NDIA spokesperson said.\n\nThe I-CAN planning model will be rolled out in stages, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe NDIA is reportedly \ufeffconducting participant and staff information sessions now.\n\nHow does the I-CAN tool calculate my budget?\n\nThe I-CAN tool will be used in conjunction with \ufeffin-person assessments to produce a Support Needs Assessment and develop participant budgets.\n\nAn NDIS participant will first meet with a trained assessor who will work to understand their \ufefflife and disability support needs.\n\nThe participant can bring family, support people or carers to the meeting.\n\nA new personal and environmental circumstances questionnaire will also be used to collect additional information about the participant's support needs.\n\nIn some cases, \ufeffwhere the participant's needs are more complex, reports from their treating health professionals may also be submitted.\n\n\ufeffInformation gathered by the assessor will be checked with the participant and their carers and put into the I-CAN tool.\n\nIt will then cost the participant's support needs and provide a budget or funding package.\n\nAll budgets produced using the I-CAN\ufeff tool must be approved by an NDIS staff member.\n\nHowever, NDIS staff cannot make any changes to a budget generated by I-CAN, according to reports.\n\nStaff can only request a \ufeffnew assessment from the I-CAN tool using different inputs.\n\nA \ufeffspokesperson for the NDIA, which administers the NDIS, said the new method would ensure more consistent collection of information and inform fairer plan budgets.\n\n\"This planning process uses a person-based and strengths-based approach that will result in simpler plans with more flexibility,\" they said.\n\n\"It will also reduce the need for participants to collect and pay for expensive reports.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said NDIA staff will spend more time with participants under the new framework.\n\nUnder the new framework, NDIS staff won't be able to amend budgets produced by the I-CAN tool. (9News)\n\nWhat if I disagree with my NDIS computer-generated plan?\n\nParticipants still have the \ufeffright to request a review of their plan, either internally or through the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART).\n\nAn internal review may involve conducting another assessment using the I-CAN tool.\n\nIf a participant is still unsatisfied, they can request a review through the ART.\n\nHowever, tribunal members will reportedly no longer have the power to directly amend an NDIS participant's plan if they believe it's incorrect.\n\nMore than 7000 new cases of participants appealing NDIA decisions were brought before the ART in the 2024-25 financial year alone.\n\nThat figure represented a \ufeff76 per cent increase year on year.",

(ABC News: Johanna Marie)\n\nMrs Owen said they signed a six-month lease with the caravan park because it was \"safer\" than camping in public parks.\n\n\"We're paying $680 a fortnight to live here,\" she said.\n\n\" It's ridiculously expensive to live on a bit of dirt. \"\n\nThe family's weekly charge is comparable with the fees for non-permanent visitors at the park.\n\nMrs Owen said after signing the lease, community housing provider Regional Housing Limited explained that because the agreement was considered \"independent living\", the family did not qualify for crisis accommodation for people considered homeless.\n\nThe family will remain on the social housing register, which has an average wait time of two and a half years.\n\nMrs Owen said the situation had been particularly difficult on her children, aged 11 and 13.\n\n\"As a mum I feel bad for my kids that they're in this situation,\" she said.\n\n\"I just want a roof over my boys' heads \u2026 That's all I'm asking for, just tiny bit of help and compassion.\"\n\nThe couple is making the best of the situation for their children. (ABC News: Johanna Marie)\n\nShort-term and emergency housing\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Housing and Public Works declined to comment on the couple's case for privacy reasons.\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, the spokesperson said the department funded community housing providers, including Regional Housing Limited, to support people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n\nThey said the department had allocated more than $396 million to 91 organisations in the 2025-2026 financial year to provide specialist homelessness services across Queensland, including three in the Bundaberg area.\n\nQueensland's social housing register has reached a record high, with the latest data showing 54,922 people on the waitlist in October.\n\nThat figure has grown by about 1,000 since the end of August.\n\nFamilies make up a large portion of people on the social housing register, with 30,709 active households waiting for a home.\n\nTom Smith says more needs to be done to help people into homes. (ABC News: Johanna Marie)\n\nBundaberg has a rental vacancy rate of 1 per cent and according to the Residential Tenancy Authority, a median weekly rent of $560 for a three-bedroom house.\n\nThe Queensland Council of Social Services told the ABC in October that rent prices in the town had increased by almost 80 per cent in the past five years.\n\nMember for Bundaberg, Labor's Tom Smith, said the government's partnership with community housing providers was failing people in desperate need of homes.\n\n\"There is absolutely no doubt that there's been changes and that we're seeing more and more families, which means more and more children living in tents, living in cars, living in the backyard of a friend's place,\" he said.\n\n\"That's simply not good enough.\"\n\nStorm season in a tent\n\nOn the cusp of the school holidays, Mr and Mrs Owen \u2014 who are each on a disability support pension \u2014 are bracing for the summer in their polyester-walled makeshift home.\n\nThey have already replaced tents and other equipment that was damaged during storms in November.\n\n\"Whenever we get rain, we hear it,\" Mrs Owen said.\n\n\"Whenever the wind blows, the tent's moving and we have to constantly lower this [awning] so this doesn't get damaged.\"\n\nThe family expects summer weather to be a challenge. (ABC News: Johanna Marie)\n\nShe said they hoped to one day secure social housing but in the meantime would continue applying for private rentals despite feeling overlooked, \"discriminated and judged\" by real estate agents.\n\n\"They look at us and say, 'You're not going to be able to afford that',\" she said.\n\n\"They talk about the vulnerable Australians \u2014 well, that's us, that is my family.\"",

(ABC Midwest Wheatbelt: Jo Prendergast)\n\nFourth-generation beekeeper Kim Fewster said it was difficult to compete in supermarkets, and to hear some imported products were not pure honey, as labelled, was distressing.\n\n\"It's very upsetting because the consumer doesn't know that the honey is adulterated,\" he said.\n\n\" What I keep saying to everybody is that if you buy honey that is local, if you go and buy your honey from the beekeeper down the road, that is the best honey in the world because you know where it has come from. \"\n\nMr Fewster said consumer confidence in honey labelling was low and the industry was attempting to increase consumer awareness of the benefits of buying local.\n\n\"I keep saying to everybody, 'You can buy a good kilo of beautiful West Australian honey for less than a Big Mac meal,'\" Mr Fewster said.\n\nAustralian honey producers say Australia's honey is some of the best in the world. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Jo Prendergast)\n\nThe Australian beekeeping industry has endured some of its most challenging times recently with millions of bees lost to varroa mite and drought reducing honey production in some regions.\n\nMr Lockwood said the best way for consumers to support the industry was to read a product label.\n\n\"The biggest thing they can do for the Australian industry, and ensure their honey is pure and clean, is to ensure it's 100 per cent Australian honey,\" he said.\n\n\"One out of every three mouthfuls of food we consume is directly impacted by honey bees pollinating that crop.\n\n\"So by buying Australian honey, we're supporting the beekeeper and therefore food security.\"\n\nMuch of Australia's food production depends on bee pollination. (Supplied: Jeremy Jones)\n\nTesting protocols under review\n\nA DAFF spokesperson said testing was being conducted to compare current assessment protocols.\n\n\"Imported honey samples are analysed using internationally accepted standard methods for detecting adulterated honey,\" they said.\n\n\"The department is conducting a pilot survey to assess the authenticity of imported honey samples and compare the department's current border tests with the performance of commercially available analytical tests.\n\n\"The results of this survey will inform if further work is required to update our testing capability at the border.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said 5 per cent of consignments were randomly referred for testing under the Imported Food Inspection Scheme.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024 honey products that were tested had an average compliance rate of 97 per cent.",

    "text": "Even from the penalty spot, Liverpool managed just fine without Mohamed Salah.\n\nAfter leaving the Egypt forward in England, Liverpool got a much-needed boost with a 1-0 win over Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday morning (AEDT). Barcelona and Bayern Munich also celebrated comeback wins and Chelsea lost.\n\nWith Liverpool's regular penalty taker Salah out of the squad following his public criticism of the club last week, Dominik Szoboszlai stepped up instead to score the 88th-minute penalty which earned a 1-0 win over one of the competition's best-performing teams.\n\nIt was all the more valuable coming after a run of one win in six games in all competitions for Arne Slot's under-pressure team, which moved up to eighth in the Champions League table and is now back in contention for a direct spot in the round of 16. Inter dropped to fifth.\n\nFollowing the win, the attention immediately turned back to Salah's apparent falling out with Slot and whether he would feature at the weekend against Brighton \u2014 Liverpool's last fixture before Salah departs to represent Egypt at the African Cup of Nations (AFCON).\n\n\"Well, you say everyone makes mistakes in life but the question is should the players also recognise that as well? And should the initiative come from the player or me,\" Slot said when asked post-match whether he'd like Salah back in his squad.\n\n\" There [were] a lot of things being said. That affects the players and the individual as well as he has been so, so influential. \"\n\nSalah's long-time teammate Andy Robertson called the club's current predicament \"a tough situation\".\n\n\"For me, he [Salah] is one of the greatest players to play for this club. He has been unbelievable for us. I signed the same window as him and we've been through so many highs and lows,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever happens, happens internally. We're all together in the changing room, and you could see that today.\n\n\"I love playing with Mo Salah and I hope to continue playing with him.\"\n\nSalah (left) created controversy at the weekend by saying his relationship with Slot (right) has completely broken down. (Getty Images: Molly Darlington)\n\nLiverpool's players thought they had taken the lead with Ibrahima Konate's header in the 31st minute. After a video review that lasted several minutes, it was ruled out for handball as Virgil van Dijk had earlier nodded the ball on to the arm of Hugo Ekitike.\n\nHaving taken away a goal from Liverpool, VAR came to the visitors' aid when it spotted that Alessandro Bastoni had tugged Florian Wirtz's shirt in the area, with the midfielder flailing to the ground. Szoboszlai converted the penalty.\n\nTeen sensation continues to star for Bayern\n\nBayern's 17-year-old midfielder Lennart Karl produced an audacious bit of skill to continue his high-scoring start to life in the Champions League in a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon which lifted Bayern to second behind Arsenal.\n\nKarl scored his third goal in four career Champions League games, controlling a pass from Konrad Laimer in mid-air before volleying a shot from a tight angle over two onrushing defenders and past the goalkeeper.\n\nIt was part of a 12-minute, three-goal turnaround for Bayern after Joshua Kimmich's own-goal handed Sporting the lead. Serge Gnabry levelled for Bayern when he was left unmarked at a corner in the 65th, before Karl scored Bayern's second in the 69th and defender Jonathan Tah made it 3-1 in the 77th.\n\nWidely viewed as German soccer's best young talent this season, Karl became Bayern's youngest-ever Champions League scorer in October on his first start in the competition.\n\nLate on, Canadian left back Alphonso Davies came off the bench for his first game since March after a serious knee injury.\n\nYamal sets Champions League record\n\nHeaders by Jules Kound\u00e9 three minutes apart gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory over Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nMarcus Rashford assisted in the first goal in the 50th and Lamine Yamal with a cross in the second in the 53rd.\n\nBarcelona's Lamine Yamal (left) continued the mesmerising start to his football career with another 'youngest ever' record. (Getty Images: David Ramirez)\n\nThe goal took Yamal to 14 career combined goals and assists in the Champions League, breaking a tie with Kylian Mbappe for the most by a player aged under 19, UEFA said.\n\nThe visitors had taken the lead with a goal by Ansgar Knauff in a 21st-minute breakaway at the renovated but only partially open Camp Nou stadium.\n\nSon says goodbye to Spurs\n\nSon Heung-min said a belated goodbye to Tottenham as his former club moved up to ninth after beating Slavia Prague 3-0 via an own-goal and two penalties in a game overshadowed by a dispute over moving a rainbow flag showing support for the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Alvarez scored for the ninth time in his last nine league-phase appearances to lead Atletico Madrid to a 3-2 come-from-behind win at PSV Eindhoven.\n\nMarseille held on for a 3-2 win over Union Saint-Gilloise, which had two potential equalisers ruled out for narrow offsides on video review.\n\nFolarin Balogun's close-range finish gave Monaco a 1-0 win over Galatasaray. Gelson Martins scored the only goal in Olympiakos' 1-0 win over Kairat Almaty in Kazakhstan.\n\nAP/ABC",

    "text": "Communications Minister Anika Wells has accepted her taxpayer-funded travel claims have prompted a \"gut reaction\" in people, after a week of scrutiny over her expenses drew attention away from the government's efforts to spruik its world-first social media ban.\n\nTaxpayer-funded flights for Ms Wells' husband to join her at Boxing Day cricket tests and AFL grand finals, bills to hold Comcars for several hours while she attended events, and a more than $100,000 trip to New York for a speech to world leaders on the government's social media ban, have drawn intense scrutiny.\n\nYesterday, Ms Wells referred her claims for audit by the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, but she has refused the Coalition's demand to step aside until that is resolved.\n\nMs Wells said she was trying to stay focused on her work.\n\n\"Absolutely not, I am the steward of a world-leading social media ban that has incredible cultural and generational change unfurling as of today,\" she said.\n\n\"I am also the communications minister who needs to make sure that taxpayers have confidence in the triple zero system, particularly over the summer.\"\n\nWells 'happy' for expense review, but dodges direct questioning\n\nIn a hastily arranged press conference outside Kirribilli House this morning to discuss the ban on children and teenagers under 16, the minister instead received a barrage of questions over the details of her travel claims.\n\nAlbanese tries to explain the inexplicable defending Wells's ski trip What was meant to be a Sunday interview bookending a remarkable political year became an exercise in explaining the inexplicable.\n\nAsked whether a taxpayer-funded trip where she attended a Labor fundraising event met requirements for travel claims to be for the dominant purpose of parliamentary business, Ms Wells responded that she had referred her travel claims.\n\n\"I have three different portfolios and have countless requests to be in different towns and cities to do all different things. I could probably live every day three times over and not get to all the requests,\" Ms Wells said.\n\n\" I always give really thoughtful care in the decisions I make in regard to my program ... I really do do my best. \"\n\nAsked whether it was appropriate for a Comcar to wait for eight hours while she attended an event, at a cost of more than $1,000, Ms Wells said she was \"happy\" for the independent authority to review that claim.\n\n\"We are looking at three and a half years of travel,\" Ms Wells said.\n\nMs Wells said she was confident she had upheld guidelines for charging taxpayers for travel, but that she was happy for that to be audited \"so there is no doubt\".\n\n\"I absolutely accept those figures prompt a gut reaction in people, I honestly accept that. I agree with everybody that parliamentarians' expenses should be scrutinised,\" Ms Wells said.\n\n\"I have been found to have followed the guidelines so far, but for the absolute avoidance of doubt I am happy for them to have another look.\"\n\nMs Wells said the rules were set \"at arm's length\" by the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority.\n\nPollies charge taxpayers $1.1m for family travel in 12 months Family reunion travel is under scrutiny as new analysis shows federal MPs and senators spent $1.1 million on flying and driving their loved ones to Canberra and around Australia in 12 months.\n\nBut the Coalition has said even if the minister has remained within technical guidelines, her travel claims have not met community expectations for how public money is used.\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, Shadow Finance Minister James Paterson said it was not enough for the expenses to be audited by the parliament's expense authority, saying the matter should also be referred to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to determine whether Ms Wells have breached ministerial standards.\n\n\"There is a real sense from this government that they had a big election win and can basically get away with anything,\" Senator Paterson said.\n\n\"Including spending $100,000 flying to New York city to speak for six-and-a-half minutes, including having a meal out in Paris at taxpayers' expense that cost $1,000 for food and $750 for alcohol, and including keeping Comcar drivers waiting up to ten hours while you're at a sporting event in a corporate box sipping free champagne.\n\n\"I don't think it's sufficient that it has been referred to [the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority] only for independent investigation, I think there is a chance the ministerial code of conduct has also been breached.\"\n\nAs scrutiny has spread to other ministers and MPs in other parties, some have also questioned whether the rules should be revisited.\n\nEarlier, while also attempting to market the government's social media ban, Mr Albanese evaded whether he believed the rules for MP expense claims should be tightened.\n\n\"I think it's really important that an independent authority be just that, that I don't pre-empt what the independent authority thinks,\" Mr Albanese said.",

(ABC Radio Brisbane: Kenji Sato)\n\nExploiting a legal loophole\n\nIt is illegal to advertise medicinal cannabis products in Australia, but University of Queensland biostatistician Carmen Lim says the practice is rife and growing rapidly.\n\nThe public health researcher said Australian clinics were using increasingly aggressive marketing tactics to target vulnerable young people like Ms Wilson.\n\nShe said this included using targeted social media ads, memes, Black Friday sales and online competitions and giveaways designed for young audiences.\n\nDr Lim said the companies used demographic data and third-party cookies to target their advertisements.\n\nDr Lim said the clinics used cryptic language and abstracted representations of cannabis leaves in an attempt to circumvent advertising laws.\n\nShe said these advertisements were becoming more brazen and more numerous, with Australia's regulators struggling to keep up.\n\nDr Lim said some advertisements skirted a legal grey area, while others were unambiguously illegal.\n\n\"The cannabis industry is super lucrative, so it doesn't make sense to fine them a few thousand dollars and let them get away with it,\" Dr Lim said.\n\n\" I think we should find a way to take them down, because more young people are being affected. \"\n\nDr Lim said medicinal cannabis was justified in some instances, but she was concerned prescriptions were largely being issued without a valid medical reason.\n\nShe said this was of particular concern when clinics advertised \"discrete\" and \"no awkward questions\" services.\n\nDr Lim said this could signal to customers that the clinic was willing to issue prescriptions with few questions asked, based on self-diagnosis of symptoms.\n\nA Therapeutic Goods Administration spokesperson said reports of unlawful advertising were subject to robust assessment and investigation.\n\n\"Advertisements for therapeutic goods must comply with the requirements in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Suspected breaches of advertising requirements can be reported via the TGA's online portal.\"",

It\u2019s a voice that\u2019s at turns full of yearning and subtly rendered emotion or dripping with swagger and sensuality. Perfume Genius (left) performs with Aldous Harding at the Forum Melbourne on December 4. Credit: Richard Clifford All this was on full display at the Forum, where Hadreas, who has forged a career making mesmerising, impressionistic music for the queer and queer-adjacent, arrives on stage like a postmodern Saint Sebastian, ready to martyr himself to art. The tour comes off the back of his recently released seventh studio album, Glory, a work that puts his soul-baring lyrics in dialogue with layers of richly textured, cinematic instrumentation. Glory was largely written during lockdown and is a product of the uncertainty of those times: its animating themes are grief, anxiety, isolation. Despite this, it is not a depressing record, but rather something transcendent.\n\nThe show puts Hadreas\u2019 range on display, as he moves effortlessly from the propulsive, emotionally charged suffering of In a Row to the plaintive and tender piano ballad Me & Angel. One of the most arresting moments arrives early when, in a world debut, Hadreas invites New Zealand\u2019s Aldous Harding on stage to perform No Front Teeth. Already an album stand-out, the duet takes on new emotional resonance in this live performance, as Harding\u2019s gossamer vocals soar to the Forum\u2019s highest reaches and the song builds to a flaring, guitar-heavy climax. It is a rare treat for the audience and something unlikely to be repeated any time soon. Perfume Genius is a bodily performer. Credit: Richard Clifford Elsewhere, Hadreas pulls crowd-pleasing hits from the Perfume Genius back catalogue, from the deliciously camp Slip Away to the eminently danceable On the Floor (its potential goes sadly unfulfilled as Melbourne audiences simply do not dance). Otherside delivers another show highlight, as Hadreas makes inventive use of silence and negative space before unleashing beautiful aural chaos. The encore comprises two covers \u2013 Big Star\u2019s Kangaroo and Mazzy Star\u2019s Fade into You \u2013 before the show closes with the exhilarating and defiant celebration of queer selfhood, Queen. Hadreas is a bodily performer, contorting his limbs and executing gravity-defying back bends as he sings, though these objectively quite taxing moves seem to come to him as easily as breathing. He has a dancer\u2019s grace and a showman\u2019s unerring self-confidence. Yet you get the sense that everything he does on stage is for himself first: the audience is merely there as witness.\n\nReviewed by Nadia Bailey\n\nMUSIC\n\nMelbourne Women\u2019s International Jazz Festival\n\nAshling O\u2019Farrell / Virago with Flora Carbo \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Jazzlab, December 7 Sonja Horbelt must be some kind of conjuror. The program for this year\u2019s Melbourne Women\u2019s International Jazz Festival \u2013 which Horbelt has directed for many years \u2013 is particularly impressive, with numerous acts from overseas and interstate, plus several premieres and special collaborations. Flora Carbo with Virago. Yet the budget for the 2025 festival is actually smaller than the (already slim) budget for last year\u2019s event. Somehow, Horbelt has juggled funding sources, artist schedules and well-timed visits by expat musicians to assemble a genuinely enticing line-up. Sunday\u2019s double bill began with an engaging set by 21-year-old trombonist and vocalist Ashling O\u2019Farrell, the VCA\u2019s \u201cNew Horizons\u201d artist for 2025. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s tone on both trombone and vocals was suffused with an appealing warmth, augmented by the sensitive accompaniment of her rhythm section.\n\nThen came the unveiling of a newly commissioned work that was years in the planning, but which came together in less than a fortnight. Local saxophonist and composer Flora Carbo met American percussionist Sofia Carbonara in 2019, and \u2013 after Carbonara moved to Melbourne \u2013 the pair began dreaming of a full-length collaboration. That dream came to fruition last month, when Carbonara\u2019s US-based Virago quartet flew to Australia to develop and rehearse a work written for them by Carbo, to be premiered at the festival. Loading Combining intricately notated parts with passages of free-form spontaneity, the as-yet-untitled piece made the most of the group\u2019s unusual instrumentation: two alto saxophones, violin, cello and vibraphone. The suite opened with quivering harmonics from Carbonara\u2019s vibraphone, beckoning the other instruments to join them and coalesce into a single, trembling note. Gradually the players began to diverge, creating a mournful dissonance as Magnolia Rohrer\u2019s violin and Wesley Hornpetrie\u2019s cello slid away from BethAnne Kunert\u2019s sax, and Carbo\u2019s mini drum machine added a subtle, syncopated heartbeat. In other sections, minimalist repetition created pulsating waves where saxes, strings and vibes moved in deft interlocking patterns, before dissolving in a swirl of improvised abstraction or settling into a glade of delicate, folk-like serenity. At times challenging, at times strikingly beautiful, this was the kind of ambitious and compelling work that festivals are made for.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas\n\nMUSIC\n\nNo\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAustralian Brandenburg Orchestra, Melbourne Recital Centre, December 6 Brimming with festive cheer, this year\u2019s edition of the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra\u2019s Christmas offering took on a Spanish flavour. This musical accent honoured Tommie Andersson, the orchestra\u2019s foundation theorbo and baroque guitar principal, who is making his final appearances with the ABO this tour after delighting audiences for nearly 40 years. This year\u2019s edition of the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra\u2019s Christmas offering took on a Spanish flavour. Credit: Laura Manariti Under the irrepressibly energetic direction of Paul Dyer, the orchestra and Brandenburg Choir were joined by guests Argentinian mezzo-soprano Maria Eugenia Nieva and Australian classical guitarist Andrew Blanch. Wearing a full-length bright red dress with a side slit, Nieva exuded plenty of Latin sensuality. Her strong, dark-chocolate mezzo voice animated a variety of numbers from the traditional carol Ri\u00fa Ri\u00fa Chi\u00fa, through Gioia & Amore by Spanish renaissance composer Soto de Langa and Nana from Six Popular Spanish Songs by Manuel de Falla to Santa la noche, an arrangement of Adolphe Adam\u2019s beloved classic O Holy Night.\n\nBlanch, who featured prominently in the program, was especially brilliant in Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Leyenda, arranged to showcase the simmering passion of the guitar\u2019s rapid-fire flamenco technique. Once again, the Brandenburg Choir brought sheer delight to the choral aspect of No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! with crisp ensemble work and crystalline diction. Between the customary bookends, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, and O Come, All ye Faithful, came some English schmaltz courtesy of John Rutter and Philip Stopford, as well as an intense account of the Kyrie from Palestrina\u2019s Missa Papae Marcelli. In chamber formation, the Brandenburgs themselves were in top form, bringing joyous dynamism to Monn\u2019s Sinfonia in G and whimsy to an arrangement of God Rest ye Merry, Gentlemen. Andersson\u2019s own solos and his poignant accompaniment of Stille Nacht (Silent Night) with its original Austrian lilt mirrored his quiet but impressive dedication. No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! continues to be a distinctive but deservedly popular Christmas tradition.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nParcels: LOVED Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSidney Myer Music Bowl, December 4 I dare you to stand still at a Parcels show. From the minute they hit the stage, the band\u2019s blend of electro-pop and disco-pop rhythms has the crowd possessed, grooving along to the psychedelic funky beat. The Australian five-piece indie band formed in Byron Bay in 2014, and made the spontaneous move to Berlin that year. They have played some high-profile gigs in 2025, including Coachella and Glastonbury. This weekend, their national tour concludes in Sydney with two gigs on the steps of the Opera House. It\u2019s hard to stand still at a Parcels show. Credit: Martin Philbey The band experiments with many different sounds across the set. Opening with Tobeloved, they show off their signature harmonies, reminiscent of The Beach Boys. It\u2019s clear how Berlin club culture has influenced their music when they perform Gamesofluck, the stage lit with an electric blue as the keys and guitar pulse. They performed Overnight, a single co-produced and co-written with Daft Punk after they attended Parcels\u2019 first-ever show in Paris in 2016; the duo\u2019s electronic influence is evident in the live sound.\n\nFinallyover, their final song, has a much more mellow, retro rock feel like The Beatles. They perform a lengthy instrumental track which feels improvised, exerting riffs that resemble the disco energy of Boney M and AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck. Parcels in full flight. Credit: Martin Philbey \u201cI know we are a lot of people, but we move as one tonight,\u201d says one of the band, indistinguishable in the moody lighting, and that collective feeling carries through, maintaining a chill vibe across the entire set. During Summerinlove, the crowd leans into the sexiness, with footage of couples kissing in the front row projected onto a heart-shaped kiss cam on the screen above. It\u2019s clear the band are having just as much fun as the crowd. Patrick Hetherington\u2019s foot pounds the stage as Jules Crommelin\u2019s hips thrust against his guitar and Noah Hill\u2019s neck jerks back and forth like a chicken. The band seemed to have as much fun as their energetic audience. Credit: Martin Philbey\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of euphoria that fills the atmosphere at the all-ages concert. Like a rave, the infectious beats travel through your ears and all the way to your feet. The band asks tech staff to light up the crowd, as they peer into the masses extending up the theatre and across the green of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. As Crommelin perches at the end of the stage, he says: \u201cJust going to take a second to take this all in.\u201d What a start to the summer.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar THEATRE\n\nSoul of Possum \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until December 13 A few months ago, after nearly 10 years of consultation, parliament passed Treaty legislation for Aboriginal Victorians. It\u2019s the first treaty of its kind in Australia and one that not only acknowledges past injustices but also commits to returning decision-making powers to Aboriginal communities. Presented within this context, this latest staging of Soul of Possum serves as a potent and topical reminder of the past that still needs present-day reckoning. Soul of Possum is based on the experiences of the playwright\u2019s ancestors. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nBased on the personal histories of playwright Brodie Murray\u2019s ancestors (in particular his father and grandfather), the play is a taut reenactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and members of an Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. With a few cast changes, Soul of Possum\u2019s latest iteration follows a successful season at Castlemaine State Festival and Yirramboi Festival in 2021. It\u2019s 1853 in Wamba Wamba Country and Marnuu (Balla Neba) is troubled by his dreams; the voice of Possum predicts wide-scale destruction by a hostile force, a devastation of both people and wildlife. But his fellow warriors Gundi (Wimiya Woodley) and Barru (Murray) are sceptical and mock his warnings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a steamboat moored at the river, with a military expedition about to disembark to open up the country for \u201cglorious empire\u201d. It\u2019s a story most of us should know; this first-contact skirmish between two parties who are completely alien to the other\u2019s customs and cultures, and the resulting and continuing legacy of settler occupation. The play asks us to imagine what it was actually like in the initial round of invasion and resistance, a pattern that would repeat itself across the land. The play is a taut reenactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and the Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nThe stage is sparse except for a large projection of the riverbank at the back, two platforms on the left that serve as the steamboat and a clump of river reeds, a tree and a campfire to the right. Loading Preview night brought some rushed dialogue from the trio of warriors that should hopefully settle for the rest of the season. Maybe they feel there\u2019s no time to waste: under Beng Oh\u2019s direction, the 70-minute narrative moves fast, with the plight of both sets of white and blackfellas played out in alternate scenes before they finally meet. What makes Soul of Possum interesting is that it dramatises the in-fighting among each group. The First Nations Australians lose valuable time arguing about what to do with the threat of territorial trespass while the English marauders \u2013 Captain Gibbons (Leigh Scully), Lieutenant Bankes (Gabriel Partington), Dr Wilkins (Kevin Dee) and Irish convict Yates (Luke Mason) \u2013 have their own on-board power conflicts to contend with. All four characters are performed with ease and conviction. There\u2019s an earnestness about this play and some unnecessary repetition in the script. The ending that brings us back to the present day also seems a bit too expository after everything we\u2019ve witnessed. Nonetheless, Soul of Possum does manage to take us into the crossfire of colonial violence in its short, sharp stage time.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nSoul of Possum was reviewed from a preview performance.",

    "text": "This is not the first time Trump has had to pay farmers compensation for his tariff. During the trade war in his first term, he handed out $US23 billion of aid. The farmers would, you\u2019d assume, prefer to be able to trade freely rather than rely on government charity. Loading Trump and his officials have described the payments as a \u201cbridge\u201d to tide the farmers over until China delivers on its promises, even though the experience of the 2020 \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, in which China made similar promises that it didn\u2019t meet, suggests there\u2019s a possibility that it will be a bridge to nowhere. It\u2019s consistent, however, with the administration\u2019s broader assertions that Americans only have to wait \u2013 initially it was supposed to be this year, now it\u2019s next year and beyond \u2013 for the benefits of the tariffs to flow. The administration has previously rolled back tariffs on coffee, bananas, tomatoes and other foods that the US doesn\u2019t produce in significant quantities in an attempt to blunt the impact of tariffs-induced spikes in prices and the cost of living for US households\n\nNow it is subsidising its own agricultural production, while blaming the Biden administration and other countries for the losses of markets and the affordability crisis for middle and lower income household in the US that its own policies have created. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be able to connect the dots between the cause and the effect. The hardship being experienced by US farmers isn\u2019t only due to the closure of the Chinese market to their products after the April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. It\u2019s not just a revenue problem. Their input costs have risen sharply because fertiliser prices and farm machinery prices, among other items, have also jumped because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The administration lowered the tariffs on some fertilisers last month in an implicit recognition of their impact, although Trump this week threatened \u201cvery severe\u201d tariffs on Canadian potash in order to boost domestic production of fertilisers. About 95 per cent of Canada\u2019s potash is exported, with about 50 per cent of those export volumes directed to the US. A tariff on potash would flow through to another hike in farm costs. Farm machinery prices have risen because Trump slapped 50 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium and tariffs on other imported items used in their manufacture. About a quarter of the components in a John Deere tractor are imported.\n\nTrump, predictably, blames Joe Biden\u2019s environmental rules for the rising cost of farm machinery and has said he will wind them back. \u201cYou buy it, it\u2019s got so much equipment on it for the environmental, it doesn\u2019t do anything except it makes the equipment much more expensive and much more complicated to work,\u201d he said on Tuesday. John Deere has said that Trump\u2019s tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminium, will cost it $US600 million this year. It has laid off about 240 workers this year in response. The other challenge for US farmers is labour. Trump\u2019s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants has produced a shortage of labour and forced up labour costs. More than 40 per cent of US crop workers lack legal status. So, the tariffs have closed markets and reduced farm income while the tariffs and immigration policies have driven up costs. The bailout might help some farmers limp on into next year, but they aren\u2019t a long-term response to the bind the farmers find themselves in.\n\nThe lost markets, higher fertiliser and machinery costs and shrunken pool of labour are structural changes to the economics of American farms that can\u2019t easily, or readily, be unwound. Loading Even if China does buy more soybeans and other agricultural commodities, it will buy much less than it did before Trump decided tariffs had magical qualities, able to fix the US trade deficit, rebuild the US manufacturing base, reduce US deficits and debt, fund $2000 \u201cdividends\u201d to households and even enable the abolishment of US income taxes. Oh, and bail out farmers. China helped build the infrastructure in Brazil than has enabled it to displace the US as its major supplier of soybeans. It has also begun buying the beans from Argentina, much to the chagrin of the US farmers, who saw their administration give that country a $US20 billion bailout package that helped it sell up to $US7 billion of soybeans to China. Having been burned twice by Trump\u2019s tariffs, China will maintain the diversity of supply it has helped create. Its market, and those of other countries hit by the tariffs, will never be as open to US producers as they once were.",

The coverage has turned more critical in the days since, however. On Background tried to speak to Carroll and Pilling directly about why such an important exclusive was pulled. The comment we got came from a corporate spin doctor. A News Corp spokesperson confirmed the story was removed, but said all the company\u2019s publications have been covering the debate about Wells\u2019 travel expenses closely and prominently on their print front pages and digital home pages. They also rejected any suggestion of government interference or executive influence.\n\n\u201cWith one particular story, there was an editorial decision to review its publication. All decisions on editorial coverage have been made by editorial independent of government interference or executive directive,\u201d the spokesperson said. The world-first social media ban came into effect on Wednesday, and has been described as a legacy-shaping policy for the Labor Party and for Wells. It was prompted and has been championed by the News Corp campaign, alongside a campaign \u201c36 Months\u201d led by Nova presenter Michael \u201cWippa\u201d Wipfli, arguing for the minimum age for social media usage be raised from 13 to 16. Nova is also owned privately by News Corp chair Lachlan Murdoch. \u201cLet Them Be Kids\u201d and \u201c36 Months\u201d were both launched in May 2024, the former splashed across the front pages of the company\u2019s metro tabloid newspapers at the time and in the lead-up to the ban going live this week. Both launched petitions urging the government to impose a minimum age to access social media. The tabloids\u2019 homepages also featured countdowns to the ban going live this week.\n\nOn Sunday, The Daily Telegraph detailed the inception of policy itself and how it successfully lobbied this government. It started with an \u201cintimate dinner at the Lodge\u201d in September 2024 between Emma Mason, the mother of Matilda Rosewarne who took her own life as a 15-year-old after sustained online bullying; Pilling; Courier Mail editor Chris Jones; Albanese and his partner, Jodie Haydon; and Albanese\u2019s press secretary, Fiona Sugden. \u201cPilling found herself arguing for a social media ban up to the age of 16, rather than 14 or 15. At some point, it occurred to her that she and Albanese were not talking about the question of a ban. They were talking about the details of a ban,\u201d the story on Sunday read. \u201cI knew then that this was probably going to happen,\u201d Pilling told The Daily Telegraph. \u201cThat was a pretty pivotal moment in the process.\u201d Pilling then went on to front and lead the campaign, which ultimately resulted in the bill that comes into effect on Wednesday.

A month before the ban took effect, social media platform Reddit and streaming site Kick were included.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle-known apps Lemon8 and Yope have also been warned they may be added in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Europe, governments and institutions are tightening restrictions on children's social media use, with Australia's laws increasingly viewed as a reference point .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Smuggling balloons drifting over the Belarusian border have forced repeated shutdowns at the airport in Lithuania's capital Vilnius, in what authorities call a \"hybrid attack\" by Belarus, a Russian ally.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince October, the airport just 30km from Belarus has closed more than a dozen times, disrupting hundreds of flights and affecting thousands of passengers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Lithuania declared an \"emergency situation\" over the influx of balloons, describing it as a \"hybrid attack\" orchestrated by the Belarusian government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure is one step below a \"state of emergency\", which can only be declared by parliament when the country's \"constitutional order\" is in danger.\n\n\n\nWhat are these balloons?\n\nThe high-altitude balloons, filled with helium or hydrogen, fly where the wind takes them but their altitude can be controlled remotely from the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically used by meteorologists to probe stratospheric conditions starting 15km above ground, they have been repurposed to smuggle cheap Belarusian cigarettes into Lithuania. The practice surged after tighter border controls were imposed during a 2021 migrant crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst spotted in 2023, the balloons became widespread in 2024, with several hundred recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey pass over the border at an altitude of about 3 to 4km. The smugglers in Lithuania can then communicate with the balloon to track its location, and direct it to land.\n\n\n\n\n\nA balloon typically carries 500 to 1,500 packs of cigarettes, with a pack costing less than a euro, versus 4.5 euros per similar brand in Lithuania.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE 'Narco-subs': How thousands of tonnes of cocaine are being shifted across seas\n\nSo, what's the problem?\n\nAuthorities say the balloons fly at a similar height to aeroplanes approaching an airport, raising the risk of collisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal rules for what constitutes a mid-air risk have recently been upgraded, and the balloons now frequently qualify.\n\n\n\n\n\nLithuanian authorities have fine-tuned their detection systems and have been able to better identify whether the flight paths of any identified balloons pose a threat to civil aviation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince October, Vilnius Airport has been closed for more than 60 hours due to the threat posed by smuggling balloons, impacting more than 350 flights and approximately 51,000 passengers, according to the interior ministry.\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the cigarettes?\n\nLithuania says smuggled cigarettes are typically manufactured in Belarus and many are smoked in Lithuania.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lithuanian Border Guard confiscated 1.4 million packs of illicit cigarettes in 2024, of which 1.2 million packs were marked for sale in Belarus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lithuanian government initially said the balloons were not being shot down because of the danger to lives or property posed by their heavy payloads.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials have since authorised the use of \"kinetic measures\", but Lithuania's chief of defence said the army had not yet found cost-effective methods to identify and bring down balloons.\n\n\n\nHow has Belarus responded?\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko says Lithuania is exaggerating incidents with smuggler balloons but that Minsk does not want a war with its neighbours.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe called Lithuania's earlier closure of the border, which lasted several weeks, a \"crazy scam\" and, in turn, accused the West of waging a hybrid war against Belarus and Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelarus, which allowed its territory to be used for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has accused Lithuania of deploying a drone to spy on it and drop \"extremist material\". Vilnius has rejected this charge.\n\n\n\n",

What we're really doing is empowering parents to put in place a standard that's better for their mental health that everyone knows is the law and everyone can comply by. The resistance we're seeing from big tech is highly surprising. I mean this is a reform that started here in South Australia is now genuinely going global.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advent of the government's youth social media ban has been overshadowed by an expenses scandal plaguing Communications Minister Anika Wells.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister maintains it's all been within rules, but says she's self-referred herself to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority for an audit.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, it was revealed she'd spent more than $100,000 on flights for herself and three staffers to spruik the ban at the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther expenses that have raised eyebrows include car charges and airfares for her family to join her at sport events and at the snow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading overseas now and...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe renewed border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia continues to escalate, with both countries blaming each other for the collapse of a ceasefire agreed in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nCambodia says seven civilians have been killed and 20 injured, while Thailand reports one military casualty and 29 people injured during skirmishes in border regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs tens of thousands flee the expanding conflict zone, Cambodia's Senate President Hun Sen says his country is capable of a fierce fight against Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand has conducted a series of air strikes, and Defence Ministry Spokesperson Rear Admiral Surasat Kongsiri says military measures will continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThailand is determined to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity and therefore military measures must be taken as necessary to protect Thailand\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has described Europe as a \u201cdecaying\u201d group of nations led by \u201cweak\u201d people.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with the Politico website, he criticised them for failing to control migration and end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's his strongest criticism of European leaders yet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know them really well. Some are friends, some are ... ok. I know the good leaders, I know the bad leaders, I know the smart ones, I know the stupid ones,you got some real stupid ones too. They're not doing a good job in many ways, they're not doing a good job. They talk too much, they're not producing. We're talking about Ukraine - they talk, but they don't produce.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump also suggested Ukraine should give territory to Russia to achieve peace, as Russia's size and power makes it the likely victor in the conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nItalian firefighters have rescued 37 stranded goats from the snowy peak of Mount Cardinello on the border with Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goats had been missing for days after finding their way to an altitude of about 2,500 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the help of a helicopter, firefighters brought them back to their hut at 600 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goats are reported to be in good condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport now...\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer number one draft pick Kristie-Lee Weston-Turner and Brisbane star Taylor Smith are among the AFLW players whose bids to land a new club will come down to the final day.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlenty of big names, have already sealed their moves, but others may have to wait for the closing moments at Marvel Stadium on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a busy trade period, Weston-Turner wants to join back-to-back premiers North Melbourne after just eight games across two seasons at the Bulldogs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the two teams are at an impasse in regards to her value, which could force the youngster to try her luck in the draft.\n\n\n\n",

Just the very fact that I did go public that day probably did save my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSlater had premium private health insurance. If he had been admitted as a private patient, accessing the lifesaving technology used to treat him may not have been possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report by healthcare consulting firm HTAnalysts says that patients are waiting an average 4.7 years for clinically proven, lifesaving technologies to get approved in Australia.\n\n\n\nCardiothoracic surgeon Jayme Bennetts says the current approval process creates inequities in patient care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main issue is that there is a significant time component to getting new technologies,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said updates to existing technologies and approval of new technologies go through the same regulatory pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That regulatory pathway is taking on average just shy of five years to get new products approved, which means that patients are being unable to access what is potentially a better and an improved way of dealing with their problems, especially with heart pathologies,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And \u2026 those technologies are already readily available overseas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says that in order for Australia to catch up to global best practice in the US and Germany it must reform to streamline processes, promote alternate funding mechanisms and increase transparency.\n\n\n\nIan Burgess, the chief executive of the Medical Technology Association of Australia, said delays have costs for both individuals and the wider health system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Australia, there's funding and access gaps to new innovative medical technologies, and that directly impacts on patient access,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It means there's inequitable patient access and it slows down adoption of medical technologies, new innovation, and when that new innovation can drive enormous value in terms of to an individual patient, better outcomes, better quality of life, and drive efficiency in our health system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report calls on the Australian government to establish performance targets for reimbursement times.\n\n\n\nIt also calls for the development of a provisional funding mechanism for new and innovative technologies in the private sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nBennetts says disparities between the private and public sector mean greater inequity in treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The regulatory pathway really is more limiting in the private sector than the public. Often some of these new technologies are available earlier publicly because they don't need to have the same approval and funding regulatory pathways through to get them to be available in that system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile he says reform is needed to speed up these regulatory pathways, Bennetts says the regulations exist for good reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the pathways are designed to ensure that we have a system that can afford healthcare, but also that we are delivering devices and technologies to patients where there is a proven benefit that is actually one, safety and efficacy for the patient, but two is also cost-efficient for the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So those systems I think are very good and are designed with the right intent. We just need a more efficient pathway of new technologies and devices to be able to be approved quicker.\"\n\n\n\nFor people like Stuart, access to the right technology not only saved his life, but made it better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was the greatest day of the rest of my life,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Little did I know that day that I had a 10 to 15 per cent chance of living. Your odds aren't good and you need everything to go your way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But 20 years ago, if I had an aortic dissection, I wouldn't have lived. And that's just showing that what the medical technology has done since then. I've had two new grandkids, my kids have had kids, but I'm just enjoying life so much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm probably the person I always wanted to be now because I'm more relaxed with everything. People say it's a second chance of life, but it's not \u2014 it's just realising how lucky you were.\"\n\n\n\n",

The same can be said for social media,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior lecturer and researcher in communications at Edith Cowan University, Catherine Archer, said the Albanese government is likely celebrating the international recognition it has attracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As we all know, they went to the United Nations with this and made quite a strong stand on it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the populist move \u2014 the majority of adults agree with it.\"\n\n\n\nPolling indicates that most Australian adults support the ban. However, a Resolve Political Monitor survey for the Nine newspapers found that only about 35 per cent of respondents were confident social media companies could effectively block users under 16, and fewer than one in three believed the ban would be fully enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the shift has improved Australia's standing with liberal progressive audiences in parts of Europe, it has weakened its reputation among others, according to Charles Miller, a senior lecturer in the Australian National University's School of Politics and International Relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It does draw the ire of many libertarian and American conservatives, especially around the tech industry.\"\n\n\n\nUS tech giants push back\n\nThe strongest opposition to the ban has come from the United States technology sector, where industry groups representing Meta, Netflix, Disney, Alphabet and others have lodged formal complaints with the US Trade Representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Elon Musk's and the Peter Thiels of the tech world who have the ear of the Trump administration \u2014 they do not like this at all and I think it's [been] underestimated how much it could actually become a problem for relations between Australia and the United States,\" Miller said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US-based Computer & Communications Industry Association has raised \"serious concerns for industry about freedom of expression and information,\" saying such a framework \"risks applying disproportionate penalties to US firms, while overbroad and blanket restrictions could stifle creativity\".\n\n\n\nWhile Archer said those arguments reflect the commercial interests at stake, she acknowledged that the ban could excessively restrict how young people access news and participate in civic life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[People under 16] largely get their information through social media \u2026 That's been an avenue that they have been able to use and that's not going to be open to them in as much detail or depth as it has been,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lobby group also criticised Australia's new streaming investment rules, which will require major platforms to spend either 10 per cent of local expenditure or 7.5 per cent of Australian revenue on Australian-made programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother US lobby body, the International Intellectual Property Alliance, said there was \"no evidence\" the Australian market required intervention to sustain local production.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has described the social media ban as a world first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In one week, Australia will become the first country in the world to ban under 16's from having social media accounts,\" communications minister Annika Wells told the National Press Club last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as 'behavioural cocaine'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Through one reform, more kids will have their time back to learn an instrument or a language, or walk their dog, master a torpedo punt or the perfect lob pass.\"\n\n\n\nSecurity, culture politics and the alliance with Washington\n\nThe fallout from Australia's social media ban is now intersecting with shifts in United States security thinking, where cultural and speech regulation is increasingly being treated as a strategic issue, experts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiller pointed to the recently released US national security strategy, which he said contains significant \"culture war content\", despite its traditional focus on military threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although you would think it's security in terms of missiles, guns, bombs and military aggression, you actually find that there's an awful lot in it which might be described as culture war content,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meta admits there may be mistakes as it brings teenager social media ban forward\n\nOne example is the way the strategy frames European content regulation as a free speech threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The document advocates for the United States to pull away from Europe because of what they describe as European countries infringing on freedom of speech,\" he said, citing restrictions on social media content and Brussels' recent fining of X, which Musk owns.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile those issues may appear distant from conventional security concerns, Miller said they now carry strategic weight within the Trump administration and the US tech sector.\n\n\n\n\"It seems rather strange to us that they would become security issues,\" he said, \"but in the mindset of the Trump administration \u2014 and especially its supporters in the tech industry \u2014 they actually can become a problem for security relations as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said there was no current indication the Australian ban itself had become a flashpoint in the alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But similar policies pursued by European countries are now finding their way into the rhetoric of American policymakers towards Europe,\" he added, warning the same dynamics could eventually extend to Australia.\n\n\n\n",

So the three rate cuts which are already flowing, which the Reserve Bank has said today the benefits are not yet fully felt, that is providing welcome relief to Australians with a mortgage who are doing it tough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Treasurer Ted O\u2019Brien says the RBA decision to hold rates demonstrates that the federal government has failed to manage the economy effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has described the lack of rate relief as tragic news ahead of Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201dThe average Australian mortgage holder is paying $1,800 more in interest every single month compared to when the Coalition was in government. That won't change. In fact, next year, it's likely to get worse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian Government has delivered a historic apology to the state's First Nations people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition refused to back the apology, because the wording mentions treaty, which the Liberal Party has vowed to repeal within 100 days if it wins office.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Premier Jacinta Allan has told Parliament she hopes that together with the state's truth telling and treaty process, the apology will help unite Victorians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the Laws, the policies and the decisions of this Parliament, and those that came before it - laws that took land, removed children, broke families and tried to erase culture - we say sorry. For the tears shed in the dark, for the silence that shadowed their years, for the childhood taken and never returned, for the Stolen Generations, we say sorry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military has launched a wave of strikes in southern Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo casualties have been immediately reported but Lebanon's state news agency says that Israeli warplanes carried out a series of strikes throughout the south.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military says it was targetting a Hezbollah training compound, military infrastructure and a rocket launch site.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strikes come less than a week after both Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to a military committee monitoring the ceasefire struck between Israel and Hezbollah in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nCambodia's defence ministry says at least six Cambodian civilians have been killed in renewed clashes along the country's border with Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhnom Penh's defence ministry says two civilians deaths happened when the Thai military fired into the border province of Banteay Meanchey overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thai army says one soldier has been killed and 18 others wounded since clashes broke out on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sydney, Kanit Utitabud has spoken to SBS Thai about his concerns for family in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just got off the phone with my younger brother. He said the explosions started around 4 am. The roof was shaking with each blast. People are scared. There\u2019s no sense of safety at all. And when political interests whether local or national get entangled with one side or the other, it\u2019s ordinary people who pay the price. Families on both sides are suffering. Some are even related to each other. The displacement, the uncertainty the impact on people\u2019s lives is enormous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading figures from across the political spectrum have gathered to farewell one of Australia's most notorious kingmakers: Labor powerbroker Graham Richardson.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the mourners at the state funeral service in Sydney's St James\u2019 Church, along with one of his Liberal predecessor Tony Abbott and ex-Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham Richardson had a controversial career as a Labor senator and minister during the Hawke and Keating governments, and remained a prominent figure after his retirement from politics, despite being embroiled in several scandals stretching back decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese has told the service that Mr Richardson had nevertheless commanded respect across political lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Graham was not perfect, he was always very direct. That much was evident in the famously self aware title of his memoir - \u2018Whatever it takes\u2019. He had that rogue's charm. An instinctive capacity to disarm, no secret that he played his politics hard. Very hard.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nSoccer fans are awaiting confirmation following reports linking Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah with a potential January move to Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation has intensified after the 33-year-old voiced frustration with Liverpool manager Arne Slot following Saturday\u2019s 3\u20133 draw with Leeds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Al-Hilal\u2019s club grounds, players and supporters like Abdulrahman Al-Harbi say Salah could boost the team\u2019s title hopes.\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News In its recent data for the September quarter, the consumer price index was at 3.2 per cent, above the Reserve Bank's inflation target band of 2 to 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderlying, or trimmed mean inflation, the RBA's preferred measure of price movements, rose 1 per cent over the September quarter \u2014 higher than its forecast.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual trimmed mean inflation rose to 3 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in the June quarter, marking the first time annual trimmed mean inflation had risen since December 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA will meet again in February, when it will have its first opportunity to change the cash rate in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf inflationary pressures continue to build, some analysts say the bank could be forced to hike interest rates as soon as February.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Should inflation numbers published in January show a continued rise, the possibility of an interest rate hike at the February meeting remains on the table to ensure inflation returns to target in a reasonable time frame,\" economist at Monash University Isaac Gross said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Energy bill rebates to be axed in cost of living relief 'shift'\n\nDomain chief economist Nicola Powell said the turnaround in rate expectations could help take heat out of the rapid price growth in the housing market during the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, it doesn't solve the deeper affordability issues,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mortgage holders are still managing repayments that are significantly higher than they were before the tightening cycle began in 2022.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outlook for households and businesses has soured markedly from a few months ago, when bonds traders were pricing in one or two more cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIG market analyst Tony Sycamore said: \"This isn\u2019t the statement of a central bank with one hand hovering over the rate hike button,\" adding that CPI data points to a broader rise in inflation \"part of which could prove persistent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "MUSIC\n\nPerfume Genius \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nForum Melbourne, December 4 Mike Hadreas, better known as Perfume Genius, has a chameleon\u2019s voice, switching deftly from shimmering falsetto to an otherworldly, wavering register that seems to emanate from deep within his body. It\u2019s a voice that\u2019s at turns full of yearning and subtly rendered emotion or dripping with swagger and sensuality. Perfume Genius (left) performs with Aldous Harding at the Forum Melbourne on December 4. Credit: Richard Clifford All this was on full display at the Forum, where Hadreas, who has forged a career making mesmerising, impressionistic music for the queer and queer-adjacent, arrives on stage like a postmodern Saint Sebastian, ready to martyr himself to art. The tour comes off the back of his recently released seventh studio album, Glory, a work that puts his soul-baring lyrics in dialogue with layers of richly textured, cinematic instrumentation. Glory was largely written during lockdown and is a product of the uncertainty of those times: its animating themes are grief, anxiety, isolation. Despite this, it is not a depressing record, but rather something transcendent.\n\nThe show puts Hadreas\u2019 range on display, as he moves effortlessly from the propulsive, emotionally charged suffering of In a Row to the plaintive and tender piano ballad Me & Angel. One of the most arresting moments arrives early when, in a world debut, Hadreas invites New Zealand\u2019s Aldous Harding on stage to perform No Front Teeth. Already an album stand-out, the duet takes on new emotional resonance in this live performance, as Harding\u2019s gossamer vocals soar to the Forum\u2019s highest reaches and the song builds to a flaring, guitar-heavy climax. It is a rare treat for the audience and something unlikely to be repeated any time soon. Perfume Genius is a bodily performer. Credit: Richard Clifford Elsewhere, Hadreas pulls crowd-pleasing hits from the Perfume Genius back catalogue, from the deliciously camp Slip Away to the eminently danceable On the Floor (its potential goes sadly unfulfilled as Melbourne audiences simply do not dance). Otherside delivers another show highlight, as Hadreas makes inventive use of silence and negative space before unleashing beautiful aural chaos. The encore comprises two covers \u2013 Big Star\u2019s Kangaroo and Mazzy Star\u2019s Fade into You \u2013 before the show closes with the exhilarating and defiant celebration of queer selfhood, Queen. Hadreas is a bodily performer, contorting his limbs and executing gravity-defying back bends as he sings, though these objectively quite taxing moves seem to come to him as easily as breathing. He has a dancer\u2019s grace and a showman\u2019s unerring self-confidence. Yet you get the sense that everything he does on stage is for himself first: the audience is merely there as witness.\n\nReviewed by Nadia Bailey\n\nMUSIC\n\nMelbourne Women\u2019s International Jazz Festival\n\nAshling O\u2019Farrell / Virago with Flora Carbo \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Jazzlab, December 7 Sonja Horbelt must be some kind of conjuror. The program for this year\u2019s Melbourne Women\u2019s International Jazz Festival \u2013 which Horbelt has directed for many years \u2013 is particularly impressive, with numerous acts from overseas and interstate, plus several premieres and special collaborations. Flora Carbo with Virago. Yet the budget for the 2025 festival is actually smaller than the (already slim) budget for last year\u2019s event. Somehow, Horbelt has juggled funding sources, artist schedules and well-timed visits by expat musicians to assemble a genuinely enticing line-up. Sunday\u2019s double bill began with an engaging set by 21-year-old trombonist and vocalist Ashling O\u2019Farrell, the VCA\u2019s \u201cNew Horizons\u201d artist for 2025. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s tone on both trombone and vocals was suffused with an appealing warmth, augmented by the sensitive accompaniment of her rhythm section.\n\nThen came the unveiling of a newly commissioned work that was years in the planning, but which came together in less than a fortnight. Local saxophonist and composer Flora Carbo met American percussionist Sofia Carbonara in 2019, and \u2013 after Carbonara moved to Melbourne \u2013 the pair began dreaming of a full-length collaboration. That dream came to fruition last month, when Carbonara\u2019s US-based Virago quartet flew to Australia to develop and rehearse a work written for them by Carbo, to be premiered at the festival. Loading Combining intricately notated parts with passages of free-form spontaneity, the as-yet-untitled piece made the most of the group\u2019s unusual instrumentation: two alto saxophones, violin, cello and vibraphone. The suite opened with quivering harmonics from Carbonara\u2019s vibraphone, beckoning the other instruments to join them and coalesce into a single, trembling note. Gradually the players began to diverge, creating a mournful dissonance as Magnolia Rohrer\u2019s violin and Wesley Hornpetrie\u2019s cello slid away from BethAnne Kunert\u2019s sax, and Carbo\u2019s mini drum machine added a subtle, syncopated heartbeat. In other sections, minimalist repetition created pulsating waves where saxes, strings and vibes moved in deft interlocking patterns, before dissolving in a swirl of improvised abstraction or settling into a glade of delicate, folk-like serenity. At times challenging, at times strikingly beautiful, this was the kind of ambitious and compelling work that festivals are made for.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas\n\nMUSIC\n\nNo\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAustralian Brandenburg Orchestra, Melbourne Recital Centre, December 6 Brimming with festive cheer, this year\u2019s edition of the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra\u2019s Christmas offering took on a Spanish flavour. This musical accent honoured Tommie Andersson, the orchestra\u2019s foundation theorbo and baroque guitar principal, who is making his final appearances with the ABO this tour after delighting audiences for nearly 40 years. This year\u2019s edition of the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra\u2019s Christmas offering took on a Spanish flavour. Credit: Laura Manariti Under the irrepressibly energetic direction of Paul Dyer, the orchestra and Brandenburg Choir were joined by guests Argentinian mezzo-soprano Maria Eugenia Nieva and Australian classical guitarist Andrew Blanch. Wearing a full-length bright red dress with a side slit, Nieva exuded plenty of Latin sensuality. Her strong, dark-chocolate mezzo voice animated a variety of numbers from the traditional carol Ri\u00fa Ri\u00fa Chi\u00fa, through Gioia & Amore by Spanish renaissance composer Soto de Langa and Nana from Six Popular Spanish Songs by Manuel de Falla to Santa la noche, an arrangement of Adolphe Adam\u2019s beloved classic O Holy Night.\n\nBlanch, who featured prominently in the program, was especially brilliant in Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Leyenda, arranged to showcase the simmering passion of the guitar\u2019s rapid-fire flamenco technique. Once again, the Brandenburg Choir brought sheer delight to the choral aspect of No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! with crisp ensemble work and crystalline diction. Between the customary bookends, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, and O Come, All ye Faithful, came some English schmaltz courtesy of John Rutter and Philip Stopford, as well as an intense account of the Kyrie from Palestrina\u2019s Missa Papae Marcelli. In chamber formation, the Brandenburgs themselves were in top form, bringing joyous dynamism to Monn\u2019s Sinfonia in G and whimsy to an arrangement of God Rest ye Merry, Gentlemen. Andersson\u2019s own solos and his poignant accompaniment of Stille Nacht (Silent Night) with its original Austrian lilt mirrored his quiet but impressive dedication. No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! continues to be a distinctive but deservedly popular Christmas tradition.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nParcels: LOVED Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSidney Myer Music Bowl, December 4 I dare you to stand still at a Parcels show. From the minute they hit the stage, the band\u2019s blend of electro-pop and disco-pop rhythms has the crowd possessed, grooving along to the psychedelic funky beat. The Australian five-piece indie band formed in Byron Bay in 2014, and made the spontaneous move to Berlin that year. They have played some high-profile gigs in 2025, including Coachella and Glastonbury. This weekend, their national tour concludes in Sydney with two gigs on the steps of the Opera House. It\u2019s hard to stand still at a Parcels show. Credit: Martin Philbey The band experiments with many different sounds across the set. Opening with Tobeloved, they show off their signature harmonies, reminiscent of The Beach Boys. It\u2019s clear how Berlin club culture has influenced their music when they perform Gamesofluck, the stage lit with an electric blue as the keys and guitar pulse. They performed Overnight, a single co-produced and co-written with Daft Punk after they attended Parcels\u2019 first-ever show in Paris in 2016; the duo\u2019s electronic influence is evident in the live sound.\n\nFinallyover, their final song, has a much more mellow, retro rock feel like The Beatles. They perform a lengthy instrumental track which feels improvised, exerting riffs that resemble the disco energy of Boney M and AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck. Parcels in full flight. Credit: Martin Philbey \u201cI know we are a lot of people, but we move as one tonight,\u201d says one of the band, indistinguishable in the moody lighting, and that collective feeling carries through, maintaining a chill vibe across the entire set. During Summerinlove, the crowd leans into the sexiness, with footage of couples kissing in the front row projected onto a heart-shaped kiss cam on the screen above. It\u2019s clear the band are having just as much fun as the crowd. Patrick Hetherington\u2019s foot pounds the stage as Jules Crommelin\u2019s hips thrust against his guitar and Noah Hill\u2019s neck jerks back and forth like a chicken. The band seemed to have as much fun as their energetic audience. Credit: Martin Philbey\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of euphoria that fills the atmosphere at the all-ages concert. Like a rave, the infectious beats travel through your ears and all the way to your feet. The band asks tech staff to light up the crowd, as they peer into the masses extending up the theatre and across the green of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. As Crommelin perches at the end of the stage, he says: \u201cJust going to take a second to take this all in.\u201d What a start to the summer.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar THEATRE\n\nSoul of Possum \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until December 13 A few months ago, after nearly 10 years of consultation, parliament passed Treaty legislation for Aboriginal Victorians. It\u2019s the first treaty of its kind in Australia and one that not only acknowledges past injustices but also commits to returning decision-making powers to Aboriginal communities. Presented within this context, this latest staging of Soul of Possum serves as a potent and topical reminder of the past that still needs present-day reckoning. Soul of Possum is based on the experiences of the playwright\u2019s ancestors. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nBased on the personal histories of playwright Brodie Murray\u2019s ancestors (in particular his father and grandfather), the play is a taut reenactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and members of an Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. With a few cast changes, Soul of Possum\u2019s latest iteration follows a successful season at Castlemaine State Festival and Yirramboi Festival in 2021. It\u2019s 1853 in Wamba Wamba Country and Marnuu (Balla Neba) is troubled by his dreams; the voice of Possum predicts wide-scale destruction by a hostile force, a devastation of both people and wildlife. But his fellow warriors Gundi (Wimiya Woodley) and Barru (Murray) are sceptical and mock his warnings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a steamboat moored at the river, with a military expedition about to disembark to open up the country for \u201cglorious empire\u201d. It\u2019s a story most of us should know; this first-contact skirmish between two parties who are completely alien to the other\u2019s customs and cultures, and the resulting and continuing legacy of settler occupation. The play asks us to imagine what it was actually like in the initial round of invasion and resistance, a pattern that would repeat itself across the land. The play is a taut reenactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and the Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nThe stage is sparse except for a large projection of the riverbank at the back, two platforms on the left that serve as the steamboat and a clump of river reeds, a tree and a campfire to the right. Loading Preview night brought some rushed dialogue from the trio of warriors that should hopefully settle for the rest of the season. Maybe they feel there\u2019s no time to waste: under Beng Oh\u2019s direction, the 70-minute narrative moves fast, with the plight of both sets of white and blackfellas played out in alternate scenes before they finally meet. What makes Soul of Possum interesting is that it dramatises the in-fighting among each group. The First Nations Australians lose valuable time arguing about what to do with the threat of territorial trespass while the English marauders \u2013 Captain Gibbons (Leigh Scully), Lieutenant Bankes (Gabriel Partington), Dr Wilkins (Kevin Dee) and Irish convict Yates (Luke Mason) \u2013 have their own on-board power conflicts to contend with. All four characters are performed with ease and conviction. There\u2019s an earnestness about this play and some unnecessary repetition in the script. The ending that brings us back to the present day also seems a bit too expository after everything we\u2019ve witnessed. Nonetheless, Soul of Possum does manage to take us into the crossfire of colonial violence in its short, sharp stage time.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nSoul of Possum was reviewed from a preview performance.",

    "text": "This is not the first time Trump has had to pay farmers compensation for his tariff. During the trade war in his first term, he handed out $US23 billion of aid. The farmers would, you\u2019d assume, prefer to be able to trade freely rather than rely on government charity. Loading Trump and his officials have described the payments as a \u201cbridge\u201d to tide the farmers over until China delivers on its promises, even though the experience of the 2020 \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, in which China made similar promises that it didn\u2019t meet, suggests there\u2019s a possibility that it will be a bridge to nowhere. It\u2019s consistent, however, with the administration\u2019s broader assertions that Americans only have to wait \u2013 initially it was supposed to be this year, now it\u2019s next year and beyond \u2013 for the benefits of the tariffs to flow. The administration has previously rolled back tariffs on coffee, bananas, tomatoes and other foods that the US doesn\u2019t produce in significant quantities in an attempt to blunt the impact of tariffs-induced spikes in prices and the cost of living for US households\n\nNow it is subsidising its own agricultural production, while blaming the Biden administration and other countries for the losses of markets and the affordability crisis for middle and lower income household in the US that its own policies have created. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be able to connect the dots between the cause and the effect. The hardship being experienced by US farmers isn\u2019t only due to the closure of the Chinese market to their products after the April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. It\u2019s not just a revenue problem. Their input costs have risen sharply because fertiliser prices and farm machinery prices, among other items, have also jumped because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The administration lowered the tariffs on some fertilisers last month in an implicit recognition of their impact, although Trump this week threatened \u201cvery severe\u201d tariffs on Canadian potash in order to boost domestic production of fertilisers. About 95 per cent of Canada\u2019s potash is exported, with about 50 per cent of those export volumes directed to the US. A tariff on potash would flow through to another hike in farm costs. Farm machinery prices have risen because Trump slapped 50 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium and tariffs on other imported items used in their manufacture. About a quarter of the components in a John Deere tractor are imported.\n\nTrump, predictably, blames Joe Biden\u2019s environmental rules for the rising cost of farm machinery and has said he will wind them back. \u201cYou buy it, it\u2019s got so much equipment on it for the environmental, it doesn\u2019t do anything except it makes the equipment much more expensive and much more complicated to work,\u201d he said on Tuesday. John Deere has said that Trump\u2019s tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminium, will cost it $US600 million this year. It has laid off about 240 workers this year in response. The other challenge for US farmers is labour. Trump\u2019s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants has produced a shortage of labour and forced up labour costs. More than 40 per cent of US crop workers lack legal status. So, the tariffs have closed markets and reduced farm income while the tariffs and immigration policies have driven up costs. The bailout might help some farmers limp on into next year, but they aren\u2019t a long-term response to the bind the farmers find themselves in.\n\nThe lost markets, higher fertiliser and machinery costs and shrunken pool of labour are structural changes to the economics of American farms that can\u2019t easily, or readily, be unwound. Loading Even if China does buy more soybeans and other agricultural commodities, it will buy much less than it did before Trump decided tariffs had magical qualities, able to fix the US trade deficit, rebuild the US manufacturing base, reduce US deficits and debt, fund $2000 \u201cdividends\u201d to households and even enable the abolishment of US income taxes. Oh, and bail out farmers. China helped build the infrastructure in Brazil than has enabled it to displace the US as its major supplier of soybeans. It has also begun buying the beans from Argentina, much to the chagrin of the US farmers, who saw their administration give that country a $US20 billion bailout package that helped it sell up to $US7 billion of soybeans to China. Having been burned twice by Trump\u2019s tariffs, China will maintain the diversity of supply it has helped create. Its market, and those of other countries hit by the tariffs, will never be as open to US producers as they once were.",

While the story and its critical tone in highlighting Wells\u2019 use of taxpayer funds was arguably fair, she made the trip to promote the ban News Corp says it was central in establishing. Ultimately, the exclusive was retracted after a few hours online. A Google search from Wednesday afternoon, the day after the story was published. Credit: The Sydney Morning Herald However, by that time, the story had already been shared widely within a Press Gallery WhatsApp chat containing almost 200 journalists. The link to the story went dead and remains so. With no live link come Wednesday morning, it was then reported by 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham as an \u201cexclusive\u201d just hours before Wells was due to appear at the National Press Club, a week before the ban was due to go live. The story snowballed into a barrage of questions for Wells, and the subsequent expenses scandal that followed.\n\nClick on the story, and it was nowhere to be found. Credit: SMH Since then, there has been a slew of stories published regarding Wells\u2019 use of taxpayer funds for trips for her and her family (it\u2019s worth noting that all of these trips appear to be within the guidelines). They\u2019ve come from multiple media sources including this masthead, The Australian Financial Review, Guardian Australia, ABC and other outlets. It was not until Friday evening, three days after the initial news.com.au article, that The Daily Telegraph wrote the first story published by a News Corp metro masthead about the unfolding government crisis, appearing in its Saturday paper. The Australian and Sky News Australia covered the story on the day of the Press Club appearance, and have done so since, but they were not involved in the Let Them Be Kids campaign. A number of sources, both in the Press Gallery and in the federal opposition, have noted the softer tone from some News Corp outlets since the expenses saga has unfolded.\n\nThe Let Them Be Kids campaign continued on The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page on Friday, three days after the initial expenses story was published by news.com.au. Credit: News Corp On Sunday, the News Corp tabloids\u2019 national weekend political editor James Campbell defended Wells in a piece titled \u201cLay off Anika, she\u2019s done absolutely nothing wrong\u201d, exonerating her for each of the then-reported uses of public funds for personal events. The coverage has turned more critical in the days since, however. On Background tried to speak to Carroll and Pilling directly about why such an important exclusive was pulled. The comment we got came from a corporate spin doctor. A News Corp spokesperson confirmed the story was removed, but said all the company\u2019s publications have been covering the debate about Wells\u2019 travel expenses closely and prominently on their print front pages and digital home pages. They also rejected any suggestion of government interference or executive influence.\n\n\u201cWith one particular story, there was an editorial decision to review its publication. All decisions on editorial coverage have been made by editorial independent of government interference or executive directive,\u201d the spokesperson said. The world-first social media ban came into effect on Wednesday, and has been described as a legacy-shaping policy for the Labor Party and for Wells. It was prompted and has been championed by the News Corp campaign, alongside a campaign \u201c36 Months\u201d led by Nova presenter Michael \u201cWippa\u201d Wipfli, arguing for the minimum age for social media usage be raised from 13 to 16. Nova is also owned privately by News Corp chair Lachlan Murdoch. \u201cLet Them Be Kids\u201d and \u201c36 Months\u201d were both launched in May 2024, the former splashed across the front pages of the company\u2019s metro tabloid newspapers at the time and in the lead-up to the ban going live this week. Both launched petitions urging the government to impose a minimum age to access social media. The tabloids\u2019 homepages also featured countdowns to the ban going live this week.\n\nOn Sunday, The Daily Telegraph detailed the inception of policy itself and how it successfully lobbied this government. It started with an \u201cintimate dinner at the Lodge\u201d in September 2024 between Emma Mason, the mother of Matilda Rosewarne who took her own life as a 15-year-old after sustained online bullying; Pilling; Courier Mail editor Chris Jones; Albanese and his partner, Jodie Haydon; and Albanese\u2019s press secretary, Fiona Sugden. \u201cPilling found herself arguing for a social media ban up to the age of 16, rather than 14 or 15. At some point, it occurred to her that she and Albanese were not talking about the question of a ban. They were talking about the details of a ban,\u201d the story on Sunday read. \u201cI knew then that this was probably going to happen,\u201d Pilling told The Daily Telegraph. \u201cThat was a pretty pivotal moment in the process.\u201d Pilling then went on to front and lead the campaign, which ultimately resulted in the bill that comes into effect on Wednesday. If you or anyone you know needs support, call Lifeline on 131 114 or Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636. Read the full and final \u201cOn Background\u201d column for the year this Friday.",

    "text": "It means selectors will be able to field their most experienced and arguably strongest attack of the series in Adelaide, which is staging a rare day Test.\n\nCummins\u2019 impending return strengthens an Australian attack that has had little trouble claiming 20 wickets in each of the first two Tests.\n\nHis return had been flagged by coach and selector Andrew McDonald on Tuesday but has now been set in stone after being named on Wednesday in the 15-person squad for the third Ashes Test in Adelaide.\n\n\u201cPat will be back in the squad, he will be available, and that creates a different balance to our attack,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cBarring anything else happening in the next week, we\u2019ll be expecting Pat to be tossing the coin and putting the blazer on.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any match opportunities for Pat. This is something we\u2019ve done with Pat before, off longish lay-offs, where we\u2019ve put in some time into rebuilding his body. He\u2019s simulated pretty much what a match will look like out there with multiple spells.\n\n\u201cWe feel as though he\u2019ll be as best prepared as he can be. He was well ahead of where we thought he would be at, and it created a real live conversation for Brisbane. The skill readiness, the loads, how he was pulling up \u2026 it was debated a lot, leading into that Test match. So with that in mind, seeing him further advanced, we feel he\u2019ll be really well-placed for the challenges of Adelaide.\u201d\n\nCummins\u2019 availability will put the squeeze on Gabba hero Michael Neser and newcomer Brendan Doggett.",

    "text": "Sports minister Anika Wells is backing herself as a hard worker as pressure mounts over her use of taxpayer money for family travel.\n\nAnd Anthony Albanese is behind her, saying she \"absolutely\" has his full support to continue in cabinet.\n\nMs Wells referred herself to the parliamentary expenses authority after it was revealed she repeatedly billed the public purse for chauffeured cars and family reunions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"I am incredibly serious about my work. I work really hard, and I try really hard every single day to discharge my duties,\" she told ABC Brisbane on Wednesday.\n\n\"I absolutely understand, appreciate and agree that parliamentarians entitlements should be scrutinised.\n\n\"That's why, for absolute transparency, I've always disclosed everything. I have always followed the rules, and I'm happy for the independent regulator to have another audit of my travels.\"\n\nVarious travel allowances are available to ministers and MPs, including a family reunion allowance into which Ms Wells and others have dipped.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAsked if her husband should be able to enjoy big sporting games, Ms Wells said the family travel guidelines weren't new.\n\n\"No one expects any forgiveness for the political class. I understand that,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, I always think about how this is going to look to people when we make decisions about when we use the family travel entitlement.\"\n\nMs Wells has referred herself to the parliamentary expenses authority over the incident. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nMs Wells charged taxpayers almost $1000 for a chauffeur for seven hours the day she attended the Australian Open in 2023 and more than $1200 for nine hours the day of the NRL and NRLW grand finals in 2022, according to the parliamentary expenses register.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe cabinet minister had her electorate office fitted with a secure communications facility in October 2024 when she was sports and aged care minister, despite a similar room being about a 20 minute drive away.\n\nThe prime minister dismissed the suggestion that Ms Wells should be criticised or sanctioned for claiming the allowances.\n\n\"A sports minister attending sports events should not be surprising,\" Mr Albanese told ABC Radio.\n\nHe also fired back at the opposition - who claim Ms Wells has rorted the system - by reminding them how the allowances framework was set up.\n\n\"We have an arm's length approach to this that was put in place by the former government after Sussan Ley had to resign after going to the Gold Coast and property purchases,\" he told Nine's Today show.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Anika Wells has done the right thing, but she's been out there doing her job in promoting this important legislation.\"\n\nThe current opposition leader resigned from her position as a minister in the Turnbull government after it was revealed in 2017 she had used taxpayer funds to buy a property on the Gold Coast.\n\nThat led to MPs and senators being required to report their expenses to an independent watchdog monthly.\n\nMs Wells first came under fire over flights for herself and two others that cost almost $100,000.\n\nThe embattled minister flew to New York during the United Nations General Assembly, where she spruiked Australia's social media ban for children under 16.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is behind Ms Wells, saying she \"absolutely\" has his full support. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nOther politicians have also faced scrutiny over their expenses, including Trade Minister Don Farrell for claiming more than $100,000 on family reunion travel since 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOpposition communications spokeswoman Melissa McIntosh has defended her decision to fly herself and her son to Queensland, where he was taking part in Australian National Judo Championships on the Gold Coast.\n\nShe said she supported the rules being restricted or dropped to scale back entitlements.\n\n\"If you don't make some sort of change this is going to continue to happen, people are going to stretch the rules,\" the coalition frontbencher told the ABC.\n\n\"The prime minister should show some leadership on this. He should stand up and and make change.\"",
