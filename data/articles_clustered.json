(AFL Photos via Getty Images: Michael Willson)\n\nThrough it all, the 27-year-old knew something was not right.\n\nShe was only diagnosed with endometriosis three years ago.\n\nIt is a condition where tissue, such as the lining of the uterus, grows in other places and can cause serious pain.\n\nIt affects one in seven women, with new research putting diagnosis at around five years, instead of six and a half.\n\nSmith's diagnosis took a bit longer, despite speaking up about her symptoms.\n\nShe said the responses often came down to having a bad period that she would just have to live with.\n\nConditioned to push through pain\n\nIt is a sentiment AFLW clubs and other codes are set on changing.\n\nSports exercise and pelvic health physiotherapist Jess Cunningham has been working with the Giants to help identify players who may have endometriosis and put them on a path to treatment.\n\nIt took around seven seasons for Smith's diagnosis to come about. (AFL Photos via Getty Images: Michael Willson)\n\nShe has done similar work with AFLW clubs Geelong and the Gold Coast, Football Australia and Rugby Australia, and the Giants and NSW Swifts Super Netball teams.\n\n\"We screen all the athletes around menstrual health, pelvic health and breast health,\" Cunningham said.\n\n\"From there, we can find out who's flagging for those certain areas and then put in the processes, whether that be working with their existing team doctor, dietician or physios, facilitating specialist referrals or using my pelvic health physio services as well.\"\n\nCunningham said some athletes were reporting significant endometriosis symptoms.\n\n\"Whether it's period pain or [issues with] bladder, bowel or sexual function \u2014 they just thought that was their normal,\" she said.\n\nJess Cunningham has been working as a female athlete health consultant with the Giants. (ABC Sport: Jack Ailwood)\n\nIt took around seven seasons for Smith's endometriosis to be identified, but she was quick to point out that delay was no-one's fault, it simply was not discussed.\n\n\"Once we had Jess come on board and be open about the fact that irregular periods, severe cramping, that's not okay, that really hit home for me,\" Smith said.\n\nCunningham said along with trying to avoid stigma around their menstrual cycles, athletes could under-report symptoms.\n\n\"They may have a family member who has similar symptoms that have been considered normal,\" she said.\n\n\"It also might be they don't want to report it for fear of potentially not being selected or included.\n\n\"And often I find with athletes, if they were reporting six out of 10 for knee pain, that would be something they would flag.\n\n\"But if you ask them how painful their periods can be, they'll often think that a six out of 10 pain is okay.\"\n\nSmith has had surgery to address endometriosis, and says it has improved her performance. (Getty Images: James Worsfold)\n\nThe impact of endometriosis on performance\n\nCommon symptoms of endometriosis can include fatigue, period pain that interferes with daily life, pain during ovulation, pain in the pelvis, lower back or legs, pain when going to the toilet, pain during or after sex, and heavy or irregular bleeding.\n\nEndometriosis Australia medical director Associate Professor Anusch Yazdani said it was important to know that period pain was not normal.\n\n\"I think pain interfering with your life is never normal,\" Dr Yazdani said.\n\n\"Pain that stops you from going to work, stops you from going to university, needs to be investigated.\"\n\nAnusch Yazdani wants women to know that period pain is not normal. (Supplied)\n\nEndometriosis can have a big impact on an elite athlete's performance.\n\nSmith was often in pain when she needed to run or cycle hard, for about five to six minutes.\n\n\"Any time there was a time trial, you knew you were going to be in severe pain,\" she said.\n\n\"With that high intensity activity over a sustained period, it got to the point where the cramps were so severe I had to stop.\"\n\nGiants AFLW and netball head physiotherapist Gemma Vale said training was often modified to an athlete's comfort levels.\n\n\"There is a bit of a push for modifying training around different phases of the cycle,\" Vale said.\n\n\"But I think we do need to be very individualised in what they need, whether it's [adapting] volume of training [or] what they're lifting in the gym.\n\n\"It's more about [asking], 'How are you feeling today, what do you have the capacity for?'\"\n\nTraining is often modified to an athlete's comfort level. (Getty Images: Dylan Burns/AFL Photos)\n\nFighting the mental battle as well as the physical\n\nEndometriosis has typically only been diagnosed through a form of surgery called a laparoscopy.\n\nDr Yazdani said it no longer required that.\n\n\"We can make a very good diagnosis based on an ultrasound scan, but also on a lot of clinical presentation,\" he said.\n\nHowever, it is one of the mainstays of treatment, as it confirms a diagnosis while a surgeon removes tissue at the same time.\n\n\"It has a very good chance of reducing significant types of pain, for example, pain with intercourse, pain with periods,\" Dr Yazdani said.\n\n\"Other types of pain, it's less likely to help. So the bowel changes, the bladder changes, they all need to be addressed individually.\"\n\nThere were times Smith would only have two days in a month where she was not bleeding. (AAP: Darren England)\n\nSmith has had surgery and said she could now train harder and for longer.\n\n\"The symptoms have been so much better,\" she said.\n\n\"Now that I'm able to do those things with comfort, the ability to perform at that intensity for a longer period of time has impacted my performance.\"\n\nLooking forward, Smith wants to normalise conversations around women's health, so that others do not have to play through the pain like she did.\n\n\"Irregular periods, severe cramping, back pain, it isn't normal,\" she said.\n\n\"I guess as high achievers, people want to be like, 'I'm fine, I'm going to keep pushing', because you want to be the best you can.\n\n\"But that first step of acknowledging it is not normal and that we can do something to fix it, is important.\"",

(ABC Landline)\n\nMr Corish said a 60-hectare trial crop on his property at Condamine, 330 kilometres west of Brisbane, was a success \u2014 yielding 1.5 tonnes per hectare \u2014 even though there was nowhere in Queensland to process the grain.\n\nHe said he planned to grow more next season, adding to his rotation for the lighter, gravelly, Western Downs soil that was unsuitable for other crops.\n\n\"I can see canola taking up around that 15 to 20 per cent of the area, particularly on poor soil type areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Particularly those soil types that aren't suitable for sorghum or dry land cotton when it does get hot during our summer.\n\n\"It helps with some soil disease and sort of changes the soil structure a little bit.\"\n\nFor most of the season, growers could sell their canola for more than $700 per tonne \u2014 hundreds of dollars higher than other winter crops.\n\nMr Corish said canola's improved profitability added to its appeal as a rotation crop.\n\n\"The price of canola actually factors into the gross margin of the [entire] cropping system,\" he said.\n\nHe said at least four other growers in his region intended to trial canola for the first time next season.\n\nCanola prices have been stronger than other commodities this growing season. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\nWhy canola?\n\nIndependent Commodity Management market advisor Matthew Leeson said the canola market was a strong performer when compared to other broadacre crops grown in Queensland such as wheat and barley.\n\nHe said demand in the export market and seasonal conditions had boosted production in Queensland.\n\n\"We've seen an increase in demand globally, which has supported prices domestically,\" he said.\n\n\"Production really hasn't kept up with that.\"\n\nHe said global market volatility was also a factor.\n\n\"We've also got a trade spat between Canada and China at the moment, which is limiting the canola that Canada can ship,\" he said.\n\n\"That's moved demand to Australia.\"\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australian farmers planted 3.7 million hectares of canola in 2023-24, mostly in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.\n\nQueensland, by comparison, grew a total area of 7,036 hectares, but Mr Leeson said new varieties meant there was even more opportunity for that to grow.\n\n\"If we can get some more malleable varieties that can handle a warmer spring and the prices hold up, then it certainly does have a part in our rotation,\" he said.",

(Supplied: Snake Catcher Darling Downs 24/7)\n\n\"This October has been busier than last October,\" Mr Glasser said.\n\n\"It's been probably two every day, but then I've had up to six and then sometimes I've had to refer to another catcher if he was available.\n\n\"This October, I've had quite a few more eastern browns than [the usual] carpet pythons.\"\n\nSnakes in backyards have been the most common call-outs, but Mr Glasser said he also removed snakes from inside cars and houses.\n\nHe urges people to keep an eye on the reptile after they first spot it to avoid a surprise when the snake catcher shows up and it is missing.\n\n\"Quite often you go to the people's place and they're not there, they're inside having a cuppa or something,\" Mr Glasser said.\n\nThe eastern brown snake was found hiding inside a home at Vale View. (Supplied: Snake Catcher Darling Downs 24/7)\n\nAmbos 'ready' for increase in snakebite call-outs\n\nIn August, Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) recorded three snakebite presentations in the Darling Downs and south-west regions. That number jumped to 10 in September.\n\nWhile the official October data was yet to be finalised, QAS senior operations supervisor Peter Crooks said, with summer approaching, paramedics were prepared for an expected increase.\n\n\"It's something that's in the back of our mind, we're ready for any and all situations, but snakes in the warmer months do become active and move around, and we see a lot more bites and requests for service,\" Mr Crooks said.\n\n\"Previous years, like October last year \u2026 the Darling Downs saw 17 in total and, in November, [there were] eight in total and December [had] 22.\"\n\nPets also at risk\n\nHighfields vet Dr Alex Bailey said his clinic had been \"inundated\" with snake incidents at the start of October, with two to three confirmed cases on average a week.\n\nOne of those cases was Lottie, a golden retriever, who was brought in by her owner immediately after being bitten by a snake. She made a full recovery.\n\nLottie fully recovered after being bitten by a snake on the Darling Downs. (Supplied: Highfields Vet Surgery)\n\nDr Bailey said it was a good reminder that, while it can be difficult to determine if an animal has been bitten, there will be signs.\n\n\"If they have been bitten \u2026 things like sudden collapse, sitting, struggling to breathe or unable to get up, and things like that would be the main things,\" he said.\n\n\"Other things you can do is [check if] they might have pale gums and really big pupils in their eyes.\"\n\nDr Bailey said snake venom could act similarly in animals as it did in humans because \"they're both mammals\".\n\n\"With humans, often you know you've been bitten \u2026 whereas in dogs, they can't tell us that they've been bitten and we can catch it a little bit later and that's when we see the more profound effects of the venom working on their body with significant paralysis and things like that,\" he said.\n\n\"Another thing that often we find with dogs is that usually if a human gets bitten, it's a quick bite and the human moves away. Whereas, with a dog, they're going to bite back and often will attack the snake, and they have a bit of a fight, so there's probably multiple bites and a significant more amount of venom going into the body of the dog.\"\n\nTop tips if snakes are about\n\nQAS urged people to be vigilant when out and about in nature.\n\n\"Prevention is better than a cure when it comes to snakes,\" Mr Crooks said.\n\n\"Try and avoid them, wear long pants and clothes [and] enclosed shoes if you're walking through the long grass.\n\n\"Be aware of your surroundings, especially in rural areas like on farms and in gardens. They tend to hide amongst the leafy areas and a little bit of grass [so] you can't really see them.\"",

(ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"There are no true blacks in terms of flowers, but they get very close, but this is the darkest I've seen,\" she said.\n\n\"It's near black, a very, very dark purple.\"\n\nThis is just one of the hundreds of varieties of bearded irises Ms O'Grady grows on her property, at Ebden, on the banks of Lake Hume in north-east Victoria.\n\nIrises come in a broad spectrum of colours. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nShe has been specialising in bearded irises since 2018.\n\n\"There are probably less than a dozen growers left in Australia now, and it's not a common flower grown throughout Australia.\"\n\nCaitie O'Grady grows 800 varieties on her farm. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nAfter the flowers have bloomed, Ms O'Grady digs up the rhizomes and sell them across the country.\n\n\"They are extremely tough \u2014 we don't have town water so we had to choose a flower which is hardy.\n\n\"They can survive prolonged dry periods for months and they also love frosts.\"\n\nThe rhizome is sold on to other growers. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nFloriculture is on the rise in Victoria, and according to data from the state's department of agriculture, the sector's gross value is worth $1.2 billion.\n\nMs O'Grady said demand for her flowers was strong.\n\n\"We're supplying throughout Australia \u2014 we post the bare root rhizomes in March all the way up to Queensland.\"\n\nCaitie O'Grady says the flowers remind her of French cancan dancers. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nCatching the 'iris virus'\n\nThe iris flower is named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris.\n\nAnd there is no shortage of colour combinations.\n\nCaitie O'Grady has always had a love for growing flowers. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"We grow more than 800 different varieties of bearded iris, so there's certainly lots of colours,\" Ms O'Grady said.\n\nThe \"beard\" refers to the fuzzy, yellow stem that comes from the middle of the flower.\n\nThe \"beard\" is the yellow, fuzzy stem. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"I would describe a bearded iris as looking like a French cancan dancer \u2014 the falls look like ruffled skirts.\n\nYellow and purple bearded irises. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"Once people have started with one or two they see their beauty and the iris virus takes over.\n\n\"But there are worse addictions out there, so if I can buy a few more flowers then that's OK.\"\n\nThe \"black suited\" iris blooms towards the end of October.

(ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nA difficult year for towns\n\nAbout half an hour's drive away, Mark and Rebecca Ireland run the holiday park in the small coastal town of Cape Jaffa.\n\nThe town has faced its fair share of challenges, with storms damaging the jetty and leading to a closure of the town's marina.\n\nMr Ireland said perceptions of the algal bloom just added to the woes.\n\nCape Jaffa's jetty has been repaired, after sustaining damage in storms earlier this year. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\n\"There's a bit of a pre-conceived notion from a few people that the algae bloom is up here, but it's not,\" he said.\n\n\"We do keep telling people the bloom's not here, and fishing is great.\n\n\"Heading into summer, we hope we get a few more bookings start to come in, or it's going to make it a very difficult one.\"\n\nChris and Tracey Jensen became managers of the Kingston Foreshore Caravan Park earlier this year. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nVouchers a welcome boost\n\nAt nearby Kingston South East, caravan park managers Chris and Tracey Jensen took over operations of the park earlier this year.\n\nWhile they have not had anyone cancel bookings, some guests have asked questions about the bloom.\n\nMr Jensen said the state government's Coast is Calling vouchers have been helpful for the town.\n\n\"It's getting people in and around the state doing something, instead of gloom and doom,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a really good incentive from the government. I believe we've had about 50 applicants take up the deal.\"\n\nMark Ireland is hoping the summer period is busier in Cape Jaffa. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nWith the Cape Jaffa jetty repaired, and works to clear the marina entrance underway, Mr Ireland said he was looking forward to more bookings heading into summer.\n\n\"This time last year the phone was ringing a lot more \u2026 but all we can do is hope,\" he said.\n\nBack in Robe, the council is using naturally occurring foam at a local lake as an opportunity to let visitors know the town is algae-free.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the messaging is statewide and it does impact all of the state's coastline,\" Ms Traeger said.\n\nFor town's on the Limestone Coast like Kingston, tourism is important to the local economy. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nThe South Australian Tourism Commission said the majority of booking cancellations had come from travellers within South Australia.\n\n\"Parts of the Limestone Coast are included in the Coast is Calling travel voucher and Dining Cashback programs, which aim to boost visitation and economic activity along our state\u2019s coastline by South Australians,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nA ballot for a second round of Coast is Calling vouchers is set to open for registration in December.",

    "text": "The government used to be quite cosy with independent ACT senator David Pocock. That was back at the start, when it needed his vote.\n\nIn its second term, Labor only requires the Greens or the Coalition to pass contested legislation in the upper house. Now, Pocock has become an irritant for Labor, as he and other crossbenchers need to demonstrate their relevance in changed circumstances.\n\nPocock is calling out the government's gross lack of transparency. \"When the numbers were crunched on the last parliament, they were more secretive than the Morrison government,\" he says, describing this as \"one of the most secretive governments in the last 30 years\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Pocock led a spectacular revolt that united, in a rare display, the Coalition, Greens and other crossbenchers.\n\nThe government used to be very cosy with ACT independent senator David Pocock. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe immediate trigger issue was the government's refusal to release a report by former public service commissioner Lynelle Briggs into jobs for mates. The government commissioned the report in 2023, spurred by the fact that one of the \"teals\", Sophie Scamps, was planning a private member's bill.\n\nThe report, titled Review of Public Sector Board Appointments Processes, was completed the same year. But it has been sat on ever since, presumably because it is embarrassing for Labor. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher says, improbably, that the government is still working on the report. If it is, it must have started the work very late and presumably will be accelerating it.\n\nOn Wednesday, the non-government senators passed a motion to extend the Senate's hour-long question time, until the issue is resolved, by about half an hour, with the additional questions all to be asked by non-Labor senators. (In a chaotic Thursday afternoon, question time ran three and a half hours.)\n\nLabor accused of threats after Senate stunt The Senate has erupted after a stunt yesterday where the Coaliton, Greens and crossbench teamed up to pressure the government to release a secret report \u2014 with claims Labor is vowing retribution.\n\nThe government reacted furiously. The opposition said the leader of the House of Representatives, Tony Burke, told the manager of opposition business, Alex Hawke, that the government was considering depriving Coalition lower house members of their positions as deputy chairs on various committees.\n\nLiberal frontbencher James Paterson said \"the government's response is more like that of a petty authoritarian government than a democratic one\".\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt lashed Pocock on Thursday, accusing him of \"a dummy spit\". \"David Pocock was always in here lecturing the rest of us about the importance of Senate tradition and Senate convention, and he's just gone and chucked the toys out of the cot yesterday. So he should have a good, hard think about that.\"\n\nMurray Watt said Pocock \"chucked the toys out of the cot\" in leading a revolt against the government. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nThis incident is not just a bit of byplay. It's a test of strength between the Senate and the executive. Politically, it is important because it highlights a concerning feature of the Albanese government \u2014 its penchant for secrecy. While governments generally have secrecy as their default position, Labor came in promising to behave differently.\n\nObservers believe Anthony Albanese is the main driver of limiting information. We know for certain he is not a fan of freedom of information \u2014 the current bill for changes to FOI that the government has before parliament would (further) inhibit access to information about what is happening at senior levels of government.\n\nLabor plans to weaken FOI laws A new proposal would introduce a fee for Freedom of Information requests and tighten the rules around the release of documents related to government deliberations.\n\nThe inclination to secrecy is part of the government's disappointing record more generally on integrity issues, highlighted this week by the Centre for Public Integrity, an independent research institute chaired by Anthony Whealy, a respected legal figure.\n\nThe CPI issued \"The Albanese government's Integrity Report Card\", which showed poor results on various fronts.\n\nThe centre urges the government to \"reset course \u2014 to honour its commitments to transparency, respect for parliament, robust checks and balances, and action to stamp out corruption and undue influence\".\n\nThe CPI accuses the government of \"leaning into a culture of secrecy\", highlighting the flawed Freedom of Information Bill.\n\nLoading\n\nIt says the government has failed to rein in the power of lobbyists. One big thing that compromises both sides of politics is how political parties sell access to their senior figures for large sums. Labor has its Federal Labor Business Forum; the Liberals have their Australian Business Network. Companies sign up for meetings at party conferences and other events to get into decision-makers' ears. It is surely a distortion of democracy.\n\nFor an opposition to hold a government to account requires resources. The CPI report criticises the government's cut in the staff allocation it has provided to the opposition.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.\n\nAlbanese has been particularly arbitrary when it comes to resources for Senate crossbenchers. Instead of a general rule, some crossbenchers (including Pocock) have received more staff than others, according to prime ministerial preference. Labor defector Senator Fatima Payman was given minimal staff.\n\nThe CPI criticises that the scrutiny of Indigenous Affairs has been reduced by removing the previous dedicated day at Senate estimates to examine this area. The government also \"continues to exempt major executive instruments from parliamentary review\".\n\nOn the issue of \"frank and fearless advice\" from the public service, the CPI points to the government ignoring key recommendations from the Thodey review, which reported under the Morrison government \u2014 notably recommending changes to the appointment and tenure of departmental secretaries. These would strengthen the independence of the public service, the CPI says.\n\nAnd what of jobs for mates? The CPI says the government has made little progress on, and has little appetite for, \"one of Australia's most pressing integrity reforms\".\n\nKaty Gallagher says the government is still working on the report into jobs for mates. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nIt quotes Gallagher's words when she announced the Briggs inquiry \u2014 she said it was \"all about putting an end to the jobs for mates culture that defined the previous Morrison government's public sector appointments\".\n\nABC Politics in your inbox Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington\n\nUnder the Albanese government, \"appointments continue to be made without sufficient guardrails\", the CPI says. It points to the recent choice of the new head of the Office of National Intelligence, Kathy Klugman, who went straight from the Prime Minister's Office. (The government is enraged by this, seeing it as a slur, because she was a deputy secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs seconded to the Prime Minister's Office.)\n\nThe CPI also notes legislation for the Australian Centre for Disease Control \"establishes a major public office with no provision for merit-based appointment\".\n\nThe CPI calls for the release of the Briggs report and for the government to \"legislate transparent, merit-based appointment processes across the public sector\".\n\nThe ball's in the government's court.\n\nMichelle Grattan is a professorial fellow at the University of Canberra and chief political correspondent at The Conversation, where this article first appeared.",

He drowned in the big pool,\" she said, adding there wasn't a qualified lifeguard on duty when it happened.\n\nHer parents had only just moved from Mauritius to Heidelberg West, in Melbourne's north-east, to get better support for Jean-Pierre who was profoundly hearing-impaired.\n\n\"For him to just die months after migrating here, I can't even imagine what my parents would have been thinking and feeling,\" she said.\n\nThe Olympic Leisure Centre in Heidelberg West will close for good after nearly half a century in operation.

    "text": "ANZ's economics team has circulated their \"Australian Macro Weekly\" note, which says something interesting.\n\nIt looks back at Wednesday's inflation data (which came in much higher than expected), and the team says we ought to be aware that there was a bit of \"noise\" in the 'trimmed mean' measure of inflation, which may be giving a false sense of how strong inflation really is.\n\nHere's how they make their argument:\n\n\"In the wake of the CPI [result], the hurdle for any [interest rate] easing [from the Reserve Bank] this year is now very high and would likely require a further move higher in the unemployment rate (with an unfriendly mix of details) and a weak Q3 GDP.\n\n\"The most likely path for interest rates remains a final 25 basis point easing in the first half of 2026, albeit now with risk that the final rate cut we expect in February ends up occurring later (possibly May after the next two quarterly CPIs) or not at all.\n\n\"We are not yet inclined to remove that final easing from our forecasts, given:\n\n1) The recent drift higher in the unemployment rate\n\n2) The tendency (over some recent years) for Q3 trimmed mean prints to come in higher than Q2 and Q4 outcomes, and\n\n3) What looks like a number of one-off factors coming together in the quarter to push the trimmed mean higher.\n\n\"Indeed, if property rates & charges, tobacco and electricity prices had all risen 2.5% q/q in original terms and petrol prices hadn\u2019t changed, then trimmed mean would have printed about 0.14ppt lower.\n\n\"We focus on these items because they are either heavily influenced by government decisions or particularly volatile; but our broader point is that the trimmed mean inflation measure, like all data, can contain some noise alongside the underlying signal.\n\n\"We expect the RBA to express some concern about market sector services inflation next week, although the modest easing in the labour market over the past year does suggest a little downward pressure is still likely over the coming quarters.\n\n\"That\u2019s also consistent with what price and cost measures from business surveys point to on inflation more broadly.",

The Calile slid down the list to No.34 on the World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels rankings for 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best hotels for 2025 were announced at a ceremony at London\u2019s Old Billingsgate on Thursday, with luxury Chinese hotel Rosewood Hong Kong finally taking out the number one spot after featuring in the top three since the awards\u2019 inception in 2023. It marks the third edition of the annual hotel rankings for the 50 Best group, best-known for its annual global top-50 restaurants and bars lists. Compiled by UK-based company William Reed Business Media, the hotel rankings\u2019 debut in 2023 marked the group\u2019s first global launch since turning its attention to bars in 2009.

New South Wales and Queensland weren\u2019t the only Australian states to receive a 50 Best nod. Baillie Lodges\u2019 ultra-luxury all-inclusive retreat Southern Ocean Lodge on Kangaroo Island in South Australia was named the American Express Travel \u2018One To Watch\u2019 last month. Southern Ocean Lodge has been recognised in the World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels as the \u201cone to watch\u201d. The high-end retreat was rebuilt following the devastating 2020 bushfires that ravaged Kangaroo Island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe award marks a turning point for the property, which was destroyed in the January 2020 bushfires, and reopened a year ago following a long, painstaking clearing and rebuilding process.

The academy chair position for the Oceania region, which includes Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, is held by Melbourne-based food and travel critic Michael Harden, however it\u2019s not known how many of the jurors voting in the awards are Australian or Oceania-based.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels rankings is based on the votes of a collective of 580 jurors spanning nine geographical regions and comprising hoteliers, travel journalists, hotel educators and seasoned luxury travellers. Panel members submit seven votes, in order of preference, based on stays over a two-year period ending in April 2024. The World\u2019s 50 Best lists have been criticised for favouring European venues and demonstrating a lack of diversity, though measures have been taken to address some of these shortfalls, including mandating a 50/50 gender balance among jurors. Any hotel is eligible; there is no essential criterion for a property to qualify for a vote, and hotels aren\u2019t required to \u201cpay to play\u201d.

We will not stop, we will not relent, until we bring everyone home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Hamas released all living hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt committed to handing over the remains of all 28 hostages killed, in exchange for 360 Palestinian militants killed in the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Thursday, it had delivered 15 bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents of Brazil's capital Rio de Janeiro are outraged following a police operation in which at least 119 people were killed in the north of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nRio de Janeiro's governor Claudio Castro has defended the operation, which targeted the Comando Vermelho drug gang, saying authorities wanted to arrest suspects alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic defenders say the final body count of those killed in the favelas will rise to at least 132.\n\n\n\n\n\nJournalist and Rio de Janeiro resident Rosa Bittencourt has told SBS Portuguese the community needs to know who exactly was killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOf those 120 deaths, many were innocent people. Criminal or not, who are the people who died between yesterday and today? They\u2019re the ones living in the favela - black people, poor people, the marginalised, the wage earners. Yes, there were drug traffickers among the dead, but nothing that justifies an operation of this scale, which killed everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump says he has agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn exchange, China is set to resume buying US soybean, keep rare earths exports flowing, and crack down on the illicit trade of fentanyl.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan markes the end to the US leader's whirlwind diplomatic visit to Asia, where he also discussed trade deals with Korea, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting, their first since 2019, lasted nearly two hours and focused largely on trade tensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving South Korea, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he thought it was an \"amazing meeting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun says Mr Trump will visit China next year, and has invited Mr Xi to visit the US in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, President Xi Jinping emphasised that the trade delegations of both countries exchanged in-depth views on important trade and economic issues and reached a consensus on resolving them. Both delegations should refine and finalise the follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus that was reached.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nHurricane Melissa has torn through the northern Caribbean, causing widespread destruction and leaving thousands without power from Jamaica to Cuba and Haiti.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storm has gained speed as it moves across open waters towards Bermuda.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have confirmed 25 deaths in Haiti, including 10 children, and four fatalities in Jamaica since Melissa made landfall.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has since been downgraded from a Category Five to a Category Two storm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe devastated father of a teenage cricketer who died after a training accident has described his son as the shining light of their family.\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Austin died after being rushed to hospital in a critical condition on Tuesday, after he was struck in the neck by a ball at Ferntree Gully, in Melbourne's outer east.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Recently-tightened European Union sanctions on Russian oil could drive prices up and continue to shake global markets, experts say, which could lead to Australian drivers paying more for fuel and have a flow-on effect of increasing goods prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's inflation has risen again , up 1.3 per cent in the September quarter and 3.2 per cent over the year \u2014 the first increase in underlying inflation since late 2022, when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent global fuel prices soaring.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as in 2022, higher power and transport costs remain key drivers of inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, new data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) shows several sanctioned Russian \"shadow fleet\" tankers continue to appear in Australian-linked supply chains .\n\n\n\n\n\nCREA analyst Vaibhav Raghunandan told SBS Russian that while Australia's direct exposure to Russian oil is limited, the EU's \"net importer\" sanctions model could restrict supply and push prices higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Australia doesn't buy oil directly from Russia, global benchmarks move quickly \u2014 and those shifts often reach local pumps within weeks.\n\n\n\nRipple effects travel fast\n\nTony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia, said recent United States and EU sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil have already started reshaping trade flows in Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China's state oil companies have reportedly suspended seaborne purchases of Russian oil, and Indian refiners are reassessing their imports,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We may now be at a turning point, where higher oil prices could begin to flow through to Australian motorists over the next few weeks.\"\n\n\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark underpinning most imported fuel prices in the Asia-Pacific, climbed from lows nearing US$55 ($83) in September to about US$66 ($100) a barrel last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generally, a $1 change in crude translates to about a 1-cent change at the pump,\" Sycamore said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS Russian, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said retail fuel prices are \"largely determined by movements in international benchmark refined-fuel prices (which are driven by international crude-oil prices) and the AUD-USD exchange rate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in these benchmarks, the ACCC said, usually take about two weeks to filter through to major cities, and longer in regional areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOil prices often rise and fall in response to geopolitical flare-ups, and Sycamore said recent events have shown how quickly those swings can reverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Back in June, there were concerns that the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran would push oil above $100. It peaked around $78, then dropped again once that conflict ended.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not all shocks fade as fast. According to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, diesel prices in Australia hit record highs after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2014 surging above $2.20 a litre in late 2022, up from lows near $1.20 in 2020.\n\n\n\nPrices have stayed elevated since, hovering between the high $1.70s and low $2 range through 2023\u201324.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith recent sanctions and attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, analysts warn that volatility could intensify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The scope for Ukraine to ratchet up its attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, or stricter sanctions on Russian crude exports, could lead to a more significant market disruption and higher prices at the pump,\" said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at financial services firm MST Marquee.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiesel powers Australia's trucks, farms and railway freight, forming the backbone of transport, mining and agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen its price rises, it pushes up the cost of moving goods, growing food and running equipment, meaning consumers often feel it far beyond the pump.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also where global oil shocks are most sharply felt in Australia.\n\n\n\nAustralia's fuel dependence and limited storage\n\nAccording to the Australia Institute think tank, about 91 per cent of Australia's fuel consumption is met by imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat reliance is compounded by limited domestic storage. The Australian Financial Review reported this month, referring to government data, that Australia had oil stores equivalent to 49 days' worth of net imports, which is far below the 90-day requirement under the International Energy Agency treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) reported that in July, Australia held just 20 days of jet fuel, 24 days of diesel and 28 days of petrol.\n\n\n\nHow global prices flow to Australian pumps\n\nMost of Australia's refined fuel imports come from Singapore, South Korea and Japan, with smaller volumes from India and Malaysia, according to the DCCEEW statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, Australian fuel prices are largely driven by the Singapore benchmark \u2014 a daily regional price guide published by S&P Global Commodity Insights, also known as Platts. When oil prices, refinery costs, or shipping rates rise in Singapore, those increases flow directly through to Australian wholesalers and, within about two weeks, to drivers at the pump.\n\n\n\n\n\nS&P Global's Premasish Das says sanctions on Russian oil usually redirect trade rather than reduce it, but that rerouting drives up freight and insurance costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The EU sanctions on fuels produced from Russian oil could potentially displace more than 300,000 barrels a day of diesel shipments to the EU from India and Turkey,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This shift could fragment the diesel trade and clean-tanker [ships that carry refined fuel products] markets, making them more expensive. \u2026 Given Australia's reliance on imports, this will likely lead to increased fuel prices as well.\"\n\n\n\nRefiners and traders also use similar data from London-based firm Argus Media to monitor price trends across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nCara Wong, Asia-Pacific associate editor at Argus Media, said those shifts are already visible in Russia's export data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing more damage to Russian refining infrastructure, and loading data is already showing a drop in diesel exports,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although Australia doesn't buy directly from Russia, it affects the entire diesel market because it tightens supplies a little bit more \u2026 Further restrictions on fuels made from Russian crude would have an outsized impact on Singapore benchmarks.\"\n\n\n\nDisruptions to Russian oil refining\n\nBeyond sanctions, Russia's own refining sector has come under sustained attack. Ukrainian drone strikes have disabled a significant share of its capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy late September, more than 38 per cent of refining infrastructure was offline, according to analysts cited by news agencies Reuters and Lenta.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has since extended its fuel-export ban until the end of 2025 to stabilise domestic supplies.\n\n\n\nTatiana Mitrova, global fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told SBS Russian that the cumulative impact of these strikes is proving difficult to reverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Equipment shortages, sanctions on repairs and a new wave of attacks are prolonging Russia's recovery,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a result, export volumes are shrinking just as demand rises into the Northern Hemisphere winter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts say these disruptions add to the broader mix of geopolitical and market pressures already shaping global prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nSycamore said that, as well as sanctions on Russia, other global shifts are also feeding volatility; namely, US-trade tensions affecting global demand for crude oil.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent signs of progress in US\u2013China trade talks have lifted market confidence and pushed the Australian dollar higher against the US dollar, with some analysts predicting it could trade as high as 70 US cents.\n\n\n\nA stronger dollar can take some pressure off local fuel prices, Sycamore said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Importantly, OPEC has been increasing production \u2014 partly to offset the impact of Russian embargoes, but also to regain market share,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMitrova said the global market has so far proven resilient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the EU restricted imports, it narrowed Russia's export niche, mainly for diesel. But the global oil products market is highly flexible,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said these measures create logistical difficulties rather than a genuine shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finding new buyers, rearranging shipments, and processing transactions under sanctions takes time and money, but the trade continues,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar pattern occurred in 2022, when sanctions on Russian oil disrupted trade routes and raised freight and refining costs globally, contributing to Australian pump prices climbing above $2.20 a litre.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, wholesale diesel currently sits around $1.66\u2013$1.67 a litre, while average retail prices in Sydney are about $1.82 a litre, based on the latest NRMA data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Russian.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe historic overhaul of Australia's national environmental laws has been formally tabled in the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeader of the house Tony Burke introduced the 1500 page document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This package of bills is a once in a generation opportunity to reform our environmental laws. We've been down this path before under governments of both sides, and we cannot afford to wait any longer. This bill is a product of work over many years by countless people, all of whom I know are keen to see this done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seven-part bill has arrived five years after the 2020 Samuel Review found the current environmental laws were failing the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill is expected to pass through the House of Representatives by the end of next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government still needs to secure a deal with either the Greens or the Coalition to pass these environment reforms in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment minister Murray Watts has told the ABC that after 100 meetings with different stakeholders, when it comes to passing these bills it\u2019s \u2018now or never.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we ever want to pass these reforms, we've got to get moving with them. We can't let this go around in circles for five more years, because every time we wait and every time we get delayed, we see the environment suffer, and we see really important housing, renewables and other projects get held up in red tape.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe urgency is compounded by the Opposition, Greens, and crossbench teaming up to force the bill into a Senate inquiry that will not hand down its final report until March 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Watts says that at this stage of the debate, both the Coalition and the Greens are trying to extract final concessions from the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are saying it doesn't go far enough to protect the environment, Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young arguing it is riddled with concessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From what we have seen, this is weakening environmental protection and doing the bidding of big business, paving the way for new coal and gas to be fast tracked, paving the way for big developers and big business to make it easier and cheaper for them to get environmental approval. Meanwhile, no protection for our native forests and no protection for the climate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition is worried the bill doesn't do enough for business.\n\n\n\n\n\nA core component of the government's reform is the establishment of a National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), but Opposition environment spokesperson Angie Bell has voiced concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Bell says the inclusion of emissions reporting in the EPBC Act could open the door to increased legal challenges - but she is most crtical of what she calls the \"EPA's sweeping powers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The wide ranging powers of the EPA, it'll be a statutory appointment that will not report directly to the minister. The minister won't be able to sack that individual. It'll have to be be the governor general that does that. And so that that is a problem in terms of what that outcome might look like in terms of broad, sweeping powers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental groups, however, are expressing the opposite concern about the E-P-A.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups like the Australian Conversation Foundation are worried that retaining the Minister's power of final approval over the EPA will leave environmental protection vulnerable to the political whims of whoever is currently in power.\n\n\n\n\n\nActing CEO of the A-C-F, Paul Sinclair, spoke to SBS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things that we would love would be for it to be genuinely independent, where the CEO of the EPA would make approval decisions rather than the minister. That would mean that the minister could be the champion of the environment, rather than having to approve, as he's done recently, one of the largest gas polluting gas projects in the southern hemisphere. So we would like to see those approval decisions at a at arm's length from the minister, so that they can't a future Minister can't be influenced by industry, and we think it's a better decision making process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the other major concerns expressed by environmental groups is around native forest logging.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray Watt has told the ABC that the agricultural land clearing exemptions sought by environmental groups hadn't been addressed because some of those issues were not included in the Samuel Review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As we've said since my predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, began work on this package, is that we would apply the national environmental standards to regional forestry agreements under which native forestry occurs. That was the recommendation from Graham Samuel. So that's the direction we're intending to go. I am aware that some of the environment groups are also seeking removal of exemptions when it comes to agricultural land clearing. There's not anything in the bill on that front, mainly because my priority has been to focus on delivering those recommendations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Paul Sinclair says the government is ignoring elements of the Samuel Review that are related to native forest logging.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Samuel Review explicitly labelled the Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) as 'broken', and he argues the federal government must take over their management from the states to secure these protections through enforceable national standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Sinclair has told SBS these issues haven't been addressed in the current bill.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australians could miss out on more than $130,000 in retirement because of the \"daunting complexity\" of the superannuation system, according to a new report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report by industry peak body the Super Members Council (SMC) calls for reform to simplify the system and make financial guidance more accessible as Australia faces what it has called a \"silver tsunami\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wave of retirement over the next decade will see 2.8 million Australians leave the workforce, according to the SMC, which predicts a doubling of the annual number of retirees from 150,000 to 300,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt estimates that over this same period, the collective amount these retirees will have in super will double from about $750-800 billion to about $1.5 trillion over that same period.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it also predicts that a typical retiree could miss out on as much as $136,000 \u2014 or $6,500 a year \u2014 over the course of retirement unless changes are made.\n\n\n\nThe report cautions that \"without new solutions, our current retirement system will continue to impose too much complexity on retirees, which is overwhelming for all but the most financially confident\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSMC chief executive Misha Schubert said the findings highlight \"with fresh urgency\" the need for a simpler, more intuitive retirement system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to make the shift into retirement so much simpler, easier and more intuitive for everyday Australians,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This challenge is now incredibly urgent as almost three million Australians start to race towards retirement in coming years.\"\n\n\n\nRetiring 'with confidence'\n\nThe report also points to rising challenges as Australians live longer and retire with higher levels of debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 40 per cent of households approaching retirement now have a mortgage, while many struggle to navigate how super interacts with the age pension.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite strong demand for assistance, few retirees seek professional advice. More than 80 per cent of pre-retirees said they would use free financial guidance from their super fund, but only half would pay for detailed advice.\n\n\n\nProposed reforms include automatically removing tax from eligible accounts at age 65, reviewing minimum drawdown rules for low-balance retirees, and introducing quality standards for retirement products.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also claims to dispel the \"persistent myth\" that retirees underspend their super.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2024\u201325 financial year, 64 per cent of retirees with tax-free accounts withdrew more than the minimum required, rising to 78 per cent among those with balances below $50,000, according to the SMC report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Moving to a system of simpler, smarter pathways into retirement would mean every Australian could retire with confidence, knowing they're not missing out on money to pay the bills and enjoy their later years,\" Schubert said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia estimates that the lump sum needed at retirement to support a comfortable lifestyle is $690,000 for a couple and $595,000 for a single person, according to data from the March quarter 2025. This assumes home ownership and a partial age pension.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Treasurer Jim Chalmers has confirmed that a new round of consultation on the superannuation performance test \u2014 a regulatory assessment \u2014 is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The goal is to refine and strengthen the performance test to make sure it isn\u2019t creating unnecessary obstacles to investment, particularly in key areas like housing and energy,\" he said at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry gala dinner in Canberra on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about better aligning and unlocking investment that also boosts productivity, while maintaining a robust test and a primary focus on member returns.\"\n\n\n\n$19 billion in lost super\n\nThe new report comes after the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) revealed on Wednesday there is almost $19 billion in lost and unclaimed superannuation waiting to be reunited with more than 7 million people.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The changes to your superannuation in Treasurer Jim Chalmers' surprise announcement\n\nATO deputy commissioner Ben Kelly said lost or unclaimed super can occur when accounts become inactive and funds lose contact with their members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Checking for lost or unclaimed super is like reaching into your pocket and finding a $50 note \u2014 it's your money, you just didn\u2019t know it was there,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ATO estimates that around four million Australians hold two or more super accounts, increasing the risk of duplicated fees and lost balances.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average amount of lost or unclaimed super is $2,590, which could grow to tens of thousands by retirement if left unclaimed, according to the ATO.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is general information.

The Calile slid down the list to No.34 on the World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels rankings for 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best hotels for 2025 were announced at a ceremony at London\u2019s Old Billingsgate on Thursday, with luxury Chinese hotel Rosewood Hong Kong finally taking out the number one spot after featuring in the top three since the awards\u2019 inception in 2023. It marks the third edition of the annual hotel rankings for the 50 Best group, best-known for its annual global top-50 restaurants and bars lists. Compiled by UK-based company William Reed Business Media, the hotel rankings\u2019 debut in 2023 marked the group\u2019s first global launch since turning its attention to bars in 2009.

New South Wales and Queensland weren\u2019t the only Australian states to receive a 50 Best nod. Baillie Lodges\u2019 ultra-luxury all-inclusive retreat Southern Ocean Lodge on Kangaroo Island in South Australia was named the American Express Travel \u2018One To Watch\u2019 last month. Southern Ocean Lodge has been recognised in the World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels as the \u201cone to watch\u201d. The high-end retreat was rebuilt following the devastating 2020 bushfires that ravaged Kangaroo Island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe award marks a turning point for the property, which was destroyed in the January 2020 bushfires, and reopened a year ago following a long, painstaking clearing and rebuilding process.

The academy chair position for the Oceania region, which includes Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, is held by Melbourne-based food and travel critic Michael Harden, however it\u2019s not known how many of the jurors voting in the awards are Australian or Oceania-based.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels rankings is based on the votes of a collective of 580 jurors spanning nine geographical regions and comprising hoteliers, travel journalists, hotel educators and seasoned luxury travellers. Panel members submit seven votes, in order of preference, based on stays over a two-year period ending in April 2024. The World\u2019s 50 Best lists have been criticised for favouring European venues and demonstrating a lack of diversity, though measures have been taken to address some of these shortfalls, including mandating a 50/50 gender balance among jurors. Any hotel is eligible; there is no essential criterion for a property to qualify for a vote, and hotels aren\u2019t required to \u201cpay to play\u201d.

    "text": "Tom Decent Usman Khawaja\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\n\nSteve Smith\n\nCameron Green\n\nTravis Head\n\nBeau Webster Usman Khawaja\u2019s big-game experience remains invaluable. The 38-year-old deserves the first two Tests at the top, but if he doesn\u2019t make a significant score, a farewell at the Gabba looms. That is unless Australia record big wins in Perth and Brisbane. Khawaja peeled off 232 against Sri Lanka earlier this year, yet he has passed 90 just once in 44 Test innings since June 2023.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\u2019s runs for Queensland are encouraging, and facing the new ball won\u2019t bother him. Green is well-suited to No.4 and is likely to make that spot his for a decade once Smith retires, so why not start now? Steve Smith reached triple figures for NSW this week. Credit: Getty Images It would also give Green a bit more of a breather if he\u2019s bowling. Beau Webster stays in the team as insurance given there are questions over Green\u2019s potential bowling loads. From seven Tests, Webster has done everything asked of him, averaging 34.63 with the bat. Mitch Marsh could be a smoky to open the batting but Labuschagne is firming to go up the top, with Green, Smith, Head, and Webster to follow.\n\nChloe Saltau Usman Khawaja\n\nMatt Renshaw\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\n\nSteve Smith\n\nTravis Head\n\nBeau Webster As doubts persist about Cameron Green\u2019s capacity to bowl a meaningful number of overs, I\u2019m leaving him out of the XI. It\u2019s a tough call. Effectively, I\u2019m picking a specialist opener in Renshaw ahead of him, and rewarding Labuschagne for doing exactly what was asked of him \u2013 going back to the Shield and scoring a mountain of runs. Beau Webster has done nothing wrong since coming in as an all-rounder \u2013 his bowling adds versatility and balance, and his big mitts are an asset in the field. Jon Pierik\n\nUsman Khawaja\n\nJake Weatherald\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\n\nSteve Smith\n\nTravis Head\n\nCameron Green Usman Khawaja is a lock to retain his spot at the top of the order, but who should be his partner has been a major debate. I am plumping for Tasmanian Jake Weatherald, last season\u2019s leading Sheffield Shield run scorer, who has scores of 67, 57, and 94 among his innings so far this season. His time has arrived. Sam Konstas has not done enough to justify a return. Marnus Labuschagne has done what the selectors asked and lifted his scoring rate since he was axed from the Test team. He is ready to return in his customary role at No.3. I have Cameron Green at No.6. If he can deliver eight to 10 quality overs a day, it\u2019s best if the all-rounder is given the chance to rest early when Australia are batting.\n\nDan Walsh Usman Khawaja\n\nMatt Renshaw\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\n\nSteve Smith\n\nTravis Head\n\nBeau Webster If Cameron Green isn\u2019t bowling, and there\u2019s a lot of faith required to see him adding to the four overs he managed before succumbing to side \u2018soreness\u2019 earlier this month, then Beau Webster deserves the all-rounder\u2019s gig. He\u2019s been a sure, steady hand with bat, ball, and in the field in much the same vein as a fully fit Green since his Test debut. Pat Cummins\u2019 potential return offers a chance to recalibrate the fifth bowling option according to how Australia\u2019s pacemen are holding up. But for the first two Tests, there\u2019s just too much upheaval at the top already for Marnus Labuschagne to be shoehorned into opening, so Green can fit in at No.3 as well. Renshaw returns as a far more rounded opener than the \u2018turtle\u2019 he first answered to during his first stint in the Test side. Consistent runs for Queensland, Australia A, and a recent ODI debut complement recent county stints in England where he\u2019s added scoring shots around the wicket, and get him the nod ahead of the impressive Jake Weatherald.",
