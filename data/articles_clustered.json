    "text": "A popular Alaskan climber has fallen to his death from Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, marking the third death in the US park this summer.\n\nBalin Miller, 23, died in a climbing accident on Wednesday, his mother Jeanine Girard-Moorman confirmed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been climbing since he was a young boy,\u201d she said.\n\nBalin Miller sits atop Mount Hunter on May 14, 2025 after summiting via the French Connection route solo. (Balin Miller)\n\n\u201cHis heart and soul was truly to just climb.\n\n\u201cHe loved to climb and it was never about money and fame.\u201d\n\nThe death comes on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which left national parks \u201cgenerally\u201d open, with limited operations and closed visitors centers, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe park service did not respond to an email requesting comment, and it's unclear what staff remains at Yosemite during the shutdown.\n\nEl Capitan is one of the most striking features of Yosemite National Park, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 915 metres that entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.\n\nAlex Honnold completed the first free solo climb of El Capitan in 2017 for the documentary Free Solo .\n\nThe famed El Capitan rock face. (Adobe Stock)\n\nMany posted tributes to Miller on social media, saying they had watched him climb on a TikTok livestream for two days before his death and referring him to \u201corange tent guy\" because of his distinctive camp setup.\n\nEarlier this year, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while free-soloing, or climbing without a rope, on a different formation. In August, a 29-year-old woman died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch while hiking.\n\nWhile it's still unclear exactly what happened, his older brother, Dylan Miller, said Balin was lead rope soloing \u2014 a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope \u2014 on a 730-metre route named Sea of Dreams.\n\nHe had already finished the climb and was hauling up his last bit of gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Dylan said.\n\nMiller was an accomplished alpinist who had already gained international attention for claiming the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, a technically difficult route that took him 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June.\n\nHe grew up climbing in Alaska with his brother and their father, who was also a climber.\n\nWhile Dylan took a little more time to fall in love with the sport, it stuck with his younger sibling instantly.\n\n\u201cHe said he felt most alive when he was climbing,\u201d Dylan Miller said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m his bigger brother but he was my mentor.\u201d\n\nThis year, Balin Miller had also spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies, ticking off a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine.\n\n\"He\u2019s had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone that I can think of,\u201d Clint Helander, an Alaska alpinist, told the Anchorage Daily News .\n\nBut this most recent trip to Yosemite wasn't supposed to be hard climbing.\n\nMiller had just arrived two weeks early to climb and enjoy the park's beauty and solitude before the rest of his family, who planned to meet up there.\n\nMore than just a climber, he loved animals and was fun, kind and full of life, his mother said.\n\nHe often climbed with a stripe of glitter freckles across his cheekbones, describing it in a Climbing magazine interview like \u201ca warrior putting makeup on before going into battle\u201d.",

    "text": "Hidden beneath the turquoise waters off a stretch of Florida known as the \u201cTreasure Coast,\u201d a team of divers from a shipwreck salvage company have uncovered exactly that \u2014 a load of long-lost Spanish treasure they estimate is worth US$1 million (A$1.5 million).\n\nMore than 1,000 silver and gold coins thought to be minted in the Spanish colonies of Bolivia, Mexico and Peru were uncovered this summer off Florida's Atlantic coast, 1715 Fleet \u2013 Queens Jewels LLC announced this week.\n\nIt's not the first time the site has yielded a trove of, well, treasure.\n\nIn this undated photo provided by shipwreck salvage company 1715 Fleet- Queens Jewels, LLC, diver Levin Shavers shows coins uncovered from a Spanish shipwreck off the Atlantic coast of Florida. (LLC via AP)\n\nCenturies ago, a fleet of Spanish ships laden with gold, silver and jewels taken from the New World was sailing back to Spain when a hurricane wrecked the flotilla on July 31, 1715, spilling the treasures into the sea, according to the 1715 Fleet Society.\n\nOver the years, millions of dollars in gold coins from the 1715 Fleet have been found by salvagers and treasure hunters in a coastal area stretching from Melbourne to Fort Pierce.\n\nDates and mint marks are still visible on some of the recently recovered coins, the salvage company said, a benefit for historians and collectors hoping to glean more from the lost treasure.\n\n\u201cThis discovery is not only about the treasure itself, but the stories it tells,\u201d Sal Guttuso, director of operations for the salvage company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEach coin is a piece of history, a tangible link to the people who lived, worked, and sailed during the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire. Finding 1,000 of them in a single recovery is both rare and extraordinary.\u201d\n\nGuttuso's team employs dive crews and a fleet of boats and uses underwater metal detection-devices, plus hand-fanning of sand or sand suction to comb the sea floor, according to a public notice for a federal permit application the company filed.\n\nLast year, Florida officials announced they had recovered dozens of gold coins stolen by salvagers from the wreck. The suspect was identified as a family member of the team contracted by 1715 Fleet \u2013 Queens Jewels LLC to work the site.\n\nDivers find 100 bottles of 'royal' champagne on shipwreck View Gallery\n\nUnder Florida law, any \u201ctreasure trove\u201d or other historic artifacts \u201cabandoned\u201d on state-owned lands or in state waters belong to the state, though excavators can be permitted to carry out \u201crecovery services.\u201d\n\nThe law requires that roughly 20 percent of the recovered archaeological materials be retained by the state for research collections or public display.\n\nGuttuso told The Associated Press his team develops a detailed inventory of all the artifacts collected each season to be reviewed by the state.\n\nFlorida officials select up to 20 percent of the items to keep for the public, in a negotiation process that is ultimately approved by a federal court. Remaining artifacts are split equally among the salvage company's owners and its subcontractors, Guttuso said.\n\n\"We want to do it right,\" Guttuso said.\n\n\u201cAnd it benefits the people of Florida. They end up in the museums,\u201d he said of the treasures.",

(Daniel Pockett/AFL Photos/via Getty Images)\n\nWhile the Lions are on the cusp of a dynasty, the city's biggest NRL side, the Brisbane Broncos, have just ended one itself.\n\nIn front of a sold-out Lang Park, the Broncos clawed back a 14-0 deficit at half-time to defeat the Penrith Panthers, who had won the last four NRL premierships, and qualify for a second grand final in three years.\n\nTheir NRLW side has also made the grand final and is the most successful team with three titles to its name.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Popular WA car enthusiast killed in horror crash\n\nKotoni Staggs and Deine Mariner of the Broncos celebrate victory over the Penrith Panthers on Sunday.

(Getty)\n\nAnd it's only set to get bigger as the city gears up to host the 2032 Olympics, joining Melbourne and Sydney as host cities for the biggest sporting event in the world.\n\nWith this comes huge upgrades for its stadiums, with Queensland Premier David Crisafulli pledging to upgrade the iconic Lang Park ahead of the games.\n\nA brand new Olympic Stadium seating 63,000 is proposed for Victoria Park, whilst a huge Aquatic Centre seating 25,000 will also be built in the area.\n\nThis will give the city facilities that rival those seen in Melbourne.\n\nSchrinner claims Brisbane has now staked its claim as the sporting capital of a sports-mad country, and he claims it will only get bigger as the Olympics approach.\n\n\"Brisbane has cemented its place as Australia's sporting capital,\" he said.\n\n\"With the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games on the horizon, we're gearing up to make it even bigger and better.\"\n\nIt's a bold claim to make given Melbourne's sporting heritage, but the evidence suggests it may not be a far-fetched idea.\ufeff",

It's just a cat.'\"\n\nVets and counsellors say there are a few steps pet owners can take to prepare for and address the complicated grief that comes with choosing to say goodbye to a pet.\n\nPets provide unconditional love\n\nVanessa Rohlf is clinical counsellor in Naarm/Melbourne who specialises in animal bereavement and pet loss\n\n\"Companion animals are really special in that they provide unconditional love, and they really provide a space where we can truly be ourselves.\"\n\nDr Rohlf says pets also \"ease loneliness\" and \"provide stability\".\n\n\"Even just gazing into the eyes of our dog can release that cuddle hormone called oxytocin\" and \"patting a pet is linked with an increase in the 'feel-good hormones' of dopamine and serotonin,\" she says.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nMs Koenig says a pet is also often \"the first time we've ever really cared for something outside of ourselves\".\n\nShe says our pets share some of the most ordinary and intimate parts of the day with us and it's going to be hard when they are suddenly no longer there.\n\n\"They slept in your bed, walked with you to the bathroom, watched you while you had a shower and ate your breakfast with you.\"\n\nHow pet euthanasia works\n\nJackie Campbell is a vet who specialises in palliative care. She says palliative care is something more pet owners and families are looking for \"as our pets are becoming more and more important to us\".\n\nBased on the Sunshine Coast on the traditional lands of the Kabi Kabi and Jinibara People, Dr Campbell says advances in veterinary medicine is also resulting in aging pets with more options.\n\n\"Owners are then faced with more complex decisions and more emotional decisions than the generation before.\"The chief veterinary officer at the Lort Smith animal hospital in Naarm/Melbourne, Jessica Wilde says euthanasia is a \"really difficult experience for pet owners, especially if it's the first time\".\n\nJackie Campbell is a veterinarian at Sunset Vets, a palliative care and home euthanasia service. (Supplied: Jackie Campbell)\n\nDr Wilde says during a typical procedure, a catheter would be used to gain intravenous access (often placed in a pet's leg).\n\nThe next step is often a \"light sedation\", helping them to \"feel nice and calm during the procedure\".\n\nIt can take 10 to 20 minutes for that to come into effect, Dr Wilde says, \"which gives owners a really good time to sit with their pet\".\n\nShe says the catheter is then used to administer the anaesthetic, which is \"injected into the pet's veins directly and stops the heart very quickly\".\n\nThere are also often twitches or some movements in those final moments, and she makes sure owners know beforehand that \"they're not a sign your pet's struggling or feeling any discomfort\".\n\nDr Wilde says some clinics have dedicated rooms to help things feel less clinical. There are also at-home pet euthanasia options.\n\nDr Campbell says the procedure can vary between clinics and veterinarians, and in some cases a pet may be sedated beforehand.\n\nKnowing the right time\n\nDr Wilde says euthanasia is typically considered as a \"treatment option\" after a pet has aged and developed chronic conditions.\n\nKnowing when to put down your dog Photo shows Illustration of shadow of man and his dog walking away representing the experience of putting down a pet dog. Deciding to put down your best mate is never easy. Here are helpful considerations that can provide guidance.\n\n\"We're normally working with those [owners], seeing them probably more regularly at that point and talking to them about the quality of life of the pet.\"\n\nDr Campbell says, \"the most important thing is that we don't make that decision too early [and] equally that we don't make that decision too late\".\n\nShe says there is lots of nuance involved and while quality of life assessment tools help, it's \"best done in collaboration with the vet, who understands what's happening for you and for your pet\".\n\nDr Campbell says pet owners often experience intense anticipatory grief when a pet is coming to the end of its life.\n\n\"That could be for a year or two, six months, depending on that's happening.\"\n\nDr Wilde says the harder decisions are sometimes those made necessary by an unexpected incident, such as a pet that has collapsed, been hit by a car or experiencing some other trauma.\n\nThis is when vets and owners would discuss the extent of the injuries or disease and whether treatment options are in the pets' best interests, she says.\n\nDisenfranchised grief\n\nDr Rohlf says losing a pet can come with disenfranchised grief, which is \"a loss that isn't typically acknowledged by society\".\n\nWhile people are getting better at recognising the significance of pets, phrases like \"it's just a dog\" or \"when are you going to get another?\" can come with good intentions but don't acknowledge how painful the loss can be.\n\nVanessa Rohlf is a clinical counsellor and research fellow at La Trobe University. (Supplied: Vanessa Rohlf )\n\nMs Koenig agrees that our culture doesn't see the death of a pet \"as a real reason to grieve\".\n\n\"People think that you're not supposed to be this sad about a dog or a cat.\"\n\nShe says people often struggle with coming home to a house without their pet and going to sleep and waking up.\n\nCrying in the pet food aisle of the supermarket is also something she has heard a lot.\n\nDr Rohlf says for some clients, the intensity of grief and the loss of meaning and purpose really catches them by surprise.\n\nStruggling with a pet's death\n\nDr Rohlf says it is important to validate your grief.\n\n\"Grief is a really natural and normal response to losing a loved one.\n\nWatch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.\n\n\"If we think of grief a little bit like a wound which requires some care and attention but will heal over time, I think that can be really helpful.\"\n\nSecondly, she says \"seeking meaning\" can also help.\n\nWhen you're ready, she recommends reflecting on the ways you made their life a good one, how they enriched your life and what they taught you.\n\nThirdly, Dr Rohlf says seeking support by speaking to people who \"get it\" can be helpful. This might include understanding friends and family or a qualified therapist.\n\nMs Koenig says both Griefline and Lifeline are free services you can use if you don't have anyone to talk to.\n\nShe recommends people keep themselves safe and that the loss of a pet in any context can be \"a real reason to feel real deep grief\".",

(City of Melbourne)\n\nThe maps of Yarra and Darebin are the first to use the rating system, and come as part of a two-year rollout of updated flood mapping across Greater Melbourne, with 60 new maps across 38 council areas to be updated.\n\n\"This is about protecting lives and property where the risk is greatest, while making it easier to build homes and businesses in low-risk places,\" Minister for Water Gayle Tierney said.\n\nLocal council blasts lack of solutions from government\n\nCity of Yarra Mayor Stephen Jolly said he was called into a meeting with Melbourne Water two days ago, where he was blindsided by the new mapping.\n\n\"I can tell you there's people right throughout Yarra choking on their croissants this morning,\" Cr Jolly told ABC Melbourne radio.\n\n\"Twenty-one thousand homes in Yarra, 38,000 homes in Darebin, just to our north, who have now got this flood overlay potentially on their homes.\"\n\nThe mapping shows possible heavy flooding in the north of Fitzroy near Alexandra Parade.\n\nCr Jolly criticised Melbourne Water for identifying an issue with the city's drainage but not formulating a solution.\n\n\"It's not their fault the stormwater drains are not up to scratch; they're 100 years old, but let's see a plan to fix them,\" he said.\n\n\"There was zero dollars put on the table two days ago when we met with Melbourne Water to say, 'This is a problem, this asset, we're gonna fix it.'\"\n\nCr Jolly said the council had invested $4 million in fixing its own stormwater drains, but saw no commitment from the government to do the same.\n\n\"It's a lot cheaper for them just to handball it to the locals,\" Cr Jolly said.\n\n\"It'll be devastating for locals, in terms of their insurance costs, in terms of property values and also for development.\"\n\nResidents feel 'let down' by government\n\nMichael Spencer, adjunct fellow at Monash Business School teaching sustainability regulation, said the new mapping showing the vulnerability of Melbourne's stormwater system was \"a long time coming\".\n\n\"We haven't really evaluated the flood capacity of our stormwater systems. We're now starting to do that because all around the world we're seeing these systems being overwhelmed by extreme events,\" Dr Spencer said.\n\nHe said it was often more \"convenient\" for governments to shift the responsibility to other areas.\n\nMichael Spencer says the brunt of the costs from increased flood risk will be borne by residents and businesses. ( ABC News: Scott Jewell )\n\n\"We see it all around the world, because of the financial situation of our state government, I suspect we're right at the forefront,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of the approach so far has been to move the issue into the planning system.\n\n\" Essentially, it moves it onto the private home owners, who have a reasonable expectation that council will provide a stormwater system that's fit for purpose. \"\n\nHe said the insurance industry was lobbying hard for further investment into the system from government, with premiums expected to rise to reflect the increased risk.\n\nDr Spencer is also chair of the Fitzroy Residents' Association, and said locals are hoping for a stronger response from government.\n\n\"I think residents are going to feel let down, because on the one hand they want to know the risks, but they also want to know 'how we're going to deal with it?'\" he said.\n\n\"It's not just the individual resident or the individual businesses' problem, it's a collective problem and we've all got to work together to solve it and we need leadership in that, and it's not coming at the moment.\"",

(Supplied: Stu Ross/Milk Video)\n\n\"All the things that could be done with textiles, if only we were given the chance rather than constantly asked to do the cheapest, fastest thing,\" project lead Meriel Chamberlin said.\n\nLooking to tackle some of the biggest issues in the clothing supply chain, the Queensland-based textile scientist wanted to create a sustainable fabric that could be made from start to finish in Australia.\n\n\"The idea was: What would it look like if we could combine the natural properties of wool and cotton to create some fabrics that could be super low [environmental] impact?\" she said.\n\n\" It was looking to take out as many processes as possible and still create something lovely. \"\n\nThe wool fibre is dyed before spinning. (Supplied: Stu Ross/Milk Video)\n\nThe result is both a knitted and woven fabric they hope will challenge how Australians think about clothing.\n\nThe experiment\n\nThe UN estimates global textile production doubled between 2000 and 2015.\n\nMore than half of that is synthetic and each year the industry produces 92 million tonnes of waste.\n\nUsing a grant from the Country Road Climate Fund, Ms Chamberlin called on the expertise of Chris Hurren, from Deakin University's Institute for Frontier Materials, and weaving mill and dye house Loomtex.\n\nMeriel Chamberlin (left), Chris Hurren and Samantha Van Zyl. (Supplied: Deakin University )\n\nDr Hurren said they wanted to use the natural cotton and wool already produced in Australia, but there was a shortcoming.\n\n\"Traditionally they're not blended together because cotton [fibre] has a length around the 30 millimetre mark, and wool is generally around the 70mm mark,\" he said.\n\nWool and cotton aren't usually blended into fabric because the fibres are different lengths and they're hard to dye together. (Supplied: Eqwools)\n\nTo make a fabric, fibres of similar length are spun together to create yarn or thread, which is then knitted or woven.\n\nBut if the fibres are different lengths, the process is more complex, often making the end product more expensive.\n\nTo overcome that challenge, the team used fleece too short for a traditional wool spinning mill.\n\n\"Wool that would normally come off the bellies, the crutches and the legs \u2014 the little bits around the edge of a fleece,\" Dr Hurren said.\n\nThe shorter wool can be spun in a cotton spinning system, but he said it was almost impossible to dye them together because plant-based and animal-based fabrics require different techniques.\n\nDifferent lengths of wool and cotton fibres. (Supplied: Eqwools)\n\nDr Hurren said the team decided to dye the wool only before blending the two fibres, which created a colour effect known as a marle \u2014 hence, Mud to Marle.\n\n\"About 60 per cent of the energy that goes into making a textile goes into colouring,\" Dr Hurren said.\n\n\"We only dyed 30 per cent of the fibre, which meant that we only used 30 per cent of the energy that went into the dyeing process and 30 per cent of the chemicals and water and so forth.\n\n\"That had a big offset on the environmental impact of the textile.\"\n\nThe yarn is spun at Deakin University, then woven and knitted into fabric at Loomtex. (Supplied: Stu Ross/Milk Video)\n\nThe wool was taken to Loomtex in Geelong, Victoria, to be dyed.\n\nLoomtex chief executive Samantha Van Zyl said they chose dyes certified as sustainable and mapped the carbon emissions.\n\n\"I found that the different colours that we used for the project \u2014 lighter versus darker, yellow versus blue \u2014 had quite significant emission changes,\" Ms Van Zyl said.\n\nThe shorter wool fibres are spun in seven different countries. (Supplied: Eqwools )\n\nIt was then sent back to Deakin University to be spun before returning to Loomtex to be knitted and woven for hoodies, dresses, T-shirts and even a denim.\n\n\"The knit's got quite a bit of stretch to it, but it will keep you warm and also offer breathability to keep you cool as well,\" Ms Van Zyl said.\n\n\" [The denim] was quite soft. It's really luxurious, actually. It's quite a nice fabric. \"\n\nThe next challenge\n\nThe cotton was sourced from Queensland and the wool was supplied by Michell Wool in South Australia.\n\nEqwools was created by South Australian company Michell Wool. (Supplied: Eqwools)\n\nThe company had already worked with Deakin University on their own fibre innovation project \u2014 Eqwools \u2014 which also uses short wool in the cotton spinning system.\n\nGeneral manager Gaynor Scott said they had been producing commercially for a year.\n\n\"We are now spinning our wool fibre \u2026 in seven countries and 24 cotton spinners across the world,\" she said.\n\nWool and cotton spinning is the only step of textile manufacturing not available in Australia (Supplied: Eqwools)\n\nCurrently, all cotton and wool spinning is done offshore in countries including China, Vietnam and Bangladesh.\n\nBut Ms Chamberlain said the Mud to Marle team hoped to fully manufacture garments in Australia.\n\n\"We're only missing one stage to be able to make things fully onshore in textiles \u2014 that's spinning,\" Ms Chamberlain said.\n\nShe said other parts of the supply chain \u2014 like wool scouring, cotton ginning and textile and garment manufacturing \u2014 were still done in Australia, though at a smaller scale.\n\n\"Lots of people think there's nothing here, but actually there still is but it's use it or lose it. It's like a muscle,\" Ms Chamberlain said.\n\nThe Australian Fashion Council said that after decades of decline, the textile manufacturing sector was at a critical tipping point, although there were signs of stabilisation.\n\nIt is due to deliver a national manufacturing strategy to bring the textile industry home later this year.",

    "text": "Usman Khawaja is set to begin his red-ball campaign ahead of the Ashes with no concern over when \"the end\" of his Test career will come.\n\nThe 38-year-old will play for Queensland in the opening Sheffield Shield round against Tasmania at Allan Border Field on Saturday, seeking runs, but is regarded as a lock to play in the first Test against England in Perth that starts on November 21.\n\nKhawaja, who has scored more Test runs (3,166 at 47.25) than any other Australian batsman beyond the age of 35, spoke about why he has rejected the concept of a farewell tour or predicting his Test future.\n\n\"That is the only reason, I can confidently say, I have performed the way I have since I have come back into the team,\" he said.\n\n\"It is due to my perspective, my beliefs, and the understanding everything is meant to be the way it is meant to be.\"\n\nKhawaja's opening partner for the first Test in Perth is still to be determined. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nThe last Ashes series in Australia in 2021-22 was a sliding-doors moment.\n\nKhawaja was recalled after a two and a half year absence from the Test team and struck 137 and 101 not out in the fourth Test in Sydney. From that moment, he has been a regular at the top of the order.\n\n\"Before I came back into the team, I had lost everything in terms of cricket,\" Khawaja said.\n\nPlayers to watch this Sheffield Shield season Photo shows Teammates surround a smiling Scott Boland and ruffle his hair after he completes a Test hat-trick. With Australia's men's Test team largely settled, there are a few key spots that could hang on a handful of Sheffield Shield performances before the start of the Ashes.\n\n\"I had lost my (Cricket) Australia contract. I wasn't playing one-day cricket, T20 cricket or Test cricket for Australia \u2026 but life was pretty good, so I know that when cricket is over, life will still be good.\n\n\"I only had one daughter then, Aisha. I had a lot of fun with her and was doing other stuff. I am a simple man in many respects. I like simple things, so when I came back into the team that summer for Australia, my perspective on life was totally different.\"\n\nKhawaja said his personal belief system and Islamic faith meant he was at peace with the concept of \"the end\", both in cricket and life.\n\n\"I know that, just like cricket, we are not going to live forever,\" he said.\n\n\"I could literally walk out of this room and die this afternoon. I could die tomorrow. I have a really close relationship with death, even though that seems weird to people.\n\n\"I think it is a part of Islam in general, knowing that everything that has a beginning also has an end. At one stage, we are all going to go. That is very important to me and has always kept me very level-headed, particularly later on in life as I have matured.\"\n\nIf Khawaja makes it to the third Test in Adelaide, he will be 39. The late Bob Simpson was the last Test batsman to play for Australia beyond the age of 39 after he came out of retirement during World Series Cricket in 1977 as a 41-year-old.\n\nUsman Khawaja will begin his summer with Queensland in the Sheffield Shield. (Getty Images: Steve Bell)\n\n\"If you told me four years ago I'd be playing cricket for Australia at the age of 38, and potentially 39 this December, I would have laughed at you,\" Khawaja grinned.\n\n\"I feel blessed. I was (ICC) world Test player of the year (in 2023). When you look at some of the names that have won it like (Kumar) Sangakkara, (Ricky) Ponting, (Jacques) Kallis \u2026 the greats of the game \u2026 to have achieved that at 36 was special.\n\n\"I've scored a lot of runs and got to play a lot of cricket at the back-end of my career that I never thought I would.\"\n\nThe opening round of the Shield will showcase competition for batting spots at the top of the order to partner Khawaja in the opening Ashes Test, with NSW's Sam Konstas seeking runs against Western Australia in Perth.\n\nVictoria opener Marcus Harris is also eyeing a recall, and a big score will help his cause when his side plays South Australia in Adelaide.\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: EnergyCo)\n\nOnce operating, the REZ is expected to provide an extra 8,000 megawatts of electricity to the market.\n\nGrazier Bruce Rutherford was planning to sell his property before EnergyCo changed the corridor.\n\nHe said valuers estimated his land could lose up to 50 per cent of its worth if the transmission lines went ahead.\n\nBruce Rutherford says valuers have told him the transmission lines could greatly affect his property's value. (Supplied: Bruce Rutherford)\n\n\"The land up here makes anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000 an acre [0.4 hectares],\" he said.\n\n\"It's uncertainty that could go on for another four or five years.\"\n\nGrazier Anna Young and her husband bought their property, just outside of Walcha, in May.\n\nShe said there was no indication EnergyCo was considering transmission lines through her property before this week.\n\n\"We only found out when two people from EnergyCo came to the property, got my husband out of a tractor and said there are going to be transmission lines running through a big part of the property,\" she said.\n\nThe Young family has only been on their Walcha property since early this year. (Supplied: Anna Young)\n\n\"We're only 800 acres [324 hectares] and this will take up a large section of that.\n\n\" It will be something that devalues the property and affects our ability to produce food. \"\n\nWalcha Mayor Eric Noakes said he was disappointed and astonished when told about the revision on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"There've been rumours about it for a long time \u2026 but, as a community, we haven't been involved in these discussions,\" he said.\n\nEric Noakes says he will seek compensation from EnergyCo for property owners. (ABC News: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"There've been discussions about shifting it out of other areas, but no great discussion with anyone in Walcha, either council or landholders, about where it could go.\"\n\nCr Noakes said the council would now be seeking compensation from EnergyCo for landholders potentially affected.\n\n\"It could be up to 30 per cent decrease in land prices because people can't sell their farm,\" he said.\n\n\"Also, on a broader scale, [we want] compensation for the community, money to improve our roads and some legacy of out of these power lines.\"\n\nConsultation coming\n\nEnergyCo said the revision was partially reflective of community feedback and took into account impacts to local roads, the environment and bushfire management.\n\nDeputy project director Julian Watson said the company now wanted to hear from the community about the new corridor proposal.\n\n\"It's unavoidable that there are impacts to private landowners. We really recognise the challenge that poses,\" he said.\n\n\"While there's more people we need to talk to on a 3-kilometre corridor, it does mean that we're more able to take on board that feedback from landowners and from communities to get the best route overall for the final line of the transmission corridor.\"\n\nEnergyCo will hold information sessions in the region this month.",

It's all about being part of something much bigger. I think team success will always trump personal glory for me.\n\n\"I've always been motivated by team success, elite standards and performance excellence.\"\n\nHe also reached out to the club's fans, who gave him a hearty reception.\n\n\"I share in the frustrations that we haven't been where we should be and where we belong for a long period of time now,\" he said.\n\nDemons meet with Oliver Photo shows Clayton Oliver stands with his hands on his head after a 2025 AFL match.

    "text": "The cascade of failures poses a concerning hypothesis: Australia\u2019s emergency call infrastructure may no longer be fit for purpose. Loading \u201cWe should expect that there will be network outages, but we shouldn\u2019t expect that we lose access to Triple Zero,\u201d says Rob Nicholls, a telecommunications expert at the University of Sydney. \u201cWe should expect it to work, and we need all of the carriers to make sure their systems work to deliver it.\u201d The core service is more than 50 years old, but Triple Zero has been updated and modernised over the decades. When callers dial 000, they first hear a six-second recorded message: \u201cYou have dialled emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected.\u201d That simple addition, introduced in 2008, dropped call volumes by around 300,000 per month by allowing mis-dials to hang up before reaching an operator. After the 3G network closure, telecommunications providers are now legally prohibited from providing services to phones that cannot access Triple Zero, requiring devices to support at least 4G or VoLTE for calling. Advanced Mobile Location technology now helps automatically determine caller locations through GPS, Wi-Fi positioning, and mobile phone tracking. Telstra\u2019s current platform, implemented in 2019, has maintained 100 per cent uptime.\n\nModernisation has also brought with it new vulnerabilities, however. The system is now a complex web of carriers, handsets, software updates, automated processes and human operators, with multiple points of failure. And, importantly, the recent failures weren\u2019t platform failures at all. The September disasters were not isolated incidents. In November 2023, a nationwide Optus outage left more than 2100 calls to Triple Zero failing, with at least 300 people not receiving welfare checks when the issue was identified. Optus was later fined more than $12 million for failing to convey or transfer emergency calls. Then in March 2024, Telstra suffered technical issues at one of its Emergency Service Access Points for 90 minutes, resulting in 148 of 500 Triple Zero calls not being transferred. A Victorian man died from cardiac arrest during this period when his emergency call couldn\u2019t be transferred and ambulance dispatch was significantly delayed. According to Telstra internal data, calls to Triple Zero have surged 44 per cent over the past decade, from 8.1 million in 2014 to 11.7 million in 2024. The crises have spawned reviews and recommendations, many of which remain unimplemented. \u201cWithout urgent reform, the system risks becoming obsolete, compromising community safety, first responder effectiveness and the wellbeing of frontline staff.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s according to the National Emergency Communications Working Group (NECWG) \u2013 a public safety body established in 1995 to provide independent analysis of Triple Zero across Australia and New Zealand. It produced a white paper in June. Loading The paper identified a workforce under generational change, outdated operating models from the 1960s, fragmented responses across jurisdictions, and technology that can\u2019t keep pace with wearable devices, AI, and changing community expectations. Craig Anderson is the working group\u2019s executive chair. \u201cThe fundamental principle of how you contact Triple Zero hasn\u2019t changed since 1961,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want services, you need to make a phone call.\u201d He points to generational shifts \u2013 voice calling is diminishing among younger users \u2013 and there are circumstances, for example people who are hearing-impaired, or suffering through domestic violence, in which a phone call might not be the best option.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells has faced criticism for delaying Triple Zero custodian laws. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong \u201cThere need to be alternate channels,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not building these systems for the people using it today. We\u2019re building these systems for the 10-year-olds, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds who, in 10 years time, will be the ones either wanting emergency assistance or will be part of the process to deliver that.\u201d While there\u2019s widespread agreement that Triple Zero can be improved, the carriers themselves should carry the blame for its myriad issues, according to some. Telecommunications expert Rob Nicholls says the carriers need to be investing in network improvements, to ensure resilience. \u201cThe fundamental way that Triple Zero is managed should be fine as long as the network operators do what they promise to do,\u201d Nicholls says. \u201cIt\u2019s fit for purpose when it\u2019s implemented the way that it\u2019s supposed to be implemented.\u201d Multiple investigations will probe what went wrong with Optus\u2019 fatal outage last month. But in the eyes of Nicholls and others, it was an Optus network issue, not a \u201cTriple Zero\u201d issue.\n\nLoading There\u2019s another layer to this crisis that complicates the narrative of pure carrier failure. Industry insiders say a significant part of the problem lies with the devices themselves. When a phone\u2019s home network fails, the handset is responsible for scanning for and connecting to another available network. This \u201ccamp-on\u201d process isn\u2019t instantaneous. Even under favourable conditions, the technical requirements \u2013 scanning available bands, reading system information, identifying a suitable cell, completing attach procedures \u2013 can take 10 to 30 seconds. Some devices have been observed taking up to 45 seconds. For someone in an emergency, that delay feels like failure. As CommsDay\u2019s Graham Lynch puts it: Callers who see no immediate progress often redial, restart their phones or abandon the attempt. Operators reviewing past outages have seen this pattern in logs: alternative networks were available and camp-on would eventually have succeeded, but users gave up first.\n\nComplicating matters further, device compliance is based on manufacturer self-declaration. Australia\u2019s communications watchdog doesn\u2019t directly test devices. Grey-market imports \u2013 like those bought cheaply online or belonging to temporary visitors \u2013 aren\u2019t required to meet Australian standards at all, and may not behave as expected during emergencies. Bushfire season is set to heap pressure on Australia\u2019s Triple Zero system. Credit: Wallcliffe Volunteer Fire Brigade It comes as Australia heads into another bushfire season, and pressure mounts for action. \u201cBefore these devastating outages, Optus was already facing major consumer trust issues,\u201d says Carol Bennett, chief executive of telco consumer group ACCAN. \u201cNow this lack of trust is spreading to damage confidence in our emergency service system itself.\u201d Triple Zero reform wouldn\u2019t be simple or cheap. The challenges span technology, regulation, compliance, human factors and system design.\n\nThe Bean Review, conducted by Richard Bean after the 2023 Optus outage, laid out a road map. Its 18 recommendations \u2013 all of which were accepted by the federal government \u2013 covered everything from mandatory requirements for network operators to \u201cwilt towers\u201d (effectively shut them down) during core network failures ensuring calls can be carried by other networks \u2013 to six-monthly end-to-end testing of all aspects of the Triple Zero ecosystem, to real-time network information-sharing with emergency services during outages. Bean declined to comment for this story. \u2018We should expect that there will be network outages, but we shouldn\u2019t expect that we lose access to Triple Zero.\u2019 Rob Nicholls, University of Sydney telecommunications expert There\u2019s one recommendation that sits at the heart of the solution. A Triple Zero custodian. \u201cThe idea behind the custodian is that it\u2019s someone, essentially somebody peering over the shoulder of the networks,\u201d Nicholls explains. \u201cWhen networks do critical incident exercises, when they practise for when things go wrong, the custodian in the network operation centre will ask the awkward question: what happens to Triple Zero calls at that time?\u201d The Triple Zero custodian would theoretically oversee carrier incident response exercises, coordinate major service disruptions, and maintain a complete picture of the emergency call ecosystem. Basically, someone who has overarching responsibility for Triple Zero.\n\nCraig Anderson says the custodian would help Triple Zero keep pace with technological changes, which are happening constantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve had examples where phone companies like Apple or Google will launch something, and we may know it\u2019s coming, but we\u2019re not necessarily up to speed with preparing for it.\u201d After the 2023 Optus outage, the government announced plans to establish the custodian, but its implementation has drawn criticism for being too slow. The opposition has accused the government of effectively sitting on the plans for nearly a year, while Communications Minister Anika Wells\u2019 office insists that the legislation to beef up the custodian role is on its way, despite parliament sitting for only four more weeks in 2025. The NECWG white paper also calls for AI to help: it could weed out false and mischievous calls, and assist with language interpretation. Anderson sees AI supporting critical decision-making through pattern recognition \u2013 detecting background noises or voice stress \u2013 rather than replacing human judgment.\n\nCarriers like Optus probably need better automated monitoring and testing systems, too. The fact that Optus conducted a network upgrade without properly isolating emergency-call traffic points to fundamental failures in change management processes. Optus chief executive Stephen Rue called the fatal September outage a \u201chuman error\u201d, a people problem. The engineers carrying out the firewall upgrade didn\u2019t follow the prescribed steps. Loading Communication with customers and the broader public during outages is perhaps the most obvious and easiest area for improvement. Following Optus\u2019 2023 Triple Zero failure, new national standards about communication during outages with customers were made, but clearly they\u2019re not working. People attempting to call Triple Zero during an outage need to know immediately what\u2019s happening and what alternatives exist. And as bushfire season approaches, the timing is pointed. The government acknowledged in its Bean Review response that it is not possible to guarantee there will never be another major outage.",

They had a quality side. Sam Konstas celebrates a century for Australia A against India A last month. Credit: BCCI \u201cThe first session, I thought they bowled really well, and it was seaming a little bit. When the spinners came on, since the wicket was a bit flat, I decided to try and take the game on. I was lucky enough to get a few away against the spinners. The innings progressed really nicely, and then I got out for 109.

Credit: Getty Images for Cricket Australia Konstas laughed when asked if it was true. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to reverse ramp first over to a ball on eighth stump. It wasn\u2019t the right thing to do at that time. It happens sometimes. The other innings I was really good. I had a lot of clarity and just reacting to the ball.\u201d\n\nDid the Indians laugh or sledge him about it? \u201cI think they were probably just used to when I played [them] at the MCG and the SCG,\u201d Konstas said. \u201cThey were a very good attack. It wasn\u2019t the right shot to play at that time.\u201d It begs the question: has Konstas really changed his ways? Will there still be another rush of blood when he walks out to bat for NSW this week? It\u2019s certainly a shot that makes purists grumble, but it has been a profitable one for Konstas, and he has never been dismissed playing it. As always, runs are the only currency that matters, but the exchange rate will be high in the opening rounds of the Sheffield Shield, with places in Australia\u2019s batting order up for grabs before the first Ashes Test in Perth on November 21.\n\nKonstas\u2019 scores of 109, 27 not out, 49 and 3 against a quality India A attack were \u2013 to use a phrase that will become a cricket clich\u00e9 over the next six weeks \u2013 a timely reminder of his talent. \u201cI\u2019ve grown a lot from those two or three weeks,\u201d Konstas said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a good reward to have, especially with all my hard training.

Even though I got out for 49, I thought I was it was the best I felt in terms of my mental headspace and the way I was moving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a lot hotter there, and it was about understanding not to hit a lot of balls during training, have that extra time off, just so I am mentally refreshed.

He feels his mental approach is sound, having leaned on his mentor and former Test all-rounder Shane Watson for guidance. Sam Konstas ahead of the Sheffield Shield season.

Clarity and confidence are all Konstas could have asked for, as he embarks on an intense period where every shot he plays is analysed and scrutinised through an Ashes lens. You wouldn\u2019t know it from his relaxed demeanour.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of clarity now,\u201d Konstas said. \u201c[Making runs] does matter for me. Any time you spend at the crease, it\u2019s valuable and builds a bit of confidence. I\u2019m just trying to win games for NSW and just put good performances in for the Ashes, hopefully.

For them to have full faith in me is nice at a young age. To represent NSW is a huge honour. I think we have immense depth, and hopefully, we dominate this year and win the comp. \u201cI know I\u2019m ready for that Aussie [call-up] when the Ashes do come. I\u2019m just trying to score runs and put my best foot forward.\u201d This time, when Konstas walks out to bat at the WACA, there will be a live stream.",

    "text": "2. You find it hard to say no In her book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?, Dr Julie Smith writes: \u201cPeople pleasing is a pattern of behaviour in which you consistently put all others before yourself even to the detriment of your own health and wellbeing. It can leave us feeling unable to express our needs, likes and dislikes and unable to hold boundaries or even keep ourselves safe.\u201d Loading This learnt way of interacting with people not only pushes them towards compliance, it throws up negative beliefs: \u201cIf I disappoint this person they will hate me, I\u2019m selfish if I don\u2019t go along with this, it\u2019s my job to do things for others, my needs are unimportant \u2026\u201d It\u2019s typical for an EPP to perceive themselves as the one who saves the day. This gives them a sense of self-worth; something they desperately crave. But while always saying yes might solve the dilemma in the short-term, there can be lasting risks.\n\nConsider this scenario: your boss asks you to stay late, and although you need to buy dinner on the way home and walk the dog who has been left alone for hours, you quickly say \u201cof course\u201d. At 8pm, as you finish working, your stomach growls with hunger, you suspect the dog has now piddled on your carpet, and resentment swamps your mood. But before you go, you smile widely at your boss and wave goodbye. Sarai Monk is a psychotherapist working in a private practice in London. \u201cOf course these repressed emotions will come out in other ways, sometimes as anger, and there can be a high cost,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen typical EPP patients struggling with passive aggression, demotivation, chronic pain and depression. \u201cOften, this type of behaviour is an entrenched unconscious pattern,\u201d Monk continues. \u201cAn EPP will be constantly monitoring what\u2019s going on and adapting their own behaviour to facilitate the other person\u2019s mood and state of mind. All of us need emotional closeness from partners, friends and parents, but the EPP will experience a continual longing which is rarely fulfilled, thus fuelling the excessive pleasing cycle.\u201d 3. You unconsciously make assumptions about situations Monk says that EPPs often don\u2019t check in with reality. They unconsciously build scenarios or assumptions in their head about what is going on, which means they tend to ignore the facts.\n\nEPPs often struggle to say no, resulting in taking on tasks that push them to their limits. Credit: Getty Images \u201cOne of my patients was going on holiday with a female friend and was feeling frazzled with the pre-vacation build-up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut rather than fly out from his local airport, he drove six hours to the airport closest to where his friend lived. \u201cHis \u2018assumption\u2019 was that his friend needed him to be on the same flight. In my patient\u2019s mind he believed that if he didn\u2019t make this sacrifice, his friend wouldn\u2019t want to go away with him. Driving long distance in a state of stress was preferable to potential rejection.\u201d 4. You put up with toxic relationships Because EPPs stay vigilant about nurturing the requirements of others, they can become ensconced in unhealthy relationships. Back in the year 2000, psychologist Shelley Taylor came up with a stress response theory known as \u201cTend and Befriend\u201d. It refers to how some people, often women, respond when in a threatening or stressful situation.\n\nThe \u201ctend\u201d part involves being caring and keeping others safe; the \u201cbefriend\u201d is about turning to others to feel secure. When a close connection with someone during times of stress is made, the brain releases the hormone oxytocin which helps lower anxiety. Of course, this can be beneficial, but with EPPs, they veer towards tend and befriend at all costs. Not only do they go above and beyond to please, they are more oblivious to the manipulative and damaging involvement of a toxic partner. What\u2019s more, the rewarding hormone boost could endorse that acting in this way helps reduce their stress levels, encouraging them to repeat their extreme actions. An inability to address conflict can result in EPPs tolerating toxic relationships. Credit: iStock 5. You don\u2019t point out a wrongdoing If you inform the waiter that your soup is lukewarm, you run the risk of confrontation \u2013 an EPP would rather eat frozen food. The responsibility to protect the feelings of the other person is so ingrained, EPPs may even believe they are to blame for not ordering a different dish that might be hotter.\n\n\u201cThe sad thing is, it can be terrifying to reveal their true self,\u201d says Menezes Cunningham, \u201cAnd that can prevent them being authentic. Others may have no idea they don\u2019t feel safe enough to be themselves but see through their constant congeniality, recognising there is something off.\u201d Loading Sadly, friendships can be hindered too. If an EPP never puts their foot down, how can a \u201creal\u201d relationship be built? The person who always goes along with everything and never offers their opinion could even be highly irritating and frustrating. Another factor Menezes Cunningham has seen in her years of therapy practice, is the impact on health. \u201cSuppressed stress depletes the immune system and contributes towards serious disease. The body is constantly being flooded with cortisol. Dr Herbert Benson, an American pioneer in mind-body medicine, found that up to 90 per cent of GP visits were because of stress-related conditions. \u201cAwareness of what\u2019s happening is key to building a healthier and happier life. That may not be easy for an EPP because their actions are so embedded, but with the right support you can retrain this default behaviour.\u201d",

The endless checking of texts and Instagram Stories to track someone\u2019s movements. The embarrassing, \u201chey, are we good?\u201d olive branches that feel as weak as a note left under the windshield wipers of a car you\u2019ve rear-ended. The fear of running into them at trusty haunts or mutual friends\u2019 parties. When I\u2019m awake staring at the ceiling at night, it\u2019s not boyfriends I\u2019m thinking about, but the friends whose lives no longer intersect with mine.\n\nThe end of a platonic relationship feels like a particularly sharp pain. Some fall apart suddenly, in chaos and argument. Most I\u2019ve experienced or heard about are less discrete and specific than that. They stretch out and fray, with plenty left unsaid and months or years of two people wondering who will break the silence and neither pulling off the band-aid. Whether they end quickly or not at all, though, they\u2019re equally painful.\n\nCredit: Robin Cowcher\n\nTen years ago, while writing my first book (a memoir, as 25-year-olds in the 2010s were legally obliged to write), I devoted a chapter to the topic of friendships that existed only in past tense. It took the form of a letter and was vague enough to not point fingers at anyone in particular \u2013 including myself. At the time, the change from teens to young adulthood had left a handful of relationships in the dust. There was the person who\u2019d moved overseas and left a trail of shattered relationships in their wake, whose Instagram posts announcing their return to Melbourne no longer inspired me to plan a catch-up. There was the high school friend whose entire identity changed the moment we graduated and became a total mystery. In their versions of events, I\u2019m certain I\u2019d tick some other box in the long list of possibilities for why you stop texting on the birthdays you\u2019ve memorised.\n\nIn the decade since writing that chapter, I\u2019ve learned shockingly little, despite collecting a few more files of evidence. Every person I speak to about friendship break-ups has an almost-identical story, and not one of us can exactly trace its narrative contours. One person told me how she believes her sobriety caused friendships to fade out of view. When the context of a relationship relies on the club, switching for morning walks or coffee dates doesn\u2019t touch the sides, I guess.",

    "text": "With the tax return deadline looming at the close of this month, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has issued caution for the growing number of Australians using artificial intelligence (AI) to prepare their yearly returns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial comparison site Compare Club surveyed 1,000 Australians and found nearly a third were using AI tools to complete their tax returns, with nearly 40 per cent using the technology to manage their personal finances.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found some 36 per cent of respondents were open to using AI for finances, while a quarter said they wouldn't trust it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd more than half of the survey's participants reported using AI most for budgeting, with saving or investing next at 45 per cent and tax preparation at 31 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nATO assistant commissioner Robert Thomson said the office was \"aware\" that people were using AI to complete tax returns and receive tax advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would just issue some caution if people are using AI to help get tax advice because there can be risks associated with it, and we know some of the AI platforms are giving incorrect advice,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI can sound really confident in its answer even when it's wrong, and AI content is only as good as the platforms or content it's taking from.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE See the full list: The biggest Australian companies paying the least tax\n\nThomson said that tax laws could be complex, and differed across countries, so there was an increased risk that the information AI is pulling for you may be incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe urged anyone using AI to prepare their tax returns to check its sources by clicking on the link to the page that the AI is referencing, and to look for credible advice like on the ATO, or from a tax agent or super professional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether you're using AI or not, you are responsible for the information that goes into your tax return,\" Thomson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're still responsible for the information that goes in.\"\n\n\n\nPrivacy risks when using AI to prepare tax returns\n\nThomson warned of serious privacy concerns, not only when using tools like AI chatbots, but also for when you may receive a phone call or email from somebody who says they are from the ATO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're going to give up any of your private information, like your myGov information or tax file umber, what we'd say is you need to to stop, think and protect,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Think about whether you trust the person you're giving information to and whether they can keep it safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Think about whether this could be a scam, and whether that person really needs your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If something doesn't feel right, get in contact with the ATO straight away \u2014 especially if you've given up your information. Not just your tax file number, this can include things like your date of birth, your account details and your current address. Scammers will put all of that information together like a puzzle to steal your identity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThomson said the ATO's focus was on reminding people that if they are using AI for tax advice, they need to be aware of the associated risks, and always check the information with a credible source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that people are probably using AI to maximise their claims around tax time, but we already have more than 40 industry-specific guidelines on our website that explain what you can and can't claim specific to your job, so that's a really good resource for people,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCompare Club's research shows Australians still prefer expert, human advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile two-thirds of people surveyed were using AI more than they were a year ago, financial advisers and government sources were still the most trusted sources for financial advice, scoring 59 and 44 per cent respectively, while AI scored just 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of research at Compare Club, Kate Browne, said AI was a great foundation to build on existing knowledge, but it was \"important to always double check\" your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that people still get information from their family and friends and they're actually more likely to get it wrong, but our recommendation for anything like this is to use it as one of your tools,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowne said it was \"very easy to see AI's appeal\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI is free or low-cost, a time saver, available 24-7, so it's very easy to see the appeal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, she said, the best thing about AI was that it made contemporary, complex information and language accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the reasons people told us they are using AI to get money advice is to break down complex terms, so I think in that sense, it's quite positive. One of the biggest barriers with big financial decisions is that people don't understand, and AI absolutely removes that hurdle,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is general information.

    "text": "Emily Lockwood, a member of Sydney YIMBY \u2014 a group that advocates for higher-density housing under the 'Yes In My Backyard' banner \u2014 said the atmosphere at the Inner West Council chambers in Sydney on Tuesday evening was \"tense\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLockwood, who sat in the front row with her children by her side, told SBS News the energy in the room was \"full-on\" as the council voted on a controversial housing plan that would result in up to 30,000 new homes added to the inner-west area. The council covers 25 suburbs and about 186,000 residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the vote, some irate residents rallied outside council chambers, confronting the councillors who they said were preparing to \"sell out\" their community.\n\n\n\n\n\nHecklers yelled \"bullshit\" when Labor councillors spoke in favour of the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The councillor and council staff really couldn't speak without being interrupted by the anti-housing crowd,\" Lockwood said.\n\n\n\nThe council's Fairer Future Plan, which includes new residential zoning between 6 and 11 storeys around transport hubs and main streets, scraped to victory by one vote, with Labor councillors using their majority against opposition from Greens, Liberal and independent councillors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who opposed the development \u2014 many of whom reject the label of anti-development NIMBYs (which stands for 'Not In My Backyard') \u2014 the outcome was a bitter disappointment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice (not her real name), a member of community organisation Save Marrickville, told SBS News she was unsurprised the plan passed but grateful to the councillors who voted against it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave Marrickville is part of the Better Future Coalition, a group of inner-west community groups that advocate for a 'Better in my backyard' \u2014 or BIMBY \u2014 approach, which calls for appropriate scale and density of developments, as well as meaningful community consultation.\n\n\n\nWhile Alice said she believes housing is a human right and the housing affordability crisis is undeniable, she said the Fairer Future Plan will do little to alleviate those issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do not believe handing over vast swathes of land to private property developers and investors is the way to solve the housing affordability crisis,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Private property developers don't exist to create affordable housing \u2014 they exist to create profit for their shareholders.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for Lockwood and the Sydney YIMBYs, the plan passing represented a victory for housing affordability and keeping young people and renters from being forced out of the now-gentrified area.\n\n\n\n\n\nLockwood said around 60 members of the Sydney YIMBY community were at the vote.\n\n\n\n\"They left work early, they ran from uni, people tried to swap with their partners so that the other person could do bedtime with their kids. It really is amazing for so many people to come out and support housing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, we were really happy with how many people turned out and the excitement that there was, despite the opposition.\"\n\n\n\nGroundswell of community action\n\nAs state governments unroll plans they hope will combat the housing crisis, and Australian suburbs face profound changes in their appearance and population, there has been a groundswell of grassroots community action to influence how these changes do \u2014 or do not \u2014 take place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW government has been accused of \"toxic masculinity\" for its plans to build a new train station and raise building heights at Woollahra in Sydney's affluent east, while the Victorian government's similar upzonings sparked protests in the bayside suburb of Brighton.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany members of these organisations \u2014 and even their founders and leaders \u2014 have never taken part in any form of activism before.\n\n\n\nLockwood said Sydney's YIMBY community had grown \"massively\" in recent years and she has seen the conversations around housing solutions become far more commonplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really satisfying to see the way that conversation has changed and people who maybe haven't been doing activism before recognising that this is something I can do and it's something worthwhile,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan O'Brien, the lead organiser of YIMBY Melbourne, told SBS News arguing for housing development can be attractive as a form of activism because it's easily actionable, as well as being \"tangible and winnable\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's as simple as showing up to a council meeting where there's a seven-storey apartment building going up and being able to show that when our members show up and they talk, these things eventually get approved by the council,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of activism, which is undertaken at local levels and can effect change quickly in communities, contrasts with other important movements like climate action, \"which is much more difficult to affect locally\", O'Brien said.\n\n\n\n\"I think that's been a really good way to get people to come in and get on board and then give up a little bit of their time for the sake of making a more sustainable, liveable and affordable city.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Brien said the most recent mobilisation of the YIMBY Melbourne community was around a Victorian government update to residential planning rules for townhouses, which streamlined development approvals for them across the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our big flashpoint was getting dozens of people to submit in favour of the reforms, getting our policy documentation across and ultimately appearing at the inquiry \u2014 and eventually seeing the entire crossbench, including the Greens, support the reform\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMargo Cashman, a market researcher and one of the committee members of Save Dully, which advocates for a \"pragmatic and positive vision\" for Dulwich Hill in Sydney's inner-west, said their organisation consists of \"lay people\" and residents who have little previous experience in activism.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why some Australian parents are giving their kids as much as $200k\n\nCashman said community activism and interest in housing is growing and community groups help residents to understand the complexities of development plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that's what we're feeling in the community \u2014 it's a thirst for knowledge and to keep up-to-date and be a good citizen.\"\n\n\n\nThe NIMBY and YIMBY divide\n\nWhile the contrast of NIMBYs and YIMBYs is common in media, the identification of these groups can be more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nYIMBYs \u2014 a relatively new movement \u2014 have coalesced under the name, but people who oppose development do not tend to identify themselves as NIMBYs, nor do they operate under groups that use that language.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Awais Piracha, an urban planning academic from Western Sydney University, told SBS News the so-called NIMBYs tend to be people from affluent, leafy and \"white\" dominant suburbs and their motivations for campaigning are less transparent than YIMBY groups.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Rising rates of homelessness among First Nations families spurs calls for intervention SBS News 13:45 English\n\n\"When we say NIMBY, we are not talking about a registered group or a group that would go to a newspaper and say we are NIMBY group,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it would be a euphemism or sort of indication of the broad community resistance to any additional dwellings or development in their area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPiracha said NIMBYs tend to be older groups of people who are better resourced and with time and money for activism, as compared to YIMBYs.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The male breadwinner is gone. Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nWhile community groups may define themselves more as BIMBYs, Piracha said he mostly rejects the term and the call for more consultation or alternative plans from councils is \"just a way of kicking the ball in the tall grass\" \u2014 a delaying tactic.\n\n\n\n'Divisive' language\n\nWhile NIMBY has become a widely-used shorthand for people who oppose development proposals for higher-density housing, many people reject the label and some even refer to it as a 'slur'.\n\n\n\n\n\nCashman said she believes the language \"simplifies and flattens the argument\" around housing and the term shouldn't be employed by politicians or media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think an issue as complex as housing is that simplistic,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I also, on a personal level, never like calling people names and those terms are used in derogatory ways, which I don't think helps.\"\n\n\n\nBut O'Brien from YIMBY Melbourne said he believes the term is appropriate and the backlash against it is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What other term are you going to use? People say this \u2014 that NIMBY is a slur, well, okay do you want me to say 'person experiencing status quo bias'? 'Person who believes in housing hypothetically but is not willing to make any tradeoffs or any personal sacrifice for the sake of the rest of society'?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Brien also said he believes the animosity and name-calling between both sides of the housing argument is more pronounced in Sydney than in Melbourne, likely due to the fact that more money is involved.\n\n\n\nHowever, while battle lines between community groups are drawn on housing around the country, Alice said this uptick in community action has only been necessitated by a housing crisis caused by policy at higher levels of government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It goes to a state and a federal level. A lot of this actually comes down to taxation. There are a whole lot of levers that councils are unable to pull and should be pulled at a federal level,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do believe that it's always been important for community members to stand up and participate in a democratic process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

There's huge investment going into nuclear, there's huge developments that are taking place. And everyone that I spoke to are incredibly confident given the use of AI, given the use of quantum, that they will continue to make rapid developments with nuclear technology.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile avoiding detail, he did admit the policy would be adapted from their pre-election pitch to respond to rapid developments in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Tehan is confident Australia should be influenced by the US model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The amount of investment, the amount of technological know-how going into nuclear, and the breakthroughs when it comes to small modular reactors, or micro-reactors, has to be seen to be believed. And the capital which is flowing into these developments, especially by the large tech companies in the US, is leading to developments which are occurring on a daily basis. And I have a very, very strong view that nuclear has to be part of our energy mix in Australia if we are to be serious about reducing emissions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile details of the policy remain unclear, the Opposition has already committed to some form of nuclear energy as part of a deal with the Nationals to prevent another coalition splinter.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition frontbencher Bridget McKenzie insists the policy wouldn't be in the top five reasons the coalition suffered a heavy loss in the May federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's told Sky News the nuclear debate has to be viewed in the broader view of climate and energy policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the government is flagging poor policies to try and get Australia to emissions reduction targets, pointing to their efforts to encourage a switch to electric vehicles within a short time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Once again, we're seeing the Labor Party pulling one lever for a policy solution, whilst making opposing decisions that aren't good for the country. We know they aren't going to meet their emissions reduction target, so they've doubled down on that and produced this transport sector plan for 2035 that's going to see Australian motorists really do the heavy lifting and pay the costs of emissions reduction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has long criticised the coalition's nuclear energy plan - arguing the nation's energy needs can be met with a mix of renewables and gas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing National Press Club following his election win, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the coalition's nuclear policy a 'last desperate attempt to delay action on climate change'.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe outlined his reasons for opposing the policy in a social media address in December last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here's the lowdown on nuclear power - it will add $1200 to your power bills, it will take decades to build, it will block cheaper renewable energy. Energy experts at the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator have made that clear. Still, Peter Dutton is asking Australians to pay the price for his nuclear power scheme. Never before has so much taxpayer money delivered so little to so few Australians.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nFather of two Mark Burns was in a rut, and like many Australians would unwind with a drink and some TV after a long day of work and family life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after a while, he was developing some bad habits.\n\n\n\n\n\n''I was just burning the candle at both ends mate and decided that come 11 o'clock on a Tuesday night once everything was done, that I deserved a glass of red wine and to watch Netflix until one in the morning giving myself five hours sleep and doing it all again. So not hurting anyone, which I told myself. Except myself really.'\n\n\n\n\n\nWith some encouragement, Mr Burns decided to make a change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I started walking in the morning at the suggestions of my lovely wife Beck to start the day on the right foot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burns' regular walks have since turned into a national movement for men seeking a lifestyle change and social connection; a group called The Man Walk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Man Walk estimates that 136,656 men across 83 locations have got together to have a chat and a walk in the seven years since its conception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The stories from the blokes there are just amazing. It'll be like Mark, I haven't haven't had another bloke to speak to for 30 years, or all the way from that to the Man Walks saved my life and I've lost 20 kilos from exercising every week... now outside of The Man Walk these men catch up and connect and have friendships so we are truly decreasing isolation and loneliness as a health prevention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burns says the group started with just a few men in his southern Sydney community of Kiama, and grew \"by accident\", becoming increasingly popular. While he's enjoyed the health and social benefits of regular walks with friends, he keeps going for a private reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My personal motivation in life is to make, as I say to myself, make my mum and dad proud who I lost many years ago, dad in a car accident and mum with cancer. That's a sort of personal driver for me.\"\n\n\n\nNew research has shown the benefits of social programs for men dealing with loneliness and mental health issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study of 2,000 Australian men found that one in two males aged between 35 and 50 felt stress or anxiety affected their everyday life.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 31 per cent of men said their mental load is affecting their job performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, one in three regional or rural men felt isolated due to their remoteness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research was compiled by Mentoring Men, which pairs male mentees with typically older mentors for free peer support and conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation's Chief Executive Officer, Filipe Gama e Silva, says countless research pieces have painted a stark picture of mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're in a loneliness crisis across Australia. And whether it's our own research or independent other, countless of other researchers research pieces, we also know what the impact of that is, right? And men who take their own lives, men who suicide, men who are lonely are twice as likely to do that. And so that's lives lost, that that's families ruined. The impact is huge.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the men who have accessed mentoring through the group want to talk about relationship challenges, whether it's romantic or familial.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral anxiety around the future is also a common concern, particularly for men in their middle 30's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nearly 40% of the conversations that are happening in a mentorship is around relationships. It's around relationship challenges that they're having at home, whether it be with their children, with their partner, but of course there's conversations around, well, what does the future look like? As I said, the average age of the bloke that we help is mid thirties. It's a big transitional phase in one's life. Life becomes really real. You've got your kids, your marriage, your mortgage, whatever else it might be. There's a lot of things that you're processing\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mentoring Men research showed 42 per cent try to \"push through\" on their own when dealing with their personal challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Michelle Lim, from the University of Sydney's School of Public Health says loneliness is more than just a mental health issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Loneliness and social isolation is also potentially an equity issue. So it predominantly influences or disproportionately affects people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or living in more deprived neighbourhoods with fewer or poorer access to resources in their community. So this is something that is an issue with people who are financially strained. And even if you were having a high income but you felt like you were doing more speaks to the kind of cost of living crisis that we're all going through now we know that loneliness, I guess the risk of actually experiencing persistent loneliness is actually significantly higher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Lim says $2.7 billion is spent each year in Australia because of loneliness and \"health underutilisation\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do expect that this 2.7 billion is very much a conservative amount, which we pay every year already because people are lonely. They might be staying more unwell for longer periods of times, having increased visits to the GPs or staying at hospitals for longer. Those sorts of things do add up and so we are paying the costs. What we don't have is really a proper solution to address that.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The cascade of failures poses a concerning hypothesis: Australia\u2019s emergency call infrastructure may no longer be fit for purpose. Loading \u201cWe should expect that there will be network outages, but we shouldn\u2019t expect that we lose access to Triple Zero,\u201d says Rob Nicholls, a telecommunications expert at the University of Sydney. \u201cWe should expect it to work, and we need all of the carriers to make sure their systems work to deliver it.\u201d The core service is more than 50 years old, but Triple Zero has been updated and modernised over the decades. When callers dial 000, they first hear a six-second recorded message: \u201cYou have dialled emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected.\u201d That simple addition, introduced in 2008, dropped call volumes by around 300,000 per month by allowing mis-dials to hang up before reaching an operator. After the 3G network closure, telecommunications providers are now legally prohibited from providing services to phones that cannot access Triple Zero, requiring devices to support at least 4G or VoLTE for calling. Advanced Mobile Location technology now helps automatically determine caller locations through GPS, Wi-Fi positioning, and mobile phone tracking. Telstra\u2019s current platform, implemented in 2019, has maintained 100 per cent uptime.\n\nModernisation has also brought with it new vulnerabilities, however. The system is now a complex web of carriers, handsets, software updates, automated processes and human operators, with multiple points of failure. And, importantly, the recent failures weren\u2019t platform failures at all. The September disasters were not isolated incidents. In November 2023, a nationwide Optus outage left more than 2100 calls to Triple Zero failing, with at least 300 people not receiving welfare checks when the issue was identified. Optus was later fined more than $12 million for failing to convey or transfer emergency calls. Then in March 2024, Telstra suffered technical issues at one of its Emergency Service Access Points for 90 minutes, resulting in 148 of 500 Triple Zero calls not being transferred. A Victorian man died from cardiac arrest during this period when his emergency call couldn\u2019t be transferred and ambulance dispatch was significantly delayed. According to Telstra internal data, calls to Triple Zero have surged 44 per cent over the past decade, from 8.1 million in 2014 to 11.7 million in 2024. The crises have spawned reviews and recommendations, many of which remain unimplemented. \u201cWithout urgent reform, the system risks becoming obsolete, compromising community safety, first responder effectiveness and the wellbeing of frontline staff.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s according to the National Emergency Communications Working Group (NECWG) \u2013 a public safety body established in 1995 to provide independent analysis of Triple Zero across Australia and New Zealand. It produced a white paper in June. Loading The paper identified a workforce under generational change, outdated operating models from the 1960s, fragmented responses across jurisdictions, and technology that can\u2019t keep pace with wearable devices, AI, and changing community expectations. Craig Anderson is the working group\u2019s executive chair. \u201cThe fundamental principle of how you contact Triple Zero hasn\u2019t changed since 1961,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want services, you need to make a phone call.\u201d He points to generational shifts \u2013 voice calling is diminishing among younger users \u2013 and there are circumstances, for example people who are hearing-impaired, or suffering through domestic violence, in which a phone call might not be the best option.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells has faced criticism for delaying Triple Zero custodian laws. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong \u201cThere need to be alternate channels,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not building these systems for the people using it today. We\u2019re building these systems for the 10-year-olds, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds who, in 10 years time, will be the ones either wanting emergency assistance or will be part of the process to deliver that.\u201d While there\u2019s widespread agreement that Triple Zero can be improved, the carriers themselves should carry the blame for its myriad issues, according to some. Telecommunications expert Rob Nicholls says the carriers need to be investing in network improvements, to ensure resilience. \u201cThe fundamental way that Triple Zero is managed should be fine as long as the network operators do what they promise to do,\u201d Nicholls says. \u201cIt\u2019s fit for purpose when it\u2019s implemented the way that it\u2019s supposed to be implemented.\u201d Multiple investigations will probe what went wrong with Optus\u2019 fatal outage last month. But in the eyes of Nicholls and others, it was an Optus network issue, not a \u201cTriple Zero\u201d issue.\n\nLoading There\u2019s another layer to this crisis that complicates the narrative of pure carrier failure. Industry insiders say a significant part of the problem lies with the devices themselves. When a phone\u2019s home network fails, the handset is responsible for scanning for and connecting to another available network. This \u201ccamp-on\u201d process isn\u2019t instantaneous. Even under favourable conditions, the technical requirements \u2013 scanning available bands, reading system information, identifying a suitable cell, completing attach procedures \u2013 can take 10 to 30 seconds. Some devices have been observed taking up to 45 seconds. For someone in an emergency, that delay feels like failure. As CommsDay\u2019s Graham Lynch puts it: Callers who see no immediate progress often redial, restart their phones or abandon the attempt. Operators reviewing past outages have seen this pattern in logs: alternative networks were available and camp-on would eventually have succeeded, but users gave up first.\n\nComplicating matters further, device compliance is based on manufacturer self-declaration. Australia\u2019s communications watchdog doesn\u2019t directly test devices. Grey-market imports \u2013 like those bought cheaply online or belonging to temporary visitors \u2013 aren\u2019t required to meet Australian standards at all, and may not behave as expected during emergencies. Bushfire season is set to heap pressure on Australia\u2019s Triple Zero system. Credit: Wallcliffe Volunteer Fire Brigade It comes as Australia heads into another bushfire season, and pressure mounts for action. \u201cBefore these devastating outages, Optus was already facing major consumer trust issues,\u201d says Carol Bennett, chief executive of telco consumer group ACCAN. \u201cNow this lack of trust is spreading to damage confidence in our emergency service system itself.\u201d Triple Zero reform wouldn\u2019t be simple or cheap. The challenges span technology, regulation, compliance, human factors and system design.\n\nThe Bean Review, conducted by Richard Bean after the 2023 Optus outage, laid out a road map. Its 18 recommendations \u2013 all of which were accepted by the federal government \u2013 covered everything from mandatory requirements for network operators to \u201cwilt towers\u201d (effectively shut them down) during core network failures ensuring calls can be carried by other networks \u2013 to six-monthly end-to-end testing of all aspects of the Triple Zero ecosystem, to real-time network information-sharing with emergency services during outages. Bean declined to comment for this story. \u2018We should expect that there will be network outages, but we shouldn\u2019t expect that we lose access to Triple Zero.\u2019 Rob Nicholls, University of Sydney telecommunications expert There\u2019s one recommendation that sits at the heart of the solution. A Triple Zero custodian. \u201cThe idea behind the custodian is that it\u2019s someone, essentially somebody peering over the shoulder of the networks,\u201d Nicholls explains. \u201cWhen networks do critical incident exercises, when they practise for when things go wrong, the custodian in the network operation centre will ask the awkward question: what happens to Triple Zero calls at that time?\u201d The Triple Zero custodian would theoretically oversee carrier incident response exercises, coordinate major service disruptions, and maintain a complete picture of the emergency call ecosystem. Basically, someone who has overarching responsibility for Triple Zero.\n\nCraig Anderson says the custodian would help Triple Zero keep pace with technological changes, which are happening constantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve had examples where phone companies like Apple or Google will launch something, and we may know it\u2019s coming, but we\u2019re not necessarily up to speed with preparing for it.\u201d After the 2023 Optus outage, the government announced plans to establish the custodian, but its implementation has drawn criticism for being too slow. The opposition has accused the government of effectively sitting on the plans for nearly a year, while Communications Minister Anika Wells\u2019 office insists that the legislation to beef up the custodian role is on its way, despite parliament sitting for only four more weeks in 2025. The NECWG white paper also calls for AI to help: it could weed out false and mischievous calls, and assist with language interpretation. Anderson sees AI supporting critical decision-making through pattern recognition \u2013 detecting background noises or voice stress \u2013 rather than replacing human judgment.\n\nCarriers like Optus probably need better automated monitoring and testing systems, too. The fact that Optus conducted a network upgrade without properly isolating emergency-call traffic points to fundamental failures in change management processes. Optus chief executive Stephen Rue called the fatal September outage a \u201chuman error\u201d, a people problem. The engineers carrying out the firewall upgrade didn\u2019t follow the prescribed steps. Loading Communication with customers and the broader public during outages is perhaps the most obvious and easiest area for improvement. Following Optus\u2019 2023 Triple Zero failure, new national standards about communication during outages with customers were made, but clearly they\u2019re not working. People attempting to call Triple Zero during an outage need to know immediately what\u2019s happening and what alternatives exist. And as bushfire season approaches, the timing is pointed. The government acknowledged in its Bean Review response that it is not possible to guarantee there will never be another major outage.",

    "text": "Konstas, who landed back in Australia on Monday, is happy to paint an honest picture. \u201cIt was actually a nice wicket to bat on,\u201d Konstas said. \u201cAs the day went on, it did spin quite a bit. They had a quality side. Sam Konstas celebrates a century for Australia A against India A last month. Credit: BCCI \u201cThe first session, I thought they bowled really well, and it was seaming a little bit. When the spinners came on, since the wicket was a bit flat, I decided to try and take the game on. I was lucky enough to get a few away against the spinners. The innings progressed really nicely, and then I got out for 109. All my hard work [is showing].\u201d There was one moment, however, five balls into Konstas\u2019 innings, that the now 20-year-old \u2013 his birthday was on Thursday \u2013 probably wishes never made its way out of India.\n\nA local journalist tweeted that Konstas had once again pulled out the audacious stroke that shocked the cricket world on Boxing Day last year. \u201cSam Konstas has already attempted one reverse scoop in the first over!\u201d Sportstar reporter Sahil Mathur wrote on X. 20-year-old Sam Konstas continues his campaign to secure a spot in the summer Ashes series. Credit: Getty Images for Cricket Australia Konstas laughed when asked if it was true. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to reverse ramp first over to a ball on eighth stump. It wasn\u2019t the right thing to do at that time. It happens sometimes. The other innings I was really good. I had a lot of clarity and just reacting to the ball.\u201d\n\nDid the Indians laugh or sledge him about it? \u201cI think they were probably just used to when I played [them] at the MCG and the SCG,\u201d Konstas said. \u201cThey were a very good attack. It wasn\u2019t the right shot to play at that time.\u201d It begs the question: has Konstas really changed his ways? Will there still be another rush of blood when he walks out to bat for NSW this week? It\u2019s certainly a shot that makes purists grumble, but it has been a profitable one for Konstas, and he has never been dismissed playing it. As always, runs are the only currency that matters, but the exchange rate will be high in the opening rounds of the Sheffield Shield, with places in Australia\u2019s batting order up for grabs before the first Ashes Test in Perth on November 21.\n\nKonstas\u2019 scores of 109, 27 not out, 49 and 3 against a quality India A attack were \u2013 to use a phrase that will become a cricket clich\u00e9 over the next six weeks \u2013 a timely reminder of his talent. \u201cI\u2019ve grown a lot from those two or three weeks,\u201d Konstas said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a good reward to have, especially with all my hard training. The Caribbean was probably the best thing that happened to me. I learnt a lot about myself. NSW and Australian batsman Sam Konstas ahead of the Sheffield Shield season, starting Saturday. Credit: Sam Mooy \u201cAs an athlete, you\u2019re gonna fail a lot more than you succeed. It\u2019s how you deal with your failures. \u201cThe standard was really high. India A played a good team in their home conditions. I was really happy with my other digs. Even though I got out for 49, I thought I was it was the best I felt in terms of my mental headspace and the way I was moving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a lot hotter there, and it was about understanding not to hit a lot of balls during training, have that extra time off, just so I am mentally refreshed. It was a very good tour for me.\u201d Konstas believes his technique is in a good place, having worked closely with his batting coach, Tahmid Islam, since the West Indies\u2019 fast bowlers worked him over. He feels his mental approach is sound, having leaned on his mentor and former Test all-rounder Shane Watson for guidance. Sam Konstas ahead of the Sheffield Shield season. Credit: Sam Mooy Konstas has even worked with a breathing coach to ensure he remains calm and focused as a bowler gets ready to deliver the ball. Clarity and confidence are all Konstas could have asked for, as he embarks on an intense period where every shot he plays is analysed and scrutinised through an Ashes lens. You wouldn\u2019t know it from his relaxed demeanour.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of clarity now,\u201d Konstas said. \u201c[Making runs] does matter for me. Any time you spend at the crease, it\u2019s valuable and builds a bit of confidence. I\u2019m just trying to win games for NSW and just put good performances in for the Ashes, hopefully. Loading \u201cI\u2019ve been very grateful to Greg Mail and Greg Shipperd to have their support. Cricket NSW is my second home, and I\u2019m always there. For them to have full faith in me is nice at a young age. To represent NSW is a huge honour. I think we have immense depth, and hopefully, we dominate this year and win the comp. \u201cI know I\u2019m ready for that Aussie [call-up] when the Ashes do come. I\u2019m just trying to score runs and put my best foot forward.\u201d This time, when Konstas walks out to bat at the WACA, there will be a live stream.",

    "text": "2. You find it hard to say no In her book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?, Dr Julie Smith writes: \u201cPeople pleasing is a pattern of behaviour in which you consistently put all others before yourself even to the detriment of your own health and wellbeing. It can leave us feeling unable to express our needs, likes and dislikes and unable to hold boundaries or even keep ourselves safe.\u201d Loading This learnt way of interacting with people not only pushes them towards compliance, it throws up negative beliefs: \u201cIf I disappoint this person they will hate me, I\u2019m selfish if I don\u2019t go along with this, it\u2019s my job to do things for others, my needs are unimportant \u2026\u201d It\u2019s typical for an EPP to perceive themselves as the one who saves the day. This gives them a sense of self-worth; something they desperately crave. But while always saying yes might solve the dilemma in the short-term, there can be lasting risks.\n\nConsider this scenario: your boss asks you to stay late, and although you need to buy dinner on the way home and walk the dog who has been left alone for hours, you quickly say \u201cof course\u201d. At 8pm, as you finish working, your stomach growls with hunger, you suspect the dog has now piddled on your carpet, and resentment swamps your mood. But before you go, you smile widely at your boss and wave goodbye. Sarai Monk is a psychotherapist working in a private practice in London. \u201cOf course these repressed emotions will come out in other ways, sometimes as anger, and there can be a high cost,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen typical EPP patients struggling with passive aggression, demotivation, chronic pain and depression. \u201cOften, this type of behaviour is an entrenched unconscious pattern,\u201d Monk continues. \u201cAn EPP will be constantly monitoring what\u2019s going on and adapting their own behaviour to facilitate the other person\u2019s mood and state of mind. All of us need emotional closeness from partners, friends and parents, but the EPP will experience a continual longing which is rarely fulfilled, thus fuelling the excessive pleasing cycle.\u201d 3. You unconsciously make assumptions about situations Monk says that EPPs often don\u2019t check in with reality. They unconsciously build scenarios or assumptions in their head about what is going on, which means they tend to ignore the facts.\n\nEPPs often struggle to say no, resulting in taking on tasks that push them to their limits. Credit: Getty Images \u201cOne of my patients was going on holiday with a female friend and was feeling frazzled with the pre-vacation build-up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut rather than fly out from his local airport, he drove six hours to the airport closest to where his friend lived. \u201cHis \u2018assumption\u2019 was that his friend needed him to be on the same flight. In my patient\u2019s mind he believed that if he didn\u2019t make this sacrifice, his friend wouldn\u2019t want to go away with him. Driving long distance in a state of stress was preferable to potential rejection.\u201d 4. You put up with toxic relationships Because EPPs stay vigilant about nurturing the requirements of others, they can become ensconced in unhealthy relationships. Back in the year 2000, psychologist Shelley Taylor came up with a stress response theory known as \u201cTend and Befriend\u201d. It refers to how some people, often women, respond when in a threatening or stressful situation.\n\nThe \u201ctend\u201d part involves being caring and keeping others safe; the \u201cbefriend\u201d is about turning to others to feel secure. When a close connection with someone during times of stress is made, the brain releases the hormone oxytocin which helps lower anxiety. Of course, this can be beneficial, but with EPPs, they veer towards tend and befriend at all costs. Not only do they go above and beyond to please, they are more oblivious to the manipulative and damaging involvement of a toxic partner. What\u2019s more, the rewarding hormone boost could endorse that acting in this way helps reduce their stress levels, encouraging them to repeat their extreme actions. An inability to address conflict can result in EPPs tolerating toxic relationships. Credit: iStock 5. You don\u2019t point out a wrongdoing If you inform the waiter that your soup is lukewarm, you run the risk of confrontation \u2013 an EPP would rather eat frozen food. The responsibility to protect the feelings of the other person is so ingrained, EPPs may even believe they are to blame for not ordering a different dish that might be hotter.\n\n\u201cThe sad thing is, it can be terrifying to reveal their true self,\u201d says Menezes Cunningham, \u201cAnd that can prevent them being authentic. Others may have no idea they don\u2019t feel safe enough to be themselves but see through their constant congeniality, recognising there is something off.\u201d Loading Sadly, friendships can be hindered too. If an EPP never puts their foot down, how can a \u201creal\u201d relationship be built? The person who always goes along with everything and never offers their opinion could even be highly irritating and frustrating. Another factor Menezes Cunningham has seen in her years of therapy practice, is the impact on health. \u201cSuppressed stress depletes the immune system and contributes towards serious disease. The body is constantly being flooded with cortisol. Dr Herbert Benson, an American pioneer in mind-body medicine, found that up to 90 per cent of GP visits were because of stress-related conditions. \u201cAwareness of what\u2019s happening is key to building a healthier and happier life. That may not be easy for an EPP because their actions are so embedded, but with the right support you can retrain this default behaviour.\u201d",

The embarrassing, \u201chey, are we good?\u201d olive branches that feel as weak as a note left under the windshield wipers of a car you\u2019ve rear-ended. The fear of running into them at trusty haunts or mutual friends\u2019 parties. When I\u2019m awake staring at the ceiling at night, it\u2019s not boyfriends I\u2019m thinking about, but the friends whose lives no longer intersect with mine.\n\nThe end of a platonic relationship feels like a particularly sharp pain. Some fall apart suddenly, in chaos and argument. Most I\u2019ve experienced or heard about are less discrete and specific than that. They stretch out and fray, with plenty left unsaid and months or years of two people wondering who will break the silence and neither pulling off the band-aid. Whether they end quickly or not at all, though, they\u2019re equally painful.\n\nCredit: Robin Cowcher\n\nTen years ago, while writing my first book (a memoir, as 25-year-olds in the 2010s were legally obliged to write), I devoted a chapter to the topic of friendships that existed only in past tense. It took the form of a letter and was vague enough to not point fingers at anyone in particular \u2013 including myself. At the time, the change from teens to young adulthood had left a handful of relationships in the dust. There was the person who\u2019d moved overseas and left a trail of shattered relationships in their wake, whose Instagram posts announcing their return to Melbourne no longer inspired me to plan a catch-up. There was the high school friend whose entire identity changed the moment we graduated and became a total mystery. In their versions of events, I\u2019m certain I\u2019d tick some other box in the long list of possibilities for why you stop texting on the birthdays you\u2019ve memorised.\n\nIn the decade since writing that chapter, I\u2019ve learned shockingly little, despite collecting a few more files of evidence. Every person I speak to about friendship break-ups has an almost-identical story, and not one of us can exactly trace its narrative contours. One person told me how she believes her sobriety caused friendships to fade out of view. When the context of a relationship relies on the club, switching for morning walks or coffee dates doesn\u2019t touch the sides, I guess.",
