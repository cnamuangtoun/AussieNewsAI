    "text": "A\ufeff fresh debate has erupted across the Tasman Sea over whether New Zealand should officially be adopted as Australia's seventh state.\n\nKiwi pollster and political commentator David Farrar re-ignited \ufeffthe longstanding discussion and said it was high time New Zealand took up the 125-year-old invitation to become part of Australia.\n\nFarrar wrote in an opinion piece for The Post that \ufeffAotearoa should merge with Australia in the name of security amid rising global political tensions.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. (Getty)\n\nHe said NZ needs to be \"bigger to survive\" and floated the idea of the \ufeffcountry of 5.2 million people becoming an Australian colony.\n\n\"Joining Australia will protect New Zealand, enhance Australia and benefit us all,\" Farrar wrote.\n\nThe writer claimed the Trump administration has threatened the old world order\ufeff, a reference to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech at the NATO meeting in Davos.\n\n\"The rules-based order is gone, and is not returning,\" Farrar added.\n\nShould New Zealand become an Australian state? Yes 529 No 610\n\n\"We are in an era where countries with might will do what they see as right for them.\"\n\nFarrar's suggestion is not far-fetched \u2013 Australia's constitution actually states that New Zealand may be admitted into Australia as a state.\n\nThe Commonwealth colony of NZ also participated in early Federation conferences before it was deemed an independent state.\n\nThere is also a reciprocal agreement \ufeffwhich allows NZ residents to visit, live and work in Australia without a tourist or work visa, and vice versa.\n\nREAD MORE: Thousands back push to memorialise Bondi victim Matilda at playground\n\nFarrar argued New Zealand needs to be \"bigger to survive\". (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nHowever, it appears many Kiwi residents aren't chuffed with the idea.\n\nThe opinion piece quickly triggered similar articles arguing against New Zealand becoming an Australian state.\n\nConservative political commentator Liam Hehir said the country's political independence is not something that should be traded away and argued the country's national identity is something to be preserved.\n\n\"If independence is to end, it will end because it has become impossible to sustain, not because a cost-benefit analysis shows we might do better as someone else's state,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Until then, the task is not to redesign ourselves, but to do our very best to adapt and thrive giving up as little about ourselves as possible.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Scorching heat and high winds trigger extreme fire danger warnings\n\nThere is also a reciprocal agreement \ufeffwhich allows NZ residents to visit, live and work in Australia without a tourist or work visa.

Markets are still priced for rate cuts in the US, UK and Canada, while the European Central Bank is widely expected to be on an extended pause.\n\nMarkets had wagered on a 78 per cent probability of a hike given inflation surprised on the high side in the fourth quarter, while unemployment hit a seven-month low in December.\n\nThe Australian dollar extended earlier gains to be up 0.9 per cent to $US0.7002 while three-year government bond yields jumped 8 basis points to 4.3 per cent.\n\nThe RBA did not raise interest rates as aggressively as its international peers when inflation was running hot due to its desire to preserve gains in the labour market.\n\nThat approach may yet test policymakers. The central bank's three rate cuts last year saw inflation rear its head again, forcing it to pivot towards a hawkish stance late in 2025 and prompting market bets of an earlier-than-expected start to the tightening cycle.\n\n- reported with Reuters \ufeff",

It's our job to make sure that we analyse every single player who you might come up against and see what each player likes to do, what channel they like to run in and things like that.\n\n\"So similar preparation as to what we would if we were playing against some of the other players that we have played against multiple times.\n\n\"It's kind of exciting to see the depth that they have in their squad, and it helps with Commonwealth Games preparation as well, because any of these girls could be selected.\"\n\nGarrett was summoned into the 12-strong Diamonds squad to replace fellow defender Sunday Aryang, who tore an anterior cruciate ligament during Australia's most recent Test in October.\n\n\"Obviously it was very devastating for Sunday and also us, seeing her go down,\" Garrett said.\n\n\"But with netball when people do go down with injuries, it does open up opportunities, and I feel very, very grateful to be here.\n\n\"When the list came out, I did shed a few tears \u2014 I just feel super grateful to be here, and I just want to take every opportunity with two hands if I get the chance to go out and play.\"\n\nAfter the series opener in Adelaide, the Diamonds host Jamaica in Perth on Sunday and Melbourne next Wednesday.\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: Van Haren family)\n\nThe federal government is considering changes to superannuation and bankruptcy laws that would help survivors access their abuser's retirement savings if the perpetrators fail to pay court-ordered compensation.\n\nThe draft law would let survivors apply to the Australian Taxation Office for information about their abuser's superannuation accounts and seek the release of money to meet unpaid compensation orders.\n\nThe proposed changes would also see compensation debts survive if abusers declare bankruptcy to avoid paying their victims.\n\nThe payments would be limited to certain types of super contributions made from the time the abuse began, including personal contributions, and extra employer contributions not legally required.\n\nMr van Haren welcomed the government's attempt to close the loopholes, but said the draft legislation contained \"a few errors\".\n\n\"I think all super should be available to victims, not just \u2026 additional contributions,\" he said.\n\n\"If the government doesn't get this right, then you end up with a cycle where there are all these victims that don't end up having their own super in the long run because they haven't been able to maintain a job.\n\n\" It just makes the victims suffer and not the paedophiles. \"\n\nAndrew Carpenter says the draft legislation does not go far enough. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\nMr van Haren's lawyer, Andrew Carpenter, said the proposed legislation did not go far enough.\n\n\"The original pitch to the government that we made was that it should be for all victim-survivors of child abuse, regardless of [an abuser's] conviction or not,\" he said.\n\n\"The many people who succeed with civil actions should have it available to them, because if a judge makes a ruling that the abuse occurred and someone is awarded damages, why shouldn't they be able to access the superannuation of the offenders?\n\n\" This means that the taxpayer is going to continue to indemnify the sins of these offenders, and the offenders can simply enjoy their retirement and their millions of dollars of superannuation. \"\n\nMr Carpenter said it took on average more than two decades for victim-survivors to report abuse.\n\n\"By that time evidence dries up, witnesses pass away and it is very hard to get a conviction with the passing of that time,\" he said.\n\n\"However in the civil sphere, offenders don't usually enjoy the right to silence and have to take part in the civil action and subject themselves to cross-examination.\"\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland announced the public consultation period on Monday. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nJason Harris, professor of corporate law at Sydney University, said the reforms were a step in the right direction.\n\n\"One thing that is unfortunate is that the period of consultation is only a few weeks, and there are no doubt complexities in these proposals and how they will slot into the tax and bankruptcy system,\" he said.\n\n\"So they will need to be fully considered to make sure that the proposals are going to achieve the victims' goals and help provide them with realistic avenues of compensation.\n\n\" Often when the government has a very short consultation period, it's because they have already made up their mind. \"\n\nA spokesperson from the office of Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Daniel Mulino said the bill was likely to pass parliament over the next few months.",

(ABC News: Emily Doak)\n\n\"They've done everything they can in their power, but if it doesn't rain you can't grow crop,\" he said.\n\n\"They're really struggling and talking about only being able to put in a quarter or less of their crop this season.\n\n\"What we want is for this loan to be able to help them get back on their feet, get through these seasons to when it does rain again, and they can get back to some normality, we keep these good farmers in the industry, and we don't lose generations of farmers.\"\n\nUnder the program, grain and livestock producers will be able to borrow up to $250,000 under a 10-year loan, with a two-year grace period before repayments need to be made.\n\nThe drought forced many SA farmers to either destock or invest heavily in fodder to keep their livestock fed and healthy. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\nThe loans will have concessional interest rates for the first two years at 50 per cent of the Commonwealth 10-year bond rate, after which the rate will match the Commonwealth rate.\n\nLower interest loans on offer\n\nMr Malinauskas says this will be lower than the current interest rate offered by the federal government's Regional Investment Corporation (RIC) loan scheme, which sits at 5.18 per cent.\n\nHe said it had become clear the RIC's loans were not \"as generous as many people in the agricultural sector would like\".\n\nParts of SA recorded their driest conditions in 2024. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\n\"Industry has made pretty clear that the adjustments that were made following the review of the RIC loans by the federal government haven't met their needs,\" Mr Malinauskas said.\n\n\"That's what spurred us into action to say 'listen, there are still a number of communities around the state still very adversely affected by the drought'.\n\n\"Because the federal government's program doesn't work, we're going to do our own.\"",

Raucously popular for almost 150 years, a good Pirates is still a guaranteed money-spinner. This staging, originally by Opera Australia, has been met with laughter and acclaim wherever she sails. Victorian Opera is now at the helm, but audience reaction will be no different. Ben Mingay as The Pirate King. Jeff Busby With comedic plots of clever rhymes sung at rapid-fire pace to catchy melodies, Gilbert & Sullivan is a style unto itself. Pirates is the most joyous piece in the G&S canon, with innumerable proliferations across popular culture, including perhaps the most parodied song in the English language, I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General. VO artistic director Stuart Maunder has fashioned this production with a lifetime\u2019s worth of devoted insight. There\u2019s thought behind the tiniest details; he has squeezed as much funny out as is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Mingay\u2019s much-lauded Pirate King is charismatic and wonderfully riotous, always scene-stealing. He gels naturally with Nicholas Jones, a VCA graduate turned Paris Opera principal artist, as Frederic. Jones deploys his full bag of tricks for this role: effortless operatic tenor, impeccable comedic timing, notably un-wussy sword fighting, even some ballet. Opposite him are emerging and seasoned opera darlings (respectively) Nina Korbe and Antoinette Halloran. Korbe\u2019s coloratura hits every mark perfectly, and while Halloran\u2019s cockney Ruth might conjure up her recent turn as Mrs Lovett, she\u2019s reliably excellent, as is tenor Douglas Kelly as the pirate Samuel. This is just about the best version of Pirates of Penzance you can see. Jeff Busby Stage stalwart Richard Piper (Major-General Stanley) appears more at home with comedy than music. He somehow, on opening night, managed to get ahead of the orchestra during his famous number, though he still landed the laughs. Conductor James Pratt does an otherwise superb job of keeping everyone and everything together, bringing requisite buoyancy to Orchestra Victoria\u2019s playing of the score. One omission sorely missed is surtitles. Though sung in English, diction in the chorus numbers tended towards unintelligibility. Any real pitfalls are those present in the work itself (and some are very dated). With that in mind, is this production just about the best version of Pirates that you could see? Aye aye!\n\nReviewed by Bridget Davies\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMUSIC\n\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAlexandra Gardens, January 30 Across his decades-long career, Nick Cave\u2019s work has always courted darkness: his lyrics reverberate with images of biblical violence, with the ache of loneliness and grief, with the kind of love that goes hand in hand with death. Yet equally, he is attuned to beauty and salvation; to the distant, longed-for possibility of redemption. It is in the tension between these two impulses, never quite reconciled, that the strength of his artistry lies. Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds at Alexandra Gardens on Friday. Richard Clifford This artistry was on full display at Melbourne\u2019s Alexandra Gardens, where an electrifying 2\u00bd-hour set somehow didn\u2019t seem long enough. It\u2019s been nine years since Cave last toured with the full complement of the Bad Seeds, and the band seems determined to make up for lost time. Every person on stage comes to the performance with absolute conviction: from Warren Ellis working his unruly magic with the violin, to the gorgeous textures of the gospel-inflected backing choir, and the magnetic, visceral energy of Cave himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve been on a great odyssey across this country to get to Melbourne,\u201d he says, to roars of approval. This is a show for the home crowd. The set deftly balances work from the band\u2019s 2024 album, Wild God, with cherry-picked tracks from its extensive back catalogue. An early highlight is a searching performance of O Children from the 2004 album, Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus, while Cave\u2019s darker impulses are on full display in the seductively menacing groove of Red Right Hand and the apocalyptic bombast of The Mercy Seat. Nick Cave\u2019s artistry was on full display at Melbourne\u2019s Alexandra Gardens, where an electrifying 2\u00bd-hour set somehow doesn\u2019t seem long enough Richard Clifford While the show contains its moments of pain, rage and despair, these days, joy is perhaps Cave\u2019s primary register. It\u2019s there in the naive lyrics of Frogs, in his open-hearted tribute to former bandmate and collaborator Anita Lane in O Wow O Wow (How Wonderful She Is), and most defiantly in Joy, in which Cave conjures up a ghostly child visitor with a message of hope amid the tragedy of the everyday: \u201cWe\u2019ve all had too much sorrow, now is the time for joy.\u201d A generous, six-song encore showcases some of the band\u2019s best work: from an elemental rendition of The Weeping Song to a sensitive cover of Young Charlatans\u2019 Shiver (perhaps the world\u2019s most accomplished love song ever to have been written by a 16-year-old). A luminous performance of Into My Arms brings the evening to a close: tender, plainspoken, the darkness tempered always by light.\n\nReviewed by Nadia Bailey\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDANCE\n\nMIDSUMMA | Garabari \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMeat Market, North Melbourne, until January 31 Garabari is billed as a participatory event, so there\u2019s no excuse for not playing along. Forewarned is fair warning: you\u2019ve bought a ticket, so you\u2019ve got to help out. It\u2019s not going to work if you don\u2019t bring your dancing shoes. Garabari at Midsumma Festival fits the community mood and travels well. Courtesy of Sydney Festival Yes, at first, it\u2019s awkward. People meander through the large, dark space, drifting aimlessly and smiling apologetically. The soundscape is a disconcerting mix of creakings and scrapings. We\u2019re warming up to the room and to each other. Of course, it\u2019s all part of a larger narrative. We\u2019re already inside a re-visioning of the story of the Murrumbidgee River\u2019s creation. This first part is a time of drought, we\u2019re told, a time of dust and heat and general suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe performers circulate through the crowd and little dances begin to appear: fragmentary routines for two or three or four. Crowds gather and disperse. It\u2019s as if something is bubbling away, building up. Eventually, there\u2019s a short but effective narrative dance showing the liberation of the waters by the youngest and bravest of the goanna women. Huge shadows loom against a curtain as the earth cracks open and land is quenched. After that, the party begins in earnest. Everyone has to dance. The performers keep it moving, calling people in, co-ordinating mass choreography, whooping and hollering and carrying on. It\u2019s diverting \u2013 even if it feels a little forced. It almost recalls the compulsory jollity of cruise ship entertainment or theatre for children, with the performers policing participation, albeit with endless grinning and an ultimately tolerant attitude to refusal. As a celebration of the stories and rituals from the Wiradjuri community around Wagga Wagga and the Riverina, where the show was developed, Garabari is enjoyable, for all its goofiness and happy-clappy enthusiasm. It\u2019s a fun homage to the institution of corroboree. Whether it becomes anything like a true rite of passage, leaving participants altered, is another question. That\u2019s a tall order for such a brief performance \u2013 little over an hour. But at Midsumma Festival, it fits the community mood and travels well.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJAZZ\n\nThe Necks \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, January 29 At first glance, the three members of The Necks are mere musicians. But Chris Abrahams, Lloyd Swanton and Tony Buck are also magicians. How else to explain the way they pull invisible threads of sound from the ether and fashion them \u2013 instinctively, intuitively and moment-by-moment \u2013 into perfectly formed musical tales? The Necks - Lloyd Swanton, Tony Buck and Chris Abrahams. Camille Walsh Photography Now in their 39th year together, the trio has developed the kind of creative communion that makes each fully improvised journey feel both thrillingly unpredictable and somehow inevitable. Thursday night marked the start of the band\u2019s annual Australian tour, and an air of hushed anticipation greeted the trio\u2019s arrival on stage. Sparsely lit and heads bowed, they waited in silence. When Swanton began plucking his bass \u2013 slowly, deliberately \u2013 it felt more like a prayer than a series of notes. Buck\u2019s touch on cymbals was equally spare and reverential, as was Abrahams\u2019 glistening piano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfinitesimal variations in tone and texture were explored, drawing us deep into this meditative realm as the mood gradually darkened. Related Article Melbourne live reviews Even this pop star thinks having her gig at the tennis is a bit weird Swanton\u2019s bass morphed into an insistent buzz, its vibrations merging with Abrahams\u2019 open-pedal piano clusters and Buck\u2019s briskly whisked cymbals. Tranquility gave way to tension, the blood-red stage lights echoing the sense of high drama that was as menacing as it was enthralling. The second set opened in a pool of limpid beauty: exquisitely lyrical piano motifs, reverberant bass and lightly padding toms. Serene, drifting, lovely. Again, the music beckoned and disarmed us, luring us in as the restful sway turned into a more full-bodied swell and then a churning sea. This time, the roiling waves seemed majestic rather than forbidding. Perhaps by now we\u2019d surrendered \u2013 no longer caught in the current but letting ourselves be swept along by it, just as the musicians were. Buck\u2019s torso rocked back and forth, embodying the restless energy that coursed through the music. Agitation and abstraction; hallucinatory spirals of sound; and then, as if by magic, the waves subsided and we found ourselves gently carried back to shore.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHEATRE\n\nThe Placeholder \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until February 8 The shared experience of grief has culminated in many an incisive theatre piece centred on chosen families navigating existential questions of loss, friendship and mortality \u2013 Domenica Feraud\u2019s off-Broadway play Someone Spectacular and, closer to home, Ash Flanders\u2019 Malthouse production This Is Living among them.

Matriarch Pat (Meredith Rogers) is a soft-spoken retiree whose kitchen becomes the focal point of the play, brilliantly materialised by Bethany J. Fellows\u2019 set design. Helen (Michelle Perera) is a widow with a heart of gold and a penchant for baking. A proud lesbian, Keira (Rebecca Bower) self-medicates with alcohol to withstand living in a cloistered town. Barb\u2019s niece Jo (Brigid Gallacher) is the conservative black sheep of the group. And sporty Nic (Oliver Ayres) used to go by Nicole, until they announce they\u2019re transitioning into a man. The reprisal is swift. The elder members of the group, Pat and Helen, paradoxically take it in their stride, but Keira is incensed by the perceived loss of a lesbian peer, and Jo insists it\u2019s all just a phase. The remainder of the play details the fallout of Nic continuously insisting on his personhood against bad-faith arguments and a gulf of miscomprehensions. As the kindest, most level-headed character, Helen is who most audiences will project themselves onto. But Perera, so brilliant in This Is Living, is also the strongest of the ensemble. Her comedic timing is impeccable as she expertly oscillates between empathetic displays of allyship and perfectly executed moments of humour that imbue the play with levity at key junctures. Pat (Meredith Rogers) and Nic (Oliver Ayres) in The Placeholder.

A cookie-cutter bigot, Jo\u2019s views cover well-trodden, odious ground. But it\u2019s Keira\u2019s see-sawing between solidarity and gender essentialism and a self-victimisation that\u2019s impervious to the marginalisation of others that\u2019s harder to stomach \u2013 and altogether more interesting. MacEllen presents thought-provoking contrasts between desired gender-affirming care and unwanted life-saving surgery, gender and sexuality, mental deterioration and newly prized lucidity. But at close to three hours, The Placeholder is simply too long. MacEllen\u2019s script retreads familiar ground in the play\u2019s second act, which drags lugubriously to its emotional climax(es).

Think of all those comments about Heated Rivalry clogging up your feed. It can\u2019t be only gay and bisexual men who were aroused by raunchy encounters between closeted hockey players in the show, or it wouldn\u2019t have been such a huge phenomenon. In fact, women consume almost half of all gay male porn on Porn Hub, and as we enter an age of increasing heteropessimism, it seems homoeroticism has become flavour of the month. Matthew Mitcham (left) and Matthew Predny in a scene from Afterglow. Cameron Grant That\u2019s good news for S. Asher Gelman\u2019s Afterglow. The play bears the tagline \u201cthe climax is just the beginning\u201d, and true to its word, starts in flagrante, with a gay male threesome nuzzling and pashing each other, post-coitally entwined. If you\u2019re jonesing for a Heated Rivalry fix in the flesh, look no further. The show comes fully stocked in the eye candy department, with liberal displays of full-frontal male nudity (the most I have seen onstage since Puppetry of the Penis).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three actors are intimidatingly hot and ripped. Gym-toned physiques. Washboard abs. Bubble butts. And the characters are unabashedly sexual, with tastefully choreographed erotica underpinning Gelman\u2019s relationship drama. Scientist Alex (Julian Curtis) and his theatre director husband, Josh (Matthew Mitcham \u2013 yes, the Olympic gold medallist), are a Manhattan gay couple in an open marriage. Afterglow is non-judgmental about the various forms contemporary relationships may take. Cameron Grant They seem to have it all. They\u2019re handsome, successful and loaded \u2013 and they have a commitment to starting a family together, expecting their first child via surrogacy in a few months. Their equilibrium is fractured when Josh desires something more than a casual fling with their latest playmate, Darius (Matthew Predny), a younger massage therapist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex consents to his partner\u2019s new \u201cfriend with benefits\u201d arrangement, with a veto if it starts to make him feel threatened or uncomfortable. Josh fails to inform his husband of a crucial detail, while seeking to avoid confronting marital difficulties or disappointments in his newfound passion for Darius. Darius genuinely falls for Josh and is torn between desire for what he cannot have and appal that the love triangle he\u2019s entered is causing unintended distress. Related Article Lunch with \u2018Nourishes my soul\u2019: The side gig Matthew Mitcham swears by The set is modular genius that\u2019d put IKEA designers to shame (and allows for steamy shower scenes). And the performances are strong and likeable, lending a charismatic gloss to the unfolding melodrama, even if the underlying emotional dynamics aren\u2019t always fully and precisely articulated. As an examination of modern polyamory, the play is a touch predictable and superficial for my taste. Yet it does have the advantage of being broadly relatable \u2013 whether you\u2019re gay or straight or something in between \u2013 and remains non-judgmental about the various forms contemporary relationships may take. If there\u2019s a message, it\u2019s that you can get hurt no matter what kind of romance your heart leads you to pursue. You\u2019ll be forgiven if you get distracted from it, though, by the sensuality of the sex scenes and the way Afterglow plugs so directly into the homoerotic zeitgeist.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDANCE\n\nSongs of the Bulbul \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPlayhouse, Arts Centre Melbourne, until February 7 The UK-based Aakash Odedra is a superb dancer. His emotional intensity and poetical abundance feel almost radical in the world of contemporary concert dance. He\u2019s a proper phenomenon and still very much in the prime of his career. Aakash Odedra performs in Songs of the Bulbul Angela Grabowska For Songs of the Bulbul he has teamed up with choreographer Rani Khanam to make an hour-long solo from the Sufi myth of the caged nightingale or bulbul. The more the bird suffers, goes the story, the more beautiful its song. The result is a tour de force: a moody, mettled drama that slips between plain statement and lyric suggestion. It is yearning and inward but with plenty of athletic excitement in the combination of rapid Kathak footwork and the loosened spinning of the Sufi dervishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the beginning, Odedra ranges freely across the stage, buoyant and smiling, skirts flaring into blurred halos, bare feet snapping lightly at the floor. Birdlike figurations, with quicksilver movements of head and hand, connect cleanly with happy leaps and turns. Related Article Melbourne live reviews This is about the best version of Pirates of Penzance you could see The pathways of movement become narrower as the cage descends. The bird strains against captivity, projecting anguish: arms reach upward, palms open, sometimes pleading, sometimes offering. The light begins to dwindle and flicker as Odedra collapses, clutching at the red confetti that swirls around him. The soundtrack, by composer Rushil Ranjan, is epic: thunderous percussion, tinkling music-box phrases, blanketing strings and soaring arias. Select UK performances reportedly featured a full live arrangement. One can only imagine the immersive force of such an event. Here, pre-recorded, the intensity is still formidable. Indeed, sometimes, with the strings building and building and building, it all becomes too much, too busy, too alarming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the show\u2019s climax the bird has its eyes removed. This moment is staged with clarity and admirable restraint. It\u2019s the quietest passage, wisely, and therefore the most concentrated. The tragedy lands with the barest ornament, its awful resonance unimpeded. Coming down from that is hard. The closing scenes, for me, fall into something a little too gimmicky: standing before a bank of electric candles, Odedra gestures here and there, lighting the lights and dousing them as if by the magic of the suffering he has just passed through. Still, in Melbourne right now there are few chances to see an international touring dance artist at all, let alone one of this calibre, moving across traditions with such total imaginative surrender and generosity of feeling.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

The Dow Jones dipped 166 points, or 0.3 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1.4 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral influential Big Tech stocks weighed on the market, including drops of 2.8 per cent for Nvidia and 2.9 per cent for Microsoft. Such giants have been hampered by worries that their stock prices shot too high and became too expensive following their years-long dominance of the market. Stocks of software companies and others seen as potential losers to competitors powered by artificial intelligence also slumped. ServiceNow fell 7 per cent to bring its loss for the young year so far to 28.3 per cent. Such declines dragged the S&P 500 to its fourth loss in the last five days, even though the majority of stocks in the index rose. That included a 6.8 per cent climb for Palantir Technologies, which reported a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its forecast for 61 per cent growth in revenue this year also topped analysts\u2019 expectations. Some of the day\u2019s strongest action remained in the metals markets.

Silver\u2019s price, which has been whipping through even wilder moves, rallied 8.2 per cent. Gold and silver prices had been climbing for more than a year as investors looked for safer places to park their cash amid worries about everything from tariffs to a weaker US dollar to heavy debt loads for governments worldwide. Their prices took off in particular last month, and gold\u2019s price at one point had roughly doubled over 12 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut those rallies suddenly gave out last week, and gold\u2019s price dropped from close to $US5600 to less than $US4500 on Monday. Silver plunged 31.4 per cent on Friday alone. Many traders say that what turned the momentum was expectations that President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high to fight inflation, though some disagree. Most agree that simple gravity took over afterward. After gold and silver prices had shot up so much, so quickly, they were bound to fall back at some point, particularly with so many investors piling in to gold as a way to bet on continued weakness for the US dollar. \u201cThe move underscored how stretched anti-USD positioning had become,\u201d according to strategists at Barclays.

Got it Share A A A\n\nStrickland Metals has lit up its Serbian Rogozna project with a fresh high-grade gold-copper discovery, immediately loading the war chest with a $55 million capital raise to accelerate drilling and development studies. The one-two punch signals a clear shift from discovery mode to development intent, with drilling success now matched by the funding firepower to accelerate growth. Core from Strickland Metals\u2019 Red Creek discovery at Rogozna in Serbia showing massive chalcopyrite mineralisation in contact with carbonate. The discovery was made at the Red Creek prospect, about 1km west of the company\u2019s 5.3-million-ounce gold equivalent Shanac deposit. Initial drilling has intersected both shallow epithermal gold mineralisation and deeper skarn-hosted gold and base metals zones - a geological mix that mirrors other major deposits across the Rogozna system. The standout discovery hole delivered numerous zones of mineralisation, including a solid 4.0 metres running at an impressive 4.0 grams per tonne (g/t) gold equivalent from 44.0m and a deeper interval of 53.0m at 2.3g/t gold equivalent from 514.4m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin that deeper 53m zone, the drill bit threw up a 35-metre wide, higher-grade core, running 3.1g/t gold equivalent, including a thick 4.4-metre slice at a stellar 8.9g/t gold equivalent at 522.0m, followed by another hefty 5.8-metre interval grading 4.5g/t gold equivalent from 536.7m. Importantly, Red Creek sits on the same structure that hosts the Copper Canyon deposit, about 1.5km along strike, opening up a new corridor of exploration ground between Copper Canyon and Shanac that has seen little drilling to date. Mineralisation at Red Creek remains open along strike and at depth, with assays pending from several additional holes. Strickland managing director Paul L\u2019Herpiniere said: \u201cOur world-class team in Serbia have done it again, with exploration drilling at Red Creek, just 1km from our cornerstone Shanac Deposit, delivering a new high-grade discovery. This is an exciting development which reinforces the highly endowed nature of the mineral system at Rogozna and offers an exciting new focal point for resource growth.\u201d Hot on the heels of the discovery, Strickland moved to lock in funding, announcing a $55m institutional placement priced at 16 cents per share. The raise will fund an additional 70,000m of drilling across Rogozna in 2026 and support delivery of a pre-feasibility study targeted for the first half of 2027. Backing the story is some heavyweight support. Global mining major Zijin Mining Group has committed $5m to the placement, lifting its stake in Strickland to four per cent. The endorsement from one of the world\u2019s largest copper and gold producers adds serious credibility to Rogozna\u2019s development pathway and underlines the project\u2019s strategic appeal as drilling success continues to stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrickland\u2019s $55 million funding package will bankroll one of the most aggressive exploration campaigns ever mounted in the Balkans, with a massive 70,000m drilling program planned across Rogozna through this year. The drilling will serve the dual purpose of tightening up and upgrading resources at Shanac, Gradina and Copper Canyon, while simultaneously chasing growth at the new Red Creek discovery and testing fresh targets across the broader system. Crucially, the scale and structure of the program are designed to fast-track Rogozna towards development, feeding directly into an internal scoping study in the first half of this year and a full pre-feasibility study targeted for the first half of 2027. This will deliver Strickland\u2019s first detailed economic picture of Rogozna, including costs, production profiles and project returns - the kind of milestone that typically unlocks institutional backing and strategic interest, provided the geology stacks up. With gold running hot, copper tightening and a $55m war chest locked in, Strickland now has both the discoveries and the firepower to push Rogozna hard.

Got it Share A A A\n\nA dramatic sale of 35,000 hectares of defence real estate \u2013 including some of the nation\u2019s most historic barracks \u2013 is expected to raise almost $2 billion to be ploughed back into new military equipment and upgrades to essential bases. Islands, golf courses, rifle ranges, office buildings and training depots across the country will be sold under the Albanese government\u2019s long-awaited response to a sweeping audit of the nation\u2019s defence estate portfolio. Defence Minister Richard Marles and Assistant Defence Minister Peter Khalil announce the major sale of Defence property. Dominic Lorrimer The government has decided to stare down opposition to sell-offs from the military establishment, which has jealously guarded its access to prized sites. The release of the government\u2019s response to the audit has been delayed by over two years as it braces for blowback from veterans and local communities to the sale of some of the country\u2019s most iconic defence facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis masthead revealed on Wednesday that the Victoria Barracks sites in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane will be sold, opening up the possibility of housing developments in inner-city areas. Defence Minister Richard Marles said the government was undertaking the \u201cmost significant reform to Australia\u2019s defence estate in our nation\u2019s history\u201d. \u201cThe heritage value of these properties does not belong to the Australian Army or, for that matter, the Australian Defence Force. It belongs to the Australian people,\u201d Marles said. \u201cAnd right now, the Australian people are prevented from seeing these properties, they exist behind a defence wall.\u201d Acknowledging the long delay between receiving the audit and releasing a response, Marles said: \u201cIt has taken time because it has been difficult. This is a challenging issue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Exclusive\n\nDefence Historic buildings, prime real estate: Defence ready to sell off Victoria Barracks in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane Sixty-seven defence sites will be fully or partially sold \u2013 including the birthplace of the Royal Australian Air Force in Victoria and the army\u2019s headquarters in Sydney \u2013 by the Department of Finance, with an estimated sale price of $3 billion. Relocating staff and remediation works ahead of sale could cost as much as $1.2 billion, meaning net proceeds of up to $1.8 billion are expected from the divestments. The government also expects to save $100 million a year by reducing maintenance costs. All the money raised from the sales, which are expected to take years to complete, will be reinvested into defence. Asked about the scope to expand the supply of housing by selling defence sites, Marles said: \u201cI expect that housing will be part of the opportunity that is created here, but I want to be really clear: that\u2019s not why we\u2019re doing this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is around making sure we have a defence estate which is properly attuned to the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force, and that we are not wasting money on property which gives no capability benefit.\u201d Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said the asset sales would be decided on a case-by-case basis. \u201cI mean, there are some prime locations. I imagine there will be a lot of interest and a lot of views about what it can be used for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful some of that would be for housing, but it really is to be determined, and no decisions have been made.\u201d Assistant Defence Minister Peter Khalil said he was shocked to recently visit a vacant training depot in Penrith, in western Sydney, which had cost $1 million over six years to maintain but was strewn with rubbish and covered in graffiti.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, he said, some salubrious facilities \u201chave grass tennis courts that rival Wimbledon, manicured lawns, sprawling golf courses, but they are also not meeting the operational and capability requirements for our ADF\u201d. The audit, conducted by former Defence Housing Australia managing director Jan Mason and Infrastructure Victoria chair Jim Miller, found the defence estate is riddled with waste and that tough decisions are required to ensure taxpayer money is being spent wisely. \u201cIt is very clear and widely acknowledged that Defence does not need and cannot afford all of the current estate,\u201d Mason and Miller wrote in their audit report, delivered to the government in December 2023. \u201cUnderutilised portions of the Defence estate are draining resources from higher priority needs. Sustainment budgets as they relate to this part of the estate are stretched too thinly, resulting in critical failures and costly unscheduled repairs.\u201d The auditors acknowledged that their recommendations \u201care likely to evoke strong emotions associated with its history, scale and diversity\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA government source, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said taxpayers had been \u201cpissing money up against a wall and it needs to stop\u201d.

Once widespread throughout white-collar workforces in the mid-20th century, only the most senior staff at KPMG will retain Australian-based executive assistants after the planned transition, representing about a fifth of the number it once employed here. Executive assistant jobs have been cut in Australia and sent offshore by KPMG. Eamon Gallagher Under the proposal leaked to corporate gossip Instagram page The Aussie Corporate, there would be a phased approach, with 100 roles shunted from Australia to the Philippines in April and a further 100 across May and June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost-cutting measure, also aimed at improving consistency of service across the business, comes as demand for consulting services has dropped off among the big-four consulting firms. In the year to June 2025, KPMG reported revenue of $2.3 billion: slightly lower than the previous year, while remuneration for its partners grew 10.3 per cent. Nicole Gorton, executive recruitment director at recruitment agency Robert Half, said offshoring can be successful in some cases where work is highly repetitive. \u201cWhere it\u2019s very administrative task heavy, such as triaging emails or formatting documents and entering data, that\u2019s when we\u2019re seeing [these jobs] be offshored,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where organisations see that they can have cost benefit by offshoring.\u201d However, Gorton said it is more difficult for organisations where the assistant is involved in strategy, execution, decision-making and stakeholder engagement. \u201cThese responsibilities require deep knowledge of the business and local stakeholder understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThe EA role has evolved to being a strategic partner who often has input in conversations and decisions. Proximity matters in these cases, and EAs are often the glue to the business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGorton said offshoring tends to be cyclical, but that she has seen an increasing number of jobs being outsourced over the past decade. \u201cA company might do an offshoring project that will be sustainable for a period of time, and then the people in the weeds of managing the offshoring relationships have challenges,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cBut most definitely, offshoring has been happening at a larger scale.\u201d Job ad data from employment marketplace Seek shows personal assistant, executive assistant and secretarial roles have been declining steadily for the past few years. As of December, these roles declined 18 per cent over the year, while wider administration and office support industry roles fell 7 per cent over the same time period and job ads more widely dropped 4 per cent. KPMG Australia last year conducted its own analysis of the fastest growing jobs and those \u201cgoing extinct\u201d, noting some occupational groups had seen sharp declines in workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe number of executive assistants fell by more than 20 per cent to 82,300 over the past decade due to the automation of administrative functions through smartphones and apps,\u201d it said. While roughly 65 of KPMG\u2019s EA roles would remain in Australia, the scope of services covered by every role will change with updated position descriptions.

A spokeswoman for KMPG said consultation with its people was ongoing as the firm moved away from the practice of doing everything in-house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are continually evolving the way we work to build a scalable, modern, resilient business that positions us for growth and competitiveness,\u201d she said.

Got it Share A A A\n\nLast year, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI artificial intelligence start-up bailed out investors in X, his social media platform. Then Musk\u2019s Tesla pumped $US2 billion ($2.85 billion) into xAI, which was burning more than $US1 billion of cash a month. Now he\u2019s caused SpaceX to merge with xAI in a deal valuing the combined businesses at $US1.25 trillion ($1.8 trillion). See the pattern? As one of the companies he controls needs cash, he turns to another that has it. When that proves insufficient, he has looked to one of the two most valuable companies within his orbit \u2013 one without the approvals and governance complexities of Tesla \u2013 to bail them out. Elon Musk is known for his outlandish plans. AP There was speculation that it would be Tesla that would acquire xAI but, while Tesla has about $US44 billion of cash in its balance sheet, the switch of focus from producing electric vehicles to robotaxis and robots that Musk revealed last month and the cashflow-negative impact of the $US20 billion investment that entails probably ruled it out, at least this time. SpaceX planned a float this year, with a mooted valuation of about $US800 billion, which would raise about $US50 billion of cash from new investors. Some of that cash will now be available to xAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe merged group\u2019s valuation of $US1.2 trillion represents a big lift from the most recent valuations of its components as, just over a year ago, the merged xAI and X was deemed to have an equity value of about $US113 billion and a $US20 billion capital raising last month was struck at a valuation of $US230 billion. Related Article Opinion\n\nAI Robots, redundancies and runaway spending: Not all AI hits the mark Elizabeth Knight Business columnist For the purposes of the merger, xAI is now valued at $US250 billion, while SpaceX\u2019s value has jumped to $US1 trillion and there\u2019s talk of the IPO producing a $US1.5 trillion valuation. The numbers, and their escalation, are mind-blowing, but so are artificial intelligence\u2019s appetite for capital and Musk\u2019s visions. xAI is one of the minnows competing with giants in the hugely capital-intensive race to stake out a position in AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere giants like Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have torrents of cashflow from their legacy businesses to fund the hundreds of billions of dollars they are ploughing into AI \u2013 and even they are now having to raise external debt because of the scale of the spending on training large language models and building data centres \u2013 start-ups like xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic are reliant on seemingly endless rounds of equity raisings (and, increasingly, debt issues) at ever-greater valuations. The sector\u2019s insatiable appetite for capital has outstripped the capacity or willingness of equity markets to supply it, hence the increasing levels of debt in the sector and the incestuous deals between its participants. Musk himself said the rationale for the merger was that, within two or three years, the least expensive way to do AI computations would be in space. AP On some estimates, the four or five heavyweight players in the sector will spend about $US500 billion over the next three years. It wouldn\u2019t surprise if it were significantly more. This is an extraordinary period of highly focused and extraordinarily capital-intensive industry development. At some point, perhaps quite soon, there\u2019ll be either a consolidation of the sector or a wipeout of its weaker players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA puncturing of the ever-inflating, and arguably already highly inflated, valuations would force rationalisation (and cause a lot of pain for the companies and their investors and lenders) if the equity spigot were turned off. Related Article Analysis\n\nAI \u2018Absolute nightmare\u2019: The social network where AI chatbots exchange ideas and gossip about humans With the enlarged SpaceX not the only big AI-tinged float planned for this year \u2013 OpenAI and Anthropic have theirs on drawing boards \u2013 the market\u2019s willingness to continue to support financial models that involve massive outlays today for uncertain returns in three, four or five years\u2019 time will be stress-tested. That\u2019s why, as was the case when xAI was used to bailout investors in X (who were badly underwater on their investments), Musk has turned to SpaceX and its ability to raise a very big lump of cash \u2013 at $US50 billion, an IPO equity raising would be the biggest in history, dwarfing the $US29 billion raised by Saudi Aramco in 2019 \u2013 just to keep xAI in the game. The industrial logic for combining Space X with xAI is thin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are not many synergies between launching rockets and operating a network of satellites, an AI start-up that lags its competitors and a controversial social media platform where the interest on its debt absorbs roughly half its revenues. xAI\u2019s Grok chatbot doesn\u2019t have the users or financial backers (almost the entire AI sector) that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has, nor the distribution platform of Google\u2019s Gemini or the corporate acceptance of a rival start-up, Anthropic (which moved markets with the release of new AI productivity tools on Tuesday). xAI is getting a helping hand. Bloomberg SpaceX said it was acquiring xAI to \u201cform the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile communications and the world\u2019s foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\u201d Musk himself said the rationale for the merger was that, within two or three years, the least expensive way to do AI computations would be in space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe envisages putting AI data centres into space on SpaceX\u2019s rockets and said there would be cost efficiencies that would enable innovative companies to train their models and process data at unprecedented speeds and scales. \u201cThis marks not just the next chapter but the next book in SpaceX and xAI\u2019s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars,\u201d he said, whatever that means. Maybe the future of AI and the data centres needed to support it lies in space, but Musk seems to have skated over the logistics and costs of building something in space that is already stretching, to their limits, AI companies on Earth. The sector\u2019s insatiable appetite for capital has outstripped the capacity or willingness of equity markets to supply it, hence the increasing levels of debt in the sector and the incestuous deals between its participants. There is some financial logic to the combination, given that SpaceX is cashflow positive \u2013 it appears to have generated more than $US2 billion of positive cashflow last year and is on a steeply rising curve \u2013 while xAI churned through $US9.5 billion in the first nine months of last year at an annualised rate of more than $US12.5 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears obvious, however, that the capital SpaceX raises in its IPO will be quickly devoured by xAI unless the industry trend of capital expenditures rising at a much greater rate than revenues can be reversed. Related Article Opinion\n\nBillionaires Why Australian billionaires are falling behind their uber rich peers Elizabeth Knight Business columnist Musk does, of course, still have Tesla, valued by the market at more than $US1.5 trillion, that he could merge into a Musk Inc conglomerate if he needs more cash (and if its change in strategy from EVs to robotaxis and robots produces cashflows and earnings to validate the valuation). On his track record, such a merger appears quite a likely eventuality, particularly if xAI\u2019s demands for cash outstrip SpaceX\u2019s ability to generate it. Musk\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d for SpaceX appears fanciful. He has, however, demonstrated a remarkable capacity to convince investors to capitalise his visions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData centres in space, transported by SpaceX rockets, fed by xAI\u2019s models that have trained on X\u2019s data, perhaps with some future input from Tesla\u2019s engineers and with roles for its robots? It all sounds fantastical but, if he gets a $US1.5 trillion valuation for SpaceX in its float, it would signal that there are plenty of investors who think his vision can be realised.

In recent years, the research has moved away from the impact of individual \u201csuperfoods\u201d and antioxidants to focus on how overall, long-term dietary habits affect risk. That\u2019s not to say that any individual cancer diagnosis can be blamed on someone\u2019s diet; cancer, after all, arises as a result of a large constellation of factors \u2013 and it occurs in people who make healthy choices. Decades of research suggests that your diet can influence the risk of various cancers. Getty Images/iStockphoto But on a population level, there are some trends in the data. Here\u2019s what we know. Prioritise plants\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEating patterns that emphasise whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean or plant-based proteins have shown the most consistent association with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. One reason may be that people who follow these eating patterns have lower levels of insulin and inflammation, said Fred Tabung, who studies diet, metabolism and cancer at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Centre. Related Article Health This little organ is rarely thought about \u2013 and it\u2019s costing lives Chronically high levels of insulin and inflammation are key features of obesity and metabolic syndrome, which mediate cancer risk. High insulin and inflammation also promote unnecessary cell division, cell growth, DNA damage and the inhibition of cell death, which are all hallmarks of cancer, Tabung said. Whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and legumes and nuts contain lots of dietary fibre, which has been associated with lower cancer risk. This may be because fibre helps speed stool along the digestive tract, limiting exposure to carcinogens, and because it feeds microbes in the gut that help protect against inflammation, said Dr Kimmie Ng, associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Tabung added that leafy, green vegetables like lettuce, kale, spinach and arugula, and dark yellow vegetables like carrots, yams and squash, when part of a broader dietary pattern, appeared to promote lower levels of insulin and inflammation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChoose your meat carefully The International Agency for Research on Cancer has labelled processed meat like bacon, salami and hot dogs as carcinogenic to humans. The agency has said red meat is \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d due to limited but strong evidence. Research has shown that the type of iron in red meat, as well as the chemicals formed when red meat is cooked at high temperatures, for example during grilling and smoking, produce compounds involved in DNA damage. Nitrates and nitrites in processed meats have also been strongly associated with cancer. Nutrition and cancer researchers recommend avoiding processed meats altogether, and limiting red meat to two to three servings per week. If you are going to grill, use an acidic marinade, like one that\u2019s citrus- or vinegar-based, as that can help reduce the amount of carcinogens formed, said Carrie Daniel-MacDougall, a professor of epidemiology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre. Or instead eat fish, which may independently lower cancer risk, said Dr Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist at Mass General Brigham. Limit ultra-processed foods There is increasing evidence linking ultra-processed foods, including sugar-sweetened beverages, to cancer. One reason might be that they tend to be high in sugar and calories, which can contribute to insulin resistance and obesity. But lab studies also suggest that chemicals in these foods alter the balance between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d gut microbes and damage the gut lining, promoting inflammation, Chan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study of a large French cohort showed that several common preservatives increased the risk of all cancer, and particularly breast and prostate cancer. About a third of the preservatives that subjects consumed came from ultra-processed foods, but they were also found in alcohol, dried or canned fruits, and packaged vegetables. Related Article Nutrition Can we call butter and beef tallow \u2018healthy fats\u2019? You can limit your intake of preservatives by buying whole, fresh or frozen produce and prepared foods made only with ingredients you might find in a household kitchen, said Mathilde Touvier, director of the nutritional epidemiology research team at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research. Drink less, or not at all The risks of alcohol are greatest for heavy and binge drinkers, but even light drinking increases the risk of some cancers. \u201cThere\u2019s no safe level for cancer risk,\u201d said Giota Mitrou, executive director of research and policy for the American Institute for Cancer Research. \u201cLess is better and avoiding is best,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study, for example, showed that consistent heavy alcohol intake and higher lifetime consumption (averaging 14 or more drinks per week) increased the risk of colorectal cancer; quitting appeared to lower the risk. Alcohol may cause cancer in a few ways, Mitrou said. The body breaks it down into acetaldehyde, which is toxic to cells. Alcohol increases levels of estrogen, which fuels some types of breast cancer. And it has been linked to oxidative stress \u2014 when the body produces too many unstable molecules that react with DNA \u2013 and may interfere with DNA repair. If you do drink, avoid doing so on an empty stomach. Drinking without food may result in a higher exposure to carcinogens, Ng said. Consider coffee, tea and dairy Tabung found that drinking up to three cups of coffee or tea per day was associated with lower levels of insulin resistance and inflammation. Coffee and tea are full of chemicals that help protect cells from damage, said Robin Ralston, a dietitian and nutritionist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Centre. She encourages drinking them \u2013 whether hot or cold, brewed at home or drunk from a bottle \u2013 as long as there isn\u2019t added sugar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDairy, and the calcium in it, appears to lower colorectal cancer risk. As part of a broader healthy diet, full-fat dairy \u2013 which was recently endorsed in new federal dietary guidelines \u2013 was also associated with reduced inflammation and insulin resistance in some studies. Ralston recommended fermented dairy like plain yoghurt, kefir and cheese because they can support gut health and have been associated with reduced inflammation in several studies. Related Article Fitness The goal posts for a longer, healthier life are closer than you think Know the risks of obesity The clearest link between diet and cancer is through obesity. A large body of evidence has linked obesity to more than a dozen cancers, including breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, kidney, liver and pancreatic cancers. Obesity, of course, is not just the product of diet, but also physical activity, genetics and other factors, said Edward Giovannucci, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But to the extent that diet leads to excess body fat or body weight, that is likely \u201cthe biggest single impact of diet on cancer risk,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFat tissue increases estrogen, which is a driver for some kinds of breast and endometrial cancer. Fat that accumulates in the abdomen, called visceral fat, promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, Giovannucci said. Exercise \u2013 at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week \u2013 can increase insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation, in addition to helping with weight loss. Some early research has suggested that GLP-1 drugs may also reduce cancer risk, but evidence is limited. Maintaining a healthy body weight and exercising to promote good metabolic health are \u201ca big part of the battle,\u201d Giovannucci said \u2013 and not only to lower cancer risk. \u201cIt overlaps a lot with diabetes, cardiovascular risks and dementia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all tied together.\u201d This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

So some people do the right thing and pay more to do the right thing with their packaging, and others don't.\"\n\nThe federal environment department is weighing up options for packaging reform to put to the government.\n\n\"We'd love to hear some announcement from the environment minister on that,\" Kiernan said.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

I kind of just froze, and I was like: 'Did that really just happen?' \"\n\nAfter speaking to a co-worker and raising it with their manager, Ezra says it soon became clear that the harassment wasn't being taken seriously.\n\n\"I think I cried in the bathroom that day and when I got home as well. But she said she'd bring it up to his manager. Then it got taken to the big manager, and they spoke to him, but nothing really came of it. I didn't feel like I was well-supported or safe in the workplace. I had a lot of anxiety and was struggling with anxiety attacks due to that. They wanted me to come back into work. I was trying to ask if I can go to a different floor or, like, area to him or to be transferred to a different department, and they just refused it. They were like, 'No.' Um, and I ended up quitting. I mean, my mental health wasn't doing great anyway while working there, but I did end up leaving that job, and I haven't, I haven't worked full time since working at that bank.\"\n\nIt's been just over 50 years since South Australia became the first Australian state to decriminalise male homosexuality.\n\nIt's been almost a decade since Australians voted in favour of same-sex marriage laws.\n\nRepresented in politics, pop culture and even professional sport, it might seem like the push for greater LGBTIQ+ inclusion has done what it set out to do.\n\nBut that isn't the case.\n\nRecent data from Diversity Council Australia shows workplace discrimination against queer and gender diverse employees is increasing.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me. We know that discrimination has always been a huge problem for our communities. It can destroy lives, and of course, it's terrible for employers as well, in terms of the impacts on staff wellbeing, workplace health and safety, and financial impact as well.\"\n\nHeather Corkhill is the Legal Director of Equality Australia.\n\nShe says a rise in hate speech in Australia more broadly is exacerbating the issue.\n\n\"One of the problems, of course, is that there is an increasing issue of escalating hate speech against our communities. And of course, workers are also people with lives outside of work too, and can be influenced by disinformation, negative media and social media about our communities too.\"\n\nIn a recent survey of 3,000 workers across Australia, the research found that almost half of LGBTIQ+ workers had experienced workplace discrimination and / or harassment in the past year.\n\nMarking a 24 per cent increase since the 2024 survey, the Diversity Council says the findings suggest not enough has been done to prevent this behaviour.\n\nCharlie Hamra is the President of Pride in Law South Australia.\n\nHe says while exclusion in the workplace can often be a result of othering and a lack of understanding, it can also be more overt.\n\n\"I'm aware of a situation where a trans lawyer has been deadnamed* in a courtroom by a judge, and so things can be really that overt in terms of, you know, you come to work and being deadnamed. But there can also be the kinds of, sort of microaggressions, assumptions being made about a person's sexuality, or gender, just each of those little things which can add up on a day-to-day basis. You know, people assuming the gender of one's partner, and so on. Or even going so far as to sort of make inappropriate sexual comments or inappropriate jokes, which are sexual harassment, but which are sort of laughed off as being a bit of a joke.\"\n\nDiversity Council Australia says this isn't about isolated incidents in the workplace, it's persistent exclusion.\n\nAhead of recent Hate Speech legislation passed following the Bondi terror attack, some rights groups called on the government to include stronger protections against LGBTIQ+ discrimination.\n\nHeather Corkhill says the community has been left out of legislation that could make a real difference.\n\n\"At the moment, there's a requirement that employers are required to actively prevent sex discrimination, harassment, before it occurs. But these reforms left us out, much like the recent hate crime reforms did as well, and LGBTIQ+ people deserve the same protection from hate speech and discrimination. We think that a positive duty to eliminate discrimination would improve workplace culture and not just respond after the damage is done.\"\n\nThe Council says periods of heightened social polarisation around identity can create conditions where people feel more emboldened to show prejudice at work.\n\nWith the rising prominence of neo-Nazi groups in Australia and laws undoing or limiting gender-affirming care for young people in parts of the country, discriminatory language and negative media attention on the community can normalise discrimination.\n\nWhether intentional or not, workplace discrimination creates environments where more serious harms can occur.\n\nCharlie Hamra says the current processes in place mean such incidents often go unreported.\n\n\"We've got these huge numbers of LGBTQIA+ people experiencing discrimination or harassment at work and that's unsurprising to us. You know, we're hearing about that at the moment on the ground. And what I'll say is that while we've got this, we might have this protection sort of on its face, the nature of the way that the process is means that people aren't making complaints and so over the course of a five-year period, we only had 39 complaints to the Equal Opportunity Commission in South Australia.\"\n\nTo address this, rights groups say there needs to be more investment in dedicated legal services for LGBTIQ+ employees.\n\n\"Because if you're a LGBTQI+ person who's being discriminated against in the workplace, it would make all the difference to be able to go to a service that is staffed and designed by LGBTQI+ people, a legal service, to be able to go to them for legal assistance in navigating the anti-discrimination framework.\"\n\nIn addition, experts say employers can go beyond symbolic gestures of inclusion by forming Pride Committees at work, providing training about discrimination and making clear to employees that discrimination in any form won't be accepted.\n\nA full report on the broader state of inclusion in the Australian workforce the past year is due out later this month.\n\nThese days, Ezra is a writer and does advocacy work.\n\nThey say the ability to be themselves means they can put their energy back into their work.\n\n\"Well, a combination of things really, like having, having a support network around me, you know, utilising my support workers that I have due to psychosocial disability, but also being now in an environment where I do feel like I belong, and it's safe, and I can be myself. Because I feel like being able to be myself in the workspace and not having to consciously, like, hide that and put the mental energy into that means that I can put the energy into work.\"",

We're actually in a really good position. The labour market is really strong, and domestic demand is recovering. These are good things, but it's just that we're supply constrained, and we think we're even a little more constrained than we thought back a little while ago. So, yes, the strategy still is trying to bring the economy back into balance and the labour market back into balance, without over overshooting.\"\n\n+++\n\nThe Race Discrimination commissioner is warning the use of the phrase \u201csocial cohesion\u201d by politicians is undermining progress towards a harmonious society.\n\nGiridharan Sivaraman says the phrase is being used as code for assimilation, and to avoid talking about the problem of racism, which he says Australians find hard to talk about.\n\nMr Sivaraman says people calling out racism get attacked more than racists.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has used the term \u201csocial cohesion\u201d more than 35 times in public speeches since the Bondi massacre in December.\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley has used the term at least 24 times since she assumed her job in May of last year.\n\n+++\n\nA coalition of eleven disability groups have cautiously welcomed a three-month delay to the Thriving Kids program, which will begin in October, three months later than planned.\n\nThe Thriving Kids program aims to increase the role of states in providing services for children with mild to moderate autism, or developmental delays.\n\nDetails of the delivery model and funding arrangements have only been revealed, months after families first raised their concerns.\n\nThe National Ethnic Disability Alliance's Sadikshya [[Sa-dik-sha]] Dulal says the uncertainty has been tough diverse families.\n\n\"It's not just navigating disability systems. They're doing so across language barriers, cultural differences and how disability is understood, and they do this often with limited prior knowledge of available support. So when information isn't available in community languages, or when co-design does not actively engage diverse communities, or when workforce training does not include cultural competency, these families fall through the gaps, and this is where we feel the delay must be used to build equity into the foundations.\"\n\n+++\n\nThe U-S military says it has shot down an Iranian drone after it flew towards the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea.\n\nIt says the Shahed-139 drone approached the carrier at speed with unclear intent, prompting an F-35 fighter jet to bring it down in what it called a defensive move to protect the ship and its crew.\n\nNo personnel were injured and no equipment was damaged.\n\nHours later, Central Command reported a second confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz, saying Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats and a drone closed in on a U-S-flagged merchant vessel at high speed and threatened to seize it, before pulling away.\n\n+++\n\nU-N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has reaffirmed the inalienable rights of Palestinians, warning that 2026 could prove decisive for peace as Gaza and the West Bank continue to endure deepening hardship.\n\nHis remarks came as the Rafah crossing reopened on a limited basis, with Mr Guterres calling for rapid and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nHe also warned that continued Israeli settlement expansion, demolitions and displacement in the occupied West Bank threaten territorial contiguity and deal a serious blow to the viability of a two-state solution.\n\nAddressing the UN\u2019s Economic and Social Council, Mr Guterres said the world faces a critical moment\n\n\u201cFor 50 years, this committee has stood firm in defending a simple truth: the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people \u2013 including the right to self-determination \u2013 must be realised and respected, fully, consistently and without delay. We enter 2026 with the clock ticking louder than ever. Will the year ahead bend towards peace \u2013 or slip into the abyss of despair?\u201d\n\n+++\n\nThe Sudanese army says it has broken a years-long siege on the city of Kadugli, potentially providing tens of thousands of people a reprieve from famine.\n\nThe conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ((RSF)) has displaced millions, drawn in regional powers and caused a vast humanitarian crisis since it broke out in April 2023.\n\nThe end of the seige at Kadugli signals a shift in the war's momentum.\n\nThe army said in a statement that they succeeded in opening the Kadugli-Dalanj road, after what they called 'a heroic battle'.\n\n+++\n\nIn skiing, one of the United States' most-celebrated Olympic athletes claims she can makes one of sport's most remarkable comebacks from injury at the Winter Olympics next week.\n\n2010 gold medal winner Lindsey Vonn tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee competing in Switzerland four days ago.\n\nThat's an injury that usually requires six to nine months of rehabilitation.\n\nBut Vonn believes she can compete in the women's downhill event at the Olympics in Italy next Monday.\n\nThe 41-year-old claims her knee actually feels better than it has at times in the past.\n\n\"I still need to do the downhill training run. But I also know what my knee has felt like with previous injuries in the gym and what it's felt like during all the physical tests. And I can say that I feel a lot better right now than I have in the past. I feel a lot better right now than I did in 2019 for the last World Championships.\"\n\nThe Milan-Cortina Winter Olmypics begin on Saturday.",

    "text": "What do you get when you mix a love for navigating ascents and descents and snow? Ski mountaineering, of course.\n\nOtherwise, known as \"skimo\", this winter sport will be debuting at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, which start on 6 February. The schedule will include sprint races and mixed relays.\n\nThe sport has a rich history, steeped in practical mountain travel and military patrol competitions.\n\nHowever, skimo was only recognised by the International Olympic Committee almost 100 years after other winter sports such as ice skating and ski jumping.\n\nLISTEN TO Has the Olympics done its dash? SBS News 07:55 English\n\nThe sport combines elements of cross country, alpine skiing and mountaineering.\n\nWhat is skimo?\n\nAthletes sprint uphill with fabric strips called 'skins' on the bottoms of their skis, which grip the snow. They then attach their skis to a special backpack, run a section of the course in boots, and then turn their boots into downhill mode to race downhill.\n\nThe sprint races are over in a couple of minutes.\n\nSo, how did two Australians \u2014 Phil Bellingham, 34, and Lara Hamilton, 27, end up competing in skimo's first Olympic events?\n\nFor Bellingham, this will be his fourth Winter Olympics, having competed in cross-country skiing at Sochi 2014, PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022.\n\nHamilton, from Sydney's north shore, will be making her Winter Olympics debut. Her background is in Nordic skiing and trail running, but last year she made skimo her focus and qualified for the Australian team at this year's Games.\n\nHamilton told SBS News the speeds athletes are sprinting uphill at produce a huge amount of lactic acid \u2014 but she finds the descent after the climb in ski mountaineering the biggest challenge.\n\n\"My legs are shaking, I'm feeling delirious, and I'm expected to do these precise movements as quickly as possible,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like you suddenly stop and you need to do this manipulation of the gear. So I guess learning how to calm to be able to do that after an all-out effort has been my biggest challenge.\"\n\nBellingham, who hails from Victoria's High Country, said TV viewers should be aware just how steep the decline is.\n\n\"It kind of just looks like people walking along quite slowly on skis, but it's actually a really steep ski run,\" he told SBS News.\n\nFrom cross-country skiing to ski mountaineering\n\nBellingham almost hung up his skis following the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, but cross-country skiing program director Finn Marsland encouraged him to give skimo a go.\n\nHe said he'd always been interested in the sport.\n\n\"I had always done a lot of backcountry skiing and downhill skiing, so I decided to give it a go in the 2023 season ... it was a bit of a rough start, but it turned out okay and I enjoyed doing it.\"\n\nThe Milano Cortina Winter Olympics will be Phil Bellingham's fourth games. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts\n\nHamilton, who grew up skiing and running, focused on running after high school after she landed a cross country scholarship in the United States.\n\nBut during her university winter breaks she kept up her skiing in the slopes of Colorado, until she saw some people ski mountaineering, and thought she would give it a go.\n\n\"I was backcountry skiing, but on a super heavy setup, not the setup that we know for skimo,\" she said.\n\n\"I had some friends in Colorado who were doing similar sports, so they gave me some advice on what to get ... so I bought my first setup secondhand, super crappy and just started doing [skimo] in the evenings around the resort.\"\n\nHamilton officially moved to Colorado in 2022 where she competed in her first races, and followed the US circuit, competing in her first World Cup in 2024.\n\n\"I learnt (through) trial by fire, but it\u2019s been a really good journey.\"\n\n'You do have to make a lot of sacrifices'\n\nAfter buying her first setup on Facebook marketplace, Hamilton soon realised she'd need a better one.\n\n\"I was like: 'How the hell am I going to afford this?'\"\n\nAt 27 years-old, Lara Hamilton is making her Olympic debut. Source: Getty / Morgan Hancock\n\nShe contacted a ski manufacturing company and offered her skills in marketing in exchange for skimo gear.\n\n\"I made that last something of two years before I broke it. But in saying that, that's a representation of how it's not that accessible, just because of how expensive the gear is,\" she said.\n\nThe high cost comes largely from the best equipment being made from carbon fibre, which keeps things extremely light for the athletes to climb and ski in, and store in their backpacks.\n\nA full skimo setup includes skis, boots, crampons, climbing skins, gloves, poles, helmet, backpack and avalanche gear and can cost up to around $10,000 for elite racers.\n\n\"You do have to make a lot of sacrifices, I guess, especially as an Australian coming into a very Eurocentric sport. It's a lot of travel, a lot of gear, things break easily, race suits, entry fees, coaching, all of it,\" Hamilton said.\n\nBellingham had a similar experience, also noting how expensive the sport is.\n\n\"It definitely wasn't easy, just because boots cost around $3,000,\" he told SBS.\n\n\"I had a ski supplier who gave me cross country skis when I was racing ... and I told them I was going to try and go to the Olympics for this different sport ski mountaineering and they helped me out with my first pair of skis.\"\n\nOlympians are paid $5,000 once they have qualified for each Games, and medal winners are paid up to $20,000 if they win gold. Athletes may be able to access other funds and have sponsors provide them with gear, but Hamilton is not the first Australian Winter Olympian to point out the high costs she's had to cover herself.\n\nAll geared up and ready to rise ... and descend\n\nBellingham spends his time chasing winters, spending time at Falls Creek in Australia and training overseas. Hamilton spends her summer competing in World Cup trail running circuits, and her northern hemisphere winters are spent in Europe or America.\n\nBoth are now in Italy ready for the ski mountaineering competition, which will be held from 19-21 February at the Stelvio Ski Centre in Bormio.\n\n\"It\u2019s really intense, which is awesome for the audience and a real challenge for athletes,\" Hamilton said.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Commonwealth, NAB and ANZ's increases will come into effect on 13 February, while Westpac's will come into effect on 17 February.\n\nAre there more hikes to come?\n\nANZ's head of Australian economics Adam Boyton said that with the RBA expecting higher inflation, lower GDP growth, higher medium-term unemployment and higher assumed interest rate path than previously thought, an additional rate hike appears likely.\n\nNAB chief economist Sally Auld said given the increasing pressures on inflation, it was unlikely to be a \"one-and-done\" scenario for the RBA.\n\n\"We continue to forecast a follow-up 25bp hike in May, although risks are biased to an earlier hike and the possibility of more than just a modest 50bp recalibration,\" she said.\n\nThe RBA board said it would use upcoming data about the global economy, domestic demand, inflation and the labour market to guide future decisions.\n\nThe big four banks have passed along the RBA's rate hike.

    "text": "Living a long, healthy life is sometimes framed as the outcome of daily choices, but a new study suggests genetics play a bigger role than previously thought.\n\nStandard advice for staying healthy longer includes exercising more, eating healthy food, having regular medical check-ups, sleeping well, drinking less alcohol and quitting smoking.\n\nBut new research by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel suggests, after removing deaths caused by external factors, genetics influence around 55 per cent of a person's lifespan.\n\nPublished in the journal Science, the new findings are based on mathematical modelling, drawing on more than a century of data from twins in Sweden and Denmark, countries with high living standards and relatively equal access to healthcare.\n\nThe authors of the new peer-reviewed research claim longevity genes can reveal ageing mechanisms and inform medicine. However, they point out the previous estimates of how much genetics influence life expectancy were confounded by external factors of mortality \u2014 accidents or infectious diseases \u2014 and therefore contributed to scepticism about the role of genetics in ageing.\n\nAccording to the researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science, most lifespan studies previously used data on cohorts of the population born in the 18th and 19th centuries, which were periods of high mortality caused by external factors.\n\nIn order to separate external factors from \"intrinsic\", mostly shaped by genetics, the researchers ran simulations of the two mortality models. They then tested their conclusions on three different twin studies.\n\nAs a result, they found, external mortality caused systematic underestimates of the link between genetics and longevity. While previous estimates put heritability at only 20 to 25 per cent, the new results showed genetics influence around 55 per cent of a person\u2019s lifespan.\n\n\"The study ... has important consequences for ageing research,\" wrote Daniela Bakula and Morten Scheibye-Knudsen, researchers at the University of Copenhagen, in a related Perspective article published in Science.\n\nThey said the findings give researchers good reason to identify genes linked to longer lives and to better understand the biological processes behind ageing.\n\nDr Jack da Silva, an evolution expert from the University of Adelaide, said the new study adds to previous research in lifespan heritability observed in other species.\n\n\"This is an impressively thorough study. We\u2019ve known for quite some time that there is a lot of genetic variation for lifespan in populations of organisms such as fruit flies studied in the laboratory, and that single genes can have a very large effect on lifespan in these organisms,\" De Silva said.\n\n\"The present study usefully shows that the same is true for humans. The study is also valuable in teasing out the effects of things that can kill us that aren\u2019t age-related, such as accidents and infections, which has been a difficult task in the past.\"\n\nContext dependent\n\nProfessor Tony Blakely, epidemiologist at the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health at the University of Melbourne, told SBS News the study was interesting, but \"not too surprising\".\n\n\"Because we know that you inherit risks for cancer. So for example, breast cancer has an inheritability, colorectal cancer has an inheritability, cardiovascular disease has some level of inheritability. So of course, therefore, some of the variation between us humans is going to be due to genetics.\"\n\nREAD MORE Should you be freaking out about microplastics?\n\nBlakely said variations in the environment can play a significant role.\n\n\"If you live in a place where half the people smoke, half the people don't, where there's really bad diets amongst some people, and really good diets amongst others, where half the population lives in really polluted cities, you've got more environmental variability. That will drive the overall variability of how long people are likely to live,\" he said.\n\nHe added that, in the Scandinavian countries that were studied, just like in Australia, some of the environmental determinants have been reduced.\n\n\"In Sweden or Denmark, and in Australia to a large extent, where we've reduced some of those environmental determinants or tried to squash them out. Then things like genes start to come out a little bit more as explaining some of the residual difference between humans and how long we might live.\"\n\nHowever, Blakely says countries such as Denmark or Sweden are more homogeneous than Australia, and longevity rates would be context-dependent.\n\n\"In a population like Australia with different countries of birth, different ethnicities, different socioeconomic groups, you might see more variability because the environment is causing more variability, not just genes causing how long you live.\"\n\nIn Australia, life expectancy has increased by over 30 years since 1900.\n\nBlakely says that this was not because genetics changed.\n\n\"That's because of improving diets, reduced smoking, better sanitation \u2014 all those things. And so what drives how long a population lives on average is the environment. But within wherever your population is, at some point in time, there will be variability in that due to genetics, as well as other variability that's due to things like whether you smoke or not.\"\n\nLife expectancy for females born between 2021-23 is now 85.1 years, and for males it's 81.1 years, according to figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.\n\nDo lifestyle choices influence longevity?\n\nBlakely said lifestyle choices, as well as access to quality health care, are critical to living longer.\n\n\"The quality of your diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sodium consumption, eating the fruit and vegetables, all that stuff still matters, and will be driving a lot of our own life expectancy.\"\n\nHe said it\u2019s not just about genetics and healthy habits. Sometimes it's also about luck.\n\n\"There's a certain amount of chance whether your gene is going to do a mutation and cause a cancer that's not inherited that happens as you get older,\" he said.\n\n\"So of course, lifestyle matters a lot. And so does the quality of our health services and treatments. We have treatments now that can save lives or prevent illness as well.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

I'm not in the market at the moment, and I'm probably won't be entering it for a long time.\"\n\nWOMAN 2: \"I believe in the future, our kids can't buy a house. It's going to be like a rental system, even if it's buying all their life they're going to pay it. They're not going to have life. Even if I'm working, they're saying, 125 or $160,000, how are you gonna repay the loan?\"\n\nThese women are responding to the interest rate rise announced by the independent Reserve Bank of Australia, bringing the cash rate up from 3.6 per cent to 3.85 per cent.\n\nIt's the first rate rise in over two years, making the RBA the second advanced economy central bank - behind Japan - to begin a new rate-rising cycle.\n\nDespite concerns that public spending fuelled inflation and crowded out the private sector, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a noisy session in parliament the Reserve Bank\u2019s report identifies private demand - not government spending - as the primary driver of inflation.\n\n\"It makes it very clear that the pressure on inflation is coming from private demand. Let me make this really clear. This is the Reserve Bank board in their statement just released. Mr Speaker, growth in private demand has strengthened substantially more than expected. Mr Speaker, this is the point that the Reserve Bank has made today.\"\n\nDr Chalmers says criticism of government spending and its role in driving up inflation is motivated by politics and not facts.\n\nWhile acknowledging that interest rates have risen further than the government hoped, Dr Chalmers is emphasising the urgent need to address inflation and productivity reform as global economic uncertainty intensifies.\n\nBecause the Reserve Bank raises rates specifically to curb inflation, the Treasurer took to ABC\u2019s Radio National Breakfast to defend the budget.\n\nAcknowledging the cost of living pressure Australians are facing, Dr Chalmers says the government is enacting policies to help ease daily pressures.\n\n\"Well, first of all, more than acknowledge that people are still under pressure, we're acting on that. Cheaper medicines, which came out last month, more bulk billing, student debt relief, three tax cuts: that's all about acknowledging and acting on the very real pressures that people are feeling in our community and around our country.\"\n\nDespite the Reserve Bank statement , Opposition leader Sussan Ley insists government spending is responsible for the inflation problem.\n\n\"Australians are struggling even more with the cost of living crisis. This is Labor's cost of living crisis. When labor spends, prices rise and Australians pay. And I've been speaking to a lot of mums, and I know my colleagues have and as they look at the expenses of going back to school last week and this week, and they're staring straight down the barrel of possibly more interest rate rises.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Leader of the Greens party, Larissa Waters, blames Australia's speculative housing market for the inflation problem.\n\n\"We know the reason the housing market is overheated is the policies of this government to prop up property investment and to give billions of dollars to property investors, rather than helping first home owners and renters. Those are the policy settings that the government should have fixed. But instead, the government is delivering for the big banks, just like they deliver for their big corporate mates all the time.\"\n\nDr Tim Thornton, the director of the school of political economy, says the level of government spending as a percentage of GDP is not particularly large in Australia by OECD standards.\n\nHe says raising interest rates is not the only lever available to rein in inflation.\n\n\"Well, there are actually a range of other tools that can be used to manage inflation, beyond simply lifting interest rates. Most but not all of these would be the responsibility of the government rather than the Reserve Bank of Australia. These tools include price controls, credit controls, rationing, establishing buffer stocks, and also what are called income policies, which are political agreements between different stakeholders in society. Now it's currently the intellectual fashion to vehemently dismiss these other tools as being somehow outdated or even discredited. I think this is quite the mistake, as all of these tools have been used successfully in Australia in the past, and at least some of these could be used again and in the future.\"\n\nMeanwhile Dr Andrew Grant, Associate Professor of Finance at the University of Sydney, warns there could be more rises.\n\n\"Typically, when the Reserve Bank increases rates, they don't typically stop at one increase. Historically, it's sort of been a sign that they might be two or three in a row. We typically have seen that there's a bit of momentum in these things. So I wouldn't be surprised at all if, you know, we get another rate increase before the end of the year, or even before half be the end of the financial year, especially if this sort of struggles to put a brake on inflation. So that's what I will expect to see.\"",

And we don't just acknowledge that, we're acting on that as a government collectively. We're acting on that with cheaper medicines and tax cuts, more bulk billing, student debt relief and the like. Now if those opposite really cared about the pressure on people around this country, they would have supported that cost of living help.\"\n\n---\n\nFormer Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has joined Pauline Hanson's One Nation party.\n\nHe is the latest former Coalition member to join her party following Barnaby Joyce's defection from the Nationals in December.\n\nMr Bernardi is running as a candidate for One Nation at the South Australian election next month.\n\nHe says he has been having conversations with Ms Hanson over a number of years, after he quit the federal Senate in 2020.\n\n\"There is no doubt that I will stay a member of One Nation. Pauline and my views are aligned. And quite frankly if you look at history, we were both members of the Liberal Party at one point. Pauline has been trying to reshape politics for 30 years. I thought I could reshape politics as well by dragging parties back to where they should be. They don't want that. But right now Pauline Hanson has legacy that is worth defending and is worth building upon.\"\n\n---\n\nThe protest restrictions in New South Wales have been extended ahead of a planned visit of Israel's president.\n\nNationwide protests have been planned against the visit by President Isaac Herzog, who has been invited to visit Australia after the Bondi terror attack in December.\n\nThe New South Wales Police Commissioner, Mal Lanyon, has declared the restrictions on applications for approval for public assemblies will be in effect for the next 14 days.\n\nIt will apply to the region covered by the Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command; and in parts of Sydney\u2019s CBD, excluding Hyde Park.\n\nPremier Chris Minns says a balance must be struck.\n\n\"There\u2019s a need to protect both the president, who is an invited guest of Australia, and also regular Australians as they go about their jobs and lives in Sydney next week. And we want to make sure we\u2019re balancing those protections.\"\n\n---\n\nVictoria's government has announced it's allowing general practitioners to diagnose and treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD in adults and children.\n\nAdults in the state can currently only be diagnosed and prescribed medication by a psychiatrist, and children must see a paediatrician or psychiatrist.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan says that is leading to high out-of-pocket costs and long wait times.\n\n\"Too many families are waiting too long. It can take months for some and up to more than a year to receive that first diagnosis and then that repeat visit to get the scripts refilled adds stress as well for these families. But also too it puts additional pressure on our specialists in the system - our paediatricians and our psychiatrists.\"\n\nThe change will be supported with $750,000 allocated to accredited training for an initial 150 GPs by September this year to diagnose and treat ADHD in adults and children.\n\n---\n\nTo sport,\n\nThe Wallabies will kick off the 2027 Rugby World Cup against Hong Kong in Perth on October 1st.\n\nThe tournament is being held in Australia for the first time since 2003.\n\nThe Wallabies second match will be against the All Blacks in Sydney on October 9, followed by a game against Chile on October 16 in Brisbane.\n\nThe expanded 24-team World Cup will feature 52 matches across 19 match days in seven cities - with a shortened pool stage but a new knockout round of 16.",

I'm Biwa Kwan.\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley has offered to reunite the Coalition this week on the condiiton that the three senators who crossed the floor on hate speech laws remain on the backbench for six months.\n\nMs Ley described conversations with Nationals leader David Littleproud last night as 'constructive' - a fortnight after the Nationals announced an end to the Coalition arrangement with the Liberal Party.\n\nMs Ley says she feels confident about progressing talks with the Nationals.\n\n\"We had constructive conversations with the national party last night, but I want to make a point that they were they were constructive. We agreed to keep doing that because we are both parties on the non Labor side of politics.\"\n\n---\n\nTeachers and principals in New South Wales who engage in hate speech could be fired under new rules for school staff.\n\nThe state government says the policy change applies from today.\n\nThe changes affect the code of conduct for staff across government, independent and Catholic schools - giving the regulator the power to direct a school to fire a staff member in the event of a breach.\n\nPremier Chris Minns says it follows cases where prominent teachers or principals have been accused of hate speech, but the government felt it could not take action.\n\nDeputy Premier Prue Car says the change is needed.\n\n\"This is a common sense change. The vast majority of schools this will never apply to. But it is important that the government sends a message to parents of New South Wales that schools should always be safe places. And in order for those to be as safe as possible, we will crack down on hate speech in schools and the community.\"\n\n---\n\nThe United Nations has welcomed the re-opening of the Rafah crossing into Gaza from Egypt, but appealed for an increase in the number of people allowed to cross the border.\n\nThe reopening marked a key step in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire process but a mostly symbolic one, as few people will be allowed to travel in either direction and no goods will pass through.\n\nGaza health officials say there are around 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care who hope to leave the devastated territory via the crossing.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric wants the restrictions at the border to be lifted further.\n\n\"As we have said before, civilians must be allowed to leave and return voluntarily and safely, as international law requires ultimately, essential humanitarian supplies must enter in sufficient quantities and with fewer restrictions through Rafah and all other crossings.\"\n\n---\n\nThe United States Justice Department says it's taken down several thousand documents and media relating to its Epstein investigation that may have inadvertently included victim-identifying information.\n\nIt blamed the release of sensitive information on 'technical or human error'.\n\nThe effect of errors in the documents was highlighted on Monday [[2 Feb US time]] at a sex trafficking trial in New York federal court.\n\nThe lawyers for two high-end real estate brokers and their brother had asked Judge Valerie Caproni for a mistrial because of documents that were made public without necessary redactions.\n\n---\n\nIn tennis,\n\nTwo mothers feature inside the Top 10 for the first time in rankings history.\n\nBelinda Bencic and Elina Svitolina are the fifth and sixth players to be ranked inside the Top 10 as mothers, following Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Kim Clijsters nd Serena Williams.\n\nBencic says she is proud of the achievement.\n\n\"That means of course a lot to me. Making the top 10 means a lot to me. I am super proud of this achievement, but I think mainly I have to thank my support team - my family for helping me so much; to make this possible for me to do what I'm doing. To travel around the world and still play tennis. I think without them, I wouldn't be able to do that. And in general, I am just super happy. And also thanks so much for the fans for the support.\"\n\nUnder rules introduced from 2019, new mothers returning to the tour are able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period from the birth of their child.\n\nAnd that's SBS News in Easy English.

Raucously popular for almost 150 years, a good Pirates is still a guaranteed money-spinner. This staging, originally by Opera Australia, has been met with laughter and acclaim wherever she sails. Victorian Opera is now at the helm, but audience reaction will be no different. Ben Mingay as The Pirate King. Jeff Busby With comedic plots of clever rhymes sung at rapid-fire pace to catchy melodies, Gilbert & Sullivan is a style unto itself. Pirates is the most joyous piece in the G&S canon, with innumerable proliferations across popular culture, including perhaps the most parodied song in the English language, I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General. VO artistic director Stuart Maunder has fashioned this production with a lifetime\u2019s worth of devoted insight. There\u2019s thought behind the tiniest details; he has squeezed as much funny out as is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Mingay\u2019s much-lauded Pirate King is charismatic and wonderfully riotous, always scene-stealing. He gels naturally with Nicholas Jones, a VCA graduate turned Paris Opera principal artist, as Frederic. Jones deploys his full bag of tricks for this role: effortless operatic tenor, impeccable comedic timing, notably un-wussy sword fighting, even some ballet. Opposite him are emerging and seasoned opera darlings (respectively) Nina Korbe and Antoinette Halloran. Korbe\u2019s coloratura hits every mark perfectly, and while Halloran\u2019s cockney Ruth might conjure up her recent turn as Mrs Lovett, she\u2019s reliably excellent, as is tenor Douglas Kelly as the pirate Samuel. This is just about the best version of Pirates of Penzance you can see. Jeff Busby Stage stalwart Richard Piper (Major-General Stanley) appears more at home with comedy than music. He somehow, on opening night, managed to get ahead of the orchestra during his famous number, though he still landed the laughs. Conductor James Pratt does an otherwise superb job of keeping everyone and everything together, bringing requisite buoyancy to Orchestra Victoria\u2019s playing of the score. One omission sorely missed is surtitles. Though sung in English, diction in the chorus numbers tended towards unintelligibility. Any real pitfalls are those present in the work itself (and some are very dated). With that in mind, is this production just about the best version of Pirates that you could see? Aye aye!\n\nReviewed by Bridget Davies\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMUSIC\n\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAlexandra Gardens, January 30 Across his decades-long career, Nick Cave\u2019s work has always courted darkness: his lyrics reverberate with images of biblical violence, with the ache of loneliness and grief, with the kind of love that goes hand in hand with death. Yet equally, he is attuned to beauty and salvation; to the distant, longed-for possibility of redemption. It is in the tension between these two impulses, never quite reconciled, that the strength of his artistry lies. Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds at Alexandra Gardens on Friday. Richard Clifford This artistry was on full display at Melbourne\u2019s Alexandra Gardens, where an electrifying 2\u00bd-hour set somehow didn\u2019t seem long enough. It\u2019s been nine years since Cave last toured with the full complement of the Bad Seeds, and the band seems determined to make up for lost time. Every person on stage comes to the performance with absolute conviction: from Warren Ellis working his unruly magic with the violin, to the gorgeous textures of the gospel-inflected backing choir, and the magnetic, visceral energy of Cave himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve been on a great odyssey across this country to get to Melbourne,\u201d he says, to roars of approval. This is a show for the home crowd. The set deftly balances work from the band\u2019s 2024 album, Wild God, with cherry-picked tracks from its extensive back catalogue. An early highlight is a searching performance of O Children from the 2004 album, Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus, while Cave\u2019s darker impulses are on full display in the seductively menacing groove of Red Right Hand and the apocalyptic bombast of The Mercy Seat. Nick Cave\u2019s artistry was on full display at Melbourne\u2019s Alexandra Gardens, where an electrifying 2\u00bd-hour set somehow doesn\u2019t seem long enough Richard Clifford While the show contains its moments of pain, rage and despair, these days, joy is perhaps Cave\u2019s primary register. It\u2019s there in the naive lyrics of Frogs, in his open-hearted tribute to former bandmate and collaborator Anita Lane in O Wow O Wow (How Wonderful She Is), and most defiantly in Joy, in which Cave conjures up a ghostly child visitor with a message of hope amid the tragedy of the everyday: \u201cWe\u2019ve all had too much sorrow, now is the time for joy.\u201d A generous, six-song encore showcases some of the band\u2019s best work: from an elemental rendition of The Weeping Song to a sensitive cover of Young Charlatans\u2019 Shiver (perhaps the world\u2019s most accomplished love song ever to have been written by a 16-year-old). A luminous performance of Into My Arms brings the evening to a close: tender, plainspoken, the darkness tempered always by light.\n\nReviewed by Nadia Bailey\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDANCE\n\nMIDSUMMA | Garabari \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMeat Market, North Melbourne, until January 31 Garabari is billed as a participatory event, so there\u2019s no excuse for not playing along. Forewarned is fair warning: you\u2019ve bought a ticket, so you\u2019ve got to help out. It\u2019s not going to work if you don\u2019t bring your dancing shoes. Garabari at Midsumma Festival fits the community mood and travels well. Courtesy of Sydney Festival Yes, at first, it\u2019s awkward. People meander through the large, dark space, drifting aimlessly and smiling apologetically. The soundscape is a disconcerting mix of creakings and scrapings. We\u2019re warming up to the room and to each other. Of course, it\u2019s all part of a larger narrative. We\u2019re already inside a re-visioning of the story of the Murrumbidgee River\u2019s creation. This first part is a time of drought, we\u2019re told, a time of dust and heat and general suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe performers circulate through the crowd and little dances begin to appear: fragmentary routines for two or three or four. Crowds gather and disperse. It\u2019s as if something is bubbling away, building up. Eventually, there\u2019s a short but effective narrative dance showing the liberation of the waters by the youngest and bravest of the goanna women. Huge shadows loom against a curtain as the earth cracks open and land is quenched. After that, the party begins in earnest. Everyone has to dance. The performers keep it moving, calling people in, co-ordinating mass choreography, whooping and hollering and carrying on. It\u2019s diverting \u2013 even if it feels a little forced. It almost recalls the compulsory jollity of cruise ship entertainment or theatre for children, with the performers policing participation, albeit with endless grinning and an ultimately tolerant attitude to refusal. As a celebration of the stories and rituals from the Wiradjuri community around Wagga Wagga and the Riverina, where the show was developed, Garabari is enjoyable, for all its goofiness and happy-clappy enthusiasm. It\u2019s a fun homage to the institution of corroboree. Whether it becomes anything like a true rite of passage, leaving participants altered, is another question. That\u2019s a tall order for such a brief performance \u2013 little over an hour. But at Midsumma Festival, it fits the community mood and travels well.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJAZZ\n\nThe Necks \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, January 29 At first glance, the three members of The Necks are mere musicians. But Chris Abrahams, Lloyd Swanton and Tony Buck are also magicians. How else to explain the way they pull invisible threads of sound from the ether and fashion them \u2013 instinctively, intuitively and moment-by-moment \u2013 into perfectly formed musical tales? The Necks - Lloyd Swanton, Tony Buck and Chris Abrahams. Camille Walsh Photography Now in their 39th year together, the trio has developed the kind of creative communion that makes each fully improvised journey feel both thrillingly unpredictable and somehow inevitable. Thursday night marked the start of the band\u2019s annual Australian tour, and an air of hushed anticipation greeted the trio\u2019s arrival on stage. Sparsely lit and heads bowed, they waited in silence. When Swanton began plucking his bass \u2013 slowly, deliberately \u2013 it felt more like a prayer than a series of notes. Buck\u2019s touch on cymbals was equally spare and reverential, as was Abrahams\u2019 glistening piano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfinitesimal variations in tone and texture were explored, drawing us deep into this meditative realm as the mood gradually darkened. Related Article Melbourne live reviews Even this pop star thinks having her gig at the tennis is a bit weird Swanton\u2019s bass morphed into an insistent buzz, its vibrations merging with Abrahams\u2019 open-pedal piano clusters and Buck\u2019s briskly whisked cymbals. Tranquility gave way to tension, the blood-red stage lights echoing the sense of high drama that was as menacing as it was enthralling. The second set opened in a pool of limpid beauty: exquisitely lyrical piano motifs, reverberant bass and lightly padding toms. Serene, drifting, lovely. Again, the music beckoned and disarmed us, luring us in as the restful sway turned into a more full-bodied swell and then a churning sea. This time, the roiling waves seemed majestic rather than forbidding. Perhaps by now we\u2019d surrendered \u2013 no longer caught in the current but letting ourselves be swept along by it, just as the musicians were. Buck\u2019s torso rocked back and forth, embodying the restless energy that coursed through the music. Agitation and abstraction; hallucinatory spirals of sound; and then, as if by magic, the waves subsided and we found ourselves gently carried back to shore.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHEATRE\n\nThe Placeholder \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until February 8 The shared experience of grief has culminated in many an incisive theatre piece centred on chosen families navigating existential questions of loss, friendship and mortality \u2013 Domenica Feraud\u2019s off-Broadway play Someone Spectacular and, closer to home, Ash Flanders\u2019 Malthouse production This Is Living among them.

Helen (Michelle Perera) is a widow with a heart of gold and a penchant for baking. A proud lesbian, Keira (Rebecca Bower) self-medicates with alcohol to withstand living in a cloistered town. Barb\u2019s niece Jo (Brigid Gallacher) is the conservative black sheep of the group. And sporty Nic (Oliver Ayres) used to go by Nicole, until they announce they\u2019re transitioning into a man. The reprisal is swift. The elder members of the group, Pat and Helen, paradoxically take it in their stride, but Keira is incensed by the perceived loss of a lesbian peer, and Jo insists it\u2019s all just a phase. The remainder of the play details the fallout of Nic continuously insisting on his personhood against bad-faith arguments and a gulf of miscomprehensions. As the kindest, most level-headed character, Helen is who most audiences will project themselves onto. But Perera, so brilliant in This Is Living, is also the strongest of the ensemble. Her comedic timing is impeccable as she expertly oscillates between empathetic displays of allyship and perfectly executed moments of humour that imbue the play with levity at key junctures.

But it\u2019s Keira\u2019s see-sawing between solidarity and gender essentialism and a self-victimisation that\u2019s impervious to the marginalisation of others that\u2019s harder to stomach \u2013 and altogether more interesting. MacEllen presents thought-provoking contrasts between desired gender-affirming care and unwanted life-saving surgery, gender and sexuality, mental deterioration and newly prized lucidity.

Think of all those comments about Heated Rivalry clogging up your feed. It can\u2019t be only gay and bisexual men who were aroused by raunchy encounters between closeted hockey players in the show, or it wouldn\u2019t have been such a huge phenomenon. In fact, women consume almost half of all gay male porn on Porn Hub, and as we enter an age of increasing heteropessimism, it seems homoeroticism has become flavour of the month. Matthew Mitcham (left) and Matthew Predny in a scene from Afterglow. Cameron Grant That\u2019s good news for S. Asher Gelman\u2019s Afterglow. The play bears the tagline \u201cthe climax is just the beginning\u201d, and true to its word, starts in flagrante, with a gay male threesome nuzzling and pashing each other, post-coitally entwined. If you\u2019re jonesing for a Heated Rivalry fix in the flesh, look no further. The show comes fully stocked in the eye candy department, with liberal displays of full-frontal male nudity (the most I have seen onstage since Puppetry of the Penis).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three actors are intimidatingly hot and ripped. Gym-toned physiques. Washboard abs. Bubble butts. And the characters are unabashedly sexual, with tastefully choreographed erotica underpinning Gelman\u2019s relationship drama. Scientist Alex (Julian Curtis) and his theatre director husband, Josh (Matthew Mitcham \u2013 yes, the Olympic gold medallist), are a Manhattan gay couple in an open marriage. Afterglow is non-judgmental about the various forms contemporary relationships may take. Cameron Grant They seem to have it all. They\u2019re handsome, successful and loaded \u2013 and they have a commitment to starting a family together, expecting their first child via surrogacy in a few months.

Josh fails to inform his husband of a crucial detail, while seeking to avoid confronting marital difficulties or disappointments in his newfound passion for Darius. Darius genuinely falls for Josh and is torn between desire for what he cannot have and appal that the love triangle he\u2019s entered is causing unintended distress. Related Article Lunch with \u2018Nourishes my soul\u2019: The side gig Matthew Mitcham swears by The set is modular genius that\u2019d put IKEA designers to shame (and allows for steamy shower scenes). And the performances are strong and likeable, lending a charismatic gloss to the unfolding melodrama, even if the underlying emotional dynamics aren\u2019t always fully and precisely articulated. As an examination of modern polyamory, the play is a touch predictable and superficial for my taste. Yet it does have the advantage of being broadly relatable \u2013 whether you\u2019re gay or straight or something in between \u2013 and remains non-judgmental about the various forms contemporary relationships may take.

His emotional intensity and poetical abundance feel almost radical in the world of contemporary concert dance. He\u2019s a proper phenomenon and still very much in the prime of his career. Aakash Odedra performs in Songs of the Bulbul Angela Grabowska For Songs of the Bulbul he has teamed up with choreographer Rani Khanam to make an hour-long solo from the Sufi myth of the caged nightingale or bulbul. The more the bird suffers, goes the story, the more beautiful its song. The result is a tour de force: a moody, mettled drama that slips between plain statement and lyric suggestion. It is yearning and inward but with plenty of athletic excitement in the combination of rapid Kathak footwork and the loosened spinning of the Sufi dervishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the beginning, Odedra ranges freely across the stage, buoyant and smiling, skirts flaring into blurred halos, bare feet snapping lightly at the floor. Birdlike figurations, with quicksilver movements of head and hand, connect cleanly with happy leaps and turns. Related Article Melbourne live reviews This is about the best version of Pirates of Penzance you could see The pathways of movement become narrower as the cage descends. The bird strains against captivity, projecting anguish: arms reach upward, palms open, sometimes pleading, sometimes offering. The light begins to dwindle and flicker as Odedra collapses, clutching at the red confetti that swirls around him. The soundtrack, by composer Rushil Ranjan, is epic: thunderous percussion, tinkling music-box phrases, blanketing strings and soaring arias. Select UK performances reportedly featured a full live arrangement. One can only imagine the immersive force of such an event. Here, pre-recorded, the intensity is still formidable. Indeed, sometimes, with the strings building and building and building, it all becomes too much, too busy, too alarming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the show\u2019s climax the bird has its eyes removed. This moment is staged with clarity and admirable restraint. It\u2019s the quietest passage, wisely, and therefore the most concentrated. The tragedy lands with the barest ornament, its awful resonance unimpeded. Coming down from that is hard. The closing scenes, for me, fall into something a little too gimmicky: standing before a bank of electric candles, Odedra gestures here and there, lighting the lights and dousing them as if by the magic of the suffering he has just passed through. Still, in Melbourne right now there are few chances to see an international touring dance artist at all, let alone one of this calibre, moving across traditions with such total imaginative surrender and generosity of feeling.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

Such giants have been hampered by worries that their stock prices shot too high and became too expensive following their years-long dominance of the market. Stocks of software companies and others seen as potential losers to competitors powered by artificial intelligence also slumped. ServiceNow fell 7 per cent to bring its loss for the young year so far to 28.3 per cent. Such declines dragged the S&P 500 to its fourth loss in the last five days, even though the majority of stocks in the index rose.

Got it Share A A A\n\nStrickland Metals has lit up its Serbian Rogozna project with a fresh high-grade gold-copper discovery, immediately loading the war chest with a $55 million capital raise to accelerate drilling and development studies. The one-two punch signals a clear shift from discovery mode to development intent, with drilling success now matched by the funding firepower to accelerate growth. Core from Strickland Metals\u2019 Red Creek discovery at Rogozna in Serbia showing massive chalcopyrite mineralisation in contact with carbonate. The discovery was made at the Red Creek prospect, about 1km west of the company\u2019s 5.3-million-ounce gold equivalent Shanac deposit. Initial drilling has intersected both shallow epithermal gold mineralisation and deeper skarn-hosted gold and base metals zones - a geological mix that mirrors other major deposits across the Rogozna system. The standout discovery hole delivered numerous zones of mineralisation, including a solid 4.0 metres running at an impressive 4.0 grams per tonne (g/t) gold equivalent from 44.0m and a deeper interval of 53.0m at 2.3g/t gold equivalent from 514.4m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin that deeper 53m zone, the drill bit threw up a 35-metre wide, higher-grade core, running 3.1g/t gold equivalent, including a thick 4.4-metre slice at a stellar 8.9g/t gold equivalent at 522.0m, followed by another hefty 5.8-metre interval grading 4.5g/t gold equivalent from 536.7m. Importantly, Red Creek sits on the same structure that hosts the Copper Canyon deposit, about 1.5km along strike, opening up a new corridor of exploration ground between Copper Canyon and Shanac that has seen little drilling to date. Mineralisation at Red Creek remains open along strike and at depth, with assays pending from several additional holes. Strickland managing director Paul L\u2019Herpiniere said: \u201cOur world-class team in Serbia have done it again, with exploration drilling at Red Creek, just 1km from our cornerstone Shanac Deposit, delivering a new high-grade discovery. This is an exciting development which reinforces the highly endowed nature of the mineral system at Rogozna and offers an exciting new focal point for resource growth.\u201d Hot on the heels of the discovery, Strickland moved to lock in funding, announcing a $55m institutional placement priced at 16 cents per share. The raise will fund an additional 70,000m of drilling across Rogozna in 2026 and support delivery of a pre-feasibility study targeted for the first half of 2027. Backing the story is some heavyweight support. Global mining major Zijin Mining Group has committed $5m to the placement, lifting its stake in Strickland to four per cent. The endorsement from one of the world\u2019s largest copper and gold producers adds serious credibility to Rogozna\u2019s development pathway and underlines the project\u2019s strategic appeal as drilling success continues to stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrickland\u2019s $55 million funding package will bankroll one of the most aggressive exploration campaigns ever mounted in the Balkans, with a massive 70,000m drilling program planned across Rogozna through this year. The drilling will serve the dual purpose of tightening up and upgrading resources at Shanac, Gradina and Copper Canyon, while simultaneously chasing growth at the new Red Creek discovery and testing fresh targets across the broader system. Crucially, the scale and structure of the program are designed to fast-track Rogozna towards development, feeding directly into an internal scoping study in the first half of this year and a full pre-feasibility study targeted for the first half of 2027. This will deliver Strickland\u2019s first detailed economic picture of Rogozna, including costs, production profiles and project returns - the kind of milestone that typically unlocks institutional backing and strategic interest, provided the geology stacks up. With gold running hot, copper tightening and a $55m war chest locked in, Strickland now has both the discoveries and the firepower to push Rogozna hard.

Got it Share A A A\n\nA dramatic sale of 35,000 hectares of defence real estate \u2013 including some of the nation\u2019s most historic barracks \u2013 is expected to raise almost $2 billion to be ploughed back into new military equipment and upgrades to essential bases. Islands, golf courses, rifle ranges, office buildings and training depots across the country will be sold under the Albanese government\u2019s long-awaited response to a sweeping audit of the nation\u2019s defence estate portfolio. Defence Minister Richard Marles and Assistant Defence Minister Peter Khalil announce the major sale of Defence property. Dominic Lorrimer The government has decided to stare down opposition to sell-offs from the military establishment, which has jealously guarded its access to prized sites. The release of the government\u2019s response to the audit has been delayed by over two years as it braces for blowback from veterans and local communities to the sale of some of the country\u2019s most iconic defence facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis masthead revealed on Wednesday that the Victoria Barracks sites in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane will be sold, opening up the possibility of housing developments in inner-city areas. Defence Minister Richard Marles said the government was undertaking the \u201cmost significant reform to Australia\u2019s defence estate in our nation\u2019s history\u201d. \u201cThe heritage value of these properties does not belong to the Australian Army or, for that matter, the Australian Defence Force. It belongs to the Australian people,\u201d Marles said. \u201cAnd right now, the Australian people are prevented from seeing these properties, they exist behind a defence wall.\u201d Acknowledging the long delay between receiving the audit and releasing a response, Marles said: \u201cIt has taken time because it has been difficult. This is a challenging issue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Exclusive\n\nDefence Historic buildings, prime real estate: Defence ready to sell off Victoria Barracks in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane Sixty-seven defence sites will be fully or partially sold \u2013 including the birthplace of the Royal Australian Air Force in Victoria and the army\u2019s headquarters in Sydney \u2013 by the Department of Finance, with an estimated sale price of $3 billion. Relocating staff and remediation works ahead of sale could cost as much as $1.2 billion, meaning net proceeds of up to $1.8 billion are expected from the divestments. The government also expects to save $100 million a year by reducing maintenance costs. All the money raised from the sales, which are expected to take years to complete, will be reinvested into defence. Asked about the scope to expand the supply of housing by selling defence sites, Marles said: \u201cI expect that housing will be part of the opportunity that is created here, but I want to be really clear: that\u2019s not why we\u2019re doing this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is around making sure we have a defence estate which is properly attuned to the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force, and that we are not wasting money on property which gives no capability benefit.\u201d Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said the asset sales would be decided on a case-by-case basis. \u201cI mean, there are some prime locations. I imagine there will be a lot of interest and a lot of views about what it can be used for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful some of that would be for housing, but it really is to be determined, and no decisions have been made.\u201d Assistant Defence Minister Peter Khalil said he was shocked to recently visit a vacant training depot in Penrith, in western Sydney, which had cost $1 million over six years to maintain but was strewn with rubbish and covered in graffiti.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, he said, some salubrious facilities \u201chave grass tennis courts that rival Wimbledon, manicured lawns, sprawling golf courses, but they are also not meeting the operational and capability requirements for our ADF\u201d. The audit, conducted by former Defence Housing Australia managing director Jan Mason and Infrastructure Victoria chair Jim Miller, found the defence estate is riddled with waste and that tough decisions are required to ensure taxpayer money is being spent wisely. \u201cIt is very clear and widely acknowledged that Defence does not need and cannot afford all of the current estate,\u201d Mason and Miller wrote in their audit report, delivered to the government in December 2023. \u201cUnderutilised portions of the Defence estate are draining resources from higher priority needs. Sustainment budgets as they relate to this part of the estate are stretched too thinly, resulting in critical failures and costly unscheduled repairs.\u201d The auditors acknowledged that their recommendations \u201care likely to evoke strong emotions associated with its history, scale and diversity\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA government source, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said taxpayers had been \u201cpissing money up against a wall and it needs to stop\u201d. In NSW, the sites to be sold include: Victoria Barracks, Paddington\n\nLancer Barracks, Parramatta\n\nHMAS Penguin (partial sale)\n\nRandwick Barracks (partial sale)\n\nRAAF Glenbrook\n\nSpectacle Island\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Victoria, the sites include: Latchford Barracks\n\nNewland Barracks\n\nRAAF Williams, Point Cook\n\nRAAF Williams, Laverton (partial)\n\nDefence site Maribyrnong\n\nVictoria Barracks In Queensland, the sites include: St Lucia Training Depot\n\nMount Isa Rifle Range\n\nVictoria Barracks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Western Australia, the sites include: Irwin Barracks\n\nLeeuwin Barracks More to come.

Once widespread throughout white-collar workforces in the mid-20th century, only the most senior staff at KPMG will retain Australian-based executive assistants after the planned transition, representing about a fifth of the number it once employed here. Executive assistant jobs have been cut in Australia and sent offshore by KPMG. Eamon Gallagher Under the proposal leaked to corporate gossip Instagram page The Aussie Corporate, there would be a phased approach, with 100 roles shunted from Australia to the Philippines in April and a further 100 across May and June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost-cutting measure, also aimed at improving consistency of service across the business, comes as demand for consulting services has dropped off among the big-four consulting firms. In the year to June 2025, KPMG reported revenue of $2.3 billion: slightly lower than the previous year, while remuneration for its partners grew 10.3 per cent. Nicole Gorton, executive recruitment director at recruitment agency Robert Half, said offshoring can be successful in some cases where work is highly repetitive. \u201cWhere it\u2019s very administrative task heavy, such as triaging emails or formatting documents and entering data, that\u2019s when we\u2019re seeing [these jobs] be offshored,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where organisations see that they can have cost benefit by offshoring.\u201d However, Gorton said it is more difficult for organisations where the assistant is involved in strategy, execution, decision-making and stakeholder engagement. \u201cThese responsibilities require deep knowledge of the business and local stakeholder understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThe EA role has evolved to being a strategic partner who often has input in conversations and decisions. Proximity matters in these cases, and EAs are often the glue to the business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGorton said offshoring tends to be cyclical, but that she has seen an increasing number of jobs being outsourced over the past decade. \u201cA company might do an offshoring project that will be sustainable for a period of time, and then the people in the weeds of managing the offshoring relationships have challenges,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cBut most definitely, offshoring has been happening at a larger scale.\u201d Job ad data from employment marketplace Seek shows personal assistant, executive assistant and secretarial roles have been declining steadily for the past few years. As of December, these roles declined 18 per cent over the year, while wider administration and office support industry roles fell 7 per cent over the same time period and job ads more widely dropped 4 per cent. KPMG Australia last year conducted its own analysis of the fastest growing jobs and those \u201cgoing extinct\u201d, noting some occupational groups had seen sharp declines in workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe number of executive assistants fell by more than 20 per cent to 82,300 over the past decade due to the automation of administrative functions through smartphones and apps,\u201d it said. While roughly 65 of KPMG\u2019s EA roles would remain in Australia, the scope of services covered by every role will change with updated position descriptions.

A spokeswoman for KMPG said consultation with its people was ongoing as the firm moved away from the practice of doing everything in-house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are continually evolving the way we work to build a scalable, modern, resilient business that positions us for growth and competitiveness,\u201d she said.

Got it Share A A A\n\nLast year, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI artificial intelligence start-up bailed out investors in X, his social media platform. Then Musk\u2019s Tesla pumped $US2 billion ($2.85 billion) into xAI, which was burning more than $US1 billion of cash a month. Now he\u2019s caused SpaceX to merge with xAI in a deal valuing the combined businesses at $US1.25 trillion ($1.8 trillion). See the pattern? As one of the companies he controls needs cash, he turns to another that has it. When that proves insufficient, he has looked to one of the two most valuable companies within his orbit \u2013 one without the approvals and governance complexities of Tesla \u2013 to bail them out. Elon Musk is known for his outlandish plans. AP There was speculation that it would be Tesla that would acquire xAI but, while Tesla has about $US44 billion of cash in its balance sheet, the switch of focus from producing electric vehicles to robotaxis and robots that Musk revealed last month and the cashflow-negative impact of the $US20 billion investment that entails probably ruled it out, at least this time. SpaceX planned a float this year, with a mooted valuation of about $US800 billion, which would raise about $US50 billion of cash from new investors. Some of that cash will now be available to xAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe merged group\u2019s valuation of $US1.2 trillion represents a big lift from the most recent valuations of its components as, just over a year ago, the merged xAI and X was deemed to have an equity value of about $US113 billion and a $US20 billion capital raising last month was struck at a valuation of $US230 billion. Related Article Opinion\n\nAI Robots, redundancies and runaway spending: Not all AI hits the mark Elizabeth Knight Business columnist For the purposes of the merger, xAI is now valued at $US250 billion, while SpaceX\u2019s value has jumped to $US1 trillion and there\u2019s talk of the IPO producing a $US1.5 trillion valuation. The numbers, and their escalation, are mind-blowing, but so are artificial intelligence\u2019s appetite for capital and Musk\u2019s visions. xAI is one of the minnows competing with giants in the hugely capital-intensive race to stake out a position in AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere giants like Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have torrents of cashflow from their legacy businesses to fund the hundreds of billions of dollars they are ploughing into AI \u2013 and even they are now having to raise external debt because of the scale of the spending on training large language models and building data centres \u2013 start-ups like xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic are reliant on seemingly endless rounds of equity raisings (and, increasingly, debt issues) at ever-greater valuations. The sector\u2019s insatiable appetite for capital has outstripped the capacity or willingness of equity markets to supply it, hence the increasing levels of debt in the sector and the incestuous deals between its participants. Musk himself said the rationale for the merger was that, within two or three years, the least expensive way to do AI computations would be in space. AP On some estimates, the four or five heavyweight players in the sector will spend about $US500 billion over the next three years. It wouldn\u2019t surprise if it were significantly more. This is an extraordinary period of highly focused and extraordinarily capital-intensive industry development. At some point, perhaps quite soon, there\u2019ll be either a consolidation of the sector or a wipeout of its weaker players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA puncturing of the ever-inflating, and arguably already highly inflated, valuations would force rationalisation (and cause a lot of pain for the companies and their investors and lenders) if the equity spigot were turned off. Related Article Analysis\n\nAI \u2018Absolute nightmare\u2019: The social network where AI chatbots exchange ideas and gossip about humans With the enlarged SpaceX not the only big AI-tinged float planned for this year \u2013 OpenAI and Anthropic have theirs on drawing boards \u2013 the market\u2019s willingness to continue to support financial models that involve massive outlays today for uncertain returns in three, four or five years\u2019 time will be stress-tested. That\u2019s why, as was the case when xAI was used to bailout investors in X (who were badly underwater on their investments), Musk has turned to SpaceX and its ability to raise a very big lump of cash \u2013 at $US50 billion, an IPO equity raising would be the biggest in history, dwarfing the $US29 billion raised by Saudi Aramco in 2019 \u2013 just to keep xAI in the game. The industrial logic for combining Space X with xAI is thin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are not many synergies between launching rockets and operating a network of satellites, an AI start-up that lags its competitors and a controversial social media platform where the interest on its debt absorbs roughly half its revenues. xAI\u2019s Grok chatbot doesn\u2019t have the users or financial backers (almost the entire AI sector) that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has, nor the distribution platform of Google\u2019s Gemini or the corporate acceptance of a rival start-up, Anthropic (which moved markets with the release of new AI productivity tools on Tuesday). xAI is getting a helping hand. Bloomberg SpaceX said it was acquiring xAI to \u201cform the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile communications and the world\u2019s foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\u201d Musk himself said the rationale for the merger was that, within two or three years, the least expensive way to do AI computations would be in space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe envisages putting AI data centres into space on SpaceX\u2019s rockets and said there would be cost efficiencies that would enable innovative companies to train their models and process data at unprecedented speeds and scales. \u201cThis marks not just the next chapter but the next book in SpaceX and xAI\u2019s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars,\u201d he said, whatever that means. Maybe the future of AI and the data centres needed to support it lies in space, but Musk seems to have skated over the logistics and costs of building something in space that is already stretching, to their limits, AI companies on Earth. The sector\u2019s insatiable appetite for capital has outstripped the capacity or willingness of equity markets to supply it, hence the increasing levels of debt in the sector and the incestuous deals between its participants. There is some financial logic to the combination, given that SpaceX is cashflow positive \u2013 it appears to have generated more than $US2 billion of positive cashflow last year and is on a steeply rising curve \u2013 while xAI churned through $US9.5 billion in the first nine months of last year at an annualised rate of more than $US12.5 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears obvious, however, that the capital SpaceX raises in its IPO will be quickly devoured by xAI unless the industry trend of capital expenditures rising at a much greater rate than revenues can be reversed. Related Article Opinion\n\nBillionaires Why Australian billionaires are falling behind their uber rich peers Elizabeth Knight Business columnist Musk does, of course, still have Tesla, valued by the market at more than $US1.5 trillion, that he could merge into a Musk Inc conglomerate if he needs more cash (and if its change in strategy from EVs to robotaxis and robots produces cashflows and earnings to validate the valuation). On his track record, such a merger appears quite a likely eventuality, particularly if xAI\u2019s demands for cash outstrip SpaceX\u2019s ability to generate it. Musk\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d for SpaceX appears fanciful. He has, however, demonstrated a remarkable capacity to convince investors to capitalise his visions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData centres in space, transported by SpaceX rockets, fed by xAI\u2019s models that have trained on X\u2019s data, perhaps with some future input from Tesla\u2019s engineers and with roles for its robots? It all sounds fantastical but, if he gets a $US1.5 trillion valuation for SpaceX in its float, it would signal that there are plenty of investors who think his vision can be realised.

In recent years, the research has moved away from the impact of individual \u201csuperfoods\u201d and antioxidants to focus on how overall, long-term dietary habits affect risk. That\u2019s not to say that any individual cancer diagnosis can be blamed on someone\u2019s diet; cancer, after all, arises as a result of a large constellation of factors \u2013 and it occurs in people who make healthy choices. Decades of research suggests that your diet can influence the risk of various cancers. Getty Images/iStockphoto But on a population level, there are some trends in the data. Here\u2019s what we know. Prioritise plants\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEating patterns that emphasise whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean or plant-based proteins have shown the most consistent association with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. One reason may be that people who follow these eating patterns have lower levels of insulin and inflammation, said Fred Tabung, who studies diet, metabolism and cancer at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Centre. Related Article Health This little organ is rarely thought about \u2013 and it\u2019s costing lives Chronically high levels of insulin and inflammation are key features of obesity and metabolic syndrome, which mediate cancer risk. High insulin and inflammation also promote unnecessary cell division, cell growth, DNA damage and the inhibition of cell death, which are all hallmarks of cancer, Tabung said. Whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and legumes and nuts contain lots of dietary fibre, which has been associated with lower cancer risk. This may be because fibre helps speed stool along the digestive tract, limiting exposure to carcinogens, and because it feeds microbes in the gut that help protect against inflammation, said Dr Kimmie Ng, associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Tabung added that leafy, green vegetables like lettuce, kale, spinach and arugula, and dark yellow vegetables like carrots, yams and squash, when part of a broader dietary pattern, appeared to promote lower levels of insulin and inflammation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChoose your meat carefully The International Agency for Research on Cancer has labelled processed meat like bacon, salami and hot dogs as carcinogenic to humans. The agency has said red meat is \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d due to limited but strong evidence. Research has shown that the type of iron in red meat, as well as the chemicals formed when red meat is cooked at high temperatures, for example during grilling and smoking, produce compounds involved in DNA damage. Nitrates and nitrites in processed meats have also been strongly associated with cancer. Nutrition and cancer researchers recommend avoiding processed meats altogether, and limiting red meat to two to three servings per week. If you are going to grill, use an acidic marinade, like one that\u2019s citrus- or vinegar-based, as that can help reduce the amount of carcinogens formed, said Carrie Daniel-MacDougall, a professor of epidemiology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre. Or instead eat fish, which may independently lower cancer risk, said Dr Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist at Mass General Brigham. Limit ultra-processed foods There is increasing evidence linking ultra-processed foods, including sugar-sweetened beverages, to cancer. One reason might be that they tend to be high in sugar and calories, which can contribute to insulin resistance and obesity. But lab studies also suggest that chemicals in these foods alter the balance between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d gut microbes and damage the gut lining, promoting inflammation, Chan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study of a large French cohort showed that several common preservatives increased the risk of all cancer, and particularly breast and prostate cancer. About a third of the preservatives that subjects consumed came from ultra-processed foods, but they were also found in alcohol, dried or canned fruits, and packaged vegetables. Related Article Nutrition Can we call butter and beef tallow \u2018healthy fats\u2019? You can limit your intake of preservatives by buying whole, fresh or frozen produce and prepared foods made only with ingredients you might find in a household kitchen, said Mathilde Touvier, director of the nutritional epidemiology research team at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research. Drink less, or not at all The risks of alcohol are greatest for heavy and binge drinkers, but even light drinking increases the risk of some cancers. \u201cThere\u2019s no safe level for cancer risk,\u201d said Giota Mitrou, executive director of research and policy for the American Institute for Cancer Research. \u201cLess is better and avoiding is best,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study, for example, showed that consistent heavy alcohol intake and higher lifetime consumption (averaging 14 or more drinks per week) increased the risk of colorectal cancer; quitting appeared to lower the risk. Alcohol may cause cancer in a few ways, Mitrou said. The body breaks it down into acetaldehyde, which is toxic to cells. Alcohol increases levels of estrogen, which fuels some types of breast cancer. And it has been linked to oxidative stress \u2014 when the body produces too many unstable molecules that react with DNA \u2013 and may interfere with DNA repair. If you do drink, avoid doing so on an empty stomach. Drinking without food may result in a higher exposure to carcinogens, Ng said. Consider coffee, tea and dairy Tabung found that drinking up to three cups of coffee or tea per day was associated with lower levels of insulin resistance and inflammation. Coffee and tea are full of chemicals that help protect cells from damage, said Robin Ralston, a dietitian and nutritionist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Centre. She encourages drinking them \u2013 whether hot or cold, brewed at home or drunk from a bottle \u2013 as long as there isn\u2019t added sugar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDairy, and the calcium in it, appears to lower colorectal cancer risk. As part of a broader healthy diet, full-fat dairy \u2013 which was recently endorsed in new federal dietary guidelines \u2013 was also associated with reduced inflammation and insulin resistance in some studies. Ralston recommended fermented dairy like plain yoghurt, kefir and cheese because they can support gut health and have been associated with reduced inflammation in several studies. Related Article Fitness The goal posts for a longer, healthier life are closer than you think Know the risks of obesity The clearest link between diet and cancer is through obesity. A large body of evidence has linked obesity to more than a dozen cancers, including breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, kidney, liver and pancreatic cancers. Obesity, of course, is not just the product of diet, but also physical activity, genetics and other factors, said Edward Giovannucci, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But to the extent that diet leads to excess body fat or body weight, that is likely \u201cthe biggest single impact of diet on cancer risk,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFat tissue increases estrogen, which is a driver for some kinds of breast and endometrial cancer. Fat that accumulates in the abdomen, called visceral fat, promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, Giovannucci said. Exercise \u2013 at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week \u2013 can increase insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation, in addition to helping with weight loss. Some early research has suggested that GLP-1 drugs may also reduce cancer risk, but evidence is limited. Maintaining a healthy body weight and exercising to promote good metabolic health are \u201ca big part of the battle,\u201d Giovannucci said \u2013 and not only to lower cancer risk. \u201cIt overlaps a lot with diabetes, cardiovascular risks and dementia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all tied together.\u201d This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

    "text": "An Australian council has taken the rare step of allowing residents to paint the road in front of their properties in a bid to instruct drivers where to park, to avert a long-standing parking problem in Aussie suburbs. While the move is \"not legally enforceable\", it's hoped it might prevent further disputes.\n\nThe Neighbourhood Watch Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby (NHWK&H) shared images this week, saying fed-up homeowners may now paint white demarcation lines on the road to prevent motorists parking over the resident's driveway.\n\nWhile the organisation is a community group and not a government division, the Ku-ring-gai Council, on Sydney's Upper North Shore, confirmed it backs the move to prevent vehicles blocking driveways.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"[The act] not only upsets schedules, but can block the moving of bags of shopping, wheelchairs and prams,\" NHWK&H said this week.\n\nThe Ku-ring-gai Council acknowledged the lines aren't legally enforceable, but believes they may \"serve as an encouragement to motorists\" not to obstruct driveways, and allow for better visibility.\n\n\"They also provide guidance to rangers to judge whether a vehicle is parked too close to or obstructing a driveway,\" the council said.\n\n\"Legally, motorists can park up to the wing of a driveway. Where a painted transverse parking line is present, motorists are highly encouraged to park in accordance with this line marking.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe nearby Hornsby Council has also \"OK'd residents painting their own white lines\", NHWK&H said.\n\n\"The rule, however, is that they must be painted at the top of the kerb,\" it said.\n\nResidents in the area who would like white lines on the kerb outside of their property can register their interest here.\n\nDo you have a story about illegal parking?

Source: Facebook/Keri Michael/Mosman Collective\n\nOnline, the original post prompted a bit of confusion among some locals.\n\n\"Not legally enforceable ... yet you keep implying it [is]. The law is ambiguous on it, so please don't say it is legal,\" one person said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Would that be vandalism? It's graffiti on the road,\" said another.\n\nOthers praised the move. \"Not a car in sight \u2014 well done,\" a man wrote.\n\nAustralia's growing driveway parking problem\n\nOver the years, parking over driveways has emerged as a major concern for residents right across Australia, with numerous examples emerging in recent times.\n\nIn October, motorists in Sydney's east were warned that parking across someone\u2019s driveway will soon result in a steep $600 fine, with their cars also being towed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Waverley Council said in 2025, vehicles blocking driveway access were one of the most common gripes to the council, with 2,136 complaints recorded.\n\nIn the year to May 2025, the Inner West Council said it had received an incredible 4,393 complaints concerning the contentious act.\n\nIn response, it now orders tow trucks to remove vehicles obstructing driveways. It also doubled fines for offending drivers from $320 to $660.\n\nEven with permission, blocking driveway access can prove costly, as a Queensland man found out in November.\n\nIn Concord in Sydney, frustrated neighbours of a busy hospital have started painting their own white lines on the street.\n\nA driver was recently branded 'arrogant' for blocking a public footpath in Sydney's north.
