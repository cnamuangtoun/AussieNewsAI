    "text": "Productivity: it's the crucial economic principle that has helped propel Australians into some of the best living standards in the world.\n\nBut \ufeffeven as politicians and economists discuss it more and more, ahead of the federal government's crucial upcoming roundtable, it's something that many people still don't quite understand.\n\nSo what actually is productivity, and why are experts so concerned with it at the moment? This is what you need to know.\n\nProductivity has driven the massive improvement in Australian living standards since mid-last century. (Edwina Pickles/SMH)\n\nWhat is productivity?\n\nThink of productivity as working smarter, not harder.\ufeff\n\nEconomically speaking, productivity is the amount of output you get from a set of inputs.\n\nInputs are things like labour \u2013 often measured as the number of employees or number of hours worked \u2013 and capital, while output is the amount of goods and services produced.\n\nFor a basic example, let's say a fast food outlet employs five staff, who work a combined 200 hours per week, and produces 5000 burgers over the course of that week. Its productivity would be 25 burgers per hour worked.\n\n\ufeffSo, put super simply, productivity is how much stuff you get from a set amount of effort.\ufeff\n\nProductivity growth has been slowing in Australia and most other advanced economies. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\n\ufeffIs productivity falling in Australia?\n\nProductivity itself isn't falling, but productivity growth is most certainly on the decline in Australia.\n\n\ufeffThe Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) main, top-line measure of productivity growth has fallen substantially in recent years.\n\nIn 2022-23, the 20-year average annual growth rate had fallen to 0.9 per cent, down from 1.2 per cent the year before and just half of the 1.8 per cent it was in 2003-04.\n\nIt's important to note this problem isn't unique to Australia; just about every developed country is experiencing slowing productivity.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nImproved productivity is responsible for Australians' improved living standards.\n\nIt leads to higher wages, \ufeffmore (and cheaper and better-quality) goods and services available, bigger profits for businesses, and overall economic growth.\n\nIt also even paves the way for more leisure time; according to the Productivity Commission, the average Australian now spends five fewer hours at work every week than in 1960 due to better productivity.\n\nBut if growth continues to slow, it puts all those benefits at risk.\n\nImproved productivity has allowed companies to produce more goods that are both cheaper and better quality. (Getty)\n\n\ufeffTo put a dollar figure on it, the Productivity Commission estimates that full-time workers will be $14,000 a year worse off by 2035 if Australia can't rediscover its previous growth and instead continues on its current trend.\n\n\ufeff\"The implications of that, I think, are already being felt,\" RBA Governor Michele Bullock said on August 12.\n\n\"Real wages are not rising by very much, because that's the implication of slow productivity growth is that real wages can't grow as quickly.\n\n\"If we can get productivity growth up, that will allow for more growth in real wages, which is ultimately good for Australians.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence has been touted as a potential productivity gamechanger. (Getty)\n\nSo why is everyone talking about it now?\n\nWhile economists \ufeffhave been discussing productivity for decades \u2013 the Productivity Commission was established in the late '90s \u2013 a few developments have thrust it very firmly into the public eye.\n\nMost recently, the Reserve Bank downgraded its productivity growth forecasts from 1 to 0.7 per cent per year over the medium term.\n\n\ufeffThat came a week out from the federal government's productivity roundtable (officially the Economic Reform Roundtable), which was announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in June.\n\nREAD MORE: National push for teachers to use AI in Aussie schools \ufeff\n\nRBA Governor Michelle Bullock has warned Australians are already feeling the pinch of slowing productivity growth. (Dominic Lorrimer)\n\nWhat's the deal with the government's productivity roundtable?\n\nThe roundtable, to be held from August 19-21 in Canberra, will be a three-day discussion involving business and union leaders \ufeffabout how to address stagnating productivity growth.\n\nMany of the ideas put forward ahead of the summit have focused on tax (although AI, regulation, and even a four-day working week have also been discussed), following these comments made by Treasurer Jim Chalmers in June.\n\n\"No sensible progress can be made on productivity, resilience or budget sustainability without proper consideration of more tax reform,\" he told the National Press Club.\n\n\"I don't just accept that, I welcome it. Tax is one of many ways our three primary economic challenges are related\ufeff.\"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers flagged the economic roundtable could lead to tax reform. (Rohan Thomson/AFR)\n\nWill anything come out of it?\ufeff\n\nThat's the trillion-dollar question.\n\nAlbanese has been giving mixed messages\ufeff, at one point ruling out any new tax reform (\"the only tax policy that we're implementing is the one that we took to the election\") and reminding everyone that he and his ministers get final say on any productivity solutions (\"governments make government policy\").\n\nBut the prime minister has also welcomed the glut of proposals he and Chalmers have been presented with, and has insisted he's \"up for big reform\" \u2013 although it might be something he takes to the next election in 2028.\n\n\"We're up for discussion, and one of the things I said very clearly was we weren't going to get into the rule-in, rule-out game,\" he told ABC radio.\n\n\"We have a big agenda. We were elected with a clear mandate on May 3. That's our priority, delivering on that.\n\n\"But we're also up for ideas and we're up for things that can be done immediately. If they will improve the economy, then of course we'll give it consideration.\"\n\nAnthony Albanese has ruled out any new tax reform but at the same time said he's open to big ideas. (James Brickwood)\n\nRespected economist Richard Holden, who along with independent MP Kate Chaney proposed a revised GST model for the roundtable , said it was crucial that proper reform does come out of the summit.\n\n\ufeff\"That's the question: is the upcoming August 19 roundtable going to be a moment for genuinely thinking about bold ideas?\" he said.\n\n\"Or is it going to be another one of these pro-forma\ufeff... we have three days, we'll put out a press release and we go back to normal?\n\n\"I hope it's the former.\"\ufeff",

    "text": "Eastman Kodak, the 133-year-old photography company, is warning investors that it might not survive much longer.\n\nIn its earnings report earlier this week, the company warned that it doesn't have \"committed financing or available liquidity\" to pay its roughly $500 million (AUD$763 million) in upcoming debt obligations.\n\n\"These conditions raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern,\" Kodak said in a filing.\n\nKodak has been around for 133 years, but the once giant company may be in its final days. (AP)\n\nKodak aims to conjure up cash by ceasing payments for its retirement pension plan. It also said that it doesn't expect tariffs to have \"material impacts\" on its business because it manufactures many of its products, including cameras, inks and film in the United States.\n\n\"In the second quarter, Kodak continued to make progress against our long-term plan despite the challenges of an uncertain business environment,\" said Kodak CEO Jim Continenza in the earnings release.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Kodak spokesperson said that it's \"confident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due, and amend, extend or refinance our remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations.\"\n\nShares of Eastman Kodak (KODK) slumped more than 25 per cent in midday trading on Tuesday.\n\nRise and fall\n\nThe Eastman Kodak Company was incorporated in 1892, but the company traces its roots back to 1879, when George Eastman obtained his first patent for a plate-coating machine. In 1888, Eastman sold the first Kodak camera for $25.\n\nAt the time, photography was not a mass business because of the technical skills and equipment needed to do it, but the Kodak camera was designed to make photography more widely accessible. Eastman coined the slogan: \"You push the button, we do the rest.\"\n\nThe name was largely meaningless, with the word \"Kodak,\" according to the company, being invented by Eastman out of thin air: \"The letter 'K' had been a favorite with me \u2014 it seems a strong, incisive sort of letter.\"\n\nKodak had a century of success producing cameras and film. At one point in the 1970s, it was responsible for 90 per cent of film and 85 per cent of camera sales in the United States, according to The Economist. Paul Simon's hit song \"Kodachrome\" topped the charts in 1973.\n\nKodak tried and failed to keep up with the digital revolution. (Marina Oliphant)\n\nBut that powerful market position would not last because of the technology the company invented: Kodak introduced the first digital camera in 1975.\n\nKodak failed to capitalise on the rise of the digital technology. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy. At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, it had 100,000 creditors and debts totaling $6.75 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Kodak had a brief moment of reprieve when the US government tapped it to transform into a pharmaceutical ingredients producer. Kodak's stock price rose so fast it tripped 20 circuit breakers throughout the trading session.\n\nDespite its recent losses, Kodak recently said it aims to expand that part of its business. The company continues to manufacture films and chemicals for businesses, including the movie industry, and it licenses its brand for a variety of consumer products.",

    "text": "An Australian boss is championing workplace flexibility by shutting down his company's three offices every three months for a quarterly \"recharge day\".\n\nFour-day work weeks are back on the public agenda after the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) suggested it as a way to increase productivity, however Bryce Coombe's team has introduced something a little different.\n\nHypetap, an influencer marketing agency with offices in Sydney, Melbourne and London, offers staff an extra, no-strings-attached day off every quarter.\n\nHypetap MD Bryce Coombe said recharge days are key to staff well-being. (Supplied)\n\nHypetap managing director Coombe told 9news.com.au that a regular \"recharge day\" on top of weekends, public holidays and annual leave helps his high-performing team to avoid burnout.\n\n\"The best sports stars in the world don't run 100 kilometres all day, every day and never rest,\" Coombe said.\n\n\"We thought, how do we take that principle and that learning and apply it to our team? Because our team is also high-performing.\"\n\nThe staff at Hypetap's Melbourne and Sydney offices are offered the same day off four times per year, while those in London prefer different days due to the different seasons.\n\nCoombes and the leadership team took a mathematical approach to when each quarter they should shut the offices down.\n\n\"We looked at the calendar and we calculated the biggest gaps and periods between public holidays,\" he said.\n\n\"Particularly in the middle of the year, it's very Melbourne-centric, but when it's dark and cold and miserable, where the next public holiday is a long way away.\"\n\nHyeptap also always makes the recharge day a Friday, giving staff an additional four three-day weekends every year.\n\nIt was a post-COVID idea the company introduced three years ago.\n\nHypetap shuts down its offices in Sydney, Melbourne and London every few months. (Supplied)\n\nCoombe said the nearly 40 staff members in his growing team \"love\" the extra time off.\n\n\"All of our clients are aware of it and know so it doesn't interrupt service in any way,\" he added.\n\n\"You need good processes and systems to allow you to do this kind of recharge day activity.\"\n\nAssociate professor at the ANU Research School of Management David Cheng has noticed Australian offices are rejecting rigid structure in ways that aren't just working from home or four day weeks.\n\nThese are top 10 'best' companies to work for in Australia View Gallery\n\nHe said extra benefits like this need to be backed up by a strong culture to actually impact well-being.\n\n\"If you have a recharge day but then work extra hard, you may lose the benefit of having the recharge day in the first place,\" Cheng explained.\n\nHe believes the same might be true for companies trialling the four-day week.\n\n\"Switching to four days a week, if you don't have the right/management culture may not lead to the same benefits and could lead to more stress,\" Cheng added.\n\n\"The research suggests that people who work four days can be as productive as five.\n\n\"That said, it's worth remembering that many of the companies that have done this so far, may have good managers who care about their workers and organisations with the right culture to try new things.\"\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nThe staff at Hyeptap's Melbourne and Sydney offices are offered the same day off four time per year. (Getty)\n\nCoombe said Hypetap's leadership team aims to cultivate a positive work-life balance outside of recharge days too.\n\nIt's not just about throwing in a free day off to avoid addressing core issues, he explained.\n\n\"Our team's well-being, avoiding burnout and making sure that we're delivering great results is really important to us,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a way of tangibly putting our money where our mouth is. It's not just like, hey, get one day off for your birthday.\n\n\"These are four set days where we're going to shut everything down, literally the building shuts down on those days.\n\n\"It's about exemplifying and being demonstrative about our beliefs.\"",

    "text": "Maggie Beer has a financial deadline for her culinary mission to transform food at thousands of aged care homes .\n\nThe effusive celebrity chef, 80, is using her reputation and influence to head up the Maggie Beer Foundation and has been working to put delicious food onto the plates of vulnerable elderly Australians.\n\nSpeaking at the National Press Club in Canberra today, Beer said the government cash injection to her foundation for first-of-its-kind specialised chef training in aged care homes will run out in 2026.\n\nREAD MORE: National push for teachers to use AI in Aussie classrooms\n\nMaggie Beer, Founder of the Maggie Beer Foundation addresses the media at the National Press Club. (Getty)\n\n\"We simply have not got the capacity to meet demand and our current funding ends in September next year,\" Beer said.\n\n\"[We've had] 135 homes will be through this program. Every day, we get a new inquiry. 135 homes doesn't sound much, but believe you me, the filtering down effect is there.\n\n\"We, the foundation, myself, personally, are advocating fiercely for it to continue.\"\n\nBeer is building a roadmap for a future model of aged care and food is at the heart of it.\n\nPart of the mission is to bridge the training gap in cook and chef roles across the nearly 2700 Commonwealth-subsidised homes in Australia.\n\nHer message has been simple: lovingly-prepared, nutritious food equals better wellbeing.\n\nShe told the press club that an ageing population urgently demands more skilled chefs, kitchen hands and staff with a passion for food.\n\n\"Beautiful food will make such a difference to the wellbeing of residents and pride of the teams,\" she said.\n\n\"Without those equal amounts of flavour, goodness and pleasure, food becomes a commodity.\n\n\"Food becomes institutionalised, and leads to residents not eating well, or not eating enough. And that leads to malnutrition.\"\n\nBeer is building a roadmap for a future model of aged care and food is at the heart of it. (Getty)\n\nBeer said meals shouldn't be an \"afterthought\" in aged care homes.\n\nBut she acknowledged that underfunding is rampant. In 2021/22, an average of just $14.46 was spent on food per resident per day at aged care providers.\n\n\"Fresh real ingredients provide flavour that frozen never can, and we can show aged care homes that cooking fresh actually does not cost more,\" she added.\n\n\"However, only if supported by the skill set, passion and knowledge and support of management, it is all possible and because I know there's so little money to spare within aged care homes.\"\n\nAged care facilities are home to some of the most vulnerable members of Australia's elderly population.\n\nAccording to Dementia Australia, there are an estimated 433,300 Australians living with dementia in 2025.\n\nAnd over half of the 245,000 people in aged care were living with dementia as of 2022.\n\nBeer said good food can be a familiar, safe space for those enduring the sometimes traumatic transition of moving into care.\n\n\"One of the most evocative things is a sense of smell that stays with us and smell that links to good memories,\" Beer explained.\n\n\"Living with dementia is so hard but I can tell you those instincts are still there.\n\n\"It's never going to be easy, but all those things can make such a difference.\"\n\nThe celebrity chef said meals shouldn't be an \"afterthought\" in aged care homes. (Maggie Beer/Instagram)\n\nIn a submission on the Aged Care Bill 2024, The Maggie Beer Foundation Trainer Mentor Program asked for an extension to its funding beyond September 2026.\n\nThe Maggie Beer Foundation has petitioned for $15.3 million across three years to fund \ufeffits program to improve food in aged care and solutions for older people recieving care at home.\n\nBeer also issued a plea to the Federal Minister for Ageing and Seniors Sam Rae, who was sitting in the room in Canberra today, for more funding.\n\n\"We run a very lean show. And there's no money for us to be funded,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't bear to think of it as being lost. It's so very valuable.\n\n\"So you can be sure I will be advocating fiercely again to the government to support the program.\"",

If you have more information about this story please contact Nassim Khadem at khadem.nassim@abc.net.au or nassimkhadem@protonmail.com\n\nThis included investigations into insurance premiums not being refunded correctly after members had died, member accounts not being created with default insurance, and updates to member information not being processed by the trustee.\n\nASIC also alleged Mercer Super provided false or misleading information in reports to ASIC, which understated the number of members who were impacted.\n\n\"We allege a pattern of longstanding and systemic failure by Mercer Super to comply with the law,\" ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said.\n\n\"These aren't just technical breaches. Allowing investigations into significant issues to drag on for months or, in some cases, over a year without reporting them to ASIC demonstrates a lack of care for customers and can put more at risk.\n\n\"As one of Australia's largest super funds, Mercer Super should have had adequate systems in place to manage and monitor critical issues like this.\"\n\nSarah Court wants super funds to do better. (ABC News: Billy Cooper)\n\nSuper funds put on notice over how they respond to member complaints\n\nMs Court said ASIC's reportable situation regime was in place to ensure the corporate watchdog could identify misconduct early and take action to protect Australians.\n\nCathy was compensated just $29 for super fund's death benefit delay Photo shows A woman with long blonde hair sits in an armchair and looks over her right shoulder at a window. Australia's corporate watchdog calls on superannuation funds to overhaul the way they deal with death benefit claims.\n\n\"Customers expect their super funds to abide by the law,\" she said.\n\nShe said, aside from taking legal action against superannuation funds, ASIC has also issued 34 death benefit claims recommendations to super trustees and flagged its next phase of work focusing on how trustees respond to customer complaints.\n\nAustralia's corporate watchdog has repeatedly called on superannuation funds to overhaul the way they deal with death benefit claims, noting excessive delays, poor customer service, and ineffective claims handling are leaving Australians worse off at some of the most vulnerable times of their lives.\n\nIn a speech in June 2025, ASIC chair Joe Longo outlined that the next phase of ASIC's work in the superannuation sector will address how trustees learn from and respond to the complaints they receive.\n\nMs Court said Mercer Super's alleged conduct falls well below what ASIC expects of a trustee of its size and market position.\n\n\"There is work underway to review and simplify the regime, but that doesn't mean trustees can avoid their obligations,\" she said.\n\n\" Mercer Super's alleged failure to meet those obligations over several years is why we're taking action. \"\n\nASIC is seeking declarations and penalties from the court.\n\nMercer has been contacted for comment.\n\nASIC noted that in August 2024, in a separate case, Mercer Super was fined $11.3 million after it admitted making misleading statements about the sustainable nature and characteristics of some of its superannuation investment options.",

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nIn a letter yesterday, Mr Watt said this law change had been used to end the reconsideration request.\n\nThe Bob Brown Foundation (BBF) took the legislation change to the Federal Court, which was due to hold a hearing next week.\n\nMr Watt's decision means this legal challenge will come to an end.\n\nRare fish numbers dropped by nearly 50 per cent\n\nThe decision reaffirms the 2012 expansion decision by then-environment minister Tony Burke.\n\nThis included a water-monitoring regime, limits to the amount of farmed fish biomass in the harbour, and requirements to clean up debris.\n\nThere are 11 marine fish farming licences in Macquarie Harbour.\n\nSalmon farming peaked in the harbour at 20,000 tonnes in 2014-15, when a decline in water quality was noticed, and there were two die-off events in 2019.\n\nTasmania's Environment Protection Authority (EPA) reduced stocking rates in 2017, and again in 2020, down to 9,500 tonnes, before setting dissolved nitrogen limits.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, estimates for numbers of Maugean skate \u2014 a stingray-like fish species found only in the harbour \u2014 had fallen by 47 per cent.\n\nEnvironmental groups fear salmon farming in the harbour is putting the Maugean skate at risk.

    "text": "Taylor Swift's new album might be called The Life of a Showgirl, but her ability to whip her fans into a frenzy ahead of the announcement has one expert calling her a \"marketing mastermind\".\n\nSwift announced the news of the album on the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs footballer Travis Kelce.\n\nKelce hosts the New Heights podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce, a former Philadelphia Eagles player.\n\n\"This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl,\" Swift said, brandishing a blurred vinyl copy of her new album while Jason roared as if she had scored a touchdown.\n\nThe short clip was posted to Instagram ahead of the full episode's release and racked up more than 168 million views in a day.\n\nGraeme Hughes, a business and consumer expert at Griffith University, said Swift's announcement of her 12th album was \"a brilliant display of marketing genius, proving once more why she's at the top of the music game\".\n\nTaylor Swift has revealed the album art and release date of The Life of a Showgirl. (Instagram: @taylorswift)\n\nFirst, the New Heights podcast posted that it would have a very special guest joining its next episode.\n\nThen, Swift's social media kicked things up a notch by blatantly sharing that a new era was arriving imminently.\n\nFinally, a countdown clock appeared on her website.\n\n\"Swifties were sent into a frenzy after the singer's official social media team, Taylor Nation, dropped a series of cryptic 'Easter eggs',\" Dr Hughes told ABC News.\n\n\"A countdown clock, a change in social media profile pictures to a blurry orange and mint-green graphic, and a 12-photo carousel featuring Swift in orange outfits from her record-breaking Eras Tour all pointed to one thing: a new era.\"\n\nDr Hughes said Swift's \"strategic\" move to announce the new album on her partner's podcast, thereby blending her personal life with her professional career, \"generated massive buzz across both music and sports media\".\n\n\"Swift's playbook is a masterclass in modern marketing, using fan engagement, scarcity with limited-edition vinyl and cassettes, and a drip-feed of clues to build anticipation to a fever pitch,\" he said.\n\n\" It's a strategy that turns album releases into global events and solidifies her place as not just a musician, but a marketing mastermind. \"\n\nTaylor Swift deployed a countdown clock to stir fans into a frenzy of what her latest announcement could be. (Getty Images: Kevin Winter/TAS24)\n\nGeorgia Carroll, a fan culture researcher, said the countdown clock was a new strategy for Swift.\n\n\"That gets everybody staying online, everybody focused, and it also allows her to direct the traffic to her own channels,\" Dr Carroll told ABC News.\n\n\"Obviously, everyone will be watching New Heights and their channels for the podcast, but the countdown led to a pre-order link on her store, so obviously that was a very clever way to keep people on that page.\"\n\n'Relationship-led' rollout\n\nBefore the pandemic, Swift traditionally released an album every two years, according to Dr Carroll.\n\n\"Obviously, we saw that shift during the pandemic with Folklore and Evermore, her surprise album drops,\" she said.\n\n\"Ever since then, it's been a bit more of, 'When is this going to happen? What are the clues? How are we hunting this down?'\n\n\"But I don't think anyone expected it to be released through the New Heights podcast, of all places.\"\n\nTravis Kelce embraced Taylor Swift after the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year. (AP: John Locher)\n\nWhile this album announcement might appear less glitzy than revealing the news on stage at the Grammys, Dr Carroll said the decision was just as savvy.\n\n\"It makes sense because it's a way that she can control her narrative and tell the story of the album in a way that she knows won't be twisted, while also revealing more of herself to her fans.\n\n\"We've never really seen her in conversation with her partner before.\n\n\" She's never really done podcast interviews before, and in recent years she hasn't really done that many interviews full stop. \"\n\nDr Carroll said the release of a Travis Kelce profile in GQ magazine, timed with Swift's album announcement, showed the couple were \"maximising these opportunities\".\n\nIn the article, Kelce spoke at length about how he and his girlfriend had a lot in common by both entertaining sold-out stadiums.\n\nDr Carroll said it had been a \"very clever, relationship-led build-up to the album dropping\".\n\n'Glitter gel pen album'\n\nThe Life of a Showgirl will be Swift's 12th album and is due to be released on October 3.\n\nIn the past, Swift has categorised her songs into different categories, with fun, happy love songs being classified as \"glitter gel pen songs\".\n\nWhile Taylor Swift has released the album's name, fans are left wondering what the album cover will look like. (Andreas Rentz/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)\n\n\"There's been a lot of glitter involved in this, so fans have been speculating that this is going to be a glitter gel pen album,\" Dr Carroll said.\n\nWhile tracks are yet to be released, Dr Carroll believes the album announcement hints at Kelce playing a bigger part on the record.\n\nTaylor Swift's Eras Tour has ended. These numbers show its impact Photo shows Taylor Swift smiles and waves on stage in a purple tinsel jacket and a blue sparkling bodysuit It's been a long time coming, but Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has come to an end. As the dust (and glitter) begins to settle, these numbers show how it became one of the biggest concert tours of all time.\n\n\"There's a lot of expectation that as much as it may also be musings on fame and life during the Era's tour, Travis was obviously a very big part of that,\" she said.\n\n\"I think the fact that we get him talking about the relationship in depth for the first real time today, and then her launching it in a podcast with his brother and giving them exclusivity \u2014 it's very much a big hint as to what we can expect.\n\nSwift has traditionally left the subjects of her songs up to interpretation \u2014 but Dr Carroll argues this launch tells a different story.",

    "text": "Late Victorian London wasn't an easy place to achieve musical success if you were mixed-race and born outside of marriage, like composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.\n\nDespite never setting foot in Africa, Coleridge-Taylor's music was often inspired by his African heritage, and he became one of Britain's foremost black composers.\n\n\"He was a composer who was really tapping into this idea of an African diaspora, which was pretty revolutionary for his time,\" says US-based harpist and music advocate Ashley Jackson.\n\nA prolific composer and early champion of the equal rights movement, Coleridge-Taylor's lifetime coincided with the heyday of the British empire and a golden age for British composers.\n\nHis contemporaries, such as Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst are household names for classical music lovers today.\n\nIn contrast, for decades Coleridge-Taylor was consigned to history. But thanks to the work and advocacy of diverse musicians, Coleridge-Taylor's music is now being shared with new audiences.\n\nA talented musician from disadvantaged beginnings\n\nColeridge-Taylor was born in 1875 to a working-class family in London. His mother named him after the 18th century poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\nDespite never meeting his Sierra Leonian father, a medical student who lived in London for a time, Coleridge-Taylor's life was profoundly shaped by his African heritage.\n\nHow a new generation is invigorating classical music Photo shows Abel Selaocoe performing with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, seated onstage with his cello. Musicians like Abel Selaocoe, Jessica Cottis and Mindy Meng Wang are reimagining what classical music can be when we uplift diverse voices and traditions.\n\nHis mother's family recognised and nurtured Coleridge-Taylor's musical talents. His grandfather taught him the violin and later, the family found a way to send him to the Royal College of Music aged 17.\n\nColeridge-Taylor initially learnt composition from respected British composer Charles Villier Stanford, who also taught Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nBoth composers wrote a substantial amount of music for choirs, orchestras and small chamber music ensembles.\n\nVaughan Williams's music, such as Fantasia On A Theme by Thomas Tallis and The Lark Ascending, are still extremely beloved by classical music lovers today, including Australian audiences.\n\nBut until recently, Coleridge-Taylor was only famous for one lone piece of music.\n\nEnormous success and financial failure\n\nColeridge-Taylor's most famous composition is a trilogy of cantatas called The Song of Hiawatha. Based on an 1855 poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, it follows a fictional Native American love story between Hiawatha, an Ojibwe warrior, and Minnehaha, a Decota woman who subsequently died during a famine.\n\nThe first cantata, Hiawatha's Wedding Feast, achieved critical acclaim in Britain and the US.\n\nPoster of the Hiawatha performances at the Royal Albert Hall from the 1930s. (Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Foundation)\n\nStanford conducted the world premiere in 1898. The concert was attended by the who's who of British composers, including Hubert Parry, whose music has been used in British coronations since 1902, Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert and Sullivan fame, and Edward Elgar, whose high opinion established Coleridge-Taylor's name.\n\nHiawatha's Wedding Feast, written for choir and orchestra, opened doors for Coleridge-Taylor, who was asked to write the sequels The Death Of Minnehaha and Hiawatha's Departure.\n\nColeridge-Taylor conducted Hiawatha's Wedding Feast on three tours to the US in 1904, 1906 and 1910. On his first visit, Coleridge-Taylor was received by President Theodore Roosevelt at the White House, a reportedly rare opportunity for someone of African descent.\n\nThe music's popularity endured after his death.\n\n\"In the years between the world wars, the Hiawatha's festival in Royal Albert Hall in London was an extremely popular affair,\" says Andrew Ford, presenter of The Music Show.\n\n\"World War II in 1939 put a stop to the festival, but even in the 1970s I remember posters for performances in England,\" Ford says.\n\nThe score for Hiawatha's Wedding Feast sold hundreds of thousands of copies, and was said to rival the popularities of Handel's Messiah and Mendelssohn's Elijah.\n\nBut Coleridge-Taylor didn't receive much financial benefit from the sales. He sold the music outright for an immediate sum of 15 guineas, equivalent to over $26,525 in today's money.\n\nEven though Coleridge-Taylor negotiated better deals for the subsequent cantatas, they weren't as commercially successful as Hiawatha's Wedding Feast.\n\nWhen Coleridge-Taylor died at the age of 37 in financial strife, his case catalysed other musicians to establish royalty payments.\n\nBecoming a champion for equal rights\n\nHis musical talent and success didn't spare Coleridge-Taylor from the effects of racism during his lifetime.\n\nColeridge-Taylor drew inspirations from his African heritage, writing music based on many African-American spirituals. (Wikimedia Commons: Adam Cuerden)\n\nColeridge-Taylor's father returned to Africa without knowing his son's existance because of slim prospects to practise as a doctor in London.\n\nColeridge-Taylor's marriage to fellow musician Jessie Walmisley was initially opposed by her parents because he was mixed-race.\n\n\"[He] knew at first-hand both of discrimination by 'race', and of the shared objective by others of a more even playing field for all,\" says sociologist and writer Hilary Burrage, one of the directors of the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Foundation.\n\n\"Victorian London was more varied of skin colour than some imagine.\"\n\nColeridge-Taylor attended the 1900 First Pan-African Conference, a landmark event for equal rights. He befriended African-American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, setting many of his poems to music.\n\nHe also incorporated influences from African diaspora into many of his compositions, including the 'Othello' Orchestral Suite, African Suite and Twenty-Four Negro Melodies which were inspired by African-American spirituals.\n\nColeridge-Taylor was reported to have said about the melodies:\n\n\"What Brahms has done for the Hungarian folk music, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k for the Bohemian, and Grieg for the Norwegian, I have tried to do for these Negro Melodies.\"\n\nColeridge-Taylor's legacy for musicians today\n\nOne of the problems with forgotten classical music figures is that often, there are complex reasons for their neglect.\n\n\"In a way, the success of Hiawatha's Wedding Feast coupled with Coleridge-Taylor's early death contributed to the neglect of his music,\" Ford reflects. \"His popularity might even lead people to not take him seriously.\"\n\nToday, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor is better known for his instrumental music and songs.\n\nIn 2021, pianist Isata Kaneh-Mason, who also has Sierra Leonian heritage, included Coleridge-Taylor's arrangement of Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child in her album Summertime.\n\nIn 2022, London-based, ethnically-diverse orchestra Chineke! released a recording of Coleridge-Taylor's music, including his African Suite and Ballade In A Minor.\n\nHarpist Ashley Jackson found Coleridge-Taylor's Twenty-Four Negro Melodies while working on her previous album Ennanga, inspired by African-American spirituals.\n\nIn her most recent album Take Me To The Water, Jackson included Deep River from the same set of melodies.\n\nHarpist Ashley Jackson says music can bring people together when musical choices reflect people's diversity.\n\nColeridge-Taylor is often cited as an inspiration and role-model for diverse musicians alongside Florence Price, William Grant Still and others. His children, Hiawatha (Bryan) and Gwendalin (Avril) Coleridge-Taylor became composers and conductors in their own rights. It's a vindication for a composer who has been forgotten for decades.\n\nBut 150 years after Coleridge-Taylor's birth, some in the classical music world are still asking: does classical music have a diversity problem?\n\nJackson, who is an advocate for diversity and inclusion in classical music, says there's still a lot of work to do to honour the contributions of diverse musicians from past and present.\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Jackson cites historian Kira Thurman, who remarks:\n\n\" Classical music, like whiteness itself, is frequently racially unmarked and presented as universal \u2014 until people of colour start performing it. \"\n\nChineke! orchestra founder, Chi-chi Nwanoku, experiences this conundrum firsthand.\n\n\"This is the 21st century. It should not be a novelty when there is more than one black face on the stage,\" she told ABC Classic during the group's visit to Australia in 2022.\n\nJackson says rather than celebrating the milestones of being the first or the only musician of colour on stage, we should instead focus on diversifying voices of composers and performers in the music world. And one way to do this is by intentionally diversifying our musical choices.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to [feature] pieces of music that reflect the diversity of humanity,\" Jackson says.\n\nThis is how music's power to bring people together can be demonstrated, she says.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

    "text": "When Fremantle run out against Brisbane on Friday night, the sense of opportunity among the purple haze will be palpable.\n\nEleven wins from the Dockers past 12 games has them in fourth on the AFL ladder, and has instilled a belief they can win from any position.\n\nFremantle has trailed at three-quarter time in four of its past five games, and gone on to win all of them.\n\nTwo of those teams, Collingwood and Hawthorn, are considered finals sides, with the Magpies a premiership contender up until recently.\n\nAlex Pearce (centre) kicked the winning goal for Fremantle against Port Adelaide on Saturday night. (AAP Image: Matt Turner)\n\nThe Dockers meet the Lions at an ideal time \u2014 the reigning premiers have lost two of their past three matches and one of those was an 11-goal thrashing by Gold Coast.\n\nThey are also missing dual-Brownlow Medallist Lachie Neale, forward Kai Lohmann and defender Connor McKenna.\n\n\"Gold Coast got them, but then they bounce back really, really well,\" Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir said.\n\n\"Their form on the road's been really strong this year. You know their game, much like ours, is built on contest and stoppage.\n\n\" It's going to be a good head-to-head battle. \"\n\nDockers dialled in\n\nDuring their recent run of form, the Dockers have managed to keep a lid on distractions to their process-driven mantra.\n\nThey've contended with a long-term injury to star midfielder Hayden Young and a frustrating lay-off for captain Alex Pearce, as well as the retirements of two of the greatest to pull on purple in Michael Walters and Nat Fyfe.\n\nWhere Nat Fyfe ranks among WA's AFL greats Photo shows A mid shot of Dockers captain Nat Fyfe handballing a football wearing his white Fremantle jersey. As Nat Fyfe announces his retirement, Tom Wildie examines whether the Fremantle Dockers champion gets a spot on the Mount Rushmore of AFL-era players from WA.\n\nLongmuir's response to whether winning a flag would be the perfect send-off for Fyfe encapsulated how dialled in the Dockers are.\n\n\"Some of that talk is the talk that probably takes you away from what you need to do,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Fyfey summarised it really well the other day in his speech ... you just need to live in the moment and win every day.\"\n\nFremantle fans could be forgiven not getting ahead of themselves despite the Dockers lofty ladder position.\n\nBurned into the psyche is last year's capitulation, which saw them fall from third to 10th in the final four games of the season, which understandably has fans a little distrustful.\n\nMathematically, and certainly not beyond the realms of possibility, the Dockers could still miss finals in 2025.\n\nJustin Longmuir has copped plenty of criticism this season, but the Dockers are in fourth spot with two rounds to play. (AAP Image: James Ross)\n\nTheir final two matches pit them against the Lions and the Western Bulldogs, who are ninth and still scrapping for a spot in September.\n\nBut this young Dockers squad, and yes they are still young despite a lot of games played, has shown a steel and resolve they haven't previously.\n\nFinals, and top four, is theirs to lose, but current form suggests they have the mettle to get the job done.\n\nA win at home in front of a packed house will go a long way to sealing the deal.\n\nUnwanted history beckons\n\nWhile Fremantle looks upwards, so does West Coast, and not because they are close to the top.\n\nBecause there are no other clubs to look down on.\n\nAndrew McQualter's first full season as a head coach looms as being one of the worst seen in the AFL era. (AAP Image: Richard Wainwright)\n\nThe Eagles were gutsy in their loss to Adelaide at Perth Stadium, but it was a blip rather than a trend.\n\nWith two games remaining the Eagles have posted just one win for the season, and it's doubtful they will add a second.\n\nDockers great shares ideas on how AFL's worst performing team can rebuild Photo shows West Coast Eagles players standing following a match, as a presentation goes on West Coast should consider spending beyond the club's salary soft-cap to fast track its rebuild, according to former Fremantle captain Peter Bell.\n\nSince the AFL era began in 1990, only three teams have finished with just one win \u2014 Sydney in 1993, Fitzroy in 1996 and GWS in 2013.\n\nThrough the middle of the season, the wooden-spooners showed signs Andrew McQualter's method was getting through to the playing squad.\n\nDespite just the one win, the Eagles hung in against Geelong, pushed Collingwood and Carlton, and fell just short of beating fellow strugglers North Melbourne.\n\nBut the wheels have since fallen off \u2014 thrashed by Richmond, Fremantle and Melbourne in consecutive weeks.\n\nThe Eagles have challenges across the board, including the likely departure of co-captain Oscar Allen, and the uncertain future of emerging star Harley Reid.\n\nAdd to that the suspension of the other co-captain Liam Duggan for the remaining two games, and the season can't finish fast enough.\n\nMcQualter must already be planning for next season, in which he'll be hoping Jake Waterman is fit, Reid is firing, and his youngsters have put in a big off-season.\n\nThe Eagles have won just one game all season, against St Kilda in round 10. (AAP Image: Richard Wainwright)\n\nThere could also be a hint to who may lead the club in 2026 \u2014 Liam Baker, in his first season at the club and hot favourite to be best and fairest, will captain the side for games against the Western Bulldogs and Sydney.\n\nThe Eagles could do worse then put him in the role full-time next year.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "A regional South Australian soccer player has made the rare leap onto the European stage, signing a professional contract at the age of 18.\n\nMount Gambier midfielder Bae Versace has signed with FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica in the capital of Montenegro, after several years in Adelaide United's system.\n\nThe European club's senior team has won six Montenegrin First League championships, with its youth side taking part in the UEFA Youth League alongside the continent's best teams including Barcelona, Liverpool and Real Madrid.\n\nVersace said heading over to Europe had been more of a dream than a goal for him.\n\n\"I was just focused on playing at Adelaide United and trying to make my debut there,\" he said.\n\n\" But when an offer comes from Europe you don't want to turn it down because you might not get that opportunity again. \"\n\nVersace started his career with Inter SC in Mount Gambier when he was 8. (Supplied: Mark Versace)\n\nVersace said he was settling into life in the Balkans.\n\n\"Food and language are definitely the main two I'm getting used to,\" he said.\n\n\"I came here and had people greeting me out the front of the club and had meetings with the club. And the boys have all been very good to me.\"\n\nLong path to Europe\n\nVersace played a season as a junior at International Soccer Club in Mount Gambier before moving to MetroStars in Adelaide and being selected in United's junior teams.\n\nMelbourne-based coach Neb Stojkovic worked with Versace from a young age and helped him secure trials in Europe.\n\n\"For them, football is a way of living \u2026 so they do it with a purpose and everyone is fighting for that next level, and that contract, in the seniors,\" he said.\n\n\"For Bae it's a great opportunity to measure himself.\"\n\nNick Morony was one of Versace's coaches when he played for Inter's under-12s at just eight years old.\n\n\"He lived and breathed everything soccer,\" he said.\n\n\" When he wasn't doing homework he was out kicking the soccer ball or working on some of the drills we used to do. \"\n\nInter SC players Nick Morony, Matthew Bueti and Caleb Casey at the club's home, Casadio Park. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nImproving opportunities for regions\n\nVersace is thought to be the second Mount Gambier-born player to crack the European game after ex-Socceroo Josip Skoko, who started playing in the town before moving to Geelong at the age of nine.\n\nVersace said his young career showed country athletes had paths to become professionals.\n\n\"I don't think they have to look up to me in any way, but I don't see why they can't make the high levels,\" he said.\n\nVersace developed in Adelaide United's youth system. (Supplied: Mark Versace)\n\nMr Stojkovic said federations and coaches should work together to improve talent identification for regional players.\n\n\"We should go out and dig for them, they should not be short of opportunities,\" he said.\n\nFootball SA Limestone Coast regional development officer Nathan Koopman said federations were working to improve the pathways.\n\n\"If we find a player that's of a level to go higher we know we can have them [initiating] conversations and building relationships with coaches in the city,\" he said.\n\n\"When they do make that call to relocate they can then do it with a bit of confidence.\n\n\"Of course it's very exciting to look at the best players in the world and their stories as inspiration, but I think it's just as valuable \u2014 if not more so \u2014 to be able to speak to someone who came from your town, that they can see this is possible.\"",

    "text": "Speaking about the record on the podcast, Swift said it was like \u201ccatching lightning in a bottle\u201d. She produced it in Europe during the Eras Tour, as a way to capture what was happening behind the scenes during the tour \u2013 what her \u201cinner life\u201d was like off-stage. It consists of some of her favourite songs she has ever recorded, she said. \u201cI was in Europe on the Eras Tour ... I\u2019d have three days off, I\u2019d fly to Sweden, and go back to the tour while actually working on this. I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour, but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted the album to feel like how my life felt. Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons, and you couldn\u2019t take one out, and it be the same album. It\u2019s just right. That kind of focus and discipline, keeping the bar that high, is something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time.\u201d\n\nReclaiming her masters Beyond the album news, she also touched on another momentous moment in her life recently: the reclamation of her masters in May, a moment that \u201cchanged her life\u201d. Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift appear on the New Heights podcast. Credit: YouTube \u201cIt\u2019s always been a huge thing for me. Since I was a teenager, I\u2019ve been actively saving up money to buy my music back,\u201d she said, adding that she \u201cdramatically fell to the floor\u201d when she found out she had finally managed to take ownership of her discography. \u201cThis will affect the rest of my life, and I think about this every day. But now, instead of it being like an intrusive thought that hurts me, it\u2019s: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this happened. How lucky am I?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe then shifted to the epic experience that was the Eras Tour, the highest-grossing concert tour in history during which she travelled to 51 cities across more than 600 days. The singer said she wouldn\u2019t change a thing about the tour \u2013 one where she was able to physically and mentally prepare for more than any of her previous global tours. \u201cI wanted it to [include] references that, I thought, were really high-concept and really high-value for fans, and for them to see things they hadn\u2019t necessarily seen before all in one concert,\u201d she said. Another promotional image for The Life of a Showgirl. Credit: Instagram \u201cBut I wanted to do it at the highest intensity, rapid fire \u2013 you\u2019re seeing something new every 15 to 30 seconds. So, it feels like you\u2019re scrolling in an algorithm, right? \u201cWhen I heard reports of people saying that they got actual amnesia after the concerts, I was like: \u2018Oh, I think we did it. I think we nailed it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAustralia and the Eras Tour One of her favourite parts of the Eras Tour, she said, was the unplanned moments and fan-led traditions. Taylor Swift performing at the Eras Tour in Melbourne. Credit: Getty For example, during the European leg, her audience collectively decided to bring in balloons, which they illuminated with their phone torches during the Willow segment, reflecting the orbs held on-stage. \u201cWas there a group text? How did you guys even do this? It was so special. It felt like we were all part of something together in a way that couldn\u2019t be planned. As much as I love and relish in planning, it was really fun that they would do things to delight me,\u201d Swift said.\n\nLoading Australia also got a direct mention, with the pop juggernaut describing the country as \u201camazing\u201d. Despite how fulfilling the tour was, the pop star admitted she\u2019s now enjoying a break \u2013 time she is apparently using to bake endless loaves of sourdough bread and watching otter videos with her boyfriend. An FYI on Easter eggs Before the official announcement of the new album, fans scoured a litany of Easter eggs carefully planted by the star, including cryptic photo galleries and intentionally timed social media posts.\n\nSwift touched on the very puzzles she used to share the recent news on the podcast, joking that the \u201cEaster egg thing is getting a little Zodiac Killer at this point\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life \u2013 it\u2019s always going to be towards music,\u201d she said. The singer is famed for dropping cheeky hints for her fans to deduce. Credit: Instagram \u201cI want Easter eggs to be a certain thing where if you are part of the fandom, and you want to experience music in a normal way, then you don\u2019t even see these \u2013 you don\u2019t even care what that thing is above that doorway, under that dimly lit, flickering light over there that\u2019s upside-down, backwards in Braille. But if you want to look at that, you can. If you know, you know.\u201d Despite general excitement around the album itself, Swift\u2019s decision to share the news on the Kelce brothers\u2019 podcast divided fans. On one hand, some Swifties applauded the podcast approach, arguing that it was the ideal way for the singer to reveal the news on her own terms, rather than those of powerful, large-scale media or entertainment organisations.",

    "text": "Though Fernandes noted that no player on the eve of the season would describe his manager in anything other than glowing terms \u2013 much less him with a fellow Portuguese \u2013 he seems completely genuine in his praise. The 30-year-old says he sees the game in the same way as Amorim, credits him with improving his personal output, and is grateful he has the \u201cbig balls\u201d needed to make the decisions that could shape the club\u2019s future. \u201cI can see something good coming for the team,\u201d he said. Bruno Fernandes after Manchester United\u2019s Europa League final defeat. Credit: Getty Images This season is a fresh start in a number of ways. Firstly, it\u2019s the first full one for Amorim, who took over in November after a disastrous start led to Erik ten Hag\u2019s sacking. Amorim could not arrest the slide which led to United\u2019s 16th-placed finish, their worst since 1989-90. He did get them into the Europa League final, but they lost the chance at a shortcut into the UEFA Champions League when they fell 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur, on a night when their limitations in attack were clear for all to see.\n\nThat\u2019s hopefully been addressed. Amorim has used his first true opportunity to dive into the transfer market by bringing in a new frontline: two wingers with plenty of EPL experience in Mathias Cunha, from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Bryan Mbuemo, from Brentford, either side of big Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s most exciting young strikers \u2013 from RB Leipzig. \u201cPutting them three together with everything we had already from last season will give big competition to everyone, and everyone will be fighting for their position into the team,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cYou just have to start strong again. At Manchester United, time doesn\u2019t exist. You have to do it now.\u201d Bruno Fernandes And Fernandes is still around, too. He was the subject of an eye-watering offer from Al Hilal, who were reportedly prepared to pay over $200 million to get him \u2013 a huge transfer fee for a player his age \u2013 and almost triple his $500,000-per-week wages. \u201cI know numbers matter the most in football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously it was a big number that the club could get for me. So I know how tough it was for the club. When I spoke with the president of Al Hilal, I spoke with him once and I told him, \u2018I\u2019ve never thought about leaving, I appreciate your call. Whatever you want to do or not, you can talk with the club,\u2019 because I\u2019ve always said if the club wanted to sell me, then yes, I had to make a decision. But if the club doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t have to make a decision, because my aim is to stay here. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money for me, too, but it is what it is. People make decisions in their lives. I won\u2019t regret it because this is the place I want to be and this is the place where I want to be successful also.\u201d Manchester United\u2019s renovated training facility underlines the sense of a fresh start this season. Credit: Getty Images Last week, renovations of United\u2019s training facilities were completed. When the Carrington Training Complex first opened in 2000, they were state of the art \u2013 but as the years ticked by, they became dark, dingy and outdated, and a metaphor for how their standards had slipped. Three years ago, in his infamous interview with Piers Morgan, Cristiano Ronaldo described them as frozen in time; according to reports, he wouldn\u2019t even use the main swimming pool because it had chipped and cracked tiles he deemed a hazard to player safety. Now, thanks to a $100 million redevelopment, Carrington is best-in-class again, and the most tangible manifestation of part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s ambitions for the club. The slick new facility includes the latest technology to assist player recovery (altitude chambers, underwater treadmills and the like), plus some pretty cool lounges for the team to hang out in (including a barber shop and an F1 simulator), which all adds to the sense of a new beginning, and of a club seeking to regain its rightful place on top of the pile \u2013 although for Fernandes, it\u2019s the little things that could make the biggest difference.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Sir Jim spoke about was the natural light into the building,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a small detail, a small thing that could make such a big difference for the people that work here, because they have to be here for a very long time and for them to be closed in a space where they can\u2019t see natural light is very difficult. People that work in the office, they always talk about this, that brings more sadness and not as a good environment to work [in]. Also for our physios, for our staff, it\u2019s going to be a much nicer space for them to be working with.\u201d So that\u2019s the building sorted. What about the rebuild of the team? That\u2019s ongoing and, at the same time, overdue. It\u2019s no longer possible for a fallen giant like United to return to the top of the Premier League without enduring a period of pain on the ascent. But how can they do that in a world of unrealistic expectations and supporter impatience, at a club that still holds global attention like no other? \u201cExpectations at this club are always high,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you rebuild or not. Manchester United has no time to rebuild. You just have to start strong again. That\u2019s all. No one will be saying that you need to rebuild. At Manchester United, time doesn\u2019t exist. You have to do it now.",

    "text": "4. Fountain of youth A decade of AFLW has built a genuine pipeline for talent. Girls who once dreamed of playing footy can now start in Auskick, progress through junior pathways and land on an AFLW list. The difference is clear \u2013 these players arrive at the elite level hardened, skilled and fearless. Watch Ash Centra at Collingwood or Havanna Harris at Gold Coast, and you\u2019ll see ready-made footballers. Then there are the rising stars who\u2019ve already made their mark \u2013 Matilda Scholz (Port Adelaide), last year\u2019s mark of the year winner, and Montana Ham (Sydney), whose presence and game-winning ability grow every season. These players aren\u2019t just the future \u2013 they\u2019re already reshaping the present. When I was growing up, I looked to St Kilda\u2019s Lenny Hayes as my childhood hero, but now you and your family can have a genuine female superstar to follow from any of the 18 clubs. 5. It starts at the top This season\u2019s coaches are a fascinating mix of tactical nous and lived experience. Former AFL names such as Rhyce Shaw (Gold Coast), Toby McLean (Bulldogs), Ben Brown (Essendon), and Brendan Fevola (Richmond) bring with them the sharpness and strategy of the men\u2019s game \u2013 Fevola even declaring Ellie McKenzie the best kick he\u2019s seen in either competition. There\u2019s also the influence of AFLW pioneers now moving into coaching, such as Daisy Pearce at West Coast and Lauren Arnell at Port Adelaide. And don\u2019t forget Darren Crocker at North Melbourne, who knows a thing or two about winning, having played in a premiership side in 1996. These voices are shaping a faster, more sophisticated brand of AFLW footy.\n\n6. Fastest-growing female sport The numbers tell the story: since the AFLW began, female participation in footy has exploded by nearly 200 per cent, from 42,000 players to more than 125,000. More than 2500 new women\u2019s and girls\u2019 teams have sprung up around the country, and the AFL is now the largest employer of female athletes nationwide. Every girl who laces up her boots today has a clearer, straighter path to the elite level than ever before, and AFLW is the stage where those dreams can become reality. When you watch, you\u2019re not just seeing a game \u2013 you\u2019re seeing the result of a generational shift. Our newest draftees started their pathway when they were eight or nine years old \u2014 10 years ago!

Community heartbeat AFLW still has something the men\u2019s competition has mostly lost: the community feel that makes you feel part of the game, not just a spectator. Many games are played at local grounds, where you can stand on the boundary, hear the on-field calls, and be close enough to see the players\u2019 facial expressions. It\u2019s football in its purest form \u2013 close to the action, surrounded by families and fans, with a post-match kick-to-kick on the oval. For those who love the romance of suburban footy, AFLW is a time machine back to the game\u2019s grassroots charm. Head down to Arden Street, back to the Kennel, or off to Moorabbin to take a time warp in the best possible way.\n\n8. Milestones with meaning This year, some of the league\u2019s trailblazers are closing in on 100 games, all consecutive. In the men\u2019s competition, 100 games is a solid achievement; in AFLW, it\u2019s monumental. Shorter seasons mean it has taken almost a decade to reach, and these players have carried the league through its formative years \u2013 playing in the heat of summer, the chill of winter, and often in front of smaller crowds before the momentum built. Every milestone game this season will be a celebration not just of individual endurance, but of the resilience of the entire competition. Watch out for Ebony Marinoff (Adelaide) and Ally Anderson (Brisbane Lions) to be the first ones to hit it. Me and Bre Koenon (Brisbane Lions) are currently two games behind them on 91. This is the equivalent of a man playing 250 consecutive games in the AFL \u2013 a feat only reached by greats such as Jim Stynes and Jack Crisp. AFLW star Ebony Marinoff. Credit: AFL Photos 9. A welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere At AFLW games, the footy is fierce, but the atmosphere is warm. Tickets are affordable, seating is relaxed, and the stands are filled with people of all ages and backgrounds. It\u2019s a space where kids can see their heroes up close, where parents don\u2019t have to worry about rowdy crowds, and where first timers are embraced as quickly as long-time members. It\u2019s the game you love, wrapped in a sense of community and belonging that\u2019s hard to find anywhere else. There are always plenty of activities for kids to enjoy, and the surroundings are really intimate.\n\nLoading 10. Every supporter helps grow the game AFLW is still building, and every eyeball, every ticket, every shout from the boundary line matters. Growth in crowds and TV audiences directly strengthens the league\u2019s ability to push for longer seasons, better pay and greater exposure. The current target is moving from 12 games a year to 14, and eventually to a full home-and-away fixture. The more support we give now, the sooner that vision becomes reality \u2013 for today\u2019s players and for every young girl dreaming of one day pulling on an AFLW jumper. What\u2019s exciting is that many of our men\u2019s heroes now have children, often girls, and many of these will play for your club under the father-daughter rule. Imagine watching a mini Matthew Richardson kick a goal for the Tigers after a lace-out kick from one of Trent Cotchin\u2019s daughters! Ten reasons are more than enough. Now it\u2019s over to you to vote with your feet and by watching on TV. This season is shaping up to be the best we\u2019ve ever seen, and we want you there with us. Come and watch us play, follow your team\u2019s journey, and join in the fun from the first bounce to the final siren. Every cheer from the stands, every clap, every new face in the crowd helps us grow the game and inspire the next generation. It\u2019s not the intimidating noise of 100,000 bullish people at the MCG, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For Rebecca F. Kuang, the easiest way to resist the internet is to carry a phone that won\u2019t cooperate. It doesn\u2019t glow, buzz, or beg for her attention \u2013 and she prefers it that way. It\u2019s a statement of defiance against the glowing promise that apps would make us more connected and productive. Instead, Kuang says, they\u2019ve shredded attention spans and left us more alone than ever. \u201cMy phone\u2019s basically a brick. It can\u2019t access most apps,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople can\u2019t send me TikTok links. I can never see them. Of course, a lot of stuff is going to get caught in the net, but on the whole, it\u2019s great because I spend so much more time reading and writing and cooking and being grounded in the world around me and very little time online.\u201d No X, no TikTok, no doom spiral of headlines \u2013 a notable abstinence, given the starring role the internet played in her bestselling 2023 novel Yellowface, a razor-edged literary satire about a struggling white writer who swipes the manuscript and identity of her dead Chinese friend, only to face the wrath of the online mob. Rebecca Kuang photographed at the Boston Public Library. Credit: Ben Sklar \u201cThat was my internet novel. It was really me getting the internet out of my system. I\u2019m actually pretty extreme about digital minimalism,\u201d Kuang, who publishes as R.F. Kuang, says. \u201cI knew I was never going to write a book like Yellowface again because that just was not a sustainable way for me to be in the world, so I felt like this freedom to do whatever I wanted with the next book. It will probably appeal to a different set of readers, and that\u2019s exciting to me, like I\u2019m tired of talking about Yellowface.\u201d Kuang is in her husband Bennett Eckert-Kuang\u2019s study in their Boston home when we speak over video \u2013 not her natural habitat. Enclosed spaces, she explains, feel stifling; she prefers to work somewhere open, where the air can move and the light can spill in. But today, the fading light cuts across her face, artfully preparing us for the shadows of her new novel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYellowface looks down on delegates at the publisher\u2019s stand during the first day of the London Book Fair in 2023. Credit: In Pictures via Getty Images If you haven\u2019t read Yellowface, you\u2019ve almost certainly seen it \u2013 the bold, winking yellow cover staring back at you from bookshop tables and BookTok. Inside, Kuang skewers the publishing industry and the chronically online mindset with a scalpel and a smirk: taking on how technology has rewired the way we consume art, perform outrage, and weaponise accountability. It\u2019s been optioned for a scripted television series with Karyn Kusama (The Invitation, Yellowjackets, Girlfight) attached to direct. While Yellowface was strikingly topical and opened the door to a wider readership, Kuang had already been forging her path through the searing landscapes of historical fantasy with The Poppy War trilogy (2018\u20132020) and Babel (2022). Drawing on mid-20th-century Chinese history and begun when she was just 19, The Poppy War was no overnight success \u2013 Kuang admits she initially felt \u201csick to my stomach\u201d every time she thought about sales \u2013 but word of mouth gradually built momentum. Meanwhile, Babel, set in 1830s England, became a BookTok hit. This steady rise meant, Kuang says, the sudden attention from Yellowface never \u201cmessed me up\u201d. Rebecca Kuang attends the 2023 TIME100 Next in 2023. Credit: Getty Images As she critiqued publishing\u2019s pigeonholing of authors in Yellowface, Kuang herself refuses to be confined by genre or expectation. Almost as soon as she penned the novel, Kuang admits she was bored with the frenetic, internet-fuelled tone that is omnipresent in today\u2019s literary landscape \u2013 eager instead to explore new territories, both thematically and stylistically, in her work. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m still very young, and I want room to grow, so to be typecast now would feel stifling and murderous to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think there is this sort of resistant delight to defying categorisation because when you are pretty overtly racialised or gendered, as so many people are, you do always want to be acting out against expectation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat resentment of expectation is not what drives me. It\u2019s just something I find psychologically interesting about myself. What drives me is wanting to evolve as an artist with every project.\u201d I think it never got to my head or messed me up because I\u2019m really good at moving on to the next project. She\u2019s also grown wary of publishing\u2019s other obsession \u2013 youth. In a recent piece for Time headlined Olivia Rodrigo and the Impossible Pressure to Stay a Prodigy, Kuang, 29, reflects on the pressure of being \u201cyoung\u201d in the literary world. The scepticism that has met her, the interest in her age rather than work, and the anxiety that the apex of her career might have come and gone. \u201cIt\u2019s really stupid, I think, that we are so obsessed with young authors in literature. Literature is one of the one things that you only get better at as you get older,\u201d Kuang says. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not in my prime. I hope that my prime is decades away.\u201d Kuang might not realise it yet, given her self-imposed social media ban, but her readers are already gearing up for her sixth novel out this month. Roll your eyes at BookTokers if you like, but they\u2019re busily assembling reading lists heavy with Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and Dante as they prepare for the release of Katabasis \u2013 a richly layered, genre-bending dive into the underworld. (The title comes from the Greek word meaning \u201cdescent\u201d). Rebecca Kuang\u2019s new novel, Katabasis, plays with classic texts about the afterlife. Credit: Ben Sklar In Katabasis, Cambridge doctoral student Alice Law and her nemesis Peter Murdoch wield pentagram magic to descend into the Eight Courts of Hell, all in a desperate bid to rescue their professor\u2019s soul \u2013 without him, their crucial recommendation letter is lost. The novel deftly plays with the classical stages of the underworld journey \u2013 the descent, the ordeal, and the return (anabasis) \u2013 while tipping its hat to Alice in Wonderland, T.S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land, and even drawing from the surreal dreamscapes of Dali.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re counting subgenres, it\u2019s a clever mashup of dark academia and historical fantasy, with an enemies-to-lovers twist. And while this might seem underworlds apart from Yellowface, Kuang is as critical as ever, cutting through the pretension, privilege, and politics of academia. If Babel\u2019s Oxford setting allowed an examination of the institution\u2019s historical role as a facilitator of imperial projects, Katabasis focuses on the interpersonal \u2013 the inflated egos, the skewed priorities and values, and the fraught, often toxic, relationships between students and teachers. \u201cI think of them as a duology that deals with why I love the academy so much and can\u2019t step away but why I am increasingly uncomfortable with it,\u201d Kuang says, perfectly placed to say so, having roamed some of the world\u2019s most elite academic halls. From her undergraduate years at Georgetown University to graduate degrees at Cambridge and Oxford, she\u2019s now teaching and finishing a PhD in sinology at Yale. Her research spans Chinese-language literature and Asian American writing, focusing on Chinese American and Chinese diaspora authors and their explorations of travel, language, geography, and storytelling. Kuang \u2013 who was born in Guangzhou, China, moved with her parents to Dallas, Texas, when she was four \u2013 grew up in a household that valued literature highly and was always drawn to fantasy. Rebecca Kuang says she enjoys defying expectations when it comes to genres and styles. Credit: Ben Sklar She started her PhD the same year as her husband, who\u2019s pursuing philosophy at MIT, started his. They recently celebrated their first anniversary. While some couples spend their evenings arguing over whether a potato is too far gone to cook for dinner, theirs seems to involve lively debates on logic paradoxes and the quirks of rational decision-making, conversations about which inspired Katabasis. \u201cI just fell in love with the idea of logic paradoxes, especially paradoxes of rational decision-making, which feels very pertinent to how we live our lives,\u201d Kuang says. \u201cThere are so many paradoxes where you make a series of decisions that seem like you\u2019re better off at every stage, and then suddenly you find yourself in a far worse position than you anticipated, with no way to claw out of it. And that seemed like a lovely way to describe being in a PhD program.\u201d Rebecca Kuang has been writing novels since she was 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKuang\u2019s academic and creative worlds have never been separate \u2013 they flow into one another. Her novels are set on campuses or in educational institutions, and weave in her scholarly pursuits. Her advisors often remind her to rein in her signature point of view, reminding her she\u2019s writing an essay, not fiction. \u201cI find it very difficult to keep the creative voice from seeping into my academic work. I\u2019m always having conversations with my advisor about how my academic writing needs to be a little less opinionated and have a little less of that spunk and flair that I like to bring to my fiction prose.\u201d Having reached new heights after Yellowface, Kuang could now write full-time. When asked why she hasn\u2019t stepped away from academia, the answer is simple: \u201cI like it.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m still very young, and I want room to grow, so to be typecast now would feel stifling and murderous to me. \u201cI wish I had a more sophisticated answer than that, but I think I\u2019m in a lucky position where I have multiple career options. I could be a full-time author, I could be a full-time academic, and I just enjoy both too much to give either of them up. I always tell myself, the moment it stops being engaging, I\u2019ll step away,\u201d Kuang says. \u201cFor all that is frustrating and broken about academia, I\u2019m still committed to this core promise of inquiry and curiosity and sharing it with others, and I do still regularly feel that when I step into a classroom.\u201d She didn\u2019t feel the weight of expectation after Yellowface \u2013 no sudden compulsion to chase its sharp success or bottle its biting style. Instead, she slipped quietly into her next chapter, boarding a flight to Taipei to plunge straight into research for a new book.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Entering Sydney\u2019s largest underground rail cavern, you are struck by a mass of blue-coloured waterproof lining that covers its walls and ceiling. At 28 metres wide and 180 metres long, the size of the cavern built beneath the northern end of central Sydney for the $25.3 billion Metro West line is breathtaking. Yet what is not obvious is how close it comes to buildings, existing rail tunnels and critical power cables for the CBD. Illustrating the challenge for contractors, the top of the cavern sits just six metres below the foundations of a 169-year-old heritage hotel built from sandstone. Once opened in 2032, the Hunter Street metro station will become the hub for train travel in and out of the northern part of the CBD. It will connect existing heavy rail and metro stations at Martin Place to Wynyard, allowing people to switch between multiple lines without setting foot above ground. The size of the cavern for the Metro West station beneath Hunter Street is breathtaking. Credit: Steven Siewert It will be bigger than both Victoria Cross station in North Sydney and the Martin Place metro station, which is the busiest on the M1 line between the city\u2019s north-west and Sydenham. The reason for its size is simple. While it is forecast to handle 10,000 passengers an hour when it opens in 2032, the only station in the CBD for Metro West is being built for a staggering 40,000 people an hour. Sydney Metro chief executive Peter Regan said the station was being built to be bigger than others to cater for the \u201cvery large volume of people\u201d entering and exiting at the same time, and major growth over coming decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe complexity of what you\u2019re seeing down in that cavern is like nothing we\u2019ve done before in terms of the scale of what is being built under the city. It will become the biggest rail cavern in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cHunter Street will be a very busy station because it\u2019s the end of the line, and it\u2019s the only station in the CBD [for Metro West].\u201d In comparison, the M1 line has four stations in the central city \u2013 Barangaroo, Martin Place, Gadigal and Central \u2013 which means passenger loads during the peak periods are spread, instead of concentrated on one. Initially, six-carriage driverless trains will run on the 24-kilometre line between Parramatta and the CBD every four minutes in each direction. However, the 180-metre-long stations on the Metro West line allow for trains as long as eight carriages to eventually be operated. \u201cIt\u2019s designed very much to grow as a station,\u201d Regan said. A tunnel that will connect the existing Martin Place metro station to the new Hunter Street station for Metro West. Credit: Steven Siewert Hunter and Pyrmont stations construction manager Dave Maytom said one of the challenges was the wide span of the cavern and the fact that it was, on average, only about 10 metres beneath the surface. \u201cThat is very shallow. To create a large hole, you need a body of rock to support itself above that cavern,\u201d he said, explaining that to provide support a type of concrete known as shotcrete up to half a metre thick was applied. \u201cWorking in that city environment is hugely challenging.\u201d About 28,000 tonnes of concrete have been poured to form the cavern floor, leaving more than a third of its construction completed. Excavation of the cavern and most of the connecting tunnels was finished in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo giant boring machines are due to break through into the cavern by the end of the year, which will complete twin tunnels between the Bays precinct at Rozelle and the CBD. It will mark a shift for the mega project from digging tunnels and giant holes to building and fitting out stations, as well as the laying of rail tracks and installation of vital equipment. At the western end of the cavern beneath Hunter Street, three giant concrete pillars serve as structural supports for the roof, and will be where three tunnels each about eight metres wide will enter, one of which will be for passengers. Saint Barbara, who is patron saint of tunnellers and engineers, has watched over excavation of the subterranean cathedral-like cavern. Credit: Steven Siewert At the eastern end, a giant shaft is being dug from street level into the cavern. It will serve as the other entrance to the station. Passengers will make their way down via banks of escalators and lifts to a concourse level, before taking another set of escalators to the platforms. The forecast volume of passengers is such that Sydney Metro, a government agency, is considering widening a pedestrian link under George Street between Wynyard station and the western end of Hunter Street station. A direct pedestrian link will be built between the Hunter Street station concourse and the platform level at the existing Martin Place metro station. Importantly, passengers will not need to pass through ticket gates to walk between the two. Transport Minister John Graham said the station would be at the middle of an underground spiderweb of connections in the CBD. \u201cIt will open up direct connectivity to every metro line and every train line without ever having to go above ground to cross a street,\u201d he said. \u201c[It] is an engineering feat of which the numbers tell the story of its scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

One nurse in South Melbourne replied nine minutes later, offering to supply the drug that day.\n\n\u201cVery unethical, I know,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I am open over the Christmas/New Year period and have been left with nothing as the past week we have been inundated. I thought I had enough stock. Please don\u2019t judge me.\u201d\n\nThe owner of a Geelong skin clinic was frantically trying to buy anti-wrinkle drugs from her peers, an act prohibited under Australian medication laws.\n\nAt 7.48am on Christmas Day in 2020, a desperate plea pinged in a WhatsApp group for nurses subscribing to Australia\u2019s largest cosmetic injectables telehealth company.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone have two vials of Botox I could buy off them? I have 3 days left in clinic before going away for 3 months and don\u2019t want to leave anything sitting in my fridge,\u201d said another in an April 2023 exchange.\n\nReplies arrived within minutes \u2013 offers to help out from Melbourne suburbs Frankston, Williams Landing and Blackburn.\n\n\u201cHey guys! Anyone have a spare vial (Dysport or Botox) I can grab asap?\u201d a Melbourne-based nurse wrote in December 2023. \u201cI\u2019m willing to travel anywhere in Melbourne. I\u2019ve already ordered but it didn\u2019t come on time for my patients tomorrow! Would appreciate it heaps.\u201d\n\nRequests were often met with near-instant offers, highlighting how quickly supply could be sourced through the informal networks.\n\nThe WhatsApp messages used varied terminology \u2014 buy, borrow, sell, grab \u2013 but the effect was the same: restricted drugs changing hands outside formal supply channels, arranged via encrypted group chats.\n\nUnder Australian law these Schedule 4 drugs can only be supplied by licensed wholesalers to authorised prescribers or pharmacists, to safeguard patient safety and control the movement of drugs.\n\nFresh Clinics does not directly employ the nurses working in the injectables clinics. The clinics are independent businesses which pay a subscription to Fresh Clinics to access doctors and medicines.\n\nA NSW Health spokesman likewise said the medications could only be obtained by an authorised practitioner and could not be resupplied.\n\nAsked to respond to the messages, a Victorian Health Department spokeswoman said: \u201cThe trading of Schedule 4 medicines between clinics is not lawful.\u201d\n\nAs telehealth fuels the expansion of Australia\u2019s booming $4 billion injectables industry, regulators are scrambling to roll out changes to protect patients.\n\nOther nurses offered to sell stock they no longer needed: \u201cI made an order in error \u2013 would anyone like to buy some Botox?\u201d a nurse wrote in June 2023. \u201cI can grab some off you,\u201d another replied. \u201cYes pls!\u201d added a third quickly.\n\nIn one November 2023 exchange, a nurse asked: \u201cHi team, does anyone stock [cosmetic filler] Sculptra? Can I buy one off you please?\u201d The co-owner of Fresh Clinics, John Holbrook, responds: \u201cYou can\u2019t on-sell it. But we can assist to move it across clinics.\u201d\n\nUnder the Fresh Clinics model, nurses, operating as independent businesses, consult with clients, then request a remote video review by a Fresh Clinics doctor, who issues a script. The nurse administers the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese communications illustrate an unlawful black market for prescription-only cosmetic medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system loses integrity, meaning that any harmed patients will struggle to obtain a remedy.\u201d\n\nDr Christopher Rudge, a lecturer in health practitioner law at the University of Sydney, reviewed the WhatsApp messages and said they illustrated unlawful trading and created an untraceable supply chain.\n\n\u201cFresh Clinics ensures that all stock transfers between clinics comply with the latest federal and state regulations,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nThere is no suggestion Fresh Clinics has broken the law, and in a statement it said it had done nothing wrong.\n\nFresh Clinics staff were aware of this. In March 2022 the company\u2019s clinical director replied to a nurse post: \u201cThese can\u2019t be onsold \u2026 onselling of a schedule medication is illegal.\u201d\n\nFederal law prohibits the unauthorised sale or transfer of Schedule 4 medicines. Prescription-only drugs must be distributed by licensed wholesalers to authorised practitioners, not traded peer to peer.\n\nIn March this year, this masthead revealed that some Fresh Clinics doctor consultations lasted as little as 52 seconds before a script was approved. Following that investigation, new rules released in June by Australia\u2019s health practitioner watchdog included tighter rules for first-time patients and restrictions on issuing high-speed telehealth scripts.\n\nThe model was designed for flexibility. But many doctors who practise in-person medicine argue it removes critical points of clinical oversight.\n\nFresh charges a per patient fee \u2013 usually $25 \u2013 and also leaves nurses to handle ordering, storage and administration of the medication.\n\nCo-founder John Delaney was more direct when fielding questions via a different WhatsApp forum in April this year: \u201cWholesalers can only sell to a doctor, nurse practitioner or pharmacist.\u201d\n\nYet elsewhere, other staff advised workarounds. In 2021, co-founder John Holbrook wrote to one nurse: \u201cHi [name removed], it\u2019s not legal for you guys to onsell medication. But [Fresh Clinics staffer] can help out seeing if there\u2019s somewhere that Dysport can be borrowed and replaced from.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cborrow and replace\u201d system was sometimes formalised, other times not. In one message, the company\u2019s head of clinical training advised a nurse: \u201cLet us know who you end up getting product from and we will invoice you and send out replacement to the nurse who loans the product.\u201d\n\nThe nurse responded: \u201cThanks so much, for sure \u2018sell\u2019 was probably the wrong word to use as I know you guys reimbursed the lender with product.\u201d\n\nAirtasker driver, Kmart Esky\n\nIt was May 2021, and a senior Fresh Clinics manager was on the hunt for a new delivery driver. She proposed the company \u201cload a new job every day onto Airtasker with the anticipated jobs for the day\u201d.\n\nThen, she posted a job on Airtasker for a driver to deliver for an \u201caesthetic supply company\u201d at $840 per week. \u201cOwn vehicle necessary,\u201d the ad said.\n\nThe job went to Shah, a part-time driver who also delivered auto spare parts. He told this masthead he didn\u2019t know what was in the boxes he would drop off to clinics, just that they were packed professionally.\n\n\u201cSome of them were very urgent, some weren\u2019t,\u201d said Shah, who declined to give his surname. \u201cI just put extra ice inside the Esky. So I had to get the ice \u2026 and I just put it in my car.\u201d\n\nA staff message to Shah from that time reads: \u201cHave you bought the Esky?\u201d Shah replied: \u201cBuying it now in Kmart Broadway.\u201d\n\nApproached about this and other issues raised in WhatsApp messages, the Therapeutic Goods Administration declined to comment, saying responsibility rested with states and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. That agency, in turn, referred queries to state health authorities.\n\nCosmetic physician Ronald Feiner, the medical dean of the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery and Medicine, said transporting botulinum toxin, commonly known by the brand name Botox, in an Esky put patient safety at risk.\n\nHe said the substance must be stored at stable, cold temperatures \u2013 usually between 2 to 8 degrees \u2013 in order to be effective. Improper handling could compromise product quality and increase the risk of infection and tissue damage, Feiner said.\n\n\u201cIt is way below standard and unacceptable,\u201d he said of the Esky transportation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t accept products transported in that manner and I wouldn\u2019t inject it into my patients. It is completely substandard.\u201d\n\nFeiner is also a co-ordinator at the International Master Course on Ageing Science, which hosts the world\u2019s leading cosmetic dermatology and plastic surgery meeting and reviews cosmetic complications lodged by doctors from around the world.\n\nHe said the group reviewed a complication linked to botulinum toxin around once a week, and always questioned whether the substance was stored and transported correctly.\n\n\u201cImproper storage may lead to product degradation, which can cause infections and tissue damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis damage can lead to depressions in the skin like little finger compressions.\u201d\n\nThis GIF of US TV host Stephen Colbert was posted in a chat between Fresh Clinics workers. Credit: Marija Ercegovac\n\nIn addition, he said botulinum toxin stored at incorrect temperatures might be ineffective or wear off more quickly.\n\nOther messages seen by this masthead showed Fresh Clinics staff sometimes also adopted a tone that minimised the seriousness of their work.\n\nIn a 2021 thread, the company\u2019s head of training posted a meme of American TV host Stephen Colbert waving oversized syringes, alongside a text discussing Fresh\u2019s $25 telehealth consults now possible via the company\u2019s app. Her caption: \u201cAnd we don\u2019t take any liability LOL.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange in one of the WhatsApp groups, when a nurse asked if unmixed Botox left out of the fridge could still be used, co-founder Holbrook responded: \u201cIt\u2019s good for use on yourself/family at a minimum.\u201d\n\nFresh Clinics goes political\n\nAs scrutiny of the injectables industry has intensified in recent years, Fresh Clinics has become more politically active. In May federal lobbying firm Barton Deakin registered as its lobbyist, followed in June by Hawker Britton. In July, PR agency Sling & Stone registered as its third Canberra lobbyist.\n\nResearcher Maddison Johnstone, from advocacy group Operation Redress, said the industry had undercut its own arguments about professionalism.\n\n\u201cIt seems the industry has dabbled in the very thing it purports to be against when it suits their commercial interests. Patients deserve better \u2013 they pay through the nose and trust licensed clinics are prioritising their safety.\u201d\n\nResearcher Maddison Johnstone. Credit: Paul Harris\n\nIn response to detailed questions from this masthead, a Fresh Clinics spokeswoman said the company\u2019s \u201cwell-connected network of nurses and doctors\u201d included \u201ca private WhatsApp community where we share industry insights, tips, trends and regulatory updates and requirements\u201d.\n\nShe said nurses co-ordinating stock transfers with doctor oversight \u201cis consistent with long-standing medical practices, with some stock transfers co-ordinated via private messaging platforms. Fresh Clinics ensures that all stock transfers between clinics comply with the latest federal and state regulations.\u201d\n\nShe said while some of the transfers appeared to be selling, swapping and trading, they were in fact not. \u201cWhile some members may use varying degrees of terminology, Fresh Clinics monitors this channel and corrects any misused language where possible.\u201d\n\nA NSW Health spokesman said that under the state\u2019s Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act, cosmetic medicines like botulinum toxin can only be bought by an authorised practitioner, such as a doctor or nurse practitioner.\n\nLoading\n\nHe stressed that these drugs \u201ccannot be resupplied to another clinic or authorised practitioner\u201d.\n\nThe NSW regulator warned that anyone suspected of breaking these laws would be investigated.\n\nAnd, just as in Victoria, which said trading Schedule 4 medicines between clinics was not lawful, a Queensland Health Department spokeswoman said: \u201c\u2018swapping\u2019 or \u2018borrowing\u2019 Schedule 4 medicines amounts to \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018supply\u2019, which is not permitted in Queensland unless authorised\u201d.\n\nDr Christopher Rudge, who also reviewed the messages, said the behaviour constituted professional misconduct that could lead to a tribunal revoking a practitioner\u2019s registration.\n\nA system built for speed \u2013 not scrutiny\n\nThe hundreds of WhatsApp screenshots seen by this masthead show clinic owners and nurses often operating with a sense of urgency to maintain supply.\n\nLoading\n\nAnd while senior staff at Fresh Clinics can be seen intervening on some exchanges to remind nurses not to on-sell products, the messages are otherwise devoid of references to bodies like the TGA and state health laws, or consulting pharmacists.\n\nThe Christmas Day message at the start of this story from the Geelong clinic owner, who this masthead attempted unsuccessfully to contact, still stands out: \u201cVery unethical, I know \u2026 Please don\u2019t judge me.\u201d\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

What that should be is a warning to the media to be very careful about the fact that Hamas will engage in propaganda.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Productivity Commission has released a number of proposals, including reformation of construction investment, a transition to cleaner energy and the use of Artificial Intelligence [[A-I]] to help ease teachers' workloads and improve education equality.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment data will be released tomorrow, which is used as a key indicator of the economy's performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Chalmers says he does not want to limit the scope of discussions next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a genuine attempt to try and build consensus around the suggestions that people might have for us, to agree on some reform directions for the government to do more work on.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAs telecommunications giant, Telstra, reports a major profit boost, its leadership are backing calls for a national digital infrastructure plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nTelstra's CEO, Vicky Brady addressed investors today, referencing recent Productivity Commission recommendations for the use of A-I, as she called on the Federal Government to coordinate its approach on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need the right policy and regulatory settings to make sure we can roll out large scale digital infrastructure projects more quickly and efficiently.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTelstra has posted a 2.34-billion-dollar profit for the past financial year, over thirty per cent higher than the previous 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company made major savings with thousands of job losses since mid-2024, including 5,500 job cuts announced in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations of sexual offences in the childcare sector have increased by almost 50 per cent, with advocates blaming cultural and regulatory failures in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nBody Safety Australia, which promotes childhoods free from violence, says there is a growing safety crisis in New South Wales, where more than 400,000 children attended a care service.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt cited a 47 per cent increase in sexual offence notifications to the New South Wales Office of the Children's Guardian between 2023-2024.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nBody Safety Australia lists several gaps offenders had taken advantage of, including workforce instability, inadequate training and qualifications, inconsistent oversight and confusing reporting frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nA warning that the following story contains the name of an Aboriginal person who has died, used with permission of his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nA funeral is being held today in Cowra for Wiradjuri Elder, activist and lawyer Paul Coe, who passed away in late July.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is being remembered for his dedication to improving the lives of First Nations people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in 1949, he grew up at the Erambie Mission in Cowra in central NSW on Wiradjuri Country before moving to Sydney in the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Coe was instrumental in establishing the Aboriginal Legal Service and was the first Aboriginal person to study law at the University of New South Wales becoming one of the first Indigenous barristers in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was 76 years old.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket Australia chief executive Todd Greenberg has warned some nations will go bankrupt if they continue to play the longest format of the game, stressing he sees a future with less Test nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenberg is calling for a lighter Test game schedule, to ensure the format remains viable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comments come after The International Cricket Council recently set up a working party to look at the Test format and ways to make it more viable.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenberg says less is more.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Young Australians may be vastly overestimating the amount of inheritance they expect to receive.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new survey from wealth management firm Colonial First State (CFS) found that younger Australians between the ages of 18 and 29 anticipate an inheritance of around $525,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey, which spoke to 2,250 Australians over the age of 18, found that young people's expectations were in line with those aged 40 to 49, who expected to inherit around $547,667.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Young people are hopeful about receiving financial support in the form of an inheritance due to rising living costs, stagnant wage growth and housing pressures ,\" CFS chief executive Kelly Power said.\n\n\n\nThe survey found that more younger people are expecting an inheritance, as housing affordability means many struggle to get onto the property market. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts However, the sum is nearly double the amount that older generations expect to receive, with the 65 to 74 age bracket anticipating around $167,624.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith trillions of dollars expected to be transferred via intergenerational wealth over the coming years, the data on who will receive that inheritance shows that younger Australians' expectations may not match up to the reality.\n\n\n\nWhere will 'the great wealth transfer' go?\n\nA Productivity Commission report from 2021 found that $1.5 trillion in wealth had been transferred in Australia in the past two decades, with around 90 per cent of that total in the form of inheritance. Some estimates suggest that $3.5 trillion more could be handed down in the coming decades .\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists call this 'the great wealth transfer'.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, younger generations aren't always the beneficiaries. Melbourne University's HILDA survey of household, income and labour dynamics found that most recipients of inherited wealth are over 55, receiving an average inheritance of $275,619.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Grudnoff, senior economist at the Australia Institute, says that young people are relying on an inheritance to get into the property market, a need \"born out of desperation\" .\n\n\n\nBaby boomers hold $4.9 trillion in assets according to CoreData analysis. Source: SBS News \"In the past, inheritance was a way of redistributing wealth, but increasingly wealth is being concentrated in smaller and smaller groups, so effectively this is going to flow to a very small minority of people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrudnoff said it's true that people tend to overestimate their inheritance, making guesses \"based on hope and not reality\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Council of Social Service 2024 Inequality Report found that income inequality is growing in Australia as the wealthiest 10 per cent of households possess 44 per cent of total wealth. Further, older households are more likely to have more wealth, with households aged 65+ being four times wealthier than households aged 35 and under .\n\n\n\nAdjusting inheritance expectations\n\nWhile there is no official data to confirm just how much wealth is being passed down, the Productivity Commission estimates the average inheritance is around $125,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HILDA survey also found that inheritances tend to be smaller for younger generations. It estimated that only 1.5 per cent of Australians between the ages of 25 and 34 received an inheritance, at an average amount of $50,508.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Inheritances are not going to be that large for most people,\" Grudnoff said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It might help you in your retirement, but I don't think it's going to radically change whether or not you can buy a house or help you through most of your life.\"\n\n\n\nThe CFS survey also found 82 per cent intended to leave an inheritance but only 38 per cent have a will.\n\n\n\n\n\nCFS head of technical services Craig Day said it's important that expectations are discussed openly among family members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By having these conversations early, families can ensure that everyone is on the same page and can make informed decisions that align with their values and goals,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just about passing on wealth \u2014 it's about passing on clarity. Families need to talk about their intentions, their needs, and their plans.\"\n\n\n\n",

First time I'm very scared. You know, after that, slowly, slowly, I'm better.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the head chef, she says it's been an empowering experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe leads a kitchen which donates meals to those in need, one in Sydney and one in Afghanistan for every meal sold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can look after my family and I work outside and independent. You know, I feel independent. It's so good for everyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis kind of initiative has been backed by the federal government and is now receiving a $120,000 grant.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Social Services Tanya Plibersek even had her own go at Afghan cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate it Forward, which runs Kabul Social, is just one of the organisations receiving funding aimed at helping marginalised communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Plibersek says it's hoped social enterprises like this will have a long-lasting impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to invest a small amount of money so these terrific organisations can help more people help themselves. We know the impact of intergenerational disadvantage, and we want to stop it by investing with refugee women, with First Nations communities, people with a disability. By investing early, helping them become financially self-sustaining, we know that we'll change their lives and we'll change the trajectory of their families' lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Hetherington is the CEO of Impact Investing Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says better employment outcomes help address the disadvantages experienced by marginalised communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to see the funders and the kind of supporting ecosystem, who makes it possible, get stronger and deeper and ultimately, the goal is to address that disadvantage, that marginalisation that exists in the Australian community, and bring more and more and more people into mainstream employment and the mainstream economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShaun Christie-David is the CEO of Plate it Forward Hospitality.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith four other restaurants as well, he says this is an opportunity for Plate it Forward to grow even further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This represents so much to us. I think where we're seeing is the incredible strength and talent of our team, accelerating in ways that are beyond what we would have dreamt of. So this allows us to move into more venues, more impact, more employment and great opportunities and outcomes for our incredible people from the under-represented communities that we serve.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Roya, cooking is deeply meaningful to her.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's a career she hopes to pursue further.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Western Australians have left the state \u2014 and even gone overseas \u2014 to pursue their dreams of having children due to laws that prevent gay couples and single men from becoming parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WA government is now planning to bring in legislation to overhaul the state's surrogacy and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) laws, eight years after it first promised reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes would allow same-sex male couples, single men, transgender and intersex people access to altruistic surrogacy. Currently, only heterosexual couples and single women can pursue altruistic surrogacy.\n\n\n\n'Monumental legislation'\n\nGay father of two Paul Hadfield-Jia said the legislation would be life-changing for many if passed. He knows first-hand how hard it can be for same sex couples in WA to have children.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Cambodia banned surrogacy. An Australian couple smuggled out the woman carrying their twins\n\nHadfield-Jia told SBS News the laws that restrict IVF and surrogacy are \"archaic\", and led to him travelling to the United States to become a parent, as he and his husband were not able to do so in Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Australia is the only Australian state where same sex couples and single men are not allowed to access surrogacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter finding an egg donor and surrogate in the US state of Idaho, Hadfield-Jia had the first of his two children, his daughter Samantha.\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing her back to Australia was another \"challenging\" process.\n\n\n\nPaul Hadfield-Jia with his daughter Samantha, surrogate Dianna and egg donor Mariah. Credit: Supplied \"Once you're in Australia, it's really hard trying to get your children into the system with Medicare and Centrelink, and a lot of these systems are not set up to care for or take care of people and families like my own or other heterosexual couples that have had children through surrogacy,\" Hadfield-Jia said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a whole process and it's so challenging, and there's so much more than just having to care and love for a child that's just been born.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he felt fortunate that overseas travel and surrogacy were an option for him, but for many, the associated costs remain a barrier to parenthood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the most monumental life-changing legislation that we've had in years from a gay community perspective,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How a fertility clinic hack turned Isaac\u2019s good deed into a privacy disaster\n\n\"In 2017, there was marriage equality, but it was only half the job. You're allowed to marry who you love, but you are not allowed to create a family because of who you love,\" Hadfield-Jia said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's hopeful the legislation would pass the state's parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why would our MPs not want to support legislation which will allow Western Australians to have their children and families safely here in WA?\"\n\n\n\nGay couples have felt 'not welcome' in WA\n\nSarah Jefford, a family creation lawyer and a surrogate herself, told SBS News she has had clients leave WA to become parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have had lesbian couples who haven't been able to do egg sharing in WA, so they have also travelled interstate to access treatment elsewhere,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know of several clients that are now living in Melbourne and Sydney because they didn't feel like they were welcome and thought this is supposed to be a progressive country, but actually the rainbow flag waving is bollocks because we're not even welcome here.\"\n\n\n\nJefford said if the legislation is passed, it would help more people become parents, saying the state had become \"less diverse\" due to the restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people have had kids interstate but been afraid to return to WA out of fear of stigma or shaming,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think in the future reforms will grow the availability and accessibility of surrogacy, particularly for gay couples and single men, but also for fertility treatments generally.\"\n\n\n\n'Well past due'\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said many people have been waiting for the Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Bill 2025 to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged there have been \"long-standing barriers\" to accessing IVF and surrogacy in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This legislation delivers on my government's commitment to modern, inclusive and evidence-based laws that reflect the needs of our community,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Alana felt good about donating her eggs until she realised her sexuality was an issue\n\nThe reforms would bring WA in line with the rest of the country, which Jefford said was a long-awaited change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's well past due and I'm not going to give them a pat on the back for doing something they should have done 10 years ago,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHadfield-Jia urged the state government to continue to consult with the LGBTIQ+ community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is just so important that our MPs understand and connect with people that have got lived experiences. It's so important that they connect with people to understand why this is so important before they make their decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because there are hundreds and hundreds of people, gay or straight, that want to have kids. And I've been waiting for a long time for this legislation to come through, and I think it's truly important.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Speaking about the record on the podcast, Swift said it was like \u201ccatching lightning in a bottle\u201d. She produced it in Europe during the Eras Tour, as a way to capture what was happening behind the scenes during the tour \u2013 what her \u201cinner life\u201d was like off-stage. It consists of some of her favourite songs she has ever recorded, she said. \u201cI was in Europe on the Eras Tour ... I\u2019d have three days off, I\u2019d fly to Sweden, and go back to the tour while actually working on this. I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour, but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted the album to feel like how my life felt. Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons, and you couldn\u2019t take one out, and it be the same album. It\u2019s just right. That kind of focus and discipline, keeping the bar that high, is something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time.\u201d\n\nReclaiming her masters Beyond the album news, she also touched on another momentous moment in her life recently: the reclamation of her masters in May, a moment that \u201cchanged her life\u201d. Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift appear on the New Heights podcast. Credit: YouTube \u201cIt\u2019s always been a huge thing for me. Since I was a teenager, I\u2019ve been actively saving up money to buy my music back,\u201d she said, adding that she \u201cdramatically fell to the floor\u201d when she found out she had finally managed to take ownership of her discography. \u201cThis will affect the rest of my life, and I think about this every day. But now, instead of it being like an intrusive thought that hurts me, it\u2019s: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this happened. How lucky am I?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe then shifted to the epic experience that was the Eras Tour, the highest-grossing concert tour in history during which she travelled to 51 cities across more than 600 days. The singer said she wouldn\u2019t change a thing about the tour \u2013 one where she was able to physically and mentally prepare for more than any of her previous global tours. \u201cI wanted it to [include] references that, I thought, were really high-concept and really high-value for fans, and for them to see things they hadn\u2019t necessarily seen before all in one concert,\u201d she said. Another promotional image for The Life of a Showgirl. Credit: Instagram \u201cBut I wanted to do it at the highest intensity, rapid fire \u2013 you\u2019re seeing something new every 15 to 30 seconds. So, it feels like you\u2019re scrolling in an algorithm, right? \u201cWhen I heard reports of people saying that they got actual amnesia after the concerts, I was like: \u2018Oh, I think we did it. I think we nailed it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAustralia and the Eras Tour One of her favourite parts of the Eras Tour, she said, was the unplanned moments and fan-led traditions. Taylor Swift performing at the Eras Tour in Melbourne. Credit: Getty For example, during the European leg, her audience collectively decided to bring in balloons, which they illuminated with their phone torches during the Willow segment, reflecting the orbs held on-stage. \u201cWas there a group text? How did you guys even do this? It was so special. It felt like we were all part of something together in a way that couldn\u2019t be planned. As much as I love and relish in planning, it was really fun that they would do things to delight me,\u201d Swift said.\n\nLoading Australia also got a direct mention, with the pop juggernaut describing the country as \u201camazing\u201d. Despite how fulfilling the tour was, the pop star admitted she\u2019s now enjoying a break \u2013 time she is apparently using to bake endless loaves of sourdough bread and watching otter videos with her boyfriend. An FYI on Easter eggs Before the official announcement of the new album, fans scoured a litany of Easter eggs carefully planted by the star, including cryptic photo galleries and intentionally timed social media posts.\n\nSwift touched on the very puzzles she used to share the recent news on the podcast, joking that the \u201cEaster egg thing is getting a little Zodiac Killer at this point\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life \u2013 it\u2019s always going to be towards music,\u201d she said. The singer is famed for dropping cheeky hints for her fans to deduce. Credit: Instagram \u201cI want Easter eggs to be a certain thing where if you are part of the fandom, and you want to experience music in a normal way, then you don\u2019t even see these \u2013 you don\u2019t even care what that thing is above that doorway, under that dimly lit, flickering light over there that\u2019s upside-down, backwards in Braille. But if you want to look at that, you can. If you know, you know.\u201d Despite general excitement around the album itself, Swift\u2019s decision to share the news on the Kelce brothers\u2019 podcast divided fans. On one hand, some Swifties applauded the podcast approach, arguing that it was the ideal way for the singer to reveal the news on her own terms, rather than those of powerful, large-scale media or entertainment organisations.",

    "text": "Though Fernandes noted that no player on the eve of the season would describe his manager in anything other than glowing terms \u2013 much less him with a fellow Portuguese \u2013 he seems completely genuine in his praise. The 30-year-old says he sees the game in the same way as Amorim, credits him with improving his personal output, and is grateful he has the \u201cbig balls\u201d needed to make the decisions that could shape the club\u2019s future. \u201cI can see something good coming for the team,\u201d he said. Bruno Fernandes after Manchester United\u2019s Europa League final defeat. Credit: Getty Images This season is a fresh start in a number of ways. Firstly, it\u2019s the first full one for Amorim, who took over in November after a disastrous start led to Erik ten Hag\u2019s sacking. Amorim could not arrest the slide which led to United\u2019s 16th-placed finish, their worst since 1989-90. He did get them into the Europa League final, but they lost the chance at a shortcut into the UEFA Champions League when they fell 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur, on a night when their limitations in attack were clear for all to see.\n\nThat\u2019s hopefully been addressed. Amorim has used his first true opportunity to dive into the transfer market by bringing in a new frontline: two wingers with plenty of EPL experience in Mathias Cunha, from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Bryan Mbuemo, from Brentford, either side of big Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s most exciting young strikers \u2013 from RB Leipzig. \u201cPutting them three together with everything we had already from last season will give big competition to everyone, and everyone will be fighting for their position into the team,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cYou just have to start strong again. At Manchester United, time doesn\u2019t exist. You have to do it now.\u201d Bruno Fernandes And Fernandes is still around, too. He was the subject of an eye-watering offer from Al Hilal, who were reportedly prepared to pay over $200 million to get him \u2013 a huge transfer fee for a player his age \u2013 and almost triple his $500,000-per-week wages. \u201cI know numbers matter the most in football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously it was a big number that the club could get for me. So I know how tough it was for the club. When I spoke with the president of Al Hilal, I spoke with him once and I told him, \u2018I\u2019ve never thought about leaving, I appreciate your call. Whatever you want to do or not, you can talk with the club,\u2019 because I\u2019ve always said if the club wanted to sell me, then yes, I had to make a decision. But if the club doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t have to make a decision, because my aim is to stay here. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money for me, too, but it is what it is. People make decisions in their lives. I won\u2019t regret it because this is the place I want to be and this is the place where I want to be successful also.\u201d Manchester United\u2019s renovated training facility underlines the sense of a fresh start this season. Credit: Getty Images Last week, renovations of United\u2019s training facilities were completed. When the Carrington Training Complex first opened in 2000, they were state of the art \u2013 but as the years ticked by, they became dark, dingy and outdated, and a metaphor for how their standards had slipped. Three years ago, in his infamous interview with Piers Morgan, Cristiano Ronaldo described them as frozen in time; according to reports, he wouldn\u2019t even use the main swimming pool because it had chipped and cracked tiles he deemed a hazard to player safety. Now, thanks to a $100 million redevelopment, Carrington is best-in-class again, and the most tangible manifestation of part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s ambitions for the club. The slick new facility includes the latest technology to assist player recovery (altitude chambers, underwater treadmills and the like), plus some pretty cool lounges for the team to hang out in (including a barber shop and an F1 simulator), which all adds to the sense of a new beginning, and of a club seeking to regain its rightful place on top of the pile \u2013 although for Fernandes, it\u2019s the little things that could make the biggest difference.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Sir Jim spoke about was the natural light into the building,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a small detail, a small thing that could make such a big difference for the people that work here, because they have to be here for a very long time and for them to be closed in a space where they can\u2019t see natural light is very difficult. People that work in the office, they always talk about this, that brings more sadness and not as a good environment to work [in]. Also for our physios, for our staff, it\u2019s going to be a much nicer space for them to be working with.\u201d So that\u2019s the building sorted. What about the rebuild of the team? That\u2019s ongoing and, at the same time, overdue. It\u2019s no longer possible for a fallen giant like United to return to the top of the Premier League without enduring a period of pain on the ascent. But how can they do that in a world of unrealistic expectations and supporter impatience, at a club that still holds global attention like no other? \u201cExpectations at this club are always high,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you rebuild or not. Manchester United has no time to rebuild. You just have to start strong again. That\u2019s all. No one will be saying that you need to rebuild. At Manchester United, time doesn\u2019t exist. You have to do it now.",

    "text": "4. Fountain of youth A decade of AFLW has built a genuine pipeline for talent. Girls who once dreamed of playing footy can now start in Auskick, progress through junior pathways and land on an AFLW list. The difference is clear \u2013 these players arrive at the elite level hardened, skilled and fearless. Watch Ash Centra at Collingwood or Havanna Harris at Gold Coast, and you\u2019ll see ready-made footballers. Then there are the rising stars who\u2019ve already made their mark \u2013 Matilda Scholz (Port Adelaide), last year\u2019s mark of the year winner, and Montana Ham (Sydney), whose presence and game-winning ability grow every season. These players aren\u2019t just the future \u2013 they\u2019re already reshaping the present. When I was growing up, I looked to St Kilda\u2019s Lenny Hayes as my childhood hero, but now you and your family can have a genuine female superstar to follow from any of the 18 clubs. 5. It starts at the top This season\u2019s coaches are a fascinating mix of tactical nous and lived experience. Former AFL names such as Rhyce Shaw (Gold Coast), Toby McLean (Bulldogs), Ben Brown (Essendon), and Brendan Fevola (Richmond) bring with them the sharpness and strategy of the men\u2019s game \u2013 Fevola even declaring Ellie McKenzie the best kick he\u2019s seen in either competition. There\u2019s also the influence of AFLW pioneers now moving into coaching, such as Daisy Pearce at West Coast and Lauren Arnell at Port Adelaide. And don\u2019t forget Darren Crocker at North Melbourne, who knows a thing or two about winning, having played in a premiership side in 1996. These voices are shaping a faster, more sophisticated brand of AFLW footy.\n\n6. Fastest-growing female sport The numbers tell the story: since the AFLW began, female participation in footy has exploded by nearly 200 per cent, from 42,000 players to more than 125,000. More than 2500 new women\u2019s and girls\u2019 teams have sprung up around the country, and the AFL is now the largest employer of female athletes nationwide. Every girl who laces up her boots today has a clearer, straighter path to the elite level than ever before, and AFLW is the stage where those dreams can become reality. When you watch, you\u2019re not just seeing a game \u2013 you\u2019re seeing the result of a generational shift. Our newest draftees started their pathway when they were eight or nine years old \u2014 10 years ago!

Community heartbeat AFLW still has something the men\u2019s competition has mostly lost: the community feel that makes you feel part of the game, not just a spectator. Many games are played at local grounds, where you can stand on the boundary, hear the on-field calls, and be close enough to see the players\u2019 facial expressions. It\u2019s football in its purest form \u2013 close to the action, surrounded by families and fans, with a post-match kick-to-kick on the oval. For those who love the romance of suburban footy, AFLW is a time machine back to the game\u2019s grassroots charm. Head down to Arden Street, back to the Kennel, or off to Moorabbin to take a time warp in the best possible way.\n\n8. Milestones with meaning This year, some of the league\u2019s trailblazers are closing in on 100 games, all consecutive. In the men\u2019s competition, 100 games is a solid achievement; in AFLW, it\u2019s monumental. Shorter seasons mean it has taken almost a decade to reach, and these players have carried the league through its formative years \u2013 playing in the heat of summer, the chill of winter, and often in front of smaller crowds before the momentum built. Every milestone game this season will be a celebration not just of individual endurance, but of the resilience of the entire competition. Watch out for Ebony Marinoff (Adelaide) and Ally Anderson (Brisbane Lions) to be the first ones to hit it. Me and Bre Koenon (Brisbane Lions) are currently two games behind them on 91. This is the equivalent of a man playing 250 consecutive games in the AFL \u2013 a feat only reached by greats such as Jim Stynes and Jack Crisp. AFLW star Ebony Marinoff. Credit: AFL Photos 9. A welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere At AFLW games, the footy is fierce, but the atmosphere is warm. Tickets are affordable, seating is relaxed, and the stands are filled with people of all ages and backgrounds. It\u2019s a space where kids can see their heroes up close, where parents don\u2019t have to worry about rowdy crowds, and where first timers are embraced as quickly as long-time members. It\u2019s the game you love, wrapped in a sense of community and belonging that\u2019s hard to find anywhere else. There are always plenty of activities for kids to enjoy, and the surroundings are really intimate.\n\nLoading 10. Every supporter helps grow the game AFLW is still building, and every eyeball, every ticket, every shout from the boundary line matters. Growth in crowds and TV audiences directly strengthens the league\u2019s ability to push for longer seasons, better pay and greater exposure. The current target is moving from 12 games a year to 14, and eventually to a full home-and-away fixture. The more support we give now, the sooner that vision becomes reality \u2013 for today\u2019s players and for every young girl dreaming of one day pulling on an AFLW jumper. What\u2019s exciting is that many of our men\u2019s heroes now have children, often girls, and many of these will play for your club under the father-daughter rule. Imagine watching a mini Matthew Richardson kick a goal for the Tigers after a lace-out kick from one of Trent Cotchin\u2019s daughters! Ten reasons are more than enough. Now it\u2019s over to you to vote with your feet and by watching on TV. This season is shaping up to be the best we\u2019ve ever seen, and we want you there with us. Come and watch us play, follow your team\u2019s journey, and join in the fun from the first bounce to the final siren. Every cheer from the stands, every clap, every new face in the crowd helps us grow the game and inspire the next generation. It\u2019s not the intimidating noise of 100,000 bullish people at the MCG, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For Rebecca F. Kuang, the easiest way to resist the internet is to carry a phone that won\u2019t cooperate. It doesn\u2019t glow, buzz, or beg for her attention \u2013 and she prefers it that way. It\u2019s a statement of defiance against the glowing promise that apps would make us more connected and productive. Instead, Kuang says, they\u2019ve shredded attention spans and left us more alone than ever. \u201cMy phone\u2019s basically a brick. It can\u2019t access most apps,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople can\u2019t send me TikTok links. I can never see them. Of course, a lot of stuff is going to get caught in the net, but on the whole, it\u2019s great because I spend so much more time reading and writing and cooking and being grounded in the world around me and very little time online.\u201d No X, no TikTok, no doom spiral of headlines \u2013 a notable abstinence, given the starring role the internet played in her bestselling 2023 novel Yellowface, a razor-edged literary satire about a struggling white writer who swipes the manuscript and identity of her dead Chinese friend, only to face the wrath of the online mob. Rebecca Kuang photographed at the Boston Public Library. Credit: Ben Sklar \u201cThat was my internet novel. It was really me getting the internet out of my system. I\u2019m actually pretty extreme about digital minimalism,\u201d Kuang, who publishes as R.F. Kuang, says. \u201cI knew I was never going to write a book like Yellowface again because that just was not a sustainable way for me to be in the world, so I felt like this freedom to do whatever I wanted with the next book. It will probably appeal to a different set of readers, and that\u2019s exciting to me, like I\u2019m tired of talking about Yellowface.\u201d Kuang is in her husband Bennett Eckert-Kuang\u2019s study in their Boston home when we speak over video \u2013 not her natural habitat. Enclosed spaces, she explains, feel stifling; she prefers to work somewhere open, where the air can move and the light can spill in. But today, the fading light cuts across her face, artfully preparing us for the shadows of her new novel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYellowface looks down on delegates at the publisher\u2019s stand during the first day of the London Book Fair in 2023. Credit: In Pictures via Getty Images If you haven\u2019t read Yellowface, you\u2019ve almost certainly seen it \u2013 the bold, winking yellow cover staring back at you from bookshop tables and BookTok. Inside, Kuang skewers the publishing industry and the chronically online mindset with a scalpel and a smirk: taking on how technology has rewired the way we consume art, perform outrage, and weaponise accountability. It\u2019s been optioned for a scripted television series with Karyn Kusama (The Invitation, Yellowjackets, Girlfight) attached to direct. While Yellowface was strikingly topical and opened the door to a wider readership, Kuang had already been forging her path through the searing landscapes of historical fantasy with The Poppy War trilogy (2018\u20132020) and Babel (2022). Drawing on mid-20th-century Chinese history and begun when she was just 19, The Poppy War was no overnight success \u2013 Kuang admits she initially felt \u201csick to my stomach\u201d every time she thought about sales \u2013 but word of mouth gradually built momentum. Meanwhile, Babel, set in 1830s England, became a BookTok hit. This steady rise meant, Kuang says, the sudden attention from Yellowface never \u201cmessed me up\u201d. Rebecca Kuang attends the 2023 TIME100 Next in 2023. Credit: Getty Images As she critiqued publishing\u2019s pigeonholing of authors in Yellowface, Kuang herself refuses to be confined by genre or expectation. Almost as soon as she penned the novel, Kuang admits she was bored with the frenetic, internet-fuelled tone that is omnipresent in today\u2019s literary landscape \u2013 eager instead to explore new territories, both thematically and stylistically, in her work. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m still very young, and I want room to grow, so to be typecast now would feel stifling and murderous to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think there is this sort of resistant delight to defying categorisation because when you are pretty overtly racialised or gendered, as so many people are, you do always want to be acting out against expectation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat resentment of expectation is not what drives me. It\u2019s just something I find psychologically interesting about myself. What drives me is wanting to evolve as an artist with every project.\u201d I think it never got to my head or messed me up because I\u2019m really good at moving on to the next project. She\u2019s also grown wary of publishing\u2019s other obsession \u2013 youth. In a recent piece for Time headlined Olivia Rodrigo and the Impossible Pressure to Stay a Prodigy, Kuang, 29, reflects on the pressure of being \u201cyoung\u201d in the literary world. The scepticism that has met her, the interest in her age rather than work, and the anxiety that the apex of her career might have come and gone. \u201cIt\u2019s really stupid, I think, that we are so obsessed with young authors in literature. Literature is one of the one things that you only get better at as you get older,\u201d Kuang says. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not in my prime. I hope that my prime is decades away.\u201d Kuang might not realise it yet, given her self-imposed social media ban, but her readers are already gearing up for her sixth novel out this month. Roll your eyes at BookTokers if you like, but they\u2019re busily assembling reading lists heavy with Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and Dante as they prepare for the release of Katabasis \u2013 a richly layered, genre-bending dive into the underworld. (The title comes from the Greek word meaning \u201cdescent\u201d). Rebecca Kuang\u2019s new novel, Katabasis, plays with classic texts about the afterlife. Credit: Ben Sklar In Katabasis, Cambridge doctoral student Alice Law and her nemesis Peter Murdoch wield pentagram magic to descend into the Eight Courts of Hell, all in a desperate bid to rescue their professor\u2019s soul \u2013 without him, their crucial recommendation letter is lost. The novel deftly plays with the classical stages of the underworld journey \u2013 the descent, the ordeal, and the return (anabasis) \u2013 while tipping its hat to Alice in Wonderland, T.S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land, and even drawing from the surreal dreamscapes of Dali.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re counting subgenres, it\u2019s a clever mashup of dark academia and historical fantasy, with an enemies-to-lovers twist. And while this might seem underworlds apart from Yellowface, Kuang is as critical as ever, cutting through the pretension, privilege, and politics of academia. If Babel\u2019s Oxford setting allowed an examination of the institution\u2019s historical role as a facilitator of imperial projects, Katabasis focuses on the interpersonal \u2013 the inflated egos, the skewed priorities and values, and the fraught, often toxic, relationships between students and teachers. \u201cI think of them as a duology that deals with why I love the academy so much and can\u2019t step away but why I am increasingly uncomfortable with it,\u201d Kuang says, perfectly placed to say so, having roamed some of the world\u2019s most elite academic halls. From her undergraduate years at Georgetown University to graduate degrees at Cambridge and Oxford, she\u2019s now teaching and finishing a PhD in sinology at Yale. Her research spans Chinese-language literature and Asian American writing, focusing on Chinese American and Chinese diaspora authors and their explorations of travel, language, geography, and storytelling. Kuang \u2013 who was born in Guangzhou, China, moved with her parents to Dallas, Texas, when she was four \u2013 grew up in a household that valued literature highly and was always drawn to fantasy. Rebecca Kuang says she enjoys defying expectations when it comes to genres and styles. Credit: Ben Sklar She started her PhD the same year as her husband, who\u2019s pursuing philosophy at MIT, started his. They recently celebrated their first anniversary. While some couples spend their evenings arguing over whether a potato is too far gone to cook for dinner, theirs seems to involve lively debates on logic paradoxes and the quirks of rational decision-making, conversations about which inspired Katabasis. \u201cI just fell in love with the idea of logic paradoxes, especially paradoxes of rational decision-making, which feels very pertinent to how we live our lives,\u201d Kuang says. \u201cThere are so many paradoxes where you make a series of decisions that seem like you\u2019re better off at every stage, and then suddenly you find yourself in a far worse position than you anticipated, with no way to claw out of it. And that seemed like a lovely way to describe being in a PhD program.\u201d Rebecca Kuang has been writing novels since she was 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKuang\u2019s academic and creative worlds have never been separate \u2013 they flow into one another. Her novels are set on campuses or in educational institutions, and weave in her scholarly pursuits. Her advisors often remind her to rein in her signature point of view, reminding her she\u2019s writing an essay, not fiction. \u201cI find it very difficult to keep the creative voice from seeping into my academic work. I\u2019m always having conversations with my advisor about how my academic writing needs to be a little less opinionated and have a little less of that spunk and flair that I like to bring to my fiction prose.\u201d Having reached new heights after Yellowface, Kuang could now write full-time. When asked why she hasn\u2019t stepped away from academia, the answer is simple: \u201cI like it.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m still very young, and I want room to grow, so to be typecast now would feel stifling and murderous to me. \u201cI wish I had a more sophisticated answer than that, but I think I\u2019m in a lucky position where I have multiple career options. I could be a full-time author, I could be a full-time academic, and I just enjoy both too much to give either of them up. I always tell myself, the moment it stops being engaging, I\u2019ll step away,\u201d Kuang says. \u201cFor all that is frustrating and broken about academia, I\u2019m still committed to this core promise of inquiry and curiosity and sharing it with others, and I do still regularly feel that when I step into a classroom.\u201d She didn\u2019t feel the weight of expectation after Yellowface \u2013 no sudden compulsion to chase its sharp success or bottle its biting style. Instead, she slipped quietly into her next chapter, boarding a flight to Taipei to plunge straight into research for a new book.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Entering Sydney\u2019s largest underground rail cavern, you are struck by a mass of blue-coloured waterproof lining that covers its walls and ceiling. At 28 metres wide and 180 metres long, the size of the cavern built beneath the northern end of central Sydney for the $25.3 billion Metro West line is breathtaking. Yet what is not obvious is how close it comes to buildings, existing rail tunnels and critical power cables for the CBD. Illustrating the challenge for contractors, the top of the cavern sits just six metres below the foundations of a 169-year-old heritage hotel built from sandstone. Once opened in 2032, the Hunter Street metro station will become the hub for train travel in and out of the northern part of the CBD. It will connect existing heavy rail and metro stations at Martin Place to Wynyard, allowing people to switch between multiple lines without setting foot above ground. The size of the cavern for the Metro West station beneath Hunter Street is breathtaking. Credit: Steven Siewert It will be bigger than both Victoria Cross station in North Sydney and the Martin Place metro station, which is the busiest on the M1 line between the city\u2019s north-west and Sydenham. The reason for its size is simple. While it is forecast to handle 10,000 passengers an hour when it opens in 2032, the only station in the CBD for Metro West is being built for a staggering 40,000 people an hour. Sydney Metro chief executive Peter Regan said the station was being built to be bigger than others to cater for the \u201cvery large volume of people\u201d entering and exiting at the same time, and major growth over coming decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe complexity of what you\u2019re seeing down in that cavern is like nothing we\u2019ve done before in terms of the scale of what is being built under the city. It will become the biggest rail cavern in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cHunter Street will be a very busy station because it\u2019s the end of the line, and it\u2019s the only station in the CBD [for Metro West].\u201d In comparison, the M1 line has four stations in the central city \u2013 Barangaroo, Martin Place, Gadigal and Central \u2013 which means passenger loads during the peak periods are spread, instead of concentrated on one. Initially, six-carriage driverless trains will run on the 24-kilometre line between Parramatta and the CBD every four minutes in each direction. However, the 180-metre-long stations on the Metro West line allow for trains as long as eight carriages to eventually be operated. \u201cIt\u2019s designed very much to grow as a station,\u201d Regan said. A tunnel that will connect the existing Martin Place metro station to the new Hunter Street station for Metro West. Credit: Steven Siewert Hunter and Pyrmont stations construction manager Dave Maytom said one of the challenges was the wide span of the cavern and the fact that it was, on average, only about 10 metres beneath the surface. \u201cThat is very shallow. To create a large hole, you need a body of rock to support itself above that cavern,\u201d he said, explaining that to provide support a type of concrete known as shotcrete up to half a metre thick was applied. \u201cWorking in that city environment is hugely challenging.\u201d About 28,000 tonnes of concrete have been poured to form the cavern floor, leaving more than a third of its construction completed. Excavation of the cavern and most of the connecting tunnels was finished in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo giant boring machines are due to break through into the cavern by the end of the year, which will complete twin tunnels between the Bays precinct at Rozelle and the CBD. It will mark a shift for the mega project from digging tunnels and giant holes to building and fitting out stations, as well as the laying of rail tracks and installation of vital equipment. At the western end of the cavern beneath Hunter Street, three giant concrete pillars serve as structural supports for the roof, and will be where three tunnels each about eight metres wide will enter, one of which will be for passengers. Saint Barbara, who is patron saint of tunnellers and engineers, has watched over excavation of the subterranean cathedral-like cavern.

Passengers will make their way down via banks of escalators and lifts to a concourse level, before taking another set of escalators to the platforms. The forecast volume of passengers is such that Sydney Metro, a government agency, is considering widening a pedestrian link under George Street between Wynyard station and the western end of Hunter Street station. A direct pedestrian link will be built between the Hunter Street station concourse and the platform level at the existing Martin Place metro station. Importantly, passengers will not need to pass through ticket gates to walk between the two. Transport Minister John Graham said the station would be at the middle of an underground spiderweb of connections in the CBD. \u201cIt will open up direct connectivity to every metro line and every train line without ever having to go above ground to cross a street,\u201d he said. \u201c[It] is an engineering feat of which the numbers tell the story of its scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "An investigation by this masthead has unearthed hundreds of WhatsApp messages showing nurses subscribed to Fresh Clinics asking their peers to buy, borrow, or swap prescription-only anti-wrinkle medications, including Botox, Dysport and Xeomin.\n\nIt was not an isolated exchange. It\u2019s also illegal.\n\nThe post was shared to a WhatsApp group for nurses and clinics using the services of injectables company Fresh Clinics, and it triggered swift offers of help. One nurse in South Melbourne replied nine minutes later, offering to supply the drug that day.\n\n\u201cVery unethical, I know,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I am open over the Christmas/New Year period and have been left with nothing as the past week we have been inundated. I thought I had enough stock. Please don\u2019t judge me.\u201d\n\nThe owner of a Geelong skin clinic was frantically trying to buy anti-wrinkle drugs from her peers, an act prohibited under Australian medication laws.\n\nAt 7.48am on Christmas Day in 2020, a desperate plea pinged in a WhatsApp group for nurses subscribing to Australia\u2019s largest cosmetic injectables telehealth company.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone have two vials of Botox I could buy off them? I have 3 days left in clinic before going away for 3 months and don\u2019t want to leave anything sitting in my fridge,\u201d said another in an April 2023 exchange.\n\nReplies arrived within minutes \u2013 offers to help out from Melbourne suburbs Frankston, Williams Landing and Blackburn.\n\n\u201cHey guys! Anyone have a spare vial (Dysport or Botox) I can grab asap?\u201d a Melbourne-based nurse wrote in December 2023. \u201cI\u2019m willing to travel anywhere in Melbourne. I\u2019ve already ordered but it didn\u2019t come on time for my patients tomorrow! Would appreciate it heaps.\u201d\n\nRequests were often met with near-instant offers, highlighting how quickly supply could be sourced through the informal networks.\n\nThe WhatsApp messages used varied terminology \u2014 buy, borrow, sell, grab \u2013 but the effect was the same: restricted drugs changing hands outside formal supply channels, arranged via encrypted group chats.\n\nUnder Australian law these Schedule 4 drugs can only be supplied by licensed wholesalers to authorised prescribers or pharmacists, to safeguard patient safety and control the movement of drugs.\n\nFresh Clinics does not directly employ the nurses working in the injectables clinics. The clinics are independent businesses which pay a subscription to Fresh Clinics to access doctors and medicines.\n\nA NSW Health spokesman likewise said the medications could only be obtained by an authorised practitioner and could not be resupplied.\n\nAsked to respond to the messages, a Victorian Health Department spokeswoman said: \u201cThe trading of Schedule 4 medicines between clinics is not lawful.\u201d\n\nAs telehealth fuels the expansion of Australia\u2019s booming $4 billion injectables industry, regulators are scrambling to roll out changes to protect patients.\n\nOther nurses offered to sell stock they no longer needed: \u201cI made an order in error \u2013 would anyone like to buy some Botox?\u201d a nurse wrote in June 2023. \u201cI can grab some off you,\u201d another replied. \u201cYes pls!\u201d added a third quickly.\n\nIn one November 2023 exchange, a nurse asked: \u201cHi team, does anyone stock [cosmetic filler] Sculptra? Can I buy one off you please?\u201d The co-owner of Fresh Clinics, John Holbrook, responds: \u201cYou can\u2019t on-sell it. But we can assist to move it across clinics.\u201d\n\nUnder the Fresh Clinics model, nurses, operating as independent businesses, consult with clients, then request a remote video review by a Fresh Clinics doctor, who issues a script. The nurse administers the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese communications illustrate an unlawful black market for prescription-only cosmetic medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system loses integrity, meaning that any harmed patients will struggle to obtain a remedy.\u201d\n\nDr Christopher Rudge, a lecturer in health practitioner law at the University of Sydney, reviewed the WhatsApp messages and said they illustrated unlawful trading and created an untraceable supply chain.\n\n\u201cFresh Clinics ensures that all stock transfers between clinics comply with the latest federal and state regulations,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nThere is no suggestion Fresh Clinics has broken the law, and in a statement it said it had done nothing wrong.\n\nFresh Clinics staff were aware of this. In March 2022 the company\u2019s clinical director replied to a nurse post: \u201cThese can\u2019t be onsold \u2026 onselling of a schedule medication is illegal.\u201d\n\nFederal law prohibits the unauthorised sale or transfer of Schedule 4 medicines. Prescription-only drugs must be distributed by licensed wholesalers to authorised practitioners, not traded peer to peer.\n\nIn March this year, this masthead revealed that some Fresh Clinics doctor consultations lasted as little as 52 seconds before a script was approved. Following that investigation, new rules released in June by Australia\u2019s health practitioner watchdog included tighter rules for first-time patients and restrictions on issuing high-speed telehealth scripts.\n\nThe model was designed for flexibility. But many doctors who practise in-person medicine argue it removes critical points of clinical oversight.\n\nFresh charges a per patient fee \u2013 usually $25 \u2013 and also leaves nurses to handle ordering, storage and administration of the medication.\n\nCo-founder John Delaney was more direct when fielding questions via a different WhatsApp forum in April this year: \u201cWholesalers can only sell to a doctor, nurse practitioner or pharmacist.\u201d\n\nYet elsewhere, other staff advised workarounds. In 2021, co-founder John Holbrook wrote to one nurse: \u201cHi [name removed], it\u2019s not legal for you guys to onsell medication. But [Fresh Clinics staffer] can help out seeing if there\u2019s somewhere that Dysport can be borrowed and replaced from.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cborrow and replace\u201d system was sometimes formalised, other times not. In one message, the company\u2019s head of clinical training advised a nurse: \u201cLet us know who you end up getting product from and we will invoice you and send out replacement to the nurse who loans the product.\u201d\n\nThe nurse responded: \u201cThanks so much, for sure \u2018sell\u2019 was probably the wrong word to use as I know you guys reimbursed the lender with product.\u201d\n\nAirtasker driver, Kmart Esky\n\nIt was May 2021, and a senior Fresh Clinics manager was on the hunt for a new delivery driver. She proposed the company \u201cload a new job every day onto Airtasker with the anticipated jobs for the day\u201d.\n\nThen, she posted a job on Airtasker for a driver to deliver for an \u201caesthetic supply company\u201d at $840 per week. \u201cOwn vehicle necessary,\u201d the ad said.\n\nThe job went to Shah, a part-time driver who also delivered auto spare parts. He told this masthead he didn\u2019t know what was in the boxes he would drop off to clinics, just that they were packed professionally.\n\n\u201cSome of them were very urgent, some weren\u2019t,\u201d said Shah, who declined to give his surname. \u201cI just put extra ice inside the Esky. So I had to get the ice \u2026 and I just put it in my car.\u201d\n\nA staff message to Shah from that time reads: \u201cHave you bought the Esky?\u201d Shah replied: \u201cBuying it now in Kmart Broadway.\u201d\n\nApproached about this and other issues raised in WhatsApp messages, the Therapeutic Goods Administration declined to comment, saying responsibility rested with states and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. That agency, in turn, referred queries to state health authorities.\n\nCosmetic physician Ronald Feiner, the medical dean of the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery and Medicine, said transporting botulinum toxin, commonly known by the brand name Botox, in an Esky put patient safety at risk.\n\nHe said the substance must be stored at stable, cold temperatures \u2013 usually between 2 to 8 degrees \u2013 in order to be effective. Improper handling could compromise product quality and increase the risk of infection and tissue damage, Feiner said.\n\n\u201cIt is way below standard and unacceptable,\u201d he said of the Esky transportation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t accept products transported in that manner and I wouldn\u2019t inject it into my patients. It is completely substandard.\u201d\n\nFeiner is also a co-ordinator at the International Master Course on Ageing Science, which hosts the world\u2019s leading cosmetic dermatology and plastic surgery meeting and reviews cosmetic complications lodged by doctors from around the world.\n\nHe said the group reviewed a complication linked to botulinum toxin around once a week, and always questioned whether the substance was stored and transported correctly.\n\n\u201cImproper storage may lead to product degradation, which can cause infections and tissue damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis damage can lead to depressions in the skin like little finger compressions.\u201d\n\nThis GIF of US TV host Stephen Colbert was posted in a chat between Fresh Clinics workers. Credit: Marija Ercegovac\n\nIn addition, he said botulinum toxin stored at incorrect temperatures might be ineffective or wear off more quickly.\n\nOther messages seen by this masthead showed Fresh Clinics staff sometimes also adopted a tone that minimised the seriousness of their work.\n\nIn a 2021 thread, the company\u2019s head of training posted a meme of American TV host Stephen Colbert waving oversized syringes, alongside a text discussing Fresh\u2019s $25 telehealth consults now possible via the company\u2019s app. Her caption: \u201cAnd we don\u2019t take any liability LOL.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange in one of the WhatsApp groups, when a nurse asked if unmixed Botox left out of the fridge could still be used, co-founder Holbrook responded: \u201cIt\u2019s good for use on yourself/family at a minimum.\u201d\n\nFresh Clinics goes political\n\nAs scrutiny of the injectables industry has intensified in recent years, Fresh Clinics has become more politically active. In May federal lobbying firm Barton Deakin registered as its lobbyist, followed in June by Hawker Britton. In July, PR agency Sling & Stone registered as its third Canberra lobbyist.\n\nResearcher Maddison Johnstone, from advocacy group Operation Redress, said the industry had undercut its own arguments about professionalism.\n\n\u201cIt seems the industry has dabbled in the very thing it purports to be against when it suits their commercial interests. Patients deserve better \u2013 they pay through the nose and trust licensed clinics are prioritising their safety.\u201d\n\nResearcher Maddison Johnstone. Credit: Paul Harris\n\nIn response to detailed questions from this masthead, a Fresh Clinics spokeswoman said the company\u2019s \u201cwell-connected network of nurses and doctors\u201d included \u201ca private WhatsApp community where we share industry insights, tips, trends and regulatory updates and requirements\u201d.\n\nShe said nurses co-ordinating stock transfers with doctor oversight \u201cis consistent with long-standing medical practices, with some stock transfers co-ordinated via private messaging platforms. Fresh Clinics ensures that all stock transfers between clinics comply with the latest federal and state regulations.\u201d\n\nShe said while some of the transfers appeared to be selling, swapping and trading, they were in fact not. \u201cWhile some members may use varying degrees of terminology, Fresh Clinics monitors this channel and corrects any misused language where possible.\u201d\n\nA NSW Health spokesman said that under the state\u2019s Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act, cosmetic medicines like botulinum toxin can only be bought by an authorised practitioner, such as a doctor or nurse practitioner.\n\nLoading\n\nHe stressed that these drugs \u201ccannot be resupplied to another clinic or authorised practitioner\u201d.\n\nThe NSW regulator warned that anyone suspected of breaking these laws would be investigated.\n\nAnd, just as in Victoria, which said trading Schedule 4 medicines between clinics was not lawful, a Queensland Health Department spokeswoman said: \u201c\u2018swapping\u2019 or \u2018borrowing\u2019 Schedule 4 medicines amounts to \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018supply\u2019, which is not permitted in Queensland unless authorised\u201d.\n\nDr Christopher Rudge, who also reviewed the messages, said the behaviour constituted professional misconduct that could lead to a tribunal revoking a practitioner\u2019s registration.\n\nA system built for speed \u2013 not scrutiny\n\nThe hundreds of WhatsApp screenshots seen by this masthead show clinic owners and nurses often operating with a sense of urgency to maintain supply.\n\nLoading\n\nAnd while senior staff at Fresh Clinics can be seen intervening on some exchanges to remind nurses not to on-sell products, the messages are otherwise devoid of references to bodies like the TGA and state health laws, or consulting pharmacists.\n\nThe Christmas Day message at the start of this story from the Geelong clinic owner, who this masthead attempted unsuccessfully to contact, still stands out: \u201cVery unethical, I know \u2026 Please don\u2019t judge me.\u201d\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

    "text": "Australia's jobless rate has fallen to 4.2 per cent, but the Reserve Bank is unlikely to be overly concerned that the jobs market is tightening further.\n\nThe 0.1 per cent drop in July, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday, was in line with market expectations.\n\nAbout 25,000 jobs were added to the economy, slightly higher than expected, while the number of unemployed people decreased by 10,000.\n\nGrowth in unemployment was driven by full-time jobs, which increased by 60,000, while part-time employment fell 36,000.\n\nThe underlying trend in employment growth has been faster than the rise in population for most of the past year, but in recent months the two were growing at roughly the same rate, said ABS head of labour statistics Sean Crick.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe unemployment rate aligns with the Reserve Bank's forecast for the June quarter, which was released on Tuesday.\n\nAfter a surprise 0.2 per cent jump in unemployment in June, economists noted the rise was partly due to a sub-sample with a higher-than-average unemployment rate being rotated into the survey.\n\nSo while the modest reversal in Thursday's print is a further sign of the resilience of Australia's labour market, it doesn't necessarily indicate conditions are tightening again.\n\nIndeed, RBA governor Michele Bullock noted various indicators suggest conditions in the labour market had eased in recent months.\n\nGovernor Michele Bullock explains the Monetary Policy Board's decision to lower the cash rate to 3.60 per cent\n\n\n\nYou can read the full statement here: https://t.co/Rh1csz80wY pic.twitter.com/vkimPiSkE6 \u2014 Reserve Bank of Australia (@RBAInfo) August 12, 2025\n\n\"There's some sense in which the labour market is easing. There are some indicators that we think suggest that things are still a little bit on the tight side,\" she told reporters after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"If we can maintain where we are I don't think that's a bad thing.\"\n\nThe participation rate remained at a relatively high 67 per cent.\n\nFemale full-time workers grew by 40,000, double the amount of new male full-time workers, with the female participation rate reaching a record high.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said Australia's economy was making encouraging progress, with inflation down, interest rates falling and the labour market in good health.\n\n\"Under the Albanese Labor government, we have seen the lowest average unemployment rate of any government, in the last 50 years,\" Dr Chalmers said ahead of the ABS release.",
