I sought a view.\"\n\nChalmers said it was \"normal practice\" to seek advice on such a matter and that the Treasury's view was a change to negative gearing \"wouldn't get the sort of improvement that we desperately need to see in our economy when it comes to supply\".\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese was accused of lying over the Treasury's move to seek advice on negative gearing. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nHe said Labor was \"not proposing any changes in this area\".\n\n\ufeffShadow treasurer Angus Taylor claimed Albanese \"lied\" about plans to raise housing taxes during the debate.\n\n\"The prime minister last night denied his government had modelled negative gearing changes. The treasurer confirmed in September it had,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"The prime minister lied to the Australian public on camera about his hidden plans to raise taxes on housing.\"\n\nDutton argued cutting negative gearing would worsen the rental market.\n\n\"I have stated very clearly, we want a sustainable housing market, which includes rental stock,\" the opposition leader when debate moderator David Speers asked why his party wouldn't change the capital gains tax discount or negative gearing.\n\n\"If you want to cut out negative gearing, as the Labor Party and the Greens would love to do, you will stop investment taking place for properties that are ultimately rented by young Australians.\"\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt said the Greens would reform tax concessions for investors. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nREAD MORE: When shops will be open and closed this Easter around the country\n\nA report released today by parliament revealed the cost of revenue forgone due to both negative gearing deductions and capital gains discounts was $11.9 \ufeffbillion in the 2024/25 financial year.\n\nIt's estimated the combined cost will reach $180.5 billion over the next 10 years from 2026/27 until 2035/36.\n\nGreens spokesperson for housing and homelessness Max Chandler-Mather said the Greens would work to abolish \"massive tax handouts\" for property investors.\n\n\"The Greens will right the wrongs of decades of housing failure and end the tax handouts for investors with more than one investment property that are turbocharging house prices and denying renters the chance to buy a home,\" Chandler-Mather said.\n\n\"How is it fair that a young family loses at an auction to an investor buying their 10th property because that investor has massive tax handouts from the government?\"\n\nFormer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a post on X that negative gearing is \"examined by every government\".\n\n\ufeff\"It is a major tax concession and always contentious and so it is always looked at \u2013 what does it cost?\" Turnbull said.\n\n\"What would particular changes mean in terms of revenue and housing affordability.\"",

    "text": "The Albanese government's changes to Australia's industrial relations laws have been hotly debated in the lead-up to the federal election.\n\nIn Western Australia, much of the attention has focused on the potential return of major unions to the Pilbara, where they once boasted significant membership and power.\n\nSome say strikes were rife and overall productivity low, as a workforce that was still majority residential defended what they viewed as hard-won pay and conditions.\n\nIndustry fears a return to \"the bad old days\" of union power will disrupt a region regarded as the powerhouse of the Australian economy.\n\nBut supporters say the concerns are overblown.\n\nHow bad were the 'bad old days'?\n\nIron ore mining took off in WA's Pilbara in the 1960s, with union presence in the region rising in line with national rates of union membership.\n\nBy the 1970s, WA mining was home to \"one of the most strike-prone sections of the Australian workforce\", according to industrial relations historian Alexis Vassiley.\n\n\"Workers struck for 12 days per year on average, compared to 'only' 7.5 days for the notorious coal miners,\" he wrote in his recently published book.\n\nEven the region's most enduring symbol \u2014 Red Dog \u2014 was a fully paid member of the Transport Workers' Union.\n\nEven Red Dog was a paid-up member of the unions in the mid-1970s. (ABC News: Charlie Mills)\n\nDr Vassiley, who has spent years researching the rise of the union movement in the Pilbara, said it was intensified by the rapidly growing workforce, with many fed up with poor conditions and long hours.\n\n\"By about 1970, the unions have a big breakthrough,\" he said.\n\nThe Party Room Photo shows An orange background with graphics and words reading The Party Room with Kelly and Karvelas with the ABC LIsten app logo.

Stream The Party Room on ABC listen.\n\n\"All of the companies in that year, they get a big reduction in hours worked per week, a big increase in pay and significant increases in conditions.\"\n\nLarry Graham moved to the Pilbara in the 1970s and worked as an electrician and union convenor before serving as the state member for the Pilbara from 1989 until 2005.\n\nMr Graham said the way unions operated in the Pilbara was unique.\n\n\"We had shop floor unions where if you were elected by the rank and file, you had as much say in what happened in the union as the state council of the union did,\" he said.\n\n\"We were incredibly powerful and as long as you maintained the support of the troops, you basically ran the show.\n\n\"In my case, the state secretary of the union wouldn't have dared to come onto the Port Hedland site without my approval.\"\n\nLarry Graham represented the Pilbara in WA's parliament from 1989 to 2005. (Supplied: Larry Graham)\n\nMr Graham credits unions with securing things still enjoyed by the modern FIFO worker, including pay, conditions, superannuation, housing support, health insurance and job security.\n\n\"Even though the early companies were fantastic companies, the concept of doing things differently really wasn't their strong point,\" he said.\n\n\"So the unions had to arm wrestle the companies into a position where they would actually deal with the unions.\"\n\nAs an example, Mr Graham recounted an episode in the early 1980s where his footy coach, a local school teacher, mentioned their departmental houses did not have air conditioning.\n\nAttempts to get it fixed through departmental channels had failed, so he called the chief executive of Mount Newman Mining.\n\n\"I said to him, 'Are you aware school teachers don't have air conditioning, we can't live with that', I'm giving you two weeks' notice that we're going to start a Pilbara-wide dispute unless that gets fixed',\" he said.\n\n\"He rang [then-premier] Charlie Court and it was fixed in a week.\"\n\nMr Graham reflects proudly on the influence of the unions, but acknowledged they weren't perfect.\n\n\"There were things that went wrong, there's absolutely no doubt about that,\" he said.\n\n\"We had some loonies [sic] who made nuisances of themselves in a big way.\n\n\"We had some really heavy strikes, some of those were good, some of those were bad.\"\n\nBut Mr Graham said achievements far outweighed union shortfalls.\n\n\"Inside 15 years, the trade union movement in the Pilbara hammered the companies that hard on safety, that it became safer than the real estate industry in Perth,\" he said.\n\nSo, how did the unions lose face?\n\nDr Vassiley said a dispute involving workers at the \"most militant\" mine site in the Pilbara, Robe River, sparked the downfall for unions in the region.\n\nRobe River Iron was at the centre of the de-unionisation trend in the early 1980s. (Supplied: L.Whiteside/Rail Heritage WA)\n\nIn 1986, Robe River near Pannawonica was bought by Australian mining company Peko Wallsend.\n\nPeko's chief executive Charles Copeman believed the unions had become unmanageable and accused them of engaging in featherbedding \u2014 a practice by which unions force management's hand to retain excess staff.\n\n\"The [unions] managed to get a lot of people paid a lot more than they were working for \u2014 that was the biggest problem,\" Mr Copeman told the National Library of Australia in 2000.\n\nHe set about scrapping more than 200 agreements with previous management and workers.\n\nEventually, about 1,160 workers were locked out of the site for a three-week period.\n\nDr Vassiley said throughout the dispute, union lines fractured.\n\nWorking conditions across the Pilbara in the 1970s were subject to union action. (Supplied: City of Karratha Local History)\n\nLeadership wasn't keen to engage in strike action, while the more militant convenors were pushed to the side.\n\nWithin six months, Copeman and Peko won out, effectively de-unionising the site.\n\nOver the following decade, union membership eroded in the region, with major companies taking a more hardline approach.\n\nWhat are the new laws, and what are the criticisms?\n\nIn 2022, the Albanese government began introducing workplace reforms as part of the Closing Loopholes and Secure Jobs Better Pay acts to better protect workers across the country.\n\nPart of the government's new laws contain a mechanism for representatives, including unions, to force a company into bargaining.\n\nBut that can only occur when an already existing enterprise agreement has expired within the preceding five years.\n\nNegotiations are also subject to statutory approval.\n\nThe laws include provisions for multi-employer bargaining, where workers in the same sector but under different employers can negotiate collectively.\n\nIt's these changes that raise the most concern for industry groups.\n\nThe 1970s was a time of fast unionisation in the Pilbara. (Supplied: City of Karratha Local History)\n\nAustralian Resources and Energy Employer Association director of industry and advocacy, Tom Reid, said the changes were \"designed to re-insert unions into workplaces that have left them behind\".\n\n\"Why should highly productive iron ore mines be possibly threatened with the prospect of multi-employer bargaining?\" he said.\n\n\"Employees in the Pilbara are at the centre of some of the highest paid arrangements in any industry in the country \u2014 any assertion that this wave of industrial relations changes is truly about protecting workers, it just doesn't fly.\"\n\nIn April, the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist attributed a decline in business confidence in the region to fears over increasing union membership.\n\nBut while unions still have a presence in the Pilbara today, their membership pales in comparison to the 1970s and 80s.\n\nThe laws have already been put to the test in the mining sector, after workers at three coal mines in NSW united to force companies into multi-employer bargaining last year.\n\nIn March, 400 Rio Tinto workers in the Pilbara town of Paraburdoo signed a petition to support collective bargaining \u2014 the first of its kind in 20 years.\n\nEmployment Minister Murray Watt says criticisms of the new laws are a \"deliberate misinterpretation\". (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nFederal Industrial Relations Minister Murray Watt said criticisms of mechanisms such as multi-employer bargaining were a \"deliberate misinterpretation\".\n\nHe said the changes gave employees, including those in the resource sector, the choice of how they negotiated.\n\n\"We've made it easier for workers on some sites to collectively bargain, to be able to enter into agreements with their colleagues,\" he said.\n\nMining and Energy Union WA branch state secretary Greg Busson said the union and its members were highly supportive of the government's industrial relations changes.\n\n\"The rules have been too far skewed towards the bosses for a long period of time, and we see this as a start to make it fairer, and give the employee more say in their conditions,\" he said.\n\nBut he agreed with Mr Watt in not seeing multi-employer bargaining as having an impact on mine workers in the region.\n\n\"I don't know if it will work in the Pilbara at this stage,\" Mr Busson said.\n\n\"If the company sits down with the proper intention to negotiate a fair and just agreement, I don't think there's any need to enter into that.\"\n\nLoading\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

    "text": "WA Health Department directives restricting filming of hospital ramping for the TV show Paramedics have been labelled dishonest by the state opposition and a disservice to health workers and the public by doctors.\n\nSt John WA, the state government's contracted ambulance service, is currently filming with production company WTFN Entertainment for the coming seventh season of the 'real-life' show.\n\nIn a press release, St John WA states: \"This popular observational documentary, which airs on the Nine Network nationally, takes viewers behind the scenes as paramedics respond to emergency calls, showcasing the fast-paced, high pressure work of pre-hospital care\".\n\nBut a document outlining filming protocols and restrictions, sent by the Department of Health to WA public hospitals and seen by the ABC, has prompted concerns from the opposition and the Australian Medical Association WA (AMA WA), for what appears to be the department's ability to control what can and cannot be seen by the public.\n\nWA's Health Department is forbidding use of vision showing \"perceived capacity constraints\" in hospitals. (ABC News)\n\nEditing protocols include:\n\nVision that is used to negatively portray the WA Health system, including but not limited to perceived capacity constraints, is not permitted to be used, broadcast, streamed or shared in the program.\n\nBefore any episode is finalised, the Department of Health and Health Service providers reserve the right to decline any part of the vision being published, broadcast or streamed.\n\nFilming protocols include:\n\nFilming of and within ambulances must conclude at the time of entering a hospital ramp.\n\nNo filming is to occur onsite at hospitals outside of the ambulance.\n\nIn several previous episodes of Paramedics, filming continued once an ambulance reached a hospital, with vision of patient transfers sometimes aired.\n\nAMA WA fears excessive censorship\n\nRamping refers to the time an ambulance spends waiting outside an emergency department, unable to transfer the patient to the hospital, meaning the patient remains in the care of the paramedics.\n\nOn Thursday, the AMA released its latest ambulance ramping report card, which has shown, in some states, ramping hours are double what they were five years ago.\n\nAmbulance ramping in WA has increased this financial year. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nWhile ramping hours in WA did drop in 2023-24 to 49,530 hours, they have since gone back up, with more than 50,300 hours already recorded in the nine months to the end of March this financial year.\n\nAMA WA president Michael Page said he would \"hate to see excessive censorship by WA Health of what comes out of this filming\".\n\n\"I hope that there's no intervention from government that prevents the viewer from seeing the full picture of the state of our health system and the tough job that our paramedics do every day, as well as the work done by our doctors, our nurses and everyone else working in our health system,\" he said.\n\nAMA WA president Michael Page says it's important the frustration faced by paramedics is seen. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"Paramedics do spend a lot of time waiting with patients on the ramp because they can't get their patients into the emergency department because we do not have enough hospital capacity.\n\n\"I hope that experience of paramedics is shown for what it is, which is a job [that] is occasionally frustrating.\n\n\"They're frustrated by the state of our public hospital system, the shortage of beds that causes them to have to wait outside hospitals rather than getting out and attending to the next patient in the community who needs their care.\"\n\n'Extraordinary spin': opposition\n\nWA's Shadow Health Minister Libby Mettam slammed the government for the move.\n\n\"Ambulance ramping has become part and parcel of working as a paramedic under the Cook Labor Government, and for this government to issue such a directive on this program highlights a lack of transparency and accountability,\" she said.\n\nShadow Health Minister Libby Mettam has accused the government of dishonesty. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\n\"This directive is not only a disservice to WA patients, to health workers, to paramedics, but is also deeply dishonest for the government to issue such a directive during an ambulance ramping crisis.\n\n\"We've just had an election campaign. Health was not a priority. It is still not a priority.\n\n\"And it's extraordinary that this government is just continuing to try and spin their way out of what is a health crisis costing Western Australian patients lives.\"\n\nGovernment urged to fix problem\n\nBoth Dr Page and Ms Mettam called on the government to instead deal with the issue, something they said was not an ambulance problem but a hospital capacity problem.\n\nDr Page said planned upgrades to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and Royal Perth Hospital, which the government ran as election promises, were welcome, but not enough.\n\nWhat it would really take to fix WA's health system? Photo shows The back of three ambulances, and the bonnet of a fourth, parked outside a hospital. Many have promised solutions to Western Australia\u2019s problem-plagued health system, but do any of these ideas have a chance of addressing the heart of the issue?\n\n\"We do need refurbishment of our ageing hospitals but in addition to that, we need hundreds if not thousands more hospital beds to cope with our ageing and growing population,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, a WA government spokesperson said there were \"a number of complex contributing factors that contribute to ramping, and we are working hard to address the issue\".\n\n\"We have added more than 800 hospital beds to the system since 2021 \u2014 the equivalent of another Fiona Stanley Hospital. There are hundreds more in the pipeline.\"\n\nA spokesperson for St John WA said it was the only ambulance service in the country to publish daily data on ramping.\n\n\"We support transparency and believe the series (Paramedics) complements, rather than replaces, those efforts,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSo who has ultimate oversight?\n\nA WA Health spokesperson told the ABC the department did not have an agreement with the production company, but had prepared the filming protocols at the request of service providers, which run public hospitals.\n\nThe protocols were necessary, in part, to protect privacy and confidentiality as required under law, the spokesperson added.\n\nSt John WA is contracted by the government to provide ambulance services in the state. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThe health minister, the department and St John WA were all asked if the protocols gave the department something akin to complete control over what could be aired.\n\nThe minister and the department did not answer the question, but St John said the query would need to be directed to the department.\n\nSt John also said it had an agreement with WTFN under which editorial control rested with the production company, but the ambulance service and other stakeholders were able to review the content to \"ensure it reflects operational, legal and reputational responsibilities\".\n\nWTFN Entertainment did not respond to questions from the ABC about the protocols, including how they differed from seasons of the show filmed in other states.",

    "text": "In 2010, Australian cricketer Shaun Tait stood at the top of his mark on the picturesque turf of the famous Lord's Cricket Ground, ready to open the bowling against arch rivals England.\n\nOn the fifth ball of the over, Tait again seamlessly approached the crease, with his chest out, arms swinging beside him before ripping another thunderbolt of a delivery with his trademark slinging action, leaving England's then-captain Andrew Strauss to glance the ball from chest height for a single.\n\nThat delivery was clocked at 161.1 kilometres per hour, or 100.1 miles per hour, by the radar gun.\n\nFifteen years on, it remains the fastest ever recorded ball by an Australian and second of all-time behind Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar's bowl of 161.3kph.\n\nBowling above 160 kph, is a feat only achieved by a few across the world, but in recent years the number of bowlers even getting close to that figure has diminished.\n\nRene Ferdinands says questions are often raised about why bowling speeds have decreased compared to previous eras. (ABC News: Tara Whitchurch.)\n\nCricket biomechanics researcher and professional cricket coach, Rene Ferdinands, said questions were often raised about why bowling speeds had decreased compared to previous eras.\n\nEvolving bowling actions\n\nHe attributed changes in bowling techniques as a possible cause and said it was \"concerning\" the traditional side on action that gave rise to many world-class bowlers, including Jeff Thomson, Mitchell Johnson, Akhtar and Tait, had now become something of the past.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the side on action has gone completely out of favour, so that removes \u2026 an opportunity to develop speed,\" Dr Ferdinands said.\n\n\"It's \u2026 technically the most efficient one and probably easier to achieve than the front on action.\"\n\nDr Ferdinands said the theory behind the shift from a side on to a front on bowling action was to prevent injury and improve efficiency, but he said those theories were \"pseudo-scientific\", and that front on bowlers were more prone to injuries.\n\nFast bowling creates a lot of stress on the body and players often struggle with injuries. (ABC News)\n\nHe also said current coaching methods were prohibiting bowlers from developing a natural action, and with difficulties for bowlers to achieve optimal performance already it further reduced the number of potential players who could bowl at high speeds.\n\n\"As soon as there's a little bit of something different, it tends to be bred out of them,\" Dr Ferdinands said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if Jeff Thompson turned up today and someone changed him to another kind of action, that's how serious this is.\n\n\"This is reaching epidemic levels.\"\n\nIndividualising bowling methods\n\nShaun Tait, who now coaches teams throughout the world has overcome his fair share of injuries throughout his career.\n\nHe said he believed the sport had gone \"overboard\" with its focus on techniques and workload management in the aim of reducing injuries and promoting longevity.\n\n\"Just watching the game nearly every day, fast bowlers are still breaking down and that's the way it's going to be,\" Tait said.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one program that says if you do this, you are going to be bowl fast and you're going to bowl 150 or 160, I don't think that necessarily exists.\"\n\nTait said the onus was on the individual to figure out what method worked best to optimise their bowling potential, but emphasised the importance of mentality, aggression, and recovery to bowl at the highest of speeds.\n\nLuke Butterworth says genetics play a crucial role in fast bowling ability. (ABC News: Nethma Dandeniya)\n\nSouth Australia's Under 19 Head Coach, Luke Butterworth said genetics also played a crucial role, including height and running ability.\n\n\"You can pick up, five maybe 10 kilometres from gym and technical changes, but to get to the top end you got to have that natural pace as a young bowler,\" Butterworth said.\n\nCompact cricket schedules\n\nUnlike previous eras the current crop of bowlers have busier schedules with the influx of franchise cricket coupled with their international commitments.\n\nAustralian cricketer Billy Stanlake said the emphasis on workload management had amplified in the past 10 years as a result.\n\n\"Nowadays, I think you see guys playing so much cricket, all three formats, all year around, so there's a lot of planning to be done to make sure that \u2026 guys can sustain that level for 12 months, year on end,\" Stanlake said.\n\n\" I think the challenge is to obviously maintain that if you're playing all year round and you're travelling, that's when it probably starts to get a little bit difficult. \"\n\nAustralian cricketer Billy Stanlake says the management of workloads for bowlers has changed. (ABC News: Greg Szabo )\n\nHowever, Butterworth said bowlers were encouraged to give it their all and bowl as fast as they could but said it was important to get the balance right to ensure they remained fit.\n\nWhat does the future look like?\n\nEven though approaches to fast bowling have changed over the years, experts still believe the 160kph mark will be broken again.\n\nBut Dr Ferdinands said it was unlikely to happen without changes to current coaching regimes.\n\n\"If the biomechanics does change, and they actually look at the reality of the situation, and then coaches go through different types of coaching programs, then you really should be able to improve performance and reduce injury,\" he said.\n\nShaun Tait wants bowlers to have more say in their own techniques. (Joe Castro: AAP)\n\nSimilarly, Tait wants bowlers to have greater control over their action, rather than having coaches concerned about their technique.\n\n\"Let players go a little bit and let them be aggressive and ball fast,\" Tait said.\n\n\"I would let them go a bit more wild, I would encourage a Lance Morris to not slow down and worry about his areas, I would encourage [him] to let it go and express himself.\"",

(Unsplash: Robert Anasch )\n\nA tough job market\n\nThe latest statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that Tasmania is leading the nation when it comes to working multiple jobs.\n\nIn December last year, the ABS found 8 per cent of employed Tasmanians, or 1 in 12, held two or more jobs, a number that was slightly higher in its capital, Hobart, at 8.5 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the national average is 6.7 per cent.\n\nDr Paul Blacklow says low wage is one of the factors driving people to work multiple jobs. (ABC News)\n\nUniversity of Tasmania economics lecturer Paul Blacklow said two main factors drove people to hold multiple jobs: their primary job not being full-time hours or it having a low wage.\n\n\"They're more likely to want to take on extra jobs so that they can have enough income to sustain themselves and live,\" Dr Blacklow said.\n\nThis is particularly true in Tasmania, where wages are lower compared with the mainland.\n\nThe most recent figures from the ABS show Tasmanians have the lowest average weekly earnings for full-time workers in the country.\n\nState/territory Average weekly full-time earnings ACT $2,178 WA $2,156 NSW $1,985 Qld $1,953 Vic $1,927 NT $1,886 SA $1,857 Tas $1,765\n\nSource: ABS\n\n\"And so for that reason, Tasmanians may well be taking on additional jobs, more so than their counterparts in the other states,\" Dr Blacklow said.\n\nData from the ABS shows the number of multiple job holders across Australia is at an all-time high.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2019, the multiple job-holding rate fluctuated between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.\n\nBut after the COVID pandemic restrictions began to ease, the multiple job-holding rate rose and has remained at a historical peak of between 6.5 per cent and 6.7 per cent since December 2022.\n\nDr Blacklow said this recent increase is likely attributable to \"the cost-of-living crisis, and also because nominal wages haven't been growing that much\".\n\n\"We've noticed throughout history that other times when Australians have increased the amount of the incidence of holding multiple jobs, it's typically been when the economy has not been too well, or that inflation is high, or the wage growth is low,\" he said.\n\nYounger generations more likely to work multiple jobs\n\nABS statistics show that workers aged 20\u201324 years old are the most likely to be working multiple jobs.\n\nThis rings true for full-time university student Aya Gibson, who also holds three jobs.\n\nThe 21-year-old's packed schedule sees her work at least three nights a week as a waitress, serve customers at a market stall at least once a fortnight, and coach a soccer team for a couple hours each week.\n\n\"I found that with just a casual job, I still needed to find some extra hours here and there to bolster up the income,\" Ms Gibson said.\n\nShe works up to 30 hours a week on average across all three jobs, as well as studying a double degree in marine biology and Antarctic sciences, which takes up about 38 hours a week.\n\nAya Gibson works up to 30 hours a week on average across three jobs. (Supplied: Aya Gibson)\n\nMs Gibson lives at home, which she says makes her daily expenses \"probably lower than your average uni student\", but that she is conscious of the current economic climate as \"things are getting increasingly more expensive\".\n\n\"People now are struggling to get into the housing market and do stuff,\" she said.\n\n\"And so who knows what it's going to look like when I'm coming around to that kind of time in my life.\n\n\"I may as well work and put towards savings and that kind of thing, and some life things that are good to save for.\"",

    "text": "Australian representation at women's soccer's showpiece club final looks set to be fulfilled again by Ellie Carpenter after her Lyon side secured a valuable away win against an Arsenal side featuring two Matildas teammates.\n\nThe 2-1 victory was also a triumph for former Arsenal manager, now Lyon boss, Joe Montemurro, the Melburnian tipped to be the next Matildas coach.\n\nThough Arsenal created enough chances to feel they could get a result in the second leg in France early next Monday morning AEST, Lyon's lead, attacking panache and experience make them firm favourites.\n\nThat would delay Montemurro taking the Matildas job \u2014 if he is offered it, by another week. The French league ends eight days before the European final in Lisbon on 24 May.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nCarpenter was badly injured early in Lyon's 2022 final win over Barcelona, and on the pitch for all their defeat to the same opposition in last year's final, so will hope for third time lucky in Lisbon. Caitlin Foord, however, believes Arsenal can deny her the chance.\n\n\"I back us to be able to turn it around,\" the Gunners' striker said.\n\n\"We've come from behind before in the Champions League, in the league as well. There's been multiple games where we have done it, so the confidence is there.\n\n\"Off the back of any loss you just want to get into the game and play again, so everyone will be raring to go. We created, we got into the box, we just need to finish it off.\"\n\nOn a north London field far from home, Carpenter and Foord spent the afternoon tracking each other's movements, a situation the latter said was unusual.\n\n\" I don't think we've played against each other in a competition match before,\" she said.\"It's a bit strange, but once you're out on the pitch, it's just like any other game. \"\n\nThere was a third Matilda, Steph Catley, nearby at the heart of Arsenal's defence and Kyra Cooney-Cross watching on from their bench.\n\nArsenal had blown away Real Madrid 3-0 in its quarterfinal second leg here, but eight-times winners Lyon were a very different proposition.\n\nTheir multi-national collection of stars settled quickly and deserved their 17th-minute lead. A pass was slid behind Catley to Kadidiatou Diani who finished impeccably. She was flagged offside but a VAR check revealed American defender Emily Fox had played her on.\n\nBoth sides hit the bar as the half became more even, Lyon's Haitian striker Melchie Dumornay doing so from range and Alessia Russo heading onto the woodwork from close. In between, Catley blocked a goal-bound Carpenter shot in a rare foray forward by the full-back.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nRoared on by another impressive crowd of 40,000-plus, Arsenal dominated the second half, Foord being denied soon after the break and Beth Mead and Frida Maanum missing good chances.\n\nFourteen minutes from time, the VAR gave Arsenal a lifeline, highlighting Christiane Endler punching Leah Williamson as the goalkeeper attempted to clear a corner.\n\nMariona Caldentey rolled in the spot-kick, but as Arsenal went for a winner they were exposed at the back and Dumornay lashed in a shot, concluding a move begun by Carpenter.\n\n\"We suffered, but teams that come here will,\" said Montemurro. \"This team has the ability to control the emotion and that's important.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" he added. \"Maybe the pressure is off Arsenal. That's a dangerous scenario and they're a good team.\"\n\nThe second semifinal is on Monday morning, AEST, with Chelsea, still without Sam Kerr, whose recuperation from her ACL injury is now its 15th month, away to Barcelona.\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nWhen she was born, doctors didn't know what had caused Annabelle's disabilities.\n\nThey could only say it was an undiagnosed genetic condition.\n\n\"I think you can't help but question whether or not it's something that I did wrong in the pregnancy that meant that happened,\" Ms Hannigan says.\n\nDoctors had been unable to tell Kiera Hannigan what had caused her daughter Annabelle's disabilities. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nBut last year Annabelle's parents got unexpected news.\n\nBritish researchers, led by associate professor Nicky Whiffin at Oxford University's Big Data Institute, were conducting genome sequencing of DNA samples.\n\nThey were looking for patterns in the data to try to find DNA changes that caused rare diseases.\n\nDr Whiffin said her team had used a large UK genetics dataset, Genomics England, to support the research.\n\n\"[This is] a large DNA sequencing project based here in the UK which includes a large number of individuals with different rare disorders and also cancer and their full DNA sequence,\" Dr Whiffin said.\n\n\"Whilst doing that, a student in my team, Yuyang Chen, came across a specific variant in a very small gene called RNU4-2 that explains a large proportion of undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders.\"\n\nOxford University researcher Nicky Whiffin led the team that discovered the RNU4-2 variant. (Supplied)\n\nThey immediately found the same variant in multiple DNA samples of people who were previously undiagnosed. They shared similar dysmorphic facial features and were characterised by the same kind of developmental delays.\n\n\"It was very, very clear, very quickly that we found something that was really important,\" Dr Whiffin said.\n\nAbout 30 cases of ReNU syndrome found in Australia\n\nThe team shared their findings with other genetic researchers around the world, who immediately uncovered hundreds of cases, including a number in Australia.\n\nDr Whiffin predicted there would be roughly 1,000 cases of what has been dubbed ReNU or \"ReNU syndrome\" in Australia alone.\n\nSo far around 30 cases have been confirmed nationally, including Annabelle in Melbourne.\n\nAnnabelle Hannigan's mother says the four-year-old \"lights up\" around music. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\n\"We think there's probably about 100,000 individuals worldwide that have ReNU syndrome, and it explains about half a per cent of all neurodevelopmental disorders,\" Dr Whiffin said.\n\nMaya Pinn from the support group \"Syndromes Without A Name\", or SWAN, said approximately half of all children with neurodevelopmental disorders would not have a diagnosis in their lifetime.\n\nShe said 50 per cent would also receive a misdiagnosis.\n\nMaya Pinn says around half of children with neurodevelopmental disorders won't have a diagnosis. (ABC News: Sacha Payne)\n\n\"Having a 'SWAN' child impacts every single part of your life,\" she said. \"You feel like you're in limbo land, it's like trying to hit a pi\u00f1ata with a blindfold on.\"\n\n\"You're hitting everything but the pi\u00f1ata and you don't know where to go next.\"\n\nAdelaide woman Sarah Warwick was resigned to never knowing what had caused her 16-year-old daughter Abbey's disabilities.\n\n\"It was very, very lonely,\" she said. \"You have to develop a whole lot of resilience and determination to keep going, because often there's no clear path.\"\n\nSarah Warwick (middle) watches her daughter, Abbey, as she takes part in a session with speech therapist Kate Munro. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\nMs Warwick said she tried connecting with other families with children with special needs, but nothing was specific to her experience.\n\n\"They were getting diagnoses and they found their people and their community, and we never had that,\" she said.\n\nEfforts underway to find ReNU syndrome treatment\n\nAbbey was one of the first to be diagnosed in Australia, after Dr Whiffin contacted fellow researcher Daniel MacArthur at the Centre for Population Genomics in Sydney \u2014 a joint project between the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.\n\nAfter getting the call from an excited Dr Whiffin, Professor MacArthur asked the head of the centre's rare diseases team to screen their patient database for the RNU4-2 mutation.\n\n\"Within 20 minutes he was able to come back and say, 'we have now found six families with diagnoses involving exactly that same gene',\" Professor MacArthur said.\n\nProfessor Daniel MacArthur says the discovery of the RNU4-2 mutation should allow children to be diagnosed soon after birth. (ABC News: Liam Patrick)\n\nHe said the discovery had already changed clinical practice worldwide.\n\n\"If there is a new child who's born that has a developmental disorder and they're given DNA sequencing, we should now pick this up as a matter of course and they should get a diagnosis very quickly,\" he said.\n\nThe next step is towards treatments, but while Professor MacArthur conceded this could be difficult, he remained hopeful of further breakthroughs.\n\n\"There are at least two pharmaceutical companies that are actively pursuing potential therapeutics for this disease,\" he said.\n\n\"That means there's a pretty good chance that patients with ReNU syndrome around the world at some point over the next five years will actually have access to treatments that could reduce or even substantially reduce the impact.\"\n\nDr Whiffin is slightly more circumspect.\n\n\"I'm very hopeful that there'll be a quick route towards a treatment, but hesitant to promise too much, because there's a lot of challenges on that road,\" she said.\n\n'Elation' as communities form around diagnosis\n\nFor Sarah Warwick, the most important part of the discovery was knowing she wasn't alone.\n\n\"It was just absolutely amazing to see pictures of photos of children who really resembled Abbey and who had similar facial features, similar challenges, both medical and developmentally,\" she says.\n\nAfter years without answers, Sarah Warwick has started a support group for families of children with ReNU syndrome. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\n\"There's overwhelm, there's kind of elation that you've got an answer that you didn't think that you'd get,\" she said tearfully.\n\nMs Warwick started a Facebook group called the ReNU Syndrome Family Support Network (Australia) and is travelling to Long Island in New York later this year for the first global conference on the disease.\n\nShe said her new network had been invaluable.\n\n\"It was just really nice to find people who had trod a similar path to us and look at things that had worked for their families and talk to people who really got it,\" she said.\n\nShe said the diagnosis had also provided reassurance for the rest of Abbey's family.\n\n\"Our son is now at the same level of risk factor for having a baby with a disability as the general population. Those results were profound for me almost immediately on that first phone call to our geneticist.\"\n\nKiera Hannigan said she had resolved any notion that she might have contributed to her daughter's disability.\n\n\"You can really set that aside and know that it's a mutation, and lots of different mutations can happen when a baby is growing,\" she said.\n\nKiera Hannigan says the discovery has dispelled her fears that she may have done something to cause Annabelle's disabilities. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\n\"It's something called 'de novo', which means it really just happens by chance. It doesn't happen because it's been inherited somewhere from anyone in the family.\"\n\nBut she is also pragmatic about Annabelle's future.\n\n\"We understood that she had a genetic condition that would be lifelong but you are always trying to get your head around what your life will look like. That's the hardest part to comprehend,\" she said.\n\nDr Whiffin described the discovery as a \"once-in-a-career-type achievement\".\n\n\"It's the reason I do my job, to try and make a difference to families like these and to make such an impact overnight was pretty incredible.\"",

    "text": "Whether you know it or not, there's a pretty good chance you've seen buffel grass if you live on the Australian mainland.\n\nEnvironmental groups and the cattle industry are at odds over a nomination to make the long, lush, green-stemmed plant with the purple flower a weed of national significance (WONS).\n\nA ruling could be made by the end of this year and interest groups are calling for their voices to be heard as authorities deliberate.\n\nBuffel grass was introduced to Australia in the late 19th century. (Supplied: Jenny Milson)\n\nBuffel grass was introduced to Australia in the 1870s by Afghan cameleers and in the 1920s it was planted across Australia's arid landscapes, becoming a pivotal pasture for the cattle industry.\n\nAs it spread through cattle country, buffel grass began to outcompete native flora and fauna and it has already been declared a weed in the Northern Territory and South Australia.\n\nThe nomination of buffel grass for WONS declaration has sparked outrage across the cattle industry, but environmental groups including the Invasive Species Council (ISC) strongly support the listing.\n\nCarol Booth says a WONS declaration will not put the beef industry at risk. (Supplied: Invasive Species Council)\n\nISC policy director Carol Booth said it was one of Australia's worst weeds and was able to rapidly infiltrate a wide variety of landscapes and suppress native flora.\n\n\"Buffel's been recognised as a threat to more than 30 threatened species,\" she said.\n\n\" It's a massive environmental threat. \"\n\nDr Booth said the beef industry was not at risk because management plans would only be implemented on non-pastoral lands.\n\n\"It's not about changing the legal status of it and stopping graziers using it \u2026 but it will help with the harmful consequences of buffel grass for others,\" she said.\n\nTagalaka man Victor Steffensen says buffel grass threatens native plants. (Supplied: Victor Steffensen)\n\nVictor Steffensen, a Tagalaka man from the Gulf Savannah and co-founder of Indigenous cultural knowledge network Firesticks, said the weed created challenges for fire management.\n\n\"We do try and encourage farmers to change buffel grass and get a good mixture of grasses in there too,\" he said.\n\n\" It's extremely important that we work together. \"\n\nCattle Australia chair Garry Edwards says buffel grass is crucial for the beef industry. (Supplied: Cattle Australia)\n\n'Absolute disaster'\n\nCattle Australia chair and grazier Garry Edwards said a WONS declaration would have a massive impact on the industry and strongly disagreed with claims to the contrary.\n\n\"My level of trust on that type of statement is incredibly low, because if we're serious about this there would have been more meaningful discussions,\" he said.\n\n\"We should be putting buffel grass up for an Order of Australia medal \u2026 that's the type of impact it's had on regional and rural communities and the nation as a whole.\n\n\" There's literally billions upon billions of economic value and landholding that's attached to the fact that buffel grass exists. \"\n\nBuffel grass can pose fire management challenges, critics say. (ABC News: Nathan Coates)\n\nMr Edwards said buffel grass could help to rehabilitate mined land and reduce erosion.\n\n\"Areas, particularly in the centre part of Australia where buffel grass has more recently entered those landscapes, has actually reduced erosion tremendously,\" he said.\n\nGraziers worry the industry will need to engage in management or eradication efforts on their property if the WONS nomination is successful.\n\n\"It would be an absolute disaster for everybody, whether you live in North Queensland or Brisbane,\" Mr Edwards said.\n\nRangeland agronomist Jenny Milson says there needs to be a clear and reasoned debate about buffel grass. (ABC News: Crispian Yeomans)\n\nUncertain impacts\n\nBuffel grass must be recognised as a \"priority current and future weed threat to Australia\" if a WONS declaration is to be made.\n\nJenny Milson, who has been a rangeland agronomist in outback Queensland for 35 years, says it is a complex issue and both sides have legitimate concerns.\n\nShe said it was uncertain what impact a WONS declaration would have on graziers.\n\n\"Once something's declared a WONS the consequences are fairly unclear for people and I think that's what causes a lot of concern,\" she said.\n\nMs Milson said a significant question would be whether it would affect the ability to buy or plant buffel grass.\n\nBuffel grass has been declared a weed in the Northern Territory. (Supplied: Arid Lands Environment Centre)\n\nShe understood the fears about buffel grass being able to form monocultures after fires but said it was the \"backbone\" of the cattle industry.\n\n\"The main thing that really concerns me at the moment is we need to have equitable, reasonable debate and make sure it's coming from both sides,\" she said.\n\n\" I don't know what the solution is, but I believe there are solutions. \"\n\nThe federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said no consideration had been given as to what might follow a declaration and that state and territory governments had discretion for their own management.\n\nA spokesperson said a plant was only considered a weed when it required some form of action to reduce its negative effects.\n\n\"A pasture grass providing benefits as feed for livestock is not considered a weed,\" they said in a statement.\n\nBut they said the plant would be considered a weed if it was found in a national park and was outcompeting native plants.",

    "text": "From Victoria's scenic south-west to the seaside suburbs of Perth in Western Australia, electorates that were once strongholds for the Labor and Liberal parties are witnessing a historic shift.\n\nTraditionally safe seats are flipping around the country, as voters put their hopes and dreams in independent and non-major party candidates.\n\nBut it takes more than just hopes and dreams to create a seismic political shift that flies in the face of decades of voting history.\n\nSo what does it take for a challenger to pose a real threat to a safe seat?\n\nLess support for major parties\n\nDeakin University senior politics lecturer Geoff Robinson said falling levels of support for major political parties had opened up space for independent political forces across Australia.\n\n\"Less than 60 per cent of voters now claim an allegiance to one of the major parties,\" Dr Robinson said.\n\nWho are the independents and what do they stand for? Photo shows A middle aged white woman tinted blue and an old white man tinted yellow Like their name suggests, an independent MP is separate from any party, with their own individual policies and views. Here's a guide to who's who.\n\nAnd even if these voters had previously voted for one party, Dr Robinson said those allegiances might not be as strong as they used to be.\n\nHe said general dissatisfaction with the performance of major party candidates and the perception that safe seats received less funding than marginal seats could be factors fuelling the change.\n\nMarketing strategist Toby Ralph said seats that were ripe for a challenge often had a high number of tertiary-educated people, more professional women, and more younger people.\n\n\"Very often those parties will have a tired alternative who is forced into toeing the party line and there will be discontent there,\" he said.\n\nDemographic changes, such as the sea-change phenomenon, have also changed the voter base.\n\nThe 'three Ps' of disruption\n\nMr Ralph said successfully flipping a safe seat came down to three factors: patience, patrons, and preferences.\n\nHe said patience involved waiting for a candidate to make an error, or for the public to grow tired or unhappy with the incumbent.\n\nPolitics Explained Photo shows Claudia Long appears looking confused looking towards the words Politics Explained with the ABC logo below it. It's been a minute since the last election. Need a refresher? Politics Explained has got you covered with everything you need to know about politics and parliament. Stream now on ABC iview.\n\n\"You've got to wait for someone to stuff up \u2014 either the candidate or the party \u2014 as that gives you the opportunity to harness discontent,\" Mr Ralph said.\n\nPatrons \u2014 or in other words, cashed-up supporters \u2014 are also key because running successful campaigns takes a lot of money.\n\nOne prominent patron in recent years has been the Climate 200 group, which has financed independent candidates who support a science-based response to climate change.\n\nIn 2022, the group supported 23 candidates, including 10 successful lower house candidates \u2014 six were newly elected and four were existing independents.\n\nMonique Ryan won her Kooyong seat in 2022. (AAP: Luis Ascui)\n\nThis included Monique Ryan, who won the Victorian seat of Kooyong, which had been held by the Liberals since the end of World War II; Kate Chaney, who won Curtin in WA and ended 25 years of Liberal control; and Zali Steggall, who unseated Tony Abbott in 2019 in Warringah, NSW, a safe Liberal seat for about half a century, and was re-elected in 2022 with an increased margin.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries of Climate 200 backing this election is independent Alex Dyson, who has a fundraised war chest of more than $1 million for his third tilt at the Wannon electorate in south-west Victoria, which has been a Liberal stronghold for 70 years.\n\nIndependent candidate Alex Dyson is taking his third run at the seat of Wannon. (Supplied)\n\nOf that money, Climate 200 donated about $485,000.\n\n\"First time round, Alex Dyson spent $20,000, second time round he spent $90,000, and this time he's raised more than a million,\" Mr Ralph said.\n\nIn response, the Liberal Party is spending more in the seat too \u2014 local media reports suggest incumbent MP Dan Tehan has spent $750,000 on the campaign, or roughly five times the usual amount.\n\nLiberal MP Dan Tehan has held the Wannon seat since 2010. (ABC News: David Sciasci)\n\nA similar scene is playing out in Cowper on the New South Wales north coast, held by the National Party since 1983.\n\nIn 2022, independent Caz Heise gained 47.68 per cent of the preference count, close behind incumbent Pat Conaghan's 52.32 per cent.\n\nBut it's not just independents splashing the cash and targeting Labor and Liberal in an effort to disrupt the voting status quo.\n\nIn the Victorian seat of Bendigo, where Labor has reigned since 1998, Labor incumbent Lisa Chesters is seeing a well-funded campaign coming at her from the National Party, which hasn't fielded a candidate in the seat since 2016.\n\nThe Nats preselected former local publican Andrew Lethlean way back on July 1, 2024, and he's hit the hustings a couple of times with Nationals leader David Littleproud in tow and big funding promises at the ready, all aimed at cashing in on a perceived backlash against the state Labor government.\n\nHowever, funding does not always equate to success.\n\nClive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party spent $123 million on campaigning in the 2022 election, only to secure one seat in the Senate, Mr Ralph said.\n\nPreference flows\n\nLast but not least are the all-important preferences.\n\nMr Ralph said preference flows were vital in getting a candidate over the line, including the role of so-called 'preference whisperers' who try to negotiate agreements around preferences.\n\nTeals in regional Qld Photo shows Graphic of six women with an image of Queensland in the background. Deep in Queensland's blue-blood heartland, six women want to dismantle decades of LNP supremacy.\n\n\"We're now in a situation where one-third of votes will go to Liberal, one-third will go to Labor, and one-third will go to minors and independents, so the distribution of preferences is incredibly important,\" he said.\n\nMr Ralph pointed to Wannon, where in 2022 Mr Tehan gained 44.5 per cent of the primary vote count and Mr Dyson gathered 19.3 per cent.\n\nBy the time preferences were distributed, Mr Tehan hung on to the seat with 53.9 per cent of the preference count, while Mr Dyson had 46.1 per cent.\n\nIn the Brisbane electorate in Queensland, preferences were the decider in the Greens flipping the previously Liberal-held seat, after Greens candidate Stephen Bates gained 53.7 per cent of the vote after preferences.\n\nStephen Bates won the Brisbane electorate for the Greens in 2022. (ABC News: Rachel Stewart)\n\nAustralian National University political marketing expert Andrew Hughes said challengers needed to gather momentum and at least 10 per cent of the primary vote to be considered a preference ally.\n\nCandidates must also be careful about which parties or candidates they aligned with on preferences, to ensure they did not alienate voters.\n\n\"It's not just about getting the right numbers across the line from anywhere and anyone,\" Dr Hughes said.\n\n\" People will raise questions about what you really do stand for if you're running for climate change [yet] you do a deal with someone who's running for more coal mines. \"\n\nDr Hughes said non-major party candidates taking on an incumbent also must begin their campaign early, to build a public profile.\n\nGrassroots campaigning\n\nMr Ralph said successful candidates tended to run strong grassroots campaigns built around activities such as door-knocking and setting up corflutes around an electorate.\n\nCandidates also needed to bridge the gap between niche local issues and the bigger picture of the national agenda \u2014 in other words, fixing a school fence while also addressing housing, cost of living or climate change.\n\nDr Hughes said it was grassroots campaigning that led to the 2013 victory of Cathy McGowan in the Victorian seat of Indi, which had been in Liberal hands since 1977.\n\nFormer independent MP Cathy McGowan won the seat of Indi in 2013. (ABC News)\n\nHe said Ms McGowan began her 2013 campaign in small rural towns by meeting with residents who often felt neglected by federal politicians.\n\n\"She sat down, listened and heard their concerns, then her campaign reflected that,\" Dr Hughes said.\n\n\"Meeting smaller communities shows you're willing to be at their level in their community.\n\n\"Even if [the issue or concern] might be very minor on a national agenda, that is powerful.\"\n\nLoading\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

The Americans seem more devout than other English-speaking countries, but since the turn of the century, church attendance there has fallen from 70 per cent of people to 45 per cent.

At 8pm local time, it was Vaibhav\u2019s turn to go up under the hammer. Delhi Capitals made the first move with a bid that sent Sanjeev running and jumping around the room in jubilation. And the offers kept coming as a bidding war ensued, with Rajasthan Royals eventually coming out on top with a price of \u00a3100,000. Hundreds of neighbours and relatives, who were watching the auction on their smartphones outside the Suryavanshis\u2019 two-storey house, hugged each other, handed out sweets and set off firecrackers as Vaibhav made history by becoming the youngest player ever picked for the IPL.\n\nVaibhav Suryavanshi is a young superstar. \u201cI just wanted my son to be selected. For how much, that question never occurred to me,\u201d 51-year-old Sanjeev tells Telegraph Sport at his home in Tajpur, a village in Bihar\u2019s Samastipur district, where most of the locals are involved in farming. Rahul Dravid will be Vaibhav\u2019s coach, while England\u2019s Jofra Archer and Indian superstar Yashasvi Jaiswal will be team-mates. Dravid heaped praised on the teenager after the auction. \u201cHe [Vaibhav] has some really good skills, so we thought it might be a good environment for him to grow in. He came to our trials and we were really happy with what we saw.\u201d India\u2019s latest cricket prodigy, following in the footsteps of the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, has broken records left, right and centre. As well as being selected for the IPL, Vaibhav made history by becoming the youngest player to make his debut in the Ranji Trophy, the domestic first-class competition, and to represent his home state of Bihar in the domestic T20 championship. Last November, during a four-day match against Australia Under-19s in Chennai, the left-handed opener also smashed 104 off just 62 balls, reiterating his class against players six years his senior.\n\nTalking to the locals in Tajpur, everyone raises Vaibhav\u2019s talent and dedication, but also the father\u2019s resilience and determination to ensure his son\u2019s dream came true. Vaibhav was taken by his dad aged six to a cricket academy in Samastipur. \u201cThe moment I saw him pick up a bat, I realised there is something about him,\u201d Sanjeev says, whose constant ferrying of his son to cricket camps and matches meant he eventually had to close the family\u2019s jewellery business. He now does a spot of farming in among mentoring the boy\u2019s cricket career. Cricket prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi has created history. Throughout the boy\u2019s childhood, Sanjeev would regularly buy three new cricket balls at $2 apiece in a region where a third of families make ends meet on a daily income of just $3.60. He would throw the balls at his son in the nets he built outside their house and invited bowlers from the village, often twice his age, to ping deliveries at him.\n\nHe also extended the invitation to faster bowlers from other parts of the district, and would pay them travel expenses to test his son. Some of these adults would whizz the ball down at 80mph, despite Vaibhav being only nine years old. \u201cI would get scared, but I knew if I stopped, my son his career would be over,\u201d Sanjeev explains. \u201cVillagers would say I\u2019m putting a heavy bet on my son. Because playing cricket was costing Vaibhav his studies and they would ask what job would he get if he didn\u2019t succeed in cricket. But I knew he had the talent. Otherwise I would not have invested so much time and resources on him. \u201cI may not have played at professional level but I\u2019ve seen enough to understand what is required. I never let him play with any [softer] ball because I wanted him to play professional cricket.\u201d At 11, Vaibhav smashed a double hundred in a 40-over match. A few months later, he scored an unbeaten 332 in an under-19 ODI tournament in Bihar.\n\nRajasthan Royals\u2019 Vaibhav Suryavanshi plays a shot during his Indian Premier League cricket debut. Credit: AP Rakesh Tiwari, the Bihar Cricket Association president, said Vaibhav\u2019s talent compelled them to pick him in big tournaments. Many criticised them for selecting a 12-year-old but Tiwari did not have to justify his decision for long. \u201cHis bat silenced every critic.\u201d Vaibhav has modelled his game on another left-hander in Brian Lara, whom he describes as his \u201cidol\u201d. He is also a fan of Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh, the free-flowing former Indian cricketers. Vaibhav\u2019s first coach in Samastipur, Brajesh Kumar Jha, says it gave him great pride that a player from his academy had made it to the IPL. He describes Vaibhav as a very hard-working cricketer who never backs down. \u201cHe is a quick learner, a naturally attacking batsman and adapts quickly to situations... and behind his success lies determination and hard work.\u201d He adds that Vaibhav would practise for several hours a day in searing Indian summer heat, proving his toughness.\n\n\u201cThe success people see is purely the result of Vaibhav\u2019s hard work,\u201d Jha explains. \u201cWhen a player from a small district like Samastipur, who would play here with all these young boys, makes it to the IPL, where he will get a chance to share the field or dressing room with greats of the game like Virat Kohli or Rahul Dravid, it\u2019s a dream, not just for that cricketer but a coach like me too. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain how it feels to see him reach that level. It\u2019s the dream I too had growing up but couldn\u2019t fulfil.\u201d Loading Vaibhav\u2019s success at such a young age is already changing the game and inspiring those even younger than him.",

    "text": "Greens leader Adam Bandt has signalled he wants discussions on changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax to be a priority in the next parliament, asking Treasury to prepare a 'green book' of policy information for the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiating with the crossbench would be a necessity if the election results in a minority government, which polls indicate is a possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens party is fighting to retain three out of its four lower house seats at the May election.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment departments are required to prepare a 'red book' and a 'blue book' of briefings for the Labor and Liberal parties respectively, which they only receive if they win the next election.\n\n\n\nConfident of a minority government, Bandt said the public service should \"get cracking\" on a Green book, with updated and expanded modelling on negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Experts have panned the major parties' housing policies as a 'dumpster fire' that will push up house prices even further, and with millions of people realising we can't keep voting for the same two parties and expecting a different result,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We now have a chance for real reform that will level the playing field for first home buyers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the ABC's Insiders program, Bandt said reforms to improve the country were coming from the crossbench.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the late 1990s, John Howard's capital gains tax discount really lit a fire under the housing market,\" Bandt said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got to diffuse this time bomb in a way that is fair.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is the Greens' housing policy?\n\nAs well as scrapping negative gearing discounts, the Greens policy would abolish the existing capital gains tax concession for more than one property.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe capital gains tax is applied when selling an asset like a house after owning it for at least 12 months \u2014 sellers can claim a 50 per cent tax discount on any profit made from the sale of assets, which include stocks, bonds, jewellery and real estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative gearing is the ability of an investor to offset any income from an investment against any losses or costs involved in maintaining it \u2014 meaning they could pay less income tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Parliamentary Budget Office analysis in June last year revealed that the tax revenue foregone as a result of these two concessions had risen from $6.7 billion in the 2014-15 financial year to $10.9 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. That figure is expected to be $12.3 billion in 2024-25.\n\n\n\nLiberal housing spokesperson Michael Sukkar defended negative gearing as \"a standard feature of our tax system\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where you tax housing more, you get fewer homes and you get higher rents,\" Sukkar said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That will be terrible for renters and terrible for first home buyers, too, who, in the end, will have fewer homes to choose from.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing policy has dominated the election campaign, with both Labor and the Coalition promising to help Australians get on the property ladder through access to new builds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a leader's debate this week, Opposition leader Peter Dutton accused Anthony Albanese of having \"a problem with the truth\" when the prime minister denied that the government had requested Treasury modelling on negative gearing and capital gains tax last year, despite comments from the Treasurer last year appearing to confirm the request.\n\n\n\n",

It shouldn't be taken for granted. One of the things that people rely upon to get by is their penalty rates. I used to work at Pancakes on the Rocks on Saturday night, eleven pm to seven am shift because for penalty rates, that's one of the things that got me through university.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has rejected the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The independent umpire sets the conditions.

Source: Supplied / Jessica Roberts \"Their extreme dysregulation and meltdowns could manifest as crying, physical or verbal aggression, breaking their things, and at its worst, self-harm,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could last for hours with anything we tried to alleviate their pain or distress not working.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe describes her children as neurodivergent PDAers.\n\n\n\nExtreme demand avoidance\n\nChildren who fit the PDA profile may show what are often described as \"challenging behaviours\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term PDA was coined by British clinical psychologist Elizabeth Newson in the 1980s, and the PDA Society UK was established in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe society's website describes PDAers as people who share autistic characteristics but also have a need for control, \"which is often anxiety related\", and states for those with the PDA neurotype, \"demand avoidance is a question of can't not won't\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's national autism strategy recognises PDA as \"a profile or subtype of autism\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia, which was updated in 2023, described PDA as a set of characteristics that can co-occur with autism and is recognised as a behavioural profile within autism.\n\n\n\nRecognition of PDA\n\nPDA is not considered a standalone diagnosis like autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , but it sits under autism as a certain presentation shown by some people on the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not a diagnostic test, the extreme demand avoidance questionnaire exists to measure behaviours associated with the neurotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, some Australian health professionals, such as paediatricians, psychologists and speech therapists, have started mentioning the profile in reports and diagnosis documentation of those who they consider fit the profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, anecdotes about health professionals and educators telling parents PDA does not exist or is not recognised in Australia have been repeatedly shared in online support groups for those who fit the neurotype and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is likely why the simple mention of PDA in a blog on the National Disability Insurance Scheme website was shared to the 14,000 followers of the PDA Australia Facebook as \"breaking news\".\n\n\n\nAn Edith Cowan University (ECU) research study released this year on the experience of mothers of children with PDA noted: \"Parents spoke about their experience of interacting with professionals in education and health-care settings who had limited understanding about PDA, invariably leading to misguided advice, poor support, or harmful practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble said while it was \"clear from the research that is available that it is currently a profile, not a stand-alone diagnosis, some professionals choose to not acknowledge it because it is not in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or the ICD (International Classification of Diseases).\"\n\n\n\nLowering demands\n\nThose advocating for increased recognition of PDA believe that making a distinction between autism and those with the PDA profile of the condition is important because it requires a specific approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PDA Society UK describes PDAers as \"driven to avoid everyday demands and expectations [including things they want to do or enjoy] to an extreme extent\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile demands in the case of PDAers can be direct requests or questions from others, they can come in different forms. They can be things such as eating, sleeping, and showering, but PDA Society UK explains that indirect demands such as praise, expectations, or uncertainty have the potential to cause anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble said PDA required a different approach to traditional parenting, and not providing PDA informed support could result in harm or trauma being caused to a child.\n\n\n\nThe PDA Society UK encourages a \"proactive and collaborative approach\" to parenting to manage anxiety in PDA children, with a focus on \"picking their battles\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIts website advises: \"In place of firm boundaries and the use of rewards, consequences and praise, an approach based on negotiation, collaboration and flexibility tends to work better in PDA households.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome health practitioners have started to take an approach to those who fit the profile that reduces demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble said once she was able to let go of the notion that things had to be a certain way in her household and with her children, such as everyone must sit at the kitchen table for meals, the stress that had been a constant in her household started to reduce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, when they have capacity, they naturally participate more with the demands of daily life. For us, it was finding the natural rhythm of our family,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble is now one of Australia's most well-known voices on PDA and works as a neurodiversity educational consultant.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What these autistic people want you to call them\n\nA closer look at the DSM\n\nPDA is not mentioned in the DSM, the reference guide for health professionals diagnosing autism or the International Classification of Diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been a number of updated versions of the DSM, which have changed with new research and understanding; for example, homosexuality was listed as a diagnosable condition until 1973.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current version was published in 2013 and is based on research done between 2000 and 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Trembath, professor in speech pathology at Griffith University, said he expected a new edition of the DSM would likely be released in the next few years, as they were generally published every 10 to 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he said he doesn't think PDA would be included in an updated version \"given the lack of an extensive evidence base to support its existence as a separate and sufficiently distinct condition\".\n\n\n\nThe PDA label\n\nTrembath, who is also the co-chair of the group that developed the second edition of the national guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia, said the guidelines recognise \"PDA is a term used by some members of the community to help describe and explain some of the behaviours that are seen in autistic children and adults\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said practitioners should be considering all available information to develop a holistic understanding of the person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not so much about whether the term PDA should be used, and instead all about understanding them as an individual,\" Trembath said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The guideline recommends an individualised approach, irrespective of how a person's behaviour is described, so we would say that a 'different approach' is required for each person, irrespective of whether their behaviour is described in terms of PDA or other terms.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Autism Strategy, which was launched in Perth in January by Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth, recognises Pathological Demand Avoidance as a profile of autism. Source: AAP / Aaron Bunch Trembath said he was aware of some practitioners including mention of PDA in autism reports, but said from an anecdotal point of view: \"It is not a common way of talking about people's characteristics, strengths, and support needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who use the term say it helps to understand, talk about, and respond to the needs of the individual. Others will say it adds a layer of complexity, lacks an agreed definition and precision, and may be offensive to some people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble described Trembath's position as \"idealised\" and not informed by the lived experience of PDAers and their families.\n\n\n\nA push for more recognition\n\nThe recent ECU research produced what may be the first published research in Australia, giving insight into the experience of Australian families of autistic children with a PDA profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt highlighted the need for greater recognition, understanding and acceptance of the PDA profile and for flexible, informed and appropriate support for PDA children and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble, who is taking part in the Inaugural PDA Conference Australia in Perth later in the year, wants more professionals who work with young children to acknowledge PDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Getting professionals to acknowledge the profile on reports and formal diagnoses letters gives parents the documentation which, they can use to advocate for their children our society requires,\" she said.\n\n\n\n",

I was especially fond of the black Easter egg \u2013 with its black background and flowers in red, pink, and purple \u2013 it really stood out. It was something special, truly special. Every Easter, I would get an egg from my godmother, and my mom would buy an even more beautiful one for her daughter than the one I received. Mine was, let\u2019s say, second or third tier. As a child, I used to resent that and would say: \u201cI\u2019ll make one myself \u2013 and much better! Of course, that was just a childish reaction; I didn\u2019t mean it seriously... but in the end, that\u2019s exactly how it turned out \u2013 because today, I genuinely love making them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBiserka now leads workshops across Croatia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt means young children, local women and tourists are all learning a skill that once filled every home in her village.\n\n\n\n\n\nLjudmila Suzdaljceva is a participant in a recent workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had never done it before, but I like it. It's very interesting, but also quite difficult. You really have to practise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Easter eggs once had deep meaning, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nPensioner Nada Simunic says they were once exchanged in friendship ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Easter eggs were always given as gifts. Best friends would come together and exchange Easter eggs. This tradition always took place on the Sunday after Easter. They would say, 'A sister, a bride is forever, a sister,' and that marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Vucenik often works late into the night before Easter, making sure the tradition lives on.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes future generations will keep it going.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Australia's insurance industry recorded an annual after-tax profit of $6.1 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's three times higher than the five-year average of $2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an annual review of the sector from consultancy firm KPMG, hiked up premiums, calmer weather and surging investment markets have all contributed to the boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the average customer paid 19.3 per cent more for home insurance and 12 per cent more for car insurance than they did the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if insurers are seeing such big profits, why are consumers still seeing insurance premiums rise?\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Blades is an insurance analyst for consumer advocacy group Choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says companies often justify premium hikes by pointing to external factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey point to a lot of external factors. So looking at cars for example, we don't make cars here in Australia, so we're reliant on overseas supply and those supply chains being disrupted, local parts manufacturers, but also external parts manufacturers. So insurers will definitely point to those delays and complex supply chains and also what's happening in world trade at the moment, it's quite a bit of a mess to put it bluntly. So yes, it's quite easy to point to those external factors. In saying that look for consumers, it's always important not to take these things on face value year on year, when you're getting your insurance renewals, you should always be shopping around to see what better values you can get to put the pressure back on insurers to make sure that they are not just taking the mickey with their increases.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the KPMG report says a return to positive profits may signal an end to double-digit premium hikes, it also says climate change means it's impossible to know what's around the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review has found the annual premium revenue jumped from $65.5 billion in 2023 to $68 billion in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia Davis is the Senior Policy and Communications officer at the Financial Rights Legal Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that while climate change may mean less profit from home and content insurance, it isn't the whole picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think when we're looking at these big profits, what we're seeing is a reflection of profits across all their types of insurance, you know, whether it's cyber insurance or liability insurance or, you know, any number of other products, mostly commercial stuff. They're making a ton of money, and they claim they're not making a lot of money on, you know, consumer insurance, home and content. But, you know, I would challenge that. The truth is, insurance pricing is really opaque. You know, we don't understand it. We don't get to see it. It's not transparent at all, and it's pretty frustrating for consumers when your prices keep going up and up, and there is just no explanation. Is it because your house is more dangerous, you know, is there a new flood map you don't know about, you know, why is the price, increasing so dramatically?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Blades says insurance companies often find loopholes in the system, allowing them to increase premiums even more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, so looking to health insurance, this is a really regulated market. There's billions of dollars going in subsidies and billions more indirectly through tax incentives going from government coffers into the health funds. We also know that there's a number of loopholes that the health funds use to increase premiums far higher than the averages suggest. We also know that there's perhaps some issues with transparency in terms of people being told in the news that they have an average increase of this, but they're actually getting a 12 per cent increase higher than they thought. So look, there's always plenty that the governments can be pushing to do with pushing for greater transparency and regulations there. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Climate Council has released a report revealing how areas at high risk of climate disaster will continue to see rising premiums.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report, titled At Our Front Door, says the increasing frequency and severity of climate related disasters in Australia is driving up insurance premiums across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review by KPMG says that with only two significant weather events and no weather catastrophes in 2024, insurance companies generated $566 million in losses from 49,000 claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis marks a significant drop from 2023, which saw $2.356 billion paid out by insurance companies across over 143,000 [[143,900]] claims from catastrophes and significant events.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Hall is the CEO of the Insurance Council of Australia, he says without adequate measures to address climate resilience, the cost of home insurance will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, we see it in the profit of insurance, insurance profits in Australia over the last five years. Three of those years, we've seen significant losses, particularly in home and contents, all driven completely by weather events. We've had a rapidly rising population. Those homes are growing often on the east coast on cheap land. That land is cheap for a reason. It floods. That comes with a cost when it comes to insuring those properties. So as we move forward in Australia, when we're talking about housing more and more people, we need to make sure that those homes are built in safe locations, in locations that don't flood, where the assets can remain intact for a longer period of time than just five years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor consumers, Mark Blades says simply looking around at different options online can save hundreds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlways be shopping around at every single year's renewal notice. Look, if I told you you could save hundreds of dollars just for say half a day's work, you'd probably be doing it right if you're looking at an hourly rate. And that's true if you're thinking about your home insurance, car insurance, health insurance, if you have it. Just looking at those three things that can be hundreds of dollars in savings you can make in just a few hours. And that's just by going online. Choice has comparisons for this, making sure you're looking at equivalent cover or less cover if you need it. And making sure as well when you're comparing insurers that you actually are looking at different competitors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the insurance industry itself, Julia Davis says more oversight is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we've been calling on government to establish a permanent National Insurance pricing monitor. We just think the general insurance industry is not meeting community expectations when it comes to pricing and needs more oversight\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Retail worker Pauline Lethborg said the extra money from penalty rates went a long way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we lose penalty rates, it doesn't just affect the older workers, it's the younger ones as well. That bonus money goes to pay rent and food,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cost of living these days is very hard, right across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not like we're being paid $100 an hour, a lot of retail workers are on $20 to $25 an hour ... penalty rates is what gives them their supplement income.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year, the Australian Retail Association submitted a proposal for some staff at large companies to opt out of penalty rates in exchange for a 25 per cent raise.\n\n\n\nEmployer lobby Australian Industry Group has backed a similar push for the clerks and banking awards, arguing the rise in working from home has made it impractical for employees to log their hours and compounds the regulatory burden on employers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor had filed a submission to the Fair Work Commission opposing the changes, while also calling for the coalition to provide clarity on its penalty rate stance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround three million workers would be affected if Labor succeeds in legislating to protect penalty rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace Relations Minister Murray Watt said employees deserved to be rewarded for giving up family time to work during weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will always stand with workers to protect their wages so that we can help them deal with the pressures of today and get ahead in the future,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOpposition employment spokesperson Michaelia Cash said in February that penalty rates would not be cut under a future Coalition government, dismissing Labor attacks as a scare campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese and Peter Dutton spent Good Friday in Sydney, amid a lull in campaigning for the Easter period.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut electioneering will heat up again next week, with early voting opening on Tuesday ahead of the 3 May poll.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The story of the 14-year-old earning \u00a3100,000 in the IPL Sanjeev Suryavanshi was glued to the television watching the Indian Premier League auction taking place thousands of miles away in Saudi Arabia. It was the evening of November 25 and Sanjeev was praying that his then 13-year-old son, Vaibhav, would be picked up in the IPL, the tournament in which the world\u2019s top cricketers earn life-changing money for just a couple of months\u2019 work. At 8pm local time, it was Vaibhav\u2019s turn to go up under the hammer. Delhi Capitals made the first move with a bid that sent Sanjeev running and jumping around the room in jubilation. And the offers kept coming as a bidding war ensued, with Rajasthan Royals eventually coming out on top with a price of \u00a3100,000. Hundreds of neighbours and relatives, who were watching the auction on their smartphones outside the Suryavanshis\u2019 two-storey house, hugged each other, handed out sweets and set off firecrackers as Vaibhav made history by becoming the youngest player ever picked for the IPL.\n\nVaibhav Suryavanshi is a young superstar. \u201cI just wanted my son to be selected. For how much, that question never occurred to me,\u201d 51-year-old Sanjeev tells Telegraph Sport at his home in Tajpur, a village in Bihar\u2019s Samastipur district, where most of the locals are involved in farming. Rahul Dravid will be Vaibhav\u2019s coach, while England\u2019s Jofra Archer and Indian superstar Yashasvi Jaiswal will be team-mates. Dravid heaped praised on the teenager after the auction. \u201cHe [Vaibhav] has some really good skills, so we thought it might be a good environment for him to grow in. He came to our trials and we were really happy with what we saw.\u201d India\u2019s latest cricket prodigy, following in the footsteps of the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, has broken records left, right and centre. As well as being selected for the IPL, Vaibhav made history by becoming the youngest player to make his debut in the Ranji Trophy, the domestic first-class competition, and to represent his home state of Bihar in the domestic T20 championship. Last November, during a four-day match against Australia Under-19s in Chennai, the left-handed opener also smashed 104 off just 62 balls, reiterating his class against players six years his senior.\n\nTalking to the locals in Tajpur, everyone raises Vaibhav\u2019s talent and dedication, but also the father\u2019s resilience and determination to ensure his son\u2019s dream came true. Vaibhav was taken by his dad aged six to a cricket academy in Samastipur. \u201cThe moment I saw him pick up a bat, I realised there is something about him,\u201d Sanjeev says, whose constant ferrying of his son to cricket camps and matches meant he eventually had to close the family\u2019s jewellery business. He now does a spot of farming in among mentoring the boy\u2019s cricket career. Cricket prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi has created history. Throughout the boy\u2019s childhood, Sanjeev would regularly buy three new cricket balls at $2 apiece in a region where a third of families make ends meet on a daily income of just $3.60. He would throw the balls at his son in the nets he built outside their house and invited bowlers from the village, often twice his age, to ping deliveries at him.\n\nHe also extended the invitation to faster bowlers from other parts of the district, and would pay them travel expenses to test his son. Some of these adults would whizz the ball down at 80mph, despite Vaibhav being only nine years old. \u201cI would get scared, but I knew if I stopped, my son his career would be over,\u201d Sanjeev explains. \u201cVillagers would say I\u2019m putting a heavy bet on my son. Because playing cricket was costing Vaibhav his studies and they would ask what job would he get if he didn\u2019t succeed in cricket. But I knew he had the talent. Otherwise I would not have invested so much time and resources on him. \u201cI may not have played at professional level but I\u2019ve seen enough to understand what is required. I never let him play with any [softer] ball because I wanted him to play professional cricket.\u201d At 11, Vaibhav smashed a double hundred in a 40-over match. A few months later, he scored an unbeaten 332 in an under-19 ODI tournament in Bihar.\n\nRajasthan Royals\u2019 Vaibhav Suryavanshi plays a shot during his Indian Premier League cricket debut. Credit: AP Rakesh Tiwari, the Bihar Cricket Association president, said Vaibhav\u2019s talent compelled them to pick him in big tournaments. Many criticised them for selecting a 12-year-old but Tiwari did not have to justify his decision for long. \u201cHis bat silenced every critic.\u201d Vaibhav has modelled his game on another left-hander in Brian Lara, whom he describes as his \u201cidol\u201d. He is also a fan of Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh, the free-flowing former Indian cricketers. Vaibhav\u2019s first coach in Samastipur, Brajesh Kumar Jha, says it gave him great pride that a player from his academy had made it to the IPL. He describes Vaibhav as a very hard-working cricketer who never backs down. \u201cHe is a quick learner, a naturally attacking batsman and adapts quickly to situations... and behind his success lies determination and hard work.\u201d He adds that Vaibhav would practise for several hours a day in searing Indian summer heat, proving his toughness.\n\n\u201cThe success people see is purely the result of Vaibhav\u2019s hard work,\u201d Jha explains. \u201cWhen a player from a small district like Samastipur, who would play here with all these young boys, makes it to the IPL, where he will get a chance to share the field or dressing room with greats of the game like Virat Kohli or Rahul Dravid, it\u2019s a dream, not just for that cricketer but a coach like me too. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain how it feels to see him reach that level. It\u2019s the dream I too had growing up but couldn\u2019t fulfil.\u201d Loading Vaibhav\u2019s success at such a young age is already changing the game and inspiring those even younger than him.",

Source: Bec Dunning/Janine Cable/Destination Shellharbour\n\nAs Aussies spend their Easter weekend lolling on the shorelines of beaches and rivers across the country, one town is attempting to lure even more visitors with its colourful local mascot \u2014 Sammy the seal.\n\nSeveral videos of the playful creature frolicking in the water under Windang Bridge have been making the rounds online this week as residents in Shellharbour push for the coastal city to be named NSW\u2019s Top Tourism Town.\n\nIn the footage, Sammy can be seen performing his \u2014 or her \u2014 trademark move of lying upside-down with their flippers in the air, amusing locals and travellers, some of which said they hoped to catch a glimpse of the \u201cbeautiful\u201d seal when they stop by.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got a mind of his own,\u201d Bec Dunning, from SUP Shellharbour, told Yahoo News. \u201cWe pretty much go past him almost every day.\u201d\n\nDunning, who spotted Sammy once again on Wednesday \u201cwagging his tail\u201d at her and a customer while \u201chiding\u201d behind one of the bridge\u2019s concrete pylons, explained the seal has been living in the area \u201cfor years\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA lot of the residents say that he\u2019s always been here. We\u2019ve had up to three seals underneath, and recently it\u2019s just been the one,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do those little barrel rolls. We sort of wonder if they\u2019re using the pylons on the bridge for a bit of a massage.\u201d\n\nThere are also often \u201clots of fish\u201d that Sammy likely snacks on throughout the day.\n\nWhy is Sammy upside-down with his flippers in the air?\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo, Sea World Curator of Animal Welfare and Operations, Mitchell Leroy, explained that Sammy\u2019s adorable upside-down manoeuvre is called \u201csailing\u201d and is a \u201cway for the animal to thermoregulate\u201d.\n\n\u201cMeaning that they use the flippers above the water to either cool down or in most cases warm up. This means they don\u2019t have to get out of the water just to stay warm,\u201d he said.\n\nSammy\u2019s adorable upside-down manoeuvre is called 'sailing' and is a 'way for the animal to thermal regulate'. Source: Bec Dunning/SUP Shellharbour\n\nLeroy added that it is \u201cquite common\u201d for seals to inhabit locations for periods of time. \u201cThere are many who move away during the year for different life stages, such as breeding season, only to return to the locations where they spend other times such as winter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is most likely dependent on prior learning and success in behaviours such as successful hunting, predator avoidance or mate selection.\u201d\n\nSeal's cheeky Meerkat move cracks up local\n\nDunning told Yahoo that Sammy can sometimes \u201cgets a little scared\u201d, especially if there are jet skis around or construction on the bridge.\n\n\u201cBut generally we can go under there, chill out for a little bit, have a good look at him and then move on and see him on the way back as well,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce I came through with a couple of guests, and couldn\u2019t see him, and then all of a sudden he popped up behind us, had a look like a little Meerkat, and sort of followed me for a little bit, and then pushed away, and went swimming off somewhere else,\u201d the local added, laughing about the seal's cheeky antics.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
