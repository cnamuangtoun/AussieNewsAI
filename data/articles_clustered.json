(Getty)\n\n\"Australia's health system is valued for its mix of public and private healthcare, but both parts of the system are under increasing pressure,\" McMullen said.\n\n\"Public hospitals are struggling with a severe logjam crisis, which is pushing more patients towards the private sector.\n\n\"However, runaway insurance premiums, low value offerings and shady tactics like product phoenixing leave customers facing tough choices about the level of cover they can afford.\"\n\nCost of living pressures are seeing people drop gold-tier policies. (Nine)\n\nAustralians are paying more for private health insurance and getting less for their money in return, a new report from the country's top doctors' advocacy group says. (Getty)\n\nThe report card showed that every year since 2008, the growth of private health insurance premiums has outstripped inflation, health sector inflation, average weekly earnings and the indexation of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).\n\nBetween 2008 and 2024, premiums climbed more than 100 per cent, while MBS indexation \u2013 which was frozen for several years from 2013 \u2013 increased by less than 20 per cent.\n\nThe report card also shows that over the six years to June 2025, insurers increased benefits paid for in-hospital medical treatment by only 18.1 per cent, while sector profits grew by nearly 50 per cent over the same period.\n\nREAD MORE: Manhunt for prisoner who escaped from police at hospital \ufeff\n\nIn 2024-2025, insurers returned 84.2 per cent of premiums to consumers as benefits, below the 2019 level of 88 per cent.\n\nThe AMA is calling on the federal government to mandate a 90 per cent return minimum for insurers.\n\n\"Of course, private health insurers must make a surplus to be sustainable, but it is clear they are holding out on Australians while recording significant profits each year,\" McMullen said.\n\nThe AMA is calling for major reform. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"These insurers have ample capacity to increase the benefits paid to patients.\"\n\nThe report also found gold-tier policies are in decline as consumers face rising premiums and cost-of-living pressures.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the number of gold-tier policies have dropped by 360,000, despite the overall number of policies growing.\n\n\"These trends show that private health insurance is becoming less affordable for many Australians \u2013 and we are already seeing the drastic effects of this, with at least 14 private maternity units closing over the past five years,\" McMullen said.\n\n\"The need for a Private Health System Authority to better regulate the sector and drive long-term reform has never been more crucial. There are too many bodies involved in the regulation of private health \u2013 a single, independent authority would provide a unified and coherent approach.\"",

    "text": "The Ayers Rock Resort at Uluru is set to change hands, after the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation (ILSC) came to an agreement with \"experiential tourism\" company Journey Beyond.\n\nJourney Beyond is owned by American private equity firm Crestview Partners and already operates several high-profile tourism assets, including the Ghan and Indian Pacific railways.\n\nThe deal sees Journey Beyond purchase the operational assets of ILSC subsidiary Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia, which include the Ayers Rock Resort and the Mossman Gorge Cultural in Far North Queensland.\n\nLand and buildings at both locations will be transferred to traditional owners, Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara of Yulara and the Kuku Yalanji of Mossman Gorge.\n\nValuation review questions Ayers Rock Resort buy An advisory group that delivered the highest valuation for central Australia's Ayers Rock Resort in 2010 was paid a fee based on the purchase price.\n\nThe move brings to an end a 15-year foray into large tourism ventures by the ILSC.\n\nIn 2010, the Indigenous Land Corporation board announced with great fanfare that it was buying the Ayers Rock Resort, near Uluru, for $300 million.\n\nThe deal with Journey Beyond is likely to be for less than $300 million and, while Voyages Indigenous Tourism was never supposed to be just about making a profit, the impending sale has some people asking questions, like was it worth it?\n\nWhat is the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation?\n\nThe Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC), now known as the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation (ILSC), was set up in 1995 in the wake of the historic Mabo High Court decision that recognised Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal traditional title to land.\n\nOne of the ILC's functions is to manage the Land Account, which aims to help Indigenous people to acquire land and manage it in a sustainable way, to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for themselves and future generations.\n\nThe direction and responsibilities of the ILSC have evolved over the years and now include a wide range of Indigenous-led projects, agribusinesses, tourism enterprises and to help native title holders, if needed.\n\nThe ILSC board is the primary decision-making body and oversees governance, considers land acquisition and land management proposals and monitors performance.\n\nThe board consists of seven directors appointed by the federal minister for Indigenous Australians. Five of them, including the chairperson, must be Indigenous people.\n\nWhy did the board buy Ayers Rock Resort?\n\nIn 2007, the ILC decided to focus on education, training and employment.\n\nThis meant a considerable expansion to build businesses and create training opportunities.\n\nThe ILC announced it had acquired Ayers Rock Resort at Yulara near Uluru from property giant GPT for $300 million in October 2010.\n\nResort between Rock and hard place after shake-up The former board chairman of Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia calls for federal government action on the Ayers Rock Resort in the Northern Territory.\n\n\"The resort represents a unique and probably the biggest opportunity to advance the training and employment of Indigenous people in the Australian tourism and hospitality industries,\" ILC chairperson Shirley McPherson said at the time.\n\nThe idea was to increase Indigenous employment at the resort from a handful to more than half the staff members and to establish a National Indigenous Tourism Training Academy, with 200 people in training each year from 2013.\n\nWas the purchase contentious?\n\nWhen she was appointed ILC chair in 2011, Dr Dawn Casey started digging into the purchase.\n\nAnd she was outraged by what she found.\n\nProperty giant GPT originally offered the resort to the ILC for $270 million in 2009, but the sale price was revised upwards by $30 million in 2010.\n\nIn a 2015 letter to then-prime minister Tony Abbott, Dr Casey alleged the former ILC board agreed to the increased price \"without any sound reasoning documented in the [then ILC board] minutes\".\n\nAllegations $30m missing in Uluru resort deal Taxpayers \"inexplicably\" paid an \"unjustified\" $30 million in a deal to buy Ayers Rock Resort in 2010, a letter to the prime minister alleges.\n\nThe letter states:\n\n\"[This was] despite strong concerns from certain directors and due diligence advisers indicating that the purchase price may not have been commensurate with the resort's value.\"\n\nBanks had refused to finance the full acquisition in 2009, and then-indigenous affairs minister Jenny Macklin declined to back the purchase and forbade access to the Land Account for it.\n\nWhen GPT increased the resort's sale price in 2010, the property giant proposed a new seller-financed model, also called vendor finance, where the seller loans the purchaser all or part of a loan that they would not otherwise be able to secure.\n\nThat meant the ILC was able to borrow $198 million to buy the resort, including land, buildings, infrastructure and the nearby airport at Yulara.\n\nIn 2016, then-Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion authorised a $65 million federal government bailout for the ILC to help refinance the resort, blaming the global financial crisis.\n\nVoyages still has an external debt of more that $100 million.\n\nWhat is the resort worth?\n\nWhile Uluru has been a sacred and spiritual place for Aboriginal peoples for thousands of years, tourists have been flocking to the rock since the first graded road from Alice Springs was completed in the 1950s.\n\nBy 1968, visitor numbers had grown to more than 20,000 annually but facilities at the base of Uluru were unregulated, driving governments to develop the concept of a resort during the 1970s.\n\nThe original tourism site is now the Indigenous township of Mutitjulu.\n\nThe resort was opened in 1984 and celebrated its 40th anniversary last year.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nIt is the only place tourists can stay to visit Uluru and contains a range of accommodation options from campsites through to high-end rooms, restaurants, pools and an art gallery.\n\nBut by the time the ILC took possession of the resort in early 2011, it needed renovating and modernising.\n\nIn October 2013, the ILC announced it had written $62 million off the value of the resort.\n\nIt also said it was having trouble dealing with its annual interest repayments of about $10 million.\n\nIn January 2014, the resort was revalued again down to $202.5 million.\n\nAnd, like all tourism ventures, it was adversely affected by the pandemic from 2020.\n\nThe Ayers Rock Resort welcomes tens of thousands of domestic and international tourists each year. (Supplied)\n\nShadow Minister for Indigenous Australians Kerrynne Liddle, an Arrernte woman, worked for Voyages Tourism for a few years, to increase Indigenous employment outcomes and help the resort better engage with the local Mutitjulu community.\n\nShe said it was a worthwhile and valuable exercise that involved a lot of resetting relationships with the local community.\n\n\"My focus was also making sure that Aboriginal people weren't only employed at the lower levels of the business, that they could do anything,\" she said.\n\nSenator Liddle said, in her time at the resort, Indigenous people were able to access registered training, and were employed in all sorts of roles, from front of house to senior leadership.\n\n\"People came from all over Australia to work there and \u2026 it's pretty special when you walk into a hotel anywhere in Australia and see Indigenous people just doing their jobs \u2026 it is really wonderful to see,\" she said.\n\nAyers Rock Resort is the only place tourists can stay when visiting Uluru. (Supplied)\n\nBut, despite the positive outcomes in training and employment, Senator Liddle has questions.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it struggled to operate effectively from a profit perspective because of the extraordinary way in which it was financed,\" she said.\n\n\" We may effectively have a business that's operated for many years \u2026 and you have to ask the question was this such a great investment to begin with? \"\n\nLooking back, Dr Casey says there's \"no doubt\" that the training and employment programs were valuable and excellent.\n\n\"But it did hamstring us in terms of the funding that we had to pay out on loans,\" she said.\n\n\"We set it up so that we could see exactly how much it cost to operate, separated it out from the rest of the budget and, yeah, it was a major concern for during the period that we were there.\"\n\nWhat's for sale?\n\nVoyages' operational assets are being sold to Journey Beyond.\n\nThe land will be divested to the traditional owners at both Yulara and Mossman Gorge, with the ILSC saying there has been multi-year consultation and engagement with Anangu in Central Australia and the Kuku Yalanji in Far North Queensland.\n\nLater, following the transfer of land to community corporations, both communities will be paid rent from Journey Beyond's leasing of the sites under 90 and 10-year leases, respectively.\n\nThe sale has already been brought to the attention of the Foreign Investment Review Board.\n\nLand at Mossman Gorge will be handed back to Kuku Yalanji people. (Supplied: Tourism and Events Queensland)\n\nIn addition, in central Australia there are to be areas that will remain outside of a leasing arrangement and remain with community.\n\nOne of those areas will be used to develop a business hub, for Anangu (local people) and there is another area which is being set aside, outside of the lease, where Anangu can look to develop their own cultural tourism activities, not just rely on a partnership with Voyages to run experiences at the resort.\n\nIn a statement, Yulara Aboriginal Corporation said they were happy with the decision to hand back land that was originally excised from Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park and looking forward to working with Journey Beyond \"in the development of world class Indigenous tourism experiences that will share our language, our culture and our rich landscapes with visitors\".\n\nThe transaction is expected to be finalised in early 2026, along with the divestment of the Yulara land to Anangu.\n\nThe Mossman Gorge land divestment will follow once the native title application that embraces the cultural centre site is determined.",

    "text": "Eagerly anticipating the World Cup draw, Aziz Behich can't help but dream of settling some unfinished business with Argentina.\n\nIn Qatar in 2022, Behich and Garang Kuol were denied late chances to equalise against eventual champions Argentina as the Socceroos' golden run ended in the round of 16.\n\nIn the draw for next year's global showpiece, to be held on Saturday at 4am (AEDT), Argentina will be in Pot 1 with the Socceroos in Pot 2, making for a one-in-12 shot at a group stage reunion.\n\n\"Look, that would be great if we get another shot at them,\" Behich told AAP.\n\n\"That's football \u2014 the game can turn so quick. And we had two opportunities to make that game something special.\n\n\"But that whole campaign was just special in general, the way we got out of the group there, and I'd love to be a part of something like that again.\n\nArgentina beat Australia\u2019s Socceroos 2-0 The irrepressible Lionel Messi again brings the Socceroos' undone, scoring the fastest goal of his international career as Argentina claims a friendly victory in Beijing.\n\n\"And why not take it one more step forward in a World Cup?\"\n\nLanding in Pot 2 should help Australia avoid any \"group of death'' scenarios \u2014 but Behich doesn't care.\n\n\"I've really never believed in a group of death or anything like that because if a team's at the World Cup, they're there for a reason,\" he said.\n\n\"That means they're the best in their area and they qualified. Come the World Cup, they're one-off games, so for me, any game's a tough game.\n\n\"Anything's possible when it comes to football and it's proven week in, week out, not just at international level.\n\n\"We showed that in the last World Cup. No one gave us a chance in Qatar and we went out swinging against the champions of that World Cup \u2014 and we could have snagged something there in that game as well.\n\n\"So whatever group comes, it's a challenge \u2014 but if there's one thing that us Aussies pride ourselves on, it's performing with our backs against the wall against the best.\n\n\"So it's more of just excitement and a 'bring it on' type mentality.\"\n\nBehich hopes an expanded 48-team tournament minimises the chance of a third consecutive World Cup group involving France and Denmark.\n\n\"It'd be nice, obviously, to get a different draw because the last two World Cups had a few of the same teams,\" he said.\n\nLionel Messi hoists the trophy after Argentina's win over France in the 2022 World Cup final.

    "text": "Red-tipped bananas are not new to Australian consumers, but have gone viral on social media this month after an inquisitive post from two bewildered British backpackers.\n\nThe video from travellers Mel Chekaoui and Phil Colia has been seen more than 11 million times on Instagram, with eager consumers commenting that they too were hungry to learn the reason for the red wax tip.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"My Dad told me it meant they were strawberry flavoured and I believed him until I was 16 years old. Nice to finally learn the real reason in the comments\"\n\n\"Legit my favourite bananas, and I don't even know why\"\n\n\"Baby-bel bananas\"\n\n\"Christian Louboutin version of bananas\"\n\nPioneered by Innisfail farmers Dianne and Frank Sciaccia in Far North Queensland, the red wax tip indicates bananas that have been grown using their Ecoganic farming method.\n\n\"Stores actually have a sign that says 'uniquely Ecoganic', but I mean [social media] is just the way the young ones communicate today,\" Ms Sciaccia said.\n\n\"[When I saw the video] I just laughed.\"\n\nMs Sciaccia said the accredited farming system used natural ecosystems to grow the crop and promote soil health, minimising other inputs such as chemical fertilisers and insecticides.\n\nIt is different to organic farming because not all products used are free of inputs.\n\nThe bananas are grown to a recognised standard in order to be accredited. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nWhile the red tips are more widely known to appear on bananas, producers of other crops have also started to adopt the farming method.\n\n\"We've had a lot of interest from different industries, so we've been working with avocadoes, apples and pears in Victoria, and almond growers in South Australia for the past couple of years,\" Ms Sciaccia said.\n\n\"We're just putting some focus back into papaya, which we did start a few years ago, but due to crop loss, we sort of put that on hold at the time.\"\n\nPawpaw potential\n\nThere are eight certified growers nationally, including William Darveniza.\n\nHis farm is up the road from the Sciaccia's, about 260 kilometres north of Townsville, and his range of crops includes the red-tipped bananas.\n\nThis is his first year formally producing the fruit, after he realised he had already been using the farming method.\n\nWilliam Darveniza farms multiple crops near Innisfail in Far North Queensland. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nHe hopes to add the red tip to other fruits on the farm, including paw paws.\n\n\"A lot of those mycorrhizal fungi and the bacteria that they evolved alongside in the rainforest are sort of taken out of the equation in the conventional farming system that we have,\" said Mr Darveniza.\n\n\"I'd like to sort of try and reintroduce that a little bit and help protect the crop from these weather situations and these insect pressures using that system.\"\n\nHe hoped a wider range of red-tipped fruit would be on supermarket shelves by mid-next year.\n\n\"There has already been a fair bit of interest in the product, so we're looking forward to moving forward with it,\" he said.\n\nMr Darveniza is going to grow red-tipped pawpaws next year. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nRed-tipped exports\n\nAcross all growers, about 80 tonnes of red-tipped bananas are produced a week, and they are not only turning heads in Australia.\n\nMs Sciaccia said international interest had grown since they first sent trial volumes of bananas with the waxy, red tips to Japan about two years ago.\n\n\"We've been working with one of the major supermarkets over there and putting together a business plan with them,\" she said.\n\n\"They've done all of their testing on the product, and the texture, taste, what they call sensory attributes, sit above any other product that they import from around the world.\"\n\nShe was hopeful of sending commercial volumes to Japan in the future.\n\n\"I don't see the export as being a major part of our business, but it certainly has the potential to be as equal to our domestic market quite easily,\" Ms Sciaccia said.",

    "text": "Messages between Australian multi-billionaire Ed Craven and a former associate reveal the inner workings of his online casino empire.\n\nAll it took was a splashy gambling spree for Chris to announce himself as a new high roller at Stake.\n\nOver a few whirlwind months of gambling, the Swedish millionaire lost more than $US150,000 at the online casino.\n\nIn doing so, he gained something more valuable: a direct line to Stake's CEO and co-founder, Ed Craven.\n\nEddie: Sup Chris\n\nEddie: You were one of the top players on Stake in August\n\nEddie: Special bonus here - https://stake.com/?bonus=EddieTopAugustVIPs \ud83d\ude42\n\nEddie: Hope you have a nice September dude\n\nStake was on the rise, soon to be a global gambling juggernaut, but its CEO still found the time to roll out the VIP treatment for its top clients.\n\nA few months in, Chris offered up a tantalising clue about how profitable he could be for the casino.\n\nChris: i'm down like \u20ac2.3m on bitcasino\n\nEddie: Really, wow lol\n\nThe full transcript of their conversations between 2020 and 2024 \u2014 obtained exclusively by the ABC \u2014 shows Chris taking on many roles at Stake: client, collaborator, informant, and rule-breaker.\n\nIn the process, it offers a look inside how one of Australia's richest people built his gambling empire, and how he ignored numerous red flags suggesting his associate had a serious gambling problem.\n\nIn 2025, Chris commenced legal proceedings seeking to reclaim $US1.5 million of losses at Stake, using his conversations with the Stake CEO in support of a claim that the company had exploited his addiction.\n\nEd Craven declined to comment; Stake's head of PR, Audrey Fitzgerald, said the company would not comment on active litigation.\n\nOn the surface, much of the chat between the pair is light-hearted. Craven jokes about \"sketchy\" casinos, and games \"designed to f*** player[s]\". He advises Chris on his role as a promoter for the casino, shares screenshots of jackpots and resolves the occasional technical issue.\n\nChris: always good to be able to contact so fast not many have that :)\n\nEddie: No problem man, least can do\n\nBut underneath it all, colouring almost every interaction, were signs that his VIP client had a gambling problem.\n\nChris tells Craven about going \"overboard on the live blackjack\", suffering \"bad losses\", and makes quips about \"losing track of money\" when he's faced with the raw numbers. They also openly discuss several of Chris's attempts to have himself barred from gambling on Stake.\n\nThe messages also show Craven advising Chris not to circumvent a self-imposed ban in 2022. \"I think it's kinda dumb too,\" wrote the Stake CEO, \"but at the same time there's a lot of people it helps.\"\n\nChris did it anyway. And still, he says, Craven acted \"as if nothing had changed\". Chris continued to gamble at Stake \u2014 and chat with Craven about it \u2014 for another two years.\n\nChris's parents had no idea their 17-year-old son was a teenage millionaire in 2020, much less that he was at risk of gambling his fortune away.\n\nFrom a young age, the Swedish teenager had discovered a knack for trading video game items online.\n\nHe converted his winnings into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, back when they were worth relatively little. By 2020, these coins had multiplied in value and Chris's crypto fortune had swelled into the millions.\n\nChris kept his online exploits to himself. His parents only caught rare glimpses of his new-found wealth, like when they helped him cash out a tiny portion of it to buy a new computer.\n\nAs he grew up, Chris found himself unable to resist playing the virtual slot machines at several online casinos. The teenager burned through massive amounts of crypto in a matter of months, much of it on a site called Bitcasino \u2014 one of the first online casinos to accept cryptocurrencies.\n\nOnline, Chris was more open about his gambling habit. He would post screenshots of the occasional jackpot on Twitter, interspersed with despairing comments about how much he was losing.\n\nBut this schtick was about more than just venting. By posting about special offers at Bitcasino, accessible through his personal referral code, Chris found another way to fund his gambling.\n\nAnyone who used that code to sign up would be doing Chris a big favour.\n\nWhenever these people \u2014 called his \"affiliates\" \u2014 spent money on Bitcasino, Chris would get a cut for referring them. It was a kind of gambling pyramid scheme, where influencers profited off the misfortune of their fans.\n\nThis Faustian bargain offered by online casinos had spawned an entire universe of gambling influencers, each jostling for a share in the bonanza of affiliate revenue.\n\nThis meant that, as Chris was growing his list of affiliates, he was simultaneously being courted by others trying to do the same. And it wasn't long before Stake, a relative newcomer to the online \"crypto casino\" space, started cannibalising the player bases of its more storied competitors.\n\nMidway through 2020, with the pandemic trapping millions of gamblers in their homes, Craven saw an opportunity to reach a larger audience.\n\nThat was when he hired Akhil Sarin as Stake's first official marketer, a job that came with one massive hitch.\n\nAs Stake was licensed in Cura\u00e7ao \u2014 a tax haven in the Caribbean with minimal oversight for casinos \u2014 it was banned in many popular gambling markets, including in Australia, the US and much of Europe. This meant that it couldn't be advertised through traditional means.\n\nBut Sarin soon had an idea he wanted to try out: partnering with people who would live-stream themselves as they gambled on their site. Craven wasn't initially sold on the idea, according to Sarin, but he allowed his new lieutenant to spend a month trying it out.\n\nAkil Sarin (grey suit, white shirt) was hired by Ed Craven (light blue jeans) in 2020. ( )\n\nBefore long, tens of thousands of people were tuning in to watch their favourite streamers play Stake's virtual slot machines, clicking a button over and over again. A community of young gamblers materialised on Twitch, the world's most popular live streaming platform.\n\nThe Stake team were blown away by the success of their new marketing strategy. \"I think the pivotal moment was the [rate of] conversion of viewers,\" Sarin later told an industry podcast. \"Live-streaming is the absolute best way to market any product.\"\n\nStake used a similar incentive for its streamers as Chris had been offered by Bitcasino \u2014 they were entitled to a cut of each bet made by anyone they referred to the site, continuing into perpetuity.\n\nOver time, Stake struck deals with online celebrities such as xQc and Trainwreck, both of whom signed contracts \u2014 reportedly worth more than $US1 million per month \u2014 that required them to gamble live for their fans.\n\nDo you know more? Contact Julian Fell at tips@jtfell.com if you have any information about crypto casinos in Australia.\n\nChris switched over to Stake after being lured in with a sweetheart deal of his own. \"They gave me a VIP deal there,\" Chris recalls, \"because I was playing with a lot of money.\"\n\nThat meant the 17-year-old had a direct line to \"Eddie\" \u2014 the big boss, Ed Craven.\n\nTheir earliest interactions were playful. The two of them would banter about Chris's losses and discuss Stake's competitors.\n\nAt one point, Craven suggested that Chris's betting limit, already at an astronomical $US25,000 per hand of blackjack, could be raised even higher.\n\nChris: lost 110 [bitcoin] in like 2 hours becuase [Bitcasino] had stupid amounts as limits\n\nEddie: Damn\n\nEddie: On Blackjack?\n\nChris: yep, and baccarat\n\nChris: i did private baccarat and private [blackjack] tables\n\nEddie: Haha damn\n\nEddie: If you ever need Stake's limits increased let me know\n\nEddie: We can get up to $100k/hand\n\nEddie: But yeh I guess it's dangerous having that available 24/7 I can set it for like 1 hour or 2 hours for you if you like\n\nChris: 100k? haha might need it someday:)\n\nEddie: Easy, just one message away\n\nDuring a discussion of Chris's \"cash back\" entitlements \u2014 a promotion where a portion of his gambling losses were periodically returned to him \u2014 Chris said he was thinking of sticking to slot games for the next little while.\n\nChris: wanted to try to stick to slots for a lil bit and see how it goes\n\nEddie: Hahaha, I recall that never working out too well for you \ud83d\ude02\n\nChris: Yup im the worst one when it comes to slots hehe\n\nEddie: Hahah, yeh live games more fun tbh\n\nEddie: Slots also real hard to profit\n\nEddie: Designed to f*** player\n\nChris: true gonna try another [deposit] tomorrow and see how it goes:)\n\nEddie: Hopefully a decent streak :)\n\nThe signs that Chris had a problem were never far from the surface.\n\nChris asked if it was \"possible to disable evolution [games] specifically or is it still not possible? [Makes] me go crazy with the bad luck there\". He complained about \"bad losses\" on the slots and blackjack, and often voiced frustration about his inability to stick to sports betting.\n\nStake's own website acknowledges the devastating impact problem gambling can have. \"Although problem gambling often results in financial problems,\" it says, \"the impact of problem gambling usually stretches much further than this.\"\n\nIn between these dire interactions, Craven continued giving Chris inducements, including a percentage of cash back on his losses, and helped him to claim the income he was owed through referring other players.\n\nChris: Hey could you check for some cashback had a nother loss. maybe some extra available on top? :D\n\nChris: bit of a bad luck streak again\n\nEddie: Hey man I got you \ud83d\ude04\n\nEddie: All set in vault\n\nIn late 2021, Chris got his account permanently banned via a process called self-exclusion. This is a tool offered to players who have identified that they have a gambling problem, so they can avoid relapsing.\n\nHe told Craven it was an accident and later asked to have his VIP perks transferred over to a new account so he could keep gambling on Stake. \"Umm not the best idea to try get around the exclusion man,\" replied Craven.\n\nA few weeks later, Chris asked to apply some perks to an account of a \"buddy\". \"All set \ud83d\ude42,\" Stake's co-founder replied.\n\nThe charade about it being a friend's account was quickly dropped, and their interactions fell back into their usual rhythm \u2014 Chris repeatedly asking to have a percentage of his losses refunded, Craven offering words of encouragement and incentives to keep playing.\n\nChris's earlier, supposedly permanent, self-exclusion was seemingly lost to time.\n\nIn all, he created seven different accounts across on Stake. \"Whenever I made a new account, I would just message,\" he says. \"I would just give [Craven] the name and say, 'This is my new account.'\"\n\nChris's gambling only represented a tiny slice of the money being poured into Craven's burgeoning online empire.\n\nStake's popularity was, by 2021, starting to expand at an exponential rate.\n\nThe pandemic had hit, meaning countless people in high income countries all around the world were stuck inside without work, many with cash from income-protection schemes like Australia's JobKeeper program.\n\nThis explosion of potential players came just as Stake's marketing tactics, boosted by Sarin's innovations, were coming into their own. The company expanded its reach further, sponsoring an English Premier League football club and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\nAmong the masses of players flocking to the site was a name with serious star power. One day in 2021, Craven received a message from a Stake customer, who, as it turned out, was hanging out with Drake.\n\nBefore he knew it, Craven was on a video call with the Canadian pop star, who was standing on a basketball court inside his home.\n\nDrake said he loved playing on the site. Craven said later that he'd thought he was being scammed. It was too absurd to be real. But once it became clear that it really was Drake, Craven sensed an opportunity.\n\nDrake was announced as Stake's \"brand ambassador\" that same year.\n\nStake founders Ed Craven (left) and Bijan Tehrani (right) with the casino's ambassador and pop star Drake. ( )\n\nThe pop star appeared in viral marketing stunts and live-streamed himself making multi-million-dollar bets, projecting all the glamour of the high-rolling lifestyle onto a barely regulated casino.\n\nAs Chris struggled to control his gambling on Stake, he too was tapping into the rivers of money flowing in and out of the casino. He joined the casino's army of live-streaming influencers in late 2020.\n\nHe was never employed by Stake, and had no guaranteed income, however Craven offered financial support for Chris' efforts to entice others to play on Stake.\n\nEddie: Sup\n\nEddie: Hooked you up couple k in Bitcoin\n\nEddie: Hope you can get a decent run \ud83d\ude42 Nice win on Monopoly on Twitter\n\nChris: Ty haha yeah a quite good win\n\nEd Craven shares a screenshot of a win he had on Stake. ( )\n\nEddie: I got this one yesterday\n\nEddie: 1000x haha\n\nEddie: Super addictive\n\nChris: What the i never hit those lmao\n\nChris: Most I think is like 100x\n\nChris: Gonna upload that sometime\n\nEddie: Ha nice, you still making vids? Nice\n\nMake aure you attach ref links on all ya vids. Those things can pay for rest of ya life lol\n\nWhen he live-streamed his gambling sessions, Chris says he would bet far more recklessly than usual.\n\nHe felt the pressure to put on a show and entertain those watching him. \"I would lose [everything],\" Chris says, \"like within the first five to seven minutes.\"\n\nSean, who lives in Florida, used to watch Chris gamble live on Stake. \"It was just an insane amount of money,\" he says. \"[He would] be doing like six-figure blackjack hands.\"\n\nSean says he could see Chris had a gambling problem within a month of meeting him. \"One time he lost 800 grand in what must have been a few minutes,\" he recalls. \"And then after he lost it, he just instantly left the call.\"\n\nCraven seemed aware of this tendency in Chris, even counselling him to bet in smaller increments so he could keep playing \u2014 and therefore promoting the casino \u2014 for longer.\n\nEddie: Just like 10 Euro max spins preferably bro\n\nEddie: And you be live stream whole time\n\nEddie: Idea is to make some long streaming content haha\n\nChris regularly sent Craven long lists of players to add to his affiliate list; not all of them would keep playing once their welcome bonus was gone, but those who did were putting money straight into Chris's pocket.\n\nChris's affiliate list grew quickly, he recalls, reaching about 300 players at its peak.\n\nHis cut of each deposit made by his affiliates was relatively small, but in aggregate it worked out to a serious income.\n\nOther streamers found themselves with similar problems to Chris.\n\nA Stake-affiliated influencer named Austin Michael Taylor, who called himself DNP3, caused a public scandal when he committed fraud to fund his gambling habit.\n\nAfter running out of his own money to gamble with, Taylor took investor funds from a cryptocurrency project that he had launched in 2021, and used them to chase his losses. His sponsorship with Stake, he later wrote on social media, \"unleashed an addiction [he] never knew [he] had.\"\n\nOther similar scandals, involving a variety of online casinos, led to a crisis moment for Stake's promotional strategy.\n\nTwitch \u2014 the world's most popular live-streaming platform, where most of Stake's promoters hung out \u2014 banned any content featuring what it called \"unsafe\" gambling sites.\n\nThe ban included Stake.\n\nMonths later, a new live-streaming platform called Kick emerged, with far more liberal policies.\n\nIt's CEO and part-owner: Ed Craven.\n\nSeveral prominent gambling streamers quickly signed contracts with the new site, including Canadian streamer Felix Lengyel, known online as xQc, and American internet celebrity Adin Ross.\n\nFelix Lengyel (centre) meets Donald Trump on a Kick live-stream. ( )\n\nLengyel's $US100-million contract with Kick included a clause requiring him to gamble on Stake while streaming, the streamer once said. Other streamers have made similar comments.\n\nStill, Lengyel's relationship with gambling appears to be a complicated one. \"I'm ill,\" he once said, referring to his addiction to gambling, \"but you know what, I can afford to be ill.\"\n\nBy April 2023, Craven handed Chris off to another of Stake's VIP hosts.\n\nThe Stake CEO was a busy man. He was, by now, a certified billionaire, the owner of Australia's most expensive property, and the CEO of a major live-streaming platform.\n\nEddie: Hey bro\n\nEddie: If you reach out to @TejmanVIP he'll be able to renew the reload + send cashback etc & set all bonuses going forward. I've let him know to expect a message from you \u2014 He'll also have a nice extra bonus for when you reach out\n\nEddie: I'll still be here if you need anything unrelated to bonuses though, I'm not going anywhere :)\n\nChris: Yee I understand seen ur f1 stuff on Twitter some sick stuff\n\nEddie: hahah, yeh juggling a few things at once\n\nChris only reached out sporadically after that. When he did, Craven reminded him that he had a VIP host for these requests.\n\nTheir last exchange, in November 2024, followed the same pattern. Chris said he had lost $US700,000 on blackjack, and wanted a quarter of it back. \"I went insane,\" he wrote to Craven.\n\nCraven connected him with an on-duty VIP host, who would \"be able to sort everything out\".\n\nAnd that's where they left things, until Chris filed a legal claim \u2014 via a lawyer \u2014 for $US1.5 million in lost winnings.\n\nIn the meantime, Chris had reached out to the Foundation for the Representation of Victims of Online Gaming, which assists players with claims against online casinos.\n\nRoelof Bijkerk, an affiliate of the foundation based on the Dutch-Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao, took on Chris's case against Stake.\n\nTogether, they prepared a demand letter \u2014 featuring the messaging history between Chris and Craven as its centrepiece \u2014 that claimed the casino \"made gross misuse\" of Chris's gambling addiction.\n\nIn response Stake argued that Chris was a \"professional gambler\" who was merely playing the \"gambling addiction card\" to recover his losses.\n\nIt said the company continuously monitors player patterns that might indicate gambling addiction and \"there was no specific pattern in the timing of [Chris's] deposits that would indicate such a problem\".\n\nThe casino also claims Chris actually made a profit while gambling there. He did hit the jackpot at times \u2014 he withdrew $US2.2 million from one account in November 2023 \u2014 though he is missing the gambling data from two of his Stake accounts, so the ABC could not determine his overall position.\n\nIf his claim were to be awarded, Stake's lawyers say, \"it would go against the principle of fair play.\"\n\nThe only grounds for returning a player's losses, they argue, would be if its games had been rigged against them. \"In gambling, the fundamental rule is: if you lose, you lose; if you win, you win.\"\n\nIn effect, they were saying that the casino's arsenal of psychological tactics \u2014 hosting games designed to \"f*** player[s]\" and undermining players' attempts to quit with bonuses and cool-off periods \u2014 were all fair game.\n\nThe case is ongoing.\n\nAs for his own complicity as a cog in Stake's promotional machine, Chris says he didn't think about it all that much at the time.\n\nAnd now? \"Yeah, a little bit,\" he says, and changes the subject.\n\nSometimes it's easier to look the other way.\n\nCredits",

    "text": "Australia's controversial decision to drop Nathan Lyon is threatening to backfire as England's Zak Crawley has admitted he found it easier to find his rhythm facing an all-pace attack.\n\nLyon told Channel 7 he was \"absolutely filthy\" to have been axed for the second Ashes Test after also missing the last day-night Test on the tour of the West Indies in July.\n\nIt is just the second time since his 2011 debut that Lyon has missed a home Test, with the veteran spinner replaced by right-arm paceman Michael Neser.\n\nBut there were times Australia could have used Lyon on a seesawing first day of the pink-ball Test that ended with England going to stumps at 9-325 at the Gabba.\n\nAustralia are eight overs behind in their over rate, which could cost WTC points, after not playing spin at any point on Thursday.\n\nThere were times when Australia struggled for the breakthrough wickets that fell in clusters during their big win of the series opener.\n\nWith the condition of the ball apparently deteriorating, Jofra Archer and Joe Root toyed with the pacemen on a 61-run stand for the final wicket.\n\nThey will have the chance to continue batting in valuable daylight hours after the pacemen could not break the partnership under lights before stumps on Thursday.\n\nEarlier, Zak Crawley (76) stretched out to his second-biggest score in Australia, before Root (135no) broke through for a first century in 30 innings Down Under.\n\nCrawley admitted the tourists, under pressure for their poor batting in Perth, had been shocked not to have seen Lyon's name on the team sheet at the toss.\n\n\"I can't remember the last time other than in the West Indies recently that they haven't played him, so we were surprised,\" he said.\n\nOther than big left-armer Starc, all of Australia's bowlers on Thursday were right-arm medium-pacers.\n\nNeser, Cameron Green, Scott Boland and Brendan Doggett gave up 249 runs for only two wickets between them as Starc (6-71) inflicted the bulk of the damage.\n\nCrawley conceded that the lack of variety made his job easier.\n\n\"I suppose there was some rhythm I could get in with the four seamers playing. It definitely got easier as the game wore on,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know if that was the ball or picking up the rhythm of the pitch. After about 10 or 15 overs, it seemed to do a lot less.\"\n\nStarc was not worried by the homogeneous pace of the attack.\n\n\"I'm not sure speed's the be-all and end-all. That's the makeup we've gone with this week,\" Starc said.\n\nThe left-armer said he did not feel extra pressure without Lyon, as the clearest source of variety in the attack.\n\n\"I didn't feel anything different, much like last week, just trying to play that role,\" Starc said.\n\nStarc felt for Lyon, who learned of his omission only an hour before the toss on Thursday.\n\n\"It's a tough one for Nath. Everyone wants to play every game and I'm sure he'll be disappointed not to be playing this week,\" Starc said.\n\n\"The selectors certainly looked at the conditions and made the choice of that attack for these conditions. It's not a reflection of Nathan and his skills.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to. A newsletter delivered each Saturday.\n\nAAP",

(ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\nMr Homer said, while he found running the park fulfilling, the demand for accommodation he faced on a daily basis was overwhelming.\n\n\"Our phone does not stop ringing every single day,\" he said.\n\n\"We've had people in tears at our front counter, people who come back multiple times a day.\"\n\nParks of last resort\n\nMr Homer's experience is indicative of the seismic shift in caravan park culture, brought on by an acute shortage of homes.\n\nHe said he was increasingly turning away locals pleading for any kind of accommodation.\n\nGreg Homer wishes he had more room to help people find a place to live. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\n\"They'll be a family with a couple of small kids and asking if they just set up a tent anywhere on our property just to live, just to have something, so they are not sleeping in a car, so they can actually accommodate their kids,\" Mr Homer said.\n\n\"It's very, very tough to face that.\"\n\nMr Homer said he understood why caravan parks were such a popular choice for people struggling financially.\n\n\"We tend to be the most affordable of all styles of accommodation \u2026 so we've seen more and more people who are interested,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think I've had a vacancy at the caravan park now for probably four to five months.\"\n\nGreg Homer says the number of people being turned away is sometimes emotionally overwhelming. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\nKylie Holt has been living in a converted 1967 Leyland Leopard school bus for five years with her young family on long-term sites in the South West.\n\n\"We're all reliant on having somewhere to call home, no matter how humble that becomes, and just trying to provide that stability for yourself and your family,\" Mrs Holt said.\n\nKylie Holt says she is not confident she would find another caravan park with vacancies if she was forced to start looking now. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\nShe said she had seen a significant increase in the number of people using caravan parks as long-term accommodation.\n\n\"I'd say where we are, the amount of permanent families and people that we had doubled in the last three years,\" she said.\n\n\"From young mums with children, older men who have come out of divorce or widowed, and they can't afford a mortgage on their pension \u2014 a lot of different scenarios.\"\n\nTourism operator to landlord\n\nThe South West experienced a 62.9 per cent increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness between 2016 and 2021, which was the second largest increase in the state, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nSouth West caravan park manager Angela Kaitsioukas said she struggled with the shift from short-term holiday makers to long-term accommodation.\n\nWaterloo Village Caravan Park offers alternative types of long-term accommodation for people who do not have a caravan of their own. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\nMs Kaitsioukas said anti-social behaviour was causing safety concerns for her staff.\n\n\"There have been a couple of times where I have been quite scared to the point that now we actually have a pepper spray in our top drawer in the office,\" she said.\n\n\"We need everyone [customers] to have a current police clearance, no older than, like, six months old.\n\n\"We had been actually given a lot of false police clearances \u2026 I didn't realise that people would actually go to that length.\"\n\nAngela Kaitsioukas says more anti-social behaviour is making work challenging. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\nMs Kaitsioukas said she was considering removing long-term residency as an option because of the stress.\n\n\"I'm not sure that we will continue on doing it just because each year it seems to be getting a lot worse,\" she said.\n\n\" We do want to be, ultimately, just a caravan park. \"\n\n'An emergency valve'\n\nAnglicare CEO Mark Glasson said even caravan park space had been exhausted by the prolonged housing shortage.\n\n\"The inaccessibility of caravan parks for many people means that they are sleeping rough, they're sleeping in their cars, in tents, in people's backyards,\" he said.\n\n\"There's also a worrying trend that what was once an emergency valve is no longer available.\"",

    "text": "Oscar Piastri has sidestepped the question of whether he'd be prepared to play Formula One kingmaker by helping teammate and overwhelming championship favourite Lando Norris race to the world drivers' crown.\n\nNorris, who leads by 12 points from champion Max Verstappen and 16 from McLaren teammate Piastri going into the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with all three still in the hunt, said on Thursday he felt he would help the Australian if the boot was on the other foot.\n\nBut quizzed on his stance, Piastri neatly ducked the burning topic on pre-race media day, shrugging: \"It's not something we've discussed \u2014 I don't really have an answer until I know what's expected of me.\"\n\nOthers, though, had plenty to say, with Mercedes driver George Russell adamant it would be \"unfair\" to ask Piastri to sacrifice his admittedly slim title chances, even if it meant neither McLaren driver ended up being champion.\n\nHis advice to Piastri? Unplug his car radio.\n\n\"I don't think it's acceptable or reasonable to ask a driver who's also in a shot at a championship in the very last race to move over for your teammate,\" Russell said.\n\n\"They both need to be given a shot, and if they lose out because of it, you just need to say the other guy did a better job and that's racing.\"\n\nHow Oscar Piastri can still win the F1 world title Oscar Piastri's hopes of winning the F1 title suffered a hammer blow after McLaren's strategy error in Qatar, but there is still hope. Here's how the Aussie can upset the odds in Abu Dhabi's decider.\n\nNorris, for his part, said he wouldn't ask Piastri for any help in a potential scenario where, say, he was fourth in the race with Verstappen leading and Piastri third \u2014 a situation which would result in the Red Bull champ retaining his crown unless the McLaren drivers switched positions.\n\nQuizzed over whether he would ask Piastri to sacrifice a place to help him, Norris, sounding a mite uncomfortable as his two title rivals sat alongside, said: \"I don't think I would ask it because \u2026 I don't know \u2026 it's up to Oscar if he would allow it. I don't think it's necessarily down to me.\n\n\"It's the same, if it's the other way around. Would I be willing to or not? Personally, I think I would just, because I feel like I'm always like that and that's just how I am.\n\n\"I'm not going to ask it, I don't want to ask it because I don't think it's necessarily a fair question,\" he added.\n\n\"At the same time, if that's how it ends and Max wins, then, well, that's it. Congrats to him, and look forward to next year. It doesn't change anything. It doesn't change my life. He will deserve it over us.\"\n\nIt seems unthinkable, though, that McLaren wouldn't ask Piastri to play the perfect team man again \u2014 a role he's played selflessly before in the British outfit \u2014 if it looked as if the team might miss out on the drivers' title after such a dominant year.\n\nPrincipal Andrea Stella, after all, had said after last Sunday's Qatar Grand Prix, where a strategy bungle ruined both their chances, that \"what's important for us is that we are in condition to beat Verstappen with one of our two drivers\".\n\nHe also said then that, though the team's racing approach would not change, there would be conversations this week \u2014 yet both drivers reckoned there had been none so far.\n\nNorris admitted he felt he had most to lose of the three contenders \u2014 and Piastri seemed more relaxed as he explained how he's feeling \"a lot of confidence\" off the back of his superb weekend in Qatar.\n\n\"Obviously, I need a fair few things to happen this weekend to come out champion, but I'll just make sure I'm in the right place at the right time and see what happens,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously, it would be a very cool achievement, but I'm not getting my hopes up too high. We'll see what happens. If I can achieve it, then I'd be a pretty happy guy.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Broken Hill's hard-rock geology could hold part of the solution to Australia's energy storage problem as the country shifts to renewables.\n\nA 200-megawatt, $1 billion facility built by Canadian company Hydrostor near the historic mining city will be Australia's first large-scale compressed air energy storage facility, capable of powering up to 80,000 homes for a day.\n\nThe Silver City Energy Storage Centre will be able to store energy for about eight hours, longer than lithium-ion batteries, which typically hold about four hours of charge in large grid-scale batteries.\n\nThat means solar energy generated during the day can be soaked up and then released through the night.\n\nAbundant daytime renewable energy is wasted because of a lack of storage, and this figure is growing as more renewables come online.\n\nIt is estimated Australia will need up to 20 times more energy storage by 2050, and simply adding more lithium-ion batteries is not the solution because of their high cost and the limit on the number of hours they efficiently store energy.\n\nWhat is compressed air energy storage?\n\nA compressed-air energy storage facility is a bit like a pneumatic nail gun but on a much bigger scale, says Ben Clennell, a research scientist at the CSIRO, who has done work for Hydrostor in the past.\n\nDuring periods of high supply, renewable energy is used to pump atmospheric air, under pressure, into a storage container. It is then released during periods of high demand to drive a turbine and generate electricity.\n\nAn impression of the Hydrostor site. (Supplied: NSW government)\n\n\"It's a bit like storing air in a compressed air cylinder,\" Dr Clennell says.\n\nUnlike a nail gun, the Broken Hill facility has several extra steps to improve efficiency.\n\nThe process of compressing the air generates heat. Your reverse-cycle heater works on the same principle. This surplus heat is stored and then used to heat the stored air when it is decompressed.\n\nThe Broken Hill facility also uses water for a process called \"hydrostatic compensation\".\n\nThe compressed air is stored in a water-filled 280,000 cubic-metre underground cavern, 600 metres below the surface.\n\n\"As the air goes into the underground cavern, it pushes water out of the cavern to a lake at the top,\" Dr Clennell said.\n\nA diagram showing how Hydrostor's Compressed Air Energy Storage System works. (Supplied: Hydrostor)\n\nTo tap this stored energy, the process is reversed \u2014 water is allowed to flow from the surface reservoir back into the underground cavern, pushing air back to the surface where it's reheated and used to spin turbines that generate electricity.\n\nHydrostor, the Canadian company behind the Silver City Energy Storage Centre, said it would use a disused underground mine site adjacent to the proposed cavern to access and excavate rock to create the cavern.\n\n\"It [the rock] will hold water and air without having to line it or build a steel vessel because it's very high-density rock,\" said Martin Becker, from Hydrostor.\n\nDr Clennell said big compressed-air energy storage facilities had to be underground.\n\n\"You can store air in pressure vessels or pipes, or various other arrangements at the surface, but they would rapidly become very large if you're wanting to store hundreds of megawatt hours of electricity-equivalent power,\" he said.\n\nWhy use hydrostatic compensation?\n\nAdding water makes the process more complicated, but more efficient, robust and reliable, according to Seamus Garvey, a professor of energy dynamics at the University of Nottingham.\n\nProfessor Seamus Garvey recently established the Medium Duration Energy Storage Alliance. (Supplied: Seamus Garvey)\n\nIt means that when energy is needed, all of the air pumped into the underground cavern can be released through the turbines. Without water, some of the air would need to be left in the cavern to avoid creating a partial vacuum.\n\n\"You can get all the air back out of the tank when you want to empty it,\" Professor Garvey said.\n\nThe compressor and turbines can work at the same optimal pressure, which makes them more efficient.\n\nWater also mitigates damage to the storage vessels due to stress on materials caused by cycles of pressurisation and depressurisation \u2014 similar to the way the repeated heating and cooling of the ground during the day and night causes rock to warp and then crack.\n\n\"[The materials are in] big tension when the tank is full of high-pressure air, and then they relax a little bit when it's not full of high-pressure air,\" Professor Garvey said.\n\nHow efficient is a compressed air energy storage system?\n\nHydrostor said the Broken Hill facility would have a round-trip efficiency of about 66 per cent.\n\nThis meant about two-thirds of the electricity used to power the air compressors was later recovered as electricity generated by the turbines.\n\nHydrostor said it would take 12 hours to charge the system, which stored energy for eight hours.\n\nCSIRO's Dr Ben Clennell says compressed air energy is ideal for long-term energy storage. (Supplied: CSIRO)\n\nMr Martin said the system was more efficient than traditional compressed air storage because it captured heat and stored it in tanks on the surface.\n\n\"You can't run cool air through these turbines [to generate electricity]. The air needs to be at a certain operating range and temperature,\" he said.\n\n\"In traditional compressed air, when the air is reused to generate, they normally use natural gas. That is very inefficient because you're \u2026 introducing a fossil fuel source.\n\n\"So by capturing that heat, storing it and re-injecting it, you're eliminating the need to introduce another fuel.\"\n\nEven so, Dr Clennell said some energy would be lost as heat.\n\n\"In heat transfer processes, there will be some losses,\" he said.\n\n\"Then as the air expands, there will be some friction, and you generate more heat that wouldn't all be recovered, and so on.\n\n\"So you have losses in the machinery and in the tubing and in the heat exchangers.\"\n\nCompressed air systems were not as efficient as pumped hydro energy storage, said Graham Nathan, research director at the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre (HILT CRC).\n\n\"I mean 66 per cent [efficiency] is pretty good, but it's still pretty lossy. You'd like to be able to get 95 per cent, but of course you never would,\" he said.\n\nWhy compressed air energy storage?\n\nDespite being less efficient than other forms of energy storage, compressed air energy storage has some major advantages.\n\nLarge amounts of air can be stored relatively cheaply, Professor Nathan said.\n\n\"Batteries would be more efficient, but they'd be a much higher cost, and you wouldn't be able to get stuff of that size without being much, much more expensive,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Graham Nathan says compressed air energy storage is a cheap way to store large amounts of energy. (Supplied: HILT CRC)\n\nProfessor Garvey said compressed air could also store energy for longer than lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\"Batteries tend to be excellent solutions for energy storage that will discharge for relatively short periods of time, like up to four hours,\" he said.\n\n\"[But] most of the action that happens with energy storage \u2026 happens in a medium-sized set of time.\"\n\nFour hours of energy storage is useful for delivering stored solar to households in the evening, after the sun has set, but not so helpful for meeting demand through the night and the following morning.\n\nEnergy storage of 4 to 12 hours is known as \"medium duration\".\n\nTechnologies in this area include storing energy as heat in thermal blocks, or as potential energy as weights suspended from cranes, or new kinds of battery technologies currently undergoing testing such as vanadium redox-flow batteries.\n\nProfessor Garvey recently set up a Medium Duration Energy Storage Alliance to help provide recognition that medium duration storage is distinct from short and long duration energy storage.\n\nHow much medium storage energy storage does Australia need?\n\nAustralia needs 10-20 times more energy storage of all kinds by 2050 to meet its net zero emissions target, according to the CSIRO.\n\nBy 2030, about a quarter of energy storage should be medium duration, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator, which also forecasts strong demand.\n\nNew South Wales has legislated a 2-gigawatt target for storage of at least eight hours duration by 2030.\n\nIt is less than halfway towards its target.\n\n\"We do see it as a very important element of energy storage technology in the future,\" Dr Clennell said.",

(ABC News: Shaun Kingma)\n\nThis week, RStar, Tahmoor's majority contractor, has partnered with GBA Capital to assemble a bid.\n\nRStar's legal representative, Olivia Hitchens, principal at Artemide Law, said the consortium was moving quickly to put together an attractive offer.\n\n\"We want everyone who's employed at the mine to continue. That is mission critical for us,\" she said.\n\n\"RStar's workforce is a contracted workforce that would remain, as would the existing workforce \u2026 our proposal also carves off a piece of the pie for management to participate as equity owners.\"\n\nMs Hitchens said the closure had been difficult for RStar workers, many of whom had worked at the mine for decades.\n\n\"I think that the idea came about out of fear that someone else might take over the mine, who might not understand it, might not have the same relationship with management and might not love it the way that our client loves it,\" she said.\n\nCreditors report\n\nThe creditors' report released by William Buck on Monday found LPMA's holding-company structure and the complexity of GFG's global arrangements left its Australian businesses exposed.\n\nIt also revealed a failed $US1 billion plan to shift an electric arc furnace from South Korea to Romania to capture EU steel incentives.\n\nAdministrators said tens of millions were borrowed against Tahmoor to support the project before the economics collapsed when EU incentives were reduced.\n\nCombined with production issues, the cash drain left the mine unable to fund operations, forcing its closure earlier this year.\n\nAdministrators said they had received letters from third parties expressing interest in acquiring Tahmoor Coal and were recommending a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) as a better outcome for creditors than liquidation.\n\nMs Hitchens said the release of the creditors' report provided vital clarity for the consortium as it finalised its bid.\n\n\"Until now, we didn't know what that looks like, but we need to get an idea of that number,\" she said, referring to the scale of LPMA's debt.\n\nShe said analysts were now assessing the mine's assets and future potential following a four-hour underground inspection on Tuesday.\n\nThe mothballed Tahmoor coal mine, which has been closed since February amid financial turmoil at GFG Alliance. (ABC Illawarra: Kelly Fuller )\n\nSite tour\n\nThis week, the RStar consortium conducted that tour with management, which Ms Hitchens described as highly encouraging.\n\n\"They have a really clear plan to re-open the mine, and it was really impressive.\"\n\nShe added that the consortium had been in contact with Mr Gupta and appreciated the access he provided to the mine and his cooperation.\n\nMs Hitchens said the situation remained \"complicated,\" with the administration process, a separate wind-up application from the mine's workers' compensation insurer, and the NSW government's decision to remain a secured creditor all adding uncertainty.\n\n\"There is a lot of hope here, and hopefully governments, unions, investors and powers that be [will] back our consortium and can move quickly, because it is a great asset \u2014 a really solid asset.\"",

    "text": "So, some form of age inference is already being applied to all social media accounts, even when there\u2019s no legal requirement. That might mean inferring your age from photos you post, messages you send or subjects you\u2019re interested in. It\u2019s not exactly precise, but if the estimate on your account is 40-45 then the platform might be satisfied and won\u2019t ask you to verify your age for the purposes of the new laws. If it\u2019s 20-25 though, it may. Loading The eSafety commissioner has recommended companies take a \u201cwaterfall\u201d approach to this problem, borrowing industry jargon to mean starting with the method that interrupts users the least and then escalating from there as necessary. So theoretically, the company could first check to see if it\u2019s already very confident a user is over 16, without the user even knowing. The next option might be an instant background check, which would require the platform to use an identity service. VerifyMy, which supplies services like these to companies complying with US and European laws, says it can verify the vast majority of adults over 18 very quickly using only their email address, deleting all the information afterwards. The social media companies already have your email address, so you would likely be asked to consent to the check, and the identity company would then search through financial records and the like to see if your email address shows up. If you\u2019ve ever taken out a loan or paid for utilities, it probably will. If the methods that can happen automatically in the background fail, the next step would likely involve the user supplying a short video of themselves. Which is where visual facial age estimation comes in.\n\nThe video selfie It\u2019s important to note that since the government isn\u2019t requiring social media companies to use any specific technology or service, we can\u2019t say exactly what the process will be for each app. But in this hypothetical waterfall scenario I\u2019m describing \u2014 based on the eSafety\u2019s guidelines and the way things have worked with age restriction regulations overseas \u2014 I\u2019ll describe the facial age technology provided by Yoti, a British company that Meta uses for identity services. It currently processes more than a million age checks per day, thanks to laws restricting access to adult services and the purchasing of certain goods in the US and Europe. If the platform hasn\u2019t been able to verify that you\u2019re 16 or over with the above methods, it may open up a facial age estimation window powered by Yoti\u2019s technology. This doesn\u2019t require you to download an app or go anywhere outside of the platform, and it works with whatever camera is attached to the device you have. Prompts guide you through capturing a photo of your face, while Yoti\u2019s processes attempt to confirm it is a living face rather than a photo or some other image. Once the data is captured, the system analyses it and guesses your age, with the pass or fail transmitted to the social media platform. Yoti says this takes less than a second. Importantly, it\u2019s not using your facial data to make any assumptions about you other than your age. It\u2019s not trying to identify you, and it doesn\u2019t pass anything on to the social media platform except whether you passed or failed. Yoti says that its selfie age assurance works to within one year of accuracy, and equally well across genders and skin tones. So anyone over 17 should pass.\n\nSo, will kids be able to break into social media using their parents\u2019 faces, as several have already boasted of doing online? Of course they will. Facial age estimation platforms are designed only to guess the age of a face, not to identify the person the face belongs to, or ensure it\u2019s the same person using a social media account. Yoti makes big claims about its ability to tell a living face from a photo or recording, but other platforms may not be as strong. But this isn\u2019t to say that getting around the ban will be easy. The underage user will likely need access to a willing adult accomplice, and all the platform\u2019s other analytics will still be sounding the alarm. If you recently changed your birthdate to make yourself 16 instead of 13, then passed a facial age estimation check, then continued to engage with the platform in a way that\u2019s consistent with a 13-year-old, the apps will take note. You might not get booted right away, but if eSafety is upset that too many underage users are still on the platform, they\u2019ll know who to re-verify. Loading Where else things could come apart At this point in the waterfall hypothetical, the huge majority of Australians who are legitimately over 16 have been allowed onto the platform, either because the app already knows they\u2019re an adult, or because of a background check or facial age estimation. The remainder can fit generally into three groups; those who are under 16, those who are under 17 (remember Yoti\u2019s technology is accurate to within one year), and those who are an absolute edge case in both not having an active email address and appearing significantly younger than they are. Photo IDs are the next least intrusive option.\n\nFor the edge cases, the process should go smoothly and (if the platform is following best practices and eSafety\u2019s guidance) would not require them to give a scan of their ID to a company that\u2019s going to misuse it or store it improperly. An identity service would capture a video of the user holding their ID, checking the details against government records while also matching the face on the document, subsequently informing the platform of a pass or fail and deleting all the data. The big problem for users between 16 and 17 is that if they don\u2019t have a learner\u2019s permit or passport they likely don\u2019t have a useable photo ID. Some states have alternative documents and there are burgeoning digital ID systems that let you prove your age through other documents and then provide a token to the platform, but users will be at the mercy of social media platforms and identity services in terms of which of these are supported. Users who are actually under 16 and are determined to defeat the verification system would likely do so in this step of the waterfall, assuming they couldn\u2019t find a compliant adult to help in the previous one of the waterfall or the previous one. They could procure the genuine photo ID of a person who looks like them, for example their parent or sibling, and hope to get through. Since the verification happens through the identity company and not the social media platform, the ID would not be compared against any photos a user posts. Loading This is all based on speculation of how the system will ideally work, but there are other potential issues. What happens when a small under-resourced or inexperienced social media company tries to comply and ends up with user data it really doesn\u2019t need to have? What about when crooks start making fake pages that look like verification screenings and ask people to send pictures of their passports? What if it\u2019s so easy for underage users to side-step the checks that social media companies need to employ more intrusive methods?",

    "text": "Meta has started locking the accounts of under-16s on Instagram and Facebook ahead of Australia's world-first social media ban, but uncertainty remains over whether young temporary visa holders \u2014 including international students \u2014 will also be swept up in the restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tech giant has confirmed to SBS News Australian under-16s users travelling overseas for a short-term holiday will still be restricted from using Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will still recognise them as a resident of Australia, and they will still be subject to Australian law,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban starts on 10 December , yet Meta has already notified users aged 13 to 15 that their accounts will be shut down. About 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 Instagram accounts are expected to be affected. Under-16s are now blocked from creating new accounts on either platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner told SBS News the rules apply to young people under 16 who are \"ordinarily resident\" in Australia.\n\n\n\nBut what does \"ordinarily resident\" mean in practice \u2014 and could it include young people on temporary visas, such as international students?\n\n\n\nDoes the ban apply to under-16 international students?\n\nA spokesperson for Meta told SBS News it's unlikely teens who enter Australia for a short holiday will have their accounts restricted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, if they stay in Australia for an extended period, such as long study periods, then our age assurance measures will take effect,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Department of Education, 19,768 international students were enrolled in Australian schools and 331,402 in VET programs as of September this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt isn't clear how many of those students are under 16.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could turning off algorithms fix our social media feed? This Australian campaign thinks so\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner said temporary visa holders, including international students, should be aware their accounts \"may be flagged\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could include \"age checks, deactivation or removal if platforms receive signals indicating they are in Australia for a significant period of time or indefinitely\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has sought clarification from the eSafety commissioner on what counts as a \"significant period of time\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Citizenship Act (2007) a person is not \"ordinarily resident\" in Australia if they reside in the country for a \"special or temporary purpose only\", but considered resident if they are home or have a permanent abode in the country.\n\n\n\nNot just location data\n\nIt's understood platforms won't rely solely on location data to determine whether a young person is living in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn eSafety spokesperson said the industry will use \"various signals\" to identify a person's country of residence.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner told SBS News they understand Meta will use \"various signals\" to detect users' locations. Source: AAP / Nicholas T. Ansell \"This approach will also be leveraged to prevent issues such as circumvention via VPN as well [as] limit unintended disruption of services to people visiting the country for a short period,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not clear what those signals might be, but the spokesperson said platforms are expected to take reasonable steps to address potential errors, such as mistakenly including a young person .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Platforms should also provide clear ways for people to request a review if they have been age-restricted by mistake,\" they said.\n\n\n\nNearly 'every teen affected'\n\nRoy Morgan research released this week shows 624,000 Australians aged 14 and 15 use at least one social media platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube was the most popular platform, with 95 per cent of young Australians using it.\n\n\n\nSnapchat was next at 87 per cent, followed by Facebook and then Instagram at 81 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Morgan CEO Michele Levine said the number shows how \"deeply social media is embedded in the daily lives of Australian teenagers\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The new legislation to ban social media for Australians under 16, set to be enforced from next week, will affect almost every 14 to 15-year-old in the country.\"\n\n\n\n",

So, if you look at some of the geological studies done, Denmark has the potential to actually store more than several hundred years of our own emissions. So, we are able to create an industry where we can support Europe in actually storing a lot of the CO2 here. So, plenty of potential to do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri is close to the remote Nini oil field.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project - used to extract fossil fuels from beneath the seabed - will give the field a second lease of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a process that almost reverses oil extraction, INEOS plans to inject liquefied carbon dioxide deep down into depleted oil reservoirs, 1,800 meters beneath the North Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe carbon capture and storage efforts are named Greensand Future.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Bjerre is the maintenance manager at INEOS Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With this new green transition, we're actually going to do the same thing, but instead of taking oil out of the reservoir, we're actually reversing the flow and adding the CO2 to the reservoir, instead giving us a future out here and also a big contribution to the green transition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreensand is expected to become the European Union\u2019s first fully-operational offshore carbon dioxide storage site.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the aim when the project begins its commercial operations next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will initially begin storing close to 400,000 tonnes [[363,000 metric tonnes]] of carbon dioxide each year, scaling up to as much as 8 million tonnes [[7.2 million metric tonnes]] annually by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Gade says it's the best solution to reduce emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think it's one of the best answers to cut emissions. And the reason is that we don't want to deindustrialise Europe. We want to have actually a few instruments to decarbonise instead. So we can maintain our industry, but meanwhile actually remove some of the CO2, so it's going to offset.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreensand has struck deals with Danish biogas facilities to bury their captured carbon emissions into depleted reservoirs of the Nini oil field.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU has proposed developing around 280 million tonnes of carbon dioxide storage per year by 2040.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a part of their plans to reach \"net zero\" emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nNiels Schovsbo is a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says experts at Denmark\u2019s geological survey say Greensand reservoir sandstone rock is well-suited.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that a third of the rock volume is made up of tiny cavities, perfect for storing the liquified carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe found that there is no reactions between the reservoir and the injected CO2. And we find that the seal rock on top of that has sufficient capacity to withhold the pressure that is induced when we are storing CO2 in the subsurface. So, these two methods make it a perfect site for storage right there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while there are many carbon capture facilities around the world, the technology is far from scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sometimes uses fossil fuel energy in its operations, and captures just a tiny fraction of worldwide emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, the Greensand project\u2019s aim is to bury up to eight million tons of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust last year, nearly 38 billion tons of carbon dioxide was emitted globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chemical giant is also hoping to begin development at another previously unopened North Sea oil field.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelene Hagel is the head of climate and environment policy at Greenpeace Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We could have CCS on those very few sectors where emissions are truly difficult or impossible to abate, but when you have all sectors in society almost saying, we need to just catch the emissions and store them instead of reducing emissions, and that is the problem in developed societies right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says carbon capture storage has been used as an excuse by industries to delay cutting emissions.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australia's latest sanctions on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" are symbolic and still fall short of measures imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom, an expert says, despite praise from Ukraine's ambassador.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $95 million aid package brings Australia's total support of Ukraine to $1.7 billion since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Defence Minister Richard Marles and Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a joint statement on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ministers also announced targeted sanctions on an additional 45 Russian \"shadow fleet\" vessels \u2014 tankers used to carry Russian crude oil to countries such as India and China, where it is refined and sold on to markets including Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe addition of 45 new vessels brings the total number of sanctioned shadow fleet ships to 200, according to Thursday's joint statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SBS investigation in October revealed that , at that time, at least 25 of these vessels remained in the supply chains of Australian companies.\n\n\n\nCall for more action on indirect oil imports\n\nWong said the latest sanctions were \"part of a coordinated effort to starve Russia's oil revenues and limit its ability to finance its invasion\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Anton Moiseienko, a senior law lecturer at the Australian National University, told SBS News the sanctions would not meaningfully restrict Russia's oil revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Wong highlighted that \"direct Australian imports of Russian energy products have fallen from $80 million before Russia's invasion to zero\", Moiseienko said direct imports were only one part of a much bigger picture.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'Shadow fleet' still appearing in Australian supply chains despite sanctions, research finds SBS News 03:49 English\n\nUnlike the EU and UK, Australia has not banned indirect purchases, and until similar restrictions were adopted, Moiseienko said its actions would remain \"largely symbolic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is in a very uncomfortable position of being one of the major holdouts in relation to [imposing] those sanctions,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine's ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, said that, while the additional shadow fleet sanctions were welcome, more needed to be done \u2014 including restrictions on companies or countries that still enable Russia to sell its oil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we can limit the ability of Russia to make money out of [oil and gas], we will be able to starve their economy and deprive them an opportunity to produce more weapons to kill Ukrainians,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nGreens defence spokesperson David Shoebridge called on the federal government to implement further sanctions on Russian oil imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia needs to make it clear, no oil that is sourced in Russia, whether it's washed through a refinery in India or not, can be sold into Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\nUkraine ambassador praises 'true act of mateship'\n\nIn Thursday's joint statement, Marles said Australia was \"unwavering in its support for Ukraine\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These commitments will make a tangible difference in Ukraine's defence against Russia's illegal and immoral invasion,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose comments were echoed by Myroshnychenko, who said the federal government's package was a \"tangible contribution\" to his nation's war effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe thanked Marles and Wong, telling SBS News the latest package was a \"true act of mateship\".\n\n\n\n\"Australia remains the largest ... military contributor ... outside of NATO, for which we are grateful,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said funds from the package would be used to procure ammunition and missiles from the United States, which would save Ukrainian lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the $95 million announced on Thursday, $50 million will go towards the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) initiative to supply Ukraine with critical military equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Defence Force supplies and weapons worth $43 million will also be donated, including tactical air defence radars, munitions and combat engineering equipment.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The challengers to Australia's sanctions against Russia\n\nAn extra $2 million will be provided to help Ukraine with advanced drone technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has also imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on more than 1,180 people and 293 entities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition welcomed the latest support package but said it was \"long overdue\" and a \"drop in the ocean\" compared to Australia's $56 billion defence budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said military support for Ukraine was about supporting the \"brave Ukrainian people\" to stand up against \"unacceptable Russian brutality and aggression\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The end of this war can't come soon enough, but it needs to be a lasting peace that does justice to the courage that the Ukrainians have shown,\" he told ABC RN on Thursday morning.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE US and Russia fail to reach compromise on Ukraine following talks at the Kremlin\n\nThe announcement comes during another round of peace talks aimed at ending the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the path ahead for Ukraine peace talks is unclear, US president Donald Trump said on Wednesday, after what he previously described as \"reasonably good\" talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US envoys.\n\n\n\n\n\nA meeting between the White House and Ukrainian officials is scheduled for Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The cost of a comfortable retirement is higher than it's ever been, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peak body's CEO, Mary Delahunty, said, fortunately, the average balance of superannuation accounts has also risen to a record high.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average balance is sitting at $172,834 for nearly 18 million superannuation account holders over the age of 15. For those aged 65 to 69, the average balance is around $420,934.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More Australians than ever before are reaching retirement with meaningful super behind them,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it might not feel that way to many Australians.\n\n\n\nWith the eye-watering cost of living putting pressure on families and economic uncertainty overseas making Australians anxious , two new guides have outlined how much you need to support your retirement.\n\n\n\nSo how much will you need?\n\nThere are many factors that influence how much money you'll need, such as age pension eligibility, whether you own your home, and your living situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost calculations consider a more modest budget option versus a more comfortable lifestyle, including things like overseas travel and subscriptions to streaming services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to ASFA, coupled homeowners 65 and over will need $76,505 each year to live comfortably in retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nA single person will need around $54,240 each year.\n\n\n\nAccording to ASFA, coupled homeowners 65 and over will need $76,505 each year to live comfortably in retirement, while a single person will need around $54,240 each year. Source: SBS News That's an increase of 3.5 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively compared to this time last year, and it's directly connected to the rising cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group estimated retirees over 85 who own their home would need less money, offering about $71,104 as a guide for a couple and $47,534 for a single person.\n\n\n\n\n\nA separate estimate from Super Consumers Australia, a group that advocates for lower- and middle-income super consumers, suggests that a typical single homeowner will need around $322,000 in superannuation for a comfortable retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCouples will need a combined $432,000.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In contrast, for those living a 'modest lifestyle', the estimated annual budget was approximately $20,000 lower, as they typically spend less on health insurance, cars, and take fewer holidays, among other expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say it may take even less in superannuation to have a secure retirement, especially if you own your own home.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Moloney, the deputy director of the housing and economic security program at the Grattan Institute, previously told SBS News the real cost of retirement could be even lower, as retirees typically spend less once they stop working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you look at people's spending habits from pre-retirement to post-retirement, what you see is that people spend less in retirement and increasingly so as retirement goes on,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pensioners benefit from a bunch of discounts on council rates, electricity, medicines and other benefits that add up to an implicit income of thousands of dollars a year.\"\n\n\n\nWhere have prices risen most?\n\nWith the consumer price index rising in the September quarter to 1.3 per cent , and a 3.2 per cent increase over the past year, more people are spending money on daily essentials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the September quarter alone, electricity prices have risen by 9 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past twelve months, the increase is closer to 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of eating out has risen by around 1.3 per cent, while those staying in are paying 9.3 per cent more for media services.\n\n\n\nDelahunty said the holidays will be a challenging time for many retirees because prices have risen fastest in the things they spend most on, like \"food, energy and health\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some older people may cut back on pricier gifts, travel and social occasions to stay on top of the basics,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe pointed to recent reforms, including the move to 12 per cent super and Payday Super , that could give people more security over their retirement savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenge now is to keep strengthening the system so every Australian has the best possible chance of a comfortable, dignified retirement, not just at Christmas but all year round.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

    "text": "So, some form of age inference is already being applied to all social media accounts, even when there\u2019s no legal requirement. That might mean inferring your age from photos you post, messages you send or subjects you\u2019re interested in. It\u2019s not exactly precise, but if the estimate on your account is 40-45 then the platform might be satisfied and won\u2019t ask you to verify your age for the purposes of the new laws. If it\u2019s 20-25 though, it may. Loading The eSafety commissioner has recommended companies take a \u201cwaterfall\u201d approach to this problem, borrowing industry jargon to mean starting with the method that interrupts users the least and then escalating from there as necessary. So theoretically, the company could first check to see if it\u2019s already very confident a user is over 16, without the user even knowing. The next option might be an instant background check, which would require the platform to use an identity service. VerifyMy, which supplies services like these to companies complying with US and European laws, says it can verify the vast majority of adults over 18 very quickly using only their email address, deleting all the information afterwards. The social media companies already have your email address, so you would likely be asked to consent to the check, and the identity company would then search through financial records and the like to see if your email address shows up. If you\u2019ve ever taken out a loan or paid for utilities, it probably will. If the methods that can happen automatically in the background fail, the next step would likely involve the user supplying a short video of themselves. Which is where visual facial age estimation comes in.\n\nThe video selfie It\u2019s important to note that since the government isn\u2019t requiring social media companies to use any specific technology or service, we can\u2019t say exactly what the process will be for each app. But in this hypothetical waterfall scenario I\u2019m describing \u2014 based on the eSafety\u2019s guidelines and the way things have worked with age restriction regulations overseas \u2014 I\u2019ll describe the facial age technology provided by Yoti, a British company that Meta uses for identity services. It currently processes more than a million age checks per day, thanks to laws restricting access to adult services and the purchasing of certain goods in the US and Europe. If the platform hasn\u2019t been able to verify that you\u2019re 16 or over with the above methods, it may open up a facial age estimation window powered by Yoti\u2019s technology. This doesn\u2019t require you to download an app or go anywhere outside of the platform, and it works with whatever camera is attached to the device you have. Prompts guide you through capturing a photo of your face, while Yoti\u2019s processes attempt to confirm it is a living face rather than a photo or some other image. Once the data is captured, the system analyses it and guesses your age, with the pass or fail transmitted to the social media platform. Yoti says this takes less than a second. Importantly, it\u2019s not using your facial data to make any assumptions about you other than your age. It\u2019s not trying to identify you, and it doesn\u2019t pass anything on to the social media platform except whether you passed or failed. Yoti says that its selfie age assurance works to within one year of accuracy, and equally well across genders and skin tones. So anyone over 17 should pass.\n\nSo, will kids be able to break into social media using their parents\u2019 faces, as several have already boasted of doing online? Of course they will. Facial age estimation platforms are designed only to guess the age of a face, not to identify the person the face belongs to, or ensure it\u2019s the same person using a social media account. Yoti makes big claims about its ability to tell a living face from a photo or recording, but other platforms may not be as strong. But this isn\u2019t to say that getting around the ban will be easy. The underage user will likely need access to a willing adult accomplice, and all the platform\u2019s other analytics will still be sounding the alarm. If you recently changed your birthdate to make yourself 16 instead of 13, then passed a facial age estimation check, then continued to engage with the platform in a way that\u2019s consistent with a 13-year-old, the apps will take note. You might not get booted right away, but if eSafety is upset that too many underage users are still on the platform, they\u2019ll know who to re-verify. Loading Where else things could come apart At this point in the waterfall hypothetical, the huge majority of Australians who are legitimately over 16 have been allowed onto the platform, either because the app already knows they\u2019re an adult, or because of a background check or facial age estimation. The remainder can fit generally into three groups; those who are under 16, those who are under 17 (remember Yoti\u2019s technology is accurate to within one year), and those who are an absolute edge case in both not having an active email address and appearing significantly younger than they are. Photo IDs are the next least intrusive option.\n\nFor the edge cases, the process should go smoothly and (if the platform is following best practices and eSafety\u2019s guidance) would not require them to give a scan of their ID to a company that\u2019s going to misuse it or store it improperly. An identity service would capture a video of the user holding their ID, checking the details against government records while also matching the face on the document, subsequently informing the platform of a pass or fail and deleting all the data. The big problem for users between 16 and 17 is that if they don\u2019t have a learner\u2019s permit or passport they likely don\u2019t have a useable photo ID. Some states have alternative documents and there are burgeoning digital ID systems that let you prove your age through other documents and then provide a token to the platform, but users will be at the mercy of social media platforms and identity services in terms of which of these are supported. Users who are actually under 16 and are determined to defeat the verification system would likely do so in this step of the waterfall, assuming they couldn\u2019t find a compliant adult to help in the previous one of the waterfall or the previous one. They could procure the genuine photo ID of a person who looks like them, for example their parent or sibling, and hope to get through. Since the verification happens through the identity company and not the social media platform, the ID would not be compared against any photos a user posts. Loading This is all based on speculation of how the system will ideally work, but there are other potential issues. What happens when a small under-resourced or inexperienced social media company tries to comply and ends up with user data it really doesn\u2019t need to have? What about when crooks start making fake pages that look like verification screenings and ask people to send pictures of their passports? What if it\u2019s so easy for underage users to side-step the checks that social media companies need to employ more intrusive methods?",

We want our kids and grandkids to be able to enjoy fishing in our beautiful state into the future,\" Cook said.\n\n\"We know that these reforms will have a large impact on the fishing industry and sectors, and we have been working with them closely throughout this decision-making process...
