(9News)\n\nIt's a big shift in sentiment from hopes last month's cut would kick off consecutive cash rate reductions through this year.\ufeff\n\nFinder head of consumer research Graham Cooks said it looked like mortgage holders will have to hold out until May for the next cut.\n\n\"The February cut signalled a turning point for many cash-strapped borrowers \u2013 they hoped a couple more would be coming thick and fast,\" he said.\n\n\"New inflation figures show headline inflation is within target range, so while we're unlikely to see a second rate cut in April, we're anticipating further relief from May onwards.\" \ufeff\n\nDespite a thumping belief the RBA will keep interest rates on hold, six of the 34 experts believe there is a case for slashing them.\n\nOne of them was Leanne Pilkington from Laing+Simmons who thinks a cut next month would be shrewd in light of recent jobs numbers.\ufeff\n\nLast week's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained flat at 4.1 per cent.\n\n\"As well as sustained cost of living pressure and moderating inflation, the unexpected hit to employment figures has widened the window of opportunity for the RBA to cut rates, which it is expected to do in coming months anyway. It might be prudent to act now,\" Pilkington said.\n\nThe survey was carried out before today's announcement by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese an election would be held on May 3, a factor alluded to by one expert.\n\nAustralia's fastest-selling homes: top suburbs revealed View Gallery\n\n\"Another rate cut coming soon but not just yet\u2014it's not urgent, and the bank will want to keep a low profile during the election campaign,\" said Geoffrey Kingston, of the Macquarie University Business School in Sydney.\n\nLooking ahead, two in three experts surveyed forecast two or three more cuts this year.\n\nA thumping 93 per cent also thought lenders would continue to pass on the next cut to the cash rate in full.\ufeff",

    "text": "Chelsea Bagnall has lived with excruciating pain for almost as long as she can remember.\n\nAs a child, she was sick on and off with urinary infections, bouts of vomiting and bowel issues.\n\nFour years ago, when she was 15 years old, Chelsea's health took a sudden and scary nose dive.\n\nThe bouts of vomiting became a daily occurrence and she began experiencing fainting spells. Chelsea's weight plummeted to 40 kilograms, while her body mass index (BMI) was sitting at just 13.\n\nChelsea spent weeks at a time in an eating disorder clinic, where she was force-fed. (Supplied: Emma Bagnall)\n\nInstead of receiving answers, Chelsea was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder and placed in an inpatient program where she was force-fed for a year.\n\nNow, after years of suffering, Chelsea, 19, finally has the correct diagnosis: Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS) and Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS), two rare conditions that compress major arteries and make eating unbearably painful.\n\nIn 2021, doctors were so concerned about her weight that Chelsea was admitted to a NSW hospital.\n\nThere, she was immediately fitted with a nasal feeding tube in an attempt to stabilise her weight.\n\n\"I was in there for a couple of days before a psychiatrist came to talk to me, but I realised quite quickly that I wasn't in a normal hospital room,\" Chelsea said.\n\n\"I was put in a room with three other girls who all had tubes in their faces as well. I didn't quite understand at the time that I was already being stereotyped into something that I wasn't even aware of.\"\n\nWhen she was seen by a psychologist, Chelsea said she was asked leading questions about her eating habits.\n\n\"She was asking me questions, like, 'What do you think of your body image? Have you ever made yourself vomit? Do you starve yourself?'\" Chelsea said.\n\n\"Obviously, I answered with, 'No, I've never starved myself, I've never made myself vomit. I've never wanted to be thin'.\n\n\"I quite clearly said to her, 'I want to put on weight. I want to be healthy'.\"\n\nDespite Chelsea's insistence that she did not have an eating disorder, doctors diagnosed her with avoidant, restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and placed her in an eating disorder program, where she would spend months at a time.\n\nHer mother, Emma Bagnall, told 9news.com.au she felt also pressured to believe in the diagnosis.\n\n\"They pulled me aside and had separate conversations with me. They told me, 'She's going to do anything she can to get out of this. She's going make excuses. She's gonna fight to not be here',\" Emma said.\n\n\"There were tears, and she was begging me to take her home, and I'd have to calm her down.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Peter Dutton quizzed on Coalition tax policy after budget handed down\n\nChelsea Bagnall, pictured with her mother Emma. (Supplied: Emma Bagnall)\n\nAs part of the program, Chelsea was weighed every morning and put in a room to eat her food in front of hospital staff with a timer.\n\n\"If we didn't finish in time the food was thrown out,\" Chelsea said.\n\n\"I was in there, and I realised these girls didn't have the same issues with eating as me, they weren't in excruciating pain.\n\n\"They were reluctant, and refusing at first, but eventually they gave in, because they realised they don't have a choice. I was trying to eat, but I couldn't keep up. Before I knew it, the alarm would go off and my food was snatched away from me.\"\n\nWhen she did not finish her food in time, Chelsea said she was given a liquid supplement to drink, which she would often immediately vomit up.\n\nWhile other patients in the eating disorder program would recover and go home, Chelsea would be in the hospital for long periods of time, attending school there.\n\nEmma said the treatment her daughter received was \"inhumane\" but just as worrying was the lack of other tests done to get to the bottom of her illness.\n\n\"They should have had her seen by a rheumatologist, endocrinologist, and gastroenterologist. They didn't,\" Emma said.\n\n\"No doctors did any tests, no one consulted her about anything else. There was no further investigation.\"\n\nChelsea was in and out of hospital for four years before she finally received a diagnosis. (Supplied: Emma Bagnall)\n\nThings did not change for Chelsea until the family moved to Canberra, where confused doctors confirmed she showed no sign of having an eating disorder and began running gastrointestinal tests.\n\nHowever, the breakthrough really came last Christmas during a visit to a GP, who had stepped in when Chelsea's regular doctor was away.\n\nThe GP, Emma said, pulled a stethoscope out and listened to Chelsea's stomach, before commenting that he could not hear any movement.\n\nHe ordered a CT angiogram, and while the mother and daughter were initially sceptical, it proved to be the missing link to the puzzle.\n\nThe scan showed a compression on Chelsea's left renal vein, leading to the diagnosis of Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS).\n\nAn ultrasound later showed compressions on Chelsea's celiac artery as well, a sign pointing to Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS).\n\nFurther testing has shown three areas needing surgery and Chelsea is set to finally get the help she needs with an operation in May.\n\nCanberra vascular surgeon Gert Frahm-Jensen said vascular compression syndromes, such as MALS and SMAS, were a controversial subject.\n\n\"They are considered very rare, although the reality is that they're probably more common than we think,\" Frahm-Jensen, an Associate Professor at the Australian National University's School of Medicine and Psychology, said.\n\n\"What makes it extra tricky is that sometimes patients have scans that show vascular compression but no symptoms, other times they have relatively mild compression but significant symptoms.\"\n\nWhile roughly one fifth of the population had some sort of compression of their celiac artery consistent with MALS, most of these people were not affected by chronic abdominal pain or trouble eating, Frahm-Jensen said.\n\nAdding to the difficulty with diagnosing MALS was the fact that there were many causes of stomach pain which were far more common, including gallbladder or pancreas problems or inflammatory bowel disorders.\n\n\"It becomes in many cases a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning you've ruled out everything else,\" Frahm-Jensen said.\n\nDespite scepticism from some doctors about whether MALS and SMAS were real conditions, about 70 per cent of people who underwent surgery for MALS and SMAS showed an improvement in symptoms afterwards, he said.\n\nChelsea said she hoped surgery would give her a chance to live a normal life, but the experience of being left to suffer in pain for years by the medical profession had left her scarred.\n\nTo those struggling with undiagnosed health problems, Chelsea has a message: \"You know your body. You know if something's wrong. Don't stop advocating for yourself, no matter how hard it gets, no matter how much you're dismissed, no matter how much you're gaslit into believing that you're fine.",

    "text": "When single mum Nicole Mahoney's twin baby boys arrived 12 weeks early, all her carefully laid maternity leave plans were thrown into disarray.\n\nThe twins, Angus and Hugh, were both born weighing just 1.1 kilograms and were not much bigger than a 500ml bottle of chocolate milk.\n\nThey needed to spend months in a neonatal intensive care unit after their birth in March 2020, with one staying three months in hospital and the other five months.\n\nIt was an incredibly stressful time, Mahoney told 9news.com.au, with large amounts of her days taken up with just waiting at the hospital to hold her babies.\n\nTwins Angus and Hugh were born 12 weeks early and weighed just 1.1kg. (Supplied: Nicole Mahoney)\n\n\"You were only allowed to hold them once a day, and at times they were too sick, so you couldn't even hold them at all,\" she said.\n\nMahoney, who now lives in Adelaide, was working as a government employee in NSW at the time and had planned to take 12 months maternity leave.\n\nHowever, half of that time was taken up in hospital, Mahoney said, adding that she quickly realised how rigid the federal government's paid parental leave scheme was.\n\n\"From the day that the boys were born, I had to use maternity leave. It had to start then,\" she said.\n\n\"I had 12 weeks of sick leave I accrued, but I couldn't touch that.\n\n\"The frustrating thing is that if they had been born then gone to hospital at day 1 for this amount of time I would have been able to use my sick leave to care for them and be with them, so why not in this circumstance?\"\n\nMahoney said she spent much of the second half of her maternity leave taking the twins to medical appointments and protecting them from getting sick with their fragile immune systems.\n\n\"Even once you were out, you were just forever still at the hospital,\" Mahoney said.\n\n\"They were also really susceptible to catching things.\n\n\"For childcare, they told me don't put them in until they're at least one. Just don't do it, because you're just risking re-hospitalisation.\"\n\nMahoney is one parent joining a campaign from premature babies advocacy group Miracle Babies Foundation, calling on the Albanese government and Opposition to commit to changing the Paid Parental Leave legislation to include extra allowances for parents of premature babies.\n\nTimed to coincide with the lead-up to the federal election, the foundation's campaign is asking for primary carers of premature babies needing specialist care to be given an extra week of extra Parental Leave Pay for every week a baby is in the hospital beyond two weeks, with a maximum of 14 weeks extra pay. For fathers and partners, the foundation is asking for additional two weeks of extra Dad and Partner Pay.\n\nUnder the current legislation, eligible parents receive up to 20 weeks' paid parental leave at the national minimum wage. Working dads and partners receive two weeks' leave paid at the national minimum wage. The scheme will be expanded to 26 weeks by 2026, with four weeks reserved for each parent.\n\nNicole Mahoney's twin boys are now five years old. (Supplied: Nicole Mahoney)\n\nThe campaign follows a parliamentary petition on the same topic lodged by the Miracle Babies Foundation in 2023, which received more than 10,000 signatures.\n\nFollowing the petition, the Australian Public Service Commission enterprise agreement was updated to include additional leave for parents of premature babies, but this only applies to government employees.\n\nMiracle Babies Foundation co-founder and CEO Kylie Pussell said the current conditions of the parental leave scheme meant some parents of premature babies were coming home from hospital with no leave left.\n\n\"We believe that all babies should be going home from hospital with that same amount of parental leave,\" she said.\n\nPussell said parents and carers of premature babies were already under huge financial strain, with many having paid for months of travel costs to and from the hospital, as well as eating out and accommodation expenses.\n\n\"It's such a difficult time, and then when you get to baby's discharge and you've got no pay parental leave left, we're putting women in such a difficult position of perhaps having to leave the workforce because they have nothing left,\" she said.\n\nPussell said the lack of extra support for parents of premature babies also meant some could be forced to put vulnerable babies into childcare before they were ready.\n\n\"It's putting parents in a really difficult spot,\" she said.\n\nSocial Services minister Amanda Rishworth said she understood the unique challenges faced by families who had experienced the birth of a premature or sick newborn.\n\n\"Over the past three years, the Albanese Labor Government has delivered the biggest expansion to Paid Parental Leave since Labor first introduced the scheme in 2011,\" Rishworth said.\n\n\"Our changes are providing families, including those with a premature or sick baby, with the support they need to manage care of their child in the way that best suits their circumstances.\n\n\"This includes arrangements to enable parents to take time off work together for longer and to provide the additional flexibility that helps families who have a child in hospital.\"\n\nMahoney, whose twin sons are now aged five, said she hoped the government would reconsider their stance and increase the support for parents of premature babies.\n\n\"You'd be providing parents with the opportunity to actually spend that time with their kids that everyone else gets. It's being taken away from them,\" she said.\n\n\"These kids are very vulnerable, so being forced to send them back into childcare early, when they're still very susceptible to getting sick and having serious sicknesses as a result of it, it just puts them at risk.\n\n\"It's stressful to the families, and it also means that women will probably stay out of the workforce longer because you don't feel safe to put your kid into childcare when they've been that sick.\"",

    "text": "Labor and the Coalition have promised billions of dollars across the board to convince Australians to vote for them on May 3 \u2014 and it can be hard to keep track.\n\nThere's a laundry list of commitments Labor and the Coalition have already made, though you can expect more to come through the campaign, which will be added to this piece as they are announced.\n\nElection commitments aren't a complete picture of how the major parties intend to govern \u2014 their governing style, relations with foreign powers and reactions to domestic and global events are all essential parts of running the country that can't easily be captured by a list of promises.\n\nIt also doesn't account for compromises that may have to be made if neither party can form a majority, and must negotiate with other parties or independent MPs to win government.\n\nHere is a round-up of some of the more significant promises made by the major parties to be carried out next term.\n\nHealth\n\nLabor\n\nOne of Labor's major policy commitments is to tip $8.5 billion more into Medicare in an effort to have nine out of 10 GP visits bulk-billed by the end of the decade. The money would be spent to triple incentives to doctors not to charge any out-of-pocket costs to patients.\n\nIt would also go towards training 2,000 new GP trainees a year, and additional nurses.\n\nIn a $644 million promise, Labor will also expand the urgent care clinic network by opening 50 new centres by mid-2026, the bulk of which will be in NSW, Victoria and Queensland.\n\nLabor will also commit $573 million to women's health, including a boost to Medicare rebates for long-acting contraceptives such as IUDs.\n\nA new Medicare rebate would also be created for menopause health assessments as well as funding to train health professionals on the topic.\n\nThe government will also expand the network of endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics operating around the country from 22 to 33.\n\nAnd it will slash the price of PBS-listed medicines from $31.60 to $25, at a cost to the budget of $690 million.\n\nIn total the party has committed more than $9 billion in health spending.\n\nCoalition\n\nSeeking to head off a scare campaign over Medicare, the Coalition has promised to match Labor's $8.5 billion bulk billing promise \"dollar-for-dollar\".\n\nThe Coalition will also match Labor's promised $573 million boost to women's healthcare, and the $690 million promise to slash the price of PBS-listed medicines to $25.\n\nSeparately, the Coalition will commit $400 million towards financial incentives and leave entitlements for junior doctors who enter general practice, to bridge the gap that the Coalition says dis-incentivises junior doctors to enter GP clinics in favour of the hospital system.\n\nAnd a $5 million review of women's healthcare items will also be commissioned to identify gaps in services and subsidised medications for women.\n\nIn total, the party has committed more than $10.1 billion in health spending.\n\nCost of Living\n\nLabor\n\nWith impacts of more than two years of high inflation still being felt, both major parties are offering a suite of measures to directly relieve cost-of-living pressures, which have been collated here.\n\nLabor has promised to once again offer a rebate on household and small business power bills of $150, which will be automatically applied from July this year and paid over two instalments.\n\nIt will also deliver a small tax cut over two stages \u2014 the first on July 1 next year and the second on July 1, 2027. That will save every taxpayer about $5 a week in year one and $10 a week from year two onwards.\n\nThe cost of PBS-listed medicines will be reduced from $31.60 to $25, and remain at $7.70 for concession card holders.\n\nLabor has also promised to slash students' debts by 20 per cent in a one-off move , which it expects to wipe about $5,520 from the average HELP debt.\n\nIn total, those measures will cost the government more than $20 billion over the forward estimates, with the majority of that being the cost of tax cuts.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition's major cost-of-living offering is a 25 cent reduction on the cost of a litre of fuel, by temporarily halving the fuel excise for 12 months.\n\nIf that discount is fully passed on by wholesalers, the Coalition estimates it will save the average person about $14 on their weekly refuel.\n\nThe Coalition has said it won't stand in the way of Labor's $150 rebate on power bills to be applied from July over two instalments.\n\nSimilarly, it will match the promise to reduce the price of PBS medicines from $31.60 to $25.\n\nAnd it will offer small businesses tax deductions up to $20,000 for business-related meal expenses.\n\nAll told, those measures will cost about $8.75 billion over the forward estimates, with the bulk of that expense being the temporary halving of the fuel tax.\n\nHousing\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will match the Coalition's promise to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from purchasing existing homes for two years.\n\nThe party will also expand its Help-to-Buy scheme, which was legislated late last year. Under the scheme, the federal government covers part of the cost of a home for eligible first home buyers, and takes an equity stake that can be bought out at a later date.\n\nLabor will expand eligibility to single people earning less than $100,000 and couples earning less than $160,000, as well as raise the maximum price of properties eligible under the scheme.\n\nThe party will continue the rollout of money from its Housing Australia Future Fund, which is designed to support the construction of 55,000 social and affordable homes over the next five years.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition would establish a $5 billion fund to speed up essential infrastructure like water, power and sewage at housing development sites, which the party says will \"unlock\" up to 500,000 new homes.\n\nIt would also place a 10-year freeze on changes to the National Construction Code, which sets minimum safety and accessibility standards for buildings, to ease supply constraints and give investors more certainty.\n\nThe Coalition has also promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from purchasing existing homes for two years.\n\nAnd it would allow first homebuyers to access up to $50,000 from their superannuation to purchase a home \u2014 which would have to be returned if the home is later sold.\n\nIt has also promised to scrap Labor's $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, saying not a single home has yet been completed under the scheme.\n\nClimate and energy\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will extend rebates on electricity bills by another six months, meaning households will receive a $150 rebate on their power bills from July, paid over two instalments.\n\nThe party is yet to announce new climate change commitments, but will continue to pursue its stated ambition of having 82 per cent of the electricity market powered by renewables by the end of the decade, and have emissions 43 per cent lower than 2005 levels by the decade's end.\n\nCoalition\n\nOne of the Coalition's boldest commitments is to establish a nuclear power industry by building seven nuclear power plants in regional Australia.\n\nThe Coalition says under its plan the first reactor would be operational from 2035 or 2037 \u2014 depending on what technology is used.\n\nModelling commissioned by the Coalition suggested that plan would cost $331 billion to 2050, though the figure is disputed since that modelling assumed a smaller economy and smaller energy demands.\n\nThe life of ageing coal plants would be extended to cover the gap in the meantime.\n\nAssisting to cover the gap would be a significant expansion to gas infrastructure through a $1 billion fund, and a requirement for the gas giants to reserve up to 20 per cent of uncontracted gas for the domestic market.\n\nThe Coalition expects that would lower the price of wholesale gas from $14 to less than $10 by the end of this year.\n\nAs part of its energy policy, the Coalition would also fast-track the approval of Woodside's North West Shelf gas expansion, signing off within 30 days of taking office.\n\nAnd it would end Labor's $20 billion Rewiring the Nation Fund, which has been investing in transmission technology to get the grid ready for more renewables.\n\nThe Coalition has also promised to defund the Environmental Defenders Office, which has become a political football, having its funding cut under former PM Tony Abbott and then restored under the Albanese government.\n\nThe Coalition has said it won't stand in the way of Labor's $150 power bill rebate promise.\n\nChildcare\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has promised to establish a $1 billion fund to build and expand around 160 childcare centres over four years. It says where possible those centres would be located on or near school sites, and the government would retain ownership of those services.\n\nThe government brought forward its promise to scrap the childcare activity test in favour of a guarantee that every family would receive at least three days of subsidised care each week, meaning this promise has already become law.\n\nIt means from 2026 parents will not need to satisfy requirements to work, study or volunteer to receive the Child Care Subsidy.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition says it will ensure families have access to affordable and flexible quality early childhood education. The Coalition says it will announce its childcare policies closer to the election.\n\nMigration\n\nLabor\n\nLabor says it will announce its migration policies closer to the election, which will be in line with its stated goal of bringing migration \"under control\" and maintaining Australia's borders.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition says it wants to \"rebalance\" Australia's migration program.\n\nIf elected, the Coalition would reduce the annual intake of permanent migrants from 185,000 to 140,000 for two years (as well as a reduced intake of 150,000 in year three and 160,000 in year four).\n\nPeter Dutton has also said the Coalition will set a target for total migration (known as net overseas migration) during the campaign.\n\nIt would also reduce the number of refugee and humanitarian places offered each year from 20,000 to 13,750.\n\nThe Coalition would also raise fees for student visas above their current price of $1,600, and has promised to impose \"tougher caps\" on foreign students after rejecting Labor's legislation to limit international student numbers, though has not detailed what those would be.\n\nAnd it would ensure the deportation of \"non-citizen criminals\".\n\nLaw and order\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has promised $157 million over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco, with the tobacco black market draining government coffers and causing violence in Victoria and NSW.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition would give police new powers to stop and search people using detector wands, and restrict the sale and possession of knives to minors and \"dangerous individuals\".\n\nTargeting family violence offenders, the Coalition would also create an offence for using a carriage service to cause an intimate partner or family member to fear for their safety, or track them using spyware, or engage in coercive behaviours \u2014 with toughened bail laws for these offences.\n\nThe Coalition would also criminalise posting material on social media that depicts violence, drug offences or property offences in order to increase a person's notoriety, punishable by up to two years' prison and bans from those platforms.\n\nLaws that create mandatory minimum jail terms for all acts of terror, and for the display of Nazi symbols and terror symbols were passed in February with bipartisan support, after the Coalition promised to do so at the beginning of this year.\n\nTax\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will deliver two \"modest\" tax cuts, the first on July 1 next year, and the second on July 1, 2027. Those will reduce the lowest tax bracket from 16 per cent to 15 per cent in year one, and then to 14 per cent in year two.\n\nThe already legislated cuts would hand about $5 a week back to taxpayers from July 2026 and a total $10 a week back from July 2027, at a cost to the budget of 17.1 billion over four years.\n\nLabor will also commit $2 billion to production credits for aluminium smelters which only use renewable energy in their production process. Facilities will be eligible for support for every tonne of clean aluminium produced.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will temporarily halve the tax on fuel, which will reduce the wholesale price of petrol and diesel by about 25 cents. If those savings are passed on to consumers in full it will save them about $14 on the average weekly refuel.\n\nIn exchange for that 12 month discount on fuel, the Coalition has vowed to reverse legislated tax cuts passed by Labor on the eve of the election, saying the halved fuel excise will be worth more to voters.\n\nThe Coalition will offer tax deductions up to $20,000 for business-related meal expenses for small businesses. The Coalition says it expects that policy to cost less than $250 million and to run for an initial two years.\n\nThe Coalition will also lift the limit for how much small businesses can immediately deduct from their taxes for purchased assets from $20,000 to $30,000 \u2014 known as the instant asset write-off.\n\nIt will also dismantle more than $16 billion in tax credits due to be made available to critical minerals and green hydrogen producers under Labor's \"Future Made in Australia\" agenda.\n\nAnd the Coalition will restore a self-imposed cap on how much tax can be raised by the Commonwealth. The previous Coalition government had a target of taxes being no larger than 23.9 per cent of Australia's GDP, but it was dropped by Treasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\nIndustrial Relations\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will ban non-compete clauses which restrict workers from moving to a competing employer, or from starting a competing business.\n\nThe party says the clauses have become commonplace in worker contracts and are suppressing wages, particularly for the low paid.\n\nThe ban will apply to workers earning less than $175,000, and similar 'no poach' agreements that block staff from being hired by competitors will also be banned.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will mandate a return to the office for federal public servants, ending work from home arrangements that became normal during the pandemic.\n\nThe party has also promised to unwind much of Labor's industrial relations agenda if it wins government.\n\nIt would re-establish the construction industry watchdog, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which was attempted by former PMs Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull (who ultimately succeeded), and then abolished by Anthony Albanese in 2023.\n\nThe Coalition would also repeal \"right to disconnect\" laws, which prevent employers from punishing their staff if they do not respond to \"unreasonable\" calls or emails outside of work hours.\n\nAnd they would simplify the definition of a casual employee to make it clearer who is a casual.\n\nThey have not yet detailed whether they would change or dump Labor's \"same job same pay\" laws, which require employers to pay workers from labour hire firms the same as ordinary employees, but have promised to review those laws.\n\nSeparately, the Coalition has promised US-style anti-racketeering laws, that would allow bosses of organisations engaged in a pattern of illegal activity to be charged.ins\n\nMental Health\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will provide an additional $46 million over four years to establish an ongoing digital mental health service it committed to earlier in its term.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will permanently restore the number of subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20 for people with a mental health care plan. The subsidy was extended during the pandemic but lapsed under the previous government.\n\nIt has also promised to invest $400 million more into youth mental health services, and expand the National Centre for Excellence in Youth Mental Health.\n\nThat money will also be spent on boosting regional services and \"place Australia at the forefront of youth mental health treatment in the world\".\n\nEducation\n\nLabor\n\nThe Albanese government has promised to raise the minimum income threshold before graduates must begin repaying student loan debts, as well as cutting how much has to be repaid.\n\nFrom July next year, repayments would not begin until people are earning at least $67,000, and the rate at which they must repay would be more closely tied to how much above that amount they are earning \u2014 which the government says will mean a person earning $70,000 would pay around $1,300 less per year in repayments.\n\nThe government has promised to cut a further 20 per cent off all student loans as a one-off measure to reduce debts that grew massively over two years of high inflation. It says that will wipe about $5,520 off the average HELP debt of $27,600.\n\nIt would also double incentive payments to people who complete an apprenticeship related to housing construction to $10,000. Those payments would be made in instalments with first paid out at the six-month mark of an apprenticeship.\n\nCoalition\n\nA target of 400,000 apprentices and trainees in training would be set under the Coalition, with targeted incentive payments for employers to hire and train apprentices.\n\nSmall and medium businesses would recieve $12,000 to put on a new apprentice or trainee in critical skills areas for the first two years of their training.\n\nThe Coalition has promised to restore a curriculum that puts literacy and numeracy fundamentals at its core, and cultivates critical thinking and responsible citizenship.\n\nIt will announce its education policies closer to voting day.\n\nGovernment services\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has not announced any election commitments specific to government services.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition says it will find areas of \"waste\" in the public service and cut those jobs to save taxpayer money. While the Coalition won't commit to a number of jobs or savings target before the election, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has pointed to the 41,000 new jobs added since 2022, and has suggested cutting that number would save $24 billion over four years.\n\nGambling\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has not announced any election commitments specific to gambling.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will ban gambling advertising one hour before, during and after live sports on television and streaming services.\n\nSupermarkets\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will develop a $3 million education program to help suppliers negotiate better deals with the supermarket giants as part of its initial response to findings that Australian supermarkets are among some of the most profitable in the world, with little incentive to compete because of the market domination by Coles and Woolworths.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will legislate break up powers that could be used as a last resort tool to force Coles and Woolworths to sell off parts of their business, such as their alcohol arms, if they were found to be abusing their market power.\n\nThe Coalition has said it does not intend to use the powers, but they would act as a disincentive for the supermarket giants to engage in uncompetitive behaviour.\n\nDefence\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has not announced any election commitments specific to defence.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition has promised $3 billion to acquire extra joint strike fighter jets, after plans to buy an additional 28 fighter jets were scrapped last year in a re-prioritisation of defence spending. The Coalition will reverse that decision and lift Australia's F-35 fleet to 100.\n\nPeter Dutton has also signposted a \"significant funding commitment\" to be announced during the campaign.\n\nInternet\n\nLabor\n\nLabor would deliver a $3 billion equity injection into the NBN to deliver access to higher internet speeds for around 622,000 additional premises by the end of the decade. It would mean 94 per cent of homes would have access to speeds up to 1 Gbps.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will match Labor's $3 billion commitment for faster broadband.\n\nSocial media\n\nLabor\n\nLabor would compel social media companies to strike commercial deals with news organisations to support journalism. A charge would be imposed on Facebook, Instagram, Google and TikTok which they would be able to entirely offset by renewing or entering into deals to pay Australian news organisations.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition would outlaw what it calls criminal \"posting and boasting\", making it an offence to post material that glamorises violence, drug and property crimes in order to increase a person's notoriety.",

    "text": "British pop singer Dua Lipa has won the dismissal of a lawsuit in New York accusing the British pop star of copying her 2021 megahit Levitating from a 1979 disco song.\n\nUS District Judge Katherine Polk Failla said L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer failed to show \"substantial similarity\" between Levitating and their song Wiggle and Giggle All Night, though some listeners could hear similarities.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Levitating copied its signature melody from Wiggle and Giggle All Night and another song, called Don Diablo, to which they held a copyright.\n\nBut the judge found that melody unprotectable in light of November's federal appeals court decision that Ed Sheeran's 2014 song Thinking Out Loud did not illegally copy Marvin Gaye's classic Let's Get It On.\n\nFailla also found several other alleged similarities between Levitating and Wiggle and Giggle all Night were commonplace, having appeared in Mozart and Rossini operas, Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees.\n\n\"A musical style, defined by plaintiffs as 'pop with a disco feel,' and a musical function, defined by plaintiffs to include 'entertainment and dancing',\" cannot possibly be protectable,\" Failla wrote.\n\nTo hold otherwise, she said, would \"completely foreclose the further development of music in that genre or for that purpose.\"\n\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs, Jason Brown, said they plan to appeal.\n\n\"This case has always been about standing up for the enduring value of original songwriting,\" Brown, who is L.

We want it to be looked after, not demolished or redeveloped into something,\" Ms Gillam said.\n\n\"We want to know that the jetty is going to remain.\"\n\nAugusta-Margaret River Shire president Julia Meldrum. (Supplied: Augusta-Margaret River Shire)\n\nAugusta-Margaret River Shire president Julia Meldrum said the decision was about public safety.\n\n\"Deterioration has occurred faster than anticipated, which has led to this sudden closure,\" said Ms Meldrum.\n\nMs Meldrum rejected local accusations of neglect, pointing to annual maintenance from the shire and an independent engineering report released every two years.\n\nOn Thursday night, the shire voted to spend $100,000 to either replace or refurbish the jetty, though Ms Meldrum said the former would be an expensive proposition.\n\n\"I can't say what is going to happen, but we will look at all the options and we will find whatever the most suitable and practical solution is,\" Ms Meldrum said.\n\nMs Meldrum sympathised with the public's disappointment.\n\n\"I love our jetties,\" she said.\n\n\"They are a place where we connect, where we connect with nature.\n\n\"They're a really important part of the fabric of our communities throughout Western Australia.\"\n\nWA's love affair with old jetties\n\nThe Esperance Tanker Jetty opened in 1935.

    "text": "The showpiece attractions of any Olympic Games are the venues where feats of sporting brilliance take place.\n\nIt is these arenas that provide the stages, the names of which echo throughout history as readily as the athletes who graced them.\n\nOften, but not exclusively, the preserve of the Games' flagship athletics competition, the \"main\" stadium at a Games can be legacy-defining in terms of architecture as well as scope.\n\nThe Gabba will no longer join the exulted list of venues to have been considered an Olympic Games' main stadium.\n\nInstead, a brand new, 63,000-capacity venue will be built in Victoria Park \u2014 the first new-build main Olympic stadium since London 2012 (although that is slightly disingenuous as Tokyo's 2020 stadium involved the rebuild of the entire existing stadium).\n\nSo much about the new stadium remains unknown \u2014 including its cost (the 100-day review estimated $3.785 billion) and design.\n\nBut from what we do know, how will it stack up against some of its predecessors?\n\nThe bigger the better? Perhaps not\n\nThe Sydney Olympics featured the largest Olympic stadium ever. (Getty Images: Allsport/Adam Pretty)\n\nWith a proposed capacity of 63,000, the Victoria Park stadium would become the third-largest stadium in the country behind Australia's two existing Olympic stadiums, the MCG (100,024) and the Sydney Olympic stadium (82,000).\n\nDuring the 2000 Games, Sydney's Olympic stadium could contain 110,000 (although 114,714 watched the closing ceremony), making it the largest Olympic stadium ever.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, some 103,000 people packed the stands of the MCG. (Getty Images)\n\nThe capacity of the MCG during the 1956 Olympics was 103,000, making it the third-largest Olympic stadium ever behind Sydney and Berlin's magnificent neoclassical Olympiastadion (110,000).\n\nThe Berlin Olympiastadion is virtually unchanged from how it was in 1936, apart from the addition of a roof. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\nWhen compared just to those behemoths, the proposed Victoria Park stadium seems relatively small.\n\nAnd there is a case for that \u2014 its relatively modest size would make Victoria Park the smallest main stadium for an Olympic Games since Amsterdam's 1926 Olympisch Stadion, which held just 31,600.\n\nThe 1928 Amsterdam Olympics were played out in front of a realtively modest crowd. (Getty Images: ullstein bild)\n\nBut in actual fact, the capacity is actually in line with what a lot of Olympic stadiums tend to pitch themselves at.\n\nIndeed, Brisbane does not need a stadium any larger than this and to blow out the capacity would risk turning the arena into the palest of white elephants.\n\nBrisbane is, after all, the smallest city by population to host a Summer Olympic Games since Helsinki in 1952.\n\nThe proposed capacity of 63,000 was not a wild stab in the dark, either.\n\nThe 100-day report by the Games Independent Infrastructure and Coordination Authority (GIICA) noted that Queensland had the lowest provision of major sporting stadium seating capacity of the five most populous states compared to population, at 60 people per seat.\n\nMajor sporting stadium seat per person in Australia's five largest states. (Supplied: Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games Infrastructure Report)\n\nVictoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia have an average of 36 people per seat.\n\nBeing a bit smaller than the nations' other Olympic stadiums may make the Victoria Park stadium an anomaly domestically, but in fact it's very much in keeping with what we'd expect.\n\nWhat about the pool?\n\nThe new National Aquatic Centre in Brisbane will be a second showpiece stadium for the Games. (Supplied: Archipelago)\n\nThe proposed new Aquatic Centre at the site of the current Centenary Pool however, is going to be mighty big.\n\nWith a proposed Games capacity of 25,000 \u2014 which will be reduced to a permanent seated capacity of 8,800 \u2014 the venue would be the third-largest to ever host swimming at a Games.\n\nAnd that would be fitting, in a country where swimmers are lauded like no other, with the possible exception of the United States.\n\nThe Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena created a phenomenal atmosphere. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nIn Paris, the pool was the second-largest venue by capacity with 15,220 seats which, in keeping with its commitment to reusing existing stadiums, were housed inside the refitted Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena.\n\nAfter the Games it returned to its normal use as a home ground for Top 14 rugby union club, Racing 92.\n\nThe swimming in LA will be an astonishing spectacle. (Supplied: LA28)\n\nLos Angeles will also go big with its swimming venue, but with even greater scope, using SoFi Stadium \u2014 the home ground of LA's two NFL teams, the Chargers and the Rams \u2014 to create the largest swimming pool-only venue in Olympic history at 38,000.\n\nIncidentally, it's not the largest ever \u2014 the 100m long pool for the 1908 Games was situated in the infield of the 93,000-capacity White City Stadium in London.\n\nThe new National Aquatic Centre will be a statement venue for Australia's swimming future \u2014 Swimming Australia's chief executive Rob Woodhouse called it \"the most significant investment ever in aquatic sports in Australia\" that has the potential to set up the sport \"for ongoing success for the next 50 years\".\n\nBut the statement could also be in its design.\n\nThe Water Cube is one of the most distinctive venues in Olympic history. (Getty Images: Peter Bischoff)\n\nBeijing's Water Cube is one of the most staggering and distinctive pieces of sporting architecture in the world.\n\nLondon's Aquatic Centre and its undulating roof is the design vision of Zaha Hadid and remains a focal point for the whole Queen Elizabeth II Olympic Park.\n\nWhoever ends up designing the finished product, they have a huge task on their hands.\n\nA blank, golden canvas\n\nThe Beijing Olympic stadium was as distinctive as it was spectacular. (Getty Images: Clive Rose)\n\nYou might expect that Olympics tend to build brand new stadiums at huge expense as a par for the course, but the trend overall is to make use of existing venues.\n\nLast year's Games in Paris, for example, had as its feature arena a ground that's actually older than the redevelopment of Brisbane's Lang Park, the 1998-built Stade de France.\n\nThe otherworldly exterior of the Stade de France rises like a UFO among the low-rise buildings of Saint-Denis. (Getty Images: Corbis/Tim Clayton)\n\nThe 2021 Games took place in the same location as the 1964 Olympics \u2014 but the Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was completely rebuilt on the site of the old national stadium at a cost of 157 billion yen ($1.6 billion).\n\nThe Rio Games too made use of a redeveloped existing stadium, the historic Maracan\u00e3 for its opening and closing ceremonies, while the athletics was held at the smaller Est\u00e1dio Nilton Santos, which was also an existing stadium.\n\nThe LA Games will make history by using the same stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, for the third time. It was also the main stadium in both 1932 and 1984.\n\nThe LA Coliseum has been in use since 1923. (Getty Images: Corbis/Dick Whittington Studio)\n\nHowever, London (2012) and Beijing (2008) both built brand-new stadiums as their flagship feature pieces, as did Sydney (2000) and Atlanta (1996).\n\nOlympic stadium New/Existing Centennial Olympic Stadium, Atlanta New Stadium Australia, Sydney New Olympic Stadium, Athens Existing National Stadium, Beijing New Olympic Stadium, London New Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3, Rio Existing Olympic Stadium, Tokyo Rebuilt Stade de France, Paris Existing Los Angeles Memorial Colosium, LA Existing Victoria Park, Brisbane New\n\nBefore that, 10 of the previous 12 Games, stretching from Barcelona 1992 to London 1948, all used pre-existing venues.\n\nThe only exceptions were the Games in Munich and Montreal in the 1970s \u2014 both of which were architectural marvels, albeit with contrasting legacies.\n\nThe Munich Olympiastadion had an innovative tent-like roof. (Getty Images)\n\nIt took Montreal 30 years to pay off its revolutionary stadium, earning it the nickname The Big Owe and cementing Montreal as the poster child for the excesses and frivolity of the Olympic movement \u2014 its total overrun was estimated at over 700 per cent of its budget.\n\nThe Montreal Olympic stadium is an enormously expensive architectural marvel. (Getty Images: Tom Szczerbowski)\n\nThose Games were fraught with issues for the organisers.\n\nMany African nations boycotted the Games after the IOC refused to ban New Zealand after that year's All Black tour of South Africa went ahead in defiance of the Apartheid ban, while Canada became the first and only nation in history not to win a single gold medal at their own Olympics, winning just 11 overall.\n\nGiven Australia's stunning record in the pool and elsewhere in Olympic Games, one thinks we'd be safe in assuming that a lack of gold medal success won't be an issue for Australia in Brisbane, certainly in the pool.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "On some level, most of us know that reality TV is pretty far from reality.\n\nBut can these shows really make contestants say something they never said?\n\nIt's a question that went viral on TikTok during the latest iteration of famously controversial reality show Married at First Sight, now in its 12th season.\n\nSeeking reassurance from her new husband Ryan, bride Jacqui asks: \"How hard is it to [say] \u2026 hey you're f***ing gorgeous?\"\n\nHe responds: \"That would be a lie.\"\n\nJacqui and Ryan have had a dramatic story arc in this season of MAFS, but just how much of it has been influenced by 'the edit'? (Supplied: Nine)\n\nIt was a spicy moment of TV, and it caught the attention of reality star and media personality Abbie Chatfield, who doubted the scene really played out that way.\n\nIn a video she made in response to this moment \u2014 and the furore it was causing among viewers \u2014 she unpacked a practice known as \"frankenbiting\", which she says makes it \"too easy\" to put words in someone's mouth.\n\n\"The first sign you should always watch out for is if it's a voiceover, not vision of them in the scene saying the words,\" she said.\n\nShe speculated that Ryan's hurtful response was said in a totally different context, then just played over the clip for dramatic effect.\n\nLoading TikTok content\n\n\"I could be wrong but I really don't think, with all the context clues, that he actually said that to her.\"\n\nWhat actually is frankenbiting?\n\nLike Frankenstein's monster, frankenbiting involves creating something new from lots of smaller parts.\n\nBut instead of creating a new man, the editing technique uses individual words or phrases from other sentences, and turns them into new, reconstructed ones.\n\nRebecca Trelease is a senior lecturer specialising in reality TV at the Auckland University of Technology, and a former contestant on The Bachelor New Zealand.\n\nShe says hearing her own franken-sentences was \"the weirdest experience\".\n\n\"We were miked up from first thing in the morning until finishing filming at the end of the evening, like 13- or 14-hour days,\" Trelease says.\n\n\"You only have to say a specific word once, and then they have it \u2026 Every night, it's ingested into the system and [they can] search out that word.\"\n\nWhile she says this can be used to condense a long spiel into a five-second clip, it's also possible to edit in this way for \"nefarious reasons\".\n\n\" You can have someone say [something in a] completely different context to what they had originally said. \"\n\nJohn, whose name has been changed for privacy, has been an editor for decades, including on Married at First Sight (MAFS).\n\nHe says the practice is better known as franken-grabbing in Australian TV, and while he understands it has \"the potential to be manipulative\", he says he's never seen a production team misrepresent someone's intent.\n\n\"It might be where you want to show contestants have bad feelings about each other, and they haven't said that exactly, but [from all the different information you have], you know they have bad feelings.\"\n\nHe says in these cases, when an \"emotion might not be as well expressed in the way they [originally] said it\", franken-grabbing helps portray that storyline more clearly.\n\nHow reality shows create plot and story\n\nThe thing about reality dating shows like MAFS, says Trelease, is that if a couple is working well together, they won't get as much screen time.\n\n\"We're not watching it for love. We're watching it for disagreements and tantrums and fighting.\"\n\nCouple-based reality programs like The Ultimatum: Queer Love are all about conflict. (Netflix)\n\nBut she says even producers can't foresee a sudden fight, and this unpredictability means they sometimes have to work backwards to make that new plot line add up.\n\nIn producer interviews on The Bachelor, she remembers being asked to react to things that happened days earlier.\n\nChit Chat: Abbie Chatfield Photo shows Abbie Chatfield stands in front of a tropical villa locale, similing in a dress with swirling bright colours. As host of Australia's silliest dating show, Abbie Chatfield spends her days poking fun at soft boys. But the show is inspiring real conversations.\n\n\"Content in the story is being created on the fly all the time, it's very skilful.\n\n\"Creating a sentence [with frankenbiting] is so that it can either justify the narrative or scene that is happening\" in any particular episode.\n\nJohn says programs are shot with 6 or even 12 cameras, with every participant wearing a mic, creating \"miles\" of footage that no-one will ever see.\n\n\"People think you have 60 minutes and you cut it down to 10, and that's what editing is. But I don't think of it like that at all.\n\n\"You have hours and hours of footage, and you pull bits out, and you construct something with it \u2026 you show the highlights, you show the interesting bits.\"\n\nIs the 'villain edit' a real thing?\n\nAs Trelease explains, a program like The Bachelor focuses on multiple women vying for one man's love, each fitting their own stereotype and character, while couple shows like MAFS rely on the push and pull between two people.\n\nThis means one tends to be presented as the good guy, and the other as the bad guy.\n\nWhen watching shows like Love Is Blind, we tend to take sides as an audience. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\n\"Even if [there's] not necessarily a villain edit, it's the sense of, 'We're not meant to be siding with you,'\" she says.\n\n\" Quite often, their arguments aren't being presented equally \u2026 we're being guided towards liking one person in this relationship over the other. \"\n\nIn her TikTok, Abbie Chatfield points to the way music is used to make the audience feel a certain way about a character or scene; silly, moody or tense backing tracks all play into our emotions.\n\nLife as MAFS' 'most hated' villain Photo shows Online trolls told Olivia Frazer she was 'the most hated person in Australia' How far do reality programs go to create \"villains\" and \"psychos\"?\n\nJohn says while contestants complain about being misrepresented by the show or the editing process, he has his doubts.\n\n\"I think contestants use the understanding that people think [these shows are] artificial and constructed for their own benefit.\"\n\nTrelease says, given the editing involved in any reality show, it's impossible to definitively say if someone really is being misrepresented.\n\n\"I find it really interesting, where that line would be: how much of it is actually the participant, versus how much of the 'villain' comes from the edit?\"\n\nHow to spot frankenbiting for yourself\n\nIf you're keen to try to pick up on frankenbiting at home, John says to keep an ear out for tone changes.\n\n\" People are in different rooms when they're interviewed \u2026 they're different distances from the microphone, so the tone of the voice changes from word to word. \"\n\nTrelease finds it easier to tell when she's half-watching a show with headphones on while cooking dinner.\n\n\"Sometimes, the visuals are used to confuse you [so] you won't pick up the audio changes,\" she explains.\n\n\"But if you listen to it independently, you can actually hear it's different audio because it's from a different sentence, not a different angle.\"\n\nSeeing a full sentence come out of someone's mouth, on camera, is sometimes the only sure way to know it's unedited. (Supplied: Nine)\n\nJohn says in his early days of franken-grabbing, \"a lot of effort\" was made to make audio sound \"seamless and believable\".\n\n\"I think the expectation from the audience has changed now.\n\n\"The audience knows it happens and, for that reason, I don't think people camouflage it very well.\"\n\nAs someone who's spent decades editing on a variety of television formats, John admits he's \"not a big fan\" of the practice.\n\n\"It really annoys me that producers expect me to put together these words that don't sound right together, and that everyone will tell is fake. That frustrates me.\n\n\"I think that what people say is what they should be saying.\"",

    "text": "Liam Lawson has suffered one of the more ruthless axings in Formula 1, and his replacement will need to overcome a temperamental car and a dysfunctional team or be at risk of a similar fate.\n\nRed Bull officially announced on Thursday that Kiwi Lawson, a young driver of just 11 grands prix and promoted to the team in the off-season, is being replaced after just two rounds.\n\nThe dream job of driving for a team who wants to contend for world titles was an unmitigated nightmare for Lawson, who did not score points in either grand prix, or the sprint race in China.\n\nIn justifying axing Lawson for Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull boss Christian Horner said:\n\n\" We have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and together, we see that after such a difficult start, it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with \u2026 Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well. \"\n\nHorner can call the switch a \"duty of care\", but this Red Bull sacking is not an indictment of Lawson, but a glaring failure of the team.\n\nIt is this failure that Tsunoda is stepping into and must overcome to survive the curse of being Max Verstappen's teammate.\n\nWhen Tsunoda takes to the grid next week in front of his home fans in Suzuka, he will be Verstappen's fifth different teammate since 2019.\n\nKiwi racer axed by Red Bull after two F1 races Photo shows Liam Lawson of New Zealand and Red Bull looking down, running hand through his hair Kiwi Formula 1 racer Liam Lawson's stint as a Red Bull driver has come to a screeching halt, axed from the team after just two grands prix.\n\nMore alarmingly, he will be the fourth to come from Red Bull's junior team.\n\nRed Bull is unique in the world of F1 \u2014 it controls two teams.\n\nIn theory, Racing Bulls (formerly known as RB, AlphaTauri and Torro Rosso) should serve as a stepping stone for drivers in the Red Bull program to enter F1, and work their way to the main Red Bull Racing team.\n\nIt is an advantage that no other F1 team has, yet it seems to fail time and time again.\n\nAt least that is the plan.\n\nWhile Verstappen, Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo all had success going from the junior team to the big boys, for most, it has been their downfall.\n\nJapanese driver Yuki Tsunoda will debut for Red Bull at his home Formula 1 grand prix. (Getty Images: Rudy Carezzevoli)\n\nPierre Gasly was dumped after just 12 races in 2019, after making the step up from the junior team. The Frenchman was replaced by Alex Albon, who lasted 26 races before Red Bull cut him loose.\n\nAnd the problems date back further, with Daniil Kvyat being dumped early in his second season, replaced by Verstappen, who rubbed salt into the wounds by winning his debut race for the top team.\n\nLawson is just the latest driver to be chewed up and spat out, and evidence would suggest Tsunoda could be in for a similar world of hurt.\n\nIt is a sign that something is not working at Red Bull, a surprising thought considering Verstappen has won the previous four drivers' championships.\n\nBut with a rotating cast of teammates who are being well beaten by the Dutch ace, it begins to feel as if Verstappen's legendary brilliance has been masking fundamental flaws in the team.\n\nPiastri wins Chinese grand prix Photo shows F1 driver Oscar Piastri smiles as he hugs McLaren boss Zak Brown on the track at the Chinese Grand Prix. Australian Formula 1 driver Oscar Piastri has won the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai after starting on pole for the first time.\n\nIt was only two years ago to the day when the F1 world descended on Melbourne for the 2023 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nRed Bull had a history-making season in 2022, and their drivers, Verstappen and Perez had each won in the opening two rounds.\n\nThe rest of the field was not within coo-ee of Red Bull.\n\nIn that 2023 season, people did not tune into F1 to see who was going to win. They wanted to see by how much Red Bull, mainly Verstappen, would win.\n\nThe Red Bull of 2023 was so much better than the rest of the F1 field it was almost laughable. The nine other teams were competing in a different category to the world champions.\n\nSince then, Red Bull's car has acted like it has a mind of its own.\n\nRed Bull suffered a spectacular fall in 2024. After appearing to be cruising to another constructors' championship after 10 rounds, the wheels seemed to fall off and the team placed third, behind McLaren and Ferrari.\n\nRed Bull driver Max Verstappen has won the previous four F1 drivers' championships. (AP: Andre Penner)\n\nAt one point it looked as if Verstappen's drivers' championship was under threat, despite winning seven of the first 10 grands prix \u2014 two sensational drives in Brazil and Qatar ensured at least the drivers' championship would stay with Red Bull.\n\nBehind the scenes Red Bull has gone through backroom turmoil in the past 18 months, with a texting scandal, rumours of a power struggle, and the departure of F1 car design maestro Adrian Newey.\n\nThis year's Red Bull car, the RB21, has difficulties that need addressing.\n\nThe chaotic nature of the Red Bull car was abundantly clear in last weekend's Chinese Grand Prix when Verstappen was well off the pace to start the race, then his car came to life and he was, at times, the quickest on track.\n\nBut with a regulation overhaul next season, the team will increasingly prioritise the 2026 challenger as this year goes on.\n\nThe car's inconsistency will be a hurdle for Verstappen to overcome in his bid to win races but for Tsunoda, like Lawson, it could be a hurdle for him even staying with the team.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nTsundoa is clearly Red Bull's second choice, after the team paid Mexican Sergio Perez a heap of money to break his contract at the end of 2024.\n\nThe Japanese driver had four years' experience with the junior team, but Red Bull chose the Kiwi with just 11 races over two seasons.\n\nDespite Tsunoda driving brilliantly to start this season \u2014 cruelled in both grands prix by bad strategy calls from his team \u2014 the step up to the main Red Bull team must feel like trying to summit Everest without food or water.\n\nUnlike Lawson, again the driver Red Bull chose first, Tsundoa doesn't have the benefit of a full pre-season with the team. He has been preparing to drive the secondary car, which, despite being slower, looks much easier to drive.\n\nThe RB21 has the raw performance to contend for titles, but it is not smooth to drive. It may be that Verstappen is the only driver on the grid who could succeed in the monster that is the RB21.\n\nBut what happens if Tsunoda doesn't hit the ground running?\n\nIt is a scenario Red Bull will need to think about because history suggests it is a real possibility.\n\nOther teams at the top of the sport have allowed young drivers to thrive.\n\nMcLaren has both Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris firing on all cylinders, while teenager Andrea Kimi Antonelli has shone in his first two races with Mercedes.\n\nOliver Bearman, now with Haas, scored points in his debut last season when he filled in for Ferrari on short notice, and Alpine reserve driver Franco Colapinto achieved two top-10 finishes when he was plucked from F2 into the Williams team in mid-2024.\n\nBut Red Bull has not been a happy hunting ground for most young drivers, and this is an issue Red Bull needs to address desperately, or risk falling behind its rivals as they enter a new regulation era in F1.",

    "text": "The past fortnight has been a busy time for the 25 elected members of the Northern Territory parliament.\n\nOver six sitting days, six pieces of legislation have been introduced and five bills passed through the NT's only parliamentary chamber.\n\nOn one extremely long day during the two-week sitting, MLAs remained in the chamber until 1:30am to pass a particularly controversial bill.\n\nHere's what happened.\n\nTerritory Coordinator Bill passes\n\nThe Territory Coordinator Bill has been described by the Country Liberal Party (CLP) government as the \"most important economic reform\" in a decade.\n\nIt faced strong opposition from groups including environmental organisations and land councils.\n\nIn passing the bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, the government created the role of the territory coordinator \u2014 a statutory officer with a broad range of powers to \"consolidate regulatory processes\" for projects of \"economic significance\".\n\nThe new laws also allow the territory coordinator minister, who is Chief Minister Lia Finocchiaro, to modify or exclude other NT laws applicable to the same projects.\n\nLia Finocchiaro is the chief minister and territory coordinator minister. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nThere are 32 acts of parliament that the territory coordinator and minister can now override to \"achieve efficient and effective regulation\", including the building, water, environment protection and radiation protection acts.\n\nThe bill passed after the government accepted eight of 25 recommendations from a parliamentary scrutiny committee controlled by the CLP. Two were accepted in part.\n\nChansey Paech, Labor's representative on the scrutiny committee, said the CLP had ignored its own backbench by rejecting the other 15 recommendations.\n\nChansey Paech represents Labor on the scrutiny committee. (ABC News: Pete Garnish )\n\nIn the second sitting week, the government also passed legislation to repeal third-party merits reviews from the NT's petroleum, planning and water acts.\n\nThe change removes the right of third parties like environmental organisations to review the merits of government decisions at the NT's Civil and Adminstrative Tribunal (NTCAT).\n\nIt hinders future NTCAT challenges against developments including Beetaloo Basin fracking projects, which have faced criticism over fluid spills and water contamination risks.\n\nRobyn Lambley is the independent speaker of the NT parliament. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nWhat other legislation passed?\n\nThe government's Education Legislation Amendment Bill passed last Thursday, enshrining the role of school truancy officers into law.\n\nThe truancy officers have been on the beat for months already, handing parents $370 fines and compliance notices if they fail to send their children to school.\n\nThe NT's $15 billion debt ceiling was also officially scrapped, while police were given \"express powers\" to enter private property and search for parole or domestic violence offenders.\n\nThe government has scrapped the NT's $15 billion debt ceiling. (ABC News: Randi Dahnial)\n\nWhat bills were introduced?\n\nThe government this week proposed laws to reinstate mandatory sentences for repeat breaches of domestic violence orders.\n\nThe former seven-day minimum mandatory sentence had been scrapped by the former Labor government in 2022, following a recommendation from the NT Law Reform Committee.\n\nA group of three NT women's legal services released a joint statement saying they hadn't been consulted on its reintroduction and the policy was not evidence-based.\n\nThe parliamentary sitting went over six days. (ABC News: Pete Garnish )\n\nThe Aboriginal Sacred Sites Legislation Amendment Bill was also introduced by the government.\n\nOne of the bill's proposed changes would allow authority certificates from the NT's sacred sites regulator to be transferred to new owners, rather than requiring them to apply for a new certificate.\n\nIt would also allow additional people to be added to a certificate, which permits work to be undertaken in or near a sacred site.\n\nBoth bills were referred to the scrutiny committee.\n\nOther government bills introduced include proposed reforms to:\n\nIncrease access to Aboriginal water reserves \u2014 portions of water set aside from larger pools for Indigenous people to use or trade.\n\n\u2014 portions of water set aside from larger pools for Indigenous people to use or trade. Remove portable long service leave for community service workers.\n\nAlter various pieces of legislation within the attorney-general's portfolio, including tightening restrictions on drugs such as fentanyl.\n\nChange the Local Government Act to \"modernise and amend terminology\".\n\nLabor's Chansey Paech (left) and Selena Uibo (right) were heavily involved in debate during the sitting fortnight. (ABC News: Pete Garnish )\n\nWhat else happened?\n\nThe government scrapped the NT's renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030, saying gas will instead supply the territory with most of its future energy needs.\n\nJo Hersey, the education minister, suggested remote students could access the government's free school swimming lesson policy by learning in \"massive big blow-up pools from Clark Rubber\".\n\nHousing Minister Steve Edgington also announced a plan to recoup $39 million in rent arrears from public housing tenants.\n\nA motion by independent MLA Justine Davis to establish a parliamentary inquiry on the defrauding of an Indigenous employment scheme was not debated, and will instead be voted on when parliament next sits in May.",

    "text": "Life is all about small steps for Nagmeldin Peter Bol.\n\nSix months ago, the Australian middle-distance running great and his partner Mahtut Yaynu welcomed their daughter, Reyna, into the world.\n\nFor Bol \u2014 a three-time Olympian \u2014 it's given him a perspective on life he couldn't have anticipated.\n\n\"It's been really special \u2026 it's been so beautiful in a way that you're just so focused and so structured, you also lose so much sleep at the same time, but you're able to perform so much better,\" Bol said.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"I thought I was (already) pretty focused, but there's always a little bit more that you can be focused on. Recovery is a little bit better right now, even though you sleep less.\n\n\"But the most precious thing is getting back home to your baby girl and to your family.\n\n\"So I'm spending a lot of time at home, and I'm refreshed and [have a] new perspective of life and everything. So, it's been great.\"\n\nPeter's pursuit of happiness\n\nLess than four years ago, Bol was on the tip of every tongue in Australian households, glued to their screens while watching the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nNow the 800m specialist says he's in the best space mentally to prepare for this season's goals, including a podium placing at the World Athletics Championships in Japan.\n\nBut the first step Bol sets his focus on is to maintain his wellbeing off the track.\n\nAfter a tough two years plagued by injuries and being exonerated from a case submitted by the World Anti-Doping Agency, he explained his mindset heading into the 2025 season.\n\nAfter a silver medal at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, Bol is aiming for a podium finish at this year's World Athletics Championships at Tokyo in September. (AP: Manish Swarup)\n\n\"I'm blessed to be in the state that I am now and quite happy mentally \u2026 I'm proud to say that I'm doing pretty well at the moment,\" Bol said.\n\n\"I believe a happy athlete is a performing athlete, and if I'm away from my family, I'm not happy.\n\n\"Family has always been one of my biggest values and now I've added my own family, so that's pretty powerful.\"\n\nBol is learning lessons as a young father have come quickly.\n\nExtending a branch on the family tree is a completely different experience and something he has been able to relate to his upbringing as his parents made many sacrifices on their move between continents.\n\n\"Your gratitude for your partner is off the roof. You realise what they go through and how much they mean to you,\" Bol said.\n\n\"And to also your parents. You're like, 'Wow, like they've done this for so many years and then they've done it moving places to places'.\n\n\"It's been a really positive experience, and I wish I had it earlier.\"\n\nWhile the life of an athlete can be uniquely demanding with international travel and living away from home, Bol plans to return to Australia between events, rather than base himself overseas for months on end.\n\n\"If I'm not performing, there's no point. So, it's just (about) being at home and finding my place,\" he said.\n\n\"She (Reyna) gets to watch some of my races. My partner sends me videos of her watching and she's kind of recognising you in that. So, it's really cool.\n\n\"And then it's also scary, right? Because at the Olympic Games, I was pretty calm and I could sense my parents were so stressed and nervous.\n\n\"And I think as she grows older, she's going to start feeling that and as she starts competing and doing different sports I'm going to start feeling that.\"\n\nBeyond Bol pays it forward\n\nBol's well-earned reputation as someone passionate about helping others in the athletics community has allowed him to recently set up the Beyond Bol Foundation.\n\nThe organisation aims to give the next generation of young Africans and under-represented communities an opportunity in Australian athletics.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"It's quite beautiful, it's quite emotional,\" he said.\n\n\" Twenty-one years ago I wasn't an Australian citizen \u2026 14 years ago I was given this great opportunity by a high school teacher to do athletics. \"\n\nHe hopes to inspire the next generation of talent from the grassroots level, to a pathway at the top of the sport.\n\nAge may be a factor for the 31-year-old by the time a home Olympics in Brisbane comes around in 2032, but it's something he's eyeing as a mentor to younger athletes.\n\n\"So for me, it's beyond myself, it's beyond the sport. It's the reasons we've travelled so far and moved to be here.\n\n\"To be able to put on that green and gold and represent your country and your culture, so many people, it's quite beautiful.\"\n\nPeter Bol has had a hot start to the season, winning the Men's 800m final at the 2025 Sydney Track Classic in March. (Getty Images: Jason McCawley)\n\nPeak performance one race at a time\n\nAfter a difficult campaign at the Paris Olympics last year, finishing seventh in his 800m heat, Bol's long-term ambition is to join a rare club of quadruple Olympians at the LA Games in 2028.\n\n\"Paris was quite disappointing. I had to come home and reflect on that and then re-evaluate and move on to this year,\" he said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I just ran my fastest time I've ever ran in around March, which is pretty cool.\n\n\"My goal is to be a fourth-time Olympian and to win a global medal.\"\n\nWith one eye on the present and another on the future, a slate of meets across the country includes next month's national championships in Perth.\n\nThe next small step for Bol is taking on the track this weekend at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne.\n\n\"I always said you need to be the best in your country before trying to tackle the world and I'm looking forward to doing that,\" the former national record holder and national champion said.\n\nA key part of his preparation for the event is about \"staying in the moment\", with the experienced runner taking on a high-class field of athletes at this year's stacked John Landy 1500m.\n\n\"Australian athletics is in such a special place in so many different ways,\" he said.\n\n\"As long as I've been competing, it's probably the best I've seen it.\"\n\nPerhaps the stars are finally aligning this year for Bol, much like the meaning of his first name Nagmeldin in the Arabic language.",

    "text": "She says the findings have important implications for shaping public health policies. \u201cTraditionally, dietary guidelines have focused on preventing chronic diseases like heart disease. Our study highlights the potential for dietary recommendations to consider not only disease prevention but also promoting healthy ageing as a long-term goal.\u201d Aussie diets on the decline Despite a growing wellness industry worth $US1.3 trillion ($2.07 trillion) and long-term growth in Australian spending on health, dietary habits aren\u2019t necessarily changing for the better. New research from the CSIRO, published earlier this month, predicted Australian diets would worsen by 2030, with the intake of discretionary foods (ultra-processed foods and sugary drinks) to rise 18 per cent and the intake of fruit to decline 10 per cent. Vegetable intake remained steady, but was far below recommended levels.\n\nUsing predictive modelling techniques, researchers analysed nine years of self-reported data from more than 275,000 Australians to forecast dietary trends and compare them with national guidelines. Their findings suggest drastic change is needed if we are to meet these targets in five years. Australia\u2019s National Preventive Health Strategy outlines ambitious nutrition targets to reach by 2030: Two servings of fruit a day, five servings of vegetables a day, and reducing discretionary foods to less than 20 per cent of total energy intake. \u201cIt was concerning to see that Australian diet quality is declining, but we\u2019re hoping that this could be an early warning system to help get us back on track,\u201d says Dr Gilly Hendrie, a research scientist who co-authored the CSIRO study. Interestingly, young adults (18 to 30) were the only age group to show an increase in vegetable consumption, though their intake of discretionary foods remained high.\n\nStart young, and focus on prevention So, what needs to change? Professor Luigi Fontana, scientific director of the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre, whose team has been working with schools in NSW, says education is key. More than this, he says young people need to be taught the mechanisms behind healthy lifestyle choices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to tell them, \u2018Eat more fruits and vegetables and don\u2019t drink soda or [eat] processed food\u2019.\u201d Loading \u201cThis topic is as important as math, as English, as chemistry,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless students understand how different types of physical activity modulate some of these ageing and metabolic pathways, how different nutritional interventions change the risk of developing different diseases [for example], nothing will change.\u201d He thinks education programs should also give people the skills to put this new knowledge into action.\n\n\u201cMost people, even if they know that legumes are important, have no idea how to cook them; how to put together something that is healthy and tasty,\u201d he says. Fontana says more education also needs to go hand-in-hand with changes to our primary healthcare system to focus on prevention rather than managing chronic disease. Accessibility is another important factor, Hendrie says. \u201cThe availability and price of fresh produce around the country will make it easier for people to eat well at a community level, making it easier and the norm to have healthy lunchboxes for kids at school or healthy snacks at sport on the weekend,\u201d she says. It\u2019s never too late",

While \u201cI could do that\u201d is usually an insult when uttered in an art gallery, for any creatively inclined youngsters who might say it while attending Artexpress, it\u2019s proof of how inspiring it can be to see the unfiltered work of their peers. artgallery.nsw.gov.au\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmanda Lea Lavergne playing Grace Farrell (left), Beatrix Alder, who is one of the young performers playing Annie, and Anthony Warlow playing Oliver \u201cDaddy\u201d Warbucks during a rehearsal for Annie.

    "text": "Mackenzie laughs at memories of his dad carefully navigating their car up the hill to their house in Sp\u00e9rac\u00e8des so the family of six could go sightseeing or skiing. \u201cWe had a Renault Trafic that Dad had to try and get up the hill. [It] was always quite amusing watching him trying to squeeze it up there,\u201d Mackenzie said. Cam Mackenzie bears a striking resemblance to his coach Sam Mitchell, and they both started their careers in the same number guernsey. Credit: Getty / John Donegan \u201c[It was] very different to life here so it was cool to experience that.\u201d After the family returned to Melbourne\u2019s bayside, Mackenzie\u2019s life centred on education and football \u2013 at school, his local club Beaumaris, then the Sandringham Dragons. His background meant he was eligible to become part of St Kilda\u2019s Next Generation Academy at the age of 15 under the tutelage of former midfield star Nick Dal Santo.\n\nAs the rules dictating access to NGA graduates fluctuated and Mackenzie continued to develop, it became obvious to the Saints they would have to compete with every other club at the draft to snare the talented youngster. In his draft year, he played in Vic Metro\u2019s title-winning team, as well as premierships with Sandringham and Brighton Grammar, and became a certain top-10 pick. The No.28 reminds Hawks fans of their coach Sam Mitchell, who became a star. Credit: Getty Images At the same time, Hawthorn were in the midst of generational change. They traded experienced midfielders Jaeger O\u2019Meara (Fremantle) and Tom Mitchell (Collingwood). Liam Shiels and Ben McEvoy retired (although Shiels later joined North Melbourne) and Jack Gunston joined Brisbane. At the 2022 draft, the Hawks welcomed Mackenzie, Josh Weddle (pick 18), Henry Hustwaite (37), Jack O\u2019Sullivan (46) and Bailey McDonald (51). The club started afresh with young midfielders fighting for spots as they learned how to play together under Mitchell. They knew their athletic profile meant their game plan leaned a certain way, but improvement did not happen overnight. Mistakes were made. Some losses were by bigger margins than anyone enjoyed. Mackenzie chipped away on the wing, his classy ball use and composure evident without being breathtaking, initially.\n\n\u201cWe definitely took some time to figure out how [our game] was going to look and figure out where I fitted. And everyone else was trying to figure out where they fitted,\u201d Mackenzie said. Loading \u201cTowards the back end of the year, we did work that out, and the confidence and the belief just continued to grow.\u201d An ill-timed hamstring injury meant Mackenzie wasn\u2019t in the team last year when the Hawks beat the Western Bulldogs in the elimination final; their first final win at the MCG since the 2015 premiership. \u201cThe last training [session] before the game, I was doing a centre-bounce drill and just felt something grab. I knew it wasn\u2019t a serious thing and the scan showed that it wasn\u2019t serious, but it meant I had to miss,\u201d Mackenzie said.\n\nIt was his first notable injury. \u201cFor the first few days, I didn\u2019t really know what to think, and then \u2026 it was awesome we won, but it was hard to watch from the sideline knowing that I would have been out there,\u201d Mackenzie said. If the ball is on the ground, the Hawks\u2019 Cam Mackenzie won\u2019t be far away Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images \u201cIt has certainly motivated me heaps this pre-season [and] added fuel to the fire that next time I want to be out there. I definitely want to be there and be a part of the team.\u201d A solid fitness base built over the pre-season has given Mackenzie the confidence to run out games as he helped the Hawks to victories in their first three games. He has made an impression on the fans too, his straight-backed running style, mousey hair and ability to step players without much movement drawing comparisons to his coach.\n\nBut Mackenzie is taking nothing for granted, his gradual development replicating his dad\u2019s cautious drive up the hill in Sp\u00e9rac\u00e8des as he tries to squeeze into the Hawks midfield. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s been challenging to break in there. Last year, to play a bit more on the wing was good to find that second position where I can hopefully get some time [as an] inside mid, but then also have that secondary position,\u201d Mackenzie said. He\u2019s more Cannes than Hollywood Hawks, a player appreciated by Hawk fans, opponents and football lovers who watch the game closely. His emergence as a key midfielder at the Hawks has been gradual, his level-headed approach consistent with Hawthorn\u2019s personalities in that part of the ground. A smart operator, he is also fitting in a subject a semester as he studies for a Bachelor of Commerce at Monash University; keeping up the French is, however, proving more difficult.",

It is also a slashing of the federal workforce, which will ultimately affect government services,\" said Levitt, a former senior adviser to the White House and HHS under former president Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe planned FDA job cuts would not affect inspectors or reviewers of drugs, medical devices, or food, HHS said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terminations are likely to delay drug and medical device application reviews or cause missed deadlines, said Eva Temkin, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter who advises clients on drug and medical device applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a real risk that this results in delayed patient access to treatments,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, currently an independent HHS agency with 1,000 employees, will be folded into the CDC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NIH will see staff reductions across its 27 institutes and centres.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was comparatively spared with a reduction of about 300 employees. It was not immediately clear from which HHS divisions or offices the remaining 2,600 cuts would come.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the department's 10 regional offices will be cut to five and its 28 divisions consolidated into 15, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes centralise functions such as communications, human resources, IT, and policy planning that currently spread out across several health agencies, including the FDA, CDC, and NIH. Agencies report to the health secretary but have traditionally operated somewhat independently of HHS and the White House.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Parliament House, Opposition leader Peter Dutton began his budget reply speech by telling MPs Australia is at its \"sliding doors moment\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every election is important. But this election matters more than others in recent history. It's a 'sliding doors' moment for our nation. A returned Albanese Government in any form won\u2019t just be another three bleak years - more economic mistakes will take a lot longer to recover from, setbacks will be set in stone and our prosperity will be damaged for decades to come.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton has made his pitch to Australians, promising he'll focus on immigration, housing, health and community safety if he's elected as the next Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tonight, I commit a Dutton Coalition Government to the following. We will introduce four critical pieces of legislation on the first sitting day of the next Parliament. 1. The Energy Price Reduction Bill; 2. The Lower Immigration and More Homes for Australians Bill; 3. The Keeping Australians Safe Bill; and 4. The Guaranteed Funding for Health, Education and Essential Services Bill. This is my signal to Australian people of what my priorities will be in government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStressing his commitment to tackle the rising cost of living, Mr Dutton also announced several relief policies if the Coalition wins government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A Coalition government will halve the fuel excise for 12 months. And then will review it. And we will make sure that comes in on our first day our parliament sits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition also plans to abandon Labor's $20 billion Rewiring the Nation Fund, the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, and $16 billion of production tax credits for critical minerals and green hydrogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton also promised the Coalition would scale down the size of the public service, and instead invest in critical services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In line with our national interest, we will continue to invest in essential services and critical areas of the economy \u2013 like health, aged-care, veterans\u2019 support, the NDIS, Indigenous affairs, childcare and defence. We won't cut frontline service delivery roles. We will ensure the services Australians rely on are sustainable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of reducing the cost of energy, Mr Dutton says his government will invest $1 billion in a Critical Gas Infrastructure Fund to increase gas pipeline and storage capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also says the Coalition will cut the permanent migration program by 25 per cent, and implement stricter caps on international students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition will also offer a $400 million funding to support youth mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has responded to Mr Dutton's budget pitch, with Education Minister Jason Clare saying the Coalition will make Australians pay more tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true: if Peter Dutton wins the election, you will pay more tax. So the stage is now set. If Labor wins the election, your taxes will be lower; if Peter Dutton wins the election, your taxes will be higher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal election is set to be held on May 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Peter Dutton has promised to lower energy bills through a National Gas Plan, slash migration and cut thousands of federal public servants as part of his election pitch to voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his fourth budget reply speech, the Opposition leader has pledged to fast-track new gas projects, increase the small business instant asset write-off to $30,000 and cut migration by 25 per cent if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a sliding doors moment for our nation,\" Dutton said during his speech, adding: \"This election is as much about leadership as it's about policy.\"\n\n\n\nIt followed Labor revealing its budget plans on Tuesday .\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the key elements of Dutton's pitch to Australian voters.\n\n\n\nIntroducing a national gas plan to lower bills\n\nA Dutton government would immediately introduce a National Gas Plan to prioritise domestic supply of gas and drive down energy bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan includes fast-tracking new gas projects, halving approval times and launching a gas reservation plan, under which a certain amount of gas produced would be reserved for the domestic market.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton said it would \"secure an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the east coast\u2019s demand\" and would \"drive down new wholesale domestic gas prices from over $14 per gigajoule to under 10 per gigajoule\".\n\n\n\nThe policy could come at a loss to the industry, shifting gas destined for export at a higher price.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Australia has had a similar policy since 2006.\n\n\n\nCheaper fuel\n\nWith a clear focus on the hip pocket, the Coalition also revealed it will cut the fuel excise from about 50 cents to 25 cents per litre on its first sitting day.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would \"ensure that the fuel excise cut will be passed on in full to consumers\".\n\n\n\nSlashing migration\n\nDutton has confirmed the Coalition will cut the permanent migration program by 25 per cent if elected on 3 May.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the plan, levels currently set at 185,000 will be cut by an estimated 46,000 places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Labor is neither in control of migration, nor has it kept migration at sustainable levels,\" Dutton said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The federal election will be held on 3 May\n\nHe added the plan will free up housing and \"restore the great Australian dream of home ownership\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the commitment was made in last year's budget reply, it required clarity after the Opposition's treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor appeared to walk back the policy on Sunday's Insiders program.\n\n\n\nBoost to instant asset write-off for small businesses\n\nThe Albanese government extended a $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses, passing the legislation late on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his budget reply, Dutton has appealed to business owners by pledging to boost the write-off to $30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt adds on a previous promise to provide deductions of up to $20,000 per year for business-related meal expenses.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Revealed: The winners and losers of the 2025 federal budget\n\nCuts to public servants\n\nDutton has accused the Albanese government of \"ineffectual and wasteful\" spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says cutting 41,000 public servants hired under Labor will save the budget over $10 billion over the forward estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing concerns that the policy could affect essential services, including veterans' affairs, he said: \"We won\u2019t cut frontline service delivery roles\".\n\n\n\nInvesting in mental health and cheaper medicines\n\nAn $8.5 billion boost to Medicare is the centrepiece of Labor's election campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition will match the commitment, announcing a $9 billion investment in health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes delivering Labor's promise to lower prices of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme , capping most prescriptions to $25.\n\n\n\nDutton has committed to an additional $400 million towards youth mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will boost regional services and expand treatment to place Australia at the forefront of youth mental health treatment in the world,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "She says the findings have important implications for shaping public health policies. \u201cTraditionally, dietary guidelines have focused on preventing chronic diseases like heart disease. Our study highlights the potential for dietary recommendations to consider not only disease prevention but also promoting healthy ageing as a long-term goal.\u201d Aussie diets on the decline Despite a growing wellness industry worth $US1.3 trillion ($2.07 trillion) and long-term growth in Australian spending on health, dietary habits aren\u2019t necessarily changing for the better. New research from the CSIRO, published earlier this month, predicted Australian diets would worsen by 2030, with the intake of discretionary foods (ultra-processed foods and sugary drinks) to rise 18 per cent and the intake of fruit to decline 10 per cent. Vegetable intake remained steady, but was far below recommended levels.\n\nUsing predictive modelling techniques, researchers analysed nine years of self-reported data from more than 275,000 Australians to forecast dietary trends and compare them with national guidelines. Their findings suggest drastic change is needed if we are to meet these targets in five years. Australia\u2019s National Preventive Health Strategy outlines ambitious nutrition targets to reach by 2030: Two servings of fruit a day, five servings of vegetables a day, and reducing discretionary foods to less than 20 per cent of total energy intake. \u201cIt was concerning to see that Australian diet quality is declining, but we\u2019re hoping that this could be an early warning system to help get us back on track,\u201d says Dr Gilly Hendrie, a research scientist who co-authored the CSIRO study. Interestingly, young adults (18 to 30) were the only age group to show an increase in vegetable consumption, though their intake of discretionary foods remained high.\n\nStart young, and focus on prevention So, what needs to change? Professor Luigi Fontana, scientific director of the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre, whose team has been working with schools in NSW, says education is key. More than this, he says young people need to be taught the mechanisms behind healthy lifestyle choices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to tell them, \u2018Eat more fruits and vegetables and don\u2019t drink soda or [eat] processed food\u2019.\u201d Loading \u201cThis topic is as important as math, as English, as chemistry,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless students understand how different types of physical activity modulate some of these ageing and metabolic pathways, how different nutritional interventions change the risk of developing different diseases [for example], nothing will change.\u201d He thinks education programs should also give people the skills to put this new knowledge into action.\n\n\u201cMost people, even if they know that legumes are important, have no idea how to cook them; how to put together something that is healthy and tasty,\u201d he says. Fontana says more education also needs to go hand-in-hand with changes to our primary healthcare system to focus on prevention rather than managing chronic disease. Accessibility is another important factor, Hendrie says. \u201cThe availability and price of fresh produce around the country will make it easier for people to eat well at a community level, making it easier and the norm to have healthy lunchboxes for kids at school or healthy snacks at sport on the weekend,\u201d she says. It\u2019s never too late",

    "text": "Mackenzie laughs at memories of his dad carefully navigating their car up the hill to their house in Sp\u00e9rac\u00e8des so the family of six could go sightseeing or skiing. \u201cWe had a Renault Trafic that Dad had to try and get up the hill. [It] was always quite amusing watching him trying to squeeze it up there,\u201d Mackenzie said. Cam Mackenzie bears a striking resemblance to his coach Sam Mitchell, and they both started their careers in the same number guernsey. Credit: Getty / John Donegan \u201c[It was] very different to life here so it was cool to experience that.\u201d After the family returned to Melbourne\u2019s bayside, Mackenzie\u2019s life centred on education and football \u2013 at school, his local club Beaumaris, then the Sandringham Dragons. His background meant he was eligible to become part of St Kilda\u2019s Next Generation Academy at the age of 15 under the tutelage of former midfield star Nick Dal Santo.\n\nAs the rules dictating access to NGA graduates fluctuated and Mackenzie continued to develop, it became obvious to the Saints they would have to compete with every other club at the draft to snare the talented youngster. In his draft year, he played in Vic Metro\u2019s title-winning team, as well as premierships with Sandringham and Brighton Grammar, and became a certain top-10 pick. The No.28 reminds Hawks fans of their coach Sam Mitchell, who became a star. Credit: Getty Images At the same time, Hawthorn were in the midst of generational change. They traded experienced midfielders Jaeger O\u2019Meara (Fremantle) and Tom Mitchell (Collingwood). Liam Shiels and Ben McEvoy retired (although Shiels later joined North Melbourne) and Jack Gunston joined Brisbane. At the 2022 draft, the Hawks welcomed Mackenzie, Josh Weddle (pick 18), Henry Hustwaite (37), Jack O\u2019Sullivan (46) and Bailey McDonald (51). The club started afresh with young midfielders fighting for spots as they learned how to play together under Mitchell. They knew their athletic profile meant their game plan leaned a certain way, but improvement did not happen overnight. Mistakes were made. Some losses were by bigger margins than anyone enjoyed. Mackenzie chipped away on the wing, his classy ball use and composure evident without being breathtaking, initially.\n\n\u201cWe definitely took some time to figure out how [our game] was going to look and figure out where I fitted. And everyone else was trying to figure out where they fitted,\u201d Mackenzie said. Loading \u201cTowards the back end of the year, we did work that out, and the confidence and the belief just continued to grow.\u201d An ill-timed hamstring injury meant Mackenzie wasn\u2019t in the team last year when the Hawks beat the Western Bulldogs in the elimination final; their first final win at the MCG since the 2015 premiership. \u201cThe last training [session] before the game, I was doing a centre-bounce drill and just felt something grab. I knew it wasn\u2019t a serious thing and the scan showed that it wasn\u2019t serious, but it meant I had to miss,\u201d Mackenzie said.\n\nIt was his first notable injury. \u201cFor the first few days, I didn\u2019t really know what to think, and then \u2026 it was awesome we won, but it was hard to watch from the sideline knowing that I would have been out there,\u201d Mackenzie said. If the ball is on the ground, the Hawks\u2019 Cam Mackenzie won\u2019t be far away Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images \u201cIt has certainly motivated me heaps this pre-season [and] added fuel to the fire that next time I want to be out there. I definitely want to be there and be a part of the team.\u201d A solid fitness base built over the pre-season has given Mackenzie the confidence to run out games as he helped the Hawks to victories in their first three games. He has made an impression on the fans too, his straight-backed running style, mousey hair and ability to step players without much movement drawing comparisons to his coach.\n\nBut Mackenzie is taking nothing for granted, his gradual development replicating his dad\u2019s cautious drive up the hill in Sp\u00e9rac\u00e8des as he tries to squeeze into the Hawks midfield. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s been challenging to break in there. Last year, to play a bit more on the wing was good to find that second position where I can hopefully get some time [as an] inside mid, but then also have that secondary position,\u201d Mackenzie said. He\u2019s more Cannes than Hollywood Hawks, a player appreciated by Hawk fans, opponents and football lovers who watch the game closely. His emergence as a key midfielder at the Hawks has been gradual, his level-headed approach consistent with Hawthorn\u2019s personalities in that part of the ground. A smart operator, he is also fitting in a subject a semester as he studies for a Bachelor of Commerce at Monash University; keeping up the French is, however, proving more difficult.",

    "text": "\u201cWe know that modern families are busy, so Daily Growth has been designed to be a new, quick and convenient way for parents to get help for common challenging situations,\u201d A/Prof Westrupp explains.\n\n\u201cTwice a day, parents get prompted to answer a few short questions, which they can answer when it suits them. We ask things like whether the parent themself is feeling upset and how difficult it is managing their child\u2019s emotions and behaviour right in that moment. It only takes about five seconds but their responses help us to tailor the parenting tips so that they\u2019re relevant to each family.\u201d\n\nEvidence-based wellbeing\n\nThe app is built on three trusted wellbeing practices \u2014 emotional support, play, and connection to nature and culture \u2014 in order to nourish a child\u2019s overall wellbeing.\n\nThrough a collaboration with Wayapa Wuurrk, Daily Growth families have access to resources to help support their children\u2019s mental health through an Indigenous Earth mindfulness practice.\n\n\u201cChildren are so connected to and learn constantly from their environments. They are also curious about the world around them and their place within it,\u201d says Wayapa Wuurrk training manager and cultural lead Jem Stone.\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunity to connect with the Earth through the Wayapa lens, children and parents can foster a lifestyle of Earth-centred wellbeing. We all want to experience a sense of belonging and inclusion, and Wayapa helps us all acknowledge the various ways that we can attune ourselves to each other and the natural environment.\u201d\n\nWayapa teaches children about the natural cycles of the Earth. Credit: iStock\n\nWayapa teaches children about the natural cycles of the Earth. For example, in the context of bedtime routines, when the sun is setting, you would say that the world is getting ready for rest. You might invite your child to say goodnight to the sun and welcome the moon that looks over them as they sleep.\n\nSimilarly, when a child is getting dressed, you can encourage them to look outside and see what kind of weather is outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all too easy to look at our smartphone and see the weather predictions,\u201d Stone explains. \u201cBut teaching our child to observe the natural world around them encourages them to feel connected to and supported by the Earth.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to play, A/Prof Westrupp says that not only does it help children connect to their bodies and have fun, but explains that there is scientific evidence showing that physical activity and play also help manage stress and promote brain development.\n\nFrom big, slow movements and games involving rhythm, music and dance, to the energy of rough-and-tumble games, they each play a positive role in a child\u2019s mental wellness.\n\nMeanwhile, to support parents in teaching their child about emotions, A/Prof Westrupp shares these six steps that adults can always refer to as a simple and quick go-to to help their child with their emotions.\n\nPause, notice your own emotions and take five deep breaths. It\u2019s hard to support your child if you\u2019re emotional yourself. Notice what your child might be feeling and why, and think about how you can meet their needs. Accept. You teach your child that emotions are normal and safe when you calmly accept all their emotions, even the uncomfortable ones. Listen and label. If your child is emotional or really upset, it\u2019s best not to say much in the moment. Instead, listen and label your child\u2019s emotions with simple language to help them feel understood. Empathise. Empathising with your child helps to build trust, and strengthens the connection between you. Reflect. Kids learn to understand themselves when they talk about things later when everyone\u2019s calm. You can problem-solve together, and role model how to share your feelings, take responsibility and make amends for behaviour you regret.\n\n\n\nGrowing our children\u2019s mental wellbeing\u2026 together\n\nEach family is unique, and Daily Growth has been designed for all Australian families.

    "text": "It was meant to be a 'fresh start' for this young couple, but just four days into their trip, the journey turned into a nightmare.\n\nA South Australian couple have been left with just the clothes on their backs after losing everything in a caravan fire on the Eyre Peninsula. Source: GFM\n\nA young Australian couple\u2019s dream road trip, which was meant to be a \"fresh start\" for the pair, has ended in disaster after their caravan was completely destroyed in a fire just days into their journey.\n\nIsabelle and her partner Dave had been on the road for only four days when their holiday took a heartbreaking turn at a popular camping spot on South Australia\u2019s Eyre Peninsula. \"We had spent months planning our dream trip, and only a few days in, disaster struck,\" Isabelle said.\n\nThe 28-year-old content creator was helping her partner reverse the caravan into place when she suddenly noticed plumes of smoke billowing out.\n\n\"While reversing the van, I got out to help direct and ... heard the fire alarm. I saw thick smoke pouring out of the vent above the caravan front door,\" she recalled. Acting fast, Isabelle rushed to unhook their car and evacuate their three dogs \u2014 Lucy, Buddy and Axel \u2014 while Dave attempted to fight the flames.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"My partner [used an] extinguisher, but it was too late. The smoke was overwhelming, and it was too dangerous to be inside the van with no visibility,\" she said, describing the moment in a GoFundMe campaign in the wake of the freak accident.\n\n\"We managed to remove the gas bottles before calling 000, but all we could do was watch as everything we owned burned to the ground.\"\n\nAll that was left of the caravan were charred remains. Source: GFM\n\nImmeasurable loss as couple left with just charred remains\n\nThe pair were able to save the dogs, which Isabelle said is \"what truly matters\".\n\n\"But the loss is absolutely devastating. We\u2019re still in shock, struggling to process that everything we owned is just gone in an instant,\" she said. Although they escaped unharmed, the ordeal has been crushing.\n\n\"The dogs were really scared,\" she told The Adelaide Advertiser. \"It was pretty hard to watch, they were shaking heaps.\"\n\nIsabelle and parter Dave were just four days into their trip of a lifetime when disaster struck. Source: GFM\n\nWhile the caravan was insured, their policy only covers $1,000 worth of contents, far less than the $25,000 worth of belongings they said they lost. Among the items included cameras, a drone, a Starlink satellite, jewellery, passports, fishing and surf gear, kitchen appliances, clothing and sentimental belongings. The couple spent hours searching through the debris, but the only distinguishable items were a burnt passport and a Valentine\u2019s Day photo album.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe tragedy has been especially difficult given the couple\u2019s recent struggles. Before embarking on their trip, they said they had lost their business \"due to non-payment from an interstate company\". Despite winning a lengthy legal battle, they received nothing when the company was found to have no assets to liquidate.\n\nThe couple and their three dogs escaped unscathed, but lost everything they owned. Source: GFM\n\nThe young Australians estimate the contents inside were worth a total of $25,000. Source: GFM\n\n\"This trip was meant to be a fresh start for us,\" the couple said. \"We chose to turn that hardship into something positive by embarking on a trip in our caravan, only for this to happen.\"\n\nNow, they are seeking help to rebuild their lives through the online fundraiser.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We are hoping to raise funds to help replace some of what was lost. We went to Kmart to purchase some clothes and toiletries as we were literally left with what was on our backs. We have booked an Airbnb for a few days to figure out our next steps, and while we await advice from the insurance company. Any support \u2014 whether donating or sharing \u2014 means the world to us,\" Isabelle said.\n\nDespite everything, they are holding onto what truly matters. \"We\u2019re staying strong and grateful that we and our pups are safe,\" she said.\n\nCaravanners warned after multiple dangerous blazes\n\nEarlier this month in South Australia, another family lost their $175,000 caravan in a blaze at the Auburn Community Caravan Park, after lithium-ion batteries inside caught fire.\n\nSA's Country Fire Service said the occupants spotted smoke \"coming out of the batteries\" before the fire had started. They were able to exit the vehicle safely but it was too late for the caravan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTypically, caravans use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePo) batteries rather than lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries because LiFePo is better suited for the demands of caravan power systems.\n\nStandard lithium-ion batteries are slightly lighter and more energy-dense, which is why they\u2019re used in smartphones and laptops. But as many people pointed out, there are a range of reasons why caravanners might use lithium-ion batteries \u2014 including to charge e-mobility devices \u2014 but doing so unattended is generally discouraged.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
