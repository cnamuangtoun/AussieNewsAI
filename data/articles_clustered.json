    "text": "The superannuation industry has apologised for systemic failures that left Australians grieving the death of a loved one with added distress.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) released its landmark death benefit claims handling report today which investigated 10 trustees \u2014 Australian Retirement Trust, Avanteos, Brighter Super, Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, HESTA, Hostplus, NM Super, Nulis, Rest and UniSuper \u2014 over the two years to March 31, 2024.\n\nIt found that none of the trustees, which together represent 38 per cent of all member benefits in super, monitored or reported on their end-to-end times for handling claims or performance.\n\nRear view of casually clothed senior couple going over paperwork at home (Getty)\n\nThe report also identified that 78 per cent of claims that were reviewed in the two-year period were delayed due to processing issues within the trustees' control, with members living in First Nations postcodes experiencing even greater delays. \ufeff\n\nOf those claims, 27 per cent were met with poor customer service including phone calls not being returned, queries dismissed and claimants asked for unreasonable information.\n\n\"Many of the complaints we read were distressing. We saw deep grief, vulnerability, frustration and genuine suffering,\" ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said.\n\nIn one case, a trustee took more than 500 days to pay a $100,000 death benefit to a woman grieving the loss of her husband but still has not received the payment.\n\nThe report found the trustee had failed to respond to her concerns about financial hardship and did not support her when she struggled to navigate the claims process. \ufeff\n\nASIC Chair Joe Longo and ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant. (Louie Douvis)\n\nIn another instance, a wife whose husband of more than 20 years had died from cancer, received the $600,000 death benefit payment three weeks later than she should have.\n\nShe also faced poor customer service after several months of frustrating interactions, including when it took two months and two follow-ups to receive a response to a query.\n\nASIC called on the super industry to immediately review and address \ufeffdeath benefit claims handling deficiencies by adopting its 34 recommendations, including streamlined processes and procedures, better guidance and training for staff and removing barriers for First Nations members.\n\n\"Grieving Australians should not have to suffer further stress because of the failure of superannuation trustees to approach claims in a timely, clear, and respectful manner,\" Constant said.\n\n\"At the heart of this issue is leadership that doesn't have a grip on the fund's data, systems and processes \u2014 and ultimately it is the customers who suffer for it,\" ASIC chair Joe Longo added.\n\n\"This kind of disconnect is unacceptable in any area of corporate Australia, but in the superannuation sector it is particularly serious, because super affects everyone from the boardroom to the living room.\"\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) has welcomed the report and apologised for the problems plaguing the sector.\n\n\"The superannuation sector knows we have let down some of our members and their families at a time when they needed us, and we are sorry,\" ASFA chief executive Mary Delahunty said.\n\n\"As a sector, we are committed to keep working until we get it right.\"",

    "text": "The Labor and Liberal leaders are both playing coy on how much their energy policies will cut power prices \u2014 if at all \u2014 as campaigning on the cost of living continues.\n\nElectricity costs soared early in Labor's term, as the outbreak of war in Ukraine and a global reordering of energy supply forced up power prices.\n\nIt also thwarted a promise Labor made at the last campaign that its plans to ramp up wind and solar power would cut power bills by $275 \u2014 a failed promise the Coalition has not been shy in reminding people.\n\nLabor maintains electricity bills are several hundred dollars cheaper than they would have been without the government's interventions and bill rebates.\n\nBut Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is distancing himself from the original RepuTex modelling that predicted power prices would fall by $275 by 2025, with the government previously arguing that the world had experienced the biggest energy crisis since the 1970s in the period since it was commissioned.\n\nAsked in 2022 whether he thought the price promise was achievable, Mr Albanese responded: \"I don't think, I know. I know because we have done the modelling.\"\n\nThat modelling also predicted prices to be $378 lower by 2030 \u2014 which Labor is not holding itself to, saying more recent forecasts by the Australian Energy Market Operator and others are more robust.\n\nAsked about that modelling again today, Mr Albanese kept it at arm's length.\n\n\"Our energy policy offering is all out there. RepuTex modelling was RepuTex modelling that they put out,\" he said today.\n\nModelling wars\n\nIn the Coalition camp, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is also facing questions on the details of his promise to force the gas giants to divert more supply into the domestic market.\n\nMr Dutton says modelling by Frontier Economics for its gas plan says adding an extra 50 to 100 petajoules into the domestic market (roughly a 20 per cent increase) would reduce the wholesale price from $14 to $10 a gigajoule \u2014 and that would flow onto consumers and businesses.\n\nThat modelling has not yet been released.\n\nIn the absence of it, Mr Dutton has not spelled out exactly by how much or when he expects his gas reservation plan to bring down prices, insisting there will be more detail available once the modelling is published.\n\nThe opposition leader insists \"it will deliver lower gas and electricity prices\", though it is unclear whether that will be in comparison to current prices, or what power prices would otherwise be projected to be.\n\n\"We're not going to make the same mistake that Anthony Albanese did before the last election,\" Coalition campaign spokesman James Paterson said on Sunday.\n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen said the Coalition was trying to \"hide\" the true cost of its plan to build a domestic nuclear industry.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about a plan that is riddled with fundamental errors. Their so-called modelling is a con,\" Mr Bowen said.\n\n\"His supposed gas 'plan' is nothing but an attempt to distract from [nuclear].\"\n\nWhat's happening with prices?\n\nThe energy regulator recently announced benchmark power prices would increase by between 5 and 9 per cent for some households on Australia's east coast and in South Australia from July.\n\nThose price increases will only affect about a tenth of customers directly, who are not on more competitive arrangements \u2014 but it also sets a price direction for the energy retailers.\n\nAre energy retailers profiteering? Profit results from AGL and Origin have prompted calls for more to be done to reduce electricity and gas prices.\n\nLabor is promising a one-off extension to power rebates of $150 that will be delivered over two instalments in the back half of this year.\n\nThose rebates, which would be the third tranche offered by under Mr Albanese, have helped to artificially suppress electricity prices and their full impact on inflation.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics in December estimated without those and similar state rebates, electricity prices would be more than 40 per cent higher than they are today.\n\nThe Australian Energy Market Commission late last year suggested residential prices could be around 13 per cent lower in a decade \"if renewable and energy and infrastructure development proceeds as expected\".\n\nBut with nothing to replace the Commonwealth rebate at the end of this year, household energy bills would be expected to rise again.",

Directed by: Will Howarth, Tom McKeith Starring: Talia Zucker, Ashley Zukerman, Will Howarth When: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: On the edge of your seat\n\nSet in an unspecified future where there are no insects or birdsong, the new Australian ecological thriller catapults us into a world where environmental disasters have wreaked havoc on livestock production, among other things.\n\nExperimenting with animal cloning biotechnology on an isolated cattle property, husband-wife duo Jack (Ashley Zukerman of Succession and Apple Cider Vinegar fame) and Layla (the film's co-writer Zucker and Lake Mungo lead) are facing issues in their production line \u2014 all of which are compounded by the sudden incursion of an unexplained presence on their property.\n\nCo-writer and co-director Will Howarth (who also plays a farmhand named Brady) says the sci-fi aspect of the film came about organically.\n\n\"Whether it's sci-fi or horror or a psychological thriller, I like it when a big concept is representative of something else,\" he says.\n\n\"Climate change and ecological collapse certainly informed the setting, the breakdown of the outside world and the isolated experience Jack and Layla have, but it wasn't something we set out to make a film about. These themes came naturally into it, and we thought they'd be interesting to explore.\"\n\nLayla (Zucker) is isolated on the remote farm and kept in the dark by her husband. (Supplied: Madman)\n\nPolymathic trio Howarth, Zucker and Tom McKeith, have crafted an unsettling, tense tale of mistruths and betrayal set in a world that looks familiar but holds portents of danger.\n\nPartners in real-life, as well as in their creative pursuits, Zucker and Howarth started working on the idea when they were living together in LA. The film was developed through the Sundance Screenwriters Lab, supported by Screen Australia and Screen NSW, and has already picked up an accolade in the form of the prestigious Dark Matters Jury Award at the Austin Film Festival.\n\n\"Tom, Will and I worked together for such a long time on the script and we did so much development work together,\" Zucker says.\n\n\"We workshopped every scene in the film, acted them out to see if they worked, and pre-shot the entire film on our iPhones just to see if the scenes were working as we hoped.\"\n\nBut the execution of Zucker's original idea \u2014 which initially took its inspiration from taut, contained psychological thrillers like Ex Machina \u2014 looks very different to its previous form.\n\n\"The original story was told from the male perspective,\" Zucker says. \"It was quite a different feeling. And then one of us had the idea to flip the perspective and tell it from Layla's point of view, which is when it started to feel like a thriller \u2014 more tense and much scarier.\n\n\"Because Layla doesn't know what's going on, the genre element of the film started to become more apparent as we developed the story further and told it from her perspective.\"\n\nAustralian-American actor Ashley Zukerman is the lead in this film, after starring as Clive in Apple Cider Vinegar and Nate in Succession. (Supplied: Madman)\n\nZukerman was always who the trio had in mind for the subtly menacing and inscrutable character of Jack.\n\n\"Ash had his own take on Jack and brought this quiet intensity that I wasn't expecting,\" Howarth says.\n\n\"There are certain points in the film \u2014 and this isn't a huge spoiler \u2014 where Jack isn't telling the truth to his wife. I remember shooting these scenes and getting lost. Ash, in his portrayal of Jack, was so convincing when he was lying to his wife that we couldn't even tell if he was telling the truth or not.\"\n\nA different take on Australian apocalypse\n\nUsing old-timey technology in a futuristic setting, the production values of In Vitro have a touch of Severance to them \u2014 enhanced by the aesthetic vision of sound designer Matt Perrott and production designer Alexi Wilson.\n\n\"Matt had to carefully strip out every bird chirp and every insect sound to make the landscape feel dead. His approach to how the technology in the movie sounded was to go as far back as he could go,\" Howarth says.\n\n\"And then Alexi had such a good idea about the vehicles on-set. She was like, 'What if it looks like everyone's driving old utes, but they're actually EVs?'\"\n\nAlthough an ecological thriller, the state of the relationship between Jack and Layla makes up a lot of the tension in this film. (Supplied: Madman)\n\nThe desolation of Jack and Layla's existence is set against the breathtakingly beautiful backdrops of Cooma in the Snowy Monaro region of New South Wales and Goulburn, adroitly captured under the eye of cinematographer Shelley Farthing-Dawe.\n\nHowarth says the gothic elements of the landscape \u2014 the dead trees, the vast open plains \u2014 complemented the horror undertones of the film.\n\n\"The reason we shot in these locations is because we didn't want the film to feel like other Australian apocalyptic future worlds that we've seen before; that burnt red dirt, burnt out sky look that's famous from other films like Wake in Fright or Mad Max.\n\n\"We wanted to do something that felt like it could be anywhere in the world. And we also wanted the landscape to feel uneasy and inherently eerie; it's an unfamiliar version of Australia.\"\n\nNew cloning techniques are used to supply meat \"for a growing population, still hungry for the real thing\". (Supplied: Madman)\n\nFittingly for the film, Zucker recalls shooting it in the summer of 2022 amid the most tumultuous weather, which they tried to bring into the final edit.\n\nZucker and Howarth say they hope to wear fewer hats on their next film project, but they can't wait to see what Australian film-goers think of their debut feature effort: a sci-fi film that joins the pantheon of crime thrillers and horrors Australia is especially known for.\n\n\"In the last few years, there's been so many interesting films being made in this lower-budget range and it would be great if that continued to happen,\" says Zucker.\n\nHowarth agrees that the future of filmmaking in Australia is exciting.\n\n\"We want to keep making films in Australia. We moved back from the US to do just that.\"",

(Instagram: Chuck Norris)\n\nNorton was also a mainstay in the Hong Kong action scene, appearing in such films as Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars and Millionaire's Express, opposite icon Sammo Hung.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Norris said he was heartbroken by the loss of his \"friend and brother\".\n\n\"The wonderful memories we shared will forever be cherished in my heart,\" he said.\n\n\" Richard, you made me not only a better martial artist but a better person. \"\n\nIn recent years Norton passed on his martial arts knowledge to a range of modern movie stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith on 2016's Suicide Squad and Charlize Theron for Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015, where he also had a brief role as the Prime Imperator.\n\nNorton also had an impact on a smaller scale, taking part in a fundraising event in 2017 for a family who lost a father to suicide.\n\nA pair of sais \u2014 small forked swords \u2014 used by Norton in a fight against Norris in The Octagon pulled in more than $3,500 for the auction, which raised more than $15,000 for the man's wife and two children.",

(ABC News)\n\nThe small town of Monto, almost 500 kilometres north of Brisbane, is the halfway point on the trail.\n\nOnce known for its dairy industry, the town of just 1,100 people, has already seen a boost from rail trail tourism and just a quarter of the track is operational.\n\nThe traditional tourism season has extended to 10 months from February to November as visitors are drawn to the region to explore the rail trail, said Melinda Jones, the North Burnett deputy mayor and BIEDO vice president.\n\n\"The tourism season has increased, and also the number of visitors has increased with the opening of the rail trail, with also the art trail work that's been going on as well,\" Ms Jones said.\n\nMelinda Jones says the tourism season in Monto is running for longer.

(ABC Wide Bay: Nikki Sorbello)\n\nMs Jones said the benefits of the rail trail will continue as more sections of the corridor are connected.\n\nShe said they hoped the entire trail would be opened within five to 10 years.\n\nIn Queensland, rail corridors are managed under a perpetual lease by the Department of Transport and Main Roads which also offers financial support for projects, trail development and annual maintenance.\n\nThree sections of the Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail have been opened. (ABC Wide Bay: Nikki Sorbello)\n\nBBIRT president Desley O'Grady said completing the trail was reliant on volunteers and funding.\n\n\"We've got champions along the way in each of the towns that support the trail and tell us what they need in their section,\" Ms O'Grady said.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nJennifer and Kevin Roth put their love of cycling into opening their \"retirement\" business, offering tours and supported rides on the BBIRT.\n\n\"We haven't had a lot of international visitors, but they are starting to hear about us and they are starting to make moves to start planning trips,\" Ms Roth said.\n\n\"It's not just about us, it's about the entire region working together to create just an enormous tourism potential.\"\n\nMs Roth said it would revitalise smaller communities across the length of the ride.\n\nThe Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail, when fully connected, will be the longest rail trail in the Southern Hemisphere at 271km. (ABC Wide Bay: Nikki Sorbello)\n\n\"Those smaller towns probably have the most to gain, where at the moment there are a cluster of houses, but in time to come there could be a general store and a cafe and accommodation,\" she said.\n\n\" There's going to be huge openings for people to think outside the box of what they might have, and what they can bring to the trail too. \"\n\nEconomic opportunity\n\nAdventure-based tourism is an area of growth and opportunity says Vikki Schaffer, a senior lecturer in School of Business and Creative Industries at the University of Sunshine Coast.\n\nVikki Schaffer says tourists are looking for a meaningful adventure. (Supplied: University of Sunshine Coast)\n\n\"A lot of adventure tourism visitors are looking for something that's meaningful, that's authentic, that gives them the opportunity to have self-actualisation, to be able to say, 'I did that, I participated in that particular activity',\" she said.\n\nDr Schaffer said estimated economic values of rail trails varied from $50 to $483 a day depending on what was on offer along the rail trail.\n\nTourism numbers and the tourism season are increasing as the rail trail becomes more popular. (ABC Wide Bay: Nikki Sorbello)\n\nBut aside from the economic value, Dr Schaffer said there was an opportunity for regenerative tourism.\n\n\"A lot of these rail tails have adjoining areas they pass through that are key for flora and fauna,\" she said.\n\n\"So here's an opportunity to conserve and preserve unique environments that run parallel with rail trails as well.\"",

    "text": "Workers in the racing industry across Australia say horses are being routinely drugged for track work at the peril of rider and horse safety in a malpractice which could breach nationwide racing rules.\n\nThe ABC has spoken to a number of people who worked in the industry in New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria, and the ACT who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThese workers say some horse trainers across the country are giving their horses tranquillisers on an almost daily basis, including a substance called acepromazine, as a quick safety fix for training and as a cost-cutting measure.\n\nRacing Australia chief executive Paul Eriksson said the organisation had \"recently become aware\" of the use of acepromazine for track work.\n\nHe said the authority had begun collecting data about the practice, but it had not been made aware of any complaints or concerns.\n\nSimply referred to as \"ace\", the prescription medicine can be administered by oral gel or injection and is advertised as a way to calm an excitable or nervous horse that may be hard to handle during transport or veterinary procedures.\n\nDirections for an acepromazine product in United Kingdom are clear \u2014 \"do not, in any circumstances, ride horses within the 36 hours following administration of the product\".\n\nBut according to workers in Australia's industry the pharmaceutical is being abused by some horse trainers, risking the safety of riders, handlers, and the horse itself.\n\n'Disaster waiting to happen'\n\nOne worker, who previously worked in regional Victoria, said she held grave concerns for the safety of riders on drugged horses as the animal was more likely to trip and fall.\n\n\"It's just a disaster waiting to happen,\" she said.\n\nThis worker said she was tasked with administering the drug to horses, which she said was common practice in the industry.\n\nThe ABC has viewed work sheets that show horses being routinely sedated before track work at that regional Victorian stable.\n\nSome workers say racehorses aren't adequately trained, meaning trainers resort to drugging their horses. (AAP)\n\nAnother worker, also from regional Victoria, said drugging horses for track work should be banned.\n\n\"If a horse needs to be sedated to go out on the track then it shouldn't be out there,\" she said.\n\n\"It's too risky for the horse, the rider, and anyone else out on the track at the time.\"\n\nOne worker, who had been a track rider for two decades throughout New South Wales and the ACT, told the ABC she rode many sedated horses during her time in the industry.\n\n\"I've ridden horses that are nearly going to fall over with every stride, which is terrifying,\" she said.\n\n\"You can feel they've had too much [acepromazine] in them.\n\n\" You're riding a compromised horse. It just takes one trip for a horse to come down and kill a rider. \"\n\nShe said some trainers would automatically give ace to their horses under the belief it made the horses easier to handle and ride, with some riders refusing to get on a horse that had not been drugged.\n\nBut she disagreed with the approach saying it masked \"the underlying problem\" that horses were broken in too young and not adequately trained, leaving them akin to a car with \"no steering [and] no brakes\".\n\nShe said ace was commonly used on Monday mornings after the horses were confined to their stalls all day Sunday without being let out for exercise and still being fed a high-energy diet.\n\n\"By Monday morning they're off their head,\" she said.\n\nDrug use could breach racing rules\n\nThe Australian Veterinary Association guidelines state acepromazine is classed as a regulated medicine that can only be prescribed by a vet for a specific treatment.\n\nThe drug should be stored in a secure place where only authorised persons can access it and records kept on how and when it was administered, the guidelines said.\n\nIt said sedatives for uses such as shoeing and dentistry should only be dispensed for use in horses under the care of the prescribing veterinarian and in doses suitable for the immediate need.\n\nIt also listed horse-breaking as a potential use for the substance.\n\n\"Hazards of sedation to the horse and operator should be explained,\" the guidelines said.\n\nSedatives like acepromazine are a regulated medicine. (ABC Rural: Kim Honan)\n\nEquine Veterinarians Australia president Laura Hardefeldt said the organisation supported vets in prescribing the medication in accordance with racing regulations and veterinary prescribing laws in their respective jurisdiction.\n\n\"Veterinarians are best positioned to work with owners and trainers to make informed decisions in the best interest of each horse and its rider,\" Dr Hardefeldt said.\n\nMr Eriksson said Racing Australia was collecting data across the country through each state's racing body's chief veterinary officer to \"understand whether the practice is prevalent and the processes involved in the administration of acepromazine\".\n\nHe said the use of sedatives in horses, prescribed by a vet for veterinary purposes, was not necessarily a safety risk.\n\n\"Under the rules of racing a horse cannot be presented to compete in a race or official trial with acepromazine or any other sedative present as it falls under the list of prohibited substances in those circumstances,\" Mr Eriksson said.\n\n\"If acepromazine was not prescribed by a veterinarian, and its use not in accordance with a veterinarian's instructions and/or not appropriately recorded, then that would, prima facie, breach the Australian Rules of Racing,\" he said.\n\nLack of horse and rider training\n\nOne track rider who worked in Western Australia for three decades said the wide use of acepromazine had become more common in recent years due to the high rate of employee turnover in the industry, and the lack of time and expertise put into training horses.\n\n\"It's really, really common. I know of stables over here where every single horse is sedated every single day,\" the track rider said.\n\nShe said it was expensive for stables to hire competent riders who could train horses and that backpackers with no prior experience riding horses were often hired to work in stables.\n\nShe said racehorses were often broken in, or trained to be ridden, during a two-week period, compared to other equine pursuits where horses received basic handling and riding training over a period of months or years.\n\n\"There such a rush to get a horse broken in and into the races,\" she said.\n\nAn insider says restricting the use of tranquillisers like acepromazine would cause mayhem in the industry. (ABC Rural: Lydia Burton, file photo)\n\nShe said bolting, rearing, or other problematic behaviour was due to the horse being fearful or inadequately trained.\n\n\"The horse isn't misbehaving, it's expressing itself as a horse. A horse will only do what it feels it needs to do to survive,\" she said.\n\n\"They've got hundreds of thousands of years of evolution behind them that says that they need to move about 30 kilometres a day, grazing the entire time.\n\n\"We lock them up in a stable for 23 hours a day and then expect them to behave at the moment they walk out the door.\"\n\nShe said restricting the use of tranquillisers like acepromazine would cause mayhem in the industry because it had become too reliant on the use of the substances.\n\n\"It's considered a routine part of training,\" she said.\n\n\" You would have a lot of upset trainers. You would have a lot of injured people and you'd have no workers. \"\n\nShe said a better understanding of equine psychology was needed in the industry.\n\nThe worker said horses kept in paddocks rather than stables were less likely to be given sedatives.\n\n\"These horses are in a paddock the entire time. They can have a run around and buck and roll and play as they need to get rid of the excess energy,\" she said.\n\nShe said racehorses needed better welfare conditions, including light exercise in the morning and afternoons, as well as feeding on more hay and less grain.\n\nMore regulations needed\n\nProfessor Paul McGreevy of the Sydney School of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney said the practice stemmed from the way racehorses were kept in confinement.\n\n\"You've got this animal that's been bred to run [and] what we're seeing is an inability to handle, lead, and ride these horses safely,\" he said.\n\n\" The way that horses are managed creates this apparent need for tranquillisation. \"\n\nHe said regulation is needed on vets administering the product.\n\n\"The sustainability of racing depends on improving horse welfare as much as possible and a bandaid solution is not the answer,\" Professor McGreevy said.\n\nHelle Erhardsen of the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses called for the practice to be outlawed, in addition to strengthening welfare regulations, including keeping horses in an open paddock with other horses.\n\n\"Let the horses live like horses. Don't set them up to become a ticking time bomb. You would not need to sedate them at all,\" Ms Erhardsen said.",

(Supplied)\n\nSwinburne PhD student and MCRI researcher in transgender health, Charlotte Blacklock, says the scale has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of positive gender-related experiences.\n\n\"There is growing recognition of the need to broaden understandings of gender diversity by exploring and highlighting the joyful aspects of trans people's lives,\" she says.\n\n\"We have created the first ever scale to assess gender euphoria, a concept that arose from within the trans community to describe positive feelings associated with being trans.\"\n\nCo-author of the study Dr Simone Buzwell from Swinburne says the scale could be used to improve mental health treatment for the TGD community by focusing on how to help people experience gender euphoria.\n\n\"The gender euphoria scale could be used to help clinicians focus on assisting clients to experience positive aspects of gender identity, rather than focusing on eliminating gender dysphoria,\" she says.\n\nPsychologist and study co-author Simone Buzwell.\n\nTara believes the scale will also allow advocacy groups, like Transcend, to better support TGD people.\n\n\"By understanding what drives gender euphoria, we can advocate for policies and services that maximise these affirming experiences, ensuring that TGD individuals can thrive, rather than just survive,\" she says.\n\nWhy this matters now more than ever\n\nThe recent decision from Queensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls to deny access to hormone treatment for new trans and gender-diverse patients under 18 serves as a stark reminder of the power governments wield over TGD people's ability to experience gender euphoria.\n\nThe controversial decision triggered a nationwide day of protests and forced federal Health Minister Mark Butler to announce a review of the national standards of care and treatment guidelines for TGD children and adolescents.\n\nMax also knows the positive impact government decisions can have on everyday lives: last year, the New South Wales parliament passed a bill allowing TGD people to change the gender on their birth certificates without undergoing surgery.\n\n\"When [the Equality Bill] passed that allowed me to update my ID documents \u2026 I felt gender euphoria. I felt it pass through me like a wave from the whole trans community, like we could all breathe collectively.\n\n\"[It's a very] human experience that we are after,\" they say. \"A feeling of belonging to ourselves.\n\nThe need for a positive approach to trans and gender-diverse identities\n\nTGD people experience disproportionately high rates of mental ill health, self-harm, and suicide due to a range of factors including discrimination, vilification, gender dysphoria, and being ostracised from social support networks.\n\nDespite the seriousness of these challenges, trans advocates say it is essential to also focus on the positive aspects of being TGD.\n\n\"Recognising and measuring gender euphoria is essential in shifting the narrative away from solely focusing on challenges and the impacts of discrimination and vilification, and instead highlighting these positive markers of wellbeing and the life-affirming aspects of trans experiences,\" says Tara.\n\n\"For too long, research and public discourse have centred around the challenges and distress associated with being trans, often reinforcing a deficit-based perspective.\"\n\nWhile it's important to address issues like discrimination and dysphoria, she says a strengths-based approach is more empowering.\n\n\"It shifts the focus to what is working, what brings joy, and what enhances wellbeing.\n\n\"This research is an important step in recognising that trans experiences are not just about overcoming challenges, but also about thriving, celebrating identity, and feeling affirmed.\"\n\nThe hope is that the scale will become widely adopted by clinicians, researchers and policymakers to reframe the way trans healthcare and wellbeing is approached.\n\nMax embraces two other members of the trans and gender-diverse community.\n\nThe need for a more positive approach to trans identity is echoed by Max.\n\n\"Trans people, especially young trans people, need to see images and experiences of other trans people in a state of joy, in a state of peace,\" they say.\n\n\"The trans people I know who regularly experience gender euphoria are some of the most open-hearted, kind, contributing, and brave people I know.\n\n\"It's not just the trans community who need people like that. The world needs people like that right now.\"",

    "text": "Hi, over the next five weeks, I\u2019ll be blogging about the seat of Wills as the 2025 federal election unfolds.\n\nI\u2019m normally an investigative reporter for The Age \u2013 investigative reporters never miss an opportunity to push their stories, so please read my most recent reporting on Australia\u2019s $4 billion cosmetic injectables industry here. But during the federal election, I\u2019ll follow full-time Labor MP Peter Khalil, the Greens\u2019 Samantha Ratnam, Liberal Jeff Kidney, Socialist Sue Bolton, and all of the other candidates in this northern suburbs seat.\n\nVictorian Labor MP Peter Khalil. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nWills covers progressive northern suburbs like Brunswick and Coburg and Labor-leaning areas like Pascoe Vale, Fawkner, Oak Park and Glenroy. But a redistribution has added some of Australia\u2019s most green booths \u2014 in North Fitzroy and North Carlton \u2014 to Wills for the first time.\n\nThis will likely hand Ratnam and the Greens an advantage. However, as I moved around the seat in the last week, preparing for the launch of this blog today, I noticed plenty of Peter Khalil signs on house fences in both North Carlton and North Fitzroy. Maybe that advantage, like so many Greens predictions of victory here, will be an illusion again: it\u2019s been a phenomenon in this seat for more than a decade that the Greens talk up their chance of snatching Wills from Labor and then ultimately a win fails to materialise.\n\nAt the 2022 election, I spent six fascinating weeks in the seat of Chisholm, roaming its suburbs which include Box Hill, Burwood, Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley. There, it was clear a few weeks out that Liberal MP Gladys Liu would struggle to hold the seat from Labor\u2019s Carina Garland. Ultimately, Garland won easily with a 7 per cent swing to her and Labor. So far in Wills, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the Greens\u2019 talk of this being a potential win is just that \u2013 talk \u2013 or if the voters of this economically and ethnically diverse seat will finally turn out for them. Or will they back Khalil and the status quo? Ratnam has stood in Wills against Khalil before, in 2016. Then, she came close to ending the party\u2019s near-continuous hold on the seat since its creation in 1949. Ratnam secured 45 per cent of the vote that year. Khalil ultimately won but had to rely on preferences from other parties. Since then, no Greens candidate has come near Khalil, who has expanded his majority in the seat on a two-party preferred basis to 9 per cent.\n\nLoading\n\nKhalil, 52, was born in Melbourne to Egyptian parents and grew up in public housing. Ratnam, 47 and born to Sri Lankan parents who left that country because of civil war, is a strong candidate in her own right. In the nine years since she last ran, Ratnam\u2019s profile has grown and grown \u2013 first as the mayor of Moreland (now Merri-bek) Council, and then as the state leader of the Greens in Victoria. Wills, famously represented by former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke from 1980 until his retirement in 1992, is named after William John Wills who, alongside Robert O\u2019Hara Burke, perished on their ill-fated expedition from Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nAt the centre of Wills is Bell Street, the major arterial road which once acted as the so-called hipster proof fence in previous elections, with Labor voters to the north and Greens voters to the south. But rising house prices punched a hole in that fence, with younger, Greens-voting progressives increasingly settling in suburbs such as Pascoe Vale and Coburg North. The big issues here, like everywhere in Australia right now, are housing, the cost of living, health policy and particularly whether people can afford it.\n\nBut the vicious politics over Israel and Palestine is the really significant factor in this suburb \u2013 just like it is in many of Sydney\u2019s most ethnically diverse seats. Ten per cent of Wills was Muslim at the 2021 Census, so Palestine is sure to be a big focus. The first time I chatted to both of the campaign teams for either side, they talked up what I can only assume is their hoped-for outcome on this issue. Labor argues Israel-Palestine is of vastly less importance to most voters in this seat than the more mainstream issues like health and the cost of living. The Greens say Israel-Palestine is the first thing many residents talk about when Ratnam and her team doorknock homes here. So we will see.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an exciting five weeks. Please send any tips you\u2019ve got relating to this seat, to any of the candidates, or really anything a voter in Wills might be interested in, to my email, clucas@theage.com.au, my Proton mail, claylucas@protonmail.com, or via Signal on +61439828128. This really will be one of the most fascinating battles in Australian politics in 2025 \u2013 I hope you will follow it with me.",

    "text": "The employees who received lay-off notices were told they should go home that afternoon. Some had been co-ordinating with aid missions in Bangkok, the Thai capital, and Manila, capital of the Philippines, which handle disaster response in Asia. Two of the employees in Washington had expected to move this winter to Yangon, in Myanmar, and to Bangkok to work as humanitarian assistance advisers out of the US missions there. But those positions were cut. Had they not been, the two employees would have been on the ground to organise urgent responses to the earthquake. After the disaster hit on Friday, the US embassy in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, sent a cable to USAID headquarters in Washington to start the process of evaluating aid needs and getting help out the door. And the next day, a Trump administration political appointee in USAID, Tim Meisburger, held a call with officials from national security agencies to discuss a plan. But Meisburger said that while there would be a response, no one should expect the agency\u2019s capabilities to be what they were in the past, a person with direct knowledge of the call said.\n\nA USAID spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment. The agency typically has access to food and emergency supplies in warehouses in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Subang Jaya, Malaysia. But the big question now is how quickly, after being almost fully dismantled, it can get goods from those places into Myanmar. The goods include medical kits that can each serve the healthcare needs of 30,000 people for more than three months. Russian search-and-rescue teams with their dogs in Myanmar. Credit: Russia Emergency Ministry press service via AP Apart from career diplomats, the ranks of the agency\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance have included crisis specialist contractors who live around the world and can deploy quickly in what are called Disaster Assistance Response Teams. Many of those contractors have been fired, and the infrastructure to support them in Washington and other offices \u2013 people who can book flights and manage payments, for instance \u2013 was crippled by cuts over the past two months. The agency would also usually put certified search-and-rescue teams in Virginia and Southern California on alert for possible deployment to the disaster zone, but transportation contracts for those teams had been cut, a former aid agency employee said.\n\nUSAID\u2019s annual allocations for Myanmar were about $US320 million last year. About $US170 million of that was for humanitarian work, while the rest was for development initiatives such as democracy building and health. Only a few million dollars\u2019 worth of projects remain operational, though some of those programs, including one for maternal and child health, have not received funding despite being told the initiatives are not being closed down. Before the cuts, the annual costs of total US foreign aid were less than 1 per cent of the federal budget. Russian and Chinese rescuers free a woman who had been lying under piles of concrete for two days. Credit: AP At a news conference in Jamaica last week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States would continue foreign aid work, though in drastically reduced form. He said the aim was to provide aid \u201cthat is strategically aligned with our foreign policy priorities and the priorities of our host countries and our nation states that we\u2019re partners with\u201d. On Friday, Tammy Bruce, a US State Department spokesperson, said crisis teams stood ready to deploy to Myanmar.\n\nThe United States\u2019 ability to provide lifesaving aid has been hampered not just by budget cuts but by obstacles in Myanmar itself. Since grabbing power in 2021, Myanmar\u2019s military junta has closed off the country from Western influences. Myanmar is now embroiled in civil war, with a loose coalition of opposition forces having wrested control of more than half the country\u2019s territory. Loading The United States and other Western nations have responded to the junta\u2019s brutal human rights record with sanctions, and the military chief who orchestrated the coup, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has railed against the West, thanking China and Russia for ideological and economic support. Nevertheless, in the hours after the earthquake struck, Min Aung Hlaing said he welcomed outside disaster relief aid \u2013 and not just from countries with friendly relations with the military regime. Myanmar experts say they are concerned that some of the aid that goes through the junta could be diverted to the armed forces. The Myanmar military is underfunded and short on morale as it fights resistance forces on many fronts.\n\nIn Mandalay, residents said they were upset to see soldiers lounging around the sites of collapsed buildings. Some played video games on their phones, while locals used their hands to pry bricks from the rubble. Still, Chinese and Russian search-and-rescue teams, outfitted in orange and blue uniforms, were digging through the wreckage in Mandalay on Sunday, and a Belgian squad was making its way north. People watch rescuers work at the Sky Villa Condo that collapsed in Mandalay. Credit: AP A good chunk of USAID funding had been dedicated to areas of the country not under junta control. US assistance has gone to healthcare and schooling for internally displaced people. It has supported local administrations that are trying to form mini-governments in conflict areas. And it has tried to provide emergency relief to civilians battered by junta airstrikes. In the region of Sagaing, a stronghold of resistance against the junta, Myanmar military jets carried out two rounds of airstrikes on Nwel Khwe village hours after the earthquake destroyed buildings there, adding more terror to residents\u2019 lives.",

We've just had a 20 per cent plus swing to the Liberal party in Collie, where we've just said that, on that coal mining site, at the end of its use, we will site one of the nuclear power stations there. So, I think in the Hunter and elsewhere to be honest, if there is not a replacement industry for coal, then these jobs go. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton was also asked how much how much electricity and gas prices will drop under the Coalition\u2019s plan to increase domestic gas reserves, but he was unable to provide a figure, saying more detail will be released later.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nA survey by Newspoll indicates the government's popularity has risen following the federal budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey published in The Australian newspaper [[late Sunday]] has Labor leading the Coalition 51 per cent to 49 per cent on a two-party-preferred basis, less than five weeks before the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey of over 1,200 voters was conducted from Thursday to Saturday, after the federal budget and budget-in-reply speech from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt showed primary support for Labor lifted from 32 to 33 per cent since a Newspoll in March, while the Coalition recorded a drop of two percentage points to 37 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens remained at 12 per cent, while support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation dropped from seven per cent to six.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Senator Matt Canavan has told Channel Nine he isn't worried about the latest poll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm just glad he's finally called the election; he\u2019s been running scared all year. Now people have their choice. What the polls have shown for ages now is that this is very, very close. Anthony Albanese is up by one point this week, a couple of weeks ago he was down by one point. That's all within the statistical margin of error.

They know that the government is prepared to take strong action and crack down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime minister later said that supermarkets are \"taking the piss of Australian consumers\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what's Albanese promised \u2014 and is price gouging even happening? Here's what you need to know.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Watchdog unveils proposal to end supermarket price-gouging, shrinkflation\n\nWhat has Albanese promised on supermarket price gouging?\n\nAlbanese said that if Labor wins the 3 May federal election, supermarkets found to be price gouging would receive \"heavy fines\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians deserve a fair go at the checkout, and my government will hold the big supermarket chains to account,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher added during a Canberra press conference that the new plans aim to combat rising cost of living pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Anthony Albanese government is focused on responding to those cost of living pressures. We have heard Australians are under pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know prices at the supermarket have hit household budgets, and that's why this government, for the last three years, has been focused on doing what we can to take pressure off households without adding to inflation.\"\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher speaking to reporters in Canberra. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Laws to protect customers from companies engaging in price gouging already exist in the UK, European Union, and dozens of states in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor would first implement recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) supermarket inquiry report to improve transparency about prices, promotions, and loyalty programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nA task force would be set up to advise on introducing an excessive-pricing regime for supermarkets to be policed by the consumer watchdog.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group would include Treasury, the ACCC and other experts who would consult and report to the federal government within six months.\n\n\n\nAre big supermarkets price gouging? It's complicated\n\nAustralia's consumer watchdog released its final report after a year-long supermarket inquiry, finding the dominance of Woolworths and Coles had an \"oligopolistic\" effect on the broader industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the ACCC resisted calls for it to be granted powers to break up the two major corporations, saying there was no \"silver bullet\" to fixing the supermarket sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also said it was \"very difficult\" to tell whether price gouging was actually happening in supermarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't reach that [price gouging] conclusion, and part of the reason is the complexity of making that when you look at the range of products and the different margins that they have, and the fact that they change pricing almost on a weekly basis,\" ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Supermarkets respond to watchdog report as Labor faces fresh calls for breakup powers\n\n\"It's very difficult to get to the bottom of that. The profitability figures do give you some very broad picture of what's happening, but the issue of price gouging isn't one we were able to engage in too closely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACCC found that between 2018 and late 2021, grocery prices increased largely in line with wages, but by the end of 2022 and start of 2023, grocery prices were increasing at more than twice the rate of wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupermarket profits have increased in that time, but the major companies claim it is not a \"dramatic\" rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also didn't seek to determine whether the prices of profit margins at big supermarkets were \"excessive\", as ACCC regulates supermarket conduct \u2014 and running a business at a profit isn't illegal.\n\n\n\nColes, Woolworths reject Albanese's proposal\n\nOn Sunday, Coles, Woolworths and peak retail body the Australian Retailers Association (ARA) responded to the prime minister announcing plans to outlaw price gouging.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Coles rejected claims that the supermarket giant engaged in price gouging and argued their margins are comparable to their peers in countries including Canada, the UK and the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Despite a 12-month inquiry into supermarkets, neither the government or the ACCC found evidence of price gouging,\" they said in a statement to SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's needed are measures that tackle the real factors driving higher grocery prices, which are rising costs such as energy, fuel, labour, insurance, production, freight and distribution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a separate statement, Woolworths echoed Coles' comment that the ACCC's final report found no evidence of price gouging, and said it had taken steps towards fulfilling many of the ACCC's recommendations.\n\n\n\nARA chief industry affairs officer Fleur Brown similarly said that repeated inquiries have \"failed to find any evidence of supermarket price gouging\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ACCC's findings clearly state that grocery inflation has been driven higher by the cost of wages, energy and fuel,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yet, instead of hearing how the government will address these issues, which significantly affect all Australian retailers and consumers, we unfortunately see more taxpayer-funded deflection.\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton spoke at Austral brickworks in Sydney on the second day of campaigning. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nWhat is the Coalition promising on supermarkets?\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton said Albanese couldn't \"stand up to the supermarkets\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would say that the prime minister is weak as water, I really would. The supermarkets know it and Australians know it. I think you've got a prime minister who can't stand up to the supermarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have said to the supermarkets, you rip off Australian consumers, and you continue to believe that your market share gives you power in the market that should be exploited, I will act as prime minister, and this prime minister has demonstrated that he won't.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton says the Coalition's policy is divestiture, a supermarket commissioner and \"significant fines that start at $10 million\".\n\n\n\n\"Prices are up at supermarkets at the moment because of Anthony Albanese. That's the predominant reason.\"\n\n\n\nWhat about the Greens?\n\nIn early March, the Greens announced that a priority for their party would be making price gouging illegal by the middle of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir proposal would create a 'prices commission' to monitor supermarkets for price gouging, with corporations that unreasonably increased prices being subject to massive fines or divestiture. That commission would start operating in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Greens introduced a bill to ban supermarket price gouging, which was voted against by both Labor and the Liberals.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Does Woolworths Metro or Coles Local cost you more? The supermarkets have answered\n\nOn Sunday, Greens leader Adam Bandt took credit for inspiring Labor's proposal, saying on X: \"After adopting most of our plan to see the GP for free, Labor has now followed the Greens' plan to make supermarket price gouging illegal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Nick McKim, the party's economic justice spokesperson, added: \"While Mr Albanese is browsing the Greens' website looking for policy ideas, he should also copy and paste our plan to get dental into Medicare and end native forest logging.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBandt reiterated that the policies should go one step further than fines, and that supermarket companies that abuse their market power should face the prospect of divestiture and face serious penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These supermarkets are making billions of dollars of profits. The fines do need to be high to make sure that the supermarkets listen,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But even more than that, what the Greens want to see is the supermarkets know that they could be broken up as well if they keep on abusing shoppers and abusing their market power, that's where the penalty should be.\"\n\n\n\nWill a price gouging ban make groceries cheaper?\n\nWhile there are hopes that a mission to stamp out price gouging may lead to better grocery prices, not everyone is convinced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The widely popular narrative of 'stamping out price gouging' by dragging supermarket chief executives into public hearings and threatening them with jail time might have inferred such inquiries would lead to lower food prices,\" Gary Mortimer, professor of marketing and consumer behaviour at Queensland University of Technology, wrote in The Conversation earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In isolation, they have not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile supermarkets face scrutiny, it's unclear if consumers will feel the difference at the checkout.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A measles outbreak in the United States has claimed two lives, as hundreds of people have been infected and large numbers of children hospitalised with complications.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities say the best way to prevent outbreaks is through vaccination.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some doctors have reported patients are sceptical of immunisation and that there are large pockets of unvaccinated communities in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, experts say there's been a decline around the world and not just the US, because of issues with access to vaccines \u2014 and rising suspicion and mistrust in them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the US grapples with a resurgence of the disease, is there a risk anti-vaccine messaging could take hold in Australia?\n\n\n\nWhat does the US measles outbreak look like?\n\nThe number of confirmed cases this year has already surpassed the total of 285 recorded in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 17 states have recorded more than 370 cases of measles, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with 64 hospitalisations and two deaths. The majority of cases are in children who are either unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is known.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) have been reported this year so far, with 90 per cent of confirmed cases (341 of 378) being outbreak-associated.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Robert F Kennedy Jr announces major slashing of US public health agencies\n\nMeasles was once considered eliminated in the US, thanks to the MMR vaccine and high immunisation rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's a highly contagious disease and experts say at least 95 per cent of a community must be vaccinated to stop outbreaks. That's not the case in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccination rates have declined nationwide in the US since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the vaccination threshold for kindergarteners.\n\n\n\nA child receives an MMR vaccine in the US state of Texas on 1 March, where cases are on the rise. Source: Getty / Jan Sonnenmair\n\nInternational outlook\n\nLast week, Mexico's government said it would step up a measles vaccination campaign after cases surged in an area bordering the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico had confirmed 43 measles cases, 39 of which were recorded in the northern state of Chihuahua and linked to imported infections.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Vietnam, a recent statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) said a measles outbreak there was \"still very much ongoing\". Some recent media reports say the country has recorded about 40,000 suspected cases since the start of the year.\n\n\n\nIn Europe, measles cases doubled in Europe in 2024 to a 25-year high, according to the WHO.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, 127,350 cases of measles and 38 deaths were registered in the WHO's European region, which counts 53 countries and includes central Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf of the European cases required hospitalisation, the WHO said, noting that 40 per cent of cases involved children under the age of five.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria's chief health officer recently warned case numbers were rising in Thailand, India, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\n\n\nMeasles in Australia\n\nThe Department of Health's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System has reported 37 infections in Australia this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 57 cases were registered, up from 26 in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO declared measles eliminated from Australia in 2014, but the virus can still enter the through international travel. This year's confirmed cases are primarily returned travellers and their close contacts, and the majority of them have been in NSW and Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is below the World Health Organization's measles vaccination target rate of a 95 per cent, according to the health department.\n\n\n\nVaccine access, and scepticism, in Australia\n\nAssociate Professor Frank Beard is with the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, which reports every year on vaccination rates across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Vaccination coverage has been creeping down over the last few years since the COVID-19 pandemic ... So (a) modest decrease, but it is concerning because before the pandemic, coverage had been pretty steadily increasing for the previous eight years or so,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaediatrician Margie Danchin, from the University of Melbourne and the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, said the decrease had especially been seen in particular communities and age groups.\n\n\n\nShe said childhood vaccine coverage rates at ages one, two and five have been steadily declining in Australia since 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest decline has actually been in First Nations children around that one-to-two-year time point, particularly in the Northern Territory, for example,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a big issue in Australia, and we're also ripe for a measles outbreak in this country, not just in the Asia-Pacific region.\"\n\n\n\nMeasles is caused by a virus and presents as a highly infectious itchy rash with a fever. It mainly affects children, but one infection usually gives life-long immunity. Credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRA/Getty Images/Science Photo Libra Danchin said there were also clearly defined geographical areas in Australia that had lower vaccine coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In general, measles vaccination coverage is reasonably high. Of course, that very much depends geographically ... We do have quite big pockets of low vaccine coverage around Australia, for example, in the Northern Rivers region in New South Wales, but also in inner city Melbourne and Sydney,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf suspicion and mistrust of vaccines were behind lower vaccination rates in the US, that's not the case for Australia, Danchin said.\n\n\n\nWhile there are vaccine sceptics, access is the major issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are practical barriers to vaccination. So, not being able to make an appointment or pay for the appointment. Not being able to travel to get an appointment if a mother has lots of kids, or get time off work, for example,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeard said there was concern about local outbreaks because of gaps in vaccination coverage, and unvaccinated people bringing measles back with them after overseas travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia was certified by the World Health Organization as having eliminated local measles transmission here back in 2014. Since then we have had some cases and outbreaks, and they've almost always been linked to unvaccinated people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians going overseas and then coming back with measles; or tourists from overseas with measles. And so there have been a lot of measles outbreaks over the last couple of years overseas that increases the risk that measles will be imported into Australia.\"\n\n\n\n",

We need measures that reduce red tape, increase productivity or drive down costs.\"\n\nREAD MORE Watchdog unveils proposal to end supermarket price-gouging, shrinkflation\n\nWhat did the ACCC's report find?\n\nEarlier this month, Australia's consumer watchdog, the ACCC, released its final report after a year-long supermarket inquiry.\n\nWhile it did not release definitive evidence of price gouging, it found the market dominance of Woolworths and Coles had an \"oligopolistic\" effect on the broader industry and that the pair are among the most profitable supermarket businesses in the world.\n\nIt found that between 2018 and late 2021, grocery prices increased largely in line with wages, but by the end of 2022 and start of 2023, grocery prices were increasing at more than twice the rate of wage growth. Supermarket profits have increased in that time, but the major companies claim it is not a \"dramatic\" rise.\n\nWhen it released its report, ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said it was \"very difficult\" to tell whether price gouging was happening in supermarkets.\n\n\"The profitability figures do give you some very broad picture of what's happening, but the issue of price gouging isn't one we were able to engage in too closely.\"\n\n\u2014 Alex Gallagher",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nMostafa Azimitabar is still haunted by memories of his six years detained on Manus Island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to escape from it because it's like a shadow. Trauma for me is like a shadow. If I escape from it, it will follow me. The best way is to deal with the pain - that it happened, it's a part of me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kurdish refugee says he still struggles to unpack his trauma from that time - which was followed by over a year detained in two Melbourne hotels, after being transferred to Australia to treat severe asthma and mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like I'm holding maybe a knife and I'm carving the words on my skin, it's so difficult... that's why sometimes I feel not at the moment, I have to be patient. It will be okay, it's not the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2020 report in the British Journal of Psychology that looked at refugees resettling in high-income countries found one in three globally have experienced some form of mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a new study from the University of New South Wales has found those who have experienced offshore detention, or prolonged onshore detention, are more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder compared to other refugees.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Philippa Specker was the lead researcher on the British Journal of Psychology report, and says individuals are more likely to experience PTSD when they feel unsafe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who experience detention might be witnessing or experiencing further traumatic or adverse events that add to their mental health burden, and might make them even more at risk of having mental health problems, even years after joining the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Specker says not all detention experiences carry the same risk for mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who spend time in offshore detention are 20 times more likely to develop PTSD compared to those who spent less than six months in onshore detention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in prolonged onshore detention, or for longer than six months, were almost 17 times more likely to report PTSD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There seems to be something about being detained in a facility offshore that puts someone at especially high risk. I think when we consider what this experience might feel like for someone who's come to Australia seeking asylum, they arrive in Australia seeking asylum and are then relocated to a third country by the very government, they're asking to give them safety and support. So it's understandable that this might undermine people's sense of security and certainty about the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blue's chief executive Georgie Harman says this is a situation where mental health literacy comes into play.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales Mental Health Commission says this type of literacy is about people's knowledge of health care systems, and their ability and confidence in accessing and understanding them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Harman says for culturally and linguistically diverse people generally, mental health literacy is far lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People from CALD communities access mental health support often when they're in extreme distress or crisis. We also know that they don't seek support at the same rates as the rest of the general population. And again there are a whole range of reasons for that: language barriers, confusion about the system, which is really confusing for most of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis resonates for Reshma Manandhar, who migrated from Nepal to Australia 20 years ago and believes she struggled with post-natal depression after the birth of her first child, despite not having the language for what she was experiencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the big mental health issue for me was when I had my son, and I think I had post-natal depression but I wasn't aware of it. It was a very difficult time for me - having a kid here, being in a completely different environment, not the support that I'm used to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blue has formed a new partnership with settlement agency AMES that it hopes will improve mental health awareness in migrant and refugee communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partnership looks to reach people in community, offering mental health training to AMES staff, and providing easy English support resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMES CEO Cath Scarth says reaching people in a culturally safe environment is essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For us at AMES, we have, I suppose, four key determinants that we think are critical for successful settlement. The obvious ones, education, speaking, English, safe, secure housing, obviously employment. But the fourth critical pillar is really about health and wellbeing, and mental health is a critical part of that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReshma now works as a coordinator in community engagement for AMES.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes her experiences will help others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my community, most of us, we've come from Nepal and we are facing similar challenges. And when we talk about it, it makes it normal. It normalises it. And then when you say, oh, there is a help available, you can seek help, or, oh, I have gone to see someone, and that really helped. That opens up and that makes it normal. And that sort of says to other people that, yes, you can access help. It is all right to seek help. It is all right to say, you know what, I have a problem in the first place. Sometimes we don't even admit to ourselves that we have problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mostafa, he says professional support has failed him so far - and that psychologists must be skilled to navigate this unique trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I see they try to engage with what I am talking about, but they don't understand it because they were not in detention. It's very complicated. It's not easy when I share this. It's not something simple. Someone was in detention for a decade and comes out and go to another room. Okay, I'm going to share what happened to me with a psychologist. The psychologist should have the qualification of dealing with high level of trauma. Otherwise, the trauma becomes much bigger to the person.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a battle Mostafa is still navigating after he lost an appeal in a 2022 High court case, which found Australia's hotel detention is legal but 'lacked human decency'.\n\n\n\n\n\nA current case is arguing against an asylum seeker's removal to Nauru detention under the government's new powers to deport anyone without a visa to third countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment who have not yet responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, still living in limbo on a bridging visa, Moz has turned to art, produced with some unusual tools.\n\n\n\n",

And that reservoir is the ocean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral companies are testing a new theory that the carbon dioxide currently in the ocean can be reduced by changing it from a gas to a solid.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Burt is the chief ocean scientist at one of those companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis workplace, Planetary Technologies, has been using magnesium oxide to try to lock away carbon dioxide for centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You add an alkaline or a basic mineral to the ocean and that mineral is essentially an antacid. It neutralises acid the same way an antacid neutralises acid in your stomach. This alkaline mineral neutralises carbon dioxide acid in the ocean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome companies are using other items such as rocks or nutrients to try to produce the same effect, while others use seaweed and algae to absorb carbon similar to the way plants do it on land.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting from Planetary Technologies has found no risk to marine ecosystems from magnesium oxide so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some are still concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Lapp, who works at fishing company SeaFreeze, says there are environmental protection concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't dump poison on your farmland. You don't dump poison in the ocean. And, you know, back in the 1970s we created the Clean Water Act to ensure that we have clean water and we're not dumping chemicals into the ocean. And now to be doing that in the name of carbon capture to me is just irresponsible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve its full impact, carbon dioxide removal needs to occur on a much larger scale than it currently does.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Ho is also the co-founder of non-profit business C-Worthy, which focuses on using the seas to fight climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group is developing technology to assess the impact of marine carbon removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The experiments that are being done now and the scale at which they're being done, it's pretty safe. The question is what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year? And that's still to be determined.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains further challenges will arise with the growth in scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a challenge in the amount of energy that's needed, the amount of stuff we need to move around, the infrastructure that's needed. And there's also the challenge of who's going to pay for it because it's going to cost trillions of dollars every year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDebates continue in the industry over how to balance the potential benefits to the environment and the risks of adding new materials to the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs tests are conducted from the waters of North America through to New Zealand, developments in the understanding of marine carbon removal are likely to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are problems still to be solved, Planetary's Chief Scientist Will Burt says there is no time to delay.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Hi, over the next five weeks, I\u2019ll be blogging about the seat of Wills as the 2025 federal election unfolds.\n\nI\u2019m normally an investigative reporter for The Age \u2013 investigative reporters never miss an opportunity to push their stories, so please read my most recent reporting on Australia\u2019s $4 billion cosmetic injectables industry here. But during the federal election, I\u2019ll follow full-time Labor MP Peter Khalil, the Greens\u2019 Samantha Ratnam, Liberal Jeff Kidney, Socialist Sue Bolton, and all of the other candidates in this northern suburbs seat.\n\nVictorian Labor MP Peter Khalil. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nWills covers progressive northern suburbs like Brunswick and Coburg and Labor-leaning areas like Pascoe Vale, Fawkner, Oak Park and Glenroy. But a redistribution has added some of Australia\u2019s most green booths \u2014 in North Fitzroy and North Carlton \u2014 to Wills for the first time.\n\nThis will likely hand Ratnam and the Greens an advantage. However, as I moved around the seat in the last week, preparing for the launch of this blog today, I noticed plenty of Peter Khalil signs on house fences in both North Carlton and North Fitzroy. Maybe that advantage, like so many Greens predictions of victory here, will be an illusion again: it\u2019s been a phenomenon in this seat for more than a decade that the Greens talk up their chance of snatching Wills from Labor and then ultimately a win fails to materialise.\n\nAt the 2022 election, I spent six fascinating weeks in the seat of Chisholm, roaming its suburbs which include Box Hill, Burwood, Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley. There, it was clear a few weeks out that Liberal MP Gladys Liu would struggle to hold the seat from Labor\u2019s Carina Garland. Ultimately, Garland won easily with a 7 per cent swing to her and Labor. So far in Wills, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the Greens\u2019 talk of this being a potential win is just that \u2013 talk \u2013 or if the voters of this economically and ethnically diverse seat will finally turn out for them. Or will they back Khalil and the status quo? Ratnam has stood in Wills against Khalil before, in 2016. Then, she came close to ending the party\u2019s near-continuous hold on the seat since its creation in 1949. Ratnam secured 45 per cent of the vote that year. Khalil ultimately won but had to rely on preferences from other parties. Since then, no Greens candidate has come near Khalil, who has expanded his majority in the seat on a two-party preferred basis to 9 per cent.\n\nLoading\n\nKhalil, 52, was born in Melbourne to Egyptian parents and grew up in public housing. Ratnam, 47 and born to Sri Lankan parents who left that country because of civil war, is a strong candidate in her own right. In the nine years since she last ran, Ratnam\u2019s profile has grown and grown \u2013 first as the mayor of Moreland (now Merri-bek) Council, and then as the state leader of the Greens in Victoria. Wills, famously represented by former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke from 1980 until his retirement in 1992, is named after William John Wills who, alongside Robert O\u2019Hara Burke, perished on their ill-fated expedition from Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nAt the centre of Wills is Bell Street, the major arterial road which once acted as the so-called hipster proof fence in previous elections, with Labor voters to the north and Greens voters to the south. But rising house prices punched a hole in that fence, with younger, Greens-voting progressives increasingly settling in suburbs such as Pascoe Vale and Coburg North. The big issues here, like everywhere in Australia right now, are housing, the cost of living, health policy and particularly whether people can afford it.\n\nBut the vicious politics over Israel and Palestine is the really significant factor in this suburb \u2013 just like it is in many of Sydney\u2019s most ethnically diverse seats. Ten per cent of Wills was Muslim at the 2021 Census, so Palestine is sure to be a big focus. The first time I chatted to both of the campaign teams for either side, they talked up what I can only assume is their hoped-for outcome on this issue. Labor argues Israel-Palestine is of vastly less importance to most voters in this seat than the more mainstream issues like health and the cost of living. The Greens say Israel-Palestine is the first thing many residents talk about when Ratnam and her team doorknock homes here. So we will see.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an exciting five weeks. Please send any tips you\u2019ve got relating to this seat, to any of the candidates, or really anything a voter in Wills might be interested in, to my email, clucas@theage.com.au, my Proton mail, claylucas@protonmail.com, or via Signal on +61439828128. This really will be one of the most fascinating battles in Australian politics in 2025 \u2013 I hope you will follow it with me.",

    "text": "The employees who received lay-off notices were told they should go home that afternoon. Some had been co-ordinating with aid missions in Bangkok, the Thai capital, and Manila, capital of the Philippines, which handle disaster response in Asia. Two of the employees in Washington had expected to move this winter to Yangon, in Myanmar, and to Bangkok to work as humanitarian assistance advisers out of the US missions there. But those positions were cut. Had they not been, the two employees would have been on the ground to organise urgent responses to the earthquake. After the disaster hit on Friday, the US embassy in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, sent a cable to USAID headquarters in Washington to start the process of evaluating aid needs and getting help out the door. And the next day, a Trump administration political appointee in USAID, Tim Meisburger, held a call with officials from national security agencies to discuss a plan. But Meisburger said that while there would be a response, no one should expect the agency\u2019s capabilities to be what they were in the past, a person with direct knowledge of the call said.\n\nA USAID spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment. The agency typically has access to food and emergency supplies in warehouses in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Subang Jaya, Malaysia. But the big question now is how quickly, after being almost fully dismantled, it can get goods from those places into Myanmar. The goods include medical kits that can each serve the healthcare needs of 30,000 people for more than three months. Russian search-and-rescue teams with their dogs in Myanmar. Credit: Russia Emergency Ministry press service via AP Apart from career diplomats, the ranks of the agency\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance have included crisis specialist contractors who live around the world and can deploy quickly in what are called Disaster Assistance Response Teams. Many of those contractors have been fired, and the infrastructure to support them in Washington and other offices \u2013 people who can book flights and manage payments, for instance \u2013 was crippled by cuts over the past two months. The agency would also usually put certified search-and-rescue teams in Virginia and Southern California on alert for possible deployment to the disaster zone, but transportation contracts for those teams had been cut, a former aid agency employee said.\n\nUSAID\u2019s annual allocations for Myanmar were about $US320 million last year. About $US170 million of that was for humanitarian work, while the rest was for development initiatives such as democracy building and health. Only a few million dollars\u2019 worth of projects remain operational, though some of those programs, including one for maternal and child health, have not received funding despite being told the initiatives are not being closed down. Before the cuts, the annual costs of total US foreign aid were less than 1 per cent of the federal budget. Russian and Chinese rescuers free a woman who had been lying under piles of concrete for two days. Credit: AP At a news conference in Jamaica last week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States would continue foreign aid work, though in drastically reduced form. He said the aim was to provide aid \u201cthat is strategically aligned with our foreign policy priorities and the priorities of our host countries and our nation states that we\u2019re partners with\u201d. On Friday, Tammy Bruce, a US State Department spokesperson, said crisis teams stood ready to deploy to Myanmar.\n\nThe United States\u2019 ability to provide lifesaving aid has been hampered not just by budget cuts but by obstacles in Myanmar itself. Since grabbing power in 2021, Myanmar\u2019s military junta has closed off the country from Western influences. Myanmar is now embroiled in civil war, with a loose coalition of opposition forces having wrested control of more than half the country\u2019s territory. Loading The United States and other Western nations have responded to the junta\u2019s brutal human rights record with sanctions, and the military chief who orchestrated the coup, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has railed against the West, thanking China and Russia for ideological and economic support. Nevertheless, in the hours after the earthquake struck, Min Aung Hlaing said he welcomed outside disaster relief aid \u2013 and not just from countries with friendly relations with the military regime. Myanmar experts say they are concerned that some of the aid that goes through the junta could be diverted to the armed forces. The Myanmar military is underfunded and short on morale as it fights resistance forces on many fronts.\n\nIn Mandalay, residents said they were upset to see soldiers lounging around the sites of collapsed buildings. Some played video games on their phones, while locals used their hands to pry bricks from the rubble. Still, Chinese and Russian search-and-rescue teams, outfitted in orange and blue uniforms, were digging through the wreckage in Mandalay on Sunday, and a Belgian squad was making its way north. People watch rescuers work at the Sky Villa Condo that collapsed in Mandalay. Credit: AP A good chunk of USAID funding had been dedicated to areas of the country not under junta control. US assistance has gone to healthcare and schooling for internally displaced people. It has supported local administrations that are trying to form mini-governments in conflict areas. And it has tried to provide emergency relief to civilians battered by junta airstrikes. In the region of Sagaing, a stronghold of resistance against the junta, Myanmar military jets carried out two rounds of airstrikes on Nwel Khwe village hours after the earthquake destroyed buildings there, adding more terror to residents\u2019 lives.",

However, a retail union secretary told Yahoo News the emergence of such technology is likely a good thing for the workforce.\n\nThe robot in question appeared to have a flashing safety light and was covered in Woolworths branding as it pushed the trolleys back towards the bay. It is unclear whether the person behind the camera capturing the video in Brisbane was a shopper or worker, however, they joked the supermarket giant has now \"hired R2-D2\" and paid tribute to the workers who used to do the job of collecting stray trolleys from the premises.\n\nThere was a mixed response from shocked shoppers online, with many concerned the technology will make it increasingly more difficult for \"desperate job seekers\".\n\n\"We are going to have so many problems with these,\" one person commented online, while another worried they be taking jobs away. However some Aussies applauded the apparent introduction of the technology, believing it will help ease workers' load.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever not much is known about the mysterious Woolworths-branded bot. Yahoo News reached out to the company to ask about the robot on Friday last week, but the supermarket giant has not provided any information.\n\nSupermarket union supports 'tool of the trade'\n\nDespite some panic over what the implications of this will be on supermarket workers, the secretary of the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU), Josh Cullinan, told Yahoo News he doesn't believe the technology will replace staff \u2014 at least not while they are being controlled by workers via a device.\n\n\"It looks like a human controlled device that pushes the trolleys and assists the worker, not that it is working autonomously,\" Cullinan told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis \"tool of the trade\" will likely help workers, rather than threaten their jobs, as the laborious task of collecting and pushing heavy trolleys across the car park will now be left to the robot.\n\n\"It's not dissimilar to electric pallet jacks being introduced. Basic pallet jacks were just these things on wheels, and moving stock into trucks was horrendous because any bump or slope would risk everything toppling [over], but electric pallet jacks have been a big benefit for workers.\n\n\"If it's a device to help control and push trolleys and it takes the weight off a human being, then that is something we support,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "Starting from the next financial year, traffic fines in Queensland will increase again to new all time highs.\n\nFines handed down on Queensland's roads are set to rise in the coming months. Source: Getty/Reddit\n\nDrivers caught breaking the law on the road will soon cop even heftier fines in one state as the country's harshest government is again set to increase penalties for motorists.\n\nQueensland's state government fines are scheduled to rise by 3.5 per cent starting next financial year, meaning anyone caught speeding up to 10 kilometres per hour over the speed limit will cop a $333 fine \u2014 a rise of $11 from last year.\n\nThe increase will mean anyone caught wearing their seatbelt incorrectly or using their phone behind the wheel will face a $1,250 infringement, up $42.\n\nIn 2024, the former Labor government hiked up infringements by 4.2 per cent for the 2024-25 financial year. While in 2023, they rose 7.7 per cent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe annual increase in state government fines in Queensland is tied to a default rate of 3.5 per cent to ensure penalties maintain their deterrent effect over time. By law, the government can only raise fines by the default rate unless Treasurer David Janetzki approves a different increase by the end of March.\n\nJanetzki confirmed fines will be capped at 3.5 per cent this coming financial year. The rate is built into legislation to provide a consistent and predictable framework for fine adjustments without requiring frequent government intervention.\n\nFrom the start of the next financial year, fines in Queensland will rise by 3.5 per cent. Source: TfNSW\n\nHow much are road fines rising by in Queensland?\n\nThe Treasurer\u2019s decision, typically made before the end of March each year, takes into account factors such as cost-of-living pressures, revenue needs and the effectiveness of fines in promoting compliance with laws. \"Any change will be applied in accordance with the process under the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992,\" a statement from Janetzki to the ABC read.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose who disobey stop signs or fail to give way to a pedestrian will face a $500 fine, increasing by $17 from the last financial year. Drivers who are travelling more than 40km/h over the speed limit will cop a massive $1,918 fine, increasing by $65 from current rates.\n\nThe increase in fines and forfeitures is anticipated to generate $912m in the 2025-26 budget, according to the report. Last year\u2019s budget had flagged revenue of $794m in the 2024-25 financial year, increasing from the $741m the year before.\n\nIn 2021, the state government introduced advanced detection cameras across Queensland, which have led to a large increase in the number of infringements handed out to drivers.\n\nPrior to installing the hi-tech cameras \u2013 which target drivers using their phones and those not wearing seatbelts \u2013 the State Penalties Enforcement Registry was chasing $8.7m in unpaid fines. That figure has since jumped to $110m, with the SPER hunting down more than 100,000 unpaid fines.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is also approximately $51m worth of unpaid seatbelt-related fines on the books.\n\nYahoo News Australia has contacted the Queensland Treasurer's office for comment.\n\nwith NCA Newswire\n\nDo you have a story tip?
