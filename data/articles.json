        "text": "The US is at a low risk of an imminent debt crisis \u2013 but high risk in the long term, billionaire investor Ray Dalio writes in a new book.\n\nThe US government debt situation is \"nearing the point of no return\" and approaching a \"death spiral\" that could threaten the stability of the world's largest economy, he writes in the book, How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle , published today.\n\nSome economists and investors have been sounding the alarm about the deficit for years. But this year, Wall Street has begun to heed caution as US President Donald Trump's tariffs and tax bill agenda have stoked volatility in the bond market, which is the usually quiet bedrock of the US and global economies.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, speaks during an event on May 22 at the Paley Centre for Media in New York. (The Paley Centre for Media via CNN)\n\nInvestors are increasingly concerned about the potential for Trump's \"big, beautiful\" tax bill to put pressure on the federal debt burden at a time when there is uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and the appeal of US assets.\n\nIn May, the rate the US government has to pay investors for a 30-year loan spiked to its highest level since 2023.\n\nThat's because investors either sold or refused to buy bonds and demanded higher compensation in exchange for what looked like a riskier loan to the US government.\n\nDalio is the latest billionaire to sound the alarm over the US debt and deficit, with worries that the vast government debt will crowd out spending on essential services to leave a hollowed-out economy that can't work for its citizens and which spooks global investors.\n\nREAD MORE: Ukraine tips the scales with explosive strike on crucial link \ufeff\n\nTrump's tariffs and tax bill have been widely criticised. (AP)\n\nThere is a \"very low imminent risk\" of a US government debt crisis, but a \"very high long-term risk,\" Dalio writes in the book.\n\n\"Even though this progression has happened many times in history, most policy makers and investors think their current circumstances and monetary system won't change,\" Dalio writes.\n\n\"The change is unthinkable \u2013 and then it happens suddenly.\"\n\nA higher deficit means the Treasury might need to sell more bonds to finance its spending and interest payments.\n\nA debt \"death spiral\" describes when a government needs to issue more bonds to raise money to pay its existing debts, but faces less demand and has to pay investors more and more interest for them to bite.\n\nThere has been turmoil on Wall Street. (AP)\n\n\"A spiral of rising interest rates leading to worsening credit risk, leading to less demand for the debt, leading to higher interest rates is a classic debt 'death spiral',\" Dalio writes.\n\nThe higher interest rates investors demand to loan the government money leave less money for running a country, increase interest rates for consumers and businesses and generally leave a country with fewer options to raise cash.\n\n\"To me, that suggests that US policy makers should be more, not less, conservative in dealing with the government's finances because the worst thing possible would be to have its finances in bad shape during difficult times,\" Dalio writes.\n\nTurmoil in the bond market\n\nTrump's tax bill is set to raise the deficit because it slashes tax revenues without enough cuts to spending to balance things out.\n\nThe current US deficit is on unsustainable path and is \"more than the market can bear,\" Dalio said at an event on May 22 in New York ahead of the book's release.\n\nHe said that he anticipates it will be roughly three years before the US is in a \"critical situation\".\n\n\"I think we should be afraid of the bond market,\" Dalio said.\n\n\"I can tell you that this is very, very serious.\"\n\nTax cuts can be a boon for Wall Street, and the stock market cheered Trump's tax cuts during his first term.\n\nBut what makes this time different is adding to the deficit while the federal debt burden has ballooned: the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced in the economy, soared from 104 per cent in 2017 to 123 per cent in 2024, according to the Treasury Department.\n\n\"We're now talking about deficits and a national debt-to-GDP ratio that are really going to be unprecedented, except for recent recessionary times,\" Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, previously told CNN.\n\nDalio's book comes out days after JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday at the Reagan National Economic Forum that a \"crack\" in the bond market \"is going to happen\".\n\n\"The US long bond is already near its highest levels since the (2008 financial crisis),\" Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an analyst at Barclays, said in a recent note.\n\n\"As markets absorb the details of the new tax bill, and realise that deficits are likely to keep rising for the foreseeable future, the risk is that longer yields keep rising as well.\"\n\nNor have Democrats and Republicans shown they can work together on the problem, Dalio said at the May 22 event.\n\n\"It's like being on a boat that's headed for rocks,\" he said, \"and they agree that they should turn, but they can't agree on how to turn.\"",

He is very happy, healthy and intelligent,\" Kaur said.\n\nWhile the Brisbane mother and lawyer marvels at how well her child's conception and birth via IVF turned out, Kaur says she cannot forget one traumatic incident that happened in between, which still haunts her.\n\nAri is a healthy and happy boy, but he was almost never born due to a mix-up in the mail. (Supplied: Saran Kaur)\n\nFor four stressful days, Kaur thought her hopes of having a third child were destroyed when her final six embryos were inexplicably lost in the post.\n\nIt was four-and-a-half years ago, in November 2020, and Kaur had arranged for her embryos to be flown from Melbourne to Brisbane.\n\nThe embryos were being transferred from the clinic where she completed the IVF treatments for her first two children, Melbourne IVF, to closer to home at Monash IVF in Brisbane.\n\nAfter six months of paperwork delays, the day finally arrived when the embryos were to be transported interstate - November 23.\n\nThat morning, Kaur said Melbourne IVF notified her that the embryos had been picked up via a third-party courier organised by Monash IVF.\n\nThe embryos were due to arrive at the Brisbane clinic later the same day, Kaur said, adding that she was told she would get a call when the journey was complete.\n\nKaur said she was on alert, but not overly concerned when she did not hear from Monash IVF on the first day.\n\n\"I didn't call them that day. I thought, 'Oh, maybe they're busy. I'll call them tomorrow',\" she said.\n\nSaran Kaur's son, Ari, was born a year after the postal mix-up. (Supplied: Saran Kaur)\n\nWhen Kaur rang Monash IVF the next morning, she was alarmed when staff could not tell her where the embryos were.\n\n\"They said, 'We don't know where they are. They should have arrived. They might be in the lab'. They were just very vague,\" Kaur said.\n\nWhen she did not get a call back from the lab staff, Kaur said she tried to escalate her case with a more senior staff member at Monash IVF that same afternoon.\n\nHowever, the staff member could not provide any more answers about where the embryos were.\n\n\"No-one knew where they were. I was shaking. I don't know what to do, because they could have been left anywhere - in a storage shed at the airport, or in someone's van.\"\n\nFor two more agonising days, Kaur said she was left in the dark.\n\nKaur said what frustrated and angered her the most was that Monash IVF did not seem to be very concerned at all.\n\nThey should have been treating her embryos like the potential people they were, not just a package, she said.\n\n\"You can imagine my anxiety, and nobody was listening to me,\" she said.\n\nFinally, on November 26 - day four - Kaur said she got a call from Melbourne IVF.\n\n\"They told me that my embryos had been returned there and asked what was happening,\" Kaur said.\n\nKaur said she felt relief to hear that the embryos had been found, but that relief was almost immediately replaced with anxiety over whether the embryos were okay.\n\nA scientist at Melbourne IVF then explained that the Cryoguard indicator on the cannister containing the embryos was green, indicating they had been kept at a suitable temperature and were therefore still viable.\n\nThe embryos were flown interstate in a temperature-controlled cannister. (iStock)\n\nEven so, a niggling anxiety would follow Kaur throughout her pregnancy.\n\n\"All the time I was pregnant with my son, it was still in the back of my mind, I was wondering, what happens if they were damaged, what if my son has a disability or something?\" Kaur said.\n\n\"How sure were they that they were still viable? I didn't know, until I had my son and I could see that he was healthy - you lose your trust.\"\n\nAfter the mix-up in the post, Kaur decided to keep her embryos with Melbourne IVF, and completed her IVF journey there.\n\nShe lodged a complaint with Monash IVF, which investigated the incident.\n\nIn a legal letter sent to Kaur via the clinic's lawyers, seen by 9news.com.au , Monash IVF blamed Melbourne IVF and the third-party couriers they engaged for the confusion.\n\nThe cannister containing the embryos was incorrectly packaged by Melbourne IVF, the letter said.\n\nThe embryos were then held by the courier company at its sorting facility, before being returned to Melbourne IVF three days later.\n\n\"The courier company failed to advise our client of this and it was not until November 26 that our client was notified that the delivery of the embryos had not been successful.\n\nMonash IVF had \"no control over the circumstances\", the letter stated.\n\nA spokesperson for Monash IVF told 9news.com.au : \"We understand and acknowledge the patient's concerns about what occurred. Monash IVF takes the utmost care with the transport of cryopreserved material, however, in this instance, at no time was Monash IVF in possession of the patient's embryos.\n\n\"We are pleased to learn that the patient has been successful in her IVF journey and wish her and her family all the best for the future.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Melbourne IVF denied the embryos were incorrectly packaged.\n\n\"Melbourne IVF followed best practice protocols for the safe preparation, labelling, and packaging of this embryo transfer, which was arranged by Monash IVF using their chosen third-party courier,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The embryos were returned to Melbourne IVF after the courier failed to complete the delivery.\n\n\"We recognise the emotional toll this experience had on the patient and are pleased we were able to continue her care and support a successful outcome at Melbourne IVF.\"\n\nKaur said Monash IVF should have kept her updated throughout the transportation process.\n\nWhen news broke last month about an IVF mix-up that saw a Brisbane woman give birth to someone else's baby after the wrong embryo was transferred - also involving a Monash IVF clinic in Brisbane - Kaur said it resurfaced a lot of unpleasant memories about her own experience.\n\n\"When I read about that case, I got a flashback. I was thinking, 'Oh my God, that poor woman',\" Kaur said.",

(iStock)\n\n\"The types of injuries ranged from minor fractures and injuries, through to traumatic brain injuries requiring a craniotomy.\n\n'\"A lot of the parents attending were extremely upset to see their child hospitalised and weren't aware how risky e-scooters can be or the legal requirement for supervision under 16.\"\n\nThe release of the research follows an announcement from the Queensland Government that it will hold a public enquiry into e-scooters and other mobility devices.\n\nQueensland and ACT are currently the only two states that allow e-scooter use under 16 years of age. Clanfield is calling for a minimum age of 16 to be imposed in Queensland until safety measures are improved.\n\nPublic Health Association of Australia chief executive, Adjunct Professor Terry Slevin, said e-scooters were a public health and safety concern across Australia.\n\nClear skies and crystal water hide this island's dangerous secret View Gallery\n\n\"We understand that e-scooters can be a fun and convenient way to travel, but unfortunately the way they are being used now, particularly by teens and children at high speeds, are proving a genuine public health risk and injury prevention issue,\" Slevin said.\n\n\"This study provides data in one region and in one hospital, but this is an issue in every town and city where they have landed across Australia, including in busier areas.\n\n\"This study found almost 180 kids were hospitalised in one regional area, at one hospital. Multiply that finding across Queensland and Australia and we are looking at thousands of preventable injuries, as well as lives lost. It is the tip of the iceberg.\"",

The RBA was too slow to lift rates, and it didn't want to make the same mistake when cutting them, the central bank's governor has told a parliamentary committee.\n\nIn its latest economic statement, the Reserve Bank forecast annual GDP growth of 1.8 per cent by the end of the June quarter, picking up to 2.1 per cent by the end of this year \u2014 a downgrade to its previous forecasts after the Trump administration's shock tariff announcement in April.\n\nIt means the economy will have to grow noticeably in the June quarter to meet that annual target.\n\nData show government spending did not grow in the March quarter.\n\nCommonwealth spending on social benefits to households remained low, and state and local governments spent less on social benefits to households for energy bill relief. That was offset by more commonwealth spending on defence.\n\nGDP per person fell 0.2 per cent in the quarter, following a 0.1 per cent rise in the December 2024 quarter, the ABS said.",

The AFL players' association says it is disappointed the league did not heed its request for any double-headers featuring men's and women's games.\n\nThe Giants particularly thought it would work for their round-24 men's home match at the Sydney Showground against St Kilda.\n\nHowever, their women's team were scheduled to play in Melbourne that weekend against Collingwood instead.\n\nGWS's executive general manager of AFLW and football operations, Alison Zell, said while she understood double-headers might not work for all clubs, it would have been feasible from the Giants' perspective and helped grow their fanbase.\n\n\"We're a young club with a new audience, a new fan base, and we want to be able to build that across our men's and women's program,\" Zell told ABC Sport.\n\n\"We think we've got this great prospect and a unique proposition to be able to bring new fans in by showcasing the men's and women's games together.\n\n\"That's why we're really disappointed to not get the opportunity to do that this season.\"\n\nThe Giants feel double-headers would have appealed to their fan base.

And what you don't want is people who represent the club, or who work for the club, having to choose which program they work on or they'd rather be at.\"\n\nJust over a month before the new fixture release, AFLW general manager Emma Moore said a key strategy of the league was aiming to foster a \"one club, two teams\" approach.\n\n\"While we're working through the fixture, one of the things we're focusing on is optimising what we can do in terms of the crossover of the women's and men's competition, and clearly double-headers are part of that conversation,\" Moore said at the season opener announcement.\n\nDemons players enjoy time with fans at Princes Park. (Getty: Kelly Defina)\n\nMoore added they wanted to help drive current fans of the men's competition to the women's games.\n\nHowever, when the women's fixture came out, in lieu of double-headers, flexible timing was built into the crossover period to ensure a club's men's and women's sides would not play at the exact same time.\n\nCategory-one venues Adelaide Oval\n\nDocklands\n\nMCG\n\nPerth Stadium Category-two venues York Park\n\nBellerive Oval\n\nGabba\n\nManuka Oval\n\nCarrara\n\nKardinia Park\n\nSydney Showground\n\nSCG\n\nAFLPA interim chief executive Ben Smith said the union provided the AFL with a submission based on player feedback that included a desire for more \"category-one venues and the opportunity to play some double-headers\".\n\nLast season, Richmond star Grace Egan told The Age: \"I don't think I've talked to a girl that hasn't loved it (the idea of a double-header).\"\n\nPlayers have also consistently advocated for some marquee games to be played at larger stadiums after the league moved away from their use to prioritise suburban grounds.\n\nThe benefits include they are weather protected, particularly out of the wind, have better surfaces free from hard and soft patches, and greater amenities for fans, such as public transport access.\n\nMoreover, these grounds also have camera cabling in much better positions, which can elevate the broadcast quality.\n\nEssendon and Hawthorn's inaugural 2022 clash at Docklands attracted 12,092 spectators, yet just 3,778 when the clubs played each other in Frankston the following year.\n\nIn the same vein, the first Showdown in 2022 between the Crows and Power attracted over 20,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval.

We know it's a really hard prospect to put the fixtures together [and] the AFL haven't ruled out double-headers into the future,\" Zell said.\n\n\"We just think it was a missed opportunity, particularly in our market, to do it this year, to really capitalise on the fact that we're coming back into the men's season.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(ABC News: Johanna Marie)\n\n\"It shifts the responsibility for monitoring and containing it more onto industry and individual businesses than it does on government departments,\" Ms Watson said.\n\nShe urged home gardeners to take part in the biosecurity effort and learn what to look for in their own vegetable patches.\n\n\"It can be found in backyard gardens and a lot of people don't realise the huge risk that it can have to our commercial producers, which may be just down the road from them,\" she said.\n\n\"They should be checking their plants regularly for anything that's showing signs of disease.\"\n\nChillies are also susceptible to the disease.

(ABC Rural: Andrew Chounding)\n\nIn 2023, Australia sent more than 530,000 kilograms of tomatoes to New Zealand.\n\nWhile exports account for only a small portion of sales compared to the $500 million domestic market, Ms Watson said it was a vital avenue for growers who had access to it.\n\n\"We need to make sure they've got a few options on the table of different customers that they can sell to,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement, New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries said: \"We are closely monitoring the situation in Australia and if there is any significant change in distribution, or which crops it (ToBRFV) is affecting, we will review the current import rules.\"\n\n\"Although Australia has announced they will no longer be pursuing eradication, all of the controls that have been in place to limit spread of the virus remain.\"",

The Indian batting star finished with 700 runs in 16 matches this season \u2014 third in the highest run-scorers' list.\n\nKohli put on vital partnerships with Mayank Agarwal (24) and skipper Rajat Patidar (26) as their cameos kept the scorecard ticking along.\n\nAzmatullah Omarzai got the vital wicket and sent Kohli back to the sheds, while Jamieson picked up his second by trapping Patidar lbw.\n\nJitesh Sharma then provided the acceleration \u2014 hitting two sixes and two fours to score 24 off 10 balls, while Liam Livingstone also hit two sixes in 25 off 15 balls.\n\nFrom 4-131 in 14.5 overs, it was just enough to push Bengaluru past 190.\n\nVirat Kohli kisses the IPL trophy as the team celebrates its drought-breaking victory.\n\nIn reply, Punjab started well as Priyansh Arya (24) and Prabhsimran Singh (26) put on 43 off 30 balls.\n\nPhil Salt took a smart catch hopping across the boundary to send back Arya and then Pandya struck after the powerplay.\n\nFirst he sent back Prabhsimran, who was crawling despite a dropped catch earlier on.\n\nThe turning point came in the 10th over as Shreyas Iyer was caught behind for one off Romario Shepherd.\n\nAustralia's Josh Inglis scored 39 off 23 balls, including four sixes, but he holed out off Pandya in the 13th over in another body blow for the Kings' chase.\n\nFellow Australian Josh Hazlewood struggled, taking 1-54 from his four overs, but he defended the 29 needed from his final over.\n\nShashank Singh stayed put, scoring 61 not out off 30 balls, including six sixes but it only reduced the margin of victory.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "\u201cWe know that if you leave people waiting for treatment, they are less likely to take up the opportunity of treatment when it\u2019s presented to them, and also that their symptoms can deteriorate,\u201d she says. There is no official data in Australia on the length or number of people on waitlists, but a 2020 report from The Butterfly Foundation identified waiting times as a key issue for respondents. Helplines, such as the Butterfly Foundation\u2019s free national helpline, have long helped fill this gap for eating disorder patients. But Sharp says the prospect of calling someone can be daunting for some patients. \u201cSome people really love helplines. But there are other people who would never choose to use a helpline. It\u2019s about giving them an option for engaging with treatment that we know is evidence-based and effective,\u201d she says. ESSI provided one 30-minute session to 60 patients around Australia on waitlists for eating disorder treatment. The chatbot is not designed to replace treatment for patients, but to provide interim support while they wait for care. The information discussed by the patient with the chatbot is then passed on to the patient\u2019s clinician.\n\nWhile one half-hour session may not seem like much, Sharp says it can still have a powerful effect. \u201cSingle Session Interventions are considered a newer innovation, particularly in mental health care, showing that even a small dose of therapy can be very beneficial and start to change some of those unhelpful thoughts and behaviours,\u201d she says. A screenshot from the Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention chatbot developed by Professor Gemma Sharp. Credit: Courtesy of Professor Gemma Sharp Sharp\u2019s team recorded participants\u2019 experiences at four points \u2013 before using the chatbot, after 72 hours, after one month and after three months. The results of the randomised controlled trial were published late last month in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Almost 100 per cent of patients who used the chatbot went on to start treatment, and had significantly improved outcomes like reduced eating disorder symptoms, depression and anxiety at one and three months.\n\nThe trial\u2019s 12-month results, which are yet to be published, followed a similar trajectory according to Sharp. For Kelly, her experience with ESSI almost two years ago, helped her feel seen for the first time, and set her on the path to recovery. \u201cIt was me almost like talking to myself and figuring stuff out by myself, but with some tools, and there wasn\u2019t any judgment,\u201d she says. The chatbot also helped lead her to an autism diagnosis, which she says is connected to some of her sensory food issues and ARFID diagnosis. When she was finally able to see her clinician, they had all the information they needed to treat her. \u201cTo be finally validated, I think that was the biggest thing for me... it was being able to see my own words reflected back to me, and then to go into a session and actually be heard and seen for who I am,\u201d she says.\n\nProfessor Gemma Sharpe. Credit: Ben Searcy While the study was relatively small, it joins a growing body of international research on the potential uses of artificial intelligence in supporting eating disorder diagnosis, treatment and recovery. Loading Dr Sarah Barakat, a postdoctoral research associate at the InsideOut Institute for Eating Disorders, who was not involved in the study, says Sharp\u2019s findings are in line with her own research into digital interventions. \u201cThere is a real role for these technologies, and they can be really helpful, particularly in a space like eating disorders where there\u2019s quite a lot of shame and ambivalence around seeking help,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile she emphasises that chatbots like ESSI need to be integrated with human-led care, such technologies can help eliminate certain biases clinicians may hold in the pre-screening stage. \u201cIt is a problem in the healthcare system that clinicians don\u2019t receive enough training around how to screen and treat eating disorders.\u201d \u201cAnd that means that particularly for people who struggle with binge-eating disorders, who might be in normal or larger bodies, thinking to screen those people for an eating disorder is quite uncommon.\u201d Then there are ethical concerns that can arise from using AI in healthcare. In 2023, a chatbot promoted by the United States\u2019 National Eating Disorders Association sparked concern about the use of AI when it offered dieting advice to a patient.",

        "text": "Canada, which achieved GDP growth of 1.5 per cent last year, is expected to post growth of only 1 per cent this year and something similar in 2026. Mexico, after also growing its economy 1.5 per ent last year, is expected to slow to 0.4 per cent growth this year before recovering somewhat to a growth rate of 1.1 per cent in 2026. Australia, which had GDP growth of 1.1 per cent last year, has forecast growth of 1.8 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2026. Xi Jinping has led a sophisticated response from China to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Credit: AP The prime target of the US assault on global trade, China, is expected to be affected negatively, but to a significantly lesser extent than the US. Its economy grew 5 per cent last year, is expected to slow to 4.7 per cent growth this year and 4.3 per cent in 2026. In other words, China is expected to lose about 70 basis points of growth over two years, but the US 130 basis points.\n\nLoading There is uncertainty surrounding what the eventual outcome on tariffs might be, but it is near-certain that the current settings are only a baseline case and that, with Trump determined to implement his tariffs one way or another, the likely outcome will be more damaging to global trade and growth - and to the US and other economies - than the OECD numbers suggest. There\u2019s also uncertainty relating to retaliatory measures by those countries hit by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The European Union, which responded to the steel and aluminium tariffs (where the 50 per cent rate cuts in today) with retaliatory tariffs of its own, has a long and lengthening list of prospective US targets for more tariffs if Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs on top of the baseline 10 per cent duties. China and the US agreed to a pause in their trade confrontation that left the US reducing its tariffs on imports from China from 145 per cent to 30 per cent and China its retaliatory tariffs from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.\n\nMore threatening than China\u2019s tariffs, however, are its controls over exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets, where it dominates the global supply chains. It has effectively shut down almost all exports of the strategic metals, which are essential for the manufacturing of automobiles, aeroplanes, semiconductors, robots, wind turbines and a host of other advanced manufactures, including military hardware. That, if it continues, will be highly disruptive to global supply chains and highly damaging to advanced economies, most particularly the US economy. Last month a Ford plant in the US had to cease operations because of a shortage of rare earth magnets. That\u2019s a small preview of what might be to come for US manufacturers if their administration continues its ill-conceived crusade against global trade.\n\nChina\u2019s asymmetric response to the Trump tariffs reflects the sophistication of its response. Employing its near-monopoly over rare earths does minimal damage to China\u2019s economy but could bring US advanced manufacturing to a standstill. It would take years, probably decades, for the US to develop sufficient alternative sources of supply to eliminate its dependence on China for those specialised metals. The OECD\u2019s forecasts are likely to prove conservative. Other economies being threatened with punitive reciprocal tariffs unless they reduce trade barriers, remake their tax systems and succumb to Trump\u2019s directives on their social policies will no doubt be looking for asymmetrical responses of their own. The EU, for instance, is eyeing off the big US tech and social media companies. In normal circumstances, the abrupt slowdown in US growth depicted by the OECD would produce a response from the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nConfronted by such a rapid and significant loss of economic momentum, the Fed would cut interest rates and, if the outlook were deemed significantly dire, restart its quantitative easing program, buying bonds and other securities to suppress market interest rates and pump liquidity and credit into the financial system. Loading The OECD, however, is forecasting a US inflation rate that will rise from its current level of around 2.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent by the end of this year, before falling back next year as the economy slows. If that were to transpire, the Fed won\u2019t be cutting US rates this year and might well be raising them. Having been burned by the surge in post-pandemic inflation, which it thought was transient, it won\u2019t risk making the same mistake again, which may well exacerbate the extent of the US slowdown. The OECD\u2019s forecasts underscore that this remarkably stupid trade war, initiated by a president who doesn\u2019t understand trade and whose policymaking appears uninformed by any serious analysis of the consequences, will do significant damage to the global economy for no near-term economic gain but plenty of economic pain for the economy that has initiated it.",

I made new friends, and I started watching basketball twice a week, watching the EuroLeague. So it was actually good fun. \u201cIf I had to decide, I would not get injured, but getting injured, at least I made it worthwhile. You\u2019ve got to take it on the chin, focus on yourself, become a better athlete \u2013 which I think I\u2019ve become.\u201d Alessandro Circati. Credit: Getty Images When Circati began on his road to recovery, the staff at the rehab centre he attended in Bologna asked him: what\u2019s your goal? His answer was twofold: make it back onto the pitch before the end of the Serie A season, and be fit for the Socceroos\u2019 crucial June window to help them clinch World Cup qualification. That was doubly important because Thursday night\u2019s clash with Japan \u2013 in which a win would seal a spot at the 2026 World Cup for Australia \u2013 is at Optus Stadium in Perth, his hometown. Though he wasn\u2019t born there, that\u2019s where he grew up; his father Gianfranco moved to Perth in 1998 to play for the Glory in the old National Soccer League, and while he only spent a season with them, he loved it so much he migrated permanently eight years later.\n\nCircati has ticked both boxes. At club level, his return was initially being handled with caution, with the 22-year-old an unused substitute for six games once he was deemed fit enough to make a match-day squad \u2013 until a string of results below them on the Serie A table put Parma at heightened relegation risk, forcing them to break glass in case of emergency for their final two fixtures, and bring in a player who has been dubbed \u201cthe wall of Parma\u201d by Italian media. \u2018My dream was to play in Serie A, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done it yet.\u2019 Alessandro Circati \u201cThat\u2019s when things started to change,\u201d Circati said. \u201cThe coach came up to me, and he goes, \u2018How much are you able to play?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth games were pivotal, and Circati was pivotal in them. Against Napoli, he drew a foul deep in stoppage time from Giovanni Simeone which saw a penalty awarded against Parma in the same passage of play overturned. It finished 0-0, meaning the eventual Italian champions had to wait to be crowned. \u201cIt\u2019s also worse when they celebrate in your home stadium, so that\u2019s what we didn\u2019t want,\u201d Circati said. \u201cIt felt good to deny them.\u201d Alessandro Circati celebrates Parma\u2019s safety after a 3-2 comeback win away to Atalanta. Credit: Getty Images In Parma\u2019s final game, away to Atalanta, was more \u201chectic\u201d, in his words. Stung by two counter-attacking goals despite largely controlling the game, Parma were 2-0 down at half-time, and needed a draw from the match to confirm their safety in the top league. \u201cWe went into the change rooms at half-time \u2026 we looked at ourselves in the eyes, and we said we\u2019re gonna come back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo goals, very doable. We went out, we took it goal by goal. We weren\u2019t too worked up. The first one led to the second, and then the second led to the third, and then there you go. It\u2019s probably the best comeback I\u2019ve actually been a part of in my life in football. I\u2019ve never come back from 2-0 down and won 3-2. Big satisfaction.\u201d His deployment was a vote of major confidence from manager Cristian Chivu, who replaced Fabio Pecchia \u2013 the coach who oversaw Circati\u2019s first-team integration as they won Serie B last season \u2013 in February. \u201cWhen the coach changed, obviously, it gives you a bit of self-doubt,\u201d Circati said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who you are, I\u2019m out until the back end of the season \u2026 but hats off to Chivu because he knew who I was, he watched previous games, and he welcomed me with two arms open.\u201d Pecchia had handed Circati a start in Parma\u2019s first four games of the season, before he went down with the ACL \u2013 the highlight of which was a 2-1 win at home over another Italian giant, AC Milan. That\u2019s the team his family supports. \u201cI had my uncle in the grandstand with an AC Milan scarf on,\u201d he said. \u201cI flipped him off. When the final whistle blew, it was one of my happiest moments to this day. Huge sense of relief, where we can belong \u2013 we belong in that league.\u201d\n\nThe Socceroos also changed coach during Circati\u2019s injury lay-off, but to one he was familiar with: Tony Popovic (and his assistant Hayden Foxe) was at Perth Glory when he was a youth player before he departed for Italy. Popovic\u2019s initial plan was to leave him out for this squad \u2013 Circati would have checked into camp anyway and watched the Japan game from the stands on his off-season trip home \u2013 but given how good he looked for Parma, it was a no-brainer to bring him in and stiffen up his back three, which is weakened in the absence of Harry Souttar and Hayden Matthews through injury. Alessandro Circati. Credit: SMH There is huge transfer interest in Circati from Juventus and Napoli, as well as clubs in the English Premier League, but he is happy at Parma, and happier still that he is such a big part of their plans. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be wanted than unwanted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s great hearing big clubs want you, and that Parma aren\u2019t really willing to sell you, the president doesn\u2019t want to sell. It\u2019s a good situation, you feel like you\u2019re wanted. This season coming, I can almost say I\u2019ll be 100 per cent playing at Parma because I just think that\u2019s the right decision to do at this point, just to be able to play a whole season. Loading \u201cMy dream was to play in Serie A, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done it yet. I want to play a whole season, lots of games, enjoy it. For me, it was even a bigger motivator to stay up.\u201d But that\u2019s for next season. Top of his footballing bucket list right now is to help the Socceroos get to the 2026 World Cup, and then play a big role in it. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ambition, a big dream, but that is my goal.\u201d",

        "text": "Have you ever noticed how some people bounce out of bed after just a few hours of sleep, while others can barely function without a solid eight hours?\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Margaret Thatcher, for example. The former British prime minister was known for sleeping just four hours a night.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe worked late, rose early, and seemed to thrive on little sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for most of us, that kind of sleep schedule would be disastrous.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd be groggy, unfocused, and reaching for sugary snacks and caffeinated drinks by mid-morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why do some people seem to need less sleep than others?\n\n\n\nIt's a question that has fascinated scientists for years. Here's what we know.\n\n\n\nNatural short sleepers\n\nThere is a small group of people who don't need much sleep. We call them natural short sleepers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can function perfectly well on just four to six hours of sleep each night, often for their entire lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, they don't feel tired, they don't nap, and they don't suffer the usual negative consequences of sleep deprivation.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists call this the natural short sleep phenotype \u2014 a biological trait that allows people to get all the benefits of sleep in less time.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, researchers discovered genetic mutations that help explain this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural short sleepers carry rare variants in certain genes, which seem to make their sleep more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore recently, a 2025 study assessed a woman in her 70s with one of these rare mutations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite sleeping just six hours a night for most of her life, she remained physically healthy, mentally sharp, and led a full, active life.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer body, it seems, was simply wired to need less sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're still learning about how common these genetic mutations are and why they occur.\n\n\n\nNot everyone who sleeps less is a natural short sleeper\n\nBut here's the catch: most people who think they're natural short sleepers aren't.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're just chronically sleep-deprived.\n\n\n\n\n\nOften, their short sleep is due to long work hours, social commitments, or a belief sleeping less is a sign of strength or productivity.\n\n\n\nFor the average person, it's not sustainable to only get a few hours sleep a night. Source: Getty / Carol Yepes In today's hustle culture, it's common to hear people boast about getting by on only a few hours of sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for the average person, that's not sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effects of short sleep build up over time, creating what\u2019s known as a 'sleep debt'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can lead to poor concentration, mood swings, micro-sleeps (brief lapses into sleep), reduced performance and even long-term health risks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, short sleep has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke).\n\n\n\nThe weekend catch-up dilemma\n\nTo make up for lost sleep during the week, many people try to 'catch up' on weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can help repay some of the sleep debt that has accumulated in the short term.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch suggests getting one to two extra hours of sleep on the weekend or taking naps when possible may help reduce the negative effects of short sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it's not a perfect fix. Weekend catch-up sleep and naps may not fully resolve sleep debt. The topic remains one of ongoing scientific debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent large study suggested weekend catch-up sleep may not offset the cardiovascular risks associated with chronic short sleep.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is it harmful to look at your phone first thing in the morning?\n\nWhat's more, large swings in sleep timing can disrupt your body's internal clock, and sleeping in too much on weekends may make it harder to fall asleep on Sunday night, which can mean starting the working week less rested.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing evidence indicates repeated cycles of irregular sleep may have an important influence on general health and the risk of early death, potentially even more so than how long we sleep for.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, while moderate catch-up sleep might offer some benefits, it's no substitute for consistent, high-quality sleep throughout the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, maintaining such regularity can be particularly challenging for people with non-traditional schedules, such as shift workers.\n\n\n\nSo, was Thatcher a true natural short sleeper?\n\nIt's hard to say. Some reports suggest she napped during the day in the back of a car between meetings. That could mean she was simply sleep-deprived and compensating for an accumulated sleep debt when she could.\n\n\n\nSeparate from whether someone is a natural short sleeper, there are a range of other reasons people may need more or less sleep than others.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors such as age and underlying health conditions can significantly influence sleep requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, older adults often experience changes in their circadian rhythms and are more likely to suffer from fragmented sleep due to conditions such as arthritis or cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep needs vary from person to person, and while a lucky few can thrive on less, most of us need seven to nine hours of sleep a night to feel and function at our best.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're regularly skimping on sleep and relying on weekends to catch up, it might be time to rethink your routine. After all, sleep isn't a luxury \u2014 it's a biological necessity.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This article contains references to suicide and self-harm.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of seven, Max was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome , a lifelong neurological condition characterised by repetitive, involuntary movements and sounds known as tics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMax experienced bullying at school, leading them to drop out before the end of Year 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pretty much overnight, my tics went from, I was able to hide them, to not being able to hide them. It was full-blown swearing, punching out,\" Max said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMax said they have multiple self-injurious tics, including one where they repeatedly hit their eye. They dislocated and broke their elbow last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow 18, Max wishes to work or volunteer at an animal shelter, but isn't able to as employers believe their tics will frighten animals.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Measuring the hidden burden of Tourette Syndrome and tic disorders on Australia SBS News 31/05/2025 06:26 Play\n\nMelissa Licari, a senior research fellow at The Kids Research Institute Australia, said such experiences have severely affected Max's mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tourette's took more than just the control of Max's body. It has profoundly impacted mental health,\" Licari said. \"Max's mum has lost count of the number of suicide attempts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVicky, Max's mother, said Max's mental health has deteriorated significantly over the last couple of years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't believe that they want to die. They just don't want to live like this,\" she said, in a video posted by The Kids Research Institute Australia this week.\n\n\n\nMax (left) was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome when they were seven years old. Source: Supplied In Australia, one in every 100 school-aged children lives with Tourette syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicari said Max's story reflects the ongoing challenges that young Australians living with the condition have been facing, including long waits for diagnosis, limited access to effective treatment, stigma and discrimination, and limited understanding and support in schools and workplaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This sadly results in severe mental health issues. These challenges aren't new and they've been ignored for far too long,\" Licari said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicari is a co-author of Impact for Tourette, Australia's first survey of its kind in Australia, looking at the mental health of people living with Tourette syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt interviewed more than 200 persons and caregivers, finding that almost half of the children with tics showed signs of depression, and nearly half of the caregivers said their child had expressed suicidal thoughts. One in 10 has attempted to take their own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 70 per cent of adults had thought about ending their lives. One in four adults had attempted suicide \u2014 five times higher than the national average.\n\n\n\nMelissa Licari said Australians living with Tourette syndrome face ongoing challenges, including long waits for diagnosis, limited access to treatment, stigma and discrimination. Source: Supplied The report includes seven key recommendations, including funding to develop a National Clinical Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tic disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Maxwell is a clinical psychologist and clinical research manager at the UNSW Tic Clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said a lack of psychological services has pushed people to seek medication to treat tic-related disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Medication can be very helpful, but of the sample that we surveyed, 50 per cent said that it did not control their tics or minimally controlled their tics. And there are obvious side effects as well with some of the medications,\" she said.\n\n\n\nVicky said she believed a diagnosis had limited impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like, 'Well, your child's got Tourette's. We'll try this medication', and the medication doesn't particularly work. And it's like, what now? 'Oh, well, there's nothing else. That's it',\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell said more than 80 per cent of those with Tourette syndrome who were surveyed said they experienced tics daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"About 50 per cent of the children reported that they didn't have tic-free periods of more than five to 10 minutes in a day,\" she said.\n\n\n\nSignificant financial toll\n\nWith those symptoms, many living with the condition are unlikely to be able to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to Maxwell, they're also struggling to get NDIS applications approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The financial burden is great. It's not just because some adults are unable to work, but there is also a significant cost of accessing healthcare for these young people. One in 20 had NDIS funding. Three out of four had their applications denied,\" she said.\n\n\n\nMaxwell said in her experience, young people were denied NDIS support because tic disorders were not considered a 'permanent' disability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yet even adults we work with \u2014 that clearly have tics that have persisted into adulthood and that experiencing significant functional impairment \u2014 are also being told that their disability is not a permanent disability and denied funding,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Valsamma Eapen is scientia professor and chair of child psychiatry at UNSW Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said while a comprehensive care plan is required to look after people living with tics, sometimes, even health professionals don't have much awareness of what's needed to support their patients.\n\n\n\n\"GPs are usually the first stop, but it could also be paediatrics in neurology, psychology, and some will go to the eye specialist if the fast tic is blinking or screwing of the eye, or ENT specialist when they have a vocal tic like grunting or throat-clearing and so on. But often it's not picked up as tics or Tourette,\" Eapen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No-one believes me,\" Max said. \"No doctors, no nurses, no psychiatrists. No-one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found one in four people waited more than two years for a diagnosis, and one-third were not offered any services or support after diagnosis. Only 40 per cent said their experience with treatment was positive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also found there is a shortage of psychologists with the expertise to offer treatment for tic disorders.\n\n\n\nValsamma Eapen says it's critical that a national guideline be established for tics and Tourette syndrome, so there can be a standardised approach to early identification, assessment, and appropriate support. Source: Supplied Eapen said more understanding is critical, and there were several unhelpful views about tics and Tourette syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose included the assumption that people would \"grow out of\" it. Another is the understanding of Tourette solely as \"the swearing syndrome where people blurt out obscenities\", leading to some people not being believed about having the syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Neither is a helpful approach because the majority would fall somewhere in between,\" Eapen said.\n\n\n\n'Indeed a human rights issue'\n\nEapen said more training for professionals was needed, urging the government to launch a national guideline on Tourette syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A national guideline will provide uniform minimum standards and a consistent approach that's agreed upon by all consumer stakeholders and professionals as to the framework, to awareness, early identification, comprehensive assessment, and also matching supports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That should also include accommodations at school and for disability supports, where it is applicable. It is indeed a human rights issue for the 55,000 Australians who are living with Tourette's.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, Vicky said she has hope Max will \"remember who they were and what brought them joy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking crisis support can ring Lifeline on 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged up to 25).

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAs federal cabinet meets in Perth, the fallout from Western Australian senator Dorinda Cox's shock defection from the Greens to the Labor Party continues.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters says she was left stunned by the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dorinda called about an hour before her press conference with the Prime Minister and we had a very calm and measured conversation about it. I did genuinely wish her all the best, there's no animosity there, it is obviously disappointing to lose a Greens senator.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens still hold the balance of power in the Senate, but Ms Cox says she wasn't able to achieve the progress she desires with the party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've reached a conclusion after deep and careful reflection that My values and priorities are more aligned with Labor than the Greens. I am in public life to make real change, and deliver lasting and tangible outcomes for Australians. I've worked hard to make Australia fairer and much more reconciled. But recently, I've lost confidence in the capacity for the Greens to be able to assist me in being able to progress this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, just last week, Ms Cox condemned Labor's extension of Western Australia's controversial North-West Shelf gas project.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been labelled by the Greens as a carbon bomb, and Ms Cox raised concerns ancient Indigenous heritage would be destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says joining the Labor Party will mean making some compromises for Ms Cox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dorinda Cox understands that being a member of the Labor Party means that she will support positions that are made by the Labor Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a lesson that was learned the hard way for fellow West Australian Senator Fatima Payman, who left Labor's ranks last year after speaking out on Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens staffers suggest Ms Cox left voluntarily before she was pushed out, amid internal investigations into bullying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're claims the senator has denied, and Mr Albanese says he's confident any issues have been managed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, that got dealt with by the mechanism that my government established. We support safe workplaces. We established a mechanism in the parliament which is at arm\u2019s length of government, and that's important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens have now been left with no Indigenous members among their federal ranks, after Lidia Thorpe left in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Cox says she lost faith her party could help her make real change on issues, including reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Ms Waters says she's unconvinced Labor will do better on this front- having backed down on truth and treaty.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "With Australia's housing crisis worsening, owning a house is increasingly getting out of reach for the ordinary Australian. But with their soaring wealth, the country's billionaires can comfortably own hundreds of thousands of houses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review's Rich List, released last week, reveals the total wealth of Australia's richest 200 people has surged by 160 per cent over the past decade, reaching $667.8 billion in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopping the list for the sixth year in a row was mining magnate Gina Rinehart, with an estimated net worth of $38.1 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stark contrast, the median personal income stands at just $55,062 a year, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why you might need to move out of capital cities for a rental bargain\n\nAnti-poverty organisation Oxfam says property has been the most frequent source of wealth accumulation for Australia's wealthiest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group told SBS News the wealth of the entire Rich List could buy over 680,000 average Australian homes, based on ABS's mean dwelling price of $976,800.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that divide is growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Oxfam Australia's analysis of the Rich List, the number of Australian billionaires has more than doubled over the past decade \u2014 rising from 74 in 2015 to 161 in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver that same period, billionaire wealth has grown on average by more than $137 million a day \u2014 or $95,000 every minute.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average Rich Lister has over 116,000 times the wealth of an Australian in the bottom 50 per cent.\n\n\n\nOver the last 10 years, billionaire wealth has grown on average by $95,000 every minute \u2014 more than the median Australian taxpayer earns each year. Source: SBS News\n\n'Morally wrong, economically and socially dangerous'\n\nOxfam is renewing calls for tax reform to address what it describes as \"rampant inequality\" and ensure the ultra-wealthy contribute their fair share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any billionaire is a sign that our economic system isn't working properly,\" Oxfam Australia acting chief Chrisanta Muli told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This level of inequality is not just morally wrong \u2014 it's economically and socially dangerous. While millions of Australians are struggling to make ends meet, the country\u2019s richest continue to amass eye-watering fortunes, often without lifting a finger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Millions of households struggle to put food on the table while the super-rich live in excess.\"\n\n\n\nOxfam's analysis found the average wealth of someone in the bottom 50 per cent of the population has flatlined at around $28,000 over the past decade, offering little chance of home ownership or long-term financial security.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said on the other hand, Australia's largest property developer, Harry Triguboff who is the second-richest Australian on the AFR Rich List, has seen his personal wealth more than double \u2014 from $13.7 billion in 2016 to $29.7 billion in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Oxfam, that amount could buy more than 30,000 average Australian homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail, investments and mining/resources were behind property as the most frequent source of wealth accumulation for Australia's richest in the past decade.\n\n\n\nThe rise of housing unaffordability \u2014 and billionaire wealth\n\nOxfam points out that the boom in personal wealth has coincided with a worsening housing crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Anglicare Australia's 2025 Rental Affordability Snapshot:\n\n\n\nOnly 0.7 per cent of rental listings are affordable for someone earning a full-time minimum wage.\n\nJust 12.8 per cent rental properties are affordable for a family of four on two minimum wage incomes.\n\nFor people on JobSeeker, the Disability Support Pension, or the Age Pension, affordable rentals are virtually nonexistent.\n\n\"It is scandalous and unjust that property continues to be one of the biggest drivers of wealth across the decade while over 99 per cent of rentals are unaffordable for people earning a full-time minimum wage,\" Muli said.\n\n\n\nThe Anglicare Snapshot surveyed 51,238 rental listings across Australia, revealing that just 0.7 per cent of rentals were affordable for someone earning a full-time minimum wage. Source: SBS News Meanwhile, the 2024 PropTrack Housing Affordability Report found housing affordability to be at a record low \u2014 with a typical household earning a combined income of $112,000 a year, able to afford just 14 per cent of all homes sold across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir analysis showed that you now need to be a high-income household, classified as earning $213,000 a year, to be able to afford to buy half the homes sold in Australia over that year.\n\n\n\nOxfam calls to tax the rich\n\nThe organisation is calling on the federal government to conduct a comprehensive review of the tax system to better address wealth accumulation by the super-rich and close what it sees as a failure of the progressive tax system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're proposing a wealth tax targeting the richest one per cent, which is believed could raise tens of billions of dollars annually and contribute to healthcare, affordable housing and action on climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Billionaires pay an effective tax rate of around 0.3 per cent of their wealth globally. Because billionaires grow their wealth through assets, not incomes, the income tax system is failing to properly tax them,\" Muli said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nirvana plays 'Where did you sleep last night')\n\n\n\n\n\nAn iconic performance from a band that defined a generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNirvana's MTV Unplugged performance in November of 1993 captured the band at the height of their powers, just five months before iconic singer-songwriter Kurt Cobain took his own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nKurt's Martin D-18E Electro-Acoustic guitar, used during the famous moment, is now the centrepiece for a new exhibition at London's Royal College of Music.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 302 of this model were ever made, and the singer-songwriter bought his second-hand from a guitar shop in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoments before playing the song 'Where did you sleep last night', first popularised by legendary blues player Lead Belly, Cobain joked about wanting to purchase the musician's guitar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for $500,000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading rock journalist Alan di Perna says there's some irony to this comment now given the current value of the very guitar Cobain was playing that evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction: $6.1 million. It's significant because Kurt owned it. Kurt played it. It's the last guitar he ever played. It was used in the final phase of his career. It was used for the Unplugged program, which was taped 5 months or so before Kurt Cobain passed away. So for fans it's an iconic object.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKurt Cobain and his band Nirvana pioneered the grunge movement of the late 80s and early 90s, combining introspective verses with clean sounds, and rocky, distorted choruses.\n\n\n\n\n\nNirvana produced three studio albums: Bleached, Nevermind and In Utero.\n\n\n\n\n\nCobain is often considered one of the key voices of his generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's very influential for songs that sum up the anxieties of Generation X, his generation. He once commented that 'I'm just like my fans'. He comes from a broken home, a somewhat impoverished background, and all of this is reflected in his songwriting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green mohair cardigan Kurt Cobain wore for the 1993 MTV performance is also on display.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Unplugged cemented them as one of the top musical acts of their time, the band came to a sudden and tragic end, when in April 1994, Cobain died by suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being active for just a few short years of fame, Nirvana has continued to inspire an army of loyal fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The big part of Kurt Cobain's enduring popularity is of course his tragic early death, there's no getting around that. And he's sort of one of the great martyrs of rock and roll, one of the great martyrs to fame. I think people identify with that. He's also a member of the so-called '27 club', rock stars who died at age 27: Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, I believe. There's something about that age and it tends to make people immortal in the memory of the public.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first time the Royal College of Music in London has hosted an exhibition on rock, normally sticking to more classical genres.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne fan will also walk away with a piece of Nirvana memorabilia as the college are raffling a guitar pick once used by Kurt Cobain, for five British pounds a ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the students that attend this institution, curator Gabriele Rossi Rognoni believes there is something to learn from the late musician.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We saw space to develop a story that was not only about an instrument but about a person with a complex background and with something that is quite significant today, which is as musicians and as public figures, you are under a lot of pressure. And this pressure can play out in different ways in life. And having the possibility to open this discussion clearly and working with someone who had had such an incredible public success but at the same time such a complex personal experience.\"\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / James Ross \"The very worst thing for small businesses is if workers' wages go backwards, it means they have to cut back,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It might be the coffee, it might be the sandwich, it might be a beer... You can't cut out your rent, can't cut out your bills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke Achterstraat, CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, said business owners would wear the brunt of the wage increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today\u2019s decision of a 3.5 per cent increase \u2014 which is above the current rate of inflation \u2014 will have ramifications for our small business engine room, many of whom are struggling to make a profit on already razor-thin margins,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many owners will need to personally absorb these higher costs, unable to pass on any further price rises to consumers.\"\n\n\n\nLabor backed an increase above inflation , which was 2.4 per cent at the end of March.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese reassured Australians that the wage rise shouldn't drive up prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, what it will make sure is that people won't fall behind when it comes to cost of living,\" he told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the FWC increased award wages by 3.75 per cent, just below annual inflation at 3.8 per cent.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cWe know that if you leave people waiting for treatment, they are less likely to take up the opportunity of treatment when it\u2019s presented to them, and also that their symptoms can deteriorate,\u201d she says. There is no official data in Australia on the length or number of people on waitlists, but a 2020 report from The Butterfly Foundation identified waiting times as a key issue for respondents. Helplines, such as the Butterfly Foundation\u2019s free national helpline, have long helped fill this gap for eating disorder patients. But Sharp says the prospect of calling someone can be daunting for some patients. \u201cSome people really love helplines. But there are other people who would never choose to use a helpline. It\u2019s about giving them an option for engaging with treatment that we know is evidence-based and effective,\u201d she says. ESSI provided one 30-minute session to 60 patients around Australia on waitlists for eating disorder treatment. The chatbot is not designed to replace treatment for patients, but to provide interim support while they wait for care. The information discussed by the patient with the chatbot is then passed on to the patient\u2019s clinician.\n\nWhile one half-hour session may not seem like much, Sharp says it can still have a powerful effect. \u201cSingle Session Interventions are considered a newer innovation, particularly in mental health care, showing that even a small dose of therapy can be very beneficial and start to change some of those unhelpful thoughts and behaviours,\u201d she says. A screenshot from the Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention chatbot developed by Professor Gemma Sharp. Credit: Courtesy of Professor Gemma Sharp Sharp\u2019s team recorded participants\u2019 experiences at four points \u2013 before using the chatbot, after 72 hours, after one month and after three months. The results of the randomised controlled trial were published late last month in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Almost 100 per cent of patients who used the chatbot went on to start treatment, and had significantly improved outcomes like reduced eating disorder symptoms, depression and anxiety at one and three months.\n\nThe trial\u2019s 12-month results, which are yet to be published, followed a similar trajectory according to Sharp. For Kelly, her experience with ESSI almost two years ago, helped her feel seen for the first time, and set her on the path to recovery. \u201cIt was me almost like talking to myself and figuring stuff out by myself, but with some tools, and there wasn\u2019t any judgment,\u201d she says. The chatbot also helped lead her to an autism diagnosis, which she says is connected to some of her sensory food issues and ARFID diagnosis. When she was finally able to see her clinician, they had all the information they needed to treat her. \u201cTo be finally validated, I think that was the biggest thing for me... it was being able to see my own words reflected back to me, and then to go into a session and actually be heard and seen for who I am,\u201d she says.\n\nProfessor Gemma Sharpe. Credit: Ben Searcy While the study was relatively small, it joins a growing body of international research on the potential uses of artificial intelligence in supporting eating disorder diagnosis, treatment and recovery. Loading Dr Sarah Barakat, a postdoctoral research associate at the InsideOut Institute for Eating Disorders, who was not involved in the study, says Sharp\u2019s findings are in line with her own research into digital interventions. \u201cThere is a real role for these technologies, and they can be really helpful, particularly in a space like eating disorders where there\u2019s quite a lot of shame and ambivalence around seeking help,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile she emphasises that chatbots like ESSI need to be integrated with human-led care, such technologies can help eliminate certain biases clinicians may hold in the pre-screening stage. \u201cIt is a problem in the healthcare system that clinicians don\u2019t receive enough training around how to screen and treat eating disorders.\u201d \u201cAnd that means that particularly for people who struggle with binge-eating disorders, who might be in normal or larger bodies, thinking to screen those people for an eating disorder is quite uncommon.\u201d Then there are ethical concerns that can arise from using AI in healthcare. In 2023, a chatbot promoted by the United States\u2019 National Eating Disorders Association sparked concern about the use of AI when it offered dieting advice to a patient.",

        "text": "Canada, which achieved GDP growth of 1.5 per cent last year, is expected to post growth of only 1 per cent this year and something similar in 2026. Mexico, after also growing its economy 1.5 per ent last year, is expected to slow to 0.4 per cent growth this year before recovering somewhat to a growth rate of 1.1 per cent in 2026. Australia, which had GDP growth of 1.1 per cent last year, has forecast growth of 1.8 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2026. Xi Jinping has led a sophisticated response from China to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Credit: AP The prime target of the US assault on global trade, China, is expected to be affected negatively, but to a significantly lesser extent than the US. Its economy grew 5 per cent last year, is expected to slow to 4.7 per cent growth this year and 4.3 per cent in 2026. In other words, China is expected to lose about 70 basis points of growth over two years, but the US 130 basis points.\n\nLoading There is uncertainty surrounding what the eventual outcome on tariffs might be, but it is near-certain that the current settings are only a baseline case and that, with Trump determined to implement his tariffs one way or another, the likely outcome will be more damaging to global trade and growth - and to the US and other economies - than the OECD numbers suggest. There\u2019s also uncertainty relating to retaliatory measures by those countries hit by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The European Union, which responded to the steel and aluminium tariffs (where the 50 per cent rate cuts in today) with retaliatory tariffs of its own, has a long and lengthening list of prospective US targets for more tariffs if Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs on top of the baseline 10 per cent duties. China and the US agreed to a pause in their trade confrontation that left the US reducing its tariffs on imports from China from 145 per cent to 30 per cent and China its retaliatory tariffs from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.\n\nMore threatening than China\u2019s tariffs, however, are its controls over exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets, where it dominates the global supply chains. It has effectively shut down almost all exports of the strategic metals, which are essential for the manufacturing of automobiles, aeroplanes, semiconductors, robots, wind turbines and a host of other advanced manufactures, including military hardware. That, if it continues, will be highly disruptive to global supply chains and highly damaging to advanced economies, most particularly the US economy. Last month a Ford plant in the US had to cease operations because of a shortage of rare earth magnets. That\u2019s a small preview of what might be to come for US manufacturers if their administration continues its ill-conceived crusade against global trade.\n\nChina\u2019s asymmetric response to the Trump tariffs reflects the sophistication of its response. Employing its near-monopoly over rare earths does minimal damage to China\u2019s economy but could bring US advanced manufacturing to a standstill. It would take years, probably decades, for the US to develop sufficient alternative sources of supply to eliminate its dependence on China for those specialised metals. The OECD\u2019s forecasts are likely to prove conservative. Other economies being threatened with punitive reciprocal tariffs unless they reduce trade barriers, remake their tax systems and succumb to Trump\u2019s directives on their social policies will no doubt be looking for asymmetrical responses of their own. The EU, for instance, is eyeing off the big US tech and social media companies. In normal circumstances, the abrupt slowdown in US growth depicted by the OECD would produce a response from the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nConfronted by such a rapid and significant loss of economic momentum, the Fed would cut interest rates and, if the outlook were deemed significantly dire, restart its quantitative easing program, buying bonds and other securities to suppress market interest rates and pump liquidity and credit into the financial system. Loading The OECD, however, is forecasting a US inflation rate that will rise from its current level of around 2.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent by the end of this year, before falling back next year as the economy slows. If that were to transpire, the Fed won\u2019t be cutting US rates this year and might well be raising them. Having been burned by the surge in post-pandemic inflation, which it thought was transient, it won\u2019t risk making the same mistake again, which may well exacerbate the extent of the US slowdown. The OECD\u2019s forecasts underscore that this remarkably stupid trade war, initiated by a president who doesn\u2019t understand trade and whose policymaking appears uninformed by any serious analysis of the consequences, will do significant damage to the global economy for no near-term economic gain but plenty of economic pain for the economy that has initiated it.",

        "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t take things for granted. Even a single training session, I grab it with both hands. I have worked on many muscle groups which I didn\u2019t really think were so important. I worked on and understood how my body works even better than before. I made new friends, and I started watching basketball twice a week, watching the EuroLeague. So it was actually good fun. \u201cIf I had to decide, I would not get injured, but getting injured, at least I made it worthwhile. You\u2019ve got to take it on the chin, focus on yourself, become a better athlete \u2013 which I think I\u2019ve become.\u201d Alessandro Circati. Credit: Getty Images When Circati began on his road to recovery, the staff at the rehab centre he attended in Bologna asked him: what\u2019s your goal? His answer was twofold: make it back onto the pitch before the end of the Serie A season, and be fit for the Socceroos\u2019 crucial June window to help them clinch World Cup qualification. That was doubly important because Thursday night\u2019s clash with Japan \u2013 in which a win would seal a spot at the 2026 World Cup for Australia \u2013 is at Optus Stadium in Perth, his hometown. Though he wasn\u2019t born there, that\u2019s where he grew up; his father Gianfranco moved to Perth in 1998 to play for the Glory in the old National Soccer League, and while he only spent a season with them, he loved it so much he migrated permanently eight years later.\n\nCircati has ticked both boxes. At club level, his return was initially being handled with caution, with the 22-year-old an unused substitute for six games once he was deemed fit enough to make a match-day squad \u2013 until a string of results below them on the Serie A table put Parma at heightened relegation risk, forcing them to break glass in case of emergency for their final two fixtures, and bring in a player who has been dubbed \u201cthe wall of Parma\u201d by Italian media. \u2018My dream was to play in Serie A, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done it yet.\u2019 Alessandro Circati \u201cThat\u2019s when things started to change,\u201d Circati said. \u201cThe coach came up to me, and he goes, \u2018How much are you able to play?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth games were pivotal, and Circati was pivotal in them. Against Napoli, he drew a foul deep in stoppage time from Giovanni Simeone which saw a penalty awarded against Parma in the same passage of play overturned. It finished 0-0, meaning the eventual Italian champions had to wait to be crowned. \u201cIt\u2019s also worse when they celebrate in your home stadium, so that\u2019s what we didn\u2019t want,\u201d Circati said. \u201cIt felt good to deny them.\u201d Alessandro Circati celebrates Parma\u2019s safety after a 3-2 comeback win away to Atalanta. Credit: Getty Images In Parma\u2019s final game, away to Atalanta, was more \u201chectic\u201d, in his words. Stung by two counter-attacking goals despite largely controlling the game, Parma were 2-0 down at half-time, and needed a draw from the match to confirm their safety in the top league. \u201cWe went into the change rooms at half-time \u2026 we looked at ourselves in the eyes, and we said we\u2019re gonna come back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo goals, very doable. We went out, we took it goal by goal. We weren\u2019t too worked up. The first one led to the second, and then the second led to the third, and then there you go. It\u2019s probably the best comeback I\u2019ve actually been a part of in my life in football. I\u2019ve never come back from 2-0 down and won 3-2. Big satisfaction.\u201d His deployment was a vote of major confidence from manager Cristian Chivu, who replaced Fabio Pecchia \u2013 the coach who oversaw Circati\u2019s first-team integration as they won Serie B last season \u2013 in February. \u201cWhen the coach changed, obviously, it gives you a bit of self-doubt,\u201d Circati said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who you are, I\u2019m out until the back end of the season \u2026 but hats off to Chivu because he knew who I was, he watched previous games, and he welcomed me with two arms open.\u201d Pecchia had handed Circati a start in Parma\u2019s first four games of the season, before he went down with the ACL \u2013 the highlight of which was a 2-1 win at home over another Italian giant, AC Milan. That\u2019s the team his family supports. \u201cI had my uncle in the grandstand with an AC Milan scarf on,\u201d he said. \u201cI flipped him off. When the final whistle blew, it was one of my happiest moments to this day. Huge sense of relief, where we can belong \u2013 we belong in that league.\u201d\n\nThe Socceroos also changed coach during Circati\u2019s injury lay-off, but to one he was familiar with: Tony Popovic (and his assistant Hayden Foxe) was at Perth Glory when he was a youth player before he departed for Italy. Popovic\u2019s initial plan was to leave him out for this squad \u2013 Circati would have checked into camp anyway and watched the Japan game from the stands on his off-season trip home \u2013 but given how good he looked for Parma, it was a no-brainer to bring him in and stiffen up his back three, which is weakened in the absence of Harry Souttar and Hayden Matthews through injury. Alessandro Circati. Credit: SMH There is huge transfer interest in Circati from Juventus and Napoli, as well as clubs in the English Premier League, but he is happy at Parma, and happier still that he is such a big part of their plans. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be wanted than unwanted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s great hearing big clubs want you, and that Parma aren\u2019t really willing to sell you, the president doesn\u2019t want to sell. It\u2019s a good situation, you feel like you\u2019re wanted. This season coming, I can almost say I\u2019ll be 100 per cent playing at Parma because I just think that\u2019s the right decision to do at this point, just to be able to play a whole season. Loading \u201cMy dream was to play in Serie A, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done it yet. I want to play a whole season, lots of games, enjoy it. For me, it was even a bigger motivator to stay up.\u201d But that\u2019s for next season. Top of his footballing bucket list right now is to help the Socceroos get to the 2026 World Cup, and then play a big role in it. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ambition, a big dream, but that is my goal.\u201d",

Source: Getty\n\nAn Australian disability advocate is calling for better, disability-led policies and systemic reforms to ensure disabled travellers are respected, and their mobility aids are properly handled, after her wheelchair was damaged for a third time by Qantas.\n\nMelbourne woman Zoe Simmons, who lives with fibromyalgia, said she recently embarked on a round-trip to Tokyo from Melbourne with the national carrier, and when she was given back her wheelchair in Australia, it had sustained substantial damages.\n\nShe said it was handed back with warped metal, broken parts, and scratches that impacted its safety and usability. Zoe said that in 2021, a similar, though more severe incident occurred with Qantas, and again last year, though she didn't report the latter issue \u2014 the steering controller had broken off \u2014 over fears of being \"laughed off\".\n\nZoe's wheelchair was left with several structural damages after a recent flight from Tokyo to Melbourne. Source: Supplied/Zoe Simmons\n\nFollowing her recent trip to Japan, Qantas did arrange for Zoe to get her wheelchair repaired through one of its partnered repair services, but she feels it\u2019s unfair that disabled passengers have to accept this as the norm \u2014 that they\u2019re expected to handle repairs themselves whenever their mobility aids are damaged during travel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZoe said she, and hundreds of thousands around the country, remain deeply frustrated at the energy it takes disabled passengers to continually advocate for repairs and recognition, often met with indifference or excuses from airline staff. \"I just hate that it\u2019s so common, like what are they doing to our wheelchairs that causes metal to warp and break,\" Zoe told Yahoo News Australia.\n\n\"There are chunks out of the arm rests, the arm rests are very warped and are weirdly sitting now, they're also loose, the foot guard has chunks out of it, my wheel cover and my cup holder are also damaged, not to mention the scratches, and so on.\n\n\"Last time I flew with them, they broke my wheelchair controller off. And it was just laughed off! I didn\u2019t have the energy to fight for such a small thing then.\"\n\nDisability advocate Zoe Simmons is pushing for sweeping change in how Australian airlines handle disability support. Source: Supplied.\n\nMelbourne woman demands nationwide reform in airline treatment of mobility aids\n\nZoe said that after discovering damage to her wheelchair, she had to explain her story to several airport staff who mostly responded with dismissive sympathy. When a manager eventually spoke with her, Zoe raised the issue of how the burden always falls on disabled people to advocate for themselves\u2014something the manager denied, citing policies and procedures, without acknowledging how exhausting that constant advocacy is.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe criticised the way airlines treat wheelchairs like baggage instead of essential mobility aids, and called for stronger policies, better staff training, and public reporting on wheelchair damage. \"Imagine if non-disabled people expected their legs to be broken every time they flew, if chunks came off,\" she said.\n\n\"What if your bones were warped? They need to stop treating wheelchairs like baggage and start respecting them for what they are.\"\n\nZoe highlighted that in the US, some 30 wheelchairs are damaged daily during flights, according to the US Department of Transportation, which began requiring airlines to report wheelchair and scooter damage in December, 2018.\n\nSince then, monthly reports have consistently shown that an average of around 25\u201330 mobility devices are damaged each day across US domestic flights. But Australia lacks transparent recording or reporting of such incidents.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It\u2019s just frustrating to have sat in the Disability Royal Commission several years ago, and we're talking about this. While things are improving, they aren\u2019t improving fast enough,\" she said. \"We need disability-led policy and procedural reforms, and to ensure everyone has access to repairs, not just people who can be the squeaky wheel.\"\n\nIn a letter given to Zoe by Qantas, seen by Yahoo, a representative asked her to take her \"damaged bag\" to an authorised repairer. \"If this is not convenient, please forward a quote for the repair with this letter to your nearest Qantas office for review,\" it said.\n\nQantas responds to allegations\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo on Wednesday, a Qantas spokesperson \"sincerely apologised\" for the ordeal.\n\n\"We sincerely apologise to Ms Simmons for the damage caused to her wheelchair. We know how critically important mobility aids are, and we are investigating how this damage occurred,\" they said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We are working closely with Ms Simmons to ensure the repairs are facilitated as soon as possible.\"\n\nAfter Yahoo's enquiries, Zoe said Qantas reached out to her again. She said their designated repairer doesn't service her type of wheelchair. \"I then gave them the details of a repairer I know will work, but see all the hoops and onus and exhaustion here, when this stuff happens every day,\" she said\n\n\"I\u2019m not mad for myself \u2014 I am mad for every disabled person who experiences this, in whatever way that might look like,\" she said. \"I am not that angry about my chair. What I\u2019m angry about is that this is what we are expected to put up with \u2014 and much, much worse \u2014 every time we fly.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "There are calls for certain drivers to be banned from getting behind the wheel of larger vehicles and for restrictions on towing caravans and boats.\n\nThe heartbroken loved ones of a young Australian bystander who was struck down in an unimaginable \"freak\" five-car crash accident last year are pushing for urgent changes to road laws to prevent others from suffering a similar fate.\n\nZach Wilson, 27, from Little Mountain on the Sunshine Coast, happened to be working on the side of the road when a ute towing a caravan allegedly veered into oncoming traffic, striking five other vehicles in Mooloolaba on October 4. The driver of the ute was believed to have suffered an epileptic fit behind the wheel, resulting in him completely losing control.\n\nOne of the vehicles hit a parked car as a result of the impact, which was then pushed onto Zach. He was pinned beneath the vehicle for some time before being transferred to hospital, where he later died from brain injuries. Zach, a council garden worker, had recently become engaged to his partner Lucy, who is spearheading the calls for change.\n\nZach Wilson died after a driver towing a caravan suffered a medical episode behind the wheel and crashed into five other vehicles, one of which struck him. Source: ACA\n\nHeartbroken family's plea after unimaginable tragedy\n\nLucy, along with her mother Jodie and Zach's mother Mary, believe Queensland's road rules should be updated to limit the weight that drivers with medical conditions can operate. Currently, drivers are required to inform authorities if they have a medical condition, though there are no specific regulations governing what types of vehicles they are allowed to drive or tow.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe family believe that if the driver of the ute had been in a smaller vehicle, he would not have ploughed through four cars and then hit a fifth vehicle with such force. Because he allegedly had four tonnes of weight behind him, he was effectively a \"battering ram\", they said.\n\nThey have launched a petition to push for more restrictions on drivers with known medical conditions, including limiting vehicle types, restrictions on towing and a ban on bull bars.\n\n\"Immediate action is crucial to prevent further tragedies and ensure that the privilege of driving comes with the responsibility to protect others on the road,\" the petition says.\n\nZachary David Wilson, 27, was due to marry his fianc\u00e9e Lucy.

I've lost everything.\"\n\nLucy said that if the laws had been different at the time of the accident, Zach might still be alive.\n\n\"If [the ute owner] was driving a smaller car, he would have hit the first car, and that would have been the end of it,\" she said. \"It wouldn't have gone on for 200 metres and hit Zach. If he were in a smaller car, he would still be alive.\"\n\nThe tragedy of the accident weighs heavy on Mary every day.\n\n\"It's my absolute worst nightmare. I'm just trying to survive each day, I'm actually living in hell,\" she said. \"Our lives will never be the same ever again, and so much has been lost.\"\n\nZach, a council gardener, is being remembered as a beloved son and incredible human being who left a family struggling to cope with the loss.
