        "text": "Australian doctors and health fund providers are calling for the use of spinal cord stimulators to be reconsidered after research revealed one-in-four people are having revision surgery for complications.\n\nSpinal cord stimulators have been used to treat chronic pain, including back pain, neck pain, nerve pain, and complex regional pain syndrome.\n\nThe devices are made up of a small battery pack, which is implanted beneath the skin and attached to electrodes. Pulses of electricity are theoretically supposed to interfere with pain signals coming from the nerves.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Urgent childcare reforms among priorities as parliament returns\n\nAn image showing what a spinal cord stimulator would look like when inserted into a patient. (iStock)\n\nHowever, a study by leading Australian doctors, published in this week's Medical Journal of Australia , found 23 per cent of patients fitted with the device will go on to need revision surgery for complications within three years.\n\nThe median cost for the permanent device is nearly $56,000, with some patients' treatment adding up to more than $500,000.\n\n\"Given the lack of supportive data for their efficacy, and a concerning harms profile, use of spinal cord stimulators for pain control should be reconsidered,\" the researchers wrote in the journal.\n\nLead author Dr Caitlin Jones, from the University of Sydney's Institute of Musculoskeletal Health, told The Sydney Morning Herald the risk posed by the devices was much greater than the likely benefits.\n\n\"Patients should know they are taking on a substantial risk, that is exorbitantly expensive, with very little likelihood of any benefit.\"\n\nPrivate Healthcare Australia, which represents health insurance funds and their 15 million members, has backed the researchers' calls for the use of the devices to be reconsidered.\n\nPHA CEO Dr Rachel David said while the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) last year cancelled the registration of some spinal cord stimulators and imposed conditions on others, they were still available and being used on patients.\n\n\"The regulatory action taken so far has been insufficient. Put simply, if these spinal cord stimulators were new technologies trying to get listed for Medicare funding in Australia, they would be deemed too dangerous,\" she said.\n\n\"The Australian Government should ask the Medicare Services Advisory Committee to assess these devices and consider if they meet contemporary standards for listing. If not, the Medicare items and devices should be removed. This would protect patients from unnecessary harm and reduce wasteful expenditure for taxpayers and people with health insurance who are effectively being forced to fund this.\"\n\nAt least 90 per cent of spinal cord stimulators are inserted in the private health sector.\n\n\"Health funds are committed to continuing to fund evidence-based treatments which have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of chronic pain,\" David said.\n\nThe Medical Technology Association of Australia (MTAA), which represents device manufacturers has said the devices are safe and effective.\n\nStimulators were \"a demonstrably safe and effective alternative to long-term drug therapies, notably opioids\", a spokesman told The Sydney Morning Herald.",

The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe organisation left Washington for Landover, Maryland, in 1997, but DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and the team announced a deal in April to bring the Commanders back to the district at the site of the old Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.\n\nREAD MORE: Time running out for mystery lotto winner to claim jackpot\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a dinner for Republican senators in the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (AP)\n\nTrump touted the deal at the time, but the proposal is stalled before the DC Council.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week, Bowser urged the DC Council to \"make moves\" on the deal, adding that \"the Commanders are anxious\" about it.\n\nTrump expressed openness earlier this month to helping out if the DC Council does not approve the deal.\n\n\"It's a great piece of property, so we'll see. But if I can help them out, I would. \u2026 The federal government ultimately controls it,\" Trump said.\n\nIn late 2024, lawmakers in Congress passed a bill to transfer ownership of the RFK site from the federal government to the district's government.\n\n\"The owner is very, very successful and a very good man,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"It would be a great place for the NFL to be there, I can tell you that.\"\n\nEarlier Sunday, the president initially referred to the football team as the \"Washington 'Whatever's'\" and urged the owners to \"IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team.\"\n\nJayden Daniels #5 of the Washington Commanders is tackled by Jack Campbell #46 of the Detroit Lions during the third quarter in the NFC Divisional Playoff at Ford Field on January 18, 2025 in Detroit, Michigan. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) (Getty)\n\nCNN has reached out to the Commanders and the DC mayor's office for comment on Trump's posts.\n\nTrump's Sunday comments went further than ones he made earlier this month, when he told reporters the Commanders' name should be changed back to the Redskins, something he acknowledged was a \"controversial statement.\"\n\n\"It doesn't have the same ring to me,\" he said.\n\n\"But, you know, winning can make everything sound good. So, if they win, all of a sudden, the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn't have changed it.\"\n\nThe Commanders aren't the only team moniker Trump wants reverted.\n\nTrump also put the pressure on the Cleveland Guardians to change their name back to the \"Indians,\" claiming that the \"Indian people\" want the Guardians to be the \"Indians\" yet again.\n\nThe names were changed as part of a larger cultural shift as corporate brands reexamined their use of racist caricatures and stereotypical names, but Trump argued Sunday that \"times are different now.\"\n\n\"Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Times are different now than they were three or four years ago. We are a Country of passion and common sense. OWNERS, GET IT DONE!!!\"\n\nAnd in a later post Sunday, Trump claimed Matt Dolan, a former Ohio state lawmaker whose family owns the Guardians, \"has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. What he doesn't understand is that if he changed the name back to the Cleveland Indians, he might actually win an Election.\"\n\n\"Indians are being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!\" Trump added, a riff on his \"Make America Great Again,\" or MAGA, slogan.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Cleveland Guardians for comment.\n\nThe Washington football team dropped the \"Redskins\" name in 2020 after decades of criticism from Native American groups that said it was an ethnic slur and a derogatory reference to skin color.\n\nTwo years later it unveiled the \"Commanders\" name.\n\nThe Cleveland baseball team announced its name change in 2021, after similar criticism from Native Americans over the \"Indians\" moniker.",

A company spokesman later confirmed in a statement to AP that it was Byron and Astronomer chief people officer Kristin Cabot in the video.\n\nThe short video clip shows Byron and Cabot as captured on the jumbotron at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, during a Coldplay concert on Wednesday.\n\nLead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \"Jumbotron Song,\" when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.\n\nThe company posted a statement on LinkedIn.

(Supplied)\n\n\"\ufeffI thought it was a normal baby skin rash, I didn't suspect it was eczema,\" Estrada said. \ufeff\n\n\"My gut instinct was like, this is wrong, she doesn't need it... but you just think, I'm gonna listen to the doctors.\n\n\"And it worked, the little patch on her cheek, it was gone.\"\n\nBut two days after finishing the prescribed topical steroid cream treatment, she said \ufeffher daughter's symptoms worsened.\n\n\"As soon as I stopped, it just came back with a vengeance,\" Estrada said.\n\n\"It's broken, it's open, it's weeping, she doesn't sleep.\n\n\"I can't sleep because I need to hold her so she doesn't scratch.\n\n\"Her mouth cracks and bleeds from trying to eat.\"\n\nDesperate and distressed, Estrada took Xenrea to the GP and a paediatrician, who both recommended she resume the topical steroids until the symptoms cleared.\n\nBy that time, she had begun researching topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) online and had found similar cases in online support groups.\n\nXenrea's symptoms dramatically worsened after completing the prescribed 14 days of topical steroid creams. (Supplied)\n\nTSW is characterised by red, burning and itchy skin\ufeff, that sometimes presents after ceasing prolonged or high-potency steroid treatment.\n\n\"Speaking to other mothers, it sounded like she was going through a withdrawal, because, you know, I only applied (steroid cream) to her face, but it was everywhere on her body, which was identical to other parents and their kids,\" she said.\n\n\"First, it becomes really, really red and hot and burning, and then the body will ooze, the skin barrier breaks, and then it scabs, and because it's so dry it bleeds and it's prone to infection, and it's just a cycle until the new skin comes back up.\"\n\nEstrada is now seeing a naturopath and says her daughter's skin is slowly improving with the use of natural creams\ufeff, and prebiotic and probiotics for her gut health.\ufeff\n\n\"It's just been so heartbreaking seeing my daughter in so much pain and she's only six months old,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like I've still got months until her skin's gonna go back to how it was.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at The Skin Hospital in Sydney\ufeff, side effects from the use of steroid creams are rare.\n\n\"When used for skin conditions which come and go like eczema, where you are only applying them for a few days then taking a break, side effects are vanishingly rare,\" Sebaratnam said.\n\n\"When patients stop using their steroids, their underlying skin disease can flare back up, and sometimes this can be confused by people as dependency or addiction \u2013 which it isn't.\n\n\"Patients need to also consider the effects of not controlling their eczema \u2013 itch, pain, increased risk of infection, sleep disturbance, cost, the impact on the whole family et cetera.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Backpacker killer Bradley John Murdoch takes deadly secret to his grave\n\nProfessor Deshan Sebaratnam said topical steroid creams are safe when used under the direction of a doctor, and side effects are rare.

        "text": "Online shopping platforms based overseas are spending millions of extra dollars on advertising in Australia as they seek to expand their presence outside the US, following the introduction of President Donald Trump's heavy new import tariffs.\n\nThe change in marketing strategy has caused fears that a new deluge of unsafe products will flood into Australia.\n\nHannah Jacobs-Herd's nine-year-old daughter Daniella sustained severe burns in July last year, after a hoodie purchased on Temu, a Chinese e-commerce company that ships goods directly to buyers from third-party sellers, caught alight.\n\nDaniella received severe burns to 13 per cent of her body, including her face, after sparks from a fire pit hit the hoodie and it immediately went up in flames.\n\nDaniella Jacobs-Herd underwent eight weeks of skin graft operations. (Supplied: Hannah Jacobs-Herd)\n\nMs Jacobs-Herd said after the trauma suffered by her daughter, it was distressing to see a deluge of Temu advertising pop up when she played free games on her tablet computer.\n\n\"She [Daniella] cannot escape Temu. We cannot escape Temu. It is just everywhere,\" she said.\n\nMs Jacobs-Herd said she braced for more advertising from the platform when she heard about Mr Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs targeting China.\n\n\"I lost it because I knew that we were going to get bombarded,\" she said.\n\nTrump call drives Temu to Australia\n\nIn April this year, Mr Trump signed an executive order restoring an import charge for Chinese goods valued at or under $US800 ($1,224).\n\nThe move doubled the cost of goods bought through Temu by American consumers, driving the company away from the US to more favourable markets, including Europe and Australia.\n\nDonald Trump removed an import fee exemption for low-cost China goods in April. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque)\n\nGoods worth less than $1,000 can generally be imported into Australia free of duties, taxes or charges, meaning retailers do not need to absorb import fees or pass them on to Australian consumers.\n\nSharing data exclusively with the ABC, US market intelligence firm Sensor Tower said Temu had more than doubled its monthly Australian advertising spend from April to June 2025, compared with March.\n\nSince Temu's 110 per cent increase in advertising spend, the platform's monthly users have increased by 50 per cent for the June quarter.\n\nShein, another Chinese marketplace app, increased its monthly Australian advertising spend by 160 per cent, for a 15 per cent increase in monthly users.\n\nMarket analysts say Temu has more than doubled its monthly Australian advertising spend. (Reuters: Florence Lo)\n\nSensor Tower estimated Temu spent more than $4 million on Australian advertising in January alone, primarily through Facebook and Instagram.\n\nTaylor Brydges, a research principal at the University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures, said the Sensor Tower data was representative of Temu's shift away from the US.\n\n\"Temu is looking to \u2026 the kind of places where shipping is still low cost and \u2026 crucially, where consumers are still quite price sensitive due to cost-of-living pressures,\" Dr Brydges said.\n\nTemu did not directly respond to questions from the ABC about its increased advertising spend in Australia.\n\nA spokesperson said the company opened the platform to Australian suppliers in March this year to better support them to cater for the local market.\n\nHannah Jacobs-Herd wants stronger consumer protection laws in place. (ABC Wide Bay: James C Taylor)\n\nDaniella's mother said she was worried more Temu customers would be harmed because of Australia's weak consumer protection laws.\n\n\"There should be more enforcement around it,\" Ms Jacobs-Herd said.\n\nIt is a sentiment echoed by consumer protection advocates.\n\nGeneral safety provision\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) recently released a report on its five-year inquiry into digital platforms.\n\nThe report found Temu had rapidly become Australia's most-used retail marketplace app since launching in the country in March 2023.\n\nTemu has become Australia's most-used retail marketplace app. (Supplied: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission)\n\nIt noted that, unlike Australia, regions including the European Union, Canada and the US had responded to the growing popularity of online retail platforms like Temu by prohibiting the sale of unsafe goods.\n\nConsumer advocacy group Choice has been calling for a similar general safety provision since 2020.\n\nChoice deputy director of campaigns Andy Kelly said recent research by the group showed 74 per cent of consumers mistakenly believed businesses were legally required to ensure products were safe before selling them in Australia.\n\n\"A general safety provision is long overdue. We know consumers have a false sense of security when it comes to product safety in Australia,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury Andrew Leigh said the government was considering the findings of the ACCC's report, including the recommendation for a proactive general safety provision.\n\n\"No business should gain a competitive advantage by compromising on safety. Australian consumers deserve to know that online marketplaces value their safety and have taken steps to ensure their products are safe to use,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Leigh says the government is considering the findings of the ACCC report. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nIn the meantime, Ms Jacobs-Herd said she worried other families would suffer harm after seeking a bargain.\n\n\"We're just pretty much like any person who want to buy their child an Oodie but they can't afford it, so they find a knock-off \u2014 lots of people do that,\" she said.\n\n\" If I go online and buy the same thing for a cheaper price, I've got to question if my kid's going to die from this product. \"\n\nWill Temu and Shein change the way we shop online forever? Photo shows Clothing website Shein is shown on a computer screen, and online retailer Temu is shown on mobile phone screen. The cost-of-living crisis has seen Shein and Temu become major players in online retail, but their meteoric rise comes at the expense of local businesses.\n\nFour months after Daniella was burned, Temu issued a voluntary recall notice for the hoodie in consultation with the ACCC.\n\nMs Jacobs-Herd, who lives three hours north of Brisbane in Hervey Bay, is currently engaged in a lawsuit with Temu over the incident.\n\nA Temu spokesperson told the ABC the company had banned the merchant involved from selling \"children-related products\" on its platform globally.\n\nThe spokesperson said as a third-party marketplace, Temu required all merchants to fully comply with local laws and standards.\n\n\"We have in place a quality assurance system that includes vetting sellers and product listings, physical spot checks \u2026 monitoring using technology and human reviewers, and swift enforcement action,\" they said.\n\n\"We are also in discussions with the ACCC about becoming a signatory to the Online Product Safety Pledge.\"",

        "text": "Spare a thought for the rest of them \u2014 the literally thousands of professional golfers whose lifelong dedication to the most torturous of sports has cost them unquantifiable time, money and extracts of their souls.\n\nThese men and women who would give it all up again three times over for that one perfect day, when the wind blows just right, all the putts catch lips and fall in, and their name is the one adorning the top of the leaderboard at sunset.\n\nWhat were they to think when they saw Scottie Scheffler, the best player on the planet, tell the world that the view from the top wasn't all that?\n\n\"It feels like you work your whole life to celebrate winning a tournament for like a few minutes,\" Scheffler said a few days out from the first round of the Open Championship at Royal Portrush.\n\n\"It only lasts a few minutes, that kind of euphoric feeling.\n\n\"You win it, you celebrate, hug my family, my sister's there, it's an amazing moment. Then it's like, OK, what we eating for dinner? Life goes on.\"\n\nScottie Scheffler opened up in a pre-Open press conference. ( AP: Francisco Seco)\n\nScheffler's five-minute stream-of-consciousness monologue in that press conference was remarkable. Even more so now that he has gone and wiped the floor with the field to win his first Open Championship title by four shots.\n\nThis victory was so total, and the gap between Scheffler and the rest of the world is now so great, that he can be held up alongside the great Tiger Woods without hyperbole.\n\nBy just about any measure or metric, Scheffler is the best since Tiger.\n\nIt's there in the numbers, and in the numbers behind the numbers. It's there in the relentless, suffocating winning, and in the ability to make a 54-hole lead feel like a foregone conclusion before Sunday even arrives.\n\nIt's there in the testimony of those who would know, including Jim \"Bones\" Mackay \u2014 Phil Mickelson's long-time caddy whose view of Tiger's mastery was better than most \u2014 who said of Scheffler on Saturday: \"I never thought in my lifetime I'd see a player as close to Tiger as this man currently is.\"\n\nScheffler plays and wins like Tiger did. Tiger reached global mega-stardom thanks to his charisma and ability to produce the spectacular when required, but for the most part, his major victories were built on a tasteful monotony.\n\nHit the fairway, hit the middle of the green, one-putt for birdie or two-putt for par. Nothing flashy, nothing silly. Let the others make their mistakes as they get lost and dizzy in the churn of your orbit.\n\nWithout the \"Tiger-mania\" factor, Scheffler has often come across as a dry and unengaging champion, unique only for the excessive footwork in his apparently foolproof swing.\n\nScottie Scheffler was unflappable and frequently brilliant at Royal Portrush. (Getty Images: David Cannon)\n\nBut in one press conference, Scheffler has changed perceptions. Here is a man who almost feels guilty for how much he likes golf, terrified it might one day interfere with the things that provide fulfilment in the \"deepest places of your heart\".\n\nHe is addicted to winning, but he's not sure why, and he kind of wishes he wasn't. By his own admission, he will give this career away should it ever begin to adversely impact his relationship with his wife, Meredith, or his 14-month-old son, Bennett.\n\nIn this sense, without putting too fine a point on it, Scheffler is the anti-Tiger.\n\nNothing in the universe has ever mattered as much to Tiger as winning golf tournaments. It consumed him, created him, propelled him and then eventually destroyed him.\n\nThese are likely not obstacles Scheffler will ever have to clear. His level head means that more than any other post-2010 challenger to Tiger's throne, he has the best chance to emulate his deeds.\n\nRory McIlroy was the first to be ordained, and in completing the career grand slam at the Masters this year, proved those comparisons were not entirely misplaced.\n\nRory McIlroy is a captivating and brilliant golfer, but is more emotionally volatile than Scottie Scheffler. (Getty Images: Michael Reaves)\n\nBut McIlroy is emotional and streaky, stuck between caring so incredibly much that he becomes an all-conquering cyborg like Tiger, and caring just enough to maintain calm and perspective like Scheffler.\n\nJordan Spieth had a run at it in his early 20s and was endlessly entertaining in doing so, but burned out when the exhilarating shots stopped coming off and self-doubt crept in. Spieth never knew how to play boring, let alone master it like Scheffler.\n\nBrooks Koepka is a more interesting comparison, as his is the strongest post-Tiger major resume. His schtick was nonchalance, but while replacing Scheffler's existentialism with frat house egotism \u2014 \"why would I even care about this, bro? This is just so easy for me\".\n\nBut golf never stays easy for long, and Koepka was rarely able to inspire himself outside of the brightest lights.\n\nFor now and for the foreseeable future, there is just Scottie Scheffler.\n\nGoing from the depths of his press conference rabbit hole on Tuesday to the runaway Champion Golfer of the Year on Sunday, again proved his mental fortitude is just as elite as his ball striking.\n\nOf course, what Scheffler said in that press conference was painfully true. Once he has set the Claret Jug down somewhere safe, he and his family will begin to plan for dinner, try like hell to get Bennett to sleep in a reasonable time frame, and then begin thinking about the next tournament.\n\nOn and on it goes. He still may not be any closer to discovering what the point of it all really is.\n\nBut one would hope that the glow from this victory lasts a little longer. It's not every day that you touch the clouds upon which greatness rests, let alone pull yourself up and take a seat.",

(ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nAuthorities took them and their siblings from their family's farm near Tambellup, 320 kilometres south of Perth, to Roelands Native Mission in 1973, after the scheme's cut-off date of July 1, 1972, meaning they are not eligible for the reparation payments the scheme provides for.\n\n\"There was physical, emotional and sexual abuse that occurred during my time at the missions and also during my time in other state facilities,\" Ms Ryder said.\n\n\" I know you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere but to hear that date \u2026 how does that address our trauma? \"\n\nCourt records show Angela Ryder n\u00e9e Edmonds was declared a neglected child.

(Supplied: Yokai)\n\nMs Edmonds was just six and was removed four times in total, spending time in Roelands, Wandering and Marribank.\n\nCourt records show the sisters were declared neglected and committed to state custody, though neither could recall ever attending court and both reported living a happy, stable life with their parents before they were taken.\n\nA government report from that year shows children in WA could be committed to state care if their parents were found to be neglectful or if they themselves were deemed \"neglected by virtue of his own behaviour\".\n\nCut-off date reflects policy change\n\nThe siblings will miss out on the $85,000 individual payments to be offered to individual survivors.\n\nBut Ms Edmonds said what was more upsetting was the disregard for her lived experience.\n\n\"We were still getting assimilated and put into missions after that date,\" she said.\n\n\" I don't understand how they can say it ceased. \"\n\nAngela Ryder says she and her sister were no less hurt by WA's forced removal policies. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nThe state government told the ABC the cut-off date aligned with when the Native Welfare Act 1963 was repealed, replaced with the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act 1972.\n\nThe new act abolished the Department of Native Welfare and created the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority, which was no longer directly involved in out-of-home care for Aboriginal children in WA, though records show it continued to fund missions into the 1980s.\n\nA national inquiry into the Stolen Generations found about one in 10 Aboriginal people in WA were in institutions in 1972, the majority children.\n\nThe report showed the number of children committed to state care started to decline around this time but removals did continue.\n\nThe Healing Foundation, an organisation supporting Stolen Generations survivors and their families, said it could take some time for shifts in practice to follow legislative change.\n\n\"Other [states' redress] schemes have been flexible in their time frames to acknowledge sentiment doesn't change the day a policy is abolished,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nAngela Ryder campaigning for redress with Yokai in 2023.

What was I doing, doing this presentation?'\n\n\" It was a win for us. Not a big win, but it's something. But it wasn't a big win for me. \"\n\nMs Kearing said she immediately thought of her brothers, who had spent much of their time at Roelands trying to protect her, and would also miss out.\n\n\"What happened to them was pretty severe.

        "text": "A gas development backed by media mogul Kerry Stokes has been tapping into Western Australia's domestic gas market to supply overseas customers amid long delays in the delivery of the plant.\n\nThe Waitsia gas project, 350km north of Perth, was billed as a \"shovel-ready\" lifeline for construction workers in 2020 when former premier Mark McGowan announced it would be exempted from the state's onshore gas export ban.\n\nAt the time, the project was supposed to cost $700 million and be operational by late 2023.\n\nMark McGowan granted the project an exemption from WA's onshore gas export ban until 2028. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nMr McGowan said unless Waitsia was exempted from the ban, \"the project might not happen\" and the gas may have stayed in the ground.\n\nBut almost two years after that deadline and with a construction bill running at almost double the original estimate, the project is still not ready.\n\nIn the meantime, the ABC can reveal the project's owners have been taking gas from the domestic market to supply their customers overseas.\n\nKerry Stokes's Seven Group is behind Beach Energy, one of Waitsia's two owners. (AAP Image: Richard Wainwright)\n\nWaitsia's owners are Beach Energy \u2014 the ASX-listed gas producer backed by Seven Group, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Stokes \u2014 and Mitsui, a Japanese trading firm.\n\nGas diverted for export\n\nFilings by Beach and public reporting of supplies to and from the Dampier to Bunbury gas pipeline \u2014 WA's main energy artery \u2014 suggest the partners have sent more than a dozen liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes since late 2023.\n\nAs much as 180 terajoules a day \u2014 or roughly 15 per cent of the gas used in the local WA market \u2014 has been diverted for export at times during that period, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator's gas bulletin board.\n\nIn its filings, Beach said the gas has been sourced via so-called swap arrangements, in which the company takes existing supplies from the domestic market on the promise it will return an equivalent amount later when Waitsia is up and running.\n\nThe gas is processed into LNG at the North West Shelf, a giant plant in the Pilbara where supplies have been dwindling for years.\n\nWoodside's Karratha Gas Plant forms part of the North West Shelf gas development. (Supplied: Woodside)\n\nWhile neither company would comment, Waitsia's backers have pointed out that prices for gas in WA's domestic market have been falling in recent times.\n\nFrom as much as $11.60 a gigajoule in late 2023, according to Perth-based firm Gas Trading Australia, prices on the spot market had fallen to just $6 a gigajoule.\n\nOn the east coast, by contrast, prices were trading between $10 and $15 a gigajoule.\n\n'Serendipity'\n\nPeter Strachan, a veteran resources analyst, said the fact prices had been falling while Waitsia's partners were exporting domestic gas was nothing more than luck.\n\nMr Strachan said while there was nothing unlawful about what the partners were doing, it raised questions about the integrity of WA's domestic gas market.\n\n\"It's serendipity,\" Mr Strachan said.\n\nPeter Strachan says the revelations raise questions about the integrity of WA's domestic gas market. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)\n\n\"It might be good business operations, but I think it goes against the whole idea that the gas in Western Australia is for West Australians to consume.\n\n\"And that's whether it's today or tomorrow or in 10 or 20 years' time.\"\n\nUnder WA's laws, the market is supplied courtesy of a 15 per cent reservation policy on offshore fields.\n\nIt is also supplied by onshore fields.\n\nUp until the exemption awarded to Waitsia, onshore projects had exclusively supplied the local market.\n\nAfter years of chopping and changing policy, the WA government last year said it would allow onshore developers to export up to 20 per cent of their reserves but only until 2030.\n\nDespite being slated to begin operations in 2023, the Waitsia project is still not operational. (Supplied: Clough Group)\n\nBy that time, the Australian Energy Market Operator has forecast that WA will enter a structural deficit of gas, sparking warnings that some users could be pushed to the wall.\n\nClough collapse blighted Waitsia\n\nMr Strachan said some of the problems that had bedevilled Waitsia were beyond the control of its owners.\n\nChief among them was the collapse of construction company Clough in late 2022.\n\n'Disaster' fears for WA's gas supply as billionaires seek to cash in Photo shows A large gas plant with lots of metal infrastructure. WA's policy of preventing gas produced onshore from being exported was hailed as a masterstroke during the east coast's energy crisis. But with pressure to ease those restrictions coming from billionaires, some say that could lead to disaster.\n\nBut he queried why Beach and Mitsui were being allowed to take relatively cheap gas from the domestic market to cover their position with buyers overseas.\n\n\"They had to find some gas from somewhere to meet those obligations they couldn't meet because their project was basically two years delayed,\" he said.\n\n\"You would have thought if they were stuck and had to find gas, they could have \u2026 bought that gas on the open market from the North West Shelf or from Gorgon or from somewhere in Kuwait.\n\n\"But they might have made a loss doing that.\n\nAn aerial photo of the Waitsia Gas Project under construction in WA's Mid West.

(ABC News: Daniel Mercer)\n\nMr Harris said it was true domestic users were currently enjoying a period of relatively subdued pricing.\n\nBut he said that reprieve was likely to be temporary.\n\nWhat's more, he said it had been largely caused by the loss of some major gas customers, such as mining giant BHP's Nickel West division and an alumina refinery owned by Alcoa.\n\nIn the world's largest isolated grid, a big bet is being placed on giant batteries Photo shows Aerial shot of rows of white battery containers in the foreground and coal plant/cooling tower in background In Western Australia, the world's largest island grid is taking a huge bet, and carrying out a major experiment, on the role of batteries in the energy transition.\n\nThere had also been, he noted, a short-term bump in extra supplies from Woodside's Pluto project following scrutiny from a state parliamentary inquiry.\n\n\"All forecasts say that is just a short-term phenomenon,\" he said.\n\n\"Within a couple of years, we're going to be heading for a shortfall, and that's certainly what all the forecasts say by 2028, we're in for a significant shortfall of gas.\"\n\nOpposition critical\n\nThe WA government declined a request to be interviewed about the exports.\n\nInstead, it issued a statement in which a spokesperson said Waitsia's export approval also came with a commitment to supply domestic gas.\n\nA closer look at the Waitsia Gas Plant, inland of Dongara.

(ABC News: Daniel Mercer)\n\nShadow Energy Minister Steve Thomas was not as charitable.\n\nDr Thomas said the export of domestic supplies was clearly never intended by those who designed the state's domestic gas policy.\n\n\"I don't think the architects of the domestic gas policy ever expected that onshore domestic gas would have to be substituted into the offshore market to meet existing contracts,\" Dr Thomas said.\n\n\" I don't think that was in the design. \"\n\nHe argued the government had been so inconsistent in its management of domestic gas policies that they had been turned into a mess.\n\n\"So the domestic gas policy either stands up or it doesn't,\" he said.\n\nHow much gas is actually there?\n\nUnder the terms of the deal in 2020, the Waitsia partners were allowed until the end of 2028 to export 7.5 million tonnes of LNG.\n\nMr Harris from the DomGas Alliance noted that the project partners were fast running out of time in which to meet their export quotas.\n\nGiven the lucrative nature of the overseas LNG market, where gas can fetch far higher prices than from domestic buyers, he anticipated a push to extend the export approvals.\n\nFears WA's main grid 'slowly collapsing' as gas-fired power plant plant teeters on edge Photo shows Drone shot of the gas plant at sunset In the latest sign of stress for WA's biggest grid, its most important gas plant sought a bailout amid fears of insolvency.\n\nBut he stressed it was something the alliance would oppose.\n\nAnd he warned a failure to do so would risk higher gas prices and \"mean the projects that we want to happen like critical minerals won't be able to find gas\".\n\n\"They [Waitsia] were always given a timeline when they had to deliver their bargain to the state, which was to deliver gas into the domestic market in 2029,\" Mr Harris said.\n\n\"And that timeline should stick.\"\n\nPeter Strachan agreed but wondered whether Waitsia would still have the reserves to supply the WA market after 2028, noting the project's partners had been progressively writing down their estimates of the gas contained in the field.\n\n\"Where they thought there would be gas they've drilled and 'oh, there's no gas',\" Mr Strachan said.\n\n\"They're lucky now that they've actually got enough gas to meet their commitments.

(ABC News: James Elton)\n\nOver the past year, interstate investors have increasingly turned their focus to the NT, where houses and units remain among the most affordable to buy in the country and rental yields are among the highest.\n\nReal estate agents have told the ABC they can sell homes to interstate investors \"within hours\", often before they are publicly advertised, with some saying the fierce competition to sell properties fast has left them no choice but to play along.\n\nNick Mousellis, an independent real estate agent in Darwin, first started getting calls from interstate investors about a year ago and now fields numerous requests a week.\n\nNick Mousellis has been a real estate agent in Darwin for more than three decades. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\n\"Almost every two to three days, we have an inquiry or an e-mail from a buyer agent,\" he said.\n\nOver the past year he's seen an increase between 3 and 10 per cent in Darwin property prices, and soaring competition for local homes.\n\n\"People are missing out \u2026 I haven't seen this sort of activity for quite a while,\" he said.\n\nMr Mousellis said interstate investors were targeting homes priced between $500,000 and $650,000, spending a small amount on renovations, and then leasing them at a higher price.\n\nA landlord's market\n\nNicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, said the sudden flood of interstate buyers had positioned the NT as an investment hotspot \u2014 second only to New South Wales.\n\nInterstate investors are increasingly looking to Darwin properties, which is driving up the cost of renting in the NT. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"[Rental] house yields are sitting at around 6 per cent, and [rental] unit yields are anywhere between 7 and 8 per cent,\" she said.\n\n\"Compare that to a market like Sydney \u2014 where rental yields are sitting at 3 per cent \u2014 you can understand why investors are looking towards those cash positive locations like Darwin.\"\n\nDarwin's 0.3 per cent vacancy rate compares with a national rate of between 2 and 3 per cent, according to Domain's June Quarter Rent Report.\n\nUnit rents are at record highs across all capital cities including Darwin and, while house rents remain at record highs in all capitals, prices in Darwin dropped $20 in June.\n\nDr Powell said interstate investors had the ability to revitalise stagnant markets but, in this case, they were likely \"nudging first home buyers\" out of the market and making it harder for people to secure an affordable rental.\n\nDr Nicola Powell says Darwin is experiencing a rental crisis. (Supplied)\n\n\"We do have a rental crisis,\" she said.\n\n\"When you've got a vacancy rate that is very tight at 0.3 per cent \u2026 it means it is very competitive for tenants \u2014 to have a balanced rental market, you need that vacancy rate to be between 2 and 3 per cent.\n\n\"You tend to find that investors and first-time buyers go for similar priced properties.\n\n\" That makes it more challenging for a first-time buyer to break into the market, because ultimately a first-time buyer doesn't have as deep pockets as an investor does. \"\n\nUnaffordability linked to supply\n\nRuth Palmer has been the executive director of the Property Council of Australia's NT division for over a decade and said she hadn't seen a \"shift\" quite like this before.\n\nShe said Alice Springs had seen a \"significant jump\" in median house prices and improvement in the volume of sales.\n\nMs Palmer said, with both sales and building approvals up, many NT real estate agents now had \"a bunch of investors on their books who are chasing properties\".\n\nProperty Council of Australia's Ruth Palmer says the NT needs to increase housing supply. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\n\"Sometimes the properties don't even get to market before they're snapped up by an investor, and this can occur within about 24 to 48 hours,\" she said.\n\n\"What this can do is put a bit of an imbalance into the market, so while our volume sales are up and while we're seeing a lot of transaction, it doesn't exactly mean that it's growing the population.\n\n\" It obviously brings in that squeeze on the rental market, and drives up prices in that space as well. \"\n\nMs Palmer said, as the NT continued to face high construction costs and a shortage of tradies, more needed to be done to \"stimulate new builds\".\n\n\"Without more supply, affordability will remain a challenge,\" she said.\n\nIn the March 2025 quarter, building approvals rose over 50 per cent compared with the previous quarter, according to the Property Council's latest report.",

(Supplied)\n\nWhile overt discrimination is rare, Ms Lambart has tips for those over 50, including modernising resumes, having a professional online presence and upskilling in technology.\n\n\"Sometimes candidates will say to me, 'I'm being discriminated against my age,' but when I look at their resume, it looks like something out of the '70s and is 10-pages long,\" she said.\n\n\" They don't need to include every job they've held since they were 20. \"\n\nUnemployment rate rises to 4.3pc in June Photo shows Queen Street Mall, Brisbane 2025-01-09 10:01:00 The national unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in June, up from 4.1 per cent in May.\n\nNicole Gorton, director at recruitment agency Robert Half, believes the perception of \"older workers\" by those hiring is largely driven by assumptions about technology adoption.\n\n\"When I am speaking to organisations and hiring managers, they have a strong appetite for digital fluency,\" she said.\n\n\"The adoption of technology, the adoption of AI, and when you haven't grown up with it and you have to learn it\u2026 there is a perception that the older, more experienced worker has not got some of those skill sets.\"\n\nWomen experience unique biases\n\nLisa Annese, CEO of Chief Executive Women, said she was genuinely surprised by the shifting perception of hirers.\n\nMs Annese said it would have been helpful if the report included gender-specific data, noting women's experiences and unique biases relating to perimenopause, menopause and caring responsibilities.\n\nLisa Annese finds it unfortunate that age-based biases impact women during what should be their career \"sweet spot\". (Supplied)\n\nShe said women aged in their 50s, were often in a \"sweet spot\" for progression.\n\n\"It can be a liberating time in women's lives to really pursue their career,\" she said.\n\n\"You often talk about women saying this is 'my time' now and that could still be [aged in their 50s] what I would consider quite a young age.\"\n\nFor Bob Epps he has now settled into a chief executive role leading a taxi service in Cairns, proving he's still got some mileage left.",

        "text": "The problem in EVs, solar panels, batteries and other industries that supply them \u2013 and it\u2019s not a problem confined to those sectors \u2013 is that China\u2019s economic model has prioritised investment, production and jobs. Beijing has identified strategic areas of growth in its rolling five-year national economic plans and handed out massive financial subsidies to those sectors to stimulate investment. BYD, the world\u2019s biggest EV maker, slashed domestic prices by up to 34 per cent earlier this year, triggering a price war. Credit: Bloomberg Local governments, anxious to get their share of investment and jobs, then offer their own incentives and help fuel a rush by companies to do what Beijing has encouraged them to do, leading to overinvestment and overcapacity. Exports are the safety valve for the excess capacity, particularly in the post-property crisis, post-pandemic environment, where domestic demand has been weak.\n\nFaced with pushback (even before Donald Trump started slapping tariffs on everyone) from export markets concerned that China was undermining their industries and persistent deflation within its own economy \u2013 from the US to countries in Europe and Latin America \u2013 it would appear that China has finally recognised the need to act. Loading A decade ago, China had similar overcapacity issues in its steel and coal sectors. Beijing responded by forcing plant closures and corporate consolidations, while avoiding economic shock by pumping fiscal stimulus into the economy. Unlike the current overinvestment, however, those sectors were largely state-owned. It will be trickier trying to corral the multitude of private companies engaged in the crowded advanced manufacturing sectors that Beijing has identified for China\u2019s latest phase of growth. It will be even trickier in the face of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nWhile the US and China agreed to an uneasy truce after a tit-for-tat exchange of absurdly high tariffs \u2013 Trump announced a 145 per cent rate on imports from China and Beijing responded with a 125 per cent rate on imports from the US \u2013 the continuing 30 per cent US tariff on goods, once pre-existing tariffs (leftovers from the 2018-19 trade war) are taken into account, means China\u2019s exports to the US still face a 55 per cent duty. China\u2019s most recent trade numbers, for June, showed a record $US586 billion ($900 billion) surplus when they were published last week, or 5.8 per cent above the same month last year. Exports to the US, however, were 16.1 per cent lower than in June last year. It was exports to South-East Asia, Europe and Japan that accounted for the growth. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has complicated matters for Beijing. Credit: Bloomberg With Trump\u2019s deal with Vietnam, including punitive tariffs on trans-shipped exports to the US \u2013 targeting Chinese goods re-routed through third countries to exploit lower duty rates \u2013 America\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff regime poses a major threat to China\u2019s ability to continue to rely on trade for growth. Last year, Beijing tried to stimulate domestic consumption with incentives for trade-ins of autos and household appliances and other goods.\n\nThat seems to have had some effects \u2013 China\u2019s GDP grew 5.3 per cent in the June quarter, compared with the same period last year \u2013 but it\u2019s a policy whose impact will inevitably wane, as the number of remaining households with the capacity to take advantage of it dwindles. In Trump\u2019s new world trade order, there will be less global trade and less trade with China, which implies radical changes to China\u2019s economic model. There are other, more sustainable, measures that Beijing could take to boost domestic consumption, particularly increased spending on China\u2019s social welfare safety nets, but Xi has been reluctant to embark on large-scale stimulus spending or to re-balance the economy away from its over-reliance on exports. Having experiencing the implosion of China\u2019s property sector, a sector that had been used and incentivised to stimulate the wider economy during periods of economic stress, the authorities would understand that the extent of overinvestment and overcapacity in other sectors today is a threat to China\u2019s economic and social stability that could be exacerbated by a downturn in trade. The threat doesn\u2019t come from Donald Trump alone. On Friday, the G7 economies agreed to increase their collective efforts to respond to the impact of China\u2019s over-capacities and the flood of exports it is producing, along with its dominance of strategic sectors, including rare earths.",

        "text": "Pressed on specifics, Driussi was diplomatically vague: \u201cWe\u2019re exploring multiple AI applications, but competitive advantage comes from execution, not just ideas. The technology helps us analyse information and identify patterns that might otherwise be missed.\u201d What makes the Bulldogs\u2019 AI adoption particularly intriguing is Driussi\u2019s other role as CEO of Quantium, an Australian artificial intelligence and advanced analytics company. The firm works with major Australian companies, such as Woolworths, Commonwealth Bank, Telstra and Qantas. Bulldogs players are already benefiting from AI. Credit: Getty Images The connection provides the Bulldogs access to world-class AI expertise that would typically cost NRL clubs millions of dollars to develop themselves. While Driussi is careful not to discuss any formal arrangements, the potential for knowledge transfer is obvious. The \u201cFamily Club\u201d previously revealed it used AI to identify Jacob Preston during his recruitment from the Roosters\u2019 pathways system, suggesting the technology has been instrumental in some of their personnel decisions.\n\nAI\u2019s influence on sport was one of the topics discussed at the NRL\u2019s Business of Sport Conference in Las Vegas at the University of Nevada, just before this year\u2019s season-opening matches at Allegiant Stadium. The headline speakers were Driussi and Paul Devlin, the latter the global strategy leader for betting, gaming and sports technology at Amazon Web Services. Devlin, who has held high-performance roles at the Brisbane Broncos, South Sydney, Parramatta and Melbourne Storm, said AI would transform the sporting landscape. AI is being used extensively in the NFL. Credit: AP \u201cWe see AI as absolutely revolutionary, and we think it will impact every area of business in the future,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cSo everybody should be experimenting with it right now, so that was kind of the key message that came out of that NRL event ... AI is going to improve every area of business, but it is really clear on the insight generation from the data side of it in a sport like rugby league on talent identification, load monitoring, safety of the games through simulations, as well as the fan side of sport as well.\u201d\n\nSeveral NRL clubs are already dabbling with AI. One leading head coach, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the club\u2019s intellectual property, said that AI had the potential to help analysts wade through reams of data to come up with a couple of key takeaways when preparing for an opponent. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see the next step in world sport, how AI can save you time in identifying those trends so you\u2019re not wasting time doing it yourself,\u201d the coach says. \u201cThe advantage you get is saving man-hours, so you actually spend less time on computers and more with the players. \u201cYou can see the information that\u2019s relevant; missed tackles is the most outdated stat because there\u2019s no context to it. And completion rates; seven of the top-10 completing teams didn\u2019t make the finals last year.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a practical example of how AI is being used. One club found the best way to beat the Storm is to limit their time in possession. If you can restrict them to less than 23 minutes and 25 seconds with the football \u2013 they average 26 minutes and 36 seconds \u2013 you have an almost 100 per cent chance of winning. Not easy to do in reality, but it\u2019s useful information. While most NRL teams focus heavily on pre-contact metres \u2013 the distance gained before first defensive contact \u2013 to build momentum, a different focus is required to beat Canberra. AI found the Raiders were uniquely driven by post-contact metres, those tough yards gained after contact. Limit those metres, and you can stop the Green Machine. AI has already identified at least one way to try to stop the Melbourne Storm. Credit: Getty Images Canterbury\u2019s embracing of AI reflects a broader transformation sweeping through professional sport worldwide. American sports leagues are leading the charge, with the NFL processing more than 500 million data points per season through its Digital Athlete system, reducing player injuries by 700 missed games since 2023. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis and injury prevention, while the NBA uses machine learning for player load management and game strategy optimisation. English Premier League clubs are using AI for recruitment: Brighton\u2019s system identified Moises Caicedo before his eventual \u00a3115 million ($240 million) transfer from them to Chelsea, while Liverpool\u2019s partnership with Google DeepMind has produced tactical analysis tools that club experts prefer over traditional methods 90 per cent of the time.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Canterbury\u2019s AI implementation is understandable given the competitive implications; NRL clubs are notoriously protective of innovations that might provide advantages. The technological investment aligns with the Bulldogs\u2019 recent restructure. The blue and whites are constructing a $50 million centre of excellence at Belmore and have significantly expanded their pathways programs, including taking over the Fiji Silktails program. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe\u2019re building for long-term success,\u201d Driussi says. \u201cThat means investing in the best people, the best facilities and the best technology available to us.\u201d Bulldogs chief executive Aaron Warburton confirmed the club\u2019s commitment to innovation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to improve our operations and give our players and staff the best possible tools to succeed,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cTechnology is certainly part of that equation.\u201d Loading The club\u2019s return to finals football last year, after missing the post-season for eight seasons, has been attributed to improved recruitment, player development and coaching. However, the role of AI in this transformation remains largely hidden. Given the global AI sports market is tipped to grow from $1.2 billion to nearly $30 billion by 2032, getting in early could be the key to success. Already, rivals are playing catch-up to Canterbury. For a club that has endured wooden spoons and years of mediocrity, the Bulldogs are marrying old-school values with cutting-edge technology. Whether that translates to premiership glory remains to be seen, but the Bulldogs are betting heavily that the future of rugby league will be shaped by artificial intelligence.",

During the 1900s, they spread into other trades and services, finding prosperity in fruit and vegetable trading, shopkeeping, tobacco farming and clothes laundering. The end of the White Australia policy in 1973 brought another wave of migrants.\n\nBut unlike Melbourne and regional cities such as Bendigo (which established its Golden Dragon Museum in 1991) and Ararat (which opened its Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre in 2001), Sydney has fallen behind in establishing its own museum to showcase the contributions of Chinese Australians. That looked to finally change in mid-2020. As the pandemic set in, Lord Mayor Clover Moore announced the council would lease the property to the Museum of Chinese in Australia. It would feature a gallery and exhibition space, programming activities, community spaces for events, an artist-in-residence program, and a cafe and shop. It is chaired by 82-year-old Daphne Lowe Kelly, who has spent most of her career serving Chinese-Australian organisations, and was presided over by Dr John Yu, a Chinese-born Australian paediatrician and 1996 Australian of the Year. But neither the council nor the museum\u2019s leadership anticipated the challenges of establishing a new gallery in a heritage-listed 19th-century building. While the site has given the museum a spiritual and physical home, with rent subsidised by the council, the lease agreement contains pages of added requirements, heritage restrictions and red tape. \u201cThis is an amazing gift,\u201d new MOCA chief executive Peter Cai said of the building. \u201cAnd it came with a lot of conditions, and some conditions are not easy to address. There are a lot of costs to remedy.\u201d\n\nThe initial renovation proposal, overseen by Tony Stephens, the previous chief executive who departed the organisation in January, came to roughly $4.7 million, said Kelly, who estimates the true cost would have been closer to $6 million or $7 million after factoring in contingencies and other unanticipated expenses. Figures from the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) show revenue from donations and bequests came to $1,766,821 in the four years between fiscal 2021 and 2024. This figure doesn\u2019t include rent subsidies from the City of Sydney\u2019s accommodation grant program, $2.28 million from Create NSW given in 2022, or two grants from the National Foundation for Australia-China Relations that exceeded $400,000. In the absence of local donations, lobbying government has been crucial. \u201cIt was almost impossible trying to raise any funds during COVID,\u201d Kelly said. \u2018People are now questioning many things\u2019\n\nA number of departures on the museum\u2019s board has added to perceptions of volatility. Only three inaugural board members remain: Kelly, Joanna Capon and Yin Cao. Dr John Yu, Stephen FitzGerald and Su-Ming Wong have departed the board. Since then, a number of others have come and gone. Loading One former director, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential matters freely, said board members had at times disagreed on the best approach to raising money. \u201cIt\u2019s become a fundraising issue. They need a certain amount of money to open. They haven\u2019t been able to achieve that yet,\u201d they said. Despite being volunteers for the charity, the former board member described the work as a \u201cfull-time job\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was very intense,\u201d they said. \u201cI found myself spending a lot of time on the wrong things. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve stepped off the board, I\u2019m still a big supporter and would love to see it open.\u201d An active representative of the Chinatown community, who declined to be named, said the museum had lost a lot of the goodwill it initially had. \u201cBecause it\u2019s been years, people are losing interest or faith,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople are now questioning many things; where has [the money] gone, how has it been spent?\u201d The same Chinatown community representative feels the museum has had little to show. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fix the building with the money you have, what are you delivering in the meantime?\u201d they asked. \u201cThey\u2019re not engaging in the community at all.\u201d Kelly is aware of the critiques. \u201cThey don\u2019t really know what goes behind the scenes, what has to be actually done, and how difficult it is to achieve a lot of what it takes to actually get it open,\u201d she said.\n\nPutting on a show Plans are now being redrawn for a \u201creduced scope\u201d refurbishment. Even then, Kelly estimates opening will cost $3 million to $4 million. \u201cThat\u2019s still a lot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember, we also need to have funds for the programs and operational costs.\u201d The race is on to pull the various pieces together for a soft launch. On top of refurbishment plans to be redrawn, costed and commenced, an exhibition director (historian and Chinese art and photography curator Shuxia Chen) has been drafted to conceptualise the museum\u2019s first exhibition, which will focus on local stories about Haymarket habitants that have been there for generations, such as the Lam family of Asian grocer Dong Nam A, or the Pang family, which ran a Chinese restaurant in Haymarket for nearly three decades and have donated large sums to the museum. \u201cWe must put on a good show for people,\u201d Cai said. Decisions need to be made about the exhibition\u2019s budget. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about special lighting, casings, you have to hire expert consultants to put it all together. It\u2019s not as easy as hanging something on a wall.\u201d Meanwhile, Kelly is hustling for donations, having visited Canberra to lobby Wong and Plibersek, and sharing bank details in community newsletters. \u201cI\u2019ve been lobbied about this so much,\u201d Wong said at the April event.\n\nThe museum has secured its tenancy for another decade, which Kelly hopes will help to encourage donations after hearing feedback that some felt reluctant to donate money for a building that belongs to the council. \u201cA refit is not as sexy to the philanthropic community,\u201d said another former board member, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe spoke to a lot of other Chinese museums around the world ... The Chinese Canadian Museum took eight years to get running from conceptualisation to open doors. It just takes a little while.\u201d Cai is excited to showcase the many contributions of Chinese Australians over the decades and is at pains to convey the \u201ccomplicated nature\u201d of the project to supporters, whom he said had been generous and full of goodwill. \u201cI can empathise with some of our supporters who just want to see the building open soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI want as much as I can to speed things up.\u201d",

        "text": "Speaking of depth, keep an eye on Hawthorn. It was exciting to see the return of Mitch Lewis against Port Adelaide, with Changkuoth Jiath, Jack Scrimshaw, Max Ramsden and Luke Breust all lining up in the VFL. Josh Weddle and Will Day are also edging closer to return, while Mabior Chol was rested with soreness. That kind of internal pressure drives standards. It\u2019s clear Sam Mitchell is still figuring out his best 22, and no one is safe. That uncertainty is keeping the Hawks hungry. Defensive identity Finals footy is brutal: contested, chaotic, and relentless. The best teams know now is the time to tighten up defensively \u2013 and test their systems under pressure. Collingwood and Adelaide are elite at restricting scores, both from stoppage and turnover. It starts up the ground \u2013 forwards and mids swarm, forcing rushed entries. Defenders win one-on-ones, set up behind the ball, and squeeze territory. It\u2019s connected, high-IQ footy. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs should be on high alert. Now sitting one game behind eighth-placed Gold Coast, they\u2019ve conceded more points than any other team in the top nine, despite boasting the league\u2019s highest-scoring attack. Their offensive firepower is clear, but it\u2019s defence that wins premierships.\n\nRight now, they\u2019re losing over half of their one-on-one contests in defensive 50, a clear sign the ball is coming in too hot and too often. That\u2019s not sustainable come finals, when games tighten up and scoring dries up. You can patch defensive issues in-season, but pressure always finds cracks. Over the next few weeks you\u2019ll see teams are also rehearsing their game modes \u2013 the tactical switches that control momentum. Think tempo shifts, kick-mark, boundary plays, skinny-side set-ups, or throwing a forward behind the ball late. It all gets tested now so that, hopefully, it will be second nature when it counts. The Bulldogs score heavily but need to tighten their defence. Credit: AFL Photos Chris Scott keeps evolving Geelong\u2019s gears. One week they have 165 marks in a slow build-up game. The next, they play direct and daring. Their ability to adjust to the opposition makes them dangerous, but the round 18 loss to GWS showed they\u2019re not quite humming yet. Expect more tinkering in the weeks ahead. The best teams know these tactical shifts must come from their on-field leaders, not coaches. That\u2019s what separates the serious contenders from the pack.\n\nDress rehearsals Much has been made of Geelong\u2019s soft run home, but is it really the advantage it\u2019s made out to be? A soft draw doesn\u2019t always prepare a team well for finals. If anything, it can rob them of the chance to become battle-hardened. The expectation is to win, and win well \u2013 and that kind of pressure can be deceptive. It might improve your ladder position, but it doesn\u2019t forge the grit needed in September. But for a team like GWS, simply trying to consolidate its position, a softer fixture is gold. Their win over Geelong in round 18 kept their season alive. Every winnable game builds momentum, and momentum builds belief. Is Geelong\u2019s soft run home really an advantage? Credit: Getty Images Friday night\u2019s clash between Brisbane and the Bulldogs was massive \u2013 and so was the finish to Collingwood\u2019s loss to Fremantle. These were finals dress rehearsals: high-pressure, contested, and played with high stakes. Games like these expose flaws and test systems. A statement win sends shockwaves \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what Fremantle and Adelaide delivered, laying down the law against fellow top-eight contenders.\n\nLoading Gold Coast did it in round 18. They brought fierce, forward-half pressure that unsettled Collingwood \u2013 and it worked. That was no fluke. They played with the intensity needed in big moments. And it told the rest of the comp: \u201cwe\u2019re not just here to compete\u201d. Still, they stumbled against Adelaide on Sunday \u2013 a reminder of just how hard it is to back up finals-like footy week in, week out. Brisbane play four of the final top eight teams in the next five weeks. Their fixture is brutal \u2013 Suns, Pies, Freo and the Hawks. It will either forge them or fry them. The same goes for the Hawks, who have Adelaide, Collingwood and the Lions. You can\u2019t simulate finals intensity on the training track. You can\u2019t smash your teammates three weeks out from finals. You need real-game exposure. If you don\u2019t get it? The first final hits like a truck.\n\nA constant fight Every game for the top nine has the power to reshape both the top four and the eight. Even Sydney, sitting 10th, are applying pressure. And don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 the ladder can hide as much as it reveals. Take Gold Coast. They\u2019ve played one fewer game, with a catch-up match still to come against the wounded Bombers. That gives them more flexibility than a glance at the ladder shows. For everyone else, it\u2019s survival mode. No luxury of load management. No room for slip-ups. The Suns have a game in hand on the rest of the contenders. Credit: AFL Photos Teams either win the games they should, or stack pressure on themselves into the next week. The Bulldogs felt that after their loss to Adelaide, and now it\u2019s compounded after falling to the Lions.\n\nHawthorn would\u2019ve felt it, too, after slipping up against Freo. They responded with a strong win over Port. Who knows, that final spot could be decided in round 24, with a cluster of mini elimination finals. At this stage of the season, every miss carries consequences. There\u2019s no room left to stumble. But there\u2019s a cost to playing high-pressure footy for five straight weeks just to scrape in. What\u2019s left in the tank when you finally get there? That\u2019s the risk. These teams aren\u2019t just fighting to simply make the finals \u2013 they\u2019re fighting to arrive in one piece. Whether their energy holds or burns out could decide their whole finals series. Crunch time\n\nLoading This is the stretch that separates the good from the great. Having been part of three premiership campaigns, I know this is when leaders matter most. Margins shrink. Stakes rise. And while there\u2019s still time to tweak and improve, the best teams are already asking: Where are the cracks, and how do we fix them? What are our strengths \u2013 and how do we harness them? Yes, luck always plays a part. But ladder position matters. Finishing high saves energy in September \u2013 home finals, the finals draw you land \u2013 these things shape your path. And they can be the difference on the final day.",

It is such a privilege to sit either in the House of Representatives or the Senate. And it is something that none of us should ever take for granted. And it is an honour each and every day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first parliamentary sitting since the May election begins on tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second term of Albanese government will see Labor with an increased majority, holding 94 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives after a landslide election win in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 40 politicians are entering parliament for the first time.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness leaders in Tasmania have urged politicians to work together to overcome the hurdle of a hung parliament - and resume parliamentary activity soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's election was the state's fourth in seven years \u2013 and the second in two years, brought on by a motion of no confidence in Premier Jeremy Rockliff in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has returned the result of another hung parliament, with neither major party winning the 18 seats required to rule as a majority government.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiations are underway to finalise a power sharing arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Michael Bailey says political uncertainty is hurting businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is time for Parliament to get back to work. This has been a huge distraction for Tasmanian business, for investment and it is time that we see the Parliament back working again.

We simply need parliament to get back - and to get on with the job of leading Tasmania.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report has found Australians living with chronic pain continue to suffer from stigma, with 74 per cent feeling ignored or dismissed; and 48 per cent experiencing prejudice from health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research released by Chronic Pain Australia surveyed 5,000 Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found nearly three-quarters of chronic pain sufferers experience mental health issues as a result of their pain, while nearly two-thirds are unable to work and experience financial strain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chairperson of Chronic Pain Australia, Nicolette Ellis, says with around 3.6 million Australians impacted by chronic pain, more effort needs to be made to ensure people can get help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chronic pain is a complex condition to treat and it usually needs a team of health professionals, with different skillsets to help build that person's toolkit. Unfortunately, in the National Pain Report we saw that only 18 per cent of people are referred to what we call multidisciplinary care where they can get access to those different health professionals to help support their care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report calls on the federal government to make chronic pain a national priority through changes like providing more localised funding to primary care and the coding system to recognise it as a health condition.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nExit polls show Japan's ruling coalition is likely to lose its majority in the upper house, with 75 uncontested seats out of the 125 needed to maintain control.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vote does not determine whether prime minister Shigeru Ishiba's minority Liberal Democratic Party remains in power, but increases the pressure on the leader, after the bloc lost its majority in the lower house following elections in October.\n\n\n\n\n\nA loss at this election would mark the first time in the history of the party that it leads a coalition that does not control either house, and would likely result in calls for Mr Ishiba to step down.\n\n\n\n\n\nRising prices, low incomes and burdensome social security payments are among key issues for voters.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sport, former world number one Venus Williams is preparing for her return to professional tennis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 16 months away from the sport, the seven-time Grand Slam champion is competing in the Washington Open [[Mon 21 July local time]].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 45-year-old has won the Wimbledon singles title five times and the US Open twice, as well as 14 Grand Slam women's doubles titles alongside her younger sister Serena.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has not competed since the Miami Open in March 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe faces fellow American Peyton Stearns in the first round of the Washington Open today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams says after time away, her definition of success has shifted.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australian star Michael Storer has bagged the much-coveted daily combativity prize for being the most aggressive rider after his constant attacks enlivened a thrilling afternoon on the 15th stage of the Tour de France.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Perth rider's illustrious Tudor Pro teammate Julian Alaphilippe will want to forget the embarrassment of celebrating a stage win in the ancient city of Carcassonne, which he later discovered was actually only a third-place finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 169km route from Muret, the race had actually already been won by UAE Team Emirates' veteran Tim Wellens, wearing the Belgian champion's jersey, with compatriot Victor Campenaerts (Visma Lease-A-Bike) second in a fitting one-two on the eve of Monday's rest day, which is Belgium's National Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair had both been in the breakaway with the buzzing Storer but the Australian was eventually swallowed up amid the sprint for third, won by Alaphilippe, who celebrated as though he had won the stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlas, the former double world champion had been without a working radio due to an early crash, during which he had also dislocated his shoulder, so hadn't realised the two Belgians were ahead.\n\n\n\n\"I tried to put in the best sprint possible and thought about the stage win. Like an idiot, I raised my hands, but there were a few guys ahead of me,\" the 33-year-old later told French television while also revealing he had put his dislocated shoulder back himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remembered what they did to me in the hospital previously and managed to pop it back in,\" Alaphilippe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The day could have gone better \u2014 but I could also have had to go home, so it's okay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Raphael Meyer, CEO of the Swiss-based Tudor team, pointed out they would have been very happy with third if offered that before the stage, he also paid tribute to Storer's \"amazing\" ride after the 28-year-old had come home among the pack of sprinters behind Alaphilippe in 22nd place.\n\n\n\nFurther back, there was no change at the top of the general classification, with the main favourites finishing some six minutes after Wellens, following a few exhausting days in the high mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\nTadej Poga\u010dar remains four minutes 13 seconds clear of Jonas Vingegaard (Visma Lease-A-Bike) with Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull\u2013Bora\u2013Hansgrohe) third, just shy of eight minutes off yellow.\n\n\n\nBen O'Connor remains the top Australian in the standings in 12th place, 25:44 behind Poga\u010dar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day's breakaway had formed after the crash had split the peloton. With Vingegaard and Lipowitz delayed, UAE and Poga\u010dar tried to slow the peloton to enable them to catch up \u2014 mirroring a similar sporting response by his rivals when he crashed a few days ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakaway was gradually whittled down to four with Storer attempting to go solo at that point, only to be reeled back in.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a little over 40km to go, the leading group was eight-strong, at which point Wellens, who had been sitting on the others' wheels, launched his break which quickly became decisive as the rest dithered over how to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a very special victory,\" said Wellens, after his maiden Tour win. \"Everybody knows the Tour de France, everybody wants to ride the Tour de France but not many get to win at the Tour de France, so it's very beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n",

He was not contagious on the return journey to Australia from Africa, and those close contacts that he has been in contact including at the emergency ward and other locations are being contact traced right now and identified.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Queensland's Health Minister Tim Nicholls, confirming a new strain of mpox virus has been detected in a man who's just returned to the south-east of the state from a trip to Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Mpox is a disease caused by the monkeypox virus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mpox is not easily spread. It is only spread or it can only spread through close or intimate contact. It is particularly spread by close sexual contact and particularly for gay men and people engaging with sex is the primary cause of the contagious spread.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Geoffrey Playford is the head of infectious diseases at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the rare Clade 1 strain of mpox has only been seen once before in Australia, also in a returned traveller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the last year and a half in Queensland, we've had 135 cases in mpox clade 2 - this is the first case of clade 1 and the second time in Australia we've had clade 1. The other case was in New South Wales in May.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Nicholls says the public should NOT be concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think that there are 19 community contacts and 40 staff contacts that have been in contact with the patient. At the moment his symptoms are asymptomatic. They are not showing any signs of the clade 1 mpox, but they are isolating. The family involves children in high school, primary school and childcare centres and the high school, primary school and childcare centres either have been or are in the process of being identified.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Playford says authorities are not worried either.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says fortunately in this case the clinical presentation is relatively mild and there are no particular concerns for the patient's health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And all of our efforts at the moment is to identify contacts using national guidelines to undertake quarantine where the very close contacts have been identified, again in line with the national guidelines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe close contacts will be offered a vaccine that is highly effective against mpox -either preventing or making the disease significantly milder and shorter.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Nicholls says over a year ago there were some restrictions on the availability of the vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now, Queensland has ample supplies - and the vaccine is provided free of charge through sexual health clinics and some GPs [[general practitioners]].\n\n\n\n",

Scientists predict that 95 per cent of the country will be underwater at high tide by the year 2100.\n\n\n\nIn response, Australia and Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union \u2014 a landmark climate and security pact, opening visa pathways for 280 Tuvalu citizens to be granted permanent residency in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ballot , which closed on the 18th of July, drew 5,157 applicants \u2014 roughly half of Tuvalu's population.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaleiga hopes members of her family will win the lottery and join her in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am very excited. I have four sisters in Tuvalu. I'm trying to get all of them over,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just feel I would love to have a sibling, a sister, closer with me here, staying next to me.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the young people who could outlive their own country\n\nThe Australian government said the agreement was \"the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world that recognises that Tuvalu's statehood and sovereignty will continue, notwithstanding the impacts of climate change-related sea level rise\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Neemia family hopes they can return home to Tuvalu one day \u2014 if there's anything left to return to.\n\n\n\nHopes to return home\n\nThe Falepili Mobility Pathway ballot allows 280 Tuvaluans each year to live, work and study in Australia. Those selected gain access to subsidised education and child care, Medicare, and other government support, such as the family tax benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven Tuvalu's national population is only around 11,000, some have speculated that the entire country could migrate to Australia within a generation if demand for the visa continues.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacific Minister Pat Conroy says the visa is different from most permanent resident pathways because it allows more freedom of movement.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Strong demand from Tuvalu for Australian residency as visa lottery closes SBS News 19/07/2025 04:56 English\n\nNormally, unlimited travel for permanent residents is capped at five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a world's first approach to a relationship between two countries,\" Conroy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're responding to a request from the Tuvaluan government for migration with dignity. And so, we do envision that a fair number of Tuvalans will come to Australia out of a population of around 11,000.\"\n\n\n\n'Hopefully it's still there when we retire'\n\nThe Neemia family moved to Queensland 25 years ago, raising their family in Brisbane. But the plan was always to return home.\n\n\n\n\n\nLailega's husband Tupa hopes they'll be able to retire in Tuvalu \u2014 if it still exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The plan was to come and work, when the kids grow up, we'd retire in Tuvalu,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully it's still there when we retire.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Tuvalu is building a digital replica of itself in the metaverse\n\nAlopi Latukefu, director of the Global Centre for Social Justice and Advocacy Leadership, said climate change is already being felt across Tuvalu's nine atolls scattered across the Pacific between Australia and Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing these communities faced with real challenges in the community from the perspective of not just inundation from the sea level rise, but also in terms of food security, water security in these communities, the impact from regular events \u2014 whether they be king tides or more serious events \u2014 that are creating a very difficult situation,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's important to understand that not everyone wants to leave Tuvalu and that it's important Tuvaluans are supported to maintain their connection to their lands and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision to leave is a very big one and a very important one, and one which is tied to a range of other factors as well to support their families, to provide a pathway for a future, to have access to education, to have access to things that are part of the opportunity that Australia represents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some may feel they have little choice.\n\n\n\nSupporting fossil fuels 'immoral and unacceptable', says Tuvalu minister\n\nIn 2025-26, Australia committed $47 million in development assistance for Tuvalu, including for climate adaptation, telecommunications, infrastructure, health and education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat includes support for Tuvalu's Coastal Adaptation Project, which implements measures such as beach nourishment, concrete and rock revetments, and sea walls to reduce the impact of rising seas.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australia has faced criticism from some Pacific leaders for its continued investment in fossil fuels \u2014 which contribute to the very climate change Tuvalu is fighting.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why over a third of this nation's citizens want to migrate to Australia\n\nThis year, Labor provisionally approved a 40-year extension of the North West Shelf , Australia's largest gas project.\n\n\n\n\n\nVanuatu's minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, called the project extension a \"slap in the face\" for Pacific Island nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have continued to make it very clear to Australia that we expect them to stop approving any new oil and gas projects,\" Regenvanu said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuvalu's Climate Minister Maina Vakafua Talia has also urged Australia to curb its emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Opening and subsidising and exporting fossil fuels is immoral and unacceptable,\" Talia said.\n\n\n\nA 2024 report by Climate Analytics, commissioned by the Australian Human Rights Institute, found no evidence Australia is \"transitioning away\" from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, it was the third-largest exporter of primary fossil fuels globally \u2014 behind only Russia and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia ranked second for exported emissions due to the scale of its coal exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nConroy says Australia remains a conscientious neighbour, mindful of climate change.\n\n\n\nTuvalu just the beginning\n\nA 2024 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report found that 90 million displaced people are now living in countries with high to extreme exposure to climate hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2040, the number of countries in that category is expected to rise from three to 65.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid growing climate change risks, the Australian government introduced the Pacific Engagement Visa , which offers 3,000 visas to nationals from participating Pacific countries and Timor-Leste.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Locals of these Australian islands say they fear the impact of rising seas\n\nUp to 100 Tuvaluans were eligible through the first ballot. Final discussions are underway on participation for the second round, expected to open later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visa also allows recipients to return to their home countries freely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm really focused on making sure those first 3,000 settle visa grantees have the best possible experience of coming to Australia, and then we'll just see where the numbers go. But at the moment, our policy is 3,000 places a year,\" Conroy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the transition can be difficult, as Laleiga well knows, she is reasonably optimistic for the prospects of incoming Tuvaluans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As long as they're aware of what it's going to be like with the help of the people already settled here. I think they're going to be okay.\"\n\n\n\n",

Also turning wood into musical instruments is just amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, luthiers - makers of string instruments like violins and cellos - are associated with Europe, where masters like Antonio Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri shaped the modern violin.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the craft has spread globally, with thriving communities of luthiers in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, in his warmly-lit studio cluttered with chunks of wood, chisels and jars of varnishes, Tan is nurturing the tradition in his own country - his workshop now making around 10 instruments a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, in the workshop, there is seven workbench, so they are all occupied. This takes forever, because it is never complete, just like your car, you can polish every day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a computer science graduate who doesn\u2019t play the violin, Tan\u2019s path to violin-making was unconventional.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was helping in his family\u2019s food business and co-owned a music school in 2010, when he made a trip to China to have an ageing violin restored.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trip sparked Tan's fascination with the craft, and led him to undergo an apprenticeship with Chinese instrument maker Han Zhao Sheng.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt first, it was just that I find it really interesting, why not just make one violin? It's just that after completing the first violin, I knew this craft is for me, and I like it a lot and yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTan flew back and forth to Beijing for more training, then travelled to Italy to study the craft further.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, Tan has earned international accolades for his craftsmanship, and now, he mentors a new generation of makers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most of his students are musicians and young people, Tan says few pursue it as a trade due to the demands of the craft, and the domestic market still being small.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, some have followed in Tan's footsteps, including Chan Song Jie, Malaysia's first female luthier.\n\n\n\n\n\nTan says those who have decided to pursue the craft professionally make up a small but dedicated community, and one he hopes will continue to grow.\n\n\n\n",

Usually, we see problems of mould in warehouses and in other collections. But due to global warming, it is expected that more and more insect infestations will appear.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drugstore beetle, also known as the bread beetle, is often found among foodstuffs like grains, flour, spices, and other dried products.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they are also attracted to the gelatine and starch-based adhesives found in old books.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hajdu believes the effects of climate change have played a role in spurring the beetle infestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Higher temperatures are favourable for the life of insects. They are quite inactive below 20 degrees Celsius. Below that, their activity slows down; above that, they\u2019re more active. The persistently greater heat leads to more life cycles per year than in cooler periods. In warmer conditions, the reproduction cycle of the drugstore beetle can be up to four per year compared to only two in cooler weather.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beetle invasion was first detected during a routine cleaning of the library, when employees noticed unusual layers of dust on the shelves and then saw that holes had been burrowed into some of the book spines.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon opening the volumes, burrow holes could be seen in the paper where the beetles had chewed through.\n\n\n\n\n\nIlona \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi says everyone is heartbroken at the prospect of losing books because of the infestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I see a book chewed up by a beetle or infested in any other way, I feel that no matter how many copies are published and how replaceable the book is, a piece of culture has been lost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Abbey's restoration workers are trying hard to avoid that possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're removing roughly 100,000 hand-bound books from the shelves and carefully placing them in crates.\n\n\n\n\n\nZs\u00f3fia Hajdu says so many books are being taken down because the infestation has been detected in several parts of the library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an advanced insect infestation which has been detected in several parts of the library, so the entire collection is classified as infected and must be treated all at the same time. We have to remove all the books from the shelves, put them into boxes, then into hermetically sealed plastic sacks. Inside them, an anoxic disinfection process takes place. Basically, we create an oxygen-free environment in which insects perish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that process is done - and before being reshelved - each book will be individually inspected and vacuumed, and any book damaged by the pests will be set aside for later restoration work.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Dutch rider Thymen Arensman won the Tour de France's toughest stage after a long solo effort over mammoth climbs but Tadej Pogacar increased his overall lead on Sunday AEST.\n\n\n\n\n\nArensman, who rides for Ineos-Grenadiers, posted the biggest victory of his career. After crossing the finish line in the deep fog enveloping the ski resort of Superbagneres, Arensman lay exhausted on the road with his head in his hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went solo with 37km left from a breakaway, and quickly opened a comfortable lead. He started the final ascent to Superbagneres, which is more than 12km long, on his own and resisted the return of the main contenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Arensman's second Grand Tour stage win, having previously won a stage at the 2022 Spanish Vuelta.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Arensman posed no threat to the overall standings, Pogacar and his teammates controlled the race from the back. The yellow jersey holder and his main challenger, Jonas Vingegaard, trailed by around three minutes with 8km remaining.\n\n\n\nVingegaard tried a move with 4km left but Pogacar responded with ease. The two rivals then watched each other closely and Arensman crossed first at the summit, more than one minute ahead of the duo.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving won the previous two stages in the Pyrenees, Pogacar settled for second place. He accelerated in the final section to gain more time on Vingegaard, who completed the podium.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Pogacar increased his lead over Vingegaard to 4 minutes, 13 seconds, with Florian Lipowitz in third place, 7:53 off the pace after Remco Evenepoel abandoned his race.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvenepoel, who was third overall, struggled early on as the peloton faced another day of suffering on climbs that are part of the Tour's lore such as the Col du Tourmalet, the Col d'Aspin, Col de Peyresourde and Superbagneres.\n\n\n\nThe Olympic champion was dropped on the ascent of the Tourmalet. Evenepoel won the stage five time trial but suffered in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter struggling during Friday's uphill race against the clock to Peyragudes, he managed to keep his third place in the general classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBen O'Connor was the highest finishing Australian rider, in 16th place, with Callum Scotson 19th. O'Connor is in 12th position overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a spectator was hit by a car from the Ineos-Grenadiers team on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTV footage showed the team car knocking down the fan, who was holding what looked liked a mobile phone, close to the top of the Col de Peyresourde.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle was following riders on the steep ascent and driving at moderate speed. There was no immediate information available on the spectator's condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race jury later said Ineos-Grenadiers sports director Oliver Cookson was fined the equivalent of just under A$10,000 for \"improper behaviour endangering spectators\" and handed a yellow card. Accumulating yellow cards over a defined period of time results in a suspension.\n\n\n\n\n\nIneos-Grenadiers apologised \"to the fan who was accidentally and regretfully struck by one of our race cars while supporting the riders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like all teams we take great care to maintain a safe race environment for everyone, including the passionate fans who make our sport so special.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRiders will leave the high mountains on Sunday's stage during a 169km ride from Muret to the medieval city of Carcassonne.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race finishes next weekend in Paris.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nShark Bay or Gathaagudu is on Australia's most westerly point.\n\n\n\nA world heritage area where the bronzed earth meets turquoise waters abundant with marine life.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you'll find turtles, dugongs, whale, dolphins and scattered across the sea floor a coveted delicacy containing centuries of seafaring history.\n\n\n\nThe sea cucumber is Australia's first ever export.\n\n\n\nFrom the early 1700s, Makassan fisherman, from the island of Sulawesi - now Indonesia - sailed the trade winds south to Arnhem Land to trade with Aboriginal people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From what the records show, they used to swap sea cucumbers for iron for their spears. So I thought it was incredible that there was a trade before colonisation and you can actually record it. So why not try and recreate it?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Malgana Traditional Owner Michael Wear.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe heads an Indigenous-owned business which is reviving the ancient industry. Tidal Moon draws on traditional knowledge to harvest sea cucumbers sustainably.\n\n\n\nHand-picked, one by one, the marine animal will soon be dried and processed at a brand-new export facility in the West Australian town of Denham. And then they're sent to a Singaporean partner for export across South East Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTidal Moon also has its sights set on Western markets, with emerging research highlighting the potential health benefits of the marine animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hope is that as the business scales up, so too will employment opportunities in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The lack of indigenous people in the commercial fishing industry is so, so unfortunate. If you can create a business that's sustainable, that's culturally directed, you can create jobs and a middle class within small coastal towns.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2017, the company has trained around a dozen Indigenous divers, including 28 year old Malgana and Amangu man Alex Dodd - the company's lead diver\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tidal Moon, what it's actually doing is making that middle class ground so people can move back home and have jobs and then buy a house, settle down with their family and kids up here and move back home. A lot of the time you get young fellas that grow up here and then they're moving away going to the mines or going to Perth or something like that because it's not sustainable for them to work here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation is also at the heart of the business\n\n\n\nGathaagudu is home to the planet's largest reserve of seagrass both a food source for marine life and a carbon storage powerhouse\n\n\n\nBut more than a quarter was razed in a marine heatwave in 2011, and it's still recovering while also grappling with a new heatwave. In February, the waters were four degrees warmer than usual.\n\n\n\nTidal Moon is leading one of the world's largest seagrass restoration projects. While scouring the seafloor for sea cucumbers, the divers also replant seagrass reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the key things that we're trying to do is keep the carbon captured in the sea floor. So without seagrass restoration, you have these carbon bombs that go off and there's about 40 million tons of CO2 that are at risk in Shark Bay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team have also catalogued over 4000 hours of footage \u2013 a 'living library' of marine observations noticing a symbiotic relationship between the seagrass and sea cucumbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Verduin, a marine scientist at Perth\u2019s Murdoch University, agrees that the relationship might be \u201cmutually beneficial,\u201d saying sea cucumbers are 'the worms of the ocean.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The function of sea cucumbers overturning the soil and redistributing nutrients. It's very good to get those nutrients in within the sediment. So it's good for the seagrasses and they grow better. But seagrasses, in turn, also then protect the sea cucumbers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Tidal Moon\u2019s divers, have a \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201ccircular\u201d way of approaching marine conservation.\n\n",

Wages in NSW grew by 131.1 per cent between September 1997 and March 2025.\n\n\n\nWages growth in Australia has failed to keep pace with the increased cost of housing. Source: SBS News\n\nWomen are more likely to work now\n\nSocial researcher Mark McCrindle points out that women in their early 30s \u2014 an age when many would be having children \u2014 are now twice as likely to be working compared to their own mothers at the same age.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains: \"77 per cent of women in their early 30s are in the labour force \u2014 it was less than a third a generation ago.\"\n\n\n\nEmployment for women aged in their 30s once dropped sharply but now it barely dips. Source: SBS News Based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Time Use Survey, conducted between November 2020 and July 2021, McCrindle notes that a third of Australians also report feeling rushed or pressed for time often or always.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 38 per cent of women reported this, and 32 per cent of men.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen aged 35 to 44 years were the group most likely to report feeling rushed for time (55 per cent).\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Cheryll tried to get pregnant for years. One thing sealed her decision to stop\n\nMcCrindle says working from home is seen as a way of reducing that stress or time pressure, as workplaces are traditionally located in CBDs well away from where people live, and where schools, childcare, shopping and other family and social connections are located.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rising cost of housing has pushed people even further away from workplaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only way to really make all of that work is to have less time conducting that commute, and that's where I think work from home achieves that,\" McCrindle says.\n\n\n\nWork from home has become a lifeline for parents\n\nYusuf, whose daughter is now seven years old, has been promoted to the senior leadership team at her work, and says her experiences motivated her to support flexibility for employees returning from maternity leave, so they can return to work in a way that makes them comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[There's] no clock watching, so you're not making sure people arrive at a certain time or leave at a certain time,\" she says.\n\n\n\nI've heard of businesses saying you need to prove that you've got child care \u2014 somebody in the house helping you with the child \u2014 in order to be paid for this day of work.\n\n\"We don't do anything like that because we just know that our people will make it work.,\" Yusuf says.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes flexible work arrangements will ultimately enable women to take on leadership roles while still allowing them to be the parents they aspire to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know a lot of women in senior roles who have the house husband or the au pair, but I don't want to miss out on that time with my child,\" she says.\n\n\n\nEb Yusuf is ambitious about her career but doesn't want to miss out on spending time with her daughter.

They know that I want to do a good job and I'll get it done,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether it's [because I'm clocking on] outside of work hours or whether I just do it quicker ... because I'm a mum and I need to be efficient with my time.\"\n\n\n\n'I just love my life so much more'\n\nKerrie Cullimore, 41, has 12-year-old twins and says she left her previous job because the demands of full-time work and commuting for almost three hours a day were unsustainable with young children.\n\n\n\n\n\nCullimore says it felt like work took up a huge part of her life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was gone from the house for like 13 hours a day or something ridiculous.

This is horrible'.\n\nCullimore, who found a part-time role closer to home in the finance department of a media company, says being allowed to work remotely meant her family could make a life-changing move from Sydney to Port Stephens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can take my dog for a walk in the morning, the kids get on the bus [just outside my house], I'm here in the afternoon when the kids get home [and] I can make dinner,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can jump on and off online depending on my work schedule, and I just love my life so much more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arrangement is also beneficial for her employers as she logs in every day, even though she has a part-time role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I had to go into the office, I would definitely go in for the three days only,\" she says.\n\n\n\nKerrie Cullimore loves her life after working from home enabled her family to move to Port Stephens.

It enables older workers to help out with grandkids and those who are neurodivergent to participate in the workplace more fully.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may also help parents who don't want to put their children in childcare to manage care with help from grandparents or extended family while continuing to work. Mothers may also be able to breastfeed for a longer period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bigger picture has to be beyond purely GDP [gross domestic product] measures to the other social measures of wellbeing, social fabric, engaged family, and investment in the next generation,\" McCrindle says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any flexible practices that can help accommodate that, I think, is an investment in the future.\"\n\n\n\n",

After being diagnosed with ADHD while living in the United States, he returned home \u2014 and found he needed to start his diagnosis journey from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was already diagnosed, already on the medication, had the documentation. I thought it was going to be pretty straightforward. And for me, it was a challenge,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I ever would've made it through the process if I were starting in Australia from the get-go because of the massive hurdles and burdens required with getting through the process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAltman's struggles reflect a broader issue when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in Australia: despite rising awareness and demand, the system is still playing catch-up \u2014 and some states are lagging behind.\n\n\n\nZac Altman says he would never have founded his ADHD telehealth business if he hadn't struggled with the diagnosis process himself. Source: Supplied\n\nA postcode lottery\n\nAll states and territories have different laws governing how stimulant medications \u2014 commonly prescribed to treat ADHD \u2014 can be prescribed and dispensed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some places, the process is more streamlined. In others, patients face stricter regulatory barriers \u2014 often accompanied by longer wait times and higher costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Roger Paterson, a psychiatrist based in Western Australia, said there was \"always a postcode privilege for all levels of healthcare\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ADHD treatment is no different,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said ADHD diagnosis and treatment rates have surged in Australia \u2014 but not uniformly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're still below the prevalence rates \u2026 but some states and territories have caught up quicker than others.\" Paterson told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterson said South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and the Northern Territory remain the slowest to catch up, while Western Australia \u2014 which once lagged behind \u2014 has now reached similar levels to Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No-one really knows why [some states lag], beyond the NT not having many specialists \u2014 paediatricians or psychiatrists. But they are all gradually catching up to the ADHD prevalence rates.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevalence refers to the proportion of a population that is affected by ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are no Australian adult prevalence studies of ADHD using the current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, some studies have indicated the prevalence of ADHD in Australia is likely to be similar to that found internationally \u2014 between 2 and 6 per cent of the population, according to the Australasian ADHD Professionals Association.\n\n\n\nRates of prescribing vary across states and territories, reflecting the different jurisdictional laws about stimulant prescribing. Source: SBS News Additionally, the federal government's Drug Utilisation Sub Committee September 2023 report found differences in the rates of prescribing across states and territories, which the report says reflects different laws across jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdult rates of prescribing were significantly higher in Western Australia and the ACT compared to the other states and the Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Senate inquiry into ADHD, handed down in November 2023, examined the barriers to consistent, timely and best-practice assessment of ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt heard those living in regional and rural areas were subject to even more barriers to care, with reduced access to specialists, longer wait times and higher costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAltman said the differences were most pronounced in Kantoko clients moving interstate who had to navigate different jurisdictional regulations, sometimes requiring them to find an entirely new specialist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems somewhat unreasonable to expect every psychiatrist to know every quirk across the country ... which is why I would argue we should have some sort of national standard around this stuff,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA patchwork system with no national rules\n\nAltman said going through the assessment process in Australia can feel like \"a roll of the dice\" due to a lack of national rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he paid about $1,500 out of pocket to be rediagnosed in his first year back in Australia \u2014 including an upfront $1,000 fee to secure a psychiatrist appointment in NSW. He said he was fortunate to have leftover medication from the US to tide him over in the months he waited, but he knows others aren't so lucky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the luck of the draw,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry heard that of those who did have positive experiences of ADHD assessment and diagnosis, \"many attributed their experience to luck\" or to doctors and psychiatrists who helped them access services.\n\n\n\nThere is no national framework for ADHD, despite it being a key recommendation in the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry heard wait times were found to be \"significant\", typically between six and 18 months for an initial appointment, while the Australian Association of Psychologists Inc said the number of mental health professionals has not kept up with the demand for services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe public system rarely treats the condition except in children, pushing adults seeking a diagnosis to the private sector. As specialists set their own fees with no cap, people can be subject to high fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ADHD Foundation said it had observed some professionals charge up to $5,000 for assessments.\n\n\n\n'Kantoko wouldn't exist if Australia nailed it'\n\nIn response, ADHD telehealth services like Kantoko have cropped up. Operating completely online, these clinics promise shorter wait times \u2014 but sometimes at a greater cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nKantoko operates under a subscription model. Medicare does not cover any fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn exchange, patients are promised an ADHD assessment by a qualified psychiatrist, follow-up appointments with mental health doctors and prescription renewals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kantoko wouldn't exist if Australia had nailed it,\" Altman said. \"I wouldn't have gotten so frustrated that I started this business and embarked on this journey if it were easy-to-access and affordable.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Autism and ADHD frequently overlap. People living with both can feel misunderstood\n\nBut the Senate inquiry heard concerns about the growing telehealth service model, saying that while it was helpful for those in regional areas, it has also driven up risks associated with \"inadequate assessment and misdiagnosis\", according to the Australian College of Mental Health Nurses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canberra and Queanbeyan ADHD Support Group, a volunteer-run local group, said the clinics offered \"exceedingly high fees delivering a quick turnaround\" with concerns of \"price gouging\".\n\n\n\nThe GP debate: solving shortages or lowering the bar?\n\nAs the system plays catch-up, a key recommendation from the inquiry was the development of uniform and nationally consistent ADHD prescribing rules \u2014 the only recommendation of the 15 that the government accepted in full.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government said the establishment of prescribing arrangements, including increased GP involvement, was a matter for state and territory governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW, ACT, SA and WA have committed to reforms that will allow specially trained GPs to prescribe ADHD medication independently from 2025 and 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey'll join jurisdictions like Queensland, where GPs have been able to prescribe certain ADHD medications for children without prior approval since 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some say it could ease bottlenecks and encourage holistic care, others warn it risks lowering the standards of care.\n\n\n\nPaterson said the current model is for specialists to handle diagnosis and stabilisation, before shifting to a shared care arrangement with GPs \u2014 known as co-prescribing. He's sceptical of political moves to shift ADHD treatment onto GPs in an effort to play catch-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some GPs have pushed for taking on initial, independent assessment and prescribing, and politicians push this along as a popular way of reducing waiting lists,\" Paterson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This creates a tension between reducing waitlists with more GP involvement on the one hand, but on the other hand, accepting that GP ADHD management may not have the nuance of specialist management.\"\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that relaxing GP restrictions could open the door to so-called 'dexy clinics' \u2014 where stimulant medications such as dexamphetamines might be handed out too freely, similar to concerns seen with medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There would be less concern about lower GP numbers who are highly trained, and more concern about higher GP numbers who are less trained,\" Paterson said. \"The worst case scenario is that stimulant medication becomes as accessible as cannabis from the medicinal cannabis clinics.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Alison Poulton, a senior lecturer in paediatrics at The University of Sydney and member of ADHD Australia's advisory board, pushed back against 'dexy clinic' fears, saying that ongoing relationships between GPs and patients would reduce risk and encourage more holistic care.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe criticised current restrictions requiring specialist endorsement and fixed dosage limits, arguing they undermine both patient autonomy and the ability of GPs to tailor care.\n\n\n\n\"It makes complete nonsense of patient autonomy,\" she said. \"Decisions should be made between the GP and patient, not based on a letter written five years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPoulton emphasised that GPs, who often have a long-term understanding of their patients, are well placed to make prescribing decisions that reflect changing needs, leading to better functional outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the GPs are going to do a much better job if they know it's up to them to make these prescribing decisions rather than to have to consult the specialist.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAt polling booths across Tasmania, the obligatory democracy sausage was selling like hotcakes as voters cast their ballots in the state election.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you could be forgiven for thinking voters have been keener on the snags than the election itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that includes the Tasmanian Premier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I did not want an election. I know Tasmanians did not want an election - but Dean Winter caused this election with his desperation and his immaturity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's poll was the second in 16 months for the state, and the fourth in seven years, called after the minority Liberal Premier Jeremy Rockliff lost a parliamentary no-confidence motion in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps keen to get it out of the way, more than 100,000 people voted early - about a quarter of Tasmania's 412,000 enrolled voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor leader Dean Winter though has maintained the Premier brought the election on himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The person who drove to Government House to call an election was Jeremy Rockliff. The person who caused this election was Jeremy Rockliff. He stubbornly refused to resign when the parliament didn't have confidence in him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential AFL stadium appears to have loomed large as an issue with voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal for the $945 million waterfront venue in Hobart has been opposed by parts of the community, the Greens, several crossbenchers - and Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I love AFL, Tasmania loves AFL, but it shouldn't come at the cost of future generations of Tasmanians. So there needs to be a pathway through that doesn't mean Macquarie Point stadium.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, both major parties have supported the idea, and some Tasmanians have also been keen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN: \"Very important. No, it'll be great for everything, the economy, the kids, the footy. Yeah, it'll be good.\"\n\n\n\nWOMAN: \"It will completely help Tasmania. We need it, our economy needs it, and it's great for the kids.\"\n\n\n\nWOMAN: \"Because we need one in Tassie.\"\n\n\n\nMAN: \"And the economic benefits.\"\n\n\n\nDISTANT VOICE: \"We need jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been other concerns too, besides the budget and cost of living pressures - from multicultural communities like the Nepalese diaspora worried about a spate of harassment and vandalism incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Santosh Adhikari is the Regional (North) Lead for the Children\u2019s University Tasmania, and the founding president of the Nepali Society of Northern Tasmania (NSNT).\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has told SBS Nepali many have wondered about the response of authorities to these incidents in such a volatile political climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely been affecting the community to grow in any place, like when the government is not stable. For example, it takes a long time to make relationships with the politicians and the policymakers. So if the government changes so frequently it is hard to build a relationship and advocate on behalf of the community to the politicians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appetite for political calm though is unlikely to be satisfied after this election.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll opinion polls before the polls opened pointed to neither the Liberals nor Labor boosting their support enough to reach the 18-seat mark required for majority government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberals held 14 seats, Labor 10, while the Greens held five and the remaining six were either independents or other parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far the Liberals have defied expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, that means the government is on track to keep all of their existing seats and perhaps pick up more while Labor could struggle to retain all of theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Labor leader has suggested they would try to govern in minority even if they finish with fewer seats than the Liberals.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those Liberal seats has been claimed by former Coalition MP Bridget Archer, who lost her federal electorate seat in the last federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Canberra, Ms Archer garnered attention for crossing the floor to vote against her own party several times - something she has already flagged she was keen on continuing in state politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to be anybody's stooge or anybody's puppet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Rockliff has also drawn a line in the sand.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has indicated he will not do any deals with the Greens to govern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We cannot risk going back to the dark old days of a Labor Green government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn official result may be weeks away because of postal votes still to arrive, but counting suggests the incumbent government's vote has risen and Labor's has collapsed.\n\n\n\n",

It's a good place to retire and what you heard from my husband, it's stress free, no time for anything, very relaxed lifestyle over there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLaleiga's husband Tupa shares the same dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The plan was to come and work, when the kids grow up, we'd retire in Tuvalu. But yeah, hopefully it's still there when we retire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family is concerned about the future prospect of returning to Tuvalu because the tiny Pacific nation is being swallowed by rising oceans due to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Australia and Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union - a landmark climate and security pact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a groundbreaking agreement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's opened a visa pathway to Australia for people like Laliega's family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am very excited. I have four sisters in Tuvalu. I'm trying got get all of them over, I just feel I would love to have a sibling, a sister, closer with me here, next to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n280 Tuvalu citizens will be granted permanent residency each year as part of the landmark pact.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust over 5,100 [[5,157]] applications have now been made - more than half of the nation's estimated population - with the lottery having closed on the 18th of July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's half of Tuvalu's population.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have speculated the entire population of the Pacific Island of Tuvalu could live in Australia within forty years if demand for a new visa lottery holds - but Pacific Minister Pat Conroy says unlike a lot of permanent resident visas, Tuvalans have a lot of freedom of movement back to Tuvalu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a world's first approach to a relationship between two countries. We're responding to a request from the Tuvaluan goverment for migration with dignity. And so we do envision that a fair number of Tuvalans will come to Australia out of a population of around 11,000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTuvalu says it's keen for its citizens to have a home to come back to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Labor approved a 50 year extension of the North West Shelf gas project which will emit 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Tuvalu's Climate Minister Maina Vakafua Talia has been among those asking the federal government to do more to curb emissions .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Opening and subsidising and exporting fossil fuels is immoral and unacceptable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Conroy says Australia remains a conscientious neighbour, mindful of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says there are also other considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSara: \"How do you explain that to Pacific leaders?\"\n\n\n\nConroy: \"Well I think that instance is an example of how we do diplomacy. We seek to partner not gag, which is not a claim every other country can make.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a not so subtle reference to China, which also offers aid, infrastructure and security partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration pathways are seen as one area where Beijing can't compete - as Ryan Edwards from the ANU Development Policy Centre says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is just a remarkably more attractive place to live. We already do have the historical ties, we've got a vibrant diaspora, a small one - but we do have that community here. It's just very different. And so it makes a lot of sense for them to use that as the avenue for strengthening realtionships and engagement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater labour mobility is something Pacific leaders have long called for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has responded with a Pacific Engagement Visa, which also offers permanent residency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm really focused on making sure those first three thousand settle visa grantees have the best possible experience of coming to Australia, and then we'll just see where the numbers go but at the moment our policy is 3,000 places a year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the transition can be difficult - as Laleiga well knows.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The problem in EVs, solar panels, batteries and other industries that supply them \u2013 and it\u2019s not a problem confined to those sectors \u2013 is that China\u2019s economic model has prioritised investment, production and jobs. Beijing has identified strategic areas of growth in its rolling five-year national economic plans and handed out massive financial subsidies to those sectors to stimulate investment. BYD, the world\u2019s biggest EV maker, slashed domestic prices by up to 34 per cent earlier this year, triggering a price war. Credit: Bloomberg Local governments, anxious to get their share of investment and jobs, then offer their own incentives and help fuel a rush by companies to do what Beijing has encouraged them to do, leading to overinvestment and overcapacity. Exports are the safety valve for the excess capacity, particularly in the post-property crisis, post-pandemic environment, where domestic demand has been weak.\n\nFaced with pushback (even before Donald Trump started slapping tariffs on everyone) from export markets concerned that China was undermining their industries and persistent deflation within its own economy \u2013 from the US to countries in Europe and Latin America \u2013 it would appear that China has finally recognised the need to act. Loading A decade ago, China had similar overcapacity issues in its steel and coal sectors. Beijing responded by forcing plant closures and corporate consolidations, while avoiding economic shock by pumping fiscal stimulus into the economy. Unlike the current overinvestment, however, those sectors were largely state-owned. It will be trickier trying to corral the multitude of private companies engaged in the crowded advanced manufacturing sectors that Beijing has identified for China\u2019s latest phase of growth. It will be even trickier in the face of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nWhile the US and China agreed to an uneasy truce after a tit-for-tat exchange of absurdly high tariffs \u2013 Trump announced a 145 per cent rate on imports from China and Beijing responded with a 125 per cent rate on imports from the US \u2013 the continuing 30 per cent US tariff on goods, once pre-existing tariffs (leftovers from the 2018-19 trade war) are taken into account, means China\u2019s exports to the US still face a 55 per cent duty. China\u2019s most recent trade numbers, for June, showed a record $US586 billion ($900 billion) surplus when they were published last week, or 5.8 per cent above the same month last year. Exports to the US, however, were 16.1 per cent lower than in June last year. It was exports to South-East Asia, Europe and Japan that accounted for the growth. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has complicated matters for Beijing. Credit: Bloomberg With Trump\u2019s deal with Vietnam, including punitive tariffs on trans-shipped exports to the US \u2013 targeting Chinese goods re-routed through third countries to exploit lower duty rates \u2013 America\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff regime poses a major threat to China\u2019s ability to continue to rely on trade for growth. Last year, Beijing tried to stimulate domestic consumption with incentives for trade-ins of autos and household appliances and other goods.\n\nThat seems to have had some effects \u2013 China\u2019s GDP grew 5.3 per cent in the June quarter, compared with the same period last year \u2013 but it\u2019s a policy whose impact will inevitably wane, as the number of remaining households with the capacity to take advantage of it dwindles. In Trump\u2019s new world trade order, there will be less global trade and less trade with China, which implies radical changes to China\u2019s economic model. There are other, more sustainable, measures that Beijing could take to boost domestic consumption, particularly increased spending on China\u2019s social welfare safety nets, but Xi has been reluctant to embark on large-scale stimulus spending or to re-balance the economy away from its over-reliance on exports. Having experiencing the implosion of China\u2019s property sector, a sector that had been used and incentivised to stimulate the wider economy during periods of economic stress, the authorities would understand that the extent of overinvestment and overcapacity in other sectors today is a threat to China\u2019s economic and social stability that could be exacerbated by a downturn in trade. The threat doesn\u2019t come from Donald Trump alone. On Friday, the G7 economies agreed to increase their collective efforts to respond to the impact of China\u2019s over-capacities and the flood of exports it is producing, along with its dominance of strategic sectors, including rare earths.",

        "text": "Pressed on specifics, Driussi was diplomatically vague: \u201cWe\u2019re exploring multiple AI applications, but competitive advantage comes from execution, not just ideas. The technology helps us analyse information and identify patterns that might otherwise be missed.\u201d What makes the Bulldogs\u2019 AI adoption particularly intriguing is Driussi\u2019s other role as CEO of Quantium, an Australian artificial intelligence and advanced analytics company. The firm works with major Australian companies, such as Woolworths, Commonwealth Bank, Telstra and Qantas. Bulldogs players are already benefiting from AI. Credit: Getty Images The connection provides the Bulldogs access to world-class AI expertise that would typically cost NRL clubs millions of dollars to develop themselves. While Driussi is careful not to discuss any formal arrangements, the potential for knowledge transfer is obvious. The \u201cFamily Club\u201d previously revealed it used AI to identify Jacob Preston during his recruitment from the Roosters\u2019 pathways system, suggesting the technology has been instrumental in some of their personnel decisions.\n\nAI\u2019s influence on sport was one of the topics discussed at the NRL\u2019s Business of Sport Conference in Las Vegas at the University of Nevada, just before this year\u2019s season-opening matches at Allegiant Stadium. The headline speakers were Driussi and Paul Devlin, the latter the global strategy leader for betting, gaming and sports technology at Amazon Web Services. Devlin, who has held high-performance roles at the Brisbane Broncos, South Sydney, Parramatta and Melbourne Storm, said AI would transform the sporting landscape. AI is being used extensively in the NFL. Credit: AP \u201cWe see AI as absolutely revolutionary, and we think it will impact every area of business in the future,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cSo everybody should be experimenting with it right now, so that was kind of the key message that came out of that NRL event ... AI is going to improve every area of business, but it is really clear on the insight generation from the data side of it in a sport like rugby league on talent identification, load monitoring, safety of the games through simulations, as well as the fan side of sport as well.\u201d\n\nSeveral NRL clubs are already dabbling with AI. One leading head coach, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the club\u2019s intellectual property, said that AI had the potential to help analysts wade through reams of data to come up with a couple of key takeaways when preparing for an opponent. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see the next step in world sport, how AI can save you time in identifying those trends so you\u2019re not wasting time doing it yourself,\u201d the coach says. \u201cThe advantage you get is saving man-hours, so you actually spend less time on computers and more with the players. \u201cYou can see the information that\u2019s relevant; missed tackles is the most outdated stat because there\u2019s no context to it. And completion rates; seven of the top-10 completing teams didn\u2019t make the finals last year.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a practical example of how AI is being used. One club found the best way to beat the Storm is to limit their time in possession. If you can restrict them to less than 23 minutes and 25 seconds with the football \u2013 they average 26 minutes and 36 seconds \u2013 you have an almost 100 per cent chance of winning. Not easy to do in reality, but it\u2019s useful information. While most NRL teams focus heavily on pre-contact metres \u2013 the distance gained before first defensive contact \u2013 to build momentum, a different focus is required to beat Canberra. AI found the Raiders were uniquely driven by post-contact metres, those tough yards gained after contact. Limit those metres, and you can stop the Green Machine. AI has already identified at least one way to try to stop the Melbourne Storm. Credit: Getty Images Canterbury\u2019s embracing of AI reflects a broader transformation sweeping through professional sport worldwide. American sports leagues are leading the charge, with the NFL processing more than 500 million data points per season through its Digital Athlete system, reducing player injuries by 700 missed games since 2023. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis and injury prevention, while the NBA uses machine learning for player load management and game strategy optimisation. English Premier League clubs are using AI for recruitment: Brighton\u2019s system identified Moises Caicedo before his eventual \u00a3115 million ($240 million) transfer from them to Chelsea, while Liverpool\u2019s partnership with Google DeepMind has produced tactical analysis tools that club experts prefer over traditional methods 90 per cent of the time.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Canterbury\u2019s AI implementation is understandable given the competitive implications; NRL clubs are notoriously protective of innovations that might provide advantages. The technological investment aligns with the Bulldogs\u2019 recent restructure.

However, the role of AI in this transformation remains largely hidden. Given the global AI sports market is tipped to grow from $1.2 billion to nearly $30 billion by 2032, getting in early could be the key to success. Already, rivals are playing catch-up to Canterbury. For a club that has endured wooden spoons and years of mediocrity, the Bulldogs are marrying old-school values with cutting-edge technology. Whether that translates to premiership glory remains to be seen, but the Bulldogs are betting heavily that the future of rugby league will be shaped by artificial intelligence.",

        "text": "But as the institution enters its fourth year of a five-year lease with little progress made, impatience is brewing in some parts of the Chinatown community over the extensive delays. So why hasn\u2019t the Museum of Chinese in Australia opened yet? History in the making Sydney\u2019s Chinatown is one of Australia\u2019s best-known and most frequented, with roots tracing back to the 1870s, when Chinese migrants shifted their fruit and vegetable trading from the Rocks to settle around Haymarket. Chinese people began arriving in Australia as part of the massive migration wave during the gold rush of the 1850s. During the 1900s, they spread into other trades and services, finding prosperity in fruit and vegetable trading, shopkeeping, tobacco farming and clothes laundering. The end of the White Australia policy in 1973 brought another wave of migrants.\n\nBut unlike Melbourne and regional cities such as Bendigo (which established its Golden Dragon Museum in 1991) and Ararat (which opened its Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre in 2001), Sydney has fallen behind in establishing its own museum to showcase the contributions of Chinese Australians. That looked to finally change in mid-2020. As the pandemic set in, Lord Mayor Clover Moore announced the council would lease the property to the Museum of Chinese in Australia. It would feature a gallery and exhibition space, programming activities, community spaces for events, an artist-in-residence program, and a cafe and shop. It is chaired by 82-year-old Daphne Lowe Kelly, who has spent most of her career serving Chinese-Australian organisations, and was presided over by Dr John Yu, a Chinese-born Australian paediatrician and 1996 Australian of the Year. But neither the council nor the museum\u2019s leadership anticipated the challenges of establishing a new gallery in a heritage-listed 19th-century building. While the site has given the museum a spiritual and physical home, with rent subsidised by the council, the lease agreement contains pages of added requirements, heritage restrictions and red tape. \u201cThis is an amazing gift,\u201d new MOCA chief executive Peter Cai said of the building. \u201cAnd it came with a lot of conditions, and some conditions are not easy to address. There are a lot of costs to remedy.\u201d\n\nThe initial renovation proposal, overseen by Tony Stephens, the previous chief executive who departed the organisation in January, came to roughly $4.7 million, said Kelly, who estimates the true cost would have been closer to $6 million or $7 million after factoring in contingencies and other unanticipated expenses. Figures from the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) show revenue from donations and bequests came to $1,766,821 in the four years between fiscal 2021 and 2024. This figure doesn\u2019t include rent subsidies from the City of Sydney\u2019s accommodation grant program, $2.28 million from Create NSW given in 2022, or two grants from the National Foundation for Australia-China Relations that exceeded $400,000. In the absence of local donations, lobbying government has been crucial. \u201cIt was almost impossible trying to raise any funds during COVID,\u201d Kelly said. \u2018People are now questioning many things\u2019\n\nA number of departures on the museum\u2019s board has added to perceptions of volatility. Only three inaugural board members remain: Kelly, Joanna Capon and Yin Cao. Dr John Yu, Stephen FitzGerald and Su-Ming Wong have departed the board. Since then, a number of others have come and gone. Loading One former director, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential matters freely, said board members had at times disagreed on the best approach to raising money. \u201cIt\u2019s become a fundraising issue. They need a certain amount of money to open. They haven\u2019t been able to achieve that yet,\u201d they said. Despite being volunteers for the charity, the former board member described the work as a \u201cfull-time job\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was very intense,\u201d they said. \u201cI found myself spending a lot of time on the wrong things. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve stepped off the board, I\u2019m still a big supporter and would love to see it open.\u201d An active representative of the Chinatown community, who declined to be named, said the museum had lost a lot of the goodwill it initially had. \u201cBecause it\u2019s been years, people are losing interest or faith,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople are now questioning many things; where has [the money] gone, how has it been spent?\u201d The same Chinatown community representative feels the museum has had little to show. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fix the building with the money you have, what are you delivering in the meantime?\u201d they asked. \u201cThey\u2019re not engaging in the community at all.\u201d Kelly is aware of the critiques. \u201cThey don\u2019t really know what goes behind the scenes, what has to be actually done, and how difficult it is to achieve a lot of what it takes to actually get it open,\u201d she said.\n\nPutting on a show Plans are now being redrawn for a \u201creduced scope\u201d refurbishment. Even then, Kelly estimates opening will cost $3 million to $4 million. \u201cThat\u2019s still a lot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember, we also need to have funds for the programs and operational costs.\u201d The race is on to pull the various pieces together for a soft launch. On top of refurbishment plans to be redrawn, costed and commenced, an exhibition director (historian and Chinese art and photography curator Shuxia Chen) has been drafted to conceptualise the museum\u2019s first exhibition, which will focus on local stories about Haymarket habitants that have been there for generations, such as the Lam family of Asian grocer Dong Nam A, or the Pang family, which ran a Chinese restaurant in Haymarket for nearly three decades and have donated large sums to the museum. \u201cWe must put on a good show for people,\u201d Cai said. Decisions need to be made about the exhibition\u2019s budget. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about special lighting, casings, you have to hire expert consultants to put it all together. It\u2019s not as easy as hanging something on a wall.\u201d Meanwhile, Kelly is hustling for donations, having visited Canberra to lobby Wong and Plibersek, and sharing bank details in community newsletters. \u201cI\u2019ve been lobbied about this so much,\u201d Wong said at the April event.\n\nThe museum has secured its tenancy for another decade, which Kelly hopes will help to encourage donations after hearing feedback that some felt reluctant to donate money for a building that belongs to the council. \u201cA refit is not as sexy to the philanthropic community,\u201d said another former board member, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe spoke to a lot of other Chinese museums around the world ... The Chinese Canadian Museum took eight years to get running from conceptualisation to open doors. It just takes a little while.\u201d Cai is excited to showcase the many contributions of Chinese Australians over the decades and is at pains to convey the \u201ccomplicated nature\u201d of the project to supporters, whom he said had been generous and full of goodwill. \u201cI can empathise with some of our supporters who just want to see the building open soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI want as much as I can to speed things up.\u201d",

        "text": "Speaking of depth, keep an eye on Hawthorn. It was exciting to see the return of Mitch Lewis against Port Adelaide, with Changkuoth Jiath, Jack Scrimshaw, Max Ramsden and Luke Breust all lining up in the VFL. Josh Weddle and Will Day are also edging closer to return, while Mabior Chol was rested with soreness. That kind of internal pressure drives standards. It\u2019s clear Sam Mitchell is still figuring out his best 22, and no one is safe. That uncertainty is keeping the Hawks hungry. Defensive identity Finals footy is brutal: contested, chaotic, and relentless. The best teams know now is the time to tighten up defensively \u2013 and test their systems under pressure. Collingwood and Adelaide are elite at restricting scores, both from stoppage and turnover. It starts up the ground \u2013 forwards and mids swarm, forcing rushed entries. Defenders win one-on-ones, set up behind the ball, and squeeze territory. It\u2019s connected, high-IQ footy. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs should be on high alert. Now sitting one game behind eighth-placed Gold Coast, they\u2019ve conceded more points than any other team in the top nine, despite boasting the league\u2019s highest-scoring attack. Their offensive firepower is clear, but it\u2019s defence that wins premierships.\n\nRight now, they\u2019re losing over half of their one-on-one contests in defensive 50, a clear sign the ball is coming in too hot and too often. That\u2019s not sustainable come finals, when games tighten up and scoring dries up. You can patch defensive issues in-season, but pressure always finds cracks. Over the next few weeks you\u2019ll see teams are also rehearsing their game modes \u2013 the tactical switches that control momentum. Think tempo shifts, kick-mark, boundary plays, skinny-side set-ups, or throwing a forward behind the ball late. It all gets tested now so that, hopefully, it will be second nature when it counts. The Bulldogs score heavily but need to tighten their defence. Credit: AFL Photos Chris Scott keeps evolving Geelong\u2019s gears. One week they have 165 marks in a slow build-up game. The next, they play direct and daring. Their ability to adjust to the opposition makes them dangerous, but the round 18 loss to GWS showed they\u2019re not quite humming yet. Expect more tinkering in the weeks ahead. The best teams know these tactical shifts must come from their on-field leaders, not coaches. That\u2019s what separates the serious contenders from the pack.\n\nDress rehearsals Much has been made of Geelong\u2019s soft run home, but is it really the advantage it\u2019s made out to be? A soft draw doesn\u2019t always prepare a team well for finals. If anything, it can rob them of the chance to become battle-hardened. The expectation is to win, and win well \u2013 and that kind of pressure can be deceptive. It might improve your ladder position, but it doesn\u2019t forge the grit needed in September. But for a team like GWS, simply trying to consolidate its position, a softer fixture is gold. Their win over Geelong in round 18 kept their season alive. Every winnable game builds momentum, and momentum builds belief. Is Geelong\u2019s soft run home really an advantage? Credit: Getty Images Friday night\u2019s clash between Brisbane and the Bulldogs was massive \u2013 and so was the finish to Collingwood\u2019s loss to Fremantle. These were finals dress rehearsals: high-pressure, contested, and played with high stakes. Games like these expose flaws and test systems. A statement win sends shockwaves \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what Fremantle and Adelaide delivered, laying down the law against fellow top-eight contenders.\n\nLoading Gold Coast did it in round 18. They brought fierce, forward-half pressure that unsettled Collingwood \u2013 and it worked. That was no fluke. They played with the intensity needed in big moments. And it told the rest of the comp: \u201cwe\u2019re not just here to compete\u201d. Still, they stumbled against Adelaide on Sunday \u2013 a reminder of just how hard it is to back up finals-like footy week in, week out. Brisbane play four of the final top eight teams in the next five weeks. Their fixture is brutal \u2013 Suns, Pies, Freo and the Hawks. It will either forge them or fry them. The same goes for the Hawks, who have Adelaide, Collingwood and the Lions. You can\u2019t simulate finals intensity on the training track. You can\u2019t smash your teammates three weeks out from finals. You need real-game exposure. If you don\u2019t get it? The first final hits like a truck.\n\nA constant fight Every game for the top nine has the power to reshape both the top four and the eight. Even Sydney, sitting 10th, are applying pressure. And don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 the ladder can hide as much as it reveals. Take Gold Coast. They\u2019ve played one fewer game, with a catch-up match still to come against the wounded Bombers. That gives them more flexibility than a glance at the ladder shows. For everyone else, it\u2019s survival mode. No luxury of load management. No room for slip-ups. The Suns have a game in hand on the rest of the contenders. Credit: AFL Photos Teams either win the games they should, or stack pressure on themselves into the next week. The Bulldogs felt that after their loss to Adelaide, and now it\u2019s compounded after falling to the Lions.\n\nHawthorn would\u2019ve felt it, too, after slipping up against Freo. They responded with a strong win over Port. Who knows, that final spot could be decided in round 24, with a cluster of mini elimination finals. At this stage of the season, every miss carries consequences. There\u2019s no room left to stumble. But there\u2019s a cost to playing high-pressure footy for five straight weeks just to scrape in. What\u2019s left in the tank when you finally get there? That\u2019s the risk. These teams aren\u2019t just fighting to simply make the finals \u2013 they\u2019re fighting to arrive in one piece. Whether their energy holds or burns out could decide their whole finals series. Crunch time\n\nLoading This is the stretch that separates the good from the great. Having been part of three premiership campaigns, I know this is when leaders matter most. Margins shrink. Stakes rise. And while there\u2019s still time to tweak and improve, the best teams are already asking: Where are the cracks, and how do we fix them? What are our strengths \u2013 and how do we harness them? Yes, luck always plays a part. But ladder position matters. Finishing high saves energy in September \u2013 home finals, the finals draw you land \u2013 these things shape your path. And they can be the difference on the final day.",
