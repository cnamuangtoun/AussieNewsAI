(AP)\n\n\"We'll give them a certain period of time to get their act together.\"\n\nThe tariffs would make Australian-made vaccines and drugs far more expensive for Americans to buy.\n\nPharmaceuticals are Australia's second biggest export to the US, behind beef.\n\nAccording to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, vaccines, antisera, toxins and cultures are worth more than $1.6 billion each year.\n\nMuch of this comes from one company, Melbourne-based CSL, which manufactures flu shots, among other pharmaceuticals.\n\nAustralia exports more than a billion dollars worth of vaccines to the US each year. (Nine Archives)\n\nInternationally, the pharmaceutical tariffs will hit Ireland and Germany the hardest.\n\nTrump's tariff threat comes as he announced a new tariff on copper.\n\nWhile Australia is a major copper exporter, very little of it goes to the United States.\n\nMost of Australia's copper exports go to Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and India.\n\n\"Our exports of copper to the US are actually quite small,\" Treasurer Jim Chalmers told ABC Radio National.\n\n\"Our pharmaceuticals industry is much more exposed to the US market, and that's why we're urgently seeking some more detail on what's been announced.\"\n\nCopper futures prices surged more than 10 per cent in the moments after Trump announced his new tariffs.\n\nTrump's so-called Liberation Day tariffs were supposed to take effect today.\n\nBut yesterday the president announced the implementation would be pushed back to August 1.\n\nChalmers decried Trump's tariff plan at a press conference yesterday.\n\n\"\ufeffWe've made it very clear that we think these tariffs are bad for the US, bad for Australia and bad for the global economy,\" he said.\n\nWall Street ended the day mixed, with the S&P 500 dropping slightly the day after a massive drop.\n\nWhat do we sell to America?\n\nAustralia's exports are largely raw materials, measured by the tonne.\n\nBut the US is selling finished products, where single items cost thousands of dollars.\n\nThe most valuable Australian export is beef, either frozen or fresh.\n\nBeef is Australia's top export to the US. (Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images)\n\nAustralia sold about $2.7 billion worth of beef to the US in 2023, much of it going to McDonald's.\n\nLamb and goat accounted for another $1.4 billion. \ufeff\n\nAustralia's second most valuable export to the US is vaccines and other pharmaceuticals.\n\nRaw metals like aluminium, gold, nickel, lead and zinc are also big exports to the US.\n\nShould Australia impose retaliatory tariffs on the US?

(Instagram/@thehobsonstores)\n\n\"Quite a few people within the community have written to him and voiced their disapproval,\" Watson told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"Unfortunately, he just doesn't care.\"\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nWatson \ufeffbought the business from the previous tenant back in 2007 and transformed Hobson's from an Italian restaurant into a bar and live music venue.\n\n\ufeffHis original lease ran until 2010 but he was offered three five-year extensions, which he used to extend the lease until October 2025.\n\nIn that time, he and late daughter Jessica, who was the pub's manager, have served almost every member of the Sandringham community.\n\nSo Watson was devastated when Enright informed him that there would be no option to extend the lease for another five years.\ufeff\n\nAndrew Watson with his daughter Jessica, who was the manager at Hobson's pub. (Instagram/@thehobsonstores)\n\nIt means he has to find a new venue to operate out of by October, or lose the business entirely.\ufeff\n\n\"I'd walk away with nothing, basically, other than just selling the assets we own,\" Watson said.\n\n\"We're trying to find somewhere where we could maybe transpose everything that we have into another building [but] it's looking very, very shaky.\"\n\nMoving into a new venue would be a costly endeavour, one Watson isn't sure he can afford.\n\nIt would also mean leaving behind priceless memories with daughter Jessica, who died in 2023, and his wife, who passed in 2024.\ufeff\n\nWatson has spent months trying to convince Enright to extend the lease so he can keep the pub going.\n\nHe started a Save Our Pub campaign and publicised Enright's personal email address, encouraging patrons and Sandringham locals to email him about the campaign.\n\n\"The building is not just a building, it's a sense of community,\" Watson said.\n\nThis letter was posted outside Hobson's and included the personal email address of the landlord. (Instagram/@strahany)\n\nAlmost 13,000km away, Enright has spent the last few months fending off angry emails from total strangers.\n\n\"People are trying to shame me and bully me into allowing him to have what he wants,\" he told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"But people have leases in businesses all the time, and leases end.\"\ufeff\n\nBorn and raised in Melbourne\ufeff, Enright helped his mother buy the Hobson's building in 1998 and became sole proprietor when she died in 2011.\n\nBy then, he was living in Palm Springs, California and was more than happy to let the existing tenant \u2013 Watson \u2013 carry on business as usual for a while.\n\nBut he had always dreamed of running his own business in the building.\ufeff\n\n\"I started talking to my wife about it and we decided that when the lease ran out, our kids would be off to college, the timing would be really good,\" Enright said\n\nHe told Watson about these plans around 2017, at which point the relationship soured.\n\nREAD MORE: Childcare giant G8 Education to put CCTV in all centres after horror sexual abuse charges\n\nDaniel Enright described himself as a family man who just wants to start his own business. (Supplied)\n\nEnright said that he is conscious of Watson's personal connection to the building and the pub's contribution to the local community over the years, but he has his own dream for the building \u2013 one that may be more lucrative.\n\nWatson acknowledged business had been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and that he had been on a fixed rent for several years.\n\nEnright alleged that the fixed rent agreement has cost him up to $400,000 in potential profit over the years.\n\n\"The business struggles. He [Watson] struggles to pay rent,\" Enright claimed.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be some white knight or anything, but I literally chose to give my tenant a better deal ... because I wanted it to work for him.\"\n\nBut with the lease coming to an end, Enright is ready to take over the building and turn it into something new for himself and Sandringham.\ufeff\n\nLooking for an extra buck? These are Australia's top side hustles View Gallery\n\nWatson is still hopeful that he can change Enright's mind about extending the lease and his Change.org petition has attracted more than 750 signatures.\ufeff\n\nBut with every day that passes, his hope wanes.\n\nSoon he fears his only option will be to find a new venue for the business he spent the better part of two decades building.\n\n\ufeff\"There might be someone out there that owns a building and wouldn't mind taking it on,\" he said hopefully.",

The program allows airline passengers to get through the screening process without removing shoes, belts or light jackets, and without having to take their laptops and bagged toiletries out.\n\nThe TSA began in 2001 when President George W. Bush signed legislation for its creation two months after the 9/11 attacks. The agency included federal airport screeners that replaced the private companies airlines had used to handle security.\n\nMan passes though Transportation Security Administration TSA security checkpoint at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. (iStock)\n\nOver the years the TSA has continued to look for ways to enhance its security measures, including testing facial recognition technology and implementing Real ID requirements.\n\nOne of the most prominent friction points for travellers is the TSA at screening checkpoints. President Donald Trump's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy asked the public in an April social media post what would make travel more seamless.\n\nThe following day, Duffy posted on X that, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that TSA is the #1 travel complaint. That falls under the Department of Homeland Security. I\u2019ll discuss this with @Sec_Noem.\u201d\n\nTrump fired TSA Administrator David Pekoske in January in the middle of a second five-year term, though he was appointed by Trump during his first term in the White House.

        "text": "Carlton coach Michael Voss has delivered a powerful response to a threat aimed at him amid the club's poor form.\n\nA threatening text message directed at Voss was left on the MCG's anti-social hotline service during the team's loss to Collingwood on Friday, and is currently being investigated by the AFL's integrity unit.\n\nVoss admitted he was initially dismissive of the threat, but then delivered a take-down of frustrated fans who have responded to the club's current slump with anger.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"We think by showing passion is about anger \u2014 and it's not about that at all,\" he said at a press conference on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"There's a way we need to behave and there's a way we need to go about it \u2014 and when things are tough, you've got to show that support the right way. Not the wrong way.\n\n\"Now, if that's a measure for some people on what it should look like, then I'm sorry you don't belong here.\n\n\"We'll move on and we'll make sure we continue to bring a supporter base that will support in the good times and it will support in the bad, and we'll continue to support our people to be able to do that.\"\n\nA recent form slump has seen Voss's Carlton side slip right out of finals contention. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nVoss said while he was \"dismissive at first\", he quickly thought about the impact such a threat would have on his loved ones.\n\n\"The first thing you always think about is the person beside you, or the family member, or the team. Because, as a result of what I do, you appreciate there's an element of scrutiny that comes with that,\" he said.\n\n\"But then there's a part that's completely unacceptable \u2014 and I think we can all agree that part is unacceptable. And we don't tolerate that as an industry.\n\n\"We leave that with the AFL Integrity (Unit) at the moment, and I expect a pretty forthright response. But this is the current nature we need to consider within the AFL environment, and we all have responsibilities \u2026 and you've got to understand that the ripple effect goes beyond what your opinion is. It reaches deeper.\"\n\nBrisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan described the threats aimed at Voss as an unfortunate constant of the AFL's coaching caper.\n\n\"We've all been through that,\" he said.\n\n\"It's tough. I see there was some death threats \u2026 that's pretty average.\n\n\"I've got no doubt he'd be doing the best job that he can, but that's just the world AFL coaches live in.\n\n\"Faceless people, lack of courage. As coaches, we try to brush those things off, to be honest.\"",

        "text": "In the past decade, just 15 sea burial permits have been granted in Australia for people who wished to find their final resting place in the deep blue ocean.\n\nIn some states, such as Tasmania, no sea burial permits have been granted since electronic records started in 1997.\n\nTravis Hamilton recently took on the \"huge\" challenge of fulfilling his dad Alan's burial wishes.\n\nMr Hamilton said his father was a visionary with an unconventional approach to life, who held a lifelong wish to be interred at sea.\n\nAlan Hamilton's lifelong wish for burial at sea was fulfilled by his son Travis. (Supplied: Travis Hamilton)\n\nAlan's send-off in April, 120 kilometres off the coast of Portland in Victoria, fulfilled that wish.\n\nHe was the first Victorian in a decade to be buried at sea.\n\nA last wish fulfilled at sea\n\nIt took 4.5 hours by boat to reach what became Alan's final resting place in the Southern Ocean.\n\nAs the sun rose that morning, his body, wrapped in a natural shroud, was secured to a specially made wooden platform on a boat.\n\nAlan Hamilton's body was wrapped in a natural shroud for his burial. (Supplied: Travis Hamilton)\n\nA small group of family was there for the final farewell, supported by funeral staff and the boat's crew.\n\nThey faced challenging 3-metre swells to reach the chosen location.\n\nBut when they arrived, it was \"eerily calm\" and the \"perfect\" patch of blue.\n\nAlan's shrouded and weighted body quickly disappeared after being released into the sea.\n\nA biodegradable wreath and letters from family and friends were thrown into the ocean afterwards, and the boat traced a circle of honour around the burial site.\n\nFlowers and personal letters were left at the location of Alan Hamilton's burial. (Supplied: Travis Hamilton)\n\nMr Hamilton said dolphins broke the surface of the water near the vessel soon after they departed.\n\n\"It was spectacular, it was beautiful; I'd say it was joyous,\" Mr Hamilton told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\n\" Of course there was grief \u2014 it was really sad finally putting that body to rest, but it's something I'll never forget. \"\n\nMr Hamilton began researching sea burials when his father shared his desire for one in about 2020.\n\nHe quickly realised how many challenges he'd have to overcome to achieve it.\n\n\"When I told dad all of these challenges \u2026 he just smiled and said, 'Well, that's what I want,'\" Mr Hamilton said.\n\nAlan Hamilton, pictured in 2016. (Supplied: Travis Hamilton)\n\nWhat is required for sea burial?\n\nA state and federal permit was required for Alan's sea burial, which had to be done at a location with a depth of no less than 3,000 metres.\n\nTo reach a patch of water of that depth, his body had to be transported beyond Australia's continental shelf.\n\nA chartered boat made the journey, requiring a captain willing to participate who then needed permits for the boat to travel the required distance and additional safety gear onboard.\n\nPortland is the closest port to the continental shelf in Victoria, and so became the location for departure.\n\nThis required collaboration with a local funeral home to ensure Alan's body could be kept in a climate-controlled environment following transit from metropolitan Melbourne.\n\nDaybreak at the marina in Portland before Alan Hamilton's sea burial. (Supplied: Travis Hamilton)\n\nFuneral operator Simon Mumm\u00e9 said many roadblocks and logistical challenges were overcome to ensure the burial could happen.\n\n\"Every single decision I needed to solve, there was a 'no' \u2026 or there was no information on how to solve it,\" Mr Mumm\u00e9 said.\n\nHe advised others organising a sea burial to start planning as early as possible, allowing time to overcome the many obstacles that must be faced.\n\nBurial at sea a tradition shrouded in mystery Photo shows Burial at sea is a tradition filled event Once a tradition set aside for sailors from days of yore, the process of burial at sea has not completely disappeared.\n\nEmbalming of the body, as is typically done, is prohibited for a sea burial.\n\nMr Mumm\u00e9 said Alan's body could only be bathed and washed, then was kept in a climate-controlled environment to slow nature's processes.\n\nThe shroud had to be biodegradable and weighted, Mr Mumm\u00e9 opted for iron weights over lead to reduce the environmental impact.\n\nCrucially, written consent from the deceased is needed.\n\nA formal letter or information in a will expressing the desire for a sea burial is essential.\n\nSimon Mumm\u00e9 of Candour Funerals. (Supplied: Candour Funerals)\n\nMr Mumm\u00e9 said he was advised that online information stating the deceased must have a strong connection to the sea was not true or current.\n\n\"Anybody can apply for the permit, as long as it's a written wish in their will or a formal letter,\" he said.\n\nAlan did not have a strong connection to the sea, but liked to fish occasionally.\n\nSea burial alternatives\n\nA sea burial can cost upwards of $35,000 and the date must be flexible to allow for poor weather.\n\nIf the cost or need for flexibility is prohibitive, there are alternatives that provide a connection to the sea.\n\nFuneral director Kimba Griffith once worked with clients attempting to fulfil a friend's wish for a sea burial, but ultimately advised them to choose a different option.\n\nKimba Griffith (right) with The Last Hurrah Funerals co-founding partner Nastassia Jones. (Supplied: Wild Rose Pictures)\n\n\"We found a charter company who would do it and we also found a funeral director in Warrnambool who would assist,\" she said.\n\n\" It was going to be extremely expensive and almost impossible to do from [Melbourne], so in the end we did something else. \"\n\nDo you have a plan for when you die? Photo shows Older style concrete graves with large headstones and iron fencing set in an area with lawn. Death literacy advocates are seeing a shift in how death and dying is perceived in the community.\n\nFor alternative memorials or burials, Ms Griffith suggested returning a person's ashes to the water using a biodegradable urn, made from sand and vegetable matter.\n\nA coastal drive-by in a hearse, during which family and friends gather to toast the person, is another idea.\n\nA paddle out, where ashes are scattered by a group on surfboards or a vessel, is another popular choice.\n\n\"There are so many ways you can think about fulfilling someone's wishes,\" Ms Griffith said.\n\nNo permit for scattering ashes at sea\n\nLady Nelson tall ship master Astrid Wilson likes the simple but meaningful gesture of scattering ashes at sea.\n\nMs Wilson has attended many memorials in a professional and personal capacity, where ashes were scattered from a boat or ship.\n\nNo permit is required to scatter ashes in the ocean or water in Australia.\n\nMs Wilson advised caution when scattering ashes, to ensure they did not blow back on participants.\n\nAshes did blow back during an emotional memorial she once attended on a large ferry.\n\nMs Wilson said she believed the person being remembered would have seen the humour in it.\n\nTall ship master Astrid Wilson has attended many memorials at sea. (Supplied: Astrid Wilson)\n\n\"It was for a chick who worked on Bass Strait her whole life \u2014 she was quite young \u2014 and cancer took her,\" she said.\n\n\"She just wanted to go back to where she felt her happiest, which was at work on a ship on Bass Strait.\n\n\"It was so special \u2026 she [her ashes] did swirl around and end up on the boat, but it was really good because it was just part of her.\"\n\nMr Hamilton said he felt a huge sense of relief in being able to fulfil his dad Alan's final wish for a sea burial.\n\nThrough his father's burial, and his own journey working in the funeral industry, he said he had learnt the importance of ritual.\n\n\"Even if someone is cremated, the act of going out and having some sort of ceremony is really important,\" Mr Hamilton said.",

(ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nPBS pain point for US big pharma\n\nThe Trump administration had been urged by America's powerful pharmaceutical lobby to slap tariffs on Australian pharmaceuticals in retaliation for its Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which requires drug companies to negotiate prices with the government in order for customers to receive a subsidy for their medicines.\n\nIn March, industry lobbying body PhRMA labelled PBS subsidies an \"egregious and discriminatory\" trade instrument.\n\nThe federal government has flatly ruled out negotiating away the scheme that underpins cheaper medicines for millions of Australians.\n\n\"Our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not something we are willing to trade away or do deals on,\" Mr Chalmers said.\n\n\" We'll work through it in a methodical way, but we make it clear once again \u2026 that the PBS is not on the table. \"\n\nProductivity Commission urges Australia to ditch tariffs Photo shows An older man wearing a red tie, white shirt and a black suit jacket with a serious expression The federal government's economic think tank says Australia will likely be a winner from Donald Trump's tariffs if it does not retaliate and that we would be better off by removing more of the nation's remaining tariffs.\n\nA Productivity Commission report released this week concluded that Mr Trump's first round of tariffs, which hit Australian steel and aluminium, could actually be \"good\" for the Australian economy, with global trade reshaping around growing US protectionism.\n\nIt concluded Mr Trump's \"liberation day\" tariffs could provide a 0.37 per cent boost to Gross Domestic Product.\n\nHowever, the tariffs on steel and aluminium will sit at a much smaller rate of 10 per cent, and the share of Australian steel and aluminium exports that go to the US is much smaller than pharmaceuticals.\n\nAbout 40 per cent of Australia's pharmaceutical exports are to the United States.",

        "text": "Former RBA Assistant Governor (Economic) Luci Ellis now works as the chief economist for the Westpac group.\n\nHer thoughts on the central bank's decision to hold rates have an insider's eye. Check out Luci Ellis's latest note, just released:\n\n\"In a decision split 6 in favour, 3 against, the RBA Board decided to wait before cutting rates. It wasn\u2019t a shoo-in to cut, and in the end, the RBA chose caution over decisiveness.\"\n\nThe decision defied widespread predictions.\n\n\"The post-meeting statement noted the gradual recovery in private sector demand and a tight labour market as justification for the decision. It also said that the Board judged that it could wait for a \u201clittle more information\u201d, which the Governor subsequently clarified included the quarterly CPI and another labour force release. \"\n\nIn the press conference, Michele Bullock also discussed how the monthly CPI reading \u2014 which was only started in recent years \u2014 isn't as substantial as the long-running quarterly one.\n\n\"In its May minutes, the Board had expressed a preference to be \u201ccautious and predictable\u201d in its conduct of monetary policy. Today it erred on the side of the former. The general tone of today\u2019s post-meeting statement was of a central bank that has not been updating its view of the economy that quickly.\"\n\nEllis notes what Governor Bullock emphasised, that the hold was a \"question of timing, not direction\". A majority of Board members simply opted to wait for more information, principally the quarter 2 CPI release.\n\n\"We read the tone of the media conference as flagging that the rate cut is still on for August, provided the trimmed mean inflation rate for June quarter does not surprise too much on the upside. Accordingly, we reinstate the likely timing of the next cut to August, though there is a small chance even this is delayed. We also retain the spread-out timing (November, February, May) of subsequent cuts as being in line with the cautious approach the RBA has flagged.\"\n\nCutting this month was not the \"shoo-in\" that markets expected, she says.\n\n\"The RBA has been a reluctant rate-cutter in recent months, especially earlier in the year. Still, the decision to hold is surprising, and the 6\u20133 split vote shows how finely balanced the decision was. Given the lack of consensus on the Board, the low information content of the post-meeting statement was not that surprising; this was the text a split Board could agree upon.\"\n\nHow did people vote?\n\nHere's some sport, Luci Ellis is juggling who she thinks voted what way:\n\n\"While votes are unattributed, we think it is unlikely that the external Board members all voted to hold while the Governor, Deputy Governor and new Treasury Secretary all voted to cut. It is more likely that the Governor, Deputy and some external Board members aligned to a staff recommendation to hold, but not all the external members were convinced to wait.\"\n\nSo her tip is the RBA staff wanted to hold, and convinced a few more to join them.\n\nAnd expect more shocks, with the new structure meaning they'll not be jaw-boning where they are going.\n\n\"The main other lesson from today\u2019s decision is the step change it implies for the RBA\u2019s approach to communication. With the Monetary Policy Board more explicitly central to the decision-making process (in form only \u2013 they always were central in substance), the RBA Governor will be unwilling to push back on market pricing in between meetings because they will want to avoid pre-judging what the Board decides, or prejudicing the deliberations, at the next meeting. This means that episodes of the RBA surprising market pricing, as it has done today, will be more common. This is one of the downsides of the RBA Review recommendations. Not only are there fewer inter-meeting speeches by the senior officials now that there is a press conference instead, but those opportunities might also not be used to steer market pricing.\"\n\nMaybe not even August?\n\nIn what would be a publicly unpopular move, Luci Ellis suggests the RBA may not cut at the next meeting:",

Then came a random \"fault\" call.\n\nChair umpire Louise Azemar-Engzell stopped play and a few moments later announced: \"Ladies and gentlemen, we will replay the last point due to a malfunction.\"\n\nPavlyuchenkova fumes after Wimbledon's 'deactivated' electronic line system misses call Photo shows A disgruntled Russian tennis player stands on court with hands on her hips after a point at Wimbledon. Wimbledon's move to electronic line calls has raised the ire of Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova after the Russian lost a key point because the system was 'deactivated'.\n\nThe system had tracked Fritz's shot in the rally as if it was a serve, the All England Club said.\n\n\"The player's service motion began while the (ball boy/ball girl) was still crossing the net and therefore the system didn't recognise the start of the point. As such the chair umpire instructed the point be replayed,\" the club said in a statement.\n\nAfter the \"fault\" call, a perplexed Fritz turned to the umpire's chair and spread his hands as if asking: \"What was that?\"\n\nNeither player seemed upset and Khachanov won the replayed point, but the fifth-seeded Fritz advanced to the semifinals with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory.\n\n\"If it would happen on a break point or deuce or maybe tiebreaker, OK, you can get more mad,\" the 17th-seeded Khachanov said.\n\n\"But it was just beginning of the set, 15-love or love-15. I don't remember. It was maybe not that important moment. That's why I stayed really focused and calm.\"\n\nWimbledon switched this year to the electronic system from human line judges but it has been anything but smooth.\n\nOn Sunday, there was a glaring mistake at Centre Court during Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's three-set victory over Sonay Kartal in the fourth round.\n\nA shot by Kartal clearly landed past the baseline but was not called out by the automated set-up \u2014 called Hawk-Eye \u2014 because it had been shut off.\n\nOn Monday, club officials blamed \"human error\" for the oversight.\n\nClub chief executive Sally Bolton said the technology was \"inadvertently deactivated\" by someone for three points in the match.\n\nFritz, who will face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz for a spot in the final, says he still prefers the new system.\n\n\"There's going to be some issues here and there but, to be honest, I still think it's much better to just have the electronic line-calling [system] calling the lines as opposed to umpires,\" he said.\n\n\"I do like not having to think about challenging calls in the middle of points,\" Fritz continued.\n\n\"I do like that we don't have to argue about calls and all this stuff. I think it's a better system.\"\n\nAlcaraz sets up semifinal meeting with Fritz\n\nDefending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz has eased into the semifinals, where he will face the fifth-seeded Fritz.\n\nAlcaraz brushed aside the remaining home player, Briton Cameron Norrie, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3.\n\nThe Spaniard lost the first three points on serve, but prevented Norrie from securing the break and never looked back. He took the first set in 28 minutes and the match in 99.\n\nThe victory extended his winning streak to 23 matches and his record on grass to 34 wins from 37.\n\n\"To be able to play another semifinal here at Wimbledon is really special,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"I am really happy with the level I played today against a really difficult player like Cam.\"\n\nAP/AAP",

        "text": "The US has substantial reserves and resources of unmined copper, but only produced about half the 1.64 million tonnes of copper that it consumed last year. It gained another 150,000 or so tonnes from recycling but imported 810,000 tonnes of the refined metal. The challenge for the US is that it has copper in the ground but its smelting and refining capacity has shrunk over the past several decades. A slump in the copper price in the 1980s and 1990s led to the closure of US mines and smelters. In the late 1990s it still had 11 smelters in operation; today it has two, with a third that processes scrap. By contrast, China, which saw a strategic opportunity in the 1990s, made major investments in smelting and now has more than half the world\u2019s smelting capacity. Ore from the rest of the world is exported to China to be smelted and refined and then either increasingly consumed within China \u2013 which is leading the global electrification race \u2013 or re-exported. Given the centrality of copper to the 21st Century economy and advanced industrial and military technologies, China\u2019s dominance of the sector is obviously seen by the US as a national security threat.\n\nThe obvious response would be to produce and process more of its own copper. The problem it has is that most of its undeveloped resources are on federal land, which creates challenging and very lengthy approval processes. The average time to bring a new US mine into operation has blown out to about 29 years. The giant Resolution copper project in Arizona owned by Rio Tinto and BHP, for instance, was discovered in 1995. The Resolution Copper mine in Arizona. Credit: Darryl Webb Rio submitted a mine plan for the project, in which the companies have already invested several billion dollars, in 2013. It took until May this year for the US Supreme Court to clear the way for a land swap, opposed by native Americans, that will enable the project to proceed. It will take a decade or more to actually bring a mine into production. (BHP and Rio, via the giant Escondida mine in Chile will, incidentally, be exposed to the copper tariff, although more of that project\u2019s output is exported to Asia. Rio does have a mine \u2013 and a smelter \u2013 in the US that might benefit from the tariff and the higher domestic copper prices it will produce).\n\nAdding more domestic supply of copper might address the threat of supply shortages and the increasing reliance on Latin America (although the US has a free trade agreements with Chile, the major producer), but it doesn\u2019t solve the shortage of processing capacity. Loading Smelters take at least a decade and $US3 billion-plus of investment to construct and involve environmentally unfriendly processes, which is part of the explanation for why much of the global capacity migrated to China which, at the time, was more interested in economic and strategic benefits than its environment. Even if that capacity could be built in the US, it is unlikely to be competitive with China\u2019s smelters. China already has about 8 of the 20 largest copper smelters in the world. In the meantime, with the likelihood that Trump\u2019s new tariff will apply not only to imports of refined copper but downstream semi-fabricated products like copper sheeting and wire, US manufacturers reliant on copper will face a steep increase in costs.\n\nAmerica\u2019s reliance on imported copper, once the tariff is in place, means that those manufacturers will not only incur higher costs that they will try to pass onto their own customers, but those costs will be unique to the US and therefore they will, to the extent that they compete outside the US or with imports, be at a significant competitive disadvantage. The ubiquity of copper usage means that will be an economy-wide issue, adding to inflation while damaging US competitiveness. That\u2019s a familiar aspect of Trump\u2019s trade war on the rest of the world. US copper buyers have already seen a preview of what\u2019s to come within the differential in US copper prices and those in the rest of the world as traders scrambled to get in ahead of the tariffs. That rush to get their hands on physical metal not only forced the copper price to record levels, but has inverted the normal futures price curve for copper, known as contango, where future prices are higher than the spot price to reflect the costs of storage, opportunity costs and risk. The price curve is now in \u201cbackwardation\u201d \u2013 spot prices are higher than future prices, with the prospect of losses for traders and hedged sellers of copper as their contracts expire and they are forced to cover their exposures at higher prices.",

        "text": "The tactical identity is clear \u2013 and will become clearer We know what Montemurro is trying to do: introduce an attacking, possession-based style of play into a team that has lacked on-field direction for some time. And when they last had a tactical direction, which feels like a lifetime ago, it wasn\u2019t this one, with Tony Gustavsson\u2019s preference to play a more transitional game. There were times when we saw it come to life, times when it broke down, and times when it didn\u2019t look like there was a plan at all. That\u2019s natural, given the circumstances: players are at the end of their seasons, many have had to be managed carefully, and chemistry can\u2019t just be built overnight when you\u2019re throwing together an unfamiliar team under a new coach who says he only knows one way of working. Behind the Matildas: Leanne Hall, Emanuele Chiappero, Joe Palatsides, head coach Joe Montemurro, Tony Franken and Emily Husband. Credit: Getty Images Fortunately, it\u2019s unlikely to get worse. The players to come in are more technically adept at executing Montemurro\u2019s plan, though being able to limit turnovers and stroke the ball around for long periods has proven a challenge for many of them in the past. And the ones who had a taste of it in this window can go away and work on what they know they\u2019ll be asked to do next time they\u2019re called in.\n\nThe midfield remains a puzzle Most people thought Paris 2024 would be Gorry\u2019s last tournament. Now she\u2019s about to turn 33 but she\u2019s still kicking around. But does she come straight back into this team when she\u2019s fit again? Should she, given the progress made by Wheeler (a late withdrawal from this window) and Cooney-Cross as a tandem midfield pairing? And where does Emily van Egmond fit into the picture, if anywhere? Matildas veteran Katrina Gorry. Credit: Visionhaus via Getty Images Montemurro rifled through a bunch of different combinations in this window \u2013 including the use of Kennedy as a defensive midfielder, which is where she plays for Angel City FC \u2013 to try and figure out how many viable options he may have to work with in future. Going back to the likes of Alex Chidiac and Chloe Berryhill didn\u2019t go too well, and opinion is split as ever on van Egmond. If the Asian Cup was tomorrow, the make-up of the midfield would be anyone\u2019s guess right now. Montemurro really needs to get some flying hours into the ones he deems to be first-choice to help them build up as much synergy as they can, as quickly as they can.\n\nAmy Sayer has finally arrived Sayer was 16 years old when made her international debut at the 2018 Tournament of Nations \u2013 in the same window as Fowler, who was 15. But as Fowler\u2019s career exploded in the ensuing years, Sayer chose to take the US college route, and became a bit out of sight, out of mind. An ACL injury amplified that. She came close, but Gustavsson never picked her in the squad for a major tournament. Amy Sayer and Joe Montemurro. Credit: Getty Images Now 23, Sayer has come on in leaps and bounds. She has been arguably the \u201cfind\u201d of the last few months, stealing the spotlight in Tom Sermanni\u2019s final games in charge and then keeping that momentum rolling under Montemurro. Best used as a No.10, she can also play out wide in attack, and her poise and vision are, if not Fowler-esque, then of the same genre. She can be a huge player for the Matildas for many years to come.\n\nThe Matildas have depth in defence For once! The emergence of Jamilla Rankin and the development of Courtney Nevin and Charli Grant mean that Montemurro will have the incredible luxury of using Catley as a centre-back. Matildas defender Jamilla Rankin (right) in action against Panama. Credit: Getty Images And with Clare Hunt kicking on and Heatley making big strikes, there\u2019s now red-hot competition for who should partner her \u2013 as well as, in the case of Kennedy, the possibility of more time anchoring the midfield rather than the back four. Factor in Carpenter on the other side, who will no doubt be rejuvenated by her move to Chelsea, and the Matildas suddenly have what they\u2019ve not really had in a number of years: true depth in defence.\n\nThere\u2019s no room for sentiment in selection anymore We mentioned van Egmond and Gorry before. What about Tameka Yallop? Or Emily Gielnik? For every player like Hayley Raso or Michelle Heyman who can demonstrate their unarguable worth to the team, there\u2019s a fellow veteran who might be coasting along on reputation rather than currency. The idea of peak van Egmond, for example, is compelling. But how often do we see that idea in a match? Same goes for Chidiac. And while some of these established players are vital for dressing room morale, or in the case of Yallop and Gielnik are incredibly versatile, at what point do they risk being overtaken by emerging talents who can offer as much, if not more? Are we there yet? Possibly. Emily van Egmond. Credit: Getty Images These are the sort of questions Montemurro needs to consider carefully. If he can\u2019t see a future for a player at Matildas level, and can\u2019t be sure that someone else couldn\u2019t do their job better at the Asian Cup, then he needs to tap them on the shoulder, because every minute matters right now.",

        "text": "Sophie alleged that Wallace had groped her while she was standing at a bar with him and his co-host, John Torode, at the 2013 series wrap party, doing it \u201ccovertly\u201d so that Torode did not notice. She did not complain at the time because she feared being \u201cbooted off\u201d the MasterChef team. Another MasterChef crew member, known as Alice, alleged that Wallace invited her into his dressing room in 2012, saying that he needed help getting changed into black tie, then pushed her down onto a sofa and pulled his trousers down. She reported the \u201cdisgusting and predatory\u201d behaviour to the independent production company which made the show, but was allegedly told by a senior member of the production team: \u201cYou\u2019re over 16, you\u2019re not being \u2018Jimmy Saviled\u2019.\u201d Allegations spanning decades\n\nThe allegations date back to 2002, when a participant on the BBC\u2019s Saturday Kitchen \u2013 which was at the time produced in-house by the BBC\u2013 said that Wallace put a hand on her groin during a pre-show dinner and asked: \u201cDo you like that?\u201d Gregg Wallace (right) with MasterChef co-host, Australian-born John Torode. Credit: The Telegraph\u2019s investigation heard from a junior production worker on the show who alleged that Wallace groped her breasts and bottom, but she dared not speak out for fear of losing her job. She said that Wallace\u2019s conduct appeared to be condoned by senior members of staff who worked on the program. \u201cIt was like no one else had a problem with what was happening, so I couldn\u2019t have a problem either,\u201d she said. While MasterChef in the UK is made by Banijay, an independent production company, it is on the BBC\u2019s list of eight \u201cflagship programmes\u201d which have special status owing to the length of time they have been established and how popular they are with audiences \u2013 raising questions of why there was no oversight from BBC management.\n\nThe new allegations about Wallace and the findings of the review will pile fresh pressure on Davie, the BBC director-general, who is already facing criticism over his handling of Bob Vylan\u2019s controversial set at Glastonbury. The BBC is also braced for a highly critical report into its decision to broadcast a Gaza documentary without sufficient checks to establish that the child narrator was the son of a Hamas minister. Wallace stepped back from MasterChef in November after a number of allegations came to light. He had co-presented the show since 2005. In a statement ahead of the report\u2019s publication, and anticipating the BBC\u2019s new allegations, Wallace said: \u201cAfter 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others.\u201d He claimed that the report will clear him of serious wrongdoing but will find him \u201cprimarily guilty of inappropriate language\u201d.\n\n\u201cI recognise that some of my humour and language, at times, was inappropriate. For that, I apologise without reservation,\u201d he said. Loading He previously admitted to opening his dressing room door and shouting \u201chooray\u201d while naked except for a sock on his penis, but said this was after the day\u2019s filming had finished. Wallace hits back at BBC He hit out at the BBC News allegations, saying: \u201cThe BBC is no longer providing balanced and impartial public service journalism. It is peddling baseless and sensationalised gossip masquerading as properly corroborated stories.\n\n\u201cThe BBC is choosing to allow BBC News to run with this uncorroborated tittle-tattle in an attempt to \u2018get ahead\u2019 of the Silkin summary report and derail what has been an extremely thorough process. \u201cThis feels to me like BBC News is chasing slanderous clickbait rather than delivering impartial journalism.\u201d The 60-year-old presenter complained that his suspected autism had made the MasterChef studio \u201ca dangerous environment\u201d for him. He added: \u201cI was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all. For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.\u201d Kirsty Wark, the former Newsnight presenter, claimed that Wallace had told \u201csexualised\u201d jokes while she was a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef in 2011.\n\nWallace hit back by saying that the complaints were coming from \u201ca handful of middle-class women of a certain age,\u201d a comment for which he later apologised. He said in his statement that \u201cthe most damaging claims including allegations from public figures\u2026 have not been upheld [and] were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six-month investigation.\u201d Wallace also suggested that some of his behaviour was down to autism and criticised bosses for failing to take that into account. \u201cMy neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef. \u201cYet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years. That failure is now being quietly buried,\u201d he said. Wallace suggested that others were guilty of more serious offences than him, but that their behaviour would be brushed under the carpet.",

Credit: Getty The captain\u2019s view As one of Starc\u2019s longest-serving teammates, Cummins knows better than anyone how difficult it is to play 100 Tests as a fast bowler. Cummins made his Test debut against South Africa a fortnight before Starc was given a baggy green against New Zealand in December 2011.\n\nThe NSW pair has bowled together for the best part of 15 years, and Cummins has the utmost respect for Starc\u2019s resilience. So high is Starc\u2019s standing in Cummins\u2019 eyes, that he still gets the new ball over the skipper. Australia\u2019s captain Pat Cummins talks to bowler Mitchell Starc on day three of the first cricket Test match against West Indies at Kensington Stadium in Bridgetown, Barbados. Credit: AP \u201cWe\u2019ll come up with something [to celebrate]. It\u2019s a huge effort,\u201d Cummins, who has played 55 of his 70 Tests with Starc, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty small crew that have played 100 Tests. He\u2019s the second fast bowler, which is really rare and tough to do. Proud of him. \u201cHe\u2019s still bowling 145km/h at the end [of the recent Test against the West Indies]. I can\u2019t fathom playing 100 games and keeping that kind of speed. He\u2019s a warrior, turns up every week and just cracks on. He\u2019s such a low-fuss kind of guy. All things going well, it\u2019ll be a great week for him.\u201d\n\nHazlewood: \u2018It\u2019s the late night physio sessions\u2019 Hazlewood, a year younger than Starc, is another close friend and a constant presence in Australia\u2019s attack. The pair has played 59 Tests together. Hazlewood, who debuted three years after Starc in Tests, reflected on the unseen side of Starc\u2019s longevity \u2013 the mental and physical toll fast bowling takes on the body. \u201cOne of the things I admire is the work ethic,\u201d Hazlewood said. \u201cEveryone just sees you play the games and don\u2019t see much else. Being in his shoes as well, and being around it for so long, you see everything that goes into it. It\u2019s the late night physio treatment sessions. Josh Hazlewood of Australia celebrates a wicket with Mitchell Starc in January 2024. Credit: Getty \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing achievement to play 100 Tests. It\u2019ll be awesome to be part of it.\u201d\n\nAsked if there was a spell or match that he vividly remembers Starc being at the peak of his powers, Hazlewood said: \u201cI think you see snippets of it nearly every game. You know when he\u2019s in your team, wickets can fall in a heap, whether it be up front, in the middle or the tail. If he gets the ball in hand and gets on a roll, he can go bang, bang, bang and turn the game on its head. No matter the conditions, no matter the opposition, no matter the situation, he can turn the game on its head in space with two overs.\u201d Lyon: Why Starc is special Lyon, Australia\u2019s most prolific off-spinner, has played in all but five of Starc\u2019s 99 Tests. He has seen it all. \u201cHow long have we got?\u201d Lyon said. \u201cI\u2019ll be over the moon. I\u2019ll probably get emotional seeing him play and go out there. I\u2019ve seen the work and the injuries he\u2019s been through. He\u2019s basically the first picked in every Australian cricket team in my life. \u201cStarcy is special. He\u2019s the ultimate professional in the way he prepares and also recovers. For him to be on the verge of 100 Test matches \u2026 and be the second fast bowler, I feel like that\u2019s a phenomenal record.\n\n\u201cThe number of times that he plays through pain or injury or soreness is phenomenal.\u201d Lyon is adamant Starc is still bowling as well as ever. This year, he\u2019s averaging 20.86 with the ball. \u201cTo be honest with you, I feel like over the last 12 months, it\u2019s probably the best that Starcy\u2019s ever bowled,\u201d Lyon said. Nathan Lyon celebrates with Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. Credit: AP\n\n\u201cThe rhythm that he bowled with in the World Test Championship final a couple of weeks ago was incredible viewing. Even when he\u2019s not at his best, he finds a way. He\u2019s just that competitor that you want to play with.\u201d A coach\u2019s love Loading McDonald opened the batting against Starc in his final first-class match in 2014. Eleven years on, Starc is a stalwart in the team he coaches and selects. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible achievement,\u201d McDonald said.",

        "text": "As Prime Minister Anthony Albanese prepares to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, questions have been raised over how the US will view the visit and whether there could be consequences for Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visit comes after US President Donald Trump announced new tariff rates of 25 per cent on some trading partners, including Japan and South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS tariffs on Australian products remain at 10 per cent, but with relations between the two allies strained, could the US respond negatively to Australia potentially strengthening ties with China?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\n\n\nAustralia's relationship with China\n\nAlbanese is set to visit China from Saturday, his second trip to the country since he became prime minister in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina is Australia's largest two-way trading partner, and buys almost a third of Australia's exports. Trade between the two countries was worth almost $312 billion in 2024, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Trump declares 25 per cent tariffs on Japan and South Korea in first wave of letters\n\nThe relationship appears to be strengthening after a period of volatility, which included China placing restrictions on some Australian exports between 2020 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has called for greater collaboration in fields such as AI, healthcare and green energy under a revised free-trade deal between the two nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the Australian Financial Review, Xiao wrote that it was \"time to advance bilateral relations with steady progress\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wrote that China was willing to review the two countries' trade agreement with \"a more open attitude and higher standard\", including further consolidating traditional areas and actively pursuing new growth areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Nedopil, director of the Griffith University Asia Institute, said while there is a \"mutual interest\" in strengthening the relationship between Australia and China, this has been years in the making.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe does not believe China is seeking to take advantage of rocky relationships between the US and its allies, including Australia.\n\n\n\n\"China has been trying to make bilateral and multilateral alliances even before Trump was in office, it's not that the stabilisation of the Australia-China relationship only came when Trump was in office,\" Nedopil said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And a number of the topics that are on the agenda are not new topics.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Treasurer Jim Chalmers was asked whether the Australian government was considering freer trade with China, Korea and Japan in response to Trump's tariffs. Trump announced on Tuesday he would impose tariffs of at least 25 per cent on South Korea and Japan from August unless the countries can strike deals with the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US imposed tariffs on China of 145 per cent earlier this year and average US tariffs on Chinese exports now stand at around 50 per cent, according to the US-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Chalmers did not directly address the issue of the US tariffs, he said stabilising Australia's relationship with China was positive for the economy, workers, employers and industries.\n\n\n\n\"A good, stable, reliable trading relationship with China is key to making sure that our economy continues to grow the right way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want good, reliable, diverse trading relationships right around the world. We've got wonderful exports, we've got huge opportunities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers said the government was \"optimistic about the future when it comes to Australia's place in the global economy\".\n\n\n\n'Political tension' between Australia and the US\n\nWhile Australia's ties with China could be building, the relationship with the US is somewhat strained, according to David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the Australian National University's National Security College.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a relationship we've had for decades and decades now, and we have consistently viewed that as our most important strategic partner and one of our closest international friends and alliances,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the same time, it's clear that we're going through a period of political tension and relational tension.\"\n\n\n\nAndrews believes much of the tension has come as a result of Trump's tariffs, which he announced in April, along with \"heavy-handedness\" of the US government.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said while the relationship is \"challenging\" at the moment, diplomacy and international relations are constantly evolving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is an ongoing, persistent rebalancing of that relationship to understand what is being asked of us and therefore how much we are willing to accept as well,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that the prime minister has been very clear that [in] putting a very public sense of boundary or limit on what we will do and how far we'll go and the implications for the relationship.\"\n\n\n\nCould the US change tariffs on Australia?\n\nAt the time of writing, Australia has not received a tariff increase, meaning most of its exports to the US remain subject to the baseline 10 per cent, while there is a 50 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government would continue to try to negotiate a total exemption from US tariffs, Albanese said, even though no country in the world had done so.\n\n\n\nAndrews said the \"status quo\" of the 10 per cent tariff is likely Australia's \"best case scenario\", and pointed out that no other trading partners had been unable to negotiate an exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, it would be great if we could get some sort of exemption on the steel and aluminium tariff, for example, but I don't see any evidence that's likely to change,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a dispositional change in the way the United States views the international economic order, and we can't convince them otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be wildly optimistic to think that we could make any, I think, improvement on our situation.\"\n\n\n\nWhile a tariff reduction or exemption may be unlikely, some have questioned whether the US government could raise tariffs on Australia in retaliation to Albanese's meeting with Xi.\n\n\n\n\n\nNedopil said it's difficult to predict the actions of the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In a way, the US policymaking at this time seems to be very news-driven and so very short-term sentiment-driven,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what President Trump might consider as disrespect can lead to a short-term decision announcement that might be more negative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between China and the US is complex, with the two considered economic and strategic competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNedopil said he believes the rivalry has become \"much more intense\" on a number of fronts, which he says is \"undermining US dominance\", which Trump may take into consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think the other shift that has taken place ... is that actually a lot of Asian countries and emerging economies are not viewing China as negatively as they used to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there are dynamics that make the US seem not as strong and potentially [not] feel as strong and therefore also trying to hold onto power with a number of different means.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

We've got real wages growing. Unemployment is low. Our economy has continued to tick over. Interest rates have come down twice in five months, but we know the job's not finished because people are still under pressure and the global environment is so uncertain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Territory Police have acknowledged systemic racism within their organisation and have promised to stamp out bigotry and reform policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after the end of the three year coronial inquiry into the fatal police shooting of 19-year-old First Nations man Kumanjayi Walker.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoroner Elizabeth Armitage's report found Mr Walker's death was avoidable, and that the state's police force failed to protect the public through poor supervision and management of constable Zachary Rolfe's use of force.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her statement she says she also found that \"Mr Rolfe was racist and that he worked in and was the beneficiary of an organisation with hallmarks of institutional racism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNT Police Deputy Commissioner Martin Dole says they have acknowledged the coroner's 18 recommendations to police and will act to meaningfully reform the organisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also acknowledge the coroners findings that all forms of racism have existed within the Northern Territory police force at various times. That is confronting but it is a truth that we must face. What was tolerated in the past will no longer be acceptable. We are committed to stamping out racism. That includes seriously re-examining how we return to a meaningful version of community policing, one that reflects the needs and expectations of Aboriginal people and builds trust at a local level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has responded to the latest twist in United States President Donald Trump's tariff roll-out, saying Australia will not stop pushing for an exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\nShares on Wall Street have fallen after President Trump sent letters to 14 countries, including allies Japan and South Korea, unveiling sharply higher tariffs on imports into the United States, while postponing their implementation to August 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian goods to the US have already been subjected to the country's baseline 10 per cent tariffs, the minimum rate imposed on all US trading partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says he's not expecting a higher tariff rate as Australia hasn't proposed counter-tariffs on US goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, because we're not increasing tariffs.

I'm Catriona Stirrat.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has dismissed calls for a national task force to help address antisemitism, following a string of attacks targeting the community over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Executive Council of Australian Jewry is urging the government to adopt a 15-point action plan including the establishment of a national task force, and the Opposition has supported calls for a national cabinet to address the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says the federal government has provided action and funding to address antisemitism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every time an issue comes up, people say let's have a national cabinet. Let's be clear, what people want is not a meeting, they want action. Indeed on Saturday one of the reasons why this gentleman has been caught so quickly is because the CCTV that was in place there was as a direct result of federal government funding. In addition the reinforcement of that door of the synagogue was done with that Commonwealth security funding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Council of Australian Jewry President Daniel Aghion has also asked Victorian authorities to introduce protest zones to confine weekly pro-Palestine protests.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 34-year-old man Angelo Loras has been charged with arson and reckless conduct endangering life over the alleged firebombing of the East Melbourne synagogue on Saturday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same evening, a group of protesters disrupted diners and damaged property at Israeli restaurant Miznon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists are expecting the Reserve Bank will deliver its third interest rate cut of the year when it meets this afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney markets have priced in a 75 per cent chance official interest rates will fall to 3.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts say this is because both headline and underlying inflation are firmly within the Reserve Bank's 2 to 3 per cent target band.\n\n\n\n\n\nRabobank Senior Strategist Benjamin Picton says that is a result of lower demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Business are telling us there is not enough demand out there to soak up higher prices, so they no longer have pricing power, they no longer have the ability to pass on cost increases, so as a result we are starting to see discounting popping up in certain sectors of the economy, most notably home construction costs, we're starting to see discounting there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump has confirmed he will send additional weapons to Ukraine, after the White House announced a pause to some arms shipments for Kyiv the previous week.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of their respective staffs, Trump was asked if he planned to send more weapons for use by Kyiv.\n\n\n\n\n\nJOURNALIST: \"On Ukraine, Mr President, are you planning to send more weapons to Ukraine?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now. They're getting hit very hard. We're going to have to send more weapons, yeah, defensive weapons, primarily. But they're getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in that mess.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has launched some of the largest missile and drone attacks of the three-year war, and the Trump administration's pause on sending munitions posed a potentially serious challenge for Kyiv.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder former president Joe Biden, Washington provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump didn't follow suit upon his election, announcing no new military aid packages for Kyiv since he took office in January of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in cycling,\n\n\n\n\n\nBelgian rider Tim Merlier has won the third stage of the Tour de France after edging ahead of Italian Jonathan Milan in a chaotic sprint chase.\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo finish confirmed the line result in the coastal city of Dunkerque.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stage also saw another dramatic turn 60 kilometres from the end, when Belgian Jasper Philipsen was forced to withdraw from the race following a brutal collision with Bryan Coquard.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis team says he has fractured his collarbone and broken at least one rib and will require surgery.\n\n\n\n",

Labor continues on its spending spree and as the RBA itself has recognised, public sector spending is only leading to homegrown inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Until Labor starts reinstalling some discipline around fiscal responsibility, it will only make the job of the RBA harder.

The United Nations and its member states remain engaged on the future of Afghanistan and its people. And that is the main message of the resolution before us. As the facilitator of this resolution, Germany has actively engaged all UN member states over the past weeks and months.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe acknowledged that while many find the Taliban\u2019s governance deeply troubling, engagement remains unavoidable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs many others, Germany acknowledges that there is no alternative to engagement with the Taliban, and we will continue to actively contribute to the UN-led Doha process. We support the approach of the UN working groups and remain open for further pragmatic forms of cooperation with the de-facto authorities, including on the safe return of Afghan refugees.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Afghanistan\u2019s own representative to the UN painted a much bleaker picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharg\u00e9 d'Affaires Naseer Ahmad Faiq, who represents the ousted Islamic Republic, accused the Taliban of dragging the country backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Afghanistan is at a crossroads. Since August 2021, the country has experienced alarming regression across all sectors, social, political, economic, and human rights. Nearly four years under Taliban rule have driven Afghanistan into one of the world\u2019s gravest humanitarian and human rights crises, as extensively documented by the Secretary-General and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Faiq supported the resolution\u2019s call for inclusive governance and intra-Afghan dialogue, not Taliban rule by decree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe resolution rightly underscores that lasting peace in Afghanistan requires inclusive, representative, and participatory governance. We strongly support the call for a credible political process rooted in genuine intra-Afghan dialogue that reflects the diverse aspirations of all Afghans\u2014women, youth, minorities, and civil society. The Taliban are a group which \u2013 should they wish \u2013 be part of the solution to Afghanistan\u2019s crisis, but they can never be the sole solution by themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat message of cautious engagement comes at a delicate time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Russia officially recognised the Taliban government, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in August 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoscow\u2019s foreign ministry says it has accepted credentials from the Taliban\u2019s appointed ambassador and called it the start of productive bilateral cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi welcomed the decision, calling it \u201ca good example for other countries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNo other country has formally recognised the Taliban government that took over after US-led forces staged a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan following 20 years of war.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, China, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Pakistan have all designated ambassadors to Kabul, in a step towards recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taliban has been seeking international legitimacy, while maintaining strict enforcement of their version of Islamic law, including banning girls from secondary schools and restricting women from work and public life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN resolution is symbolic and carries no legal force, but it reflects global unease about rewarding a regime many still view as illegitimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The US has substantial reserves and resources of unmined copper, but only produced about half the 1.64 million tonnes of copper that it consumed last year. It gained another 150,000 or so tonnes from recycling but imported 810,000 tonnes of the refined metal. The challenge for the US is that it has copper in the ground but its smelting and refining capacity has shrunk over the past several decades. A slump in the copper price in the 1980s and 1990s led to the closure of US mines and smelters. In the late 1990s it still had 11 smelters in operation; today it has two, with a third that processes scrap. By contrast, China, which saw a strategic opportunity in the 1990s, made major investments in smelting and now has more than half the world\u2019s smelting capacity. Ore from the rest of the world is exported to China to be smelted and refined and then either increasingly consumed within China \u2013 which is leading the global electrification race \u2013 or re-exported. Given the centrality of copper to the 21st Century economy and advanced industrial and military technologies, China\u2019s dominance of the sector is obviously seen by the US as a national security threat.\n\nThe obvious response would be to produce and process more of its own copper. The problem it has is that most of its undeveloped resources are on federal land, which creates challenging and very lengthy approval processes. The average time to bring a new US mine into operation has blown out to about 29 years. The giant Resolution copper project in Arizona owned by Rio Tinto and BHP, for instance, was discovered in 1995. The Resolution Copper mine in Arizona. Credit: Darryl Webb Rio submitted a mine plan for the project, in which the companies have already invested several billion dollars, in 2013. It took until May this year for the US Supreme Court to clear the way for a land swap, opposed by native Americans, that will enable the project to proceed. It will take a decade or more to actually bring a mine into production. (BHP and Rio, via the giant Escondida mine in Chile will, incidentally, be exposed to the copper tariff, although more of that project\u2019s output is exported to Asia. Rio does have a mine \u2013 and a smelter \u2013 in the US that might benefit from the tariff and the higher domestic copper prices it will produce).\n\nAdding more domestic supply of copper might address the threat of supply shortages and the increasing reliance on Latin America (although the US has a free trade agreements with Chile, the major producer), but it doesn\u2019t solve the shortage of processing capacity. Loading Smelters take at least a decade and $US3 billion-plus of investment to construct and involve environmentally unfriendly processes, which is part of the explanation for why much of the global capacity migrated to China which, at the time, was more interested in economic and strategic benefits than its environment. Even if that capacity could be built in the US, it is unlikely to be competitive with China\u2019s smelters. China already has about 8 of the 20 largest copper smelters in the world. In the meantime, with the likelihood that Trump\u2019s new tariff will apply not only to imports of refined copper but downstream semi-fabricated products like copper sheeting and wire, US manufacturers reliant on copper will face a steep increase in costs.\n\nAmerica\u2019s reliance on imported copper, once the tariff is in place, means that those manufacturers will not only incur higher costs that they will try to pass onto their own customers, but those costs will be unique to the US and therefore they will, to the extent that they compete outside the US or with imports, be at a significant competitive disadvantage. The ubiquity of copper usage means that will be an economy-wide issue, adding to inflation while damaging US competitiveness. That\u2019s a familiar aspect of Trump\u2019s trade war on the rest of the world. US copper buyers have already seen a preview of what\u2019s to come within the differential in US copper prices and those in the rest of the world as traders scrambled to get in ahead of the tariffs. That rush to get their hands on physical metal not only forced the copper price to record levels, but has inverted the normal futures price curve for copper, known as contango, where future prices are higher than the spot price to reflect the costs of storage, opportunity costs and risk. The price curve is now in \u201cbackwardation\u201d \u2013 spot prices are higher than future prices, with the prospect of losses for traders and hedged sellers of copper as their contracts expire and they are forced to cover their exposures at higher prices.",

And when they last had a tactical direction, which feels like a lifetime ago, it wasn\u2019t this one, with Tony Gustavsson\u2019s preference to play a more transitional game. There were times when we saw it come to life, times when it broke down, and times when it didn\u2019t look like there was a plan at all. That\u2019s natural, given the circumstances: players are at the end of their seasons, many have had to be managed carefully, and chemistry can\u2019t just be built overnight when you\u2019re throwing together an unfamiliar team under a new coach who says he only knows one way of working. Behind the Matildas: Leanne Hall, Emanuele Chiappero, Joe Palatsides, head coach Joe Montemurro, Tony Franken and Emily Husband. Credit: Getty Images Fortunately, it\u2019s unlikely to get worse. The players to come in are more technically adept at executing Montemurro\u2019s plan, though being able to limit turnovers and stroke the ball around for long periods has proven a challenge for many of them in the past. And the ones who had a taste of it in this window can go away and work on what they know they\u2019ll be asked to do next time they\u2019re called in.\n\nThe midfield remains a puzzle Most people thought Paris 2024 would be Gorry\u2019s last tournament. Now she\u2019s about to turn 33 but she\u2019s still kicking around. But does she come straight back into this team when she\u2019s fit again? Should she, given the progress made by Wheeler (a late withdrawal from this window) and Cooney-Cross as a tandem midfield pairing? And where does Emily van Egmond fit into the picture, if anywhere? Matildas veteran Katrina Gorry. Credit: Visionhaus via Getty Images Montemurro rifled through a bunch of different combinations in this window \u2013 including the use of Kennedy as a defensive midfielder, which is where she plays for Angel City FC \u2013 to try and figure out how many viable options he may have to work with in future. Going back to the likes of Alex Chidiac and Chloe Berryhill didn\u2019t go too well, and opinion is split as ever on van Egmond. If the Asian Cup was tomorrow, the make-up of the midfield would be anyone\u2019s guess right now. Montemurro really needs to get some flying hours into the ones he deems to be first-choice to help them build up as much synergy as they can, as quickly as they can.\n\nAmy Sayer has finally arrived Sayer was 16 years old when made her international debut at the 2018 Tournament of Nations \u2013 in the same window as Fowler, who was 15. But as Fowler\u2019s career exploded in the ensuing years, Sayer chose to take the US college route, and became a bit out of sight, out of mind. An ACL injury amplified that. She came close, but Gustavsson never picked her in the squad for a major tournament. Amy Sayer and Joe Montemurro. Credit: Getty Images Now 23, Sayer has come on in leaps and bounds. She has been arguably the \u201cfind\u201d of the last few months, stealing the spotlight in Tom Sermanni\u2019s final games in charge and then keeping that momentum rolling under Montemurro. Best used as a No.10, she can also play out wide in attack, and her poise and vision are, if not Fowler-esque, then of the same genre. She can be a huge player for the Matildas for many years to come.\n\nThe Matildas have depth in defence For once! The emergence of Jamilla Rankin and the development of Courtney Nevin and Charli Grant mean that Montemurro will have the incredible luxury of using Catley as a centre-back. Matildas defender Jamilla Rankin (right) in action against Panama. Credit: Getty Images And with Clare Hunt kicking on and Heatley making big strikes, there\u2019s now red-hot competition for who should partner her \u2013 as well as, in the case of Kennedy, the possibility of more time anchoring the midfield rather than the back four. Factor in Carpenter on the other side, who will no doubt be rejuvenated by her move to Chelsea, and the Matildas suddenly have what they\u2019ve not really had in a number of years: true depth in defence.\n\nThere\u2019s no room for sentiment in selection anymore We mentioned van Egmond and Gorry before. What about Tameka Yallop? Or Emily Gielnik? For every player like Hayley Raso or Michelle Heyman who can demonstrate their unarguable worth to the team, there\u2019s a fellow veteran who might be coasting along on reputation rather than currency. The idea of peak van Egmond, for example, is compelling. But how often do we see that idea in a match? Same goes for Chidiac. And while some of these established players are vital for dressing room morale, or in the case of Yallop and Gielnik are incredibly versatile, at what point do they risk being overtaken by emerging talents who can offer as much, if not more? Are we there yet? Possibly. Emily van Egmond. Credit: Getty Images These are the sort of questions Montemurro needs to consider carefully. If he can\u2019t see a future for a player at Matildas level, and can\u2019t be sure that someone else couldn\u2019t do their job better at the Asian Cup, then he needs to tap them on the shoulder, because every minute matters right now.",

        "text": "Sophie alleged that Wallace had groped her while she was standing at a bar with him and his co-host, John Torode, at the 2013 series wrap party, doing it \u201ccovertly\u201d so that Torode did not notice. She did not complain at the time because she feared being \u201cbooted off\u201d the MasterChef team. Another MasterChef crew member, known as Alice, alleged that Wallace invited her into his dressing room in 2012, saying that he needed help getting changed into black tie, then pushed her down onto a sofa and pulled his trousers down. She reported the \u201cdisgusting and predatory\u201d behaviour to the independent production company which made the show, but was allegedly told by a senior member of the production team: \u201cYou\u2019re over 16, you\u2019re not being \u2018Jimmy Saviled\u2019.\u201d Allegations spanning decades\n\nThe allegations date back to 2002, when a participant on the BBC\u2019s Saturday Kitchen \u2013 which was at the time produced in-house by the BBC\u2013 said that Wallace put a hand on her groin during a pre-show dinner and asked: \u201cDo you like that?\u201d Gregg Wallace (right) with MasterChef co-host, Australian-born John Torode. Credit: The Telegraph\u2019s investigation heard from a junior production worker on the show who alleged that Wallace groped her breasts and bottom, but she dared not speak out for fear of losing her job. She said that Wallace\u2019s conduct appeared to be condoned by senior members of staff who worked on the program. \u201cIt was like no one else had a problem with what was happening, so I couldn\u2019t have a problem either,\u201d she said. While MasterChef in the UK is made by Banijay, an independent production company, it is on the BBC\u2019s list of eight \u201cflagship programmes\u201d which have special status owing to the length of time they have been established and how popular they are with audiences \u2013 raising questions of why there was no oversight from BBC management.\n\nThe new allegations about Wallace and the findings of the review will pile fresh pressure on Davie, the BBC director-general, who is already facing criticism over his handling of Bob Vylan\u2019s controversial set at Glastonbury. The BBC is also braced for a highly critical report into its decision to broadcast a Gaza documentary without sufficient checks to establish that the child narrator was the son of a Hamas minister. Wallace stepped back from MasterChef in November after a number of allegations came to light. He had co-presented the show since 2005. In a statement ahead of the report\u2019s publication, and anticipating the BBC\u2019s new allegations, Wallace said: \u201cAfter 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others.\u201d He claimed that the report will clear him of serious wrongdoing but will find him \u201cprimarily guilty of inappropriate language\u201d.\n\n\u201cI recognise that some of my humour and language, at times, was inappropriate. For that, I apologise without reservation,\u201d he said. Loading He previously admitted to opening his dressing room door and shouting \u201chooray\u201d while naked except for a sock on his penis, but said this was after the day\u2019s filming had finished. Wallace hits back at BBC He hit out at the BBC News allegations, saying: \u201cThe BBC is no longer providing balanced and impartial public service journalism. It is peddling baseless and sensationalised gossip masquerading as properly corroborated stories.\n\n\u201cThe BBC is choosing to allow BBC News to run with this uncorroborated tittle-tattle in an attempt to \u2018get ahead\u2019 of the Silkin summary report and derail what has been an extremely thorough process. \u201cThis feels to me like BBC News is chasing slanderous clickbait rather than delivering impartial journalism.\u201d The 60-year-old presenter complained that his suspected autism had made the MasterChef studio \u201ca dangerous environment\u201d for him. He added: \u201cI was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all. For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.\u201d Kirsty Wark, the former Newsnight presenter, claimed that Wallace had told \u201csexualised\u201d jokes while she was a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef in 2011.\n\nWallace hit back by saying that the complaints were coming from \u201ca handful of middle-class women of a certain age,\u201d a comment for which he later apologised. He said in his statement that \u201cthe most damaging claims including allegations from public figures\u2026 have not been upheld [and] were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six-month investigation.\u201d Wallace also suggested that some of his behaviour was down to autism and criticised bosses for failing to take that into account. \u201cMy neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef. \u201cYet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years. That failure is now being quietly buried,\u201d he said. Wallace suggested that others were guilty of more serious offences than him, but that their behaviour would be brushed under the carpet.",

        "text": "Ahead of the third Test on Saturday (Sunday morning AEST), this masthead spoke to the trio \u2013 and coach Andrew McDonald \u2013 about Starc\u2019s impact on the team and his imminent entry into an exclusive club: he\u2019s just the second Australian fast bowler, after Glenn McGrath, and 16th Australian to play 100 Tests. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll actually see that [commitment] again, especially in the next few generations,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cThe amount of pride that Starcy puts on that baggy green is incredible.\u201d Australia captain Alyssa Healy will not be in Jamaica for her husband Mitchell Starc\u2019s 100th Test. Credit: Getty The captain\u2019s view As one of Starc\u2019s longest-serving teammates, Cummins knows better than anyone how difficult it is to play 100 Tests as a fast bowler. Cummins made his Test debut against South Africa a fortnight before Starc was given a baggy green against New Zealand in December 2011.\n\nThe NSW pair has bowled together for the best part of 15 years, and Cummins has the utmost respect for Starc\u2019s resilience. So high is Starc\u2019s standing in Cummins\u2019 eyes, that he still gets the new ball over the skipper. Australia\u2019s captain Pat Cummins talks to bowler Mitchell Starc on day three of the first cricket Test match against West Indies at Kensington Stadium in Bridgetown, Barbados. Credit: AP \u201cWe\u2019ll come up with something [to celebrate]. It\u2019s a huge effort,\u201d Cummins, who has played 55 of his 70 Tests with Starc, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty small crew that have played 100 Tests. He\u2019s the second fast bowler, which is really rare and tough to do. Proud of him. \u201cHe\u2019s still bowling 145km/h at the end [of the recent Test against the West Indies]. I can\u2019t fathom playing 100 games and keeping that kind of speed. He\u2019s a warrior, turns up every week and just cracks on. He\u2019s such a low-fuss kind of guy. All things going well, it\u2019ll be a great week for him.\u201d\n\nHazlewood: \u2018It\u2019s the late night physio sessions\u2019 Hazlewood, a year younger than Starc, is another close friend and a constant presence in Australia\u2019s attack. The pair has played 59 Tests together. Hazlewood, who debuted three years after Starc in Tests, reflected on the unseen side of Starc\u2019s longevity \u2013 the mental and physical toll fast bowling takes on the body. \u201cOne of the things I admire is the work ethic,\u201d Hazlewood said. \u201cEveryone just sees you play the games and don\u2019t see much else. Being in his shoes as well, and being around it for so long, you see everything that goes into it. It\u2019s the late night physio treatment sessions. Josh Hazlewood of Australia celebrates a wicket with Mitchell Starc in January 2024. Credit: Getty \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing achievement to play 100 Tests. It\u2019ll be awesome to be part of it.\u201d\n\nAsked if there was a spell or match that he vividly remembers Starc being at the peak of his powers, Hazlewood said: \u201cI think you see snippets of it nearly every game. You know when he\u2019s in your team, wickets can fall in a heap, whether it be up front, in the middle or the tail. If he gets the ball in hand and gets on a roll, he can go bang, bang, bang and turn the game on its head. No matter the conditions, no matter the opposition, no matter the situation, he can turn the game on its head in space with two overs.\u201d Lyon: Why Starc is special Lyon, Australia\u2019s most prolific off-spinner, has played in all but five of Starc\u2019s 99 Tests. He has seen it all. \u201cHow long have we got?\u201d Lyon said. \u201cI\u2019ll be over the moon. I\u2019ll probably get emotional seeing him play and go out there. I\u2019ve seen the work and the injuries he\u2019s been through. He\u2019s basically the first picked in every Australian cricket team in my life. \u201cStarcy is special. He\u2019s the ultimate professional in the way he prepares and also recovers. For him to be on the verge of 100 Test matches \u2026 and be the second fast bowler, I feel like that\u2019s a phenomenal record.\n\n\u201cThe number of times that he plays through pain or injury or soreness is phenomenal.\u201d Lyon is adamant Starc is still bowling as well as ever. This year, he\u2019s averaging 20.86 with the ball. \u201cTo be honest with you, I feel like over the last 12 months, it\u2019s probably the best that Starcy\u2019s ever bowled,\u201d Lyon said. Nathan Lyon celebrates with Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. Credit: AP\n\n\u201cThe rhythm that he bowled with in the World Test Championship final a couple of weeks ago was incredible viewing. Even when he\u2019s not at his best, he finds a way. He\u2019s just that competitor that you want to play with.\u201d A coach\u2019s love Loading McDonald opened the batting against Starc in his final first-class match in 2014. Eleven years on, Starc is a stalwart in the team he coaches and selects. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible achievement,\u201d McDonald said.",

Source: Invasive Species Council/Chris Per\n\nDash cam footage has captured the shocking moment two drivers almost collided with an invasive pest after it darted across a busy road, highlighting an \u201cincreasingly common problem\u201d plaguing Aussie cities.\n\nVideo of the incredibly close call filmed \u201cin the middle of Canberra\u201d shows a large feral deer suddenly appear on a grass median strip before bolting across two lanes of traffic, just metres in front of startled motorists who couldn\u2019t help but exclaim \u201cwhat the f***\u201d.\n\nConcerningly, the dangerous encounter is becoming a more frequent occurrence as one of the country\u2019s most problematic introduced species continue to spill onto roads.\n\n\u201cThis is an increasingly common problem in our cities as feral deer numbers have exploded, and governments have failed to invest enough to effectively control them,\u201d the Invasive Species Council said on Wednesday when sharing the dash cam footage. \u201cWe are seeing more and more feral deer on train lines, crossing roads and trashing and trampling our precious places.\u201d\n\nDeer were introduced in the early 1800s by European settlers \u2014 mainly imported for recreational hunting \u2014 but because they have no natural predators here, numbers have risen exponentially across the entire continent, but they are particularly common in Victoria, NSW and Tasmania.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier this year, South Australian residents said an \u201cavalanche\u201d of the feral invaders had started wreaking havoc in their gardens and posing a series threat on roads.\n\nAs well as the danger of collision, deer \u201ctrash and eat native vegetation, ringbark trees, create wallows, trample undergrowth and spread weed seeds, all things that threaten the survival of native flora and fauna,\u201d National Deer Management Coordinator for the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions, Dr Annelise Wiebkin, previously told Yahoo News.\n\nIn 2021, deer were responsible for costing the Australian economy approximately $91.3 million, largely due to agricultural losses. The economic impact also extends to infrastructure, with deer-related motor vehicle collisions causing an estimated $3.3 million in damages, as well as $1.2 million in train collisions.\n\nThere's estimated to be between one and two million deer in Australia, with their introduced pest regularly spilling onto roads. Source: Tasmanian Government\n\nInvasive Species Council argues shooting lobby responsible for deer explosion\n\nAccording to the Invasive Species Council, the pest\u2019s numbers have grown exponentially in part due to pressure from the shooting lobby \u201cdelaying, undermining and stopping effective feral deer control\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt surprises many people to discover the shooting lobby are the reason feral deer numbers are so high and growing, but the truth is that they spent decades stopping deer being declared a pest in NSW and are still working hard to keep them protected under law as \u2018game animals\u2019 in Victoria and Tasmania,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to have our national parks and state forests become game reserves for their sport \u2014 but we all cop the consequences of this.\u201d\n\nTo reduce feral deer populations, the ISC said \u201cwell-funded professional control programs based on thermal assisted aerial control\u201d are necessary. Since 2021 the ACT Government has been using this technology to help detect and cull the animals, with local experts telling the ABC earlier this year that the program had \u201cpositive results\u201d.\n\nThe ISC argues that while recreational ground shooting alone \u201cis generally ineffective for population control, it can contribute to effective control as a supplement to other methods or in easily accessible small areas\u201d such as farms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe support strategic collaborations with recreational shooters aligned with coordinated well-planned programs that have clear targets,\u201d it said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to be clear that recreational hunting is a supplementary, not primary, solution and that these programs often involve very high bureaucratic costs for already stretched agencies.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Picture: NewsWire / Jeremy Piper\n\nDivorces are becoming less common because of the heightened cost of living, an Australian lawyer says, with government data backing up the anecdotal evidence.\n\n\u201cThe question we\u2019re hearing more and more is: Can either of us afford to live after this?\u201d family law specialist Kylie Burke said.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, we\u2019re seeing more disputes over school fees, medical costs and even basic shared-care logistics \u2013 because everyone is under pressure.\u201d\n\nGovernment data shows divorce rates in 2023 hit their lowest since the mid-70s.\n\nThe rate of divorce in Australia has decelerated over the past few decades but not as abruptly as the marriage rate. Picture: NewsWire / Brenton Edwards\n\nIn 1975, no-fault divorce was written into law, removing the need to prove adultery or desertion, meaning divorces could be granted because of irreconcilable differences.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDivorce rates fell by almost half over the next decade and have gradually tapered down since, as the overall marriage rate continues to dip at an even quicker rate.\n\nIn 1976, 6.3 people (aged over 16) per 1000 got divorced versus 13 people per 1000 getting married.\n\nIn 2023, 2.3 people per 1000 called it quits, while 5.5 per 1000 tied the knot.\n\nBurke Mangan Lawyers partner Ms Burke said she was seeing more and more couples stay together because they could not afford to live separately.\n\nAustralian marriage rates have fallen about one-third since the turn of the century. Picture: NewsWire / Nikki Short\n\n\u201cDividing assets is just one part of the picture now \u2013 it\u2019s also about ensuring both parties can afford to live, support the children and plan for their financial future,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith rents up 30 per cent in some capital cities and lending conditions tight, many people are being forced to stay under the same roof \u2013 even after they\u2019ve split.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe old model, where one person keeps the home and the other rents nearby, is increasingly off the table.\u201d\n\nLiving together after separation was called \u201cfinancial flatmates\u201d among lawyers, and \u201cfraught with emotional and legal risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt might feel like a short-term fix, but without proper agreements in place, they often lead to major conflict down the track,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "It's the largest national park expansion in a generation, but environmental groups say there's still more that needs to be done.\n\nLocals and tourists alike flock to Litchfield for camping, swimming and hiking, and now there will be even more to love. Source: Getty\n\nOne of Australia\u2019s most iconic national parks is about to undergo a drastic change. Litchfield National Park in the Northern Territory is about to expand by 30,000 hectares, with more campgrounds, walking trails and even a hunting range being opened to the public. But while the announcement has been largely applauded, environmental groups say more needs to be done to protect the territory's landscape.\n\nThe expansion follows the government's $7.5 million purchase of 'Silkwood', a stunning parcel of land near the regional town of Adelaide River, boasting waterfalls, gorges, hot springs and 4WD tracks. Described as the largest addition to the Territory\u2019s national park estate in 25 years, the acquisition will increase the park\u2019s size by 20 per cent.\n\nChief Minister Lia Finocchiaro said the expansion was a key part of her government\u2019s vision to \u201crestore the Territory lifestyle\u201d.\n\nThe land purchase include waterfalls, gorges, hot springs and 4WD tracks. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what restoring the Territory lifestyle looks like \u2014 protecting our wide-open spaces while making sure Territorians have more places to enjoy the activities we love,\u201d she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe new southern section of the park will eventually be opened up for camping, swimming, four-wheel-driving, exploring, and potentially hunting, delivering a boost for tourism and recreation in the region, local authorities say.\n\n\"Silkwood boasts untapped tourism potential,\" a spokesperson from the NT\u2019s Department of Tourism and Hospitality told Yahoo News.\n\n\"It's positioned amidst breathtaking scenery, offering unparalleled access to an abundance of natural attractions and neighbouring Litchfield National Park. It\u2019s close proximity to Darwin and being along the Stuart Highway makes it an ideal stop off location for self-drive tourists.\"\n\nThe popular Robin Falls is included in the new expansion, with Finocchiaro promising visitors they can still bring their leashed dogs.\n\nAn opening date is yet to be set, with planning and budgeting underway for roads, pathways, signage and viewing platforms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Work around the planning of this site is in the early stages. There will be more detailed master-planning conducted for the site later this year,\" the Tourism spokesperson told Yahoo.\n\nIt comes just weeks after South Australia announced extensions to three national parks, adding an extra 725 acres to their estate of protected land.\n\nMore should be done to protect Territory's landscape, environmentalists say\n\nEnvironment Centre Northern Territory (ECNT) Executive Director, Kirsty Howey, called the deal \u201ca positive step\u201d, but told Yahoo News the government could be doing more to protect local lands.\n\n\"The Finocchiaro government has abandoned its commitment to deliver a 43 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, scrapped our renewable energy target, and unleashed bulldozers on the world's last intact tropical savanna,\" Howey said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The scale of destruction is staggering, yet it occurs largely hidden from public view on pastoral estates that comprise 45 per cent of the Territory\u2019s land.\"\n\nIn the first six months of this year, Howey said, the Finocchiaro government approved the destruction of almost 26,000 hectares of native vegetation \u2014 close to the size of the Litchfield expansion.\n\nThe impending public expansion comes after South Australia also increased access to public national park lands. Source: NT Government\n\nShe pointed to the Pastoral Land Board as a key issue, accusing it of routinely approving large-scale land clearing.\n\n\u201cWeek after week, thousands of hectares receive rubber-stamp approval for bulldozing,\u201d she said. \u201cOn 13 June, this same board... approved clearing 3,300 hectares at Claravale Station. This isn't just any paddock, this site contains one of only five confirmed maternity roosts for ghost bats in the entire Territory.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"If habitat for bilbies and Gouldian finches were being destroyed at this rate near Melbourne or Sydney, there would be public outrage.\"\n\nAdding to the concern is the spread of gamba grass, a highly invasive species that dramatically increases fire risk. Experts warn that if left unchecked, the weed could overtake more than 42,000 hectares of Litchfield by 2032.\n\n\u201cWith more than 250,000 visitors annually, Litchfield faces a silent threat,\u201d Howey said. \u201cGamba grass creates extreme fire risks that endanger both visitors and the park\u2019s unique ecosystems.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story tip?
