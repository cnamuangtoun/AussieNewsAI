        "text": "Even by crypto standards, it's been a rough few weeks.\n\nInvestors in digital assets are accustomed to extreme volatility, but a US$1 trillion ($1.55 trillion) wipeout over the past six weeks has tested even crypto's diehard believers and alienated many of its newest converts.\n\nBitcoin, the industry bellwether, has fallen dramatically since early October, when it hit a record high of US$126,000 ($194,895).\n\nBitcoin is struggling in a volatile crypto market. (CNN)\n\nThe world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below US$81,000 ($125,290) on Friday before recovering slightly over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday, as the broader stock market rallied, bitcoin topped US$88,000 ($136,117), rising nearly 2 per cent over a 24-hour period. (Crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.)\n\nIt is shaping up to be one of crypto's worst months on record, and it's not clear the market has bottomed out.\n\n\"Whether Bitcoin stabilises after this correction remains uncertain,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.\n\nThe broader stock market has rallied. (Bloomberg)\n\n\"Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year's downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends.\"\n\nWhile crypto's fate has broadly mirrored the stock market's in recent years, its current angst runs deeper. That's largely thanks to an influx of mainstream money that behaves very differently from the funds controlled by a typical crypto investor.\n\nBitcoin is in a bear market, having dropped 30 per cent from its most recent high, while the S&P 500 is down just 3 per cent from its most recent peak. It is on track for its worst month since the 2022 crypto \"winter\" that culminated in the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.\n\nMuch hangs over the Federal Reserve's next rate cut. (AP Photo/J Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nAnxiety is coursing through stocks and crypto for two key reasons: Investors are fretting over the Federal Reserve's next rate cut, and they're worrying about whether AI is a bubble that'll blow up in their faces.\n\nAll of that weighs on crypto traders because digital assets, like tech stocks, are especially sensitive to changes in the Fed's benchmark rate, which affects the cost of borrowing money and can quickly sap investor appetite for risk.\n\nBut crypto investors have an additional hangover to deal with following an October 10 flash crash.\n\nTrump's trade war with China prompted many to get out of the crypto market. (AP)\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China that day, it prompted a wave of panic-selling that triggered automatic liquidations across the highly leveraged crypto market.\n\nIn a single day, the flash crash wiped out US$19 billion ($29.4 billion) worth of crypto. For a lot of folks, the stomach-churning crash was all the motivation they needed to exit crypto completely, and that's left bitcoin and other tokens more susceptible to volatility.\n\nThe flash crash forced many investors sell their holdings to meet margin calls. That tends to have a snowball effect: The more bitcoin falls, the more calls investors face from their brokerages, the more they have to sell their bitcoin (and other holdings) to cover their positions.\n\nWhat makes this crypto crash different is the presence of billions of dollars that have entered the crypto market through spot bitcoin funds that US regulators approved last year.\n\nMainstream investors got into crypto to enjoy the ride up, but they don't have the same level of devotion to the ideology as early adopters who are bolstered by intense online communities encouraging one another to buy the dip and keep the faith.\n\n\"The bottom line is, bitcoin is for normies now,\" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said.\n\n\"As a result, the normies are going to view it as another speculative holding in their portfolio \u2026 it's going to be treated like a volatile mainstream investment.\"",

We're by-products of each other on the field and we have some really good times off the field as well,\" Riddell said in her speech.\n\nAsh Riddell (left) and Jasmine Garner have helped each other out during the Kangaroos' rise. (AAP: James Ross)\n\nWatching them together on the field, it's hard to argue against it.\n\nLike Riddell's steady rise, the conversation around the Kangaroos before their 2024 maiden flag win was that they were good, but weren't the best.\n\nThey couldn't beat the other \"top-four sides\" in Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne.\n\nIt's a clich\u00e9, but nevertheless true, to say the Kangaroos just stuck to their systems, put their heads down and kept working.\n\nNow they have a 26-match winning streak, have gone two home-and-away seasons undefeated and will head into their third consecutive grand final on Saturday.\n\nAnd like Riddell on the biggest awards night for the competition, the Kangaroos will go into the season decider as the favourites, after many years of being in the \"maybe this year\" conversation.",

This is what the drivers behind your packages want you to know.\n\nThe gig economy has been an outlier while continuing to grow through an increase in customer demand, the scale of operators and technological innovation.\n\nCompanies have resisted regulating delivery workers as staff, and have sought changes to the law to allow them to create quasi-employees.\n\nThis deal, if ratified, could become the standard for other forms of gig-based work.\n\n\"Uber Eats has long supported sensible and modern reforms that strengthen protections and benefits for delivery people, while maintaining the flexibility that is central to gig work,\" said Ed Kitchen, managing director for Uber Eats Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\" We believe fair standards and flexibility should not be mutually exclusive. \"\n\nRecently, Menulog joined the list of failed delivery operators in Australia, with its collapse coming after that of Foodora and Deliveroo.",

People will love it.\n\nThe only problem was, a loud group didn't.\n\nArtist impression of aerial view of Perth Park (Perth Entertainment and Sporting Precinct) in Burswood. (Supplied: WA government)\n\nBy May, the government had seemingly rebranded the project to the 'Perth Entertainment and Sporting Precinct', framing it as a multi-use community hub, rather than a motorsport street circuit.\n\nNow, it's had a second name change to something simpler \u2014 'Perth Park' \u2014 although time will tell whether this rebrand will win over critics or be another band-aid for a wound that's bleeding quickly.\n\nShift in focus\n\nThe gripe most critics have had are with the project's former main element \u2014 the racetrack.\n\nBut this latest rebrand makes sure that's well and truly buried.\n\nOn the project's website, all mentions of the multi-use track carefully position the motorsport element as more of an aside.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook and Minister for Sport and Recreation Rita Saffioti reveal details of 'Perth Park' on Sunday. (ABC News: Lauren Smith)\n\n\"For cycling training and competitions, as well as an annual motorsport street circuit event,\" the website reads.\n\nThat's a vastly different focus to the government's original pitch to voters when Premier Roger Cook posed for photos inside a V8 Supercar.\n\n\"Today we're announcing that we will transform this park into a world class entertainment precinct,\" Mr Cook said in January.\n\n\"If elected, a WA Labor government will build a Perth street circuit. This is something that people have talked about for years, now it's starting to happen.\"\n\nRoger Cook sat in a V8 Supercar as the track proposal was announced. (Facebook: Roger Cook)\n\nThe Premier said the street circuit would \"put WA on the global motorsports map\" just like Townsville or the Gold Coast, but a project update over the weekend was not quite so racetrack focused.\n\n\"[New released pictures] show our plan for the area which will include a new multi-purpose building which will offer a range of event, function and meeting spaces \u2026 our first ever dedicated outdoor amphitheatre venue for up to 12,000 people, a new multi-use track that will support a range of uses including cycling and annual motorsport street circuit events,\" Mr Cook said on Sunday.\n\nHe also tried out the rebranded name on the tongue.\n\nThe announcement of the project triggered a backlash from some residents. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\n\"Where will I see you? I'll see you at Perth Park,\" he said.\n\n\" We'll get off at the Stadium Station and we'll come down here and watch some incredible sports and entertainment events. \"\n\nDeputy Premier Rita Saffioti backed him up, steadfast that the project had been clear from the outset.\n\n\"We've always outlined from the initial press conference that we held just here, we outlined that there was three components to this project,\" she said at the site.\n\n\"Which included a multi-use track, it included an amphitheatre which \u2026 has been something that has been wanted by the music industry.\"\n\nFuel to the fire\n\nRebrand aside, the government would have hoped the project's business case, released over the weekend, would quash criticism given it confirmed two things.\n\nThe project's $217 million price tag has stayed the same and the individual racetrack component costs $23 million.\n\n\"About a tenth of the total cost is the multi-use racetrack which is for both supercars and cycling, so again some of the claims out there saying $217 million for a racetrack is completely false,\" Ms Saffioti said.\n\nBut for the project's opponents, it added fuel to the fire.\n\nBasil Zempilas has been a vocal critic of the project. (ABC News: Phoebe Pin)\n\n\"Do others not see what a miracle this is that \u2026 after all of the changes and iterations that apparently the government have been working through, they've still landed on exactly the same number that they announced 10 months ago, $217.5 million,\" Opposition Leader Basil Zempilas said on Sunday.\n\nThe summary, prepared by independent economics firm ACIL Allen, importantly outlined new figures the government could stand by.\n\nTensions grow as images of Burswood plan released The deputy premier accuses the Town of Victoria Park of lying to ratepayers over the controversial $217 million entertainment and sporting precinct in Burswood.\n\n\"People will never be satisfied until their argument wins the day \u2026 the economics suggest that Perth Park will deliver a $61 million return to the West Australian economy,\" Mr Cook said on Monday morning.\n\nThe business case might be released, but a looming question mark still remains about a piece of land needed for the project currently in Crown's possession.\n\nMr Cook said negotiations were \"advanced\" and \"going well\" with further costs for the piece of land on top of the $217 million still not anticipated.\n\nRegardless, the government will be hoping its second crack at rebranding this project will stick, or they'll have to get back to the drawing board to think of more names.",

And Australian unions were never gonna leave behind these workers. \" \"We knew when they started joining their union, the TWU, the poverty wages they were on and how much they were being pushed to complete orders. \"Unfortunately, throughout this eight-year fight, we've seen some workers be killed because they were pushed so hard by the algorithm to deliver orders quickly in our big cities and forced to drive (in) dangerous conditions. And you know, it's in their memory too, that these laws are here.\"\n\nSadly, the number of delivery riders killed in recent years is too numerous to list, but the ABC has covered many including, Burak Dogan, Dede Fredy and Xiaojun Chen.\n\n\"We would never accept the fact that some workers in our country had less rights than workers did a hundred years ago. \"We worked with the Labor government to get new laws in place that gave them the legal minimums but new laws are one thing, putting them in action is another thing and that's due to the work of the TWU and the members who have negotiated with these huge multinationals UberEats and DoorDash to put in place minimum standards which are going to lead quite frankly, to very significant pay increases for these workers as well as protection in terms of insurance for them and to make sure that they have basic rights that other workers have to be properly consulted about how their work happens.\n\nThe laws also put in protections against summary dismissal.

(ABC News: Jonathon Kendall)\n\nThe program's coordinator and midwife, Serena Pellizzeri, is fast to list the benefits of that one-on-one care.\n\n\"Better birth outcomes, better experiences, better continuity, and we know it creates great workforce sustainability as well for our midwives, and it's actually cost-effective,\" she said.\n\nThe program differs from some other public programs that offer a team of rotating midwives or shared care with doctors.\n\nBut accessing the popular MGP program can be tough due to demand, eligibility and limited midwife staffing.\n\nSome pregnant women turn to private midwives for continuity of care. (ABC News: Erin Somerville)\n\nThe ABC contacted 69 publicly funded Victorian hospitals and health services, with just 17 confirming that they offered MGP or primary midwife models of care, while six did not respond.\n\nOf those services that offered these programs, they generally catered to less than 20 per cent of births.\n\n\"We have recognised how popular the program is and we are currently under an expansion,\" said Ms Pellizzeri, whose program is also facing pressure from fast population growth.\n\nTurning to private care\n\nOne regional Victorian private midwife said it was unfair that many pregnant women, particularly in regional areas, were unable to access maternity care for free.\n\nLindsay Coward wants more women to be able to access free antenatal care. (ABC News: Erin Somerville)\n\nMidwife Lindsay Coward said many women who could not access her region's unique local Maternity Antenatal Postnatal program, which caters to about 300 of the 1,500 annual births, paid for a private midwife, while there were increasingly fewer local GPs or obstetricians offering care.\n\nMs Coward, who works privately, said she would like more regional women to have less restricted access to free and comprehensive antenatal care.\n\n\"The aim would be that women would have the first option to be able to be seen freely, and if they chose to see someone privately that would be at their discretion, not because they had no other options,\" she said.\n\nLindsay Coward checks patient Tiarne Sainty's blood pressure. (ABC News: Erin Somerville)\n\nShe said it was not uncommon for some women who were unable to access public maternity services to miss antenatal appointments due to financial pressure.\n\n\"We really would want to see women at all of the key markers as opposed to when they feel they can afford it,\" Ms Coward said.\n\nShe said some private midwives were pushing for hospital admitting rights to help plug the gap and improve continuity of care.\n\nTiarne Sainty attends a private midwife appointment. (ABC News: Erin Somerville)\n\nWodonga resident Tiarne Sainty chose to use a private midwife and birth in her local public hospital, with continuity of care playing an important role in that decision, even though she was unable to access her private midwife during labour.\n\n\"I think pregnancy and childbirth is a huge journey and it's nice to get that same friendly face every appointment that really understands and gets to know you and your baby,\" she said.\n\nStrengthening personalised care\n\nThe Victorian government last year announced the establishment of the Victorian Maternity Taskforce to implement best models of care, particularly in rural and regional areas.\n\nThe maternity taskforce has made recommendations to improve care. (ABC News: Lisa Mctiernan)\n\nThe taskforce this month released a report with nine key recommendations to improve access, choice, and outcomes for women and babies, including the development of personalised care that prioritised choice and experience for women.\n\nAustralian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Victoria branch assistant secretary, Nicole Allen, said there were many reports backing the MGP program and the continuity of care it offered as being \"gold standard\", and it should be more accessible.\n\n\"We know that women want these services and currently in Victoria they only offer up to about 10 per cent of the model of care in the public health system, and in regional services that's much less of course because they're more concentrated in metro,\" she said.\n\nNicole Allen says reports show the benefits of the MGP program. (ABC News: Tara Whitchurch)\n\n\"I think while there may not need to be more money funded into them, there needs to be more funnelling into the MGP stream because we can develop them at a relatively low cost. They're actually quite cost efficient.\"\n\nThe Victorian government said it planned to work to strengthen MGP programs based on the taskforce's recommendations.\n\n\"We continue to see strong demand for Midwifery Group Practice across Victoria \u2014 it's why we're investing $270 million to grow our nurse and midwife workforce and invest in a range of maternity care initiatives,\" a Victorian government spokesperson said.",

        "text": "Clay Crighton (previously on piano and violin, who also contributed original music and lyrics) is a second-act show-stealer as Charley Parkhurst, a hilarious drag caricature of a rival outlaw. His entrance interrupts a long and scattered argument between the townsfolk about new and old values. The most conservative voice is then conveniently shot by dainty hand, and his death promptly passed over by a hammy, action-packed shoot-out. Lord knows the messages of Cowbois are important in a backsliding world. But this desperado could do with more fire in the belly, their steed a swift kick with sharp spurs. MUSIC\n\nBach Mass in B minor\n\nSydney Chamber Choir\n\nCity Recital Hall, November 22\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd With his genius for contrapuntal combinations carrying deep musical and symbolic significance, Bach constructed the great four-part fugue, Donna Nobis Pacem, which concludes the Mass in B minor, so the pleas for peace pile harmoniously on top of one another, each beginning before the previous one has ceased and overreaching it (a \u201cstretto\u201d in musical terms) to create a sonic image of collective yearning.\n\nThe swelling sonority and translucent texture of the Sydney Chamber Choir and the Muffat Collective orchestra under Sam Allchurch in this number encapsulated all the virtues of the performance that it brought to such a glowing close: clarity, balance, judicious tempi and an absence of unwanted accent or distortion. Conductor Sam Allchurch. Credit: Robert Catto The striking opening chords that begin the Mass were sung with an unforced, open sound, allowing pure vowels and the music\u2019s harmonic richness to convey the necessary emphasis. The ensuing expansive five-part Kyrie fugue flowed with a deeply embedded, unhurried pulse. For the Christe, soprano Sara Macliver and alto Sally-Anne Russell created a nicely edged duet sound and their pealing imitation in the second theme was like the playful eddies of running water. For the second Kyrie, the choir returned with a tone of measured seriousness. The choruses of the Gloria and the addition of a brilliant battery of three trumpets require, of course, more animation, but Allchurch\u2019s broad metric direction ensured the music was emblematic of joy rather than over-excitement.\n\nConcertmaster Matthew Greco led with light precision, aptly demonstrated in the nimbleness of his and Macliver\u2019s ornamentation in Laudamus te. Illustrating the two-in-one theme implicit in the text of the Domine Deus section, flute players Melissa Farrow and Mikaela Oberg wove threads of silvery filigree against Macliver and tenor Andrew Goodwin, the latter singing with smoothly tanned finish and blooming projection. Russell sang the Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris aria with full sound and rich colour, memorably bringing the same qualities to the darker depths of the penultimate Agnus Dei just before the final chorus. Bass David Greco enlivened the Quoniam and Et in Spiritum Sanctum arias with pointed, elastic articulation that accentuated the natural rhythmic emphasis of the complex melodic line. While the orchestra retuned after the Credo, Allchurch regrouped the chorus to facilitate the double-choir format Bach uses for the Osanna. The regrouping also highlighted the broad antiphonal strokes of the Sanctus, which swayed majestically like great tolling bells and gave the music of the Donna nobis pacem (which had been heard earlier in the Gratias agimus fugue with the former grouping) a more focused, brilliant finish. When performed as well as it was here, Bach\u2019s Mass inevitably creates a sense of awe and wonder at the extent of human imagination and craft. What better way for Sydney Chamber Choir to end its 50th anniversary season.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSam Fender\n\nShowring, Entertainment Quarter, November 21\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 In 2019, British singer-songwriter Sam Fender played his debut Sydney show at the 500-capacity Oxford Art Factory. Fast-forward six years \u2013 during which he\u2019s amassed three UK No.1 albums, a Mercury Music Prize for this year\u2019s People Watching LP and, in June, a sold-out show at the 80,000 capacity London Stadium \u2013 and his star has risen significantly. Among the 15,000 people flowing through the gates of the Showring, the constant stream of Newcastle United shirts suggests his expat appeal remains strong. However, when the North Shields-born artist asks how many in the crowd are British and how many are Australians, the loudest cheer comes from the locals, affirmation that his songs of everyday life and blue-collar tribulation have resonance beyond his home country.\n\nSam Fender\u2019s star has risen significantly. Credit: Georgia Griffiths On this night, those songs sound majestic. That Fender opens his biggest-ever Sydney show not with a mainstream hit but the deep cut Angel in Lothian suggests this is a man not tied to the staid old traditions of arena rock but one who has faith in his material and his band to make it a convincing opener. His backing group has swelled to a seven-piece over the years, a younger, northern English answer to Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band, and they look like they\u2019re having the collective time of their life. That they can pull off the howling noise-punk rock of Howdon Aldi Death Queue \u2013 introduced by Fender as a \u201cstupid song\u201d, and arguably the only set-list misstep of the evening \u2013 and follow it with a track as nuanced and elegant as Spit of You is a byproduct not only of the hundreds of shows they\u2019ve played together but their history as friends stretching back to their teenage years.",

        "text": "When the sanctions were unveiled, the Brent crude oil price was about $US66 a barrel, with that of Russia\u2019s flagship product, Urals crude, trading at about $US57.5 a barrel. Last week, with the Brent price about $US65 a barrel, the Urals price sank as low as $US36.61 a barrel. Loading Reuters has reported that Russia\u2019s revenues from oil and gas this month may be 35 per cent lower than they were a year ago. If sustained and effectively policed, the sanctions will undermine Russia\u2019s ability to prosecute the war effectively \u2013 and potentially cause deeper economic pain and breed social unrest in the regions outside Moscow and other military centres, where the war efforts are centred. None of this will matter, of course, if the latest attempt to wrangle a peace deal \u2013 one that is likely to be tilted towards Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands \u2013 is successful. It would be inevitable that all sanctions on Russia would be lifted as part of any deal.\n\nEqually, an even more potent set of proposed bipartisan sanctions that has been sitting in the US Congress since April might never be enacted. The latter sanctions, which include tariffs on countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian petroleum products and/or uranium of 500 per cent of the value of the transactions, have been held up in Congress while Trump has pursued his peace deal. Trump has said he will sign the bill if the latest peace talks fail. Oil silos on the Russkoye heavy crude oil field, operated by Rosneft \u2013 one of Russia\u2019s two main producers \u2013 in East Siberia. Credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images The US sanctions represented a significant change in the West\u2019s response to the invasion, targeting end-customers rather than just the price of Russia\u2019s oil. Until then, the G-7 had imposed a $US60-a-barrel price cap on Russia\u2019s oil exports, buttressed by sanctions targeting the financing and insurance of the transporting of Russia\u2019s oil exports. Russia was able, to a large degree, to circumvent those sanctions by acquiring its own shadow fleet of tankers and providing its own insurance arrangements.\n\nThe G-7 targeted the price, rather than the flow, of Russia\u2019s oil because the West was concerned that any interruption to Russian supply \u2013 nearly 10 per cent of global supply in 2022 \u2013 would create another oil shock, sending prices rocketing and causing economic distress when, emerging from the pandemic, economies around the world were still weak and suffering from the big spike in inflation generated by the pandemic\u2019s impact on global supply chains. Loading The intent of those sanctions was to use the price cap to reduce the revenue Russia received from its oil and gas sales without choking off the flow \u2013 the cap was set at a level that left an incentive for Russia to keep producing and selling its oil. At the time, indeed until relatively recently, the OPEC+ cartel had been keeping oil supplies tight, having withdrawn about 6 million barrels a day of production capacity from the market. In the months after the invasion, before the price cap was introduced, the oil price soared to more than $US120 a barrel. Since then, China and India have absolutely gorged on Russia\u2019s discounted oil. Before the sanctions, India, the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer, imported about 2.5 per cent of its oil from Russia. In the past financial year, that percentage was almost 36 per cent.\n\nWhile there might be a stigma associated with any purchase of Russia\u2019s oil \u2013 the \u201cBlood Oil\u201d series this masthead has been running says that there is \u2013 the intent of the original sanctions was to keep Russia\u2019s oil flowing to the rest of the world, which they did. It\u2019s interesting that China, India and Turkey (all with strong relationships with Russia) were the major beneficiaries \u2013 but the sanctions\u2019 deliberate focus on price rather than flow makes it difficult to be overly critical of them rather than of those who designed the regime that encouraged their purchases. That, of course, changes now that the new US sanctions are in place. This year, OPEC abandoned its efforts to ration supply, returning more than 2 million barrels a day to the market.\n\nSupply now exceeds demand, the price has trended down from more than $US80 a barrel early in the year to about $US63 a barrel, and there is now a glut of oil within the market that looks like continuing well into next year. Loading It\u2019s that glut which enables the US to try to throttle Russia\u2019s oil sales without a fear of massive price impacts. There\u2019s also still a lot of OPEC capacity \u2013 particularly Saudi capacity \u2013 on the sidelines that could be brought back if required to keep prices under control. Trump and his family are, of course, close to the Saudis. Had the US been prepared to wield the big sticks in its sanctions\u2019 armoury, targeted Russia\u2019s customers earlier and backed the sanctions with enforcement, the West\u2019s sanctions would have been far more effective and Russia\u2019s capacity to fund the war could have been severely constrained.",

        "text": "Loading Thanks largely to Harry Brook (52) and Jamie Smith (33), England dragged themselves to 172. Starc finished with seven, swinging the ball late and relentlessly targeting the danger area. It was swing bowling as high art. England\u2019s reply with the ball hinted at what might have been. Mark Wood and Jofra Archer touched 150 kph and rattled the top order. Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne were repeatedly struck on the gloves and body, their footwork leaden. Stokes, bowling with fire and scant regard for length, claimed five wickets. Australia finished the day looking groggy at 9-123. What followed on the second day turned the game, and possibly the series, on its head \u2013 literally. Crawley again departed early to a brilliantly athletic caught-and-bowled by Starc, then Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope set about steadying the ship. A lead of 250-plus appeared all England required, but Starc and a much-improved Scott Boland, well-supported by Brendan Doggett, reeled the tourists in. Three wickets from Boland mid-morning took England from 1-65 to 4-76 and ripped them apart. It soon became 5-76 when Starc had Joe Root chopping on.\n\nEngland\u2019s second innings lasted a mere 34 overs, meaning they faced only 66 overs in the match. Starc and Boland found the perfect length \u2013 just short of driving length on a surface offering pronounced bounce \u2013 and England\u2019s top order froze. The initial trigger movement that has become a hallmark of the Bazball era \u2013 a pronounced shift back and across the stumps before settling into another static position \u2013 left batsmen playing with hands alone. On a pitch this quick, that is terminal. Mitchell Starc was superb in the first Test in Perth. Credit: Seven Root, Harry Brook, and the rest fell into the trap. Brook, in particular, looked a shadow of the player who has been compared to a young Sachin Tendulkar. Seduced by the team\u2019s ballistic blueprint, he abandoned the minimal-footwork of playing angles method that once made him unstoppable. The result: another loose drive, another edge, another wasted opportunity for a player who could yet be England\u2019s next great batsman.\n\nEngland\u2019s bowlers returned for a second bite and looked strangely spent. Archer managed only short bursts, Wood sprayed it, and Atkinson was impotent. The tactical acumen that had been so praised in home conditions evaporated. Australia\u2019s left-handers, Travis Head and Jake Weatherald, tamed an attack that lost the plot. What followed was one of the great counter-attacking Ashes innings since Adam Gilchrist\u2019s 57-ball century at the WACA in 2006. Head demanded the opportunity to take England on, walked in with the Perth wind at his back, and played the sort of knock England thought only they were allowed to. England captain Ben Stokes speaks with Joe Root and Harry Brook in Perth. Credit: Getty Images Driving, pulling, cutting \u2013 he taunted them with his version of their invention. He turned a precarious position into a match-defining 123 from a mere 83 balls, ably supported by Weatherald and Labuschagne. By the end, the bowlers and the captain were bereft of ideas and hope.\n\nThis was not just a defeat; it was a public dismantling. From one of the most fancied England sides to visit these shores this century to the subject of future Australian bar-room mirth within 24 hours. The captain, Stokes, cut a forlorn figure, short on options and visibly drained. Coach Brendon McCullum faces the hardest question of his tenure: does he double down on the doctrine that brought 13 wins from 19 Tests at home, or does he demand a recalibration for the conditions? Individual reckonings are equally stark. Crawley\u2019s technique, often profitable on flatter English decks, has been brutally exposed. Zak Crawley made a pair of ducks in Perth. Credit: Getty Images Brook stands at a crossroads: continue the feast-or-famine approach and risk becoming a supporting player \u2013 flashes of genius amid prolonged disappointment \u2013 or rediscover the disciplined aggression that once made him the most exciting young batsman in cricket.\n\nRoot, possibly playing his final Ashes series in Australia, must address the early movements that leave him vulnerable to the moving ball. Loading Yet for all the recriminations, this encounter was compelling theatre. Two days of unrelenting intensity, 673 runs, 32 wickets, and barely a dull moment. Head demonstrated that aggression and common sense need not be mutually exclusive; Starc reminded everyone he remains the most dangerous left-arm quick on the planet when in this form. In Perth, Australia boasted the best bowler, the best batter, the best captain and, arguably, the best game plan. The Australian selectors now have options that will make the side stronger.",

The team might also feel that it would give validation to the incorrect and ugly narrative that they have been favouring Norris all season.\n\nYet after McLaren\u2019s double disqualification at the Las Vegas Grand Prix , combined with Verstappen\u2019s rapid resurgence, they are now at risk of losing out on a first drivers\u2019 title in 17 years to the brilliant Verstappen. To have the best chance of ending the Red Bull driver\u2019s hopes, they must now favour Norris and sacrifice Piastri.\n\nSo vast was their advantage in performance that Max Verstappen was 97 points behind Piastri and 86 behind Norris after the Hungarian Grand Prix in August.\n\nMcLaren have spent the 2025 season aiming for total fairness between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri . At times, it has made them look silly and inflexible . It was, though, merely an intriguing subplot at a time when one of their drivers seemed destined to claim a maiden title.\n\nBut too many times McLaren have become entangled in their philosophy to their own detriment. They must avoid it costing them a title. For all that the constructors\u2019 championship brings the money, the drivers\u2019 title brings the prestige.\n\nDo McLaren have to make this decision now? There is a chance that, without intervention, Norris finishes far enough ahead of his rivals in Qatar that he eliminates one or both of them from contention, or that it leaves him needing to score just a handful of points in Abu Dhabi to claim the title. That way they avoid both an awkward conversation with Piastri and any turbulence in the team.\n\nYet with just two rounds left, including a sprint race (this weekend in Qatar), errors from driver or team in any number of areas could have a disproportionate effect on McLaren\u2019s hopes. For McLaren to maximise their chances of winning the drivers\u2019 title they need Piastri to work for his team-mate as soon as possible. Norris is the man with the points advantage, Verstappen is the one with the momentum. The out-of-form Piastri, sadly, should be what gives.\n\nA combination of factors justify such a decision. Firstly, 24 points is a decent but not enormous lead with 58 available. As it stands, Norris could lose the title to Verstappen without any disastrous results or non-finishes. If the Dutchman wins the sprint and two grands prix and Norris finishes third in all of them, then the Briton will squeak through by just two points. That shows how tight it is. This margin is put into sharper focus by the direction of travel. Earlier in the season, Verstappen won the odd race and would generally finish behind both McLarens. How that has changed.",

        "text": "But it\u2019s our fault, right? We keep buying these edible substances despite health nags telling us they are making us overweight and sick. Half of our energy intake in Australia comes from UPFs, mostly in the form of ready meals, packaged bread, cereals and soft drinks. Less than five per cent of us eat enough fruit and vegetables. If only we exercised a little more willpower and made better choices in our lives, two-thirds of our country wouldn\u2019t be obese or overweight. And we wouldn\u2019t be weighing down the hospital system with cases of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, Crohn\u2019s disease and depression. Except we\u2019re a convenient scapegoat. If consumers are the problem then corporations can go on their merry way, creating products that are, from an evolutionary perspective, entirely foreign to our bodies and causing them harm.\n\nDeflecting blame is just one strategy food companies use. Today, three of the biggest food corporations (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Mondelez) spend $13.5 billion on advertising every year, four times the entire operating budget of the World Health Organisation. And a surprising amount of thought and effort goes into designing foods that keep our confused bodies craving more as they seek nourishment from non-existent nutrients. All the flavour profiles that our bodies instinctively associate with various nutrients are there. Only it\u2019s a sensory illusion. That UPFs are also often soft, are hyper-palatable, and never satiate us makes overeating easy, adds Deakin University\u2019s Dr Priscila Machado.\n\nLoading \u201cWe designed food to be irresistible. Now we\u2019re taking medicine to resist it,\u201d futurist and author Mike Lee writes. As the industry has grown, and our waists have grown alongside it, industry leaders envision capturing more than just market share. They want to capture our diets, our stomach, and mouth share too. To illustrate this idea, the authors of the new three-part Lancet series on Ultra-Processed Foods and Human Health, give this example: \u201cIn 1986, Roberto Goizueta, then president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola, outlined his vision to investors:\n\n\u201c\u2018Right now in the [USA], people consume more soft drinks than any other liquid, including ordinary tap water. If we take full advantage of our opportunities \u2026 we will see the same wave catching on in market after market until, eventually, the number one beverage on earth will be ... soft drinks \u2013 our soft drinks.\u2019\u201d The Lancet series highlights that interest groups funded by leading corporations also work relentlessly to block regulation and create conditions that allow them to expand. In 2024, of the 326 lobbyists employed by the US food and beverage industry, 211 were former government employees; Australia\u2019s Health Star Ratings system, developed in partnership with industry, gives many UPFs high ratings, suggesting that it has been co-opted as a marketing tool; while systematic reviews on soft drinks and obesity risk were five times more likely to show no association with obesity if industry-sponsored. All this is to say, the problem is not you or us. It\u2019s them. \u201cFor a long time the problem has been framed as a matter of individual responsibility,\u201d said Phillip Baker, an author in the Lancet series.\n\n\u201cWe offer an alternative interpretation of the problem, describing the root causes as the rising power of the UPF industry to shape food systems in ways that generate ultra-processed diets.\u201d We can, of course, try our best to avoid UPFs in their shiny plastic packaging and with ingredients we wouldn\u2019t use at home. But it misses the point that it is the food industry that has become bloated \u2013 obese, even \u2013 with greed. The 43 global experts, including Australians, have ideas about how to fix the food environment we find ourselves in. They include marketing restrictions; sugar and UPF taxes; restricting the available foods in retail spaces; and improving school food policies. In Brazil, for example, the limit of processed and ultra-processed foods on public school menus is 15 per cent. All other food has to come from small-to-medium enterprises. Any change also involves recognising that most households struggle with time and resources to make healthy meals and that women, many of whom are working, tend to bear the burden of the care work in the home, including meal preparation.",

And if kids get onto those pathways early enough and well enough, we can keep them off the pathway that leads to child protection, youth justice and the need for significant investment from governments to intervene late.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearing in tandem to many of the issues identified in the report is the finding that one in five young adults are experiencing high levels of psychological distress.\n\n\n\n\n\nAshwini says that watching daily news plays a big part in that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is quite distressing, right, and sometimes it kind of feels out of your hands, like you're unable to fix it as well, especially when you are a young person and under 18 especially. The school has been great in supporting us and also in telling guys during the exam periods, don't read the news too much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in Parliament on Monday, the report put forward five recommendations - including establishing a National Early Childhood Commission.\n\n\n\nBut for Ashwini, giving young people a seat at the table is the recommendation that stands out\n\n\n\n",

Construction sector insolvencies, rising material costs and changing preferences for larger homes and smaller household sizes didn't help.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result was a mismatch of more than one million new households formed in the past five years compared with 880,000 new dwellings completed, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs property prices have risen, homeowners and investors have been able to reinvest their massive capital gains back into the housing market, widening the gap for first-home buyers and those without parental assistance to enter the market.\n\n\n\n\"There's been this extraordinary separation between property prices and income,\" Owen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It definitely speaks to a widening in the divide of the haves and have-nots when it comes to the property market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sydney's eastern suburbs, it would take 35 years for an average wage earner to save up a 20 per cent deposit for a median-priced house.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if they somehow cleared that hurdle, servicing the mortgage would take up one-and-a-half times their income.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, increased taxes on investment properties in Melbourne have kept home values structurally lower across the city, with the median dwelling value 7.1 times higher than income, compared with a multiple of 10 in Sydney.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "New national guidelines to help clinicians manage male infertility will improve care and support for men facing fertility challenges, experts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile only eight to nine per cent of men experience infertility, male factors contribute to half of all infertility cases, and in 20 to 30 per cent of cases, male infertility is the sole barrier to pregnancy worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidelines, published in the Medical Journal of Australia, outline key steps in evaluating male fertility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include taking a detailed reproductive and medical history, conducting a physical examination, performing semen analysis, and coordinating assessment with the female partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped by an international panel of experts from universities and health clinics, the guidelines were adapted from European and United States recommendations to suit the Australian context.\n\n\n\nLiza O'Donnell, a panel member and a senior research scientist from Griffith University, specialising in reproductive health, said the guidelines were tailored to reflect current clinical practice, including routine tests and services available under Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was really adapting it [guidelines] to what clinicians encounter when they're in their office and when a man comes to see them,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nGuidelines shift the focus from women to men\n\nO'Donnell said the guidelines would \"really\" impact the narrative that \"infertility is a women's issue\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In fact, that's one of the biggest things that's coming out about these guidelines,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first recommendations states both men and women with suspected infertility should be examined simultaneously, though not necessarily by the same doctor.\n\n\n\n\"It's often the woman [who] goes to the doctor, gets a lot of tests done, and then at the end, when they can't find anything wrong with her, someone thinks to check the man, and he doesn't have any sperm,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So that woman has been subjected to a lot of unnecessary testing and delays in finding the cause of the couple's infertility.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Donnell said the guidelines would ensure men with fertility issues are up much earlier in the screening process and that could potentially change the treatment course for affected couples.\n\n\n\nFactors affecting male infertility\n\nO'Donnell said there are factors that contribute to lower sperm count in men.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than not maintaining a healthy lifestyle or weight, sperm production lowers when the testes are not two degrees lower than the rest of the body.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recommends wearing loose-fitting clothing, avoiding prolonged sitting in saunas, and not placing laptops directly on the lap to help maintain optimal testicular temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also notes paternal age plays a role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Similar to older women, men over the age of 40 have an increased risk of having children with certain genetic disorders.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's website redesign now carries a hefty price tag of $96 million dollars - significantly exceeding previous cost estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency quickly apologised last month after the new site drew criticism from both the public and politicians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau responded by making changes to help users locate familiar functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the BoM's new chief executive, Dr Stuart Minchin, revealed that the website cost significantly more than the previously stated $4.1 million dollar revamp.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Environment Minister, Murray Watt, told the ABC that he was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the cost blowout and that it was Dr Minchin's job to get on top of the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the BOM has got some explaining to do about that. We do have a new CEO of the BOM who only started two weeks ago after this all occurred. I met with him on his very first day. I've met with him since. So twice in his first fortnight. And made very clear to him that I want him to get on top of the issues around the website, not just continue making changes to make it more usable, but get on top of how we got to this situation in the first place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Minchin says the massive sum covers the extensive rebuilding and testing of the secure, data intensive systems supporting the website.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost breakdown includes $4.1 million for the redesign, $79.8 million for the website build, and $12.6 million for the site's launch and security testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Watt says that he is happy that the Bureau took the redesign process seriously, but is deeply concerned with how the Bureau is positioning the costing of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he is waiting to hear back from Mr Minchin before calling the website a \"sheer waste of money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the BOM had said to me was that there were other elements of the website design that did increase the costs. I don't think that I was aware of that total cost of $96 million. I certainly knew that it was more than four, and my recollection is that there were media reports at the time that said that the $4 million related to just the website design, but there was a lot of back-of-house activity that had costed more. But I understand that people are very concerned about that amount of money, and that's why I've asked the new CEO to get on top of what occurred.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals Leader David Littleproud says there is a cultural problem within the Bureau that needs to be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have a business model of fail and ask the taxpayer for more money. We've seen that over the last couple of years. They told everybody, every farmer, that there was going to be a catastrophic El Nino event. Farmers went off, sold all their livestock, lightened. It flooded The market. Dropped, the price. Lo and behold, it continued to rain, and they couldn't afford to get back into the market. I've seen cyclones in North Queensland where they forgot to warn people that after the cyclone might be a rain depression. And we've seen floods where people haven't been prepared.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Littleproud is concerned the cost of the website will create a lack of trust in the Bureau of Meteorology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Someone's having a lend of the Australian taxpayer. The BoM's been complicit in allowing this to happen, and there needs to be a consequence. You will not change culture in the Bureau of Meteorology unless there is a consequence and the minister has been silent on this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearing on Channel Seven, Minister for Social Services Tanya Plibersek was asked how she could justify the government's decision to spend the GDP of a small island nation on one website.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that under the previous CEO, the website was vulnerable to attacks, creating an unsafe situation for Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Plibersek acknowledges, however, that the final cost presents a serious problem.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Every November, Black Friday arrives with big claims of massive savings and \"one-day-only\" deals. We are bombarded with offers that seem too good to pass up. But beneath all this lies something far more strategic.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Friday is not simply about a day (now more than a fortnight) of discounts. It\u2019s also a psychological event, carefully designed to take advantage of how our brains make decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding some of the science behind this process can help us recognise when we are being pushed to spend more than we intended.\n\n\n\nQuick, quick, spend up big\n\nWhen we decide between options, such as whether to buy a new TV, our brains weigh up bits of evidence for and against each choice. We compare prices, features, reviews and what we can afford. Once we feel we have enough information, we decide.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally this process takes time. The more important the decision, the more evidence we like to gather.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when we are put under pressure, that changes. The brain lowers the threshold for how much information it needs before deciding. In other words, time pressure makes us decide faster and with less evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be useful when acting quickly matters. If a spider lands on your arm, you do not calmly evaluate the pros and cons before flicking it off.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut during Black Friday sales, that same quick-decision process can lead us to spend impulsively.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The simple shopping swap that could save you $4,000 a year\n\nOMG, they\u2019re almost sold out\n\nAs well as tapping into \"urgency\", Black Friday sales tap into \"scarcity\". We know the sale lasts only a short time, and many people are shopping at once. This creates a strong feeling of competition: if we do not act quickly, we will miss out.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we\u2019re browsing for a TV, the website says there are \"only 8 left in stock\", and \"12 people have this item in their carts\". Suddenly, it feels like a race. Even if you were not planning to buy right away, you might feel more compelled to \"add to cart\" before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sense of scarcity changes how our brain processes information. When we believe something is in limited supply, we assign it more value, telling us the item must be good simply because others have it in their basket too.\n\n\n\nWhat was I thinking?\n\nWhen we make decisions quickly, we rely on less evidence and are more likely to make mistakes, a long-known psychological phenomenon called the speed-accuracy trade-off.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder time pressure, our brain tries to find shortcuts to help evaluate options, such as how many people are viewing an item. But this may be less useful information than details such as warranty, product quality or long-term value.\n\n\n\n\n\nSignalling that something is scarce can also discourage us from looking for more information. If it seems like a product might sell out, taking the time to compare prices or read reviews feels risky. The product could disappear while we\u2019re still thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur brains prefer predictable outcomes and try to avoid unnecessary risk, so instead of getting more information, we act quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFast decisions are not always a bad thing. Acting quickly can save time or prevent harm when we do not have complete information. This could include evacuating when the fire alarm goes off, even if you are not sure if there is an actual fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut during Black Friday, retailers create artificial urgency. Timers, \"limited stock\" alerts and \"today only\" banners are designed to mimic real scarcity, pushing our brains into decision-making overdrive.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that sense of urgency kicks in, rational thinking can take a back seat. We stop asking \"Do I really need this?\" and start thinking \"What if I miss out?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the type of thinking that sees you buy a new TV that is only slightly better than the one you have.\n\n\n\nBlack Friday feels like a celebration of savings, but it is also a masterclass in behavioural and brain science. Every timer, pop-up and \"only 3 left\" alert is carefully crafted to grab your attention, and shorten your decision time.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing how these tactics work can help you stay in control.\n\n\n\n4 tips to stay in control:\n\nPlan before the pressure hits \u2014 research what you really need and obtain more information before the sales season. This will help when the brain has to make decisions under time pressure.\n\nSet a budget and keep it visible \u2014 decide how much you are willing to spend and remind yourself while shopping. This helps counteract the \"scarcity effect\", reminding your brain that other limits also exist.\n\nPause before you purchase \u2014 when you feel the pressure, take a minute. A break lets your brain catch up with the excitement.\n\nAsk yourself \"Would I want this at full price?\" This helps your brain focus on the actual value of the item.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with enjoying a good deal. But when you find yourself in the middle of all the excitement, it is worth remembering what is happening inside your brain, and who truly benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nTijl Grootswagers receives funding from the Australian Research Council.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Clay Crighton (previously on piano and violin, who also contributed original music and lyrics) is a second-act show-stealer as Charley Parkhurst, a hilarious drag caricature of a rival outlaw. His entrance interrupts a long and scattered argument between the townsfolk about new and old values. The most conservative voice is then conveniently shot by dainty hand, and his death promptly passed over by a hammy, action-packed shoot-out. Lord knows the messages of Cowbois are important in a backsliding world. But this desperado could do with more fire in the belly, their steed a swift kick with sharp spurs. MUSIC\n\nBach Mass in B minor\n\nSydney Chamber Choir\n\nCity Recital Hall, November 22\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd With his genius for contrapuntal combinations carrying deep musical and symbolic significance, Bach constructed the great four-part fugue, Donna Nobis Pacem, which concludes the Mass in B minor, so the pleas for peace pile harmoniously on top of one another, each beginning before the previous one has ceased and overreaching it (a \u201cstretto\u201d in musical terms) to create a sonic image of collective yearning.\n\nThe swelling sonority and translucent texture of the Sydney Chamber Choir and the Muffat Collective orchestra under Sam Allchurch in this number encapsulated all the virtues of the performance that it brought to such a glowing close: clarity, balance, judicious tempi and an absence of unwanted accent or distortion. Conductor Sam Allchurch. Credit: Robert Catto The striking opening chords that begin the Mass were sung with an unforced, open sound, allowing pure vowels and the music\u2019s harmonic richness to convey the necessary emphasis. The ensuing expansive five-part Kyrie fugue flowed with a deeply embedded, unhurried pulse. For the Christe, soprano Sara Macliver and alto Sally-Anne Russell created a nicely edged duet sound and their pealing imitation in the second theme was like the playful eddies of running water. For the second Kyrie, the choir returned with a tone of measured seriousness. The choruses of the Gloria and the addition of a brilliant battery of three trumpets require, of course, more animation, but Allchurch\u2019s broad metric direction ensured the music was emblematic of joy rather than over-excitement.\n\nConcertmaster Matthew Greco led with light precision, aptly demonstrated in the nimbleness of his and Macliver\u2019s ornamentation in Laudamus te. Illustrating the two-in-one theme implicit in the text of the Domine Deus section, flute players Melissa Farrow and Mikaela Oberg wove threads of silvery filigree against Macliver and tenor Andrew Goodwin, the latter singing with smoothly tanned finish and blooming projection. Russell sang the Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris aria with full sound and rich colour, memorably bringing the same qualities to the darker depths of the penultimate Agnus Dei just before the final chorus. Bass David Greco enlivened the Quoniam and Et in Spiritum Sanctum arias with pointed, elastic articulation that accentuated the natural rhythmic emphasis of the complex melodic line. While the orchestra retuned after the Credo, Allchurch regrouped the chorus to facilitate the double-choir format Bach uses for the Osanna. The regrouping also highlighted the broad antiphonal strokes of the Sanctus, which swayed majestically like great tolling bells and gave the music of the Donna nobis pacem (which had been heard earlier in the Gratias agimus fugue with the former grouping) a more focused, brilliant finish. When performed as well as it was here, Bach\u2019s Mass inevitably creates a sense of awe and wonder at the extent of human imagination and craft. What better way for Sydney Chamber Choir to end its 50th anniversary season.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSam Fender\n\nShowring, Entertainment Quarter, November 21\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 In 2019, British singer-songwriter Sam Fender played his debut Sydney show at the 500-capacity Oxford Art Factory. Fast-forward six years \u2013 during which he\u2019s amassed three UK No.1 albums, a Mercury Music Prize for this year\u2019s People Watching LP and, in June, a sold-out show at the 80,000 capacity London Stadium \u2013 and his star has risen significantly. Among the 15,000 people flowing through the gates of the Showring, the constant stream of Newcastle United shirts suggests his expat appeal remains strong. However, when the North Shields-born artist asks how many in the crowd are British and how many are Australians, the loudest cheer comes from the locals, affirmation that his songs of everyday life and blue-collar tribulation have resonance beyond his home country.\n\nSam Fender\u2019s star has risen significantly. Credit: Georgia Griffiths On this night, those songs sound majestic. That Fender opens his biggest-ever Sydney show not with a mainstream hit but the deep cut Angel in Lothian suggests this is a man not tied to the staid old traditions of arena rock but one who has faith in his material and his band to make it a convincing opener. His backing group has swelled to a seven-piece over the years, a younger, northern English answer to Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band, and they look like they\u2019re having the collective time of their life. That they can pull off the howling noise-punk rock of Howdon Aldi Death Queue \u2013 introduced by Fender as a \u201cstupid song\u201d, and arguably the only set-list misstep of the evening \u2013 and follow it with a track as nuanced and elegant as Spit of You is a byproduct not only of the hundreds of shows they\u2019ve played together but their history as friends stretching back to their teenage years.",

        "text": "When the sanctions were unveiled, the Brent crude oil price was about $US66 a barrel, with that of Russia\u2019s flagship product, Urals crude, trading at about $US57.5 a barrel. Last week, with the Brent price about $US65 a barrel, the Urals price sank as low as $US36.61 a barrel. Loading Reuters has reported that Russia\u2019s revenues from oil and gas this month may be 35 per cent lower than they were a year ago. If sustained and effectively policed, the sanctions will undermine Russia\u2019s ability to prosecute the war effectively \u2013 and potentially cause deeper economic pain and breed social unrest in the regions outside Moscow and other military centres, where the war efforts are centred. None of this will matter, of course, if the latest attempt to wrangle a peace deal \u2013 one that is likely to be tilted towards Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands \u2013 is successful. It would be inevitable that all sanctions on Russia would be lifted as part of any deal.\n\nEqually, an even more potent set of proposed bipartisan sanctions that has been sitting in the US Congress since April might never be enacted. The latter sanctions, which include tariffs on countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian petroleum products and/or uranium of 500 per cent of the value of the transactions, have been held up in Congress while Trump has pursued his peace deal. Trump has said he will sign the bill if the latest peace talks fail. Oil silos on the Russkoye heavy crude oil field, operated by Rosneft \u2013 one of Russia\u2019s two main producers \u2013 in East Siberia. Credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images The US sanctions represented a significant change in the West\u2019s response to the invasion, targeting end-customers rather than just the price of Russia\u2019s oil. Until then, the G-7 had imposed a $US60-a-barrel price cap on Russia\u2019s oil exports, buttressed by sanctions targeting the financing and insurance of the transporting of Russia\u2019s oil exports. Russia was able, to a large degree, to circumvent those sanctions by acquiring its own shadow fleet of tankers and providing its own insurance arrangements.\n\nThe G-7 targeted the price, rather than the flow, of Russia\u2019s oil because the West was concerned that any interruption to Russian supply \u2013 nearly 10 per cent of global supply in 2022 \u2013 would create another oil shock, sending prices rocketing and causing economic distress when, emerging from the pandemic, economies around the world were still weak and suffering from the big spike in inflation generated by the pandemic\u2019s impact on global supply chains. Loading The intent of those sanctions was to use the price cap to reduce the revenue Russia received from its oil and gas sales without choking off the flow \u2013 the cap was set at a level that left an incentive for Russia to keep producing and selling its oil. At the time, indeed until relatively recently, the OPEC+ cartel had been keeping oil supplies tight, having withdrawn about 6 million barrels a day of production capacity from the market. In the months after the invasion, before the price cap was introduced, the oil price soared to more than $US120 a barrel. Since then, China and India have absolutely gorged on Russia\u2019s discounted oil. Before the sanctions, India, the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer, imported about 2.5 per cent of its oil from Russia. In the past financial year, that percentage was almost 36 per cent.\n\nWhile there might be a stigma associated with any purchase of Russia\u2019s oil \u2013 the \u201cBlood Oil\u201d series this masthead has been running says that there is \u2013 the intent of the original sanctions was to keep Russia\u2019s oil flowing to the rest of the world, which they did. It\u2019s interesting that China, India and Turkey (all with strong relationships with Russia) were the major beneficiaries \u2013 but the sanctions\u2019 deliberate focus on price rather than flow makes it difficult to be overly critical of them rather than of those who designed the regime that encouraged their purchases. That, of course, changes now that the new US sanctions are in place. This year, OPEC abandoned its efforts to ration supply, returning more than 2 million barrels a day to the market.\n\nSupply now exceeds demand, the price has trended down from more than $US80 a barrel early in the year to about $US63 a barrel, and there is now a glut of oil within the market that looks like continuing well into next year. Loading It\u2019s that glut which enables the US to try to throttle Russia\u2019s oil sales without a fear of massive price impacts. There\u2019s also still a lot of OPEC capacity \u2013 particularly Saudi capacity \u2013 on the sidelines that could be brought back if required to keep prices under control. Trump and his family are, of course, close to the Saudis. Had the US been prepared to wield the big sticks in its sanctions\u2019 armoury, targeted Russia\u2019s customers earlier and backed the sanctions with enforcement, the West\u2019s sanctions would have been far more effective and Russia\u2019s capacity to fund the war could have been severely constrained.",

        "text": "Loading Thanks largely to Harry Brook (52) and Jamie Smith (33), England dragged themselves to 172. Starc finished with seven, swinging the ball late and relentlessly targeting the danger area. It was swing bowling as high art. England\u2019s reply with the ball hinted at what might have been. Mark Wood and Jofra Archer touched 150 kph and rattled the top order. Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne were repeatedly struck on the gloves and body, their footwork leaden. Stokes, bowling with fire and scant regard for length, claimed five wickets. Australia finished the day looking groggy at 9-123. What followed on the second day turned the game, and possibly the series, on its head \u2013 literally. Crawley again departed early to a brilliantly athletic caught-and-bowled by Starc, then Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope set about steadying the ship. A lead of 250-plus appeared all England required, but Starc and a much-improved Scott Boland, well-supported by Brendan Doggett, reeled the tourists in. Three wickets from Boland mid-morning took England from 1-65 to 4-76 and ripped them apart. It soon became 5-76 when Starc had Joe Root chopping on.\n\nEngland\u2019s second innings lasted a mere 34 overs, meaning they faced only 66 overs in the match. Starc and Boland found the perfect length \u2013 just short of driving length on a surface offering pronounced bounce \u2013 and England\u2019s top order froze. The initial trigger movement that has become a hallmark of the Bazball era \u2013 a pronounced shift back and across the stumps before settling into another static position \u2013 left batsmen playing with hands alone. On a pitch this quick, that is terminal. Mitchell Starc was superb in the first Test in Perth. Credit: Seven Root, Harry Brook, and the rest fell into the trap. Brook, in particular, looked a shadow of the player who has been compared to a young Sachin Tendulkar. Seduced by the team\u2019s ballistic blueprint, he abandoned the minimal-footwork of playing angles method that once made him unstoppable. The result: another loose drive, another edge, another wasted opportunity for a player who could yet be England\u2019s next great batsman.\n\nEngland\u2019s bowlers returned for a second bite and looked strangely spent. Archer managed only short bursts, Wood sprayed it, and Atkinson was impotent. The tactical acumen that had been so praised in home conditions evaporated. Australia\u2019s left-handers, Travis Head and Jake Weatherald, tamed an attack that lost the plot. What followed was one of the great counter-attacking Ashes innings since Adam Gilchrist\u2019s 57-ball century at the WACA in 2006. Head demanded the opportunity to take England on, walked in with the Perth wind at his back, and played the sort of knock England thought only they were allowed to. England captain Ben Stokes speaks with Joe Root and Harry Brook in Perth. Credit: Getty Images Driving, pulling, cutting \u2013 he taunted them with his version of their invention. He turned a precarious position into a match-defining 123 from a mere 83 balls, ably supported by Weatherald and Labuschagne. By the end, the bowlers and the captain were bereft of ideas and hope.\n\nThis was not just a defeat; it was a public dismantling. From one of the most fancied England sides to visit these shores this century to the subject of future Australian bar-room mirth within 24 hours. The captain, Stokes, cut a forlorn figure, short on options and visibly drained. Coach Brendon McCullum faces the hardest question of his tenure: does he double down on the doctrine that brought 13 wins from 19 Tests at home, or does he demand a recalibration for the conditions? Individual reckonings are equally stark. Crawley\u2019s technique, often profitable on flatter English decks, has been brutally exposed. Zak Crawley made a pair of ducks in Perth. Credit: Getty Images Brook stands at a crossroads: continue the feast-or-famine approach and risk becoming a supporting player \u2013 flashes of genius amid prolonged disappointment \u2013 or rediscover the disciplined aggression that once made him the most exciting young batsman in cricket.\n\nRoot, possibly playing his final Ashes series in Australia, must address the early movements that leave him vulnerable to the moving ball. Loading Yet for all the recriminations, this encounter was compelling theatre. Two days of unrelenting intensity, 673 runs, 32 wickets, and barely a dull moment. Head demonstrated that aggression and common sense need not be mutually exclusive; Starc reminded everyone he remains the most dangerous left-arm quick on the planet when in this form. In Perth, Australia boasted the best bowler, the best batter, the best captain and, arguably, the best game plan. The Australian selectors now have options that will make the side stronger.",

The team might also feel that it would give validation to the incorrect and ugly narrative that they have been favouring Norris all season.\n\nYet after McLaren\u2019s double disqualification at the Las Vegas Grand Prix , combined with Verstappen\u2019s rapid resurgence, they are now at risk of losing out on a first drivers\u2019 title in 17 years to the brilliant Verstappen. To have the best chance of ending the Red Bull driver\u2019s hopes, they must now favour Norris and sacrifice Piastri.\n\nSo vast was their advantage in performance that Max Verstappen was 97 points behind Piastri and 86 behind Norris after the Hungarian Grand Prix in August.\n\nMcLaren have spent the 2025 season aiming for total fairness between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri . At times, it has made them look silly and inflexible . It was, though, merely an intriguing subplot at a time when one of their drivers seemed destined to claim a maiden title.\n\nBut too many times McLaren have become entangled in their philosophy to their own detriment. They must avoid it costing them a title. For all that the constructors\u2019 championship brings the money, the drivers\u2019 title brings the prestige.\n\nDo McLaren have to make this decision now? There is a chance that, without intervention, Norris finishes far enough ahead of his rivals in Qatar that he eliminates one or both of them from contention, or that it leaves him needing to score just a handful of points in Abu Dhabi to claim the title. That way they avoid both an awkward conversation with Piastri and any turbulence in the team.\n\nYet with just two rounds left, including a sprint race (this weekend in Qatar), errors from driver or team in any number of areas could have a disproportionate effect on McLaren\u2019s hopes. For McLaren to maximise their chances of winning the drivers\u2019 title they need Piastri to work for his team-mate as soon as possible. Norris is the man with the points advantage, Verstappen is the one with the momentum. The out-of-form Piastri, sadly, should be what gives.\n\nA combination of factors justify such a decision. Firstly, 24 points is a decent but not enormous lead with 58 available. As it stands, Norris could lose the title to Verstappen without any disastrous results or non-finishes. If the Dutchman wins the sprint and two grands prix and Norris finishes third in all of them, then the Briton will squeak through by just two points. That shows how tight it is. This margin is put into sharper focus by the direction of travel. Earlier in the season, Verstappen won the odd race and would generally finish behind both McLarens. How that has changed.",

        "text": "But it\u2019s our fault, right? We keep buying these edible substances despite health nags telling us they are making us overweight and sick. Half of our energy intake in Australia comes from UPFs, mostly in the form of ready meals, packaged bread, cereals and soft drinks. Less than five per cent of us eat enough fruit and vegetables. If only we exercised a little more willpower and made better choices in our lives, two-thirds of our country wouldn\u2019t be obese or overweight. And we wouldn\u2019t be weighing down the hospital system with cases of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, Crohn\u2019s disease and depression. Except we\u2019re a convenient scapegoat. If consumers are the problem then corporations can go on their merry way, creating products that are, from an evolutionary perspective, entirely foreign to our bodies and causing them harm.\n\nDeflecting blame is just one strategy food companies use. Today, three of the biggest food corporations (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Mondelez) spend $13.5 billion on advertising every year, four times the entire operating budget of the World Health Organisation. And a surprising amount of thought and effort goes into designing foods that keep our confused bodies craving more as they seek nourishment from non-existent nutrients. All the flavour profiles that our bodies instinctively associate with various nutrients are there. Only it\u2019s a sensory illusion. That UPFs are also often soft, are hyper-palatable, and never satiate us makes overeating easy, adds Deakin University\u2019s Dr Priscila Machado.\n\nLoading \u201cWe designed food to be irresistible. Now we\u2019re taking medicine to resist it,\u201d futurist and author Mike Lee writes. As the industry has grown, and our waists have grown alongside it, industry leaders envision capturing more than just market share. They want to capture our diets, our stomach, and mouth share too. To illustrate this idea, the authors of the new three-part Lancet series on Ultra-Processed Foods and Human Health, give this example: \u201cIn 1986, Roberto Goizueta, then president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola, outlined his vision to investors:\n\n\u201c\u2018Right now in the [USA], people consume more soft drinks than any other liquid, including ordinary tap water. If we take full advantage of our opportunities \u2026 we will see the same wave catching on in market after market until, eventually, the number one beverage on earth will be ... soft drinks \u2013 our soft drinks.\u2019\u201d The Lancet series highlights that interest groups funded by leading corporations also work relentlessly to block regulation and create conditions that allow them to expand. In 2024, of the 326 lobbyists employed by the US food and beverage industry, 211 were former government employees; Australia\u2019s Health Star Ratings system, developed in partnership with industry, gives many UPFs high ratings, suggesting that it has been co-opted as a marketing tool; while systematic reviews on soft drinks and obesity risk were five times more likely to show no association with obesity if industry-sponsored. All this is to say, the problem is not you or us. It\u2019s them. \u201cFor a long time the problem has been framed as a matter of individual responsibility,\u201d said Phillip Baker, an author in the Lancet series.\n\n\u201cWe offer an alternative interpretation of the problem, describing the root causes as the rising power of the UPF industry to shape food systems in ways that generate ultra-processed diets.\u201d We can, of course, try our best to avoid UPFs in their shiny plastic packaging and with ingredients we wouldn\u2019t use at home. But it misses the point that it is the food industry that has become bloated \u2013 obese, even \u2013 with greed. The 43 global experts, including Australians, have ideas about how to fix the food environment we find ourselves in. They include marketing restrictions; sugar and UPF taxes; restricting the available foods in retail spaces; and improving school food policies. In Brazil, for example, the limit of processed and ultra-processed foods on public school menus is 15 per cent. All other food has to come from small-to-medium enterprises. Any change also involves recognising that most households struggle with time and resources to make healthy meals and that women, many of whom are working, tend to bear the burden of the care work in the home, including meal preparation.",
