(AP)\n\nWhile the 20-year Treasury note usually garners less attention than the 10-year or 30-year notes, all eyes have been on investors' perception of Treasuries since Moody's last Friday downgraded US government debt.\n\nThe Treasury sold $US16 billion ($25 billion) worth of 20-year bonds, and the auction settled with a 20-year Treasury yield above 5 per cent, signalling investors are demanding higher rates to hold US debt. The auction settled with a high yield of 5.04 per cent compared with 4.83 per cent at the last 20-year auction, in February.\n\nThe weak demand for US Treasuries comes as Wall Street is already fretting over the potential for President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" tax bill to add to the deficit and put pressure on the federal debt burden at a time when there is heightened uncertainty about the safe-haven status of American assets.\n\nTreasury yields have pushed higher in recent days after Moody's announcement last week, which stripped the US of its last perfect credit rating. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Wednesday rose to 4.59 per cent to hit its highest level since February and the yield on the 30-year Treasury rose above 5 per cent to hit its highest level since 2023.\n\nUS market traders have been spooked by the downgrade to the US credit rating and concerns the national deficit will blow out further. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)\n\n\"Although Moody's decision to downgrade the US's sovereign credit rating on Friday from Aaa to Aa1 was unsurprising, it does add focus on the real issues at hand: the US's growing deficit and debt burden,\" Hughey said.\n\nHigher bond yields can also entice investors and pull them away from other assets, putting pressure on the stock market.\n\nStocks were lower on Wednesday morning as Republicans in Congress tried to advance Trump's tax bill.\n\nTrump-backing billionaires poised to lose nearly a trillion dollars in two days View Gallery\n\n\"Recent budget deliberations in Washington are not offering global investors much solace that these challenges are being incorporated into the decision-making process,\" Hughey said.\n\nThe ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced in the economy, was 123 per cent last year, up from 104 per cent in 2017, according to the Treasury Department.",

        "text": "Science has pretty well established that the brain isn't static; it changes and adapts throughout our lives in response to life events in a process called neuroplasticity .\n\nResearchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodelled significantly during the three Ps: puberty (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and perimenopause.\n\nAll three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mum-to-be who leaves her mobile phone in the fridge and can't remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can't focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes.\n\nPregnancy is one of the three Ps (puberty, pregnancy and perimenopause), a time when a person's brain undergoes physical changes due to hormones. (Getty via CNN)\n\nBut far from being laughable, these behavioural stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain.\n\nCognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain's organisation and functioning.\n\n\"The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,\" Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.\n\n\"At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,\" she said. \"I thought we've got to connect these two together and understand this more.\"\n\nPritschet even volunteered as a \"guinea pig\" during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the day-to-day changes in the brain .\n\nAround this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a snapshot approach , many questions were left unanswered.\n\n\"If there's a 3 to 5 per cent decrease in total grey matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?\" Pritschet asked. \"We're missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis.\n\n\" We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,\" she said. \"What does this trajectory look like over gestation?\"\n\nWomen can lose some grey matter during pregnancy, while the brain makes other connections. (Getty)\n\nTo find out, Pritschet and her team tracked the brain changes in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal Nature Neuroscience in September.\n\n\"We saw this reduction in grey matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,\" Pritschet explained. \"We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.\" (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of grey and white matter. Grey matter is where most of the brain's thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.)\n\n\"The inflection point was birth,\" Pritschet said. \"We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in grey matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not.\"\n\nPritschet said this \"choreographed dance between major features of our brain\" is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, the changes may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting.\n\n\"It's a fine-tuning of circuits,\" she explained. \"We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there's a lot of behavioural adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load.\n\n\"And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,\" Pritschet said.\n\nThis theory is supported by earlier work. \"The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume \u2014 that sort of reduction \u2014 correlated with various \u2026 maternal behaviours (such as bonding). Again, that's all correlation,\" she said.\n\n\"That's an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,\" she said. \"But you can expect that if there's fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioural process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you're going to have. That's the idea \u2014 but it's so much more complicated than that.\"\n\nW hat happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights.\n\nThe only constant is change\n\nThe body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval.\n\n\"Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person's life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,\" Pritschet said via email. \"But pregnancy doesn't just transform the body \u2014 it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development.\"\n\nShe called this remodelling an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman's adulthood.\n\nHow alarmed should women be?\n\nLess grey matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason.\n\n\"Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,\" Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. \"This change could indicate a 'fine-tuning' of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialised.\"\n\nThese changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, \"showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be.\"\n\nThese changes could affect future health and behaviour\n\nMapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioural outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behaviour.\n\n\"The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders \u2026 and individual differences in parental behaviour,\" said Pritschet.",

(Supplied)\n\n\"I'll just get around the corner for you mate\u2026 while we're dealing with the rain shower,\" he tells Nugent.\n\nAt 10:36:04, two and a half minutes after Lyon took the controls of Bushman 83, it started to climb, from 224ft to a maximum of 362ft, 14 seconds later.\n\nNine seconds into the climb, with the Taipan at 320ft, Nugent says to Lyon: \"Have you still got em?\" referring to Bushman 82, the aircraft flying ahead of them in the formation, to the right.\n\nLyon replies calmly: \"Yeah, still get em mate.\"\n\nDFSB investigators believe it was at this point that Lyon lost sight of Bushman 82. He quickly rolled the aircraft 31 degrees right before quickly rolling back left 8 degrees to establish a visual of the other aircraft.\n\nFile image: The MRH-90 Taipan was flying in formation with three others when it crashed into the ocean during an exercise. (AP) (Supplied)\n\nNeither Lyons nor Nugent appeared to have noticed that during the climb, the orientation of aircraft shifted from 5 degrees nose up to 5 degrees nose down \u2013 a 10 degrees shift.\n\nAt 10:36:19, Bushman 83 reached the top of its climb, now much higher than the three other helicopters in the formation. It is six seconds from disaster.\n\nUnaware that the pitch attitude had shifted from nose up to nose down, Lyon used the controls to pitch down, exacerbating the so-called \"pushover\".\n\nThe aircraft went into a quickening descent, hitting the water at 10:36:25 \u2013 21 seconds after it began to climb.\n\nWhen it hit to water it was travelling at 259kmh. Lyon, Nugent and aircrew Warrant Officer Phil Laycock and Corporal Alex Naggs were killed instantly.\n\nThe DFSB report found that in the split seconds before the crash, when the aircraft was in its fatal plunge, Lyon realised Bushman 83 was at risk of crashing into Bushman 82 and took immediate diversionary steps, rolling the aircraft to the right.\n\nThe wreckage the Taipan is removed from waters in the Whitsundays after the crash last year. (9News)\n\n\"During the two and a half seconds after the pushover, (flight data recorder) analysis indicates that the relative distance between the two aircraft decreased from approximately 100 metres to 50 metres,\" the DFSB report says.\n\n\"In response to this increasing closure, it is likely (Lyon) acted to avoid a potential mid-air collision with BSMN 82 by executing an avoidance turn to the right.\"\n\nLyon's actions in these last seconds, when his own aircraft was \"not recoverable\", likely saved the lives of the four airmen in Bushman 82.\n\nSince the July 2023 crash there has been much focus on the hi-tech TopOwl helmets used by the pilots that night.\n\nThe latest software upgrade for the TopOwl, HMSD v5.10, was found to carry significant risks, according to an experienced test pilot with the Army Aviation Test and Evaluation Section (AATES).\n\nThe test pilots found that the helmet was a \"substantial risk of multiple deaths\" and an \"unacceptable risk to flight safety\" because when pilots looks to the left or the right, the pitch and roll displays inverted.\n\nDespite this stark warning, TopOwl 5.0 was put into service when Army Aviation conducted its own tests in benign conditions, finding it safe to deploy.\n\nDFSB confirmed that TopOwl had its problems but said it was likely not responsible for Lyon becoming spatially disoriented.\n\n\"While both AATES and Standards Section test and evaluation reports agreed that there were deficiencies relating to attitude presentation, the two agencies disagreed on the severity of the hazard,\" DFSB said.\n\n\"Regardless, the investigation determined that it was very unlikely the known hazards relating to the HMSD v5.10 contributed to the loss of Spatial Orientation.",

Together, they set out to find The Entity's source code, and kill it.\n\n\"I love making movies. It's not what I do. It's who I am,\" Cruise told PEOPLE. (Supplied: Paramount Pictures)\n\nPhilosophically, it's a great concept: a crisis of humanity in the age of artificial intelligence, custom built for a superstar whose displays of everyman movie-going have done little to disguise his career-long Messiah complex.\n\nBut on screen, it amounts to an evil computer seizing control of the world's nuclear arsenal to wipe out the global populace \u2014 a premise so simple, and so cartoonishly boneheaded, that it hardly requires an hour of overwrought explanation to prime an audience for the action.\n\nExposition is what we get, however, and more of it than any multiplex patron should be reasonably asked to endure over a bucket of popcorn.\n\nIn order to make The Entity seem integral to the overarching series, The Final Reckoning twists itself into a narrative pretzel repurposing events from previous instalments, whose highlights are inserted with all the elegance of clip show.\n\nThat's President Erika Sloane to you (Angela Bassett). (Supplied: Paramount Pictures)\n\nThere are flashbacks to everything from the original 1996 movie to the more recent entries, in which the franchise increasingly became a series of stunts onto which the filmmakers hung a story.\n\nIs Tom Cruise our last action hero? Photo shows Tom Cruise hanging onto the wing of an airborne biplane. With the final Mission: Impossible film here, we take a look at how Tom Cruise has turned himself into this generation's great action hero.\n\nThose fond memories of high-tech break-ins, skyscraper acrobatics and motorcycle cliff-jumps might be enough to distract an audience from the fact that, more than an hour into the film, almost nothing has actually happened \u2014 though I did enjoy a moment of grief-stricken running, in which the sad-boy pathos behind Cruise's most celebrated Mission: Impossible move is finally brought to the fore.\n\nWhile co-writer and director Christopher McQuarrie's attempt at raising the stakes is ambitious \u2014 and he's almost certainly taken notes from Oppenheimer in building montages of abstract imagery \u2014 both he and Cruise seem to have forgotten the fact that nobody goes to a Mission: Impossible picture for the plot. We're here for the death-defying stunts, an element that makes up a surprisingly slender portion of this movie's crushing three-hour run time.\n\nTom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie have worked together on Jack Reacher and four Mission: Impossible films. (Supplied: Paramount Pictures)\n\nWhenever The Final Reckoning ditches the dialogue and unravels a set-piece, all is forgiven. Though it arrives nearly two hours into the movie, the first big action sequence, involving a perilous dive to an abandoned Russian submarine on the ocean floor, is appropriately tense and turbulent. Although, after all the movie's explanation and re-explanation, it's possible to have forgotten why Ethan is there in the first place.\n\nEven better is a nasty little scuffle on board an American sub, in which Ethan \u2014 all jet-black trunks and glistening torso \u2014 engages a henchman in a spot of daddy-coded homoerotic wrestling . (\"You! Spend! Too! Much! Time! On! The! Internet!\", Cruise admonishes his younger opponent, in between vicious kicks.)\n\nFor all of the movie's many (many) dreary stretches, the final stretch of action is as good as the series gets, as Cruise and his old antagonist Gabriel (Esai Morales) battle it out in a pair of bi-planes that rock and roll across the canyons of South Africa.\n\nEthan Hunt once again faces Gabriel in Final Reckoning, the villain committed a murder way back in 1996 that was directly responsible for bringing Hunt into the Impossible Mission Force. (Supplied: Paramount Pictures)\n\nRekindling the flyboy antics of Top Gun: Maverick, the sequence is a thrilling reminder of everything great about the M:I series \u2014 daredevil physicality, old-school seat-of-your-pants action, and a star in maniacal stunt mode, with nothing left to prove and every intention of doing so anyway.\n\nThat it's followed by one of the cheesiest, and creepiest, conclusions in recent franchise history is a testament to the fascinating contradictions of this series.\n\nCruise's desire to manifest himself, via Ethan, as all things to all people, is a reminder that the Mission: Impossible series has effectively been a decades-long project designed to enshrine him as an immortal \u2014 a work of art that's become inseparable from its star's own performance of life.\n\nIt's always been that, of course \u2014 but it used to be so much more fun.",

(Getty Images: UEFA/Alex Pantling)\n\nSaid by anyone else, at almost any other club, and the statement would have been met with the standard response to any pre-season bluster of a man desperate for success.\n\nAt Spurs though, it was just jarring. An anachronism. Spurs don't win things.\n\nAntonio Conte, at that stage a winner of 11 major trophies in Italy and England couldn't do it.\n\nNor could Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, a multiple trophy winner at almost every club he's ever managed couldn't get Spurs over the line either.\n\nNot even Spurs' most beloved manager of the modern era, Mauricio Pochettino, could take that final step towards silverware.\n\nThis is as close as Mauricio Pochettino got to leading Spurs to a trophy. (Getty Images: UEFA/Matthew Lewis)\n\nTottenham's almost lycanthropic aversion to silver was becoming legendary.\n\nSo when Postecoglou doubled down, the scorn was palpable.\n\n\"I'll correct myself \u2014 I don't usually win things, I always win things in my second year,\" Postecoglou told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I've said it now. I don't say things unless I believe them.\"\n\nFast forward eight months, with Spurs hiding near the bottom of the Premier League table after a torrid domestic season, it turns out Postecoglou was right after all.\n\nAnge Postecoglou was vindicated, winning Spurs a third UEFA Cup/Europa League trophy.

(Reuters: Andrew Couldridge)\n\nPostecoglou had selected a midfield of Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, all defensively minded players \u2014 albeit one that was born out of necessity more than anything else due to injury.\n\nLate in the match Spurs had three centre backs on the pitch, Kevin Danso joining Cristian Romero and van de Ven as Spurs shut up shop, a dramatic and glaring change from the attack at all costs line Postecoglou has pedalled in the league all year.\n\n\"Knockout football is always different,\" Postecoglou said, pointing to his experience in Australia of playing finals to win championships.\n\n\"All my teams have always played a little different in knockout games.\n\n\"Big games come down to moments, you've got to limit the moments of the opposition.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Again.\n\nIf his destiny lies away from North London, then so be it, but wherever the Aussie ends up next, he can walk down the Tottenham High Road with a spring in his step and his head held high.\n\n\"Que Sera, Sera,\" as Postecolgou said leaving the press conference.\n\nWhatever will be, will be.",

(Supplied.)\n\n\"The gym was spread across three small little demountable modulars, the ice baths were out on the balcony, the first space I walked into was a team meeting room \u2026 but the chairs that were in there were plastic chairs from Bunnings, and it was so tight that players were kind of falling off and stumbling off the chairs,\" Sarantinos said.\n\n\"Credit to them, the coaches and the players never used it as an excuse for performance but at some point it does have an impact.\n\nFunded by the NSW and federal government, the Hills Shire Council and Parramatta Leagues club, the Eels searched far and wide across professional sport, touring Premier League and NFL facilities to hone the design of the facility.\n\nThe Eels visited various sports organisations around the world to hone their design. (Supplied.)\n\nThere was also a special focus on integrating the club's history. The theatre room is named Jack's Bus, after the bus coach Jack Gibson used as a meeting place during the club's premiership years in the 80s.\n\nFormer Eels from those premiership sides like Brett Kenny, Peter Sterling, Peter Wynn, Mick Cronin, Eric Grothe and Ray Price all donated memorabilia to the club to give the new building a true blue and gold feel.\n\n\"We brought a number of players along for tours at different stages of the build and the biggest thing they were blown away by was just the size and the scale, particularly compared to the facilities that we were operating in,\" Sarantinos said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

        "text": "A drug that's been found to slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease by clearing proteins in the brain has been approved for use in Australia.\n\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved a drug called Donanemab for those with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe drug is given as an intravenous infusion through the arm every four weeks for a maximum of 18 months, and clinical trials have shown it can help in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIt is not a cure and doesn't stop cognitive decline, but it can slow the disease and allow people to have a better quality of life for longer.\n\nBut the drug, which is already approved in the UK and the US, is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at this stage, which means it is not subsidised by the government and will cost anywhere between $40,000 and $80,000 a year to administer.\n\n14 ways to cut dementia risk Photo shows A sculpture of a face and head with red lips and the skill absent showing the outline of a brain Many of the risk factors for dementia \u2013 being female, growing older and the genetic lottery \u2014 cannot be avoided. But research is uncovering a growing list of ways to cut your risk.\n\nResearchers said the fact it had been TGA-approved was huge news for the dementia community, especially after a similar treatment called Lecanemab was refused registration by the TGA last year due to safety risks.\n\nAlzheimer's is characterised by two proteins that accumulate in the brain, amyloid and tau.\n\nDonanemab works by clearing amyloid which can disrupt the brain's neurons and prevent messages from travelling normally.\n\nThe drug is an antibody that attaches itself to the amyloid and activates the immune system in the brain to clear the amyloid.\n\nAlzheimer's is the most common type of dementia, which is the leading cause of death for Australian women and the second most common for men.\n\nHead of dementia research at the Memory Clinic at Melbourne's Austin Health, Michael Woodward, said it was a \"very important development\" because until now drugs had only been mildly effective in targeting symptoms and not the underlying disease.\n\nFor some people with low to moderate disease progression, Donanemab can remove amyloid to a level that is below the threshold for diagnosis, said Professor Woodward, who was an investigator on the Donanemab clinical trials.\n\n\"It slows the deterioration by about 30 per cent and that's very important because if you have Alzheimer's you're likely already in your 70s or 80s and to have another six or 12 months of being able to function, help with the grandkids, go to events, remember day-to-day activities \u2014 that's going to significantly improve your life.\"\n\nIt doesn't work for those with moderate to severe dementia because the amyloid build-up is too severe by that stage.\n\nSide effects need close monitoring\n\nAmy Brodtmann, who leads the Cognitive Health Initiative at Monash University, compared the approval of Donanemab to when antivirals were first introduced to slow the progression of HIV.\n\n\"It's not a cure and we need to manage expectations but it's the very start of therapies I hope we will have and it is a chink in the armour,\" Professor Brodtmann said.\n\nDonanemab is not without its risks. Its two major side effects are brain swelling and bleeding.\n\nIt is thought that this can be the result of an over-activation of the brain's immune mechanisms.\n\nDuring clinical trials three people died from brain swelling or bleeding and around one-quarter of participants showed some form of swelling.\n\nLoading...\n\nProfessor Brodtmann said the complications often presented with no symptoms so regular MRI scans were necessary to ensure early detection of any side effects.\n\n\" I'm reassured by the fact there were very few people who had to discontinue the trial due to swelling or bleeding but we need to make sure people are being appropriately monitored. \"\n\nAnyone who has two copies of an Alzheimer's risk gene called ApoE4 is at a higher risk of brain swelling and bleeding and cannot take Donanemab so it is a TGA requirement that any patient considering the drug must have genetic testing to check for this gene.\n\nProfessor Brodtmann, who was involved in clinical trials and on the scientific advisory board for Donanemab, said there would be a network of cognitive services in most cities around Australia to administer the drug privately.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company that makes the drug, Eli Lilly, said an application for Donanemab to be listed on the PBS would be reviewed by the advisory committee in July.\n\nDonanemab was licensed for use in the UK last year but is still only available privately as it was not deemed to be cost-effective enough to be subsidised by the National Health System (NHS).",

        "text": "Funding for Tasmanian greyhound racing is rising faster than for education, according to independent economist Saul Eslake, who says the state government has \"an opportunity to stop throwing good money after bad\".\n\nMs Eslake said a report \u2014 commissioned by 12 animal welfare advocacy organisations, including RSPCA Tasmania, and Dogs Homes of Tasmania \u2014 found the sport had received a total of $74.6 million from Tasracing over the past 15 years, \"rising from $3.5 million in 2010-11 to a projected $7.5 million in 2024-25\".\n\nFunding for greyhound racing has risen by an annual average of 5.6 per cent over the past 15 years \u2014 faster than education funding over the same period (4.1 per cent), and general government sector spending (5.2 per cent).\n\nThe report also found the sport received $12.70 per head in 2023-24 \u2014 more than twice the national average of $5.27.\n\nSaul Eslake found state funding of the sport had doubled in the past 15 years. (Greyhound racing, Michoff, CC License)\n\nMr Eslake wrote that the returns were \"diminishing\", with attendances, race starters, wagering and employment declining.\n\nFor every $1,000 the code received, four people attended a race meeting in 2021-22 \u2014 down from 6.4 in 2011-12.\n\nThe industry also supports 82 jobs for each $1 million it receives, down from 150 in 2011-12.\n\n\"The question that ought to be asked is what's so special about racing, and in particular greyhound racing, that it should be so much more generously funded than other things which larger numbers of Tasmanians enjoy,\" Mr Eslake said.\n\nA report by IER, performed for Tasracing, found that in 2021-22, greyhound racing sustained and created 639 full or part-time jobs, or 0.2 per cent of the state's employment.\n\nA government spokesperson said the state government was committed to supporting \"the longevity and sustainability of an industry that generates close to $208 million in economic activity for Tasmania per year\".\n\n\"It is deceptive to suggest that the $242 million spent on education and education facilities in the 2024-25 budget is comparable to the $7.31 million spent on greyhound racing,\" it said.\n\nTasracing has been contacted for comment.\n\nInvestment 'lousy' and 'unpopular'\n\nActivists call for better transparency on 'racing-related deaths' Photo shows A racing greyhound highlighted mid-race. Animal welfare activists are concerned the \"true breadth of racing-related deaths\" in the greyhound industry are unknown.\n\nDeb Fleming, who is representing the 12 organisations that commissioned the report, said animal welfare concerns were not being heeded by the government or the Labor opposition, which both support greyhound racing.\n\n\"They fall back on justifying the well-known animal welfare issues \u2014 that are just unavoidable in dog racing \u2014 by saying it's vital for the economy, particularly in the regions, and that it provides lots of jobs and lots of benefits to the economy,\" she said.\n\n\"So we thought it was a reasonable thing to obtain an independent interrogation of those claims from one of the most respected independent economists in the country.\"\n\nShe said Mr Eslake's report made it clear that greyhound racing was a \"dud investment\".\n\n\"It's also a very unpopular one,\" she said.\n\nSixty-two per cent of respondents to a 2023 EMRS poll were opposed to greyhound racing, while about 79 per cent agreed the government should stop spending money on it.\n\nTasracing has released a draft Code of Practice for Racing Greyhound Welfare, which it says will provide \"critically important assurances\" to the public about welfare oversight. (Pixabay: herbert2512)\n\n'Growing case' to ending funding\n\nTasracing, which manages the state's three racing codes, is backed by a 20-year funding deed it signed with the Tasmanian government in 2009.\n\nWhile it was then worth $27 million per year, it is indexed for inflation. Tasracing received just over $36 million in 2023-2024.\n\nThat represents about half of its income, with the remainder coming via wagering, entry fees, media rights, and sponsorship.\n\nThe deed is partially funded by the sale of betting agency TOTE Tasmania, which the government sold for $103 million in 2011.\n\nWith the current deal set to expire in 2029, Tasracing and the state government are currently in negotiations for a new one.\n\nA government spokesperson said work \"has begun on the Terms of Reference for the identification of funding models available to the government for the next Tasracing funding deed\".\n\nSaul Eslake says greyhound racing's popularity \"declining significantly\". (ABC News: Owain Stia-James)\n\nMr Eslake described the negotiations as an \"opportunity\", and said there was a \"growing case\" for the taxpayer not to back greyhound racing.\n\n\"Its popularity is declining significantly \u2014 especially in the aftermath of revelations concerning animal welfare,\" he said.\n\n\" Not just in Tasmania, but in almost every one of the diminishing number of places around the world where commercial greyhound racing still takes place. \"\n\nNew welfare code released for feedback\n\nTasracing has released a draft Code of Practice for Racing Greyhound Welfare, which it says is similar to standards in place in other jurisdictions.\n\n\"While it was prepared to provide guidance to the Tasmanian industry, it also provides critically important assurances to the Tasmanian public about the welfare oversight of racing greyhounds in the state,\" said chief veterinary and animal welfare officer Martin Lenz.\n\nThe final code will be enforceable under the Rules of Racing.\n\n\"Amongst other things, it specifies minimum standards for accommodation, management, breeding, socialisation and care required to meet the physical and behavioural needs of a racing greyhound throughout its entire life cycle,\" Dr Lenz said.\n\n\" The document also very clearly references that a racing greyhound is a long-term responsibility and owners must make provisions for the greyhound's eventual retirement from racing and its appropriate rehoming. \"",

ASIC says the consumer paid up to $1,433 more for this product than they should have.\n\nIn addition, Snaffle is alleged to have failed to disclose the cash price and true cost of the credit provided under each of the three contracts, as required by the NCC\n\nSeparately, ASIC alleges as many as 40,430 credit contracts may have had a flat interest rate incorrectly applied to the full purchase cost of the goods for the whole term of the contract, rather than interest being calculated on the unpaid balance which reduces over time as required by the NCC.\n\nASIC today published a new review of consumer leases, which are contracts that allow a consumer to rent an item for a set period, typically making repayments weekly or fortnightly until the lease ends.\n\nIts review notes that almost 25 per cent of consumer leases are in arrears, and that consumer lease providers obtain 80 per cent of their repayments via Centrepay deductions, indicating the financial vulnerability of many Australians.\n\nASIC's review also found that since consumer lease protection reforms were introduced in 2023, many providers that previously offered consumer leases for household goods had left the sector to move into alternate credit products that create risks.\n\n\"Enforcement action against misconduct by credit providers and predatory lending is a key enforcement priority for ASIC,\" Ms Court said.\n\nASIC is seeking declarations against snaffle's owner Walker Stores of breaches of various provisions of the NCC, pecuniary penalties, injunctions and adverse publicity orders.\n\nThe company has been contacted for comment.",

(Supplied: Bendigo Art Gallery)\n\nGallery to attract bigger exhibits\n\nA 1,000-square-metre first-floor space for major exhibitions is proposed as part of the redevelopment.\n\nMs Bridgfoot said that would allow the gallery to attract even bigger and more exclusive exhibits without sacrificing space for community and education programs.\n\n\"We're already planning 2028 and beyond,\" she said.\n\nThe ground floor will be free to visit and will retain three historic galleries and add a learning centre and theatrette.\n\nJessica Bridgfoot says the redevelopment will allow the gallery to host bigger and better exhibitions. (ABC Central Victoria: Anna McGuinness)\n\nIt will also include a place of keeping to house cultural artefacts of the Dja Dja Wurrung people.\n\n\"In 2018 we worked with them on a really significant project and brought 20 cultural artefacts back to Bendigo on Djaara country,\" Ms Bridgfoot said.\n\n\" It allows us to work with traditional owners to facilitate more repatriation from countries all across the world and collections abroad. \"\n\nThe Victorian Government has contributed $21m to the project, alongside $9m from the council and $4m from the gallery board.\n\nHowever not everyone is excited about the redevelopment.\n\nThe size and scale of the design has drawn opposition from the Bendigo branch of the National Trust which said it threatened the 19th century heritage streetscape.\n\nJessica Bridgfoot and Andrew Cooney in front of the gallery's View Street entrance. (ABC Central Victoria: Anna McGuinness)\n\nCity of Greater Bendigo chief executive Andrew Cooney said the redevelopment would be \"sympathetic to the streetscape\".\n\n\"We think it sits really neatly with the buildings that surround it,\" he said.\n\nThe gallery is expected to be closed until early 2028 and plans are in place for an offsite program to maintain tourism and community engagement.\n\n\"We'll do everything we can over the next couple of years to make sure that we've still got people coming to Bendigo and those businesses can still benefit,\" Mr Cooney said.",

        "text": "Within the 90-day pause in the wider tit-for-tat tariff war between the US and China, however, the tariff rate was reduced to 54 per cent, with the $US100 flat fee remaining. The US actions caused Shein and Temu to increase their prices to US consumers and to rethink their business models, diversifying their supply chains to source products from countries facing lower tariffs and, in Temu\u2019s case, halting its direct shipping model and scrambling to find US suppliers. Even without Trump\u2019s aggressive trade war on everyone the rest of the world has been starting to consider how to avoid being overwhelmed by the threatened flood of cheap products. Credit: Bloomberg The fear elsewhere is that they would seek to compensate for lower US sales by stepping up their marketing and supply to other economies. In Europe, the European Union has proposed levying a flat fee of \u20ac2 ($A3.50) per parcel on small packages. Europe is already a major and fast-growing destination for low-value exports from China, with 4.6 billion parcels attracting de minimus status last year, 90 per cent of them from China.\n\nThat was about twice the volume experienced in 2023 and, indeed, a far greater volume than that experienced by the US, where about 1.2 billion packages \u2013 some Congressional estimates are far higher -- originated from within China and Hong Kong last year. (It is difficult to be precise about the volumes because there is so little data collected on the volume and nature of those parcels). Loading The EU\u2019s draft proposal says the new fee will apply to parcels sent directly to consumers. If they are sent to a warehouse, they would attract a fee of only \u20ac0.50. It is easier, and less costly, to process goods and collect revenue from a warehouse than it is from individual parcels at the border. The de minimus exemptions common to most advanced economies reflect the cost and complexity of imposing and collecting revenue from small parcel imports, indeed that was the original rationale for the exemption which, in the US, dates back to 1938. With the costs and effort of applying and collecting duties seen as greater than the revenue that might be raised, the parcels were regarded as too insignificant to bother about \u2013 until the volumes began soaring in the past few years.\n\nThe European approach is essentially designed to recover those costs of administering the regime rather than the revenue-raising, imports-deterring tariffs approach favoured by the US. Japan has convened a panel of tax experts to consider removing its exemption from duties for parcels worth less than 10,000 yen ($108). It is contemplating applying its sales tax \u2013 around 10 per cent \u2013 to small parcels. It\u2019s not just the use of what has been exploited as a loophole in tariff and duty arrangements by mainly Chinse exporters that is concerning legislators. Small parcel imports, which aren\u2019t inspected, have become a route for illegal drug imports, counterfeit goods and products that don\u2019t meet the receiving countries\u2019 safety standards. The topic of how to respond to a prospective increase in what is already a flood of low-value exports from China was even raised at this week\u2019s G7 meeting of the finance ministers in Canada Credit: AP There\u2019s also a concern about the impact the rapidly-growing influx of cheap products from China (and some very sophisticated circumvention of local sales and income tax regimes) is having on domestic manufacturers and retailers.\n\nIn the US, even the retail behemoth Amazon was so concerned about the impact of Shein and Temu on its business that it copied them and set up its own direct-to-consumer model, shipping directly from warehouses in China to US consumers. Shein and Temu are the most visible, and largest, of China\u2019s small parcel exporters, so the walls that are being erected to slow or halt their tide of cheap products threaten their businesses. They are not, of course, the only Chinese companies that have been exploiting the de minimum loophole and it\u2019s not just that exemption that is causing concern in other economies. With China\u2019s domestic economy stuttering and domestic demand weak, its factories have been deploying their significant excess capacity into export markets. Even as the volume of exports has surged, export prices have been falling. That tide of cheap exports \u2013 factory-gate prices have been sliding steadily for more than two years \u2013 some of them from industries subsidised, directly or indirectly, by various levels of China\u2019s governments, is seen as a threat to advanced economies and their domestic manufacturers.\n\nEven without Trump\u2019s aggressive trade war on everyone \u2013 which threatens to divert China\u2019s exports to the US to other markets, particularly Europe \u2013 the rest of the world has been starting to consider how to avoid being overwhelmed by the threatened flood of cheap products. They want to avoid the experience of the 1990s, when the initial impact of China\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s manufacturing base wiped out large swathes of western industry and jobs. Shein and Temu are the most visible, and largest, of China\u2019s small parcel exporters, so the walls that are being erected to slow or halt their tide of cheap products threaten their businesses. China\u2019s manufacturing base is now far larger \u2013 its share of global manufacturing output is above 30 per cent \u2013 and it now produces and exports goods of higher value and in more strategic sectors than it did in the 1990s. Unrestricted imports from China would do considerable domestic economic damage to the rest of the world. Those exports exploiting the de minimum exemption are, therefore, elements within a larger picture but, given their sheer volume and startling growth rates, not insignificant ones.",

Wayne Taylor Previous Slide Next Slide Japanese$$$$ Is too much matcha ever enough? Not at Sana, where matcha outsells coffee. Open since February, Sana is drawing customers from an hour away for social-media-famous matcha drinks and Asian-inspired brunches. But you don\u2019t need to trawl TikTok: I\u2019ve got the lowdown. Sana is a destination cafe, at least in the sense that you would never stumble upon it, here on the light-industrial fringe of a low-rise housing estate with kid-friendly cul-de-sacs. Even though we\u2019re in Cheltenham, 20 kilometres south of the city, parking is tricky. During the week you\u2019ll be more likely to find a spot for the car and a seat in the cafe, either in the sheltered front porch or inside, where tables are arranged around a central drinks station as busy with matcha-whisking as milk-steaming. Related Article From udon carbonara to a hot-choc haven: Five new cafes to try (and what to order)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything is light, bright and fresh, chic rather than cosy, with whitewashed bricks, concrete flooring and tiles in shades of pink. (I visited with a friend who uses a wheelchair. The toilets in the cafe aren\u2019t accessible, but there are disabled facilities in the adjoining foyer.) Banana milk matcha, a trending Korean drink. Wayne Taylor Matcha is a finely ground powder made from shade-grown green tea leaves, hand-picked only in spring, then steamed and slowly ground to an iridescent sprinkle. Whisked, poured and served according to protocols with roots in Zen Buddhism, matcha is the traditional beverage in Japanese tea ceremonies. In a Kyoto temple, matcha is usually sipped in its simplest form, combined with hot water using a bamboo whisk. In fashionable cafes in Melbourne, it\u2019s served hot, cold, layered, foamed and baked into desserts. The best matcha tastes grassy, rounded and deep, astringent but not too bitter. At Sana, the matcha latte is a good example of the genre. Some cafes use pre-batched matcha cordial, but they hand-whisk to order here. Matcha is also mixed with \u201cbanana milk\u201d, an on-trend Korean beverage that sits as a pleasant, mild backdrop for the tea. Need more? Whisper to the waiter that you want the secret menu, and you\u2019ll have nine more matcha drinks to choose from: iced matcha with Earl Grey is a good place to start. Sana\u2019s owner Steve Chrun moved from Sydney to Melbourne so his wife could be closer to her family. Up north, the former finance guy launched popular cafes Celsius in Kirribilli (now sold) and Cafe Monstera in Mosman Bay (still in the stable). They\u2019re both waterfront cafes with contemporary eggs \u2018n\u2019 extras menus. Sana is different, with views of townhouses rather than bobbing yachts and more of a Japanese culinary angle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUdon carbonara. Wayne Taylor Udon carbonara is an Asian fusion staple; this is a smart rendition, the chewy, cheese-scattered noodles served alongside soy-glazed thick-cut bacon, oozy egg yolk and a little dashi broth, which helps smooth the flavours and lighten the dish. Avocado toast is a cheery pile of lightly charred avo (smoky, but not warm or gross), spicy hummus and wasabi \u201cgranola\u201d (grains stirred with blitzed wasabi peas, which is a clever touch). The same granola base, this time mixed with cocoa rather than peas, is scattered over an acai bowl which amps up the colour and flavours with tropical fruit and a fudgy square of brownie. As winter hits, look for hot waffles instead of chilly acai. Wagyu mince is turned into a spiced pattie, crumbed, fried and splodged with curry pickle mayo for the milk-loaf sandwich. Tapping into trends and hype can feel cynical, but Sana is more about joy, fun and a sincere welcome. Yes, there\u2019s a not-so-secret menu, but the real secret to Sana\u2019s success is that Chrun and his team are still surprised and grateful that people are seeking out the place: if you whisk it, they will come. Three more matcha specialists to try Matcha Kobo This new city spot stone-mills matcha then whisks it to order for specialty hot and cold drinks. There\u2019s table seating, but you can really channel Kyoto by sitting cross-legged on cushions in the faux temple area.

        "text": "Those theories - that he could quit - have been put to bed by the man himself, and firmly. He says his work isn\u2019t done and that he\u2019ll be disappointed if he is asked to stop. He\u2019s been fighting publicly for the club through weeks and months of doubt and hate from his own supporters, and he wants to see this thing through. He has shown his players, as he put it, how to \u201cclimb a mountain\u201d, and now the next one they scale should be a little easier. \u201cI still feel there\u2019s a lot of work to be done \u2026 but not as much work as people may think,\u201d he said. \u201cI really feel that tonight can be a great platform for us to kick on.\u201d So now it\u2019s over to chairman Daniel Levy. Surely, there is no way he could sack him now. It would be the stupidest thing he could possibly do. It would no doubt trigger a revolt from the players, and then an exodus, and then send the worst possible message to whoever his replacement is: even achieving the extraordinary isn\u2019t enough at Tottenham Hotspur. Ange Postecoglou and Daniel Levy. Credit: Getty Images Look at the way the players celebrated - not only with each other, not only with Postecoglou, but about Postecoglou. He lurked off to the side when they did their initial trophy lift, rebuffed their first invitation to join them, and then was reluctantly dragged into the middle of the pack. Afterwards, the injured James Maddison and Sergio Regulion - banished to less than a bit-part role under the coach and surely bound for the exit in the summer, which means he has every reason to hold a grudge if he wanted to - held up a banner brought in by fans which showed Postecoglou holding the Europa League trophy, wearing those meme \u2018thug life\u2019 sunglasses, and the declaration for which he is now globally famous: \u201cI don\u2019t usually win things, I ALWAYS win things in my second year.\u201d\n\nMaddison posted that line again on X a little later, still marvelling at his boss\u2019s boldness. \u201cBruhhhhhhhh,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the former England international Micah Richards on the TNT Sports coverage could barely contain himself, yelling at Postecoglou: \u201cHOW DOES THAT FEEL? COME ON! I\u2019VE BEEN BACKING YOU ALL SEASON, I LOVE YOUR FOOTBALL, YOU\u2019VE HAD YOUR INJURIES, YOUNG PLAYERS, BUT YOU DID IT TONIGHT!\u201d His response? \u201cI can\u2019t say the same for everyone on the panel,\u201d noting the presence of Jamie Carragher, one of his biggest critics. Postecoglou had another little jab for Levy in his presser, again demonstrating his elephant-like memory. Not long after he was appointed, Levy acknowledged in a fan forum that Spurs had erred in the past by going for \u201ctrophy managers\u201d, or win-now guys like Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or Antonio Conte, whose philosophies didn\u2019t align with the club\u2019s DNA. Postecoglou, of course, was a perfect match - but the inference was that he wasn\u2019t a \u201ctrophy manager\u201d.\n\nHe always was, and he is again. \u201cEven Daniel sort of said: \u2018we went after winners, it didn\u2019t work, and now we\u2019ve got Ange.\u2019 Mate, I\u2019m a winner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a serial winner my whole career. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done more than anything else. I know people talk about my football, which I\u2019m very proud of \u2026 and I know people dismiss my achievements because they didn\u2019t happen on this side of the world. But for me, they\u2019re all hard-earned, and all I\u2019ve done my whole career is win things.\u201d There is an irony, though. Postecoglou won this trophy not through classic Angeball but through Mourinho-like grit, and long periods of Conte-style suffering. Spurs had only 27.7 per cent of possession and completed just 115 passes for the whole match - the lowest such figures Opta has recorded by any team in a major European final.\n\nLoading The goal they scored, on the stroke of half-time, was fittingly ugly - albeit, generated by a beautiful cross from Pape Matar Sarr which spotted a great run from Brennan Johnson, but he hardly connected with it, and the ball went in off Luke Shaw and past the turnstile arms of Andre Onana. Johnson was credited with it in the end, and he deserved the moment; in September he deactivated his social media accounts amid a deluge of abuse from Tottenham fans who couldn\u2019t see the things he brought to the team, the things that Postecoglou could see. That was his 17th goal for the season. He is their top-scorer. Maybe now they can see. From then on, it was about getting in the trenches. They said Postecoglou and this group of players couldn\u2019t defend. Didn\u2019t know how. They were wrong - although it helped that United, in turn, couldn\u2019t attack. Postecoglou chalked up his marked tactical change in the Europa League to the demands of knockout football. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of success in my career in not just winning leagues, but in Australia, I grew up playing finals football to win a championship,\u201d he said. \u201cKnockout football is always different. All my teams have always played a little bit different in knockout games \u2026 big games come down to moments. You\u2019ve got to limit the moments of the opposition.\u201d It\u2019s true, but not the whole truth. Even in cut-throat moments, Postecoglou\u2019s teams have never been so direct or defensively minded.\n\nBut, honestly, who cares? The most important thing was that they got the monkey off their back. Now all the self-defeating \u2018Spursy\u2019 talk can stop, and they can chart a course forward - ideally playing some sort of synthesis between the mesmerising attacking stuff Postecoglou has dedicated his career to, and the solidity and flexibility displayed in the Europa League. Loading Later this week, Postecoglou and his team will be lauded in north London with an open-top bus parade with their new silverware. After that, they host Brighton & Hove Albion in their final Premier League fixture. After that, there are no planned meetings between Levy and Postecoglou - not yet, anyway. \u201cMaybe they felt like they don\u2019t need to, or they\u2019re waiting for this game,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, what I do know is that I\u2019m going to go back to my hotel room, get my family and friends together, open up a nice bottle of scotch, have a couple of quiet ones \u2026 and then Monday I\u2019m going on holidays with my beautiful family because I deserve it.",

        "text": "The 707 was Australia\u2019s VIP jetliner, but it had seen better days. The little fleet of 707s came from the late 1950s/early \u201960s era when rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and V8 hot rods ruled and noise pollution wasn\u2019t a problem. By the time Keating was PM, the RAAF had to beg permission to land the 707 at many international airports because its two old engines made such a racket, even after they were fitted with exhaust baffles. In 1992, when Keating made an official visit to Tokyo, the Japanese politely explained its international airport, Narita, wasn\u2019t suitable. Paul Keating\u2019s plan for a two new prime ministerial planes was grounded in 1993. Credit: Getty Images They directed the RAAF to land at Tokyo\u2019s domestic airport, which presumably had vintage spanner sets for elderly airframes if the plane broke down.\n\nIt was humiliating for a prime minister like Keating, whom cartoonists cruelly drew as the modern embodiment of the extravagantly self-absorbed Sun King, France\u2019s Louis XIV. I had by then spent happy years flying around the world in the old 707s as part of the press gallery pack. We called it the Zoo Plane. Wine of fine vintage and high jinks of great silliness flowed freely in the media cabin down the back. Until Keating became PM, Bob Hawke smoked cigars and played poker in his suite at the front. It was a most agreeable way to travel the world. But then, in mid-1993, not long after Keating unexpectedly won the federal election against John Hewson, word floated my way through Canberra\u2019s rarefied air that the triumphant PM was on the lookout for a new VIP plane. Two, in fact.\n\nQuiet conversations confirmed Keating\u2019s desire for more-fitting VIP airborne transport, but that his department was on a collision course with the Defence Department, which was worried about the cost. The two planes being considered were Boeing 757s. They weren\u2019t flown by any airline in Australia, but they were big and modern and desirable. And expensive. Tony Wright\u2019s story on Paul Keating\u2019s jet plans in The Sydney Morning Herald, June 16, 1993. Credit: When my story was published in The Sydney Morning Herald, all hell broke loose. The public went into a mild uproar, Keating\u2019s Labor colleagues went weak at the knees, and I, as the messenger, got a number of shouty phone calls from offices not too far from the prime minister\u2019s own parliamentary suite.\n\nEven Keating suddenly found himself unwilling to test the generosity of voters, many of whom were still recovering from what he had called, only three years previously, \u201cthe recession we had to have\u201d. The story killed the planned purchase of new VIP planes stone dead. Keating was still flying around in the ancient 707s three years later when he lost the prime ministership to John Howard. I was not allowed to forget it. Every time I stepped aboard the 707 for a trip overseas, I was reminded by Keating\u2019s staff that if the plane fell out of the sky, I was to blame for writing \u201cthat bloody story\u201d.\n\nLoading Press gallery colleagues, unhappy at being scooped, took up the sledging with glee. And Keating continued to yearn for a plane more suited to a prime minister of style. In 1995, on a trip to Germany, no sooner had we landed in Bonn than the poor unloved 707 was rolled into a darkened hangar and Keating proceeded to Berlin in a magnificently appointed Airbus lent to him by chancellor Helmut Kohl. Some among the travelling media declared Keating looked green each time he emerged from the Airbus\u2019 VIP suite with its gold appointments in the bathroom, its conference room and its super-modern communications.\n\nI felt a bit sympathetic. It wasn\u2019t unusual for fittings in the ancient 707s to judder loose. I once copped a thump to the head when an internal ceiling panel fell out. Keating was correct. The VIP fleet desperately needed replacements. John Howard eventually got a Boeing Business Jet that was (conveniently) too small to accommodate travelling journalists. The current fleet consists of two Boeing 737s, ordered by Scott Morrison\u2019s government and used these days by Anthony Albanese, the governor-general and others. The point, however, was that a prime minister in Australia\u2019s political system could not unilaterally choose the style of VIP plane available to him or her. Australia pays for its own perquisites, which are decided by federal departments like Defence and Prime Minister and Cabinet, which have rules and budgets.\n\nIt is unimaginable that an Australian prime minister would consider accepting a jumbo jet-sized bribe from a foreign country. Loading All senators and members of the House of Representatives are required to list their pecuniary interests in a register. The allowable limit for gifts from another government is $750, and from individuals it is $300. A $600 million jet would appear mighty peculiar in any list of pecuniary interests. Anywhere, really, outside Trump\u2019s morally warped Washington.",

        "text": "At Gairlochy, the first lock north of Neptune\u2019s Staircase, we rendezvous with the barge after two hours of walking. With the locks along the canal closing each evening, halting all boat traffic, we moor below the gates in motionless wait for morning. The shores of Loch Lochy are just beyond, and the only sounds to reach us are from within \u2013 the movement of our six passengers and three crew, and the welcome clatter of Mike, the Fingal\u2019s chef, at work in the open galley. A pattern soon settles over the days, with walks each morning and afternoon, returning to the Fingal for lunches of soup and barge-baked bread and baguettes. As the barge squeezes into Gairlochy\u2019s locks after breakfast the next morning, its 180 tonnes rising on an elevator of water, we continue hiking along the GGW. Along the southern shores of Loch Lochy, the Way is at its most beautiful, framed by mountains and winding through forest so green even the light seems tinged with colour. It was on these shores that Allied troops trained for the D-Day landings in 1945, and here that Achnacarry, the ancestral estate of the Clan Cameron chiefs, sprawls across an isthmus between Loch Lochy and Loch Arkaig. The GGW marches blindly past Achnacarry, but we turn up a hidden path beside a village church to enter the estate. Looking over green fields and sheep to its Scottish Baronial castle, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve stepped into every British period drama ever filmed. Sunrise over Achnacarry and Loch Lochy near Fort William. Credit: iStock Alongside the castle there\u2019s a clan museum, but we\u2019re bound for the Dark Mile at the estate\u2019s far end. Though it sounds like something from a Stephen King novel, the Dark Mile looks more like something from a fairy tale \u2013 a mile-long country lane where the drystone walls and the roadside trees and earth are inches thick in moss. Through this cushioned landscape we return to the loch, where the barge\u2019s tender awaits us, one of our longest walking days done after just 11 kilometres.\n\nThe presence of the barge allows us this kind of ease that\u2019s uncommon on long-distance trails. Along the canal, we simply step off the barge directly onto the paths. On the lochs, the tender ferries us to and from the shores. Walking along the foot of Ben Nevis, Britain\u2019s highest peak. Credit: iStock Once aboard, one half of the barge is a communal space of couches, an honesty bar of local whiskies and craft beers, an extensive library and a large dining table for meals \u2013 from ox-cheek broth to Balmoral chicken stuffed with haggis \u2013 that we share with the crew. At Laggan Locks, at the head of Loch Lochy, the Caledonian Canal performs its greatest trick. So much of the canal was built beside rivers, but here it needed to cross a low hill that rose as a watershed within the Great Glen. It was the final section of the canal to be constructed \u2013 a two-kilometre-long hurdle \u2013 but it took 500 workers seven years to complete. Known today as Laggan Avenue, it\u2019s a section that\u2019s wasted on walkers, with the canal obscured by trees, so we remain aboard as the Fingal motors on from the locks. For half an hour, it feels more like an Amazon cruise than a Scottish walking trip, with a jungle-like strip of forest reaching down to and over the canal.\n\n\u201cThis is totally different to any canal I\u2019ve ever been on,\u201d says skipper Adam Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite part of the canal.\u201d Soon, the canal widens again into Loch Oich and finally Loch Ness, Scotland\u2019s most famous body of water. Its dimensions are as monstrous as its myths \u2013 containing more water than all the lakes and rivers in England and Wales combined, it\u2019s up to 300 metres deep, giving it a sense of mystery that fuelled the legend of Nessie. Canal and boat lift connecting Loch Ness at Fort Augustus. Credit: iStock We continue to use the water as a diving board into a host of trails \u2013 walks to waterfalls, over low hills, through blueberry-carpeted forests and eventually to the Caledonian Canal\u2019s end at the Moray Firth. In Loch Ness, we moor by a pier in Foyers, on the loch\u2019s quieter and wilder eastern side, where we\u2019ve watched goats grazing at the water\u2019s edge and been circled by a sea eagle \u2013 the largest bird in the UK. But the best comes in the calm of dawn as I take my coffee up onto the deck of the barge.\n\nLess than 100 metres ahead of us, a stream pours into the loch through a green glow of forest. As I watch, two deer step out of the trees and into Loch Ness. As they dip their heads to drink, not a single other thing around the loch seems to move. Loading Far across the water, on the path proper for the GGW, there will be hikers now stirring, packing up tents or already on the move. But here, I\u2019m in no hurry. We will soon sail towards Inverness and the trip\u2019s end but, for the moment, I have the most beautiful and natural of company.

        "text": "Ange Postecoglou has delivered the greatest triumph of his career, clutching a potentially job-saving lifeline by steering beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur to Europa League glory in Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trailblazer became the first Australian manager to win a trophy in a major European club competition as Spurs beat fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao for their first trophy in 17 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nA scrappy first-half goal from Brennan Johnson was ultimately enough to give Tottenham victory in a poor-quality match during which they had to survive a wave of late pressure from Ruben Amorim's United.\n\n\n\nBut, will the victory be enough to save Postecoglou's job?\n\nAs a beaming Postecoglou celebrated the victory at the San Mames Stadium, the only question that remained was whether victory, which guarantees Champions League football for Spurs next season, would be enough to save the 59-year-old from the sack.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Who is Ange Postecoglou? How a Greek immigrant is conquering the football world\n\nIt's said he is already doomed, regardless of the result. If so, what a glorious way for \"Big Ange\" to make what matchwinner Johnson called a glorious \"mic drop\" exit \u2014 with Tottenham's first European trophy for 41 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Postecoglou chose this moment of glory to declare his intent: \"I do [want to stay]. I don't feel like I've completed the job here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The moment I accepted the role, I had one thing in my head, and that is to win something \u2014 and we've done that now. I want to build on it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nGoalscorer Johnson paid tribute to Postecoglou, saying: \"He's done his job. He says he wins in his second year and he has \u2014 and if there's ever a time for a mic drop, it's now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut referring to his now-celebrated early season observation that he always wins a trophy in his second season, Postecoglou reflected: \"It wasn't me boasting. It was me just making a declaration \u2014 and I believed it.\"\n\n\n\nTottenham's Brennan Johnson celebrates after winning against Manchester United. Source: AP / Jose Breton \"I know our league form's been terrible [finishing 17th], nowhere near good enough and unacceptable, but us finishing third wasn't going to change his football club. The only thing that was going to change this football club is us winning something, and when I said that, that was my intent,\" Postecoglou said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I fell short. I was happy to cop it, but I believed it inside me. That was my ambition. I wanted it stated \u2014 and I was prepared to wear it if it didn't happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt did happen \u2014 and his players wanted to remind everyone about Postecoglou's quote as they carried around a banner proclaiming it. There's no question they're 100 per cent behind Postecoglou and his Australian staff, Nick Montgomery, Sergio Raimundo and Mile Jedinak.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The US federal medicines regulator is changing how it approves COVID-19 vaccinations, a move that may restrict access to millions of children and adults under the new criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is altering the type of evidence it will accept from vaccine manufacturers and will require new clinical trials for approval of annual COVID-19 boosters for healthy Americans under the age of 65.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes mean people under 65 may no longer be eligible for new COVID-19 vaccinations, an infectious diseases expert told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland, who has also run clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccinations, described the FDA's decision as \"absurd\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Restricting access to vaccines can only increase the impact of COVID-19,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Has COVID changed in five years? What to know as winter looms\n\n\"If we restrict vaccines to people over 65, as appears to be the case in the US, there's a whole host of people who may get a more significant infection who won't have the option to be protected,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why is the FDA making changes?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes down to what US health officials say is a lack of evidence about the efficacy of COVID-19 boosters.\n\n\n\nWhat's happening in the US?\n\nFDA commissioner Marty Makary and top US vaccines regulator Vinay Prasad wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday that the benefit of repeated annual shots for healthy adults was uncertain after several years of the virus circulating and vaccines being available.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also said the US was an outlier among high-income nations in recommending yearly shots for healthy adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At-risk Americans can be reassured that they will be covered by such approvals. At the same time, we want more evidence at the US Food and Drug Administration,\" Prasad told scientists at the FDA during a live-streamed presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to know more about what these products are doing, especially as we enter the seventh, eighth and ninth dose.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is the election promise of cheaper medicines under threat from US tariffs?\n\nMakary and Prasad said they expect the FDA will be able to approve the boosters for adults over the age of 65 based on data from tests that measure immune response in patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shots would also be available for everyone over the age of six months with one or more issues that put them at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for healthy people between the ages of six months and 64 years, the FDA expects it would require formal clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies to get approval to manufacture annual shots.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrasad said all the COVID-19 vaccine makers will be asked to conduct placebo-controlled trials in healthy 50 to 64-year-olds and encouraged to conduct them in very young children.\n\n\n\n'Unethical' process\n\nGriffin warned millions of healthy adults and children stand to lose access to updated vaccines under the new criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While people with co-morbidities and the elderly are typically more vulnerable, the unfortunate reality is severe disease isn't restricted to those groups,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Five years after COVID - are we ready for the next pandemic? SBS News 11/03/2025 03:30 Play\n\nRequiring new, expensive and lengthy clinical trials for approved vaccines was a step backward in his view, and using placebos in these trials is \"unethical\", he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we're looking at improving or updating vaccines, we don't typically go back to including placebos because essentially it's unethical to do so,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there's a vaccine already approved, there's a reason that's the case. And so then to enrol people in a clinical trial and basically restrict them from receiving what would be considered best practice is actually unethical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Typically, when we're improving vaccines, we include the current standard of care, the approved vaccine rather than a true placebo.\"\n\n\n\nGriffin said the FDA decision may be influenced by anti-vaccine sentiment in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, one of the country's top vaccine critics whose department oversees the FDA , has been reshaping the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines while also taking steps to align with US President Donald Trump's goal of shrinking the federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 20,000 people have left the department as part of mass layoffs.\n\n\n\nHow will supply and cost be impacted?\n\nRoger Lord, a senior lecturer in medical sciences at the Australian Catholic University, said the risks of serious hospitalisation would be less for younger healthy people who have already received boosters and may not need a yearly shot to increase their immunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for those still wanting to get vaccinated, supplies could decrease, and costs increase, he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Does it matter which arm gets a vaccine? A new study offers some clues\n\nAs clinical trials are expensive undertakings for pharmaceutical companies, they could also lead to delays, Lord said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to any drug or vaccine, when it's going through the regulatory process, the most expensive and time-consuming component of testing is actually clinical trials,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these vaccines they're going to have to pass on those costs associated with that clinical trial back onto the consumer to recover those costs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said these additional costs could lead to companies producing fewer vaccines, which could mean less availability here in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they work out their profit margins are not going to be significant enough to produce more vaccines, it would potentially affect the supply chain in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven like any business and are working in the best interest of shareholders.\"\n\n\n\nCould the same thing happen in Australia?\n\nGriffin was confident a similar decision would not be made by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which is responsible for regulating medicines in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really doubt that the TGA will because they're a tremendously reputable regulatory body and they do engage a lot of genuine expertise to make the recommendations that they do,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, politicians and public sentiment can erode confidence in vaccines, which can affect the uptake of vaccinations and not just COVID-19 boosters, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fear that I have is that people, the public and certain politicians are already aligning with some of those concerning things that are happening abroad, including in the US, and may call for these sorts of things to happen and further undermine their confidence in vaccines,\" he said.\n\n\n\nGriffin said a particularly worrying trend is the decline in childhood vaccinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2024 report from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance found that children aged from 12 months to 5 years old were less vaccinated in 2023 than in 2020.\n\n\n\nWhat does the TGA say?\n\nA spokesperson for TGA said it was independent of FDA influences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While the TGA does work closely with international counterparts, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), the TGA independently reviews the data and makes its own decision based on the evidence provided by the sponsor, and within the Australian context,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson also said TGA does not conduct clinical trials and is \"unable to compel a sponsor or manufacturer of a medicine to conduct a clinical trial\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said access to COVID-19 boosters will \"remain free in 2025\" for eligible Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Government will continue to consider future arrangements supporting the access, supply and distribution for COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from Reuters news agency.\n\n\n\n",

Yesterday, we managed to get baby formula and other nutrition supplies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 100 aid lorries have so far been permitted to enter Gaza, with dozens more trucks waiting for the green light in northern Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the UN says aid workers have been unable to bring the items to distribution points where it's most needed, because the Israeli military forced them to reload the supplies onto separate trucks, and workers ran out of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd United Nations Childrens Fund spokesperson Tess Ingram says not enough is coming anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says at least 500 trucks of aid and commercial goods are needed on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlmost all the essential items that children need are missing at the moment because stocks that were replenished during the ceasefire have run down. Almost all essential items have run out. And the trucks that have been announced to enter this week are a drop in the ocean compared to the need. So it is essential that aid is scaled up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aid blockade was introduced because Israel accused Hamas of diverting the aid for its own use, a charge the militant group has denied.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN and aid organisations say the blockade has worsened what they say is a rapidly deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN says it's worried that 14,000 babies are at risk of death from starvation within the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nUK surgeon Dr Tom Potokar with the International Red Cross has echoed those concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What can you say? I mean it's horrific. Gaza has become a slaughterhouse... There's so little stuff getting in. There's no food getting in so people are starving. There's very little medical supplies coming in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite such criticism, Chief of Israel's General Staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir says the IDF remains determined to intensify its operations against Hamas, 20 months after the group's deadly raid on October 7.\n\n\n\n\n\nHEBREW THEN ENGLISH VO: \"I, together with all IDF soldiers, will continue to act tirelessly until the release of all our hostages. We will seize every possible opportunity. Hamas must understand \u2014 there is a price for its actions, and the only way to secure the release of the hostages is to release them. If an agreement is reached, the IDF will adjust its operations accordingly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also says Israel has no intention of stopping until its goal to defeat Hamas is achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says strict controls on the distribution of aid remains part of that plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHEBREW THEN ENGLISH VO: \"Eventually reaching a situation where we have an area that is entirely controlled by the IDF and the entire civilian population of Gaza can get there and receive the aid and Hamas receives nothing. This is part of defeating Hamas... This is the war and victory plan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCeasefire negotiations have been quietly proceeding in Qatar while these operations continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani say mediators have been unable to broker a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a fundamental gap between the two parties, which is: one party is looking for a partial deal that might or have the possibility to lead to a comprehensive deal and the other party is looking just for one-off deal, and to end the war and to get all the hostages out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, international pressure to resolve the crisis keeps coming.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Casper Veldkamp is among a group of European leaders who say that their patience for Israel's tactics is wearing thin because of the mounting famine concerns in the enclave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know Mrs. von der Leyen is a friend of Israel, and I consider myself a friend of Israel too. I believe that also Mrs. von de Leyen sees it as very important that Europe gives a clear signal to Israel now about the concern that we're having in Europe, also in our societies and politics, about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the intensified Israeli war effort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSweden is of a similar view.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts top diplomat says the country is working within the EU to push for sanctions against certain Israeli ministers over Israel's treatment of civilian Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas says a strong majority of the 27 member states at a foreign ministers' meeting have backed a review of its cooperation deal with Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pressure is necessary to change the situation... So we will launch this exercise. And in the meantime, it is up to Israel to unblock the humanitarian aid.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the UK, Foreign Secretary David Lammy has announced sanctions and the suspension of free trade talks with Israel - and he has summoned Israeli's ambassador to the UK for a dressing down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The two state solution remains the ideal framework - indeed, the only framework for a just and lasting peace. But as the House knows, its very viability is in peril, endangered not only by the war in Gaza, but by the spread of illegal Israeli settlements and outposts across the occupied West Bank, with the explicit support of this Israeli government. There are now weekly meetings to improve new settlement construction, settlement approval has accelerated while settler violence has soared.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Mortgage holders could be waiting until September to see a reduction in their home loan repayment rates as some economists predict the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will not make a further cut at its next meeting in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA reduced the cash rate target by 0.25 per cent on Tuesday , taking the key interest rate down to 3.85 per cent following what it described as a healthy reduction in inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nRBA governor Michele Bullock said the board had considered a 0.50 per cent cut before reaching consensus on the 0.25 per cent reduction to the cash rate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Does it mean we're headed into a long series of interest rate cuts? I don't know at this point,\" she said on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe described the 0.25 per cent cut as \"cautious\", adding that it came \"with a recognition that if we need to move quickly, we can. We have got space.\"\n\n\n\nHow interest rates have risen and fallen in Australia\n\nWhat do economists make of the decision?\n\nBetashares chief economist David Bassanese said Bullock's explanation suggested the RBA was not \"seriously considering\" not cutting interest rates on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That tells me that a rate cut was definitely on the table. The only question was the size,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's an element of stability that's returned to markets. Recession fears have eased, and so they don't need a big cut of 0.5 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe flagged that trimmed mean inflation, one of the board's most valued economic indicators, was within its target range of 2\u20133 per cent and sat at 2.9 per cent in the most recent March quarter data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA is forecasting inflation will go to 2.6 per cent, so if that's what happens, then they can take rates back to normal, which I think is below three per cent, he said.\n\n\n\nRSM Australia economist Devika Shivadekar said the reduction was \"welcome news\" for businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Financing has been quite restrictive, and given low productivity, businesses would have been struggling. Even though inflation was going down, costs have been higher,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe described trimmed mean inflation as consistently reducing, which could underpin further rate cut decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA's next opportunity to cut rates is at its 8 July meeting, but some economists say that's too soon for a cut, with a reduction more likely at its August meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a rate cut, it can take at least a month to see your loan payments reduce, and some banks do not automatically pass on the savings.\n\n\n\nWhen will the RBA cut rates again?\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver said there was a 50 per cent chance there could be a cut in July but the most likely scenario was that the RBA would keep the rate on hold at 3.85 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our base case is for 0.25 per cent cuts in each of August, November and February, taking the cash rate to 3.1 per cent,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBassanese also predicted the same reductions in August and November, anticipating \"one more rate cut next year\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShivadekar anticipated a 0.25 per cut each quarter of 2025 and had correctly forecast a cut in February and May this year.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Looking forward, she also predicted 0.25 per cent cuts in August and November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That would leave the cash rate at 3.35 per cent at the end of the year. Looking to next year, the RBA will have a lot to consider domestically and globally,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey quarterly inflation data for the June quarter will only be released after the board's July meeting, meaning the RBA could hold the rate until August, when it has access to that important data.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the decision to change the cash rate target is ultimately up to Bullock and her board.\n\n\n\nWhat to watch in the meantime?\n\nOliver flagged a number of upcoming domestic data releases that would weigh into the RBA's decision-making, as well as news from overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Key data points to watch ahead of the July meeting are the monthly inflation readings next week and in late June, growth in household spending, jobs data, and developments regarding [US President] Donald Trump's tariffs, which risk ramping up again ,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the three economists agreed that quarterly inflation data, due to be released 30 July and 29 October, were the most critical to managing Australia's economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nShivadekar also flagged that \"soft\" data, like consumer confidence, would also be key.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Within the 90-day pause in the wider tit-for-tat tariff war between the US and China, however, the tariff rate was reduced to 54 per cent, with the $US100 flat fee remaining. The US actions caused Shein and Temu to increase their prices to US consumers and to rethink their business models, diversifying their supply chains to source products from countries facing lower tariffs and, in Temu\u2019s case, halting its direct shipping model and scrambling to find US suppliers. Even without Trump\u2019s aggressive trade war on everyone the rest of the world has been starting to consider how to avoid being overwhelmed by the threatened flood of cheap products. Credit: Bloomberg The fear elsewhere is that they would seek to compensate for lower US sales by stepping up their marketing and supply to other economies. In Europe, the European Union has proposed levying a flat fee of \u20ac2 ($A3.50) per parcel on small packages. Europe is already a major and fast-growing destination for low-value exports from China, with 4.6 billion parcels attracting de minimus status last year, 90 per cent of them from China.\n\nThat was about twice the volume experienced in 2023 and, indeed, a far greater volume than that experienced by the US, where about 1.2 billion packages \u2013 some Congressional estimates are far higher -- originated from within China and Hong Kong last year. (It is difficult to be precise about the volumes because there is so little data collected on the volume and nature of those parcels). Loading The EU\u2019s draft proposal says the new fee will apply to parcels sent directly to consumers. If they are sent to a warehouse, they would attract a fee of only \u20ac0.50. It is easier, and less costly, to process goods and collect revenue from a warehouse than it is from individual parcels at the border. The de minimus exemptions common to most advanced economies reflect the cost and complexity of imposing and collecting revenue from small parcel imports, indeed that was the original rationale for the exemption which, in the US, dates back to 1938. With the costs and effort of applying and collecting duties seen as greater than the revenue that might be raised, the parcels were regarded as too insignificant to bother about \u2013 until the volumes began soaring in the past few years.\n\nThe European approach is essentially designed to recover those costs of administering the regime rather than the revenue-raising, imports-deterring tariffs approach favoured by the US. Japan has convened a panel of tax experts to consider removing its exemption from duties for parcels worth less than 10,000 yen ($108). It is contemplating applying its sales tax \u2013 around 10 per cent \u2013 to small parcels. It\u2019s not just the use of what has been exploited as a loophole in tariff and duty arrangements by mainly Chinse exporters that is concerning legislators. Small parcel imports, which aren\u2019t inspected, have become a route for illegal drug imports, counterfeit goods and products that don\u2019t meet the receiving countries\u2019 safety standards. The topic of how to respond to a prospective increase in what is already a flood of low-value exports from China was even raised at this week\u2019s G7 meeting of the finance ministers in Canada Credit: AP There\u2019s also a concern about the impact the rapidly-growing influx of cheap products from China (and some very sophisticated circumvention of local sales and income tax regimes) is having on domestic manufacturers and retailers.\n\nIn the US, even the retail behemoth Amazon was so concerned about the impact of Shein and Temu on its business that it copied them and set up its own direct-to-consumer model, shipping directly from warehouses in China to US consumers. Shein and Temu are the most visible, and largest, of China\u2019s small parcel exporters, so the walls that are being erected to slow or halt their tide of cheap products threaten their businesses. They are not, of course, the only Chinese companies that have been exploiting the de minimum loophole and it\u2019s not just that exemption that is causing concern in other economies. With China\u2019s domestic economy stuttering and domestic demand weak, its factories have been deploying their significant excess capacity into export markets. Even as the volume of exports has surged, export prices have been falling. That tide of cheap exports \u2013 factory-gate prices have been sliding steadily for more than two years \u2013 some of them from industries subsidised, directly or indirectly, by various levels of China\u2019s governments, is seen as a threat to advanced economies and their domestic manufacturers.\n\nEven without Trump\u2019s aggressive trade war on everyone \u2013 which threatens to divert China\u2019s exports to the US to other markets, particularly Europe \u2013 the rest of the world has been starting to consider how to avoid being overwhelmed by the threatened flood of cheap products. They want to avoid the experience of the 1990s, when the initial impact of China\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s manufacturing base wiped out large swathes of western industry and jobs. Shein and Temu are the most visible, and largest, of China\u2019s small parcel exporters, so the walls that are being erected to slow or halt their tide of cheap products threaten their businesses. China\u2019s manufacturing base is now far larger \u2013 its share of global manufacturing output is above 30 per cent \u2013 and it now produces and exports goods of higher value and in more strategic sectors than it did in the 1990s. Unrestricted imports from China would do considerable domestic economic damage to the rest of the world. Those exports exploiting the de minimum exemption are, therefore, elements within a larger picture but, given their sheer volume and startling growth rates, not insignificant ones.",

Wayne Taylor Previous Slide Next Slide Japanese$$$$ Is too much matcha ever enough? Not at Sana, where matcha outsells coffee. Open since February, Sana is drawing customers from an hour away for social-media-famous matcha drinks and Asian-inspired brunches. But you don\u2019t need to trawl TikTok: I\u2019ve got the lowdown. Sana is a destination cafe, at least in the sense that you would never stumble upon it, here on the light-industrial fringe of a low-rise housing estate with kid-friendly cul-de-sacs. Even though we\u2019re in Cheltenham, 20 kilometres south of the city, parking is tricky. During the week you\u2019ll be more likely to find a spot for the car and a seat in the cafe, either in the sheltered front porch or inside, where tables are arranged around a central drinks station as busy with matcha-whisking as milk-steaming. Related Article From udon carbonara to a hot-choc haven: Five new cafes to try (and what to order)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything is light, bright and fresh, chic rather than cosy, with whitewashed bricks, concrete flooring and tiles in shades of pink. (I visited with a friend who uses a wheelchair. The toilets in the cafe aren\u2019t accessible, but there are disabled facilities in the adjoining foyer.) Banana milk matcha, a trending Korean drink. Wayne Taylor Matcha is a finely ground powder made from shade-grown green tea leaves, hand-picked only in spring, then steamed and slowly ground to an iridescent sprinkle. Whisked, poured and served according to protocols with roots in Zen Buddhism, matcha is the traditional beverage in Japanese tea ceremonies. In a Kyoto temple, matcha is usually sipped in its simplest form, combined with hot water using a bamboo whisk. In fashionable cafes in Melbourne, it\u2019s served hot, cold, layered, foamed and baked into desserts. The best matcha tastes grassy, rounded and deep, astringent but not too bitter. At Sana, the matcha latte is a good example of the genre. Some cafes use pre-batched matcha cordial, but they hand-whisk to order here. Matcha is also mixed with \u201cbanana milk\u201d, an on-trend Korean beverage that sits as a pleasant, mild backdrop for the tea. Need more? Whisper to the waiter that you want the secret menu, and you\u2019ll have nine more matcha drinks to choose from: iced matcha with Earl Grey is a good place to start. Sana\u2019s owner Steve Chrun moved from Sydney to Melbourne so his wife could be closer to her family. Up north, the former finance guy launched popular cafes Celsius in Kirribilli (now sold) and Cafe Monstera in Mosman Bay (still in the stable). They\u2019re both waterfront cafes with contemporary eggs \u2018n\u2019 extras menus. Sana is different, with views of townhouses rather than bobbing yachts and more of a Japanese culinary angle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUdon carbonara. Wayne Taylor Udon carbonara is an Asian fusion staple; this is a smart rendition, the chewy, cheese-scattered noodles served alongside soy-glazed thick-cut bacon, oozy egg yolk and a little dashi broth, which helps smooth the flavours and lighten the dish. Avocado toast is a cheery pile of lightly charred avo (smoky, but not warm or gross), spicy hummus and wasabi \u201cgranola\u201d (grains stirred with blitzed wasabi peas, which is a clever touch). The same granola base, this time mixed with cocoa rather than peas, is scattered over an acai bowl which amps up the colour and flavours with tropical fruit and a fudgy square of brownie. As winter hits, look for hot waffles instead of chilly acai. Wagyu mince is turned into a spiced pattie, crumbed, fried and splodged with curry pickle mayo for the milk-loaf sandwich. Tapping into trends and hype can feel cynical, but Sana is more about joy, fun and a sincere welcome. Yes, there\u2019s a not-so-secret menu, but the real secret to Sana\u2019s success is that Chrun and his team are still surprised and grateful that people are seeking out the place: if you whisk it, they will come. Three more matcha specialists to try Matcha Kobo This new city spot stone-mills matcha then whisks it to order for specialty hot and cold drinks. There\u2019s table seating, but you can really channel Kyoto by sitting cross-legged on cushions in the faux temple area.

        "text": "Those theories - that he could quit - have been put to bed by the man himself, and firmly. He says his work isn\u2019t done and that he\u2019ll be disappointed if he is asked to stop. He\u2019s been fighting publicly for the club through weeks and months of doubt and hate from his own supporters, and he wants to see this thing through. He has shown his players, as he put it, how to \u201cclimb a mountain\u201d, and now the next one they scale should be a little easier. \u201cI still feel there\u2019s a lot of work to be done \u2026 but not as much work as people may think,\u201d he said. \u201cI really feel that tonight can be a great platform for us to kick on.\u201d So now it\u2019s over to chairman Daniel Levy. Surely, there is no way he could sack him now. It would be the stupidest thing he could possibly do. It would no doubt trigger a revolt from the players, and then an exodus, and then send the worst possible message to whoever his replacement is: even achieving the extraordinary isn\u2019t enough at Tottenham Hotspur. Ange Postecoglou and Daniel Levy. Credit: Getty Images Look at the way the players celebrated - not only with each other, not only with Postecoglou, but about Postecoglou. He lurked off to the side when they did their initial trophy lift, rebuffed their first invitation to join them, and then was reluctantly dragged into the middle of the pack. Afterwards, the injured James Maddison and Sergio Regulion - banished to less than a bit-part role under the coach and surely bound for the exit in the summer, which means he has every reason to hold a grudge if he wanted to - held up a banner brought in by fans which showed Postecoglou holding the Europa League trophy, wearing those meme \u2018thug life\u2019 sunglasses, and the declaration for which he is now globally famous: \u201cI don\u2019t usually win things, I ALWAYS win things in my second year.\u201d\n\nMaddison posted that line again on X a little later, still marvelling at his boss\u2019s boldness. \u201cBruhhhhhhhh,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the former England international Micah Richards on the TNT Sports coverage could barely contain himself, yelling at Postecoglou: \u201cHOW DOES THAT FEEL? COME ON! I\u2019VE BEEN BACKING YOU ALL SEASON, I LOVE YOUR FOOTBALL, YOU\u2019VE HAD YOUR INJURIES, YOUNG PLAYERS, BUT YOU DID IT TONIGHT!\u201d His response? \u201cI can\u2019t say the same for everyone on the panel,\u201d noting the presence of Jamie Carragher, one of his biggest critics. Postecoglou had another little jab for Levy in his presser, again demonstrating his elephant-like memory. Not long after he was appointed, Levy acknowledged in a fan forum that Spurs had erred in the past by going for \u201ctrophy managers\u201d, or win-now guys like Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or Antonio Conte, whose philosophies didn\u2019t align with the club\u2019s DNA. Postecoglou, of course, was a perfect match - but the inference was that he wasn\u2019t a \u201ctrophy manager\u201d.\n\nHe always was, and he is again. \u201cEven Daniel sort of said: \u2018we went after winners, it didn\u2019t work, and now we\u2019ve got Ange.\u2019 Mate, I\u2019m a winner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a serial winner my whole career. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done more than anything else. I know people talk about my football, which I\u2019m very proud of \u2026 and I know people dismiss my achievements because they didn\u2019t happen on this side of the world. But for me, they\u2019re all hard-earned, and all I\u2019ve done my whole career is win things.\u201d There is an irony, though. Postecoglou won this trophy not through classic Angeball but through Mourinho-like grit, and long periods of Conte-style suffering. Spurs had only 27.7 per cent of possession and completed just 115 passes for the whole match - the lowest such figures Opta has recorded by any team in a major European final.\n\nLoading The goal they scored, on the stroke of half-time, was fittingly ugly - albeit, generated by a beautiful cross from Pape Matar Sarr which spotted a great run from Brennan Johnson, but he hardly connected with it, and the ball went in off Luke Shaw and past the turnstile arms of Andre Onana. Johnson was credited with it in the end, and he deserved the moment; in September he deactivated his social media accounts amid a deluge of abuse from Tottenham fans who couldn\u2019t see the things he brought to the team, the things that Postecoglou could see. That was his 17th goal for the season. He is their top-scorer. Maybe now they can see. From then on, it was about getting in the trenches. They said Postecoglou and this group of players couldn\u2019t defend. Didn\u2019t know how. They were wrong - although it helped that United, in turn, couldn\u2019t attack. Postecoglou chalked up his marked tactical change in the Europa League to the demands of knockout football. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of success in my career in not just winning leagues, but in Australia, I grew up playing finals football to win a championship,\u201d he said. \u201cKnockout football is always different. All my teams have always played a little bit different in knockout games \u2026 big games come down to moments. You\u2019ve got to limit the moments of the opposition.\u201d It\u2019s true, but not the whole truth. Even in cut-throat moments, Postecoglou\u2019s teams have never been so direct or defensively minded.\n\nBut, honestly, who cares? The most important thing was that they got the monkey off their back. Now all the self-defeating \u2018Spursy\u2019 talk can stop, and they can chart a course forward - ideally playing some sort of synthesis between the mesmerising attacking stuff Postecoglou has dedicated his career to, and the solidity and flexibility displayed in the Europa League. Loading Later this week, Postecoglou and his team will be lauded in north London with an open-top bus parade with their new silverware. After that, they host Brighton & Hove Albion in their final Premier League fixture. After that, there are no planned meetings between Levy and Postecoglou - not yet, anyway. \u201cMaybe they felt like they don\u2019t need to, or they\u2019re waiting for this game,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, what I do know is that I\u2019m going to go back to my hotel room, get my family and friends together, open up a nice bottle of scotch, have a couple of quiet ones \u2026 and then Monday I\u2019m going on holidays with my beautiful family because I deserve it.",

        "text": "The 707 was Australia\u2019s VIP jetliner, but it had seen better days. The little fleet of 707s came from the late 1950s/early \u201960s era when rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and V8 hot rods ruled and noise pollution wasn\u2019t a problem. By the time Keating was PM, the RAAF had to beg permission to land the 707 at many international airports because its two old engines made such a racket, even after they were fitted with exhaust baffles. In 1992, when Keating made an official visit to Tokyo, the Japanese politely explained its international airport, Narita, wasn\u2019t suitable. Paul Keating\u2019s plan for a two new prime ministerial planes was grounded in 1993. Credit: Getty Images They directed the RAAF to land at Tokyo\u2019s domestic airport, which presumably had vintage spanner sets for elderly airframes if the plane broke down.\n\nIt was humiliating for a prime minister like Keating, whom cartoonists cruelly drew as the modern embodiment of the extravagantly self-absorbed Sun King, France\u2019s Louis XIV. I had by then spent happy years flying around the world in the old 707s as part of the press gallery pack. We called it the Zoo Plane. Wine of fine vintage and high jinks of great silliness flowed freely in the media cabin down the back. Until Keating became PM, Bob Hawke smoked cigars and played poker in his suite at the front. It was a most agreeable way to travel the world. But then, in mid-1993, not long after Keating unexpectedly won the federal election against John Hewson, word floated my way through Canberra\u2019s rarefied air that the triumphant PM was on the lookout for a new VIP plane. Two, in fact.\n\nQuiet conversations confirmed Keating\u2019s desire for more-fitting VIP airborne transport, but that his department was on a collision course with the Defence Department, which was worried about the cost. The two planes being considered were Boeing 757s. They weren\u2019t flown by any airline in Australia, but they were big and modern and desirable. And expensive. Tony Wright\u2019s story on Paul Keating\u2019s jet plans in The Sydney Morning Herald, June 16, 1993. Credit: When my story was published in The Sydney Morning Herald, all hell broke loose. The public went into a mild uproar, Keating\u2019s Labor colleagues went weak at the knees, and I, as the messenger, got a number of shouty phone calls from offices not too far from the prime minister\u2019s own parliamentary suite.\n\nEven Keating suddenly found himself unwilling to test the generosity of voters, many of whom were still recovering from what he had called, only three years previously, \u201cthe recession we had to have\u201d. The story killed the planned purchase of new VIP planes stone dead. Keating was still flying around in the ancient 707s three years later when he lost the prime ministership to John Howard. I was not allowed to forget it. Every time I stepped aboard the 707 for a trip overseas, I was reminded by Keating\u2019s staff that if the plane fell out of the sky, I was to blame for writing \u201cthat bloody story\u201d.\n\nLoading Press gallery colleagues, unhappy at being scooped, took up the sledging with glee. And Keating continued to yearn for a plane more suited to a prime minister of style. In 1995, on a trip to Germany, no sooner had we landed in Bonn than the poor unloved 707 was rolled into a darkened hangar and Keating proceeded to Berlin in a magnificently appointed Airbus lent to him by chancellor Helmut Kohl. Some among the travelling media declared Keating looked green each time he emerged from the Airbus\u2019 VIP suite with its gold appointments in the bathroom, its conference room and its super-modern communications.\n\nI felt a bit sympathetic. It wasn\u2019t unusual for fittings in the ancient 707s to judder loose. I once copped a thump to the head when an internal ceiling panel fell out. Keating was correct. The VIP fleet desperately needed replacements. John Howard eventually got a Boeing Business Jet that was (conveniently) too small to accommodate travelling journalists. The current fleet consists of two Boeing 737s, ordered by Scott Morrison\u2019s government and used these days by Anthony Albanese, the governor-general and others. The point, however, was that a prime minister in Australia\u2019s political system could not unilaterally choose the style of VIP plane available to him or her. Australia pays for its own perquisites, which are decided by federal departments like Defence and Prime Minister and Cabinet, which have rules and budgets.\n\nIt is unimaginable that an Australian prime minister would consider accepting a jumbo jet-sized bribe from a foreign country. Loading All senators and members of the House of Representatives are required to list their pecuniary interests in a register. The allowable limit for gifts from another government is $750, and from individuals it is $300. A $600 million jet would appear mighty peculiar in any list of pecuniary interests. Anywhere, really, outside Trump\u2019s morally warped Washington.",

        "text": "At Gairlochy, the first lock north of Neptune\u2019s Staircase, we rendezvous with the barge after two hours of walking. With the locks along the canal closing each evening, halting all boat traffic, we moor below the gates in motionless wait for morning. The shores of Loch Lochy are just beyond, and the only sounds to reach us are from within \u2013 the movement of our six passengers and three crew, and the welcome clatter of Mike, the Fingal\u2019s chef, at work in the open galley. A pattern soon settles over the days, with walks each morning and afternoon, returning to the Fingal for lunches of soup and barge-baked bread and baguettes. As the barge squeezes into Gairlochy\u2019s locks after breakfast the next morning, its 180 tonnes rising on an elevator of water, we continue hiking along the GGW. Along the southern shores of Loch Lochy, the Way is at its most beautiful, framed by mountains and winding through forest so green even the light seems tinged with colour. It was on these shores that Allied troops trained for the D-Day landings in 1945, and here that Achnacarry, the ancestral estate of the Clan Cameron chiefs, sprawls across an isthmus between Loch Lochy and Loch Arkaig. The GGW marches blindly past Achnacarry, but we turn up a hidden path beside a village church to enter the estate. Looking over green fields and sheep to its Scottish Baronial castle, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve stepped into every British period drama ever filmed. Sunrise over Achnacarry and Loch Lochy near Fort William. Credit: iStock Alongside the castle there\u2019s a clan museum, but we\u2019re bound for the Dark Mile at the estate\u2019s far end. Though it sounds like something from a Stephen King novel, the Dark Mile looks more like something from a fairy tale \u2013 a mile-long country lane where the drystone walls and the roadside trees and earth are inches thick in moss. Through this cushioned landscape we return to the loch, where the barge\u2019s tender awaits us, one of our longest walking days done after just 11 kilometres.\n\nThe presence of the barge allows us this kind of ease that\u2019s uncommon on long-distance trails. Along the canal, we simply step off the barge directly onto the paths. On the lochs, the tender ferries us to and from the shores. Walking along the foot of Ben Nevis, Britain\u2019s highest peak. Credit: iStock Once aboard, one half of the barge is a communal space of couches, an honesty bar of local whiskies and craft beers, an extensive library and a large dining table for meals \u2013 from ox-cheek broth to Balmoral chicken stuffed with haggis \u2013 that we share with the crew. At Laggan Locks, at the head of Loch Lochy, the Caledonian Canal performs its greatest trick. So much of the canal was built beside rivers, but here it needed to cross a low hill that rose as a watershed within the Great Glen. It was the final section of the canal to be constructed \u2013 a two-kilometre-long hurdle \u2013 but it took 500 workers seven years to complete. Known today as Laggan Avenue, it\u2019s a section that\u2019s wasted on walkers, with the canal obscured by trees, so we remain aboard as the Fingal motors on from the locks. For half an hour, it feels more like an Amazon cruise than a Scottish walking trip, with a jungle-like strip of forest reaching down to and over the canal.\n\n\u201cThis is totally different to any canal I\u2019ve ever been on,\u201d says skipper Adam Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite part of the canal.\u201d Soon, the canal widens again into Loch Oich and finally Loch Ness, Scotland\u2019s most famous body of water. Its dimensions are as monstrous as its myths \u2013 containing more water than all the lakes and rivers in England and Wales combined, it\u2019s up to 300 metres deep, giving it a sense of mystery that fuelled the legend of Nessie. Canal and boat lift connecting Loch Ness at Fort Augustus. Credit: iStock We continue to use the water as a diving board into a host of trails \u2013 walks to waterfalls, over low hills, through blueberry-carpeted forests and eventually to the Caledonian Canal\u2019s end at the Moray Firth. In Loch Ness, we moor by a pier in Foyers, on the loch\u2019s quieter and wilder eastern side, where we\u2019ve watched goats grazing at the water\u2019s edge and been circled by a sea eagle \u2013 the largest bird in the UK. But the best comes in the calm of dawn as I take my coffee up onto the deck of the barge.\n\nLess than 100 metres ahead of us, a stream pours into the loch through a green glow of forest. As I watch, two deer step out of the trees and into Loch Ness. As they dip their heads to drink, not a single other thing around the loch seems to move. Loading Far across the water, on the path proper for the GGW, there will be hikers now stirring, packing up tents or already on the move. But here, I\u2019m in no hurry. We will soon sail towards Inverness and the trip\u2019s end but, for the moment, I have the most beautiful and natural of company.

        "text": "Ghost camping has been reported across the country and was a key factor in the Victorian government's decision not to renew its free camping initiative.\n\nFree camping will not be renewed in Victoria in July, it's been announced. Source: Parks Victoria\n\nIt was billed as a cost-of-living measure aimed at making holidaying domestically more affordable for Aussie families, but free camping in Victoria will not be renewed in July after the initiative was found to be of \"no benefit\" to regional communities and the local tourism economy.\n\nOriginally announced in October 2024, the state government scheme made camping free at all sites across Victoria. However it's since been plagued by issues, namely ghosting camping \u2014 a growing issue reported at campgrounds across the country \u2014 and by complaints of illegal rubbish dumping.\n\nNationals member for eastern Victoria, Melina Bath, whose electorate includes national park land has even branded the free camping initiative \"systematically flawed\" and said it \"had been a disaster on a number of levels\". Meanwhile national parks authorities have backed the end of free camping and endorsed a move towards a 50 per cent reduction in booking fees.\n\nA camper who attended the Jamieson Creek Campground along the Great Ocean Road in Victoria in April said he was shocked to find it totally vacant, despite claiming it was fully booked on the Parks Victoria online booking system. \"It was really strange as I was expecting it to be full... the only resident there was a wallaby in a fire pit eating someone's leftovers,\" camper Ross Edwards told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nGhost camping has seen prime spots around Victoria left vacant. Source: Tim Bull\n\nWhy didn't free camping quite work in Victoria?\n\nIndustry experts say the main problem with the program is the fact it was rolled out without any enforcement. Aussie couple Michelle and her husband Heatley, who own a free camping guide app, criticised the lack of management involved in the free camping policy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"If you\u2019re going to introduce a new policy, then you need to manage it. They can't just put their hands up without an answer [to ghost booking] and say it's not their responsibility,\" they told Yahoo recently. \"There needs to be boots on the ground to have it managed effectively and address ghost bookings. Otherwise, they aren\u2019t achieving the desired outcome at all.\"\n\nCaravan and Residential Parks Victoria chief executive Scott Parker agrees, saying the unfortunate outcome over the summer months was foreseeable.\n\n\"And it was clearly communicated by the association to the government during the policy's implementation,\" he said. \"It was contrary to the principles of the government's own competitive neutrality policy,\" he told the ABC this week as the state government announced the policy would not continue.\n\nVictorian National Parks Association executive director Matt Ruchel also told the national broadcaster that the free camping initiative had created problems for the local industry. \"The fact that people are paying a fee means that they're more likely to turn up,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn this week's budget, the Victorian government announced the reinstatement of half-price camping at Parks Victoria\u2019s 131 paid, government-run campgrounds, running from July through until June 2027.\n\nA camper said there was 'not a soul' at the campground when they arrived.

Three years on, it still faces major hurdles.\n\nAn environmentally conscious shopper celebrated the return of a soft plastics recycling bin in Sydney, but there's a major hurdle blocking the rollout more broadly. Source: Facebook/Clare Donovan/ Getty\n\nAs environmentalists celebrate soft plastic recycling bins returning to some stores, the nation's biggest supermarkets warn there's still \"simply not enough capacity\" in Australia to support full, nationwide collections.\n\nThe Soft Plastics Taskforce \u2014 a coordinated effort by major supermarkets and government bodies to address the crisis in soft plastic recycling \u2014 said it had now launched recycling trials in \"well over 100\" stores across the country, including in Sydney and the Hunter in NSW, and Melbourne.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, it warned the infrastructure is still lagging, something that's limiting its ability to broaden the trial. The announcement comes as keen shoppers rave about the arrival of soft plastic recycling bins at their local outlet, like one in Sydney on Thursday.\n\n\"So happy to see this,\" they said of the new bins at Alexandria in the city's inner-south.\n\nAustralia uses an estimated 70 billion pieces of soft plastics annually. Source: Facebook\n\nWhy is there not enough capacity to broaden soft plastic recycling at supermarkets?\n\nThe Soft Plastics Taskforce was formed after the collapse of REDcycle in 2022, which had collected soft plastics, such as things like bread bags, at supermarkets before shutting down due to stockpiling issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response, major retailers including Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi teamed up with government agencies to create a national recovery plan. The taskforce aims to establish a safe, sustainable collection system, boost local recycling capacity, and rebuild public trust. Trials are underway in select areas, with a focus on long-term solutions to keep soft plastics out of landfill and support Australia\u2019s circular economy.\n\n\"The biggest challenge still remains that there is simply not enough soft plastic recycling capacity in Australia to support full, nationwide collections, so it\u2019s important not to exceed limited local recycling capacity as we work with the broader industry to responsibly rebuild the soft plastic recycling system,\" a Soft Plastics Taskforce spokesperson told Yahoo.\n\nThe Soft Plastics Taskforce was set up in the wake of the REDcycle collapse. Source: Woolworths/Facebook\n\n\"We\u2019re in close contact with soft plastic recyclers as they rebuild and expand their operations, with a number of new recyclers starting to open their doors over the last year. The Taskforce has facilitated an immediate response to processing the stockpiles left behind by REDcycle, while working to restart in-store collections of soft plastic packaging for recycling.\n\n\"A more permanent, industry-wide soft plastics stewardship program is currently in the works to bring together all manufacturers and retailers who generate household soft plastics and continue to grow recycling collections.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the Taskforce, collection is not currently feasible in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, or Tasmania due to the lack of local recycling facilities. Participating supermarkets do not own recycling plants \u2014 instead, they work with specialised third-party recyclers and are helping to accelerate the development of new facilities.\n\nColes, Woolworths, Aldi reveal fate of 11,000 tonnes of soft plastics\n\nWhen the supermarket-facilitated REDcycle collapsed in 2022, Australia was left without a soft plastic recycling scheme. It was also revealed that 11,000 tonnes of material customers dutifully dropped into bins provided by Coles and Woolworths had been hidden away by REDcycle instead of being recycled.\n\nWhen Yahoo News checked in with the Taskforce in July last year, things were looking grim. It admitted to being \"disappointed\" that the majority of the soft plastics were still in storage.\n\nBut less than a year on, we can reveal the group is making progress and the 11,000 tonne stockpile has been halved to 5,500 tonnes.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
