        "text": "An artificial intelligence injection that's been dubbed the biggest change to Google Search in years is coming to Australia , allowing users to ask more complex questions.\n\nThe search giant this morning announced it would be rolling out AI Mode, its \"most powerful AI search experience yet\", in Australia and more than 40 other countries this week.\n\nIt's just one small tab on your computer or smartphone search page but the company says it will make a big difference to search, offering something that's different to both traditional internet scouring and new chat-based AI tools.\n\nAn artificial intelligence injection that's been dubbed the biggest change to Google Search in years is coming to Australia, allowing users to ask more complex questions. (Google)\n\nVice president of product management Hema Budaraju said Australian users would start seeing a new tab called AI Mode alongside their standard search options.\n\n\"Once you click into that, you should be able to ask any question, literally any question on your mind, and then receive a predictable AI response that has got many ways to engage with the web, as well as the ability to ask a follow-up,\" she told 9News.\n\nShe used examples such as figuring out which clubs someone just starting out in golf should buy or how to handle a weird error message thrown up by a washing machine.\n\n\"How might you be able to just take a picture of that and ask, 'Hey, is this a normal error? What should I do? Can I fix this by myself? Do I need to call technician?',\" she said.\n\n\"Now, remember in a world where it was very keyword driven, this would have been many, many searches and hours of agony, and now you can literally just take a picture and ask for information.\"\n\nAI Mode uses what Google calls a query fan-out, meaning it analyses your natural-language or image query and breaks it off into many different queries that it knits back into an answer the company says can be both broader and deeper than a traditional search, but still accompanied by links.\n\nGoogle vice president of product management Hema Budaraju. (Google)\n\nGoogle gave the example of creating yourself a walking tour around Melbourne to check out specialty coffee shops, galleries and street art, then asking where you could stop for lunch and dinner along the way.\n\nBudaraju said people were \"not looking just for an AI response\" but also wanted to be connected to web results they could use in a \"very intuitive, simple, frictionless manner\".\n\nAI Mode is based on Google's Gemini AI models and real-time information from the search engine and can search using text, voice or photos but users can still opt for traditional searches.\n\nBudaraju said it was distinct from the Gemini chatbot, which she said might offer more creative answers while AI Mode was more focused on finding information.\n\nAI Mode uses what Google calls a query fan-out, meaning it analyses your query and breaks it off into many different queries that it knits back into an answer the company says can be both broader and deeper than a traditional search, but still accompanied by links. (Google)\n\nShe said more than 100 million people in the US and India had used the new search option since it rolled out there earlier this year.\n\nAlthough Google's parent company Alphabet has its finger in everything from online video and email to mobile phones and self-driving cars, Search is its baby, raking in almost $US200 billion ($303 billion) a year.\n\nThat means there's a lot riding on even small changes to a product that's used trillions of times a year by billions of people.\n\nBut Google Search is facing increasing competition from large-language-model AI competitors. According to market research firm SparkToro, Google still powers 210 times more searches than ChatGPT, but the use of LLMs is growing.\n\nAn Apple executive testified earlier this year that Google searches on Apple devices' Safari browser fell for the first time in 20 years.\ufeff\n\nWhile Google says it's put in a lot of work to make the new search feature as accurate as possible, it still warns people to double-check information for important topics.\n\n\"As with any early-stage AI product, we won't always get it right, but we are committed to continuous improvement,\" Budaraju wrote in a blog post published this morning.\n\nThere are also some unanswered questions around electricity and water usage and the impact AI search is having on the web.\n\nThere are also some unanswered questions around electricity and water usage and the impact AI search is having on the web. (Jessica Shapiro/AFR)\n\nIn August this year, Google said the median text-based Gemini query used about 0.00024kWh, eight times more than the commonly cited figure for a normal Google search. But that figure is from 2009 so some researchers suggest it could be much much lower thanks to advancements in computing efficiency.\n\n\"The per-prompt energy impact is equivalent to watching TV for less than nine seconds,\" Google said in a blog post.\n\n\"At the same time, our AI systems are becoming more efficient through research innovations and software and hardware efficiency improvements.\n\n\"For example, over a recent 12 month period, the energy and total carbon footprint of the median Gemini Apps text prompt dropped by 33x and 44x, respectively, all while delivering higher quality responses.\"\n\nIt's unclear how much AI Mode uses compared to a normal search or a Gemini prompt.\n\nIn terms of the web, many online publishers have reported seeing their traffic drop alongside the introduction of Google's AI Overviews, raising the spectre of a \"Google zero\" future where searches no longer send any clicks to the websites that rely on them.\n\nGoogle claims people are \"visiting a greater diversity of websites\" from AI overviews and says the people who click through them are more likely to spend more time on the sites they visit.",

(ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)\n\nA day after Rio's West Angelas announcement, WA's environmental watchdog recommended approving a major expansion to BHP's Jimblebar mine.\n\nThe investment wave comes at an uncertain time for Australia's iron ore industry, with some industry analysts suggesting the region's title as the world's biggest iron ore supplier could be under threat in the longer term.\n\nThose predictions are being driven by a slowdown in China's building industry, and the emergence of new mines in Brazil and Africa, containing higher-grade iron ore deposits than the Pilbara.\n\nBut mining investments consultant Phillip Kirchlechner said the situation was more complicated.\n\n\"There's certainly an argument for increasing production [in the Pilbara] as well,\" he said.\n\n\"China has new pillar industries, wind turbines and electric vehicles for example.\n\n\" China wants to essentially destroy the German car industry \u2026 and so this will constitute, possibly, additional demand for steel in the future that would come out of China. \"\n\nDigging deeper\n\nMr Kirchlechner, who had worked for both Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group, said there was another reason the major miners were looking for new ore deposits.\n\nAfter 60 years of mining, the Pilbara's highest-grade deposits are gone.\n\nPhillip Kirchlechner says companies are digging deeper to access the Pilbara's highest-grade iron ore deposits. (ABC News: Mietta Adams)\n\n\"The low-hanging fruit is already taken, so increasingly you have to mine deeper,\" Mr Kirchlechner said.\n\n\"So there is a scenario of increasing risk as well by having to process the impurities in the iron ore, which are increasing.\"\n\nMine rehabilitation scrutiny grows\n\nAs the footprint of the Pilbara iron ore industry grows, so too does the environmental scrutiny of their operations.\n\nThe WA Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of the Jimblebar expansion included a comment raising concerns about mining rehabilitation.\n\nWhen new mines are approved in WA, the companies must commit to returning the impacted areas into a state as close to their original condition as possible.\n\nBut the EPA report said there was \"limited evidence\" that proponents had successfully rehabilitated areas that had been subject to large-scale mining.\n\nTodd Erickson says new methods were needed to improve mining rehabilitation. (Supplied: Todd Erickson)\n\nThe EPA said it would renew its focus on rehabilitation when assessing future mining proposals.\n\nUniversity of Western Australia senior research fellow Todd Erickson said the commentary was surprising.\n\nThe plant ecologist has helped lead multiple rehabilitation projects with both BHP and Rio Tinto, with some small-scale success.\n\nHe acknowledged the low rates of rehabilitation were \"pretty hard to swallow\".\n\n\"Any mine rehabilitation in a dry hot desert is quite complex, just because of the given environment,\" Dr Erickson said.\n\nRehabilitation includes re-planting natives like the Mulla Mulla in areas cleared for mining operations. (ABC News: Mietta Adams)\n\n\"If mining companies continue to use old practices, they'll most likely get less of a result back.\"\n\nIn a statement, a BHP spokesperson noted the EPA's warning.\n\n\"Last financial year, our WAIO [Western Australian Iron Ore] progressive rehabilitation programme completed more than 1,000 hectares of land rehabilitation, with the majority delivered by Traditional Owner rehabilitation contractors,\" it said.\n\nTo date, 14 per cent of the 149,700 hectares of land disturbed by BHP's mining operations has been rehabilitated.\n\nRio Tinto chose not to comment on the EPA's statement.",

        "text": "Two individual errors have led to Arsenal's Women's Champions League title defence getting off to a losing start in a 2-1 defeat at home to eight-time winners Lyon.\n\nArsenal's Australian trio of Steph Catley, Caitlin Foord and Kyra Cooney-Cross all featured for the hosts, with Catley playing a full game at Meadow Park and fellow Matildas Foord and Cooney-Cross entering as second-half substitutes.\n\nGunners goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar rushed her attempted pass out from the back and picked out Melchie Dumornay just outside her penalty area and the Champions League young player of the year for the last two seasons rolled the ball home at the second attempt.\n\nVan Domselaar also had a hand in the visitors' second in the 23rd minute, although Mariona Caldentey had to shoulder most of the blame.\n\nThe goalkeeper rolled the ball out to the Spain midfielder who turned straight into trouble and lost possession, and when Katie Reid's weak header dropped to Dumornay on the edge of the area she fired home.\n\nThat undid the ideal start given to them by Alessia Russo in only the seventh minute of this repeat of last season's semifinal.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

        "text": "There's a Japanese word that describes your pile of unread books: tsundoku. It dates back to the 1800s but feels especially relevant today \u2014 after all, we're reading less than we used to.\n\nEvery demographic has experienced a decline in reading since 2012, according to data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey.\n\nAnother Deakin University study reveals 29 per cent of Australian teens don't read for fun.\n\nABC Radio National's Top 100 Books of the 21st Century Top 100 Books is Radio National's new annual countdown where we hand over the reins to you to vote for your favourite books. Celebrate the Top 100 with us in a big weekend broadcast on October 18 and 19!\n\nIt's not just an Australian phenomenon: recreational reading is at a 20-year low for Americans, while 40 per cent of Britons haven't finished a book in the past year.\n\nLosing your reading mojo\n\nI knew the slump was bad when an author \u2014 during their memoir-promoting tour, no less \u2014 admitted their reading had tailed off significantly.\n\n\"This is not good material for somebody trying to sell a book,\" they told me.\n\nI can relate: I've gone through reading droughts throughout my life. I was a voracious bookworm when I was younger but as I aged, I found myself reading less and less.\n\nThe pressure to conquer classics and zip through Zeitgeist-capturing books was still there \u2014 without the kid-like luxury of losing myself in chapters for endless hours.\n\nKnowing I wouldn't finish every literary masterpiece written only amplified the anxiety.\n\nI once was so overwhelmed by reading choices, I limited myself to what was released in the past 12 months. Even then, I only finished four books a year.\n\nFreelance journalist Lee Tran Lam listens to audiobooks at 2x speed. (Supplied: Will Reichelt)\n\nOnly during Christmas holidays (when the to-do list was clear) did I speed through reading streaks. It turns out you can finish a book in a day if you literally have nothing else to do.\n\nThese commitment-free conditions are hard to replicate throughout the rest of the year, though. Who has endless days for turning pages when work deadlines surface and bills need paying?\n\nBefore I knew it, I was in another reading slump.\n\nHow to make reading a habit\n\nI broke one such reading drought with Charles Yu's Interior Chinatown in 2020. I breezed through the entire audiobook in one apartment-cleaning afternoon: a 4-hour blitz that recharged my love of novels instantly.\n\nInterior Chinatown is an inspired exploration of Hollywood Asian stereotypes like Kung Fu Guy, Background Oriental Male and Generic Asian Man. It became one of my favourite books of the year (not that there was much competition).\n\nIt was galvanising, too: I could conquer a book in a day and didn't even have to wait until Christmas. I added more audiobooks to my diet.\n\nHow to read more Pick up a book before you pick up your phone in the morning \u2014 even if it's for five minutes\n\nLean into shorter formats like graphic novels and poetry collections\n\nTrack the books you read using an app or a spreadsheet\n\nListen to audiobooks at 1.5x or 2x speed\n\nJoin the library to access free audiobooks and eBooks, as well as old-fashioned paper books\n\nOver time, I've steadily increased my reading volume (even lifting my released-this-year-only restriction) and worked my way through more titles as a result.\n\nI started listing everything I finished in a spreadsheet, a handy reference when friends asked for recommendations. Adding another publication to the \"finished\" column was a satisfying achievement.\n\nOther people prefer book-tracking apps (like StoryGraph or Bookshelf) or triumphantly post completed stacks on Instagram or TikTok.\n\nWith social media's algorithmic pull becoming ever stronger, I try to counteract the empty-calorie sensation of \"feeling too online\" by turning to books instead.\n\nI start each morning with 5 minutes of something, maybe an eBook on my phone or audiobook on my iPad, and flick through pages of a physical volume later in the day.\n\nAnd this year, without trying, I've finished more books than ever in a single year: 63 so far in 2025.\n\nUse your library card\n\nYes, I've turned to short volumes of poetry (Mosab Abu Toha's unshakeable Forest Of Noise) and graphic novels (Venice, Jiro Taniguchi's nostalgic 128-page travel novella).\n\nBut what's truly turbocharged my reading is my library card and its 24/7 access to free apps like Libby and BorrowBox.\n\nMy reading appetite had previously been held back by my book-buying budget (which is much smaller than I'd like), but thanks to the library, I'm now more voracious and adventurous with what I seek out.\n\nMy audiobook-consuming tempo is now a step faster (1.5-2.0 speed at most, fast but not chipmunk-level of unintelligible squeaking).\n\nAnd instead of tuning into another aimless celebrity podcast, I opt for tightly written memoirs (like the Grammy-winning audiobook version of Viola Davis's autobiography Finding Me, elevating her to EGOT status for good reason).\n\nSeptember's best books Photo shows A composite image of eight book covers pictured on a green background Wondering what to read next? This month's best books include the latest from literary giant Ian McEwan and Buckeye, a multigenerational family saga set in America's Midwest.\n\nI love that reading is a passport to experiencing countless new perspectives, from Katie Goh's memoir told through the history of oranges (Foreign Fruit) to Patrick Bringley's life as a New York museum guard (All the Beauty in the World).\n\nThe time pressure of needing to return library books also fast-tracks my reading: I bought Hua Hsu's Stay True in paperback three years ago, but only finished it after checking out the audiobook on BorrowBox in August.\n\nMy reading can sometimes lag (it's taken me four months to read 92 pages of Samantha Harvey's Orbital), but rewiring my doomscrolling reflex has made a difference.\n\nYes, I'm as susceptible to cat memes and viral clips as anyone else, but turning reading into a progressively habitual pastime has led to more completed books.\n\nAnd the pay-off? It only takes one page to be transported elsewhere.\n\nTune into ABC Radio National on October 18 and 19 to listen to the Top 100 Books countdown.",

I'm a giver.\"\n\nKerry Orange didn't know of Staggs' football career, nor had she even watched an NRL game before meeting him.\n\nThrough his generosity, she has come to think of Staggs as a member of the family.\n\n\"In the early, fragile days of grief, when even getting through the day felt impossible, Kotoni quietly became a steady and loving presence,\" Orange said.\n\n\"Without being asked, he stepped into our lives like an uncle to Eylea, offering support in the gentlest, most selfless ways.\n\n\"He gave both of us something I thought we had lost forever: a sense of peace, moments of comfort and even glimpses of joy in the midst of heartbreak.\n\n\"I will be forever grateful for the love and support he's given us.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Staggs credits his late grandmother, Dawn, for instilling his desire to give back to others.\n\nStaggs did not meet his father until his early 20s and was estranged from his mother for parts of his childhood, so Dawn was his guardian growing up in the NSW town of Wellington.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

She did what she did and I turned out to be an all right kid.\"\n\nAs Staggs does his best to carry on Dawn's legacy through acts of kindness, good things have begun to happen.\n\nHe played centre in the Broncos' first grand final win since 2006 on Sunday night and has since earned selection in Kevin Walters' Kangaroos squad for the Ashes tour.\n\n\"I love giving back to people and I love helping out people,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when you do good things, good things come in return.

(Supplied: Nanjing Wool Conference)\n\nMs Neale grew up on a wool farm in Condobolin and is now the founder and creative director of Merino clothing label Intact.\n\nShe said she had always seen great potential for wool beyond traditional knitwear and wanted to ensure consumers continued to find benefit in the homegrown fibre.\n\n\"Future success, in any business, comes from innovation through efficiencies and design,\" Ms Neale said.\n\nRepresentatives of the Australian wool industry at the AWI Future Wool Industry Leaders tour in China.

(Getty Images: Robert Prange)\n\nIga \u015awi\u0105tek enjoyed a 6-1 6-1 rout of Marie Bouzkov\u00e1, but noted that conditions the day prior would have been \"too much for most of the players\".\n\n\"I hope the other matches will be scheduled at a time where girls can compete, rather than just die on the court,\" Swiatek said.\n\nThe ATP said it would consider introducing a formal heat rule, as was the case at the Australian Open and other grand slams.\n\n\"Every player would agree,\" that a heat rule should be implemented, Rune said.\n\nIn a statement, the ATP said player safety was its highest priority and that on-site medical teams monitored the conditions.\n\nDe Minaur focuses on 'surviving'\n\nMeanwhile, seventh-seeded Alex De Minaur defeated Kamil Majchrzak 6-1, 7-5 in humid conditions for his tour-leading 36th win on hard courts this year.\n\nThe 26-year-old broke Majchrzak's serve five times to reach the Masters 1000 fourth round for the seventh time this season.\n\nTwo of the breaks came after he dropped serve to trail 4-3 in the second set.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I came into this week knowing how tough the conditions were going to be,\" De Minaur said.\n\n\"So the mindset, ultimately, is surviving, finding ways and getting ready for battles every time you step out on the court.\n\n\"There is no such thing as easy matches, especially in these conditions, so I'm glad I was able to compose myself in the second set, get the break back, and finish it off in two.\n\n\"If we had gone into a third, it would have been very physical.\"\n\nDe Minaur will next face Nuno Borges, who defeated Shang Juncheng 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-3.\n\nAnother win for De Minaur would see him hit 50 tour-level victories in a season for the first time.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

I think Mr Grunhard can confirm if we were talking to the office about every outage, it would probably be all day. So in this case, we were notified that there had been an outage, and as I said in the statement, within seven minutes that had been resolved. We heard nothing more, until 3.30 the next day from the regulator that there had been a very significant outage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and Singapore have announced an enhanced partnership.\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years on from the start of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two nations, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Singaporean counterpart, Lawrence Wong, have launched a second version of it after meeting in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says it will be based around defence, economic stability, climate change, pandemic preparedness and research into emerging tech.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tasmanian government says the state will suffer immense reputational damage and fail future generations if the proposed AFL stadium on the Hobart waterfront is not built.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state's planning commission's formal report recently recommended against building the stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its formal response to the report, the government says the stadium would create jobs, investment, and long-lasting benefits that cannot be exactly quantified, such as community pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is not bound by the commission's recommendation, but must pass legislation in order to build the stadium, which is forecast to cost more than one billion dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition Labor Party has pledged support for the stadium, but getting the legislation through the upper house is far from certain.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is expected to announce a major taxpayer bailout of a smelter in Queensland, in order to save around 1,100 jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Industry Minister Tim Ayres is expected to make the announcement in Mount Isa, the site of the smelter, owned by Swiss mining giant Glencore.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has threatened to close both the Mount Isa smelter and its Townsville copper refinery, due to running costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt forecast a 2.2 billion dollar loss for the facilities over the next seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Queensland government will contribute to the bailout.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mount Isa smelter contributes about half of Australia's copper smelting facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union is making another appeal to Afghanistan's Taliban government to improve the status of women in the country, as it announces it has provided more than 350 million dollars in humanitarian support.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost international aid to Afghanistan, including that from the U-S, has been suspended since the Taliban re-took power in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardline Islamist Taliban has placed severe restrictions upon women in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark's Minister for European Affairs, Marie Bjerre, has told the European parliament that these need to be lifted to help the delivery of aid to the Afghan people, especially after the recent earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to make the voices of Afghan women heard again. We have heard the critical voices in Afghanistan about the Taliban response to the earthquake, including the lack of female doctors and the need for trained female professionals. We will continue calling on the Taliban to guarantee that all aid workers, including all female staff, can continue their aid delivery and have access to the entire territory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Arsenal's defence of their women's European Champions League title, featuring three Matildas, has started badly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've lost, two goals to one, in London to eight-time champions, French side Lyon.\n\n\n\n",

That's not a complaint, that's actually a good thing - it helps to improve patient outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Dr Ramya Raman, a GP based in Western Australia and the Vice President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer experience of longer and more complicated consultations with patients is at the centre of this year's industry survey, known as the Heart of the Nation report.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found the average appointment time for most GPs has become longer, clocking in at just under 20 minutes - an increase of around a minute that College President Dr Michael Wright says is not surprising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This year some important findings include that 99 per cent of Australians said they could see a GP when they needed to - but what we're seeing is that complexity of care is increasing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Dr Raman's experience suggests, mental health is at the heart of this complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Wright says 71 per cent of GPs have nominated mental health - most commonly anxiety and depression - as a top reason for patient presentations, an increase of ten per cent since the survey began in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are also growing rates of chronic disease and issues that arise as more people get older.\n\n\n\n\n\nGP: \"Morning Nic, please come in. Nice to see you.\n\n\n\n\n\nPATIENT: \"Hello, how are you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGP: \u201cPlease take a seat.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Health of the Nation report says there has been a slight increase in the number of people delaying a visit to the doctor due to the cost of treatment - but there's some good news in the report in terms of being able to find a GP.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile only 12 per cent of GPs say they can afford to bulk-bill all of their patients, the report has found fewer people are waiting longer than what is considered acceptable to see their doctor than in previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Raman says access continues to be important because it can help avoid a much larger crisis down the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When patients are able to see their GP and spend time with their GPs, it actually means that they don't end up in hospital. So best to see their GP rather than walking into the hospital.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's complicated by the nature of the conditions that GPs are confronted with.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Health of the Nation report says 86 per cent of GPs are managing health issues they'd typically expect specialists to treat, with diabetes and cardiovascular issues the two most common for GPs, besides mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent MP Sophie Scamps - herself a former GP - says a lack of access to specialist care means GPs must absorb that demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Scamps says that is significant because prevention and early management is sometimes the best medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that up to 40 per cent of the disease burden in Australia is entirely preventable. And GPs are best placed to be able to provide that preventative care. Yet in Australia we only invest only two per cent of our health budget in prevention, which is far less than other comparable countries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege President Dr Wright offers a familiar prescription to treat these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to fix Medicare funding so that patients can spend more time with their GP when they need to. We know that's important for their health and also for the health of their community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChange is already on the way to address some of the issues in the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's election promise of more funding for bulk-billing is due to come into effect on November the 1st, and there will also be a change to item numbers in Medicare that cover reviews of mental health treatment plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is to streamline consultations and reduce the administrative burden for GPs - but Dr Wright says it's still not enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"General practice is doing amazing things, and we're doing it with the same amount of funding that we've had for the past decade, despite increasing complexity of care, despite increasing administration.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report has also taken a closer look at discrimination, finding almost one third of GPs have witnessed racism towards patients in the health system in the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo in 10 GPs have also personally experienced racism from a patient within their practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Karen Nicholls is the chair of the College's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Council, and says racism can have severe consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It means that patients tend to want to avoid care, and they may not seek help when they need it. It also means that if they're anticipating they might experience racism from their health care provider, they can - it's quite stressful, so it might trigger their fight or flight response which can increase blood pressure, increase heart rate - and again, that can lead to chronic diseases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe College of GPs has taken steps to address the issue, including introducing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander training framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Wright says the organisation is all too aware that more needs to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been asking our members how common that is, and we've got some strategies for reducing the impact of that for our patients and for our GPs, many of whom did their medical degrees in other countries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Nicholls is glad to hear it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been lots of discussions over the years about the impacts of racism, and whilst it has been a long time coming it is very welcome, and any opportunity to actually highlight it and address it is to be applauded.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The federal government has appeared to have quietly abandoned a federal truth-telling commission, admitting it is keeping tabs on state progress instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he was elected as prime minister in 2022, Anthony Albanese committed to the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Voice to Parliament referendum failed, the government had previously committed to a Makarrata Commission to oversee truth-telling and treaty-making, allocating $5.8 million in funding for its establishment last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it now admits that \"we are not working on a specific proposal around a Makaratta Commission\".\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters has questioned whether the Albanese government is making progress towards its truth-telling committment. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Greens leader Larissa Waters quizzed the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) about the status of the funding in Senate estimates on Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NIAA revealed that much of the funding had been drawn into a contingency fund, with the agency financing a part-time salary to monitor progress in other states.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt came after Waters questioned whether the NIAA had made a budget submission for renewed funding or for other truth-telling mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So you've gone from $5.8 million for the Makaratta truth telling to now half a person looking at what other jurisdictions are doing,\" Waters responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NIAA said it was aware of a \"range of jurisdictions that have activities related to truth-telling\". In Victoria, that progress goes as far as treaty legislation , which will be debated in parliament next week.\n\n\n\n\"Primarily, the work the branch is doing is looking at what's going on around other jurisdictions,\" NIAA acting deputy CEO Deborah Fulton told the committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Half a person?\" Waters asked.\n\n\n\n\n\nFulton replied: \"Essentially, yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFulton said the organisation was administering other programs, like the Stolen Generations Redress Scheme, which provides financial compensation and healing to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people removed from their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of this year's Garma Festival, Yolngu leader and chair of the Yothu Yindi Foundation Djawa Yunupingu told SBS News that truth-telling at a national level was a top priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Albanese did not endorse support for a broad truth-telling process during his speech at Garma, instead praising Victoria's progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a nation, we are still coming to terms with the full truth and toll of this exclusion,\" he said while acknowledging the work of Victoria's Yoorrook Justice Commission.\n\n\n\nIn July, the nation's first truth-telling inquiry handed down its final report, containing 100 recommendations for urgent change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even as we continue on the long journey of understanding our past, we must meet our responsibility to the future,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese instead used his Garma address to focus on \"economic sovereignty\" through the establishment of new partnerships between government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News understands the Greens will reintroduce their Truth and Justice Commission bill in this term of parliament, but the exact timing is unclear.\n\n\n\n'The government should stick to its promise'\n\nIndependent senator Lidia Thorpe called on the government to \"stick to its promise\" and establish a national commission within this term, telling SBS News that truth-telling \"is how this country can finally see the truth of history with open eyes \u2014 without it, we\u2019ll never mature as a nation.\"\n\n\n\nIndependent senator Lidia Thorpe said the truth-telling commission should have royal commission powers. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas \"The Prime Minister was full of praise for Yoorrook at Garma, but he refuses to act nationally,\" she said in a statement. \"He can\u2019t hide behind the failed Voice referendum.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth-telling must come first, Thorpe said, \"so people in this country can learn the true history. Until that happens, we\u2019ll keep seeing racism and misinformation spread about First Peoples\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA government spokesperson told SBS News: \"The Albanese government remains committed to the principles of the Uluru Statement from the Heart \u2014 including truth-telling.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We support the work being done in states and territories, particularly Victoria.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Aldi Australia has revealed it has no plans to remove self-checkouts across its supermarket network, after it emerged that several of its international stores would no longer be offering the service.\n\nAcross the US, Aldi customers reported that a number of stores had gradually been reducing self-serve kiosks, with some locations now not offering them at all. In Australia, self-checkouts are widespread across the country's biggest retailers, including supermarkets Woolworths, Coles and Aldi, as well as other heavyweights like Bunnings and Big W.\n\nThe kiosks have been credited with speeding up the payment process, which would otherwise rely on staff members individually processing and bagging customers' groceries. Opponents, on the other hand, say they come at the cost of jobs, while also increasing instances of theft.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSome have also pointed out that the self-checkout lanes can reduce store efficiency, as user errors often require staff intervention, and staff performance is, in many cases, timed and evaluated for speed on every task they handle.\n\nIn recent months, posts to social media across the US soared from disgruntled shoppers, questioning where the self-serve had gone at their local stores. In response, Aldi in the US said that while the checkouts \"will remain available at many stores\", they had been indefinitely scrapped in others.\n\n\"We continually test and refine our in-store technologies and checkout options to better address customer needs and enhance operational efficiency,\" an Aldi spokesperson told US outlet Axios Chicago. The supermarket did not state how many stores will lose or have already lost their self-checkout kiosks, but online theories suggest theft could be the true driver behind the move.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News this week, an Aldi Australia spokesperson confirmed the supermarket would be keeping self-checkouts across its stores. It did not directly respond to questions on whether it planned to reconsider or revise its strategy in light of overseas removals.\n\nAldi offers self-serve counters across the country. Source: Reddit\n\nSupermarkets respond amid soaring reports of checkout theft\n\nIf Aldi were to remove any kiosks in future, it wouldn't be the first time a supermarket had done so in Australia. The IGA in the inner Brisbane suburb of Greenslopes shut down its self-serve checkouts last year, with a sign citing a \"significant increase in shoplifting\" as the reason behind the move.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile Woolworths and Coles haven't yet gone as far as doing the same, each has rolled out several anti-theft initiatives in recent years in response to what both describe as soaring levels of theft.\n\nIn Australia, QUT retail expert Gary Mortimer said shoplifting was costing retailers about $9 billion each year, and was impacting all kinds of businesses.\n\n\"It's unsurprising to see more and more retailers implementing technology to reduce crime,\" he had earlier told Yahoo. \"Retail theft can happen anywhere within a store, at the self-service area, or in quiet locations around the perimeters of a store.\"\n\nThe US scale-back comes after other major American retailers, such as Walmart and Dollar General, also removed large numbers of self-checkouts, as well as the UK grocery chain Booths.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Imagine two scenarios. In the first, you\u2019re hiking uphill on a warm day, beads of sweat rolling down your forehead. In the second, you\u2019ve just remembered you have an exam tomorrow and now the palms of your hands are cold and damp.\n\nBoth involve sweating but the causes and implications are different.\n\nOne scenario produces hot sweat, the other cold sweat. So what\u2019s the difference?\n\nWhat is hot sweat?\n\nThis type of sweat is also called thermoregulatory sweat. It\u2019s the body\u2019s natural response to increased core body temperature, which most often comes from physical exertion. As sweat evaporates from the skin, it cools down the body to help prevent overheating.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen you\u2019ve been exercising, or are outside on a hot day, your body warms up, then sends a message to the hypothalamus region of your brain.\n\nYour hypothalamus likes to keep your body in an optimum temperature range. So to reduce heat stress it sends signals down the spinal cord and into peripheral nerves (nerves outside the spinal cord and brain). This stimulates secretion of sweat from the eccrine glands in your skin.\n\nHumans have millions of eccrine glands, which are packed at a density of 250\u2013550 glands per square centimetre on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Places where you have hair (such as the face, trunk and limbs) have a lower density of eccrine glands.\n\nSweat from eccrine glands is mostly water and salt.\n\nWhat is cold sweat?\n\nCold sweat is also called psychological sweat. It appears when you\u2019re experiencing stress, anxiety, fear or pain.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThese activate the amygdala, the brain region that helps you feel and respond to emotions. The amygdala then activates the hypothalamus.\n\nThe hypothalamus performs multiple functions simultaneously. It sends signals down the spinal cord and into peripheral nerves to stimulate eccrine glands in the skin.\n\nIt also sends a message to the adrenal glands sitting above the kidneys to release norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) hormones. These hormones travel through the blood and affect a different type of sweat gland in the skin, the apocrine glands.\n\nApocrine glands are mainly in the armpit, breasts, face and perineum (where the external genitalia are). Sweat from apocrine glands contains lots of lipids (fats), proteins, sugar and ammonia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs cold sweat triggers eccrine and apocrine glands, you can sweat all over your body.\n\nWhich type smells more?\n\nSweat itself \u2013 whether hot or cold \u2013 does not smell. But when bacteria on your skin feed on sweat, this produces volatile organic compounds. And it\u2019s these that smell. Blame bacteria such as Corynebacterium, Staphyloccocus and Cutibacterium.\n\nA small study from Japan showed stress, not exercise, triggered unpleasant body odours in people who normally don\u2019t have body odour.\n\nThat\u2019s probably because bacteria prefer the cold sweat from apocrine glands. It\u2019s a tasty meal, full of fat, protein and sugars.\n\nAnother study analysed the results of 26 earlier studies involving 1,652 people. This showed that when we\u2019re frightened, we give off specific smells via our sweat.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo yes, fear and stress really do have a distinctive smell that should warn others to stay away.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nThe terms hot and cold sweat don\u2019t refer to the temperature of the sweat itself. The fluid released is always at body temperature.\n\nProducing hot sweat is normal and an effective way for your body to lose heat. Cold sweat signals to others that you\u2019re distressed in some way.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your sweating, see your GP. This is especially important if you start sweating more, less, or differently on either side of your body, without changing your lifestyle.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
