Around 80 per cent of Kooshoo\u2019s business is with the United States.\n\nNorfolk Island business owners Jesse Schiller and Rachel Evans.

Norfolk, of course, in the UK, Norfolk in Virginia in the US, and it seems as though some improperly labelled customs paperwork may have contributed to the \u2026 error,\u201d Schiller said.\n\n\u201cThat could\u2019ve been very easily fact-checked,\u201d he added.\n\nGeese and a cow graze on a roadside unaffected by a passing car near a former convict barracks on Norfolk Island.

She is a 9th generation descendant of a crewman of the British naval ship HMS Bounty who mutinied in 1789, although her mother is Canadian. The mutineers, whose exploits have been dramatised in Hollywood movies, established a settlement on Pitcairn Islands and their descendants later settled the former British penal colony of Norfolk Island.\n\nShe said the sustainable lifestyle she had learned from growing up on such an isolated island around 8 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide had been part of the brand since they started their business in Vancouver 15 years ago.\n\nShe was confident their business would survive the latest trade barriers.",

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nGreer testified that \"about 50'' countries had sought talks to escape Trump's import tariffs, which are due to come into effect at midnight (3pm AEST) on Wednesday, and that he'd \"talked to the Australians\" about beef.\n\nWhile Australia doesn't impose any tariffs on US imports, it bans fresh beef from any country with reported cases of mad cow disease, a restriction the US has taken issue with for some years and called out in the updated Office of the US Trade Representative Foreign Trade Barriers report last week.\n\nTexas Republican John Cornyn was the first senator to take a pop at Australia over the restrictions, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already declared \"not up for negotiation\".\n\nHe complained that \"Texas happens to produce a lot of beef cattle, and Australia basically denies access to its huge market\".\n\nGreer was happy to take a swing, declaring Canberra's approach \"incredible\".\n\n\"It's always surprising, because we have a free trade agreement with Australia, and we would expect that we would have fair, reciprocal trade,\" he said.\n\nSenator John Cornyn questions US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as he testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\n\"Last year, I think we imported about $US3 billion ($5 billion) of Australian beef, and we exported $0 of American beef to Australia.\n\n\"And it's not just beef. Australia also blocks on specious fake science grounds the export of fresh and frozen US pork.\"\n\nTrump terrified Australian farmers when he singled out the beef restrictions in his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement but they escaped with with \"just\" the \"baseline\" 10 per cent charge applied to almost all countries, thanks to Canberra's trade surplus with Washington .\n\nIn a leaders' debate on Tuesday night, Albanese said \"Australia got the best deal of any country on the planet\" while still labelling the tax an \"act of economic self-harm\" and promising to keep negotiating. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said he would \"stand up against bullies\" and \"make the right economic decisions for our country\".\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, left, gestures as Opposition leader Peter Dutton watches during their TV debate in Sydney, Australia, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Jason Edwards/Pool Photo via AP) (AP)\n\nThey appeared to have an ally in Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, who told the committee Australia was \"one of our strongest allies\" and forcefully questioned why imports from Down Under were hit with even a 10% charge.\n\nHe started by questioning\ufeff the Trump administration's \"fancy Greek formula\" used to calculate the tariffs, which he described as \"bad math on steroids\".\n\n\"Excuse me, ambassador, excuse me, there is a trade \u2014 we already have a free trade agreement. We have a trade surplus,\" he said in a heated exchange filled with interruptions.\n\n\"So getting the least bad \u2014 why did they get a tariff in the first place?\"\n\nGreer said the Trump administration was addressing America's $US1.2 trillion \"largest in human history\" global trade deficit and \"we should be running up the score on Australia\".\n\nSenator Mark Warner questions US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as he testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\n\"They ban our beef and they ban our pork,\" he said.\n\nWarner argued that \"insulting the Australians undermines our national security\", labelling the tariff policy \"ridiculous\" and \"extraordinary\".\n\nEven before the tariffs were confirmed, Albanese said Australia was not prepared to \"weaken\" its biosecurity laws in order to become exempt from Trump's imminent tariffs\n\n\"Not on my watch. On my watch, our biosecurity system is essential,\" he added.\n\n\"We will negotiate sensibly but we will not undermine the biosecurity system.\"\n\nGreer appeared to shut the door on any easing of tariffs without such a concession.\n\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\n\"We have a lot of countries coming to talk to us right now who want to have more reciprocal trade, get their trade deficit down, and obviously part of that is making sure we have access for products like beef, making sure we're exporting products like beef,\" he said, in response to Wyoming Republican John Barrasso's complaints that his state's farmers \"can't sell a hamburger\" in Australia.\n\n\"I've talked to the Australians about this issue. It's always surprising, because they're, you know, a great partner for us, this is a big issue with them, South East Asia as well.\n\n\"These are things that are on our list. When people come to talk to us. It's something we've reported for years. We expect, we expect countries to change this.\"\ufeff\n\nSeveral senators demanded that Greer explain what the administration was seeking to accomplish. At various times, Trump has said the tariffs were meant to raise money for the Treasury, bring manufacturing back to the US, protect domestic industries and get other countries to make concessions.\n\nUS Lawmakers, including Republicans, are getting jittery about the trade wars, especially since stocks collapsed after he announced broad tariffs last Wednesday.\n\nSenator Mark Warner listens as US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nThe market rebounded on Tuesday on hopes that negotiations would convince the president to lower or suspend the tariffs.\n\n\"It seems like we've decided to begin a trade war on all fronts,\u2033 said Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\nHe said he wanted to know who in the Trump administration he should hold responsible \u2014 and choke \u2014 if the tariffs fail and Americans suffer.\n\n\"I wish you well,\u2033 he told Greer. \"But I am sceptical.''\n\nIn a press briefing on Tuesday (early Wednesday AEDT), White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told countries looking for a better deal to \"bring us your best offers\" but warned retaliation such as from China was a \"mistake\".\n\n\"President Trump has a spine of steel that he will not break and America will not break under his leadership,\" she said.\n\nShould Australia lift its ban on American beef?

        "text": "US President Donald Trump is set to impose an astounding 104 per cent in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday local time (Thursday AEST), White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced.\n\nThis comes on top of Chinese tariffs that were in place prior to Trump's second term.\n\nChina was already set to see tariffs increase by 34 per cent on Wednesday as part of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50 per cent after Beijing didn't back off its promise to impose 34 per cent retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday, adding an additional 84 per cent in duties.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is set to impose an additional 84 per cent in levies across all Chinese imports on April 9, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced. (Fang Dongxu/FeatureChina/AP via CNN)\n\nEarlier Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said it \"firmly opposes\" the additional 50 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports, calling it \"a mistake upon a mistake.\" The ministry vowed to escalate its retaliation on US exports.\n\nUS stocks, which soared Tuesday morning, began moving lower off Leavitt's comments. By 3pm ET (5am Wednesday AEST) the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 were all in negative territory.\n\n\"Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,\" Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump. (AP)\n\n\"President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.\n\n\"The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don't know how to do it.\"\n\nShe declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China.\n\nTrump initially imposed a 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods in February, with no exceptions, tying it to the country's alleged role in aiding illegal immigration and getting fentanyl into the US. Last month, he doubled those rates.\n\nChina was America's second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of US$439 billion ($735.69 billion) worth of goods to the US, while the US exported US$144 billion ($241.32 billion) worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs.\n\nREAD MORE: US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr urges states to ban fluoride in drinking water \ufeff\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. (AP)\n\nWhen Trump's first term ended, the US charged an average tariff rate of 19.3 per cent on Chinese goods, according to a Peterson Institute for International Economic analysis. The Biden administration kept most of Trump's tariffs in place while also adding additional ones, bringing the average rate to 20.8 per cent.\n\nCome Wednesday in the US, the total average tariff on Chinese exports to the US will soar to nearly 125 per cent.\n\nWhile previous rounds of Chinese tariffs caused more American businesses to look to other foreign countries like Mexico and Vietnam to manufacture goods, China remained the top foreign source of several items.\n\nThat includes, among others, toys, communication equipment such as smartphones, computers and a wide range of other consumer electronics. All these goods are likely to cost US consumers substantially more soon.\n\nThe full list of Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs View Gallery\n\nDozens of countries set to see higher tariffs soon, too\n\nDozens of other countries as well as the European Union also face a midnight deadline for new tariff rates. Those rates, which Trump laid out last week, range from 11 per cent to 50per cent.\n\nLeavitt told reporters that despite several conversations with world leaders aiming to negotiate lower tariff rates, Trump has little appetite to delay his plans.\n\nHaving spoken with Trump earlier on Tuesday, Leavitt said, \"He expects that these tariffs are going to go into effect.\"\n\nAt the same time, she said Trump instructed his trade team to make \"tailor-made\" deals with countries that want to negotiate.\n\nPressed further on whether the president had any timeline or deadline for the trade deals, Leavitt again reiterated that they won't be \"off-the-rack deals.\"\n\nShould Australia trade more with China?

        "text": "In a world that often feels divided, a huge festival in the western Melbourne suburb of Spotswood stands as a powerful reminder of the beauty that can emerge when cultures converge.\n\nThrough art, music, food and shared stories, the Victorian Multicultural Festival (VMF) bridges cultural divides.\n\nThe day I attended, the atmosphere was alive with spirited vocals of a Mariachi band, and bright, soaring notes of a trumpet, harmonies of guitarr\u00f3n and rhythmic strumming of acoustic guitar. A crowd of dancing feet surrounded me.\n\nMelbourne-based Mariachi band, the Mariachi Bronco trio, brought soaring harmonies to the festival. (Supplied)\n\nCurator Nardia Brancatisano brought to this year's three-day festival \u2014 among many other performances \u2014 traditional Greek sounds with a contemporary twist, in Melbourne's Anagennisi band; K-Pop dance from group 155cm; performances by Arabic band Marcel Khalife; Bollywood dance by NB Dance; and African ensemble Firefly, performing West African dancing and drumming.\n\nThe VMF is one of the biggest festivals of its kind in Australia, and Brancatisano says, for her, it's about \"honouring our traditions of the past, all that has been passed down to us and how we can evolve these traditions as we learn from one another\".\n\nDancing to feel less excluded\n\nFor over 40 years, the Victorian Multicultural Commission, which runs the festival, has been a leading force in representing cultural diversity. This year, for example, the VMF featured an artistic line-up celebrating cultures including Australia's First Nations, African, Greek, Italian, Middle Eastern, Mexican, French, Indian and more.\n\nIn one performance, Matthew Nguyen led a group lion dancing, with with Hung Hing Lion Dance Association. It's a dynamic traditional Chinese celebratory art form symbolising good luck and prosperity. Highly physically demanding, the performance featured costumed performers mimicking a lion's movements.\n\n24-year-old lion dancer Matthew Nguyen says performing is a joyful experience, and one that makes him feel \"less excluded\". (Supplied)\n\nThere are various styles of lion dancing, including the northern style, characterised by a more acrobatic approach, and the southern or Singaporean style, that Nguyen performs, which blends traditional moves with innovative choreography.\n\nNguyen loves it not only for the confidence it has instilled in him but also for the opportunity it provides to celebrate his culture.\n\nHe began lion dancing at age 14, and says interest in it is growing within the Singaporean Australian community.\n\nNguyen says festivals like the VMF, along with Chinese New Year celebrations, are joyful and rewarding, and offer a chance for his community to showcase their art to broader audiences.\n\n\"The more everyone is exposed to it, the less we feel excluded in society,\" he says.\n\nDancers from the Hung Hing Lion Dance Association. Interest in their art form is growing. (Supplied)\n\nBollywood dance brings 'immense joy'\n\nAnother stand-out performance from the festival was from NB Dance, a Bollywood dance troupe established by Natasha Baweja in 2013.\n\nNB Dance fuses traditional Bollywood styles \u2014 ranging from folk to classical \u2014 with contemporary moves that often incorporate hip-hop influences. Baweja's dance journey began in childhood, fuelled by a desire to create a community of dance-lovers.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBaweja says performing at the VMF was a transformative experience.\n\n\"Seeing the audience connect with us, whether it's two people or 200, brings us immense joy,\" she says.\n\nWith a microphone in hand on VMF's main stage, Baweja instructed an enthusiastic crowd, which steadily moved closer while she maintained the beat and matched the high energy of the performers behind her.\n\nAfter demonstrating the routine, the troupe invited young audience members to take centre stage under their expert guidance, turning them into Bollywood dancers.\n\nLeading the dance workshops for a crowd of people \"who embody Australia's multicultural spirit\" is enriching, she says; not just for her troupe but for the participants, too.\n\n\"This experience is a major part of why we do what we do.\"\n\nBollywood dancing is another high-intensity art form, even if not everyone knows it, Baweja says.\n\n\"Many don't realise that delivering a five-minute performance on stage requires nearly 15 hours of hard work.\"\n\nK-pop stands out\n\nAs the evening I attended progressed, the energy on stage surged with stunning performances from K-Pop dance crew 155cm.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Yunshu Guo, also known as Becky, the group began as a duo and has since expanded to five members, united by their passion for the vibrant world of K-Pop.\n\nThe name 155cm is a humorous reference to the height of the group's members. (Supplied)\n\nAs the genre continues to gain popularity in Australia, Becky has witnessed its transformation from a niche interest to a mainstream phenomenon.\n\n\"You can hear K-Pop in shopping centres and restaurants, and there's a noticeable increase in Korean cultural events, public dance gatherings, and festivals like VMF,\" she says.\n\nFor Becky, K-Pop is more than just music; it's a way to foster community.\n\nK-Pop is known for synchronised group performances and unique choreography to \"make each group stand out\", Becky explains. (Supplied)\n\n\" It's a genre that welcomes everyone, transcending age and cultural boundaries. \"\n\nSynchronised choreography hit every mark, creating picture-perfect silhouettes between lyrics.\n\nBecky says she is proud to see the audience, especially young people, dancing and singing along.\n\n'Multiculturalism is not just a theme'\n\nThe VMF runs during the Victorian Multicultural Commission's Cultural Diversity Week, celebrated annually in March, during which time Brancatisano says, \"Multiculturalism is not just a theme for a week; it's a core value that shapes our identity as a community.\"\n\nSupporters and organisers at the 2025 Victorian Multicultural Festival. (Supplied)\n\nCoordinating a festival of this scale was exhausting, she admits, but also extremely satisfying.\n\n\"The moments when people shared their stories ... and truly embraced each other's cultures made it all worthwhile.\n\n\"It was incredibly rewarding to see so many communities come together to celebrate our rich cultural diversity,\" says Brancatisano, who is already looking ahead to next year's festival.\n\nDark Mofo 2025 line-up Photo shows In a warehouse space, red lights, shaped like inverted crosses, hang from the ceiling, above candlelit tables, where people eat. The Tasmanian winter arts and music festival is back, with its first line-up under new artistic director Chris Twite.\n\nKashif Bouns, director at VMC, echoes Brancatisano's enthusiasm.\n\n\"Every migrant has a journey, and so does our state \u2014 one that spans from First Nations history to the White Australia Policy, culminating in the multicultural society we embrace today,\" he says.\n\nBouns says the festival acknowledges those journeys, and celebrates the way they shape our communities.\n\nThe festival is supported by cultural diversity champions like Victorian Multicultural Commission (VMC) chairperson Vivien Nguyen, commissioners Tarang Chawla, Dr Judy Tang and Krushnadevisinh Ravalji, Gary Lee from the City of Melbourne, and community leaders Zarmeen Hassan of Salam Fest, and Fred Alale of African Music and Cultural Festival.\n\nThey have each praised the VMF for its role in fostering cultural connections, sharing stories and encouraging community engagement.\n\n\"Nothing transcends cultural barriers like music,\" Alale says.\n\nGrazeland's Ben Hodgetts, who collaborated with VMC on the festival, says the goal has been to connect performers \"with new audiences and ignite a spark for future artists\".\n\nHe believes that's just what happened this year.",

(Supplied)\n\nLast week, the federal health department accepted an expanded definition of infertility that would allow LGBTIQ+ couples and single people like Sarah to be able to access Medicare rebates for assisted reproductive technology, including IUI and IVF.\n\nPreviously rebates were generally only available once a medical cause of infertility was diagnosed.\n\nThe Medicare eligibility expansion came into effect immediately on acceptance of the new definition, according to Manuela Toledo, board member with the Fertility Society of Australian and New Zealand.\n\n\"The clinics are applying for the rebate on behalf of the patients,\" Dr Toledo says.\n\nWe spoke to Sarah about the changes, and what they would have meant to her when trying to conceive as a solo mum by choice.\n\nThese are her words.\n\nI had to grieve the dream of happily ever after\n\nI was 32 when I started thinking about doing motherhood alone.\n\nThe biological clock was ticking. I knew at 35, that's when things started to drop off [fertility wise].\n\nI worked in child care since I was 16. I had to be a mum.\n\nBut first I had to grieve the dream of happily ever after.\n\nHowever, the thought of having a child for the rest of my life, that was just so exciting.\n\nSarah McBride had two failed IUI cycles before she moved on to subsidised treatment. (Supplied)\n\nOnce I had seen a fertility specialist and got a list of all the fees and rebates, I saw there was a big cross through the IUI rebate because I wasn't eligible as someone classed as 'socially infertile'.\n\nI have a friend who went through IVF with donor sperm with her husband, and they could go straight to IVF with rebates because they were a straight couple who had been deemed medically infertile.\n\nI had to do two unsuccessful rounds of IUI before I could get Medicare, and that was going to cost $6,000, plus the medications.\n\nWill the expanded definition of infertility impact your journey to parenthood?

And it's often not just financial debt they are left with, either.\n\nThere were definitely tears cried.\n\nKnowing that I had to jump through the extra hoops before I had autonomy; before I could make decisions about my body.\n\nI also knew I wanted more than one child, and having two successful IUIs is very uncommon.\n\nI was told IUI has about a 12 per cent success rate with my age and medical history. Whereas IVF at my age it was closer to 50 per cent, and I was shut off from that.\n\nif I could have gone straight to IVF and created five embryos, for example, then I could have just done another embryo transfer after my daughter was born.\n\nIt would have been less procedures, less time, and less emotional turmoil.\n\nDoing IUI and IVF was so all-consuming; financially, emotionally, physically. I had no life apart from working and treatment.\n\nAnd the options of donors that really caught me by surprise.\n\nFor donors to donate to IUI, they have to be a certain quality of sperm, and there were not a lot of donors on that list.\n\nIf I had been able to go to IVF, I would have had more to choose from.\n\nMy IVF experience\n\nI did the two IUIs, followed by two egg collections.\n\nMy daughter was my second embryo transfer.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday.

        "text": "The final report into the Sea World helicopter crash, which claimed the lives of four people, has found a faulty radio antenna contributed to the collision.\n\nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report, released today, has highlighted a series of safety issues contributing to the crash that also injured nine others on the Gold Coast in 2023.\n\nLive Moment Live updates, reactions and contributions from ABC readers. Four issues yet to be 'adequately addressed' Mr Mitchell says while some actions have been taken by Sea World Helicopters Heli Tours to improve safety measures in response to the accident, there's still four issues raised by the ATSB yet to be \"adequately addressed\". \"The most significant focus is on increasing opportunity for pilots to detect conflicting traffic,\" he says. \"We would also like to see implementation of a formal process, of how future changes to flight operations will be considered.\" 'A number of holes lined up' Mr Mitchell says \"a number of holes lined up for this accident to occur\". \"Commercial aviation must have multiple safety defences in place,\" he says \"It should never be vulnerable to single point failures such as faulty radio or pilots ability to visually detect another aircraft in the sky.\" Failure in radio antenna, limited opportunity for pilots The approaching helicopter was travelling at 180kmph around 800m away, and the pilot had sighted the departing aircraft. But Mr Mitchell says he did not receive a 'taxiing call' \u2014 an aviation term for manoeuvring the aircraft on the ground. The ATSB found that there was a failure in the pilot's radio antenna. \"Both pilots had very limited opportunities to detect the other aircraft,\" he says. ATSB recreated the physical structures of the helicopters, validated thousands of data points, and analysed extensive footage during the study. Outdated advice as helicopter departs Two minutes before the collision, an inbound call from the landing helicopter failed to register with the departing pilot, who was \"busy loading passengers\". \"A member of the ground crew advised the departing pilot that the air space was clear,\" Mr Mitchell says. \"However, this advice was outdated by the time the helicopter took off 20 minutes later.\" Constant and defined conflict point between aircraft The second helipad introduced nine months earlier created a \"constant\" and \"defined\" conflict point between launching and landing helicopters, Mr Mitchell says. In addition, the investigation found the new helicopters were not equipped with UHF internal company radios, an iPad with maps showing real time positions of other aircraft, or high visibility paint on the helicopter's rotor blades. Two new helicopters introduced a week prior Mr Mitchell says the tourism operator introduced two new helicopters into its joy flights a week prior to the crash. He says the owner \"wanted to improve his tourism product\". \"However, over time a number of these changes undermined what were existing risk controls used to manage aircraft separation.\" Crash investigation reveals 28 findings Mr Mitchell says the crash investigation has made 28 findings that have highlighted key safety lessons for the future of Australian aviation. \"I also acknowledge that beyond the physical injuries suffered by those on board, many people have been deeply affected by this incident.\" National transport safety investigator hands down Sea World crash report Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Angus Mitchell is speaking on the final report findings into the Sea World helicopter crash. The mid-air collision in 2023 killed four people and seriously injured six others.\n\nThe fatal mid-air collision over the city's Broadwater estuary on the afternoon of January 2, 2023 sent shock waves across the country.\n\nTwo choppers fell from the sky in front of shocked holiday-makers, mostly families, who were spending the day at the popular theme park after ringing in the new year in the tourist capital.\n\nSea World Helicopters chief pilot Ashley Jenkinson, New South Wales woman Vanessa Tadros and UK couple Diane and Ron Hughes died when the two choppers crashed into each other as one took off and the other came in to land.\n\nThree passengers \u2014 including two children \u2014 were also critically injured in the 2023 tragedy.\n\nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has released its final report into the deadly crash. (AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nIn March 2023, a preliminary report by the ATSB found Michael James \u2014 the pilot of the returning helicopter, who managed to safely land \u2014 had not heard a call over the radio by Mr Jenkinson, who was taking off.\n\nToday's report determined the radio system of the departing helicopter, used for external communication, had \"defects that limited transmission range\".\n\n\"It is almost certain that a taxi call was not successfully broadcast from (the departing flight),\" the report said.\n\n\" It is likely that the pilot made a taxi call, and that it was subject to transmission failure. \"\n\nHelicopter pilot Ash Jenkinson (left) with friend Andrew Taylor. (Supplied: Andrew Taylor)\n\nAdvice was 'outdated by the time the helicopter took off'\n\nThe report also found the reopening of a helipad in March 2022 created a conflict point at which was an increased risk of collision.\n\nThe opening of the pad created a higher workload for both pilots, made it less likely they would notice changes to a helicopter on the ground, and meant the aircraft collision avoidance systems would not issue warnings.\n\nTwo minutes before the collision, an inbound call from the landing helicopter failed to register with Mr Jenkinson, who was \"busy loading passengers\".\n\nFour people were killed in the collission. (AAP: Jono Searle)\n\n\"A member of the ground crew advised the departing pilot that the air space was clear,\" ATSB chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said.\n\n\"However, this advice was outdated by the time the helicopter took off 20 minutes later.\"\n\nA change of ownership and operations in 2018 \"gradually degraded existing controls of enhanced communication and in-cockpit traffic display that informed team situation awareness\", the report found.\n\nThe joy flight helicopters collided mid-air on January 2, 2023. (AAP: Dave Hunt )\n\nAnother interim ATSB report, released in 2024, found that Mr Jenkinson had traces of cocaine in his system, but it was unlikely to have affected his motor skills.\n\nThe ATSB said it conducts \"no blame\" investigations as it is an independent federal agency that aims to improve safety and public confidence in air, rail, and marine transport.\n\n'Deeply saddened and heartbroken'\n\nDiane Hughes, 75, and Ron Hughes, 65, were married only one year before the tragedy.\n\nThe United Kingdom couple were visiting Australian relatives on the Gold Coast when they were killed on the joy flight.\n\nDiane Hughes and Ronald (Ron) Hughes died in the Sea World crash. (Facebook: Diane Hughes)\n\nMrs Hughes's children, Lewis Ainsworth and Sian Long, said they were \"deeply saddened and heartbroken\".\n\nThey said the release of the report had \"brought some clarity and understanding to what happened that fateful day\" and helped the family \"piece together\" what happened.\n\n\"We are grateful for the thorough and professional work the ATSB has done in investigating this incident,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Their dedication to uncovering the truth has provided our family with vital information and a sense of respect and accountability.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nBut Mr Ainsworth and Ms Long said Sea World Helicopters Heli Tours had been \"nothing short of disappointing\" in its handling of the tragedy.\n\n\"Their lack of transparency and failure to take responsibility for the devastating loss of our loved ones has only deepened the pain and frustration,\" they said.\n\n\"The way they have handled this tragedy reflects poorly on them, and it's hard to reconcile their actions with the profound impact this has had on so many lives.\"\n\nClaims filed against Sea World Helicopters\n\nShine Lawyers national litigation specialist Roger Singh said he had filed a number of claims in the Supreme Court of Queensland on behalf of several people injured on board.\n\n\"These claims have been filed against Sea World Helicopters,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"The claims for the passengers of the helicopter have been filed under the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act which caps damages at $925,000 per claimant.\n\nVanessa Tadros was killed in the fatal helicopter crash. (ABC News: Harriet Tatham )\n\n\"We will examine the findings of this report with a view to identifying other potential defendants and further damages which may be sought.\"\n\nBut Mr Singh said \"no amount of money\" would give back what was taken from the victims of the crash.",

        "text": "US President Donald Trump seems to have latched on to a new expression: He wants to \"reset the table\".\n\nHe used the relatively benign-sounding phrase repeatedly in an Oval Office press conference yesterday to describe his hardline tariffs and aggressive posture toward foreign countries \u2014both allies and adversaries.\n\nA series of policies have up-ended the global trade system and wiped trillions of dollars of value from the face of the Earth.\n\nTo extend the metaphor, for many, it might feel like he's attempted to rip the tablecloth from under a fully set meal, leaving a very big mess on the floor.\n\nWhat jittery investors and world leaders alike are wondering is exactly what this new table setting will look like.\n\nWill Trump want any other countries seated next to him?\n\nOr will America be feasting alone on a more meagre meal?\n\nThere are several potential scenarios for how this could play out.\n\nAnd even though Trump is wielding enormous power right now, he alone won't decide what happens next.\n\nScenario 1: Trump backs down after extracting concessions\n\nTrump has long seen himself as the consummate deal maker.\n\nThe real estate tycoon's career has involved a series of high-risk ventures \u2014 some of which have paid off and some of which have ended in bankruptcy.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" Donald Trump said about the turmoil on the markets this week. (AP: Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nThe early stock market reaction to Trump's victory in November last year seemed to think his appetite for risk would benefit business.\n\nInvestors bet that his planned tax cuts would be good for earnings. And although he'd long railed against international trade, he was unlikely to do anything to badly damage it.\n\nInstead, what he'd do was talk tough, then cut new deals that he could claim were advantageous to the US.\n\nThis was, after all, how it played out in his first term.\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation was perhaps the best example.\n\nNAFTA, a three-country accord negotiated by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, came into effect in 1994 and fundamentally reshaped their economic relations, with trade increasing markedly.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump railed against NAFTA as \"the worst deal in the history of the country\".\n\nHe claimed it had moved production to Mexico and Canada at a cost to the US. Many in America's old industrial heartland \u2014 the so-called Rust Belt \u2014 would agree with him.\n\nBut once elected, instead of ditching NAFTA entirely, Trump negotiated a new deal: the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into effect in July 2020.\n\nThe new agreement did prioritise \"US\" in its initialism, but like NAFTA before it, it was focused on promoting trade between the three countries \u2014 not cutting it off.\n\nLoading...\n\nTrump claimed it as a political win, but for many, it was just NAFTA 2.0.\n\nThat's how most investors predicted Trump would behave this time around:\n\nPublicly decry other nations for treating America badly\n\nThreaten to destroy their access to the American market if they didn't change their ways\n\nThen, once there were some concessions, claim victory but basically leave trade relationships intact\n\nThat may still be how this ends up.\n\nTrump is certainly emboldened in his second term. He's achieved a remarkable political comeback and is now far more experienced with utilising the powers of the presidency.\n\nThis helps explain why he's decided to effectively take on the whole world at once. It's a massive gamble \u2014but it may pay off.\n\nDonald Trump insists his tariffs plan will reset global order, but many economists remain worried. (Reuters: Carlos Barria)\n\nUsually trade deals take years to negotiate. Trump's asking other countries to shed barriers in days.\n\nIt's also important to remember that many countries have major barriers to trade in place, which look unfair to many, be they monetary tariffs or currency manipulation. There are legitimate grievances and many will applaud if Trump is able to make international trade fairer.\n\nIf other countries offer him a series of concessions, be they meaningful or relatively superficial, Trump may take them and claim a win.\n\nIn such a scenario, we may well see global stocks bounce back robustly and the impact on economic growth may be relatively mild.\n\nOne analyst on Wall Street, who wasn't publicly cleared to talk to the media, told me this is how he thought it would play out:\n\n\"Let Trump cook,\" he said, confident the president could extract a great deal for the US.\n\nHow likely is this scenario?\n\nThe risk is that Trump may have already overplayed his hand.\n\nWhen he first began escalating his rhetoric about the US being badly treated, most countries tried to downplay the tension. We saw charm offensives by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House.\n\nWorld leaders who initially attempted to woo Donald Trump are now talking tough on his tariffs plan. (Reuters: Brian Snyder )\n\nBut with Trump's words now being backed by actions, an increasing number of countries have hardened their stance \u2014 led by Canada.\n\nTrump's repeated push for America's northern neighbour to fall in line and his derisive branding of its prime minister as a \"governor\" appear to have caused a national mood shift.\n\nWhat is a tariff? A tariff is a tax on a product imported from another country\n\nfrom another country It's paid to the government by the company that imports the product\n\nthat imports the product The tariff is generally calculated as a percentage of the price paid by the importer to the foreign seller\n\npaid by the importer to the foreign seller Historically, tariffs have pushed up prices as higher product costs are often passed on to consumers\n\nMany Canadians now believe they're being unfairly treated.\n\nNew Prime Minister Mark Carney is taking a harder line on Trump and has declared the once-close relationship between the two countries \"over\".\n\nHis position is politically popular, and he looks on track to win the upcoming election.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck says the European Union can defeat Trump if it sticks together.\n\nAnd China is threatening to take on the US directly, slapping US imports with a 34 per cent tariff. Trump has since retaliated with an additional 50 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, which are now in effect.\n\nBut China doesn't look to be backing away from this fight.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,\" the country's Commerce Ministry said.\n\nYou can see how quickly this can spiral out of control. Trump doesn't want to be seen as weak or backing down, but neither do other leaders.\n\nIf tariffs start pushing prices up noticeably for Americans and begin hurting businesses, Trump may be forced back to the negotiating table.\n\nScenario 2: Trump goes all in on his vision to reshape the world\n\nThe worry for most investors is that Trump isn't using the threat of tariffs to extract concessions \u2014 but instead genuinely believes in them.\n\nThe history of American tariffs offers stark insights into Trump's plans Photo shows Donald Trump stands and speaks at a podium in front of a portrait of Ronald Reagan Donald Trump's preoccupation with tariffs isn't new. But US history shows trade barriers end up costing everyone more.\n\nTrump has long trumpeted the value of trade duties. He claims tariffs are one of the \"most beautiful words in the English language\".\n\nFor decades \u2014 long before he entered politics \u2014 he praised their value, both as a means of raising tax revenue and as a way to incentivise companies to produce goods in America.\n\nTariffs push up the price of foreign goods, making it relatively cheaper to produce domestically.\n\nHe sees America \u2014 the world's largest economy \u2014 as a \"piggy bank\" that has been raided by other countries.\n\nHe has a rather retro view of economics. Instead of seeing the value in allowing American consumers to enjoy cheaper goods produced elsewhere, he sees such purchases as America sending its wealth offshore.\n\nIn his first term, most of his key economic team seemed able to curb his enthusiasm for tariffs, usually convincing him not to badly damage international trade by imposing tariffs on friendly nations.\n\nThis time it's different.\n\nOne of his key advisers is Peter Navarro, a counsellor to the president and one of the architects of this hardline trade policy.\n\nDonald Trump's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro is passionately pro-tariffs. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque)\n\nNavarro has long railed against free trade and he pushed a similar agenda during Trump's first term.\n\nWhat's different now is he seems far more influential.\n\nInstead of being effectively sidelined by former chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, Navarro is now front and centre, both determining trade policy and promoting it in near-constant media appearances.\n\nIn his first term, Trump also seemed more swayed by investors. Strong stock market performance was his proof of economic success, he'd claim.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" he said this week.\n\nWhat could happen if he pushes on?\n\nTrump genuinely believes America was better off when it had large tariffs in place to limit trade.\n\nMany economists disagree.\n\nMarkets have been in turmoil since Donald Trump announced his tariffs plan. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nThe last time the US imposed tariffs of the size Trump is proposing was in the 1930s.\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act into law, imposing taxes on more than 20,000 imported goods in an attempt to protect American jobs.\n\nOther countries responded in kind by imposing or increasing their own tariffs.\n\nThe economic situation deteriorated rapidly.\n\nUS unemployment soared from 8 per cent in 1930 all the way up to 25 per cent in 1933.\n\nGlobal trade plummeted by two-thirds between 1929 and 1934.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, American stocks declined by nearly 90 per cent.\n\nIt was a period of awful human suffering.\n\nThe lesson for many was clear: There are no winners in a global trade war.\n\nThe world hopes Trump's \"Liberation Day\" plan doesn't repeat the mistake of a century ago.",

(Supplied: Miles Franklin Literary Award/Belinda Rolland)\n\nAustralian author Jennifer Mills sits on the board of the Australian Society of Authors (ASA), one of almost 300 organisations that have signed onto the statement.\n\nShe said in addition to the threat to artists' livelihoods, there was also an emotional aspect at play.\n\n\"You spend years perfecting a book, working so hard, putting your heart and soul into something, and then to see it on a list of something that's been stolen is just really heartbreaking,\" Ms Mills said.\n\n\" I think it's actually really sad that these tech billionaires have such a misunderstanding of what art is and what it's for. \"\n\nIndustry stalwart OpenAI has also come under fire in the past week after launching a feature in their ChatGPT model which converts photographs to Studio Ghibli-style \"art\" \u2014 an artstyle pioneered by Hayao Miyazaki, whose opinions on AI-generated creations are well-known.\n\n'Theft': What's Australia doing?\n\nFederal Arts Minister Tony Burke told ABC Arts last week that there was nothing the Australian government could currently do to prevent unlicensed use of creatives' work to train AI models, a practice Mr Burke viewed as \"theft\".\n\n\"The nature of this intellectual property is that once AI has used it, there's no concept of return. It's done,\" he said.\n\nFederal Arts Minister Tony Burke told ABC Arts he views unlicensed AI training as 'theft'. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nHe said regulation and protection for artists has lagged behind technological innovation and addressing the problem needed to be a collaborative global affair.\n\n\"So we need the international system to catch up pretty quickly with where technology is taking us,\" he said.\n\n\"There's all the difference in the world between an artist \u2026 using it as a tool of their art, and someone who thinks that they've just written something for a publisher and suddenly discovering that some other company's just taken it.\"\n\nWhy we need to 'Save Our Arts' Photo shows Christos Tsiolkas Artists including Christos Tsiolkas, Suzie Miller and Tim Winton push for arts policy and funding to be on the agenda ahead of the federal election.\n\nMs Mills said she didn't believe that the Australian government was powerless to intervene.\n\nShe said the ASA wanted to see the government legislate to protect creators and force tech companies to act in good faith and \"do the right thing by [authors]\".\n\n\"They can license our work for AI training, pay us a fee, and that could become something that generates an ongoing income for authors to offset the downward pressure that's being put on our incomes and our livelihoods,\" she said.",

        "text": "Alfred Wolmark escaped the pogroms of eastern Europe to become one of the UK's pioneering post-impressionist painters.\n\nBut his contribution to art history has flown under the radar in Australia.\n\nHis family hopes that placing four original artworks for public auction for the first time in Australia will change that.\n\n\"I think as Mum draws towards the end of her life, it's really important that legacy continues on,\" Wolmark's granddaughter Lexi Hall said.\n\n\"We're very hopeful that a younger generation will actually like this style of painting again.\"\n\nInfluenced by Rembrandt\n\nWhile Wolmark's descendants now live in the New South Wales Northern Rivers, he was born in 1887 in Warsaw, in Russian-controlled Poland, during a time of Jewish persecution.\n\nHis family fled to England in 1883, and by age 18, living in London's East End, Wolmark was already becoming a prolific artist.\n\nWolmark painted his wife Bessie. (Supplied: Diana Hall/Menzies Art Brands)\n\n\"His early works often reflected Polish culture and his background from his birth country,\" Ms Hall said.\n\n\"He was quite influenced by Rembrandt and many of his paintings are quite dark.\"\n\nBut Wolmark's style took a marked turn after he got married, around 1910.\n\n\"He said my grandmother was the most beautiful woman he'd ever met in his life,\" Ms Hall said.\n\n\"There is a portrait of their wedding and the whole place is strewn with irises and white roses.\"\n\nWolmark began using bright colours in a style that was uncommon at the time, and was dubbed \"the colour king\".\n\n\"He came in for a lot of criticism from fellow artists, including a famous quote from one fellow artist, Walter Sickert, who said, 'You cannot see Mr Wolmark's pictures for the paint,'\" Ms Hall laughed.\n\nWolmark became known for his use of bright, vivid colours. (Supplied: Diana Hall/Menzies Art Brands)\n\nWolmark was prolific \u2014 on his 10-week honeymoon in France, he produced around 90 works \u2014 but he was not always financially successful.\n\n\"I have two uncles who were born in 1912 and 1913, who went to a quite expensive school in London,\" Ms Hall said.\n\n\"Their education was interrupted constantly. Unless grandpa sold a painting, he wasn't able to pay the fees.\"\n\nNevertheless, Wolmark achieved some renown during his life, with several significant exhibitions, and has been recognised posthumously as a pioneer of British modernism.\n\nMs Hall said some of his paintings were now in significant international collections, including several works at the Tate and National Gallery in London, but many were still owned by his family.\n\nPublic auction an Australian-first\n\nMs Hall said her family was offering four of Wolmark's original works for sale in a bid to keep his legacy alive.\n\nThe works include a sketch of the Flatiron building in New York, and three portraits, including one of Wolmark's wife Bessie, which brings some mixed emotion for his granddaughter\n\n\"I grew up looking at [my grandmother's portrait] every day of my life in our living room,\" Ms Hall said.\n\n\"It's a very beautiful painting and I feel very close to that, but I'm telling myself, at my age now, this is time for Bessie to go be enjoyed by somebody else.\"\n\nLexi Hall is prepared to farewell several of her grandfather's significant paintings. (Supplied: Lexi Hall)\n\nThe paintings are due to go under the hammer this evening, and Menzies Art Brands, which is holding the auction in Sydney, said the works had already gathered some overseas interest, particularly from buyers in London.\n\nChairperson Cameron Menzies said it was both unusual and \"tremendously exciting\" to have an international artist of Wolmark's pedigree available in an Australian art sale.\n\n\"He's a significant figure in British modernism but it's an interesting story because he doesn't have a presence on the secondary market in Australia, and the vast majority of British and European and international artists don't,\" Mr Menzies said.\n\n\"These effectively will be owned by a third-party collector for a first time, because they have passed from the artist to his daughter.\"\n\nMs Hall said her family was hopeful her grandfather's work and story would find new interest from an Australian audience.\n\n\"[His is] a very human story of initially fleeing persecution, coming to a completely different culture and charting that journey, if you like, all the way through his long life and now into beyond,\" she said.",

        "text": "Treasurer Bill Yan is facing a wicked problem.\n\nThe NT government wants to grow the population by 4,000 people per year, something that's only been achieved on a handful of occasions since the 1980s.\n\nMeanwhile, the NT's population has been growing by an average of less than 2,000 people per year over the past decade \u2014 the slowest growth rate in Australia.\n\nFrom the government's perspective, the benefits of growing the territory's population are clear: increased GST revenue, greater demand for small business services, and stimulation of a debt-ridden economy.\n\nBill Yan says boosting the NT's population will help turn around its economic fortunes. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\n\"If we grow our population across the board then we see more demand for those services, and when there's demand we see an increase in supply,\" Mr Yan said.\n\nHow will the NT boost its population?\n\nLast month the government signed NT DAMA III, a federal government agreement which will see the territory onboard up to 1,500 skilled migrants from overseas per year.\n\nThe issue is, the territory already takes on thousands of international migrants every year, and it's done little to grow the overall population.\n\nThat's because the NT's population is leaking interstate.\n\nSince COVID-19, the NT has lost a greater portion of its population interstate than any other Australian jurisdiction, cancelling out the gains made from international arrivals.\n\nCharles Darwin University Associate Professor Andrew Taylor said while the territory attracted plenty of migrants, few come with the intention of staying long-term.\n\n\"For us to reach the 4,000 figure something would have to fundamentally change, and unfortunately there's not really any sign that things are changing,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Taylor says the government's population target is ambitious. (ABC News: Owen Jacques)\n\nComplicating matters further, Professor Taylor said unlike other jurisdictions, the creation of jobs in the NT had not coincided with long-term population growth.\n\nHistorically, sudden population growth triggered by large-scale projects like the INPEX gas project in 2012 and the refurbishment of the Darwin waterfront precinct in the mid-2000s has been short-lived, with employees leaving the territory soon afterwards.\n\nWith the NT's debt now mounting to nearly $12 billion, both Treasury and the NT's leading demographers are looking outside the box for solutions.\n\nHow can you get people to stay?\n\nWith one of the largest fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workforces in the country, Mr Yan said he wanted more FIFO workers from the territory's gas and minerals sector to settle in the NT.\n\n\"The great thing is that most of these companies agree with the territory government, they don't want to see a fly-in fly-out workforce model either,\" he said.\n\nThe NT government wants to see fly-in fly-out workers settle in the territory. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nMr Yan said home ownership initiatives such as the HomeGrown Territory Grants program made the dream of living and working in the territory a possibility.\n\n\"We know all too well that once you've bought a house and you've got a mortgage, you put down roots in the place where you live,\" he said.\n\nThe scheme offers first-home buyers $50,000 to build or buy a new home on the condition that they continue living in the Northern Territory.\n\nThe government is offering incentives for people to build homes in the NT. (ABC News: Jack Hislop )\n\nProfessor Taylor agreed that buying a house increases the likelihood of people staying long-term, but had reservations about scrapping FIFO work.\n\n\"You can't really force people to settle long-term in the territory if that's not part of their plan for themselves and their families,\" he said.\n\n\"We've always been high employers of non-resident workers and I can't really see that discontinuing.\"\n\nWhat about the 'soft factors'?\n\nAccording to Professor Taylor, the answer to the territory's population trouble could be what demographers refer to as \"soft factors\".\n\nHe said while jobs and homes might attract workers to the economy, the key to retaining the territory's population was a matter of residents feeling connected to the communities in which they reside.\n\n\"Encouraging the formation of social networks, getting people engaged with the community and embedded in the community through social activities are shown to be important in retaining people beyond just two years in the territory.\"\n\nNT experiencing interstate population drain Photo shows Woman and dog sit on grass and smile at camera in backyard The Northern Territory is losing thousands more residents interstate than it's gaining, meaning the jurisdiction is set to miss its 2030 population target of 300,000 people.\n\nProfessor Taylor also noted the multicultural make-up of the territory was an asset when it came to retaining international migrants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Territory opposition has pointed to better work conditions as a means of keeping workers.\n\nOpposition Leader Selena Uibo noted that on the day the CLP announced its population targets, it was also seeking to repeal portable long-service leave for community service workers.\n\n'We are not going to see people stay in the Northern Territory if they can get the work entitlements that they have been offered in other jurisdictions,\" the Territory Labor leader said.",

(Supplied: Shane Wendleborne)\n\nLongreach veterinarian Jordan Stayt said while not all mosquitoes carried the disease, the risk of BEF infiltrating herds was significantly higher after a flood event.\n\nHe said the disease caused lameness, stiffness, depression, runny nose, drooling, high fevers, and in serious cases, death in cattle.\n\nThe long-term effects could impact the reproductive health of livestock, causing permanent infertility in bulls and increasing the likelihood of pregnant cows aborting their fetuses.\n\nCattle across western Queensland are at risk of a deadly disease as floodwaters recede.

They'll be up your nose, in your ears, just everywhere,\" she said.\n\n\"There's nothing really you can do \u2026 it's par for the course.\"\n\nHer plan was to keep her cattle in one place while she waited for the impending sandfly and mosquito swarms.\n\nDrooling is a symptom bovine ephemeral fever, known as the three-day sickness. (Supplied: Ulladulla Veterinary Hospital)\n\n\"The less they're disturbed the better \u2026 if you try and move them, well, they will die,\" she said.\n\nShe said some cattle would contract three-day sickness but many of her bulls were vaccinated.\n\n\"It's a bit like people getting the flu in a way, because not everybody gets the flu as bad as the next person,\" she said.\n\nAbout 300 kilometres south of Ms Groves, grazier at Pinkenetta Station near Quilpie, Alex Edwards, said the mosquitoes were likely hatching and batches of them would live amongst the livestock.\n\nPinketta Station was inundated by record-breaking flooding. (Supplied: Alex Edwards)\n\n\"The sandflies are going to be a big [issue], and the mosquitoes,\" Mr Edwards said.\n\n\"The poor old animals that are caught for a little bit longer \u2026 they'll suffer.\"\n\nHe said the last significant outbreaks of BEF occurred during the 2016 and 2019 floods, where sandflies were rampant, and many newcomers to the region may not be prepared for what was to come.\n\n\"The tragic part about this is it doesn't matter what you injected them with, you weren't going to save them,\" he said.\n\n\" What diseases come along now, I just hope and pray they don't affect the ones that are still alive. \"\n\nFloodwater reaches to the top of trees on a property in western Queensland. (Supplied: Kylie Smith)\n\nIn for the long haul\n\nDr Stayt said if BEF hit large numbers in cattle herds, reducing production, there might be serious flow-on effects for graziers.\n\n\"The animals are probably going to be struggling, it might take them a little longer to get over it and knock them around a bit more,\" he said.\n\nJordan Stayt says three-day sickness could threaten the lives of cattle in the wake of flooding in western Queensland. (Supplied: Jordan Stayt)\n\n\" Their bodies are going to be taking a pretty large physiological load right now \u2026 once they do get saved from the flooding itself. \"\n\nHe said the largest long-term impacts would be if infertility of loss of fetuses became an issue, putting the future of the already decreased herd at risk.\n\nThe management of clinical cases includes the symptomatic treatment of infected cattle, including anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and vaccinations in the face of an outbreak.\n\n\"There's no cure as such, but nursing care is definitely beneficial,\" he said.",

        "text": "Michael Malone coached the Denver Nuggets to the NBA title in 2023. He has them set to make the postseason for a seventh consecutive year. Even amid a four-game slide, they are still in position to have home-court advantage in the first round of.\n\nBut he is gone with three games left \u2014 an unprecedented move for a club bound for the playoffs.\n\nThe Nuggets fired Malone early on Wednesday morning AEST, a stunning move that comes with less than a week in the regular season. Also out: general manager Calvin Booth, whose contract will not be renewed. The Nuggets said David Adelman would be the coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nJosh Kroenke, the vice-chairman of Kroenke Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Nuggets, said it was \"with no pleasure\" that the team made the change at coach.\n\n\"This decision was not made lightly and was evaluated very carefully, and we do it only with the intention of giving our group the best chance at competing for the 2025 NBA championship and delivering another title to Denver and our fans everywhere,\" Kroenke said.\n\nThere's never been an instance in NBA history of a team officially changing coaches with three games left and going to the postseason; the Nuggets are not in the playoffs yet but are assured of a play-in berth at worst.\n\nThe latest in-season change for a playoff team before now was in 1983 when Larry Brown left the New Jersey Nets with six games left to take over at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe Nuggets are 47-32 this season but are part of a logjam of teams fighting for home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Denver won the title in 2023 and lost a game seven at home in the Western Conference semifinals a year ago to Minnesota.\n\nMalone pointed the finger at himself after the most recent loss, a 125-120 defeat to Indiana on Sunday.\n\n\"I'll start with me: We've lost four games in a row and I'm never going to this guy, that guy. How about me, as a head coach, not doing my job to the best of my ability,\" Malone said.\n\n\"We haven't lost four in a row in a long time. It's really easy to be together and say 'family' when you win, but when you're losing games, can you stay together?\"\n\nThe slide comes despite Nuggets star Nikola Jokic \u2014 a winner of three of the past four NBA MVP awards \u2014 having a historic season, averaging 30 points, 12.8 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game. But even that was not good enough for Denver to enter the final week of the season certain of having the home court in the first round.\n\nAfter that loss to the Pacers, Jokic was asked his biggest concern with the team right now.\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe we just, maybe we just \u2026 I don't know, actually,\" Jokic said.\n\nThe Nuggets are hoping a shake-up might provide the answer.\n\nMalone had the fourth-longest tenure of any active NBA coach, behind San Antonio's Gregg Popovich, Miami's Erik Spoelstra and Golden State's Steve Kerr.\n\nMalone pictured with the Larry O'Brien trophy after Denver's NBA title win in 2023. (Getty Images: Bart Young)\n\nMalone won 471 regular-season games in Denver, 39 more than Doug Moe for the franchise's all-time coaching lead.\n\n\"While the timing of this decision is unfortunate, as Coach Malone helped build the foundation of our now championship-level program, it is a necessary step to allow us to compete at the highest level right now,\" Kroenke said.\n\n\"Championship-level standards and expectations remain in place for the current season, and as we look to the future, we look forward to building on the foundations laid by Coach Malone over his record-breaking 10-year career in Denver.\"\n\nMalone had consistent success in Denver. The Nuggets finished with losing records in his first two seasons and posted winning records in his next eight years with the club.\n\nThis season's postseason appearance will be the team's seventh in a row; it has not clinched a playoff berth yet this season but is assured of finishing no worse than in the play-in tournament.\n\nStarting with the first playoff appearance under Malone in 2019, the Nuggets got out of the first round six times in seven chances. They made the Western Conference finals in the Walt Disney World bubble in 2020 and then rolled to the championship by winning 16 of 20 playoff games in 2023.\n\nThe Nuggets are also in the market for a new general manager after Calvin Booth (left) was told his contract would not be renewed. (Getty Images: Aaron Ontiveroz)\n\nIt is the second time in the past two weeks that a postseason-bound team has fired a coach. Memphis \u2014 another team assured of at least a play-in spot \u2014 dismissed Taylor Jenkins late last month with nine games left in the season, replacing him with Tuomas Iisalo on an interim basis.\n\nThe Nets parted ways with Brown (officially he resigned) with six games left in 1982-83, and the Nets \u2014 now in Brooklyn \u2014 replaced Kenny Atkinson with Jacque Vaughn for the final 10 games of the 2019-20 \"bubble\" season. The 1983 Nets and 2020 Nets went a combined 0-6 in playoff games after the coaching changes; time will tell what happens with the Grizzlies and Nuggets this year.\n\nBooth came to Denver in 2017 as an assistant general manager and was promoted to GM in July 2020. He signed his most recent contract with the club in 2022.\n\nKroenke credited Booth \"for helping put the final pieces in place for the roster that delivered Denver and our fans their first NBA championship\".\n\n\"Calvin's knowledge of the game, his passion for scouting, and his long history as a player and executive in the NBA helped lift our organisation to new heights which we will continue moving forward,\" Kroenke said.\n\nThe Nuggets play in Sacramento on Thursday AEST.\n\nAP",

        "text": "While Australia eliminated local transmission of measles in 2014, a recent rise in cases globally has seen a local surge of the highly contagious viral illness.\n\nOnly a quarter of the way into 2025, Australia has already recorded 53 measles cases \u2014 almost as many as the total recorded across all of last year (57).\n\nMeasles symptoms Fever\n\nFeeling unwell or tired\n\nCough\n\nRunny nose\n\nSore and red eyes (conjunctivitis)\n\nDiarrhoea (especially in infants)\n\nSwollen lymph nodes\n\nKoplik spots (tiny white, grey, red or bluish spots inside the mouth)\n\nRed, blotchy, non-itchy rash that starts on the face and neck and spreads down the body Source: Better Health Channel\n\nMost cases occur in people returning from overseas, including to popular holiday destinations like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, which are currently experiencing measles outbreaks.\n\nBut in recent weeks, a growing number of infections have been detected among Australians who haven't been overseas or in contact with anyone who has, Kristine Macartney, director of the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said.\n\n\" We're seeing cases pop up that represent undetected transmission in the community, and this is exactly what we don't want to see. \"\n\nMeasles primarily affects children, and declining childhood vaccination rates have prompted calls for parents to ensure their kids are vaccinated.\n\nBut adults can also catch and spread the disease, especially if they are undervaccinated \u2014 a category many Australians might find themselves in.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWho should be vaccinated against measles?\n\nMeasles is a potentially serious illness that can lead to long-term health complications, hospitalisation, and even death.\n\nIn Australia, children are routinely vaccinated against the measles virus at 12 months of age (along with mumps and rubella), and again at 18 months (in combination with the chickenpox vaccine).\n\nBut measles vaccination is also recommended for people born during or since 1966 who have not received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, particularly if they are:\n\nhealthcare workers\n\nchildhood educators and carers\n\npeople who work in long-term care facilities\n\npeople who work in correctional facilities\n\nplanning to travel overseas.\n\nPrior to 1966, the measles virus circulated widely in the community and most people who lived during this time are assumed to have acquired immunity from natural infection.\n\nBut Australians born between 1966 and 1994 are considered at greater risk of measles because they are less likely to have acquired natural immunity, and may have had just one dose of the vaccine.\n\nNew concerns about measles Photo shows A child with day four measles rash. Health departments around the country are warning Australians to be alert for symptoms of measles as concerns grow about a rise in cases amid declining vaccination rates.\n\nThis is because it wasn't until the early '90s that a second measles dose \u2014 which increases protection from roughly 95 to 99 per cent \u2014 was added to the national childhood immunisation schedule.\n\n\"[Before this] you were only recommended to have one dose, which isn't completely protective,\" Professor Macartney said.\n\n\"The second dose also boosts your immunity over a longer period of time.\"\n\nA number of school-based, catch-up programs were run in the mid and late 1990s to increase immunisation rates, but Professor Macartney said many Australians aged in their mid 30s to early 60s are likely to have had only one dose.\n\n\"We know from previous antibody surveys of the population that this age group has lower levels of immunity to measles than is ideal,\" she said.\n\nSome adults who have migrated to Australia may have also had only one dose (or none) and are also recommended for vaccination.\n\nHow do I know if I've been vaccinated against measles?\n\nOne way to check your immunisation history is through the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which you can access through a myGov or Medicare online account.\n\nThe AIR is a national register which records vaccines given to people of all ages in Australia. It was, however, only established in 1996 \u2014 and initially only for childhood vaccinations \u2014 which means it may be incomplete for many adults.\n\nAnother way to check your immunisation history is to look at your personal health records (e.g. a baby book), or contact your GP or local council, which may have a record of your vaccinations.\n\nIs it safe to get another vaccine if I'm not sure?\n\nYes (unless you're someone who should not normally receive a measles vaccine \u2014 see below).\n\n\"There's absolutely no harm at all in having a measles vaccine if you've already had two doses. It's a very safe vaccine,\" Professor Macartney said.\n\n\"And if you think you've never had a dose at all, then we recommend two doses four weeks apart.\"\n\nBlood tests to check for antibody levels to the measles virus can be helpful to determine whether someone has immunity (either from infection or previous vaccination).\n\nMeasles can damage the immune system by \"deleting\" its memory of how to fight infections. (Getty Images: Natalya Maisheva)\n\nBut since there are no increases in adverse events from vaccinating people with pre-existing immunity, Professor Macartney recommends people who are unsure just \"go ahead and get an extra dose\".\n\n\"It's something people should certainly consider if they're going travelling, but also if they're here in Australia, because of the risk of others bringing measles in.\"\n\nCatch-up measles vaccines are available at most GPs, community health centres, Aboriginal Medical Services and pharmacies, and may be free of charge depending on your age, location and vaccination history.\n\nWho shouldn't be vaccinated against measles?\n\nBecause the measles vaccine contains a small amount of the live virus, there are some people who should not be vaccinated. This includes:\n\ninfants under six months of age\n\npregnant women\n\npeople who are immunocompromised\n\npeople with a history of anaphylaxis to any measles-containing vaccine (or its components).\n\nThe safety of these individuals depends on high rates of community immunisation, Professor Macartney said.\n\n\"This is why it's so important we don't have measles spreading around because there are individuals who cannot receive the vaccine and are more vulnerable to becoming ill.\"\n\nWhile immunisation rates remain high in Australia, they have slightly decreased in recent years, and remain below the World Health Organization target rate of 95 per cent.\n\nIt's also important to note that while infants aged 6\u201312 months are not routinely recommended for vaccination, those travelling overseas to places where measles is circulating can safely be given a pre-travel dose. They will still require another two doses later.\n\nWhat if I've been exposed to measles?\n\nIf you think you've been exposed to measles, you should monitor for symptoms, especially if you aren't fully vaccinated, and seek medical care if you become unwell.\n\nIf you plan on attending a healthcare facility, call ahead so you can be isolated on arrival (and avoid spreading the virus to others).\n\nMeasles usually starts with cold-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, runny nose, and sore or red eyes, which can develop 7 to 18 days after exposure.\n\nABC Health in your Instagram feed Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.\n\n\"What happens is the fever comes up before the rash \u2026 and you're contagious at that point, so people often don't realise it could be measles and that's where the spread of the virus occurs,\" Professor Macartney said.\n\nAs a precaution, it's a good idea to avoid anyone who might be at risk of serious illness, including infants, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system, until 18 days after your exposure.\n\n\"For people who have a reduced immune system, there's also the possibility of getting an antibody immunoglobulin injection if they've been exposed, and that can help them to reduce getting measles,\" Professor Macartney said.\n\nSimilarly, an immunoglobulin injection or measles vaccine can sometimes be administered after exposure to people who are undervaccinated, but needs to be done within a few days of exposure.",

        "text": "Mitch Marsh has continued to enjoy an Indian summer in the Indian Premier League, with the 33-year-old opener cracking his fourth half-century in five innings as the Lucknow Super Giants edged a thriller against the Kolkata Knight Riders by just four runs in a match which saw both teams combine for 472 runs.\n\nMarsh smashed a 48-ball 81 containing five sixes as LSG piled up 3-238 in their 20 overs.\n\nThe Australian was well supported by South African Aiden Markram (47 off 28) in a 99-run opening partnership, then West Indies' Nicholas Pooran (87 not out off 36), with whom he added 71 in five overs before holing out at deep point.\n\nWith 265 runs at 53, Marsh briefly became the tournament's highest scorer, but did not get to don the orange cap as he was overtaken in the same innings by Pooran.\n\nThe innings of the day came, however, in Tuesday's second match when Priyansh Arya punished Chennai Super Kings for spurning four chances to catch him by battering an astonishing 39-ball century featuring nine sixes, an innings all the more remarkable for the rest of the top six making 23 between them.\n\nThat included Marcus Stoinis (4) and Glenn Maxwell (brilliantly caught and bowled for one by Ravi Ashwin), before Shashank Singh (52 off 36) provided support. That enabled Ricky Ponting's Punjab Kings, at one stage 5-85, to reach 6-219, Arya making 103 of them.\n\nThat was too much for CSK, even with the legendary MS Dhoni coming to the crease \u2014 to huge excitement even at the away venue of New Chandigarh \u2014 with CSK needing 68 off 25 balls.\n\nDhoni survived an umpire's call LBW and a run out chance to Stoinis to hit successive sixes off Lockie Ferguson \u2014 in between which Devon Conway was retired for 69 off 49 balls. Dhoni hit another six but was then caught for 27 off 12 and CSK's hopes went with him, the innings closing on 5-201.\n\nEarlier at Eden Gardens, Spencer Johnson was one of the bowlers hammered by Marsh, his three overs going for 46 without reward.\n\nYet Kolkata were on the verge of overhauling the huge target after captain Ajinkya Rahane blazed 61 off 35 balls and Venkatesh Iyer 45 off 29.\n\nThere were 24 required off the final over. Rinku Singh clubbed three boundaries and a six but came up one boundary short.\n\nLucknow and Punjab now join three other teams on six points, headed by Delhi Capitals, the only unbeaten team left.\n\nAAP",

(ABC North Queensland: Georgia Loney)\n\nThe Queensland government said construction of the power line in Hughenden would begin this year, but has not committed to a date.\n\nHughenden Chamber of Commerce secretary Aaron Zammitt said businesses had been banking on a further influx of workers in the near future.\n\nHe understood the rationale behind proposed changes but said it was time to \"get on with it\".\n\n\"We want to see 300 to 500 people moving to town,\" he said.\n\nAaron Zammitt says construction needs to get underway for CopperString.

        "text": "For fans with blindness and low vision, the tactile sports broadcast could be a game changer.\n\nIts premise is simple: instead of watching a match with your eyes, you're feeling it through your hands.\n\nAround the world, a handful of companies have found ways to enable this technology, including US start-up OneCourt, whose 'haptic display' is a rectangular, tablet sized device.\n\nUsers place their hands on its surface, through which real-time, sport-specific information is conveyed through a collection of vibrating motors.\n\nIn tennis and basketball, you're 'feeling' the ball as it travels from one side of the court to the other, while in baseball, your left hand is tracking the play as the batter rounds the bases and your right is viewing a \"strike zone\" that conveys information about each ball pitched.\n\nOneCourt's device at a baseball game, featuring the diamond on the left and strike zone on the right. (Supplied: OneCourt)\n\nAlthough the technology is still in its infancy, this season it has made its courtside debut at the home games of three NBA teams at no additional cost to fans.\n\nThe OneCourt device used at basketball games. (Supplied: OneCourt)\n\nCloser to home, Field of Vision became the first company to trial similar technology in Australia, with some fans at Docklands offered the opportunity to track AFL games through haptics.\n\nUnlike the OneCourt technology, where specific areas of the device vibrate in turn, Field of Vision conveys its haptic information through a magnetic ring.\n\nThat ring travels across a handheld, model field, tracing the movement of the ball and signalling specific, game-state vibrations.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThe audio component of sports broadcasting is changing as well, with the development of designed spatialised soundscapes helping to convey what is often missed by commentators.\n\nFor fans with a vision impairment, such technology has the potential to revolutionise the way sport is consumed. But for the wider population, does the future of sports entertainment lay beyond sight?\n\nHaptic technology won't replace audio, but augment it\n\nHaptic technology is designed to work alongside either a radio broadcast or audio descriptive commentary (ADC).\n\nADC is offered at an increasing number of stadiums across the world and allows for fans with blindness and low vision to more closely follow a game by painting a detailed verbal image of what's happening on field.\n\nAccording to OneCourt CEO Jerred Mace, haptic technology and ADC work well in tandem because audio and touch are best suited to conveying different kinds of information.\n\n\"We're never going to communicate player names through haptics. It's just not what touch is good at,\" Mace told ABC Sport.\n\n\"And in the same way, it's hard to communicate spatial information through audio, especially in sports, because as soon as you describe the position of a tennis ball, it has already changed.\"\n\nMace, right, founded OneCourt with a group of friends while still at university. (Supplied: OneCourt)\n\nEach OneCourt device features headphone connectivity through which fans can listen along to an audio broadcast as they feel the game through their hands.\n\nFor some environments in which ADC or radio commentary isn't available, OneCourt offers users a short-form radio broadcast that is generated, in real time, from the same information used for its haptics.\n\nThis allows for fans, especially those with vision impairments, to have more agency over their experiences taking in sport.\n\n\"Some low-vision users lean into the tactile and some don't,\" Mace said.\n\n\"Some are focused on magnification \u2026 [and] we have had many fans that say 'hey, I just want the audio'.\"\n\nHaptic technology is designed to be used alongside an audio broadcast. (Supplied: OneCourt)\n\nHow spatial audio can make sound more useful\n\nThe audio components of traditional sports broadcasting, particularly on television, go largely unquestioned.\n\nCommentary often adds colour and emotion to proceedings and, at its best, is both informative and interesting.\n\nBut Tim Devine, executive creative director of augmented audio company Action Audio, says the sonic potential of sport remains mostly untapped.\n\n\"If you think about the sound in a Marvel film or a Batman film, it's intense and very intricate and expressive,\" Devine told ABC Sport.\n\n\"And what happens in sports is maybe not as intense, but it's still not represented as well as it could be from an audio perspective.\"\n\nDevine presented Action Audio to the NBA Summer League. (Supplied: Action Audio)\n\nAction Audio works with blind and low-vision sports fans to determine what information is missing from sports broadcasts. That missing information is then translated into a spatial soundscape, with in-game actions being represented by designed sound effects.\n\nThe service made its courtside debut at a major tennis tournament two years ago, where users wore a single mono earpiece.\n\nDuring this trial, the movement of the ball was represented by a synthetic 'rattle' sound reminiscent of the audible ball used in blind tennis. The force with which the ball was hit, its closeness to the line and the shot type were all also sonified.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn the coming months, Action Audio will trial its service with one of the world's major basketball leagues, with a sonic language drastically different to the one designed for tennis.\n\nDuring Action Audio's research into basketball commentary, Devine found there was often a rather conspicuous absentee.\n\n\"What came out, was the ball is missing,\" Devine said.\n\n\"There are so many stars in basketball, but the ball is really the focus.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Which seems obvious, but it's also not, as the commentators don't really surface it as much as they could.\"\n\nSo, the basketball soundscape largely centres around the ball's movement \u2014 when it bounces, when it is passed and its velocity.\n\nThere are also different sounds used for when one-, two- and three-point shots are taken, as well as a success sound for a score and a separate signal for a slam dunk.\n\nFrom the stadium to the living room\n\nThe development of augmented soundscapes and haptic broadcasting has been made possible by the amount of data now collected by major sports leagues.\n\n\"Why didn't this happen five years ago? I think the real answer to that, in my opinion, is the data infrastructure,\" Mace said.\n\n\"Right now, leagues and teams, they're collecting so much data.\n\n\"They know exactly where the ball is, where the players are, and I think people underestimate how precise it is and also how fast it is.\"\n\nThis means that courtside at NBA games, OneCourt devices experience latencies of less than half a second.\n\nOneCourt's haptic device is currently available at the home games of the Sacremento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Portland Trail Blazers. (Supplied: OneCourt)\n\nAlthough the service is only currently available at a select few sporting venues in North America, Mace says the product's future is as much in the home as it is in the stadium.\n\nHe is hopeful the technology will be available in-home as early as 2026 and will initially cost \"around the same price as a cell phone\".\n\nAction Audio is also making tentative steps towards the living room.\n\nFor both companies, perhaps the biggest challenge for making the leap into homes is that of broadcasting rights and how they will be sold.\n\nIt's uncharted territory; never before have the tactile or spatial audio rights to a sports league been sold.\n\nBut Mace says it's a possibility leagues have been more than happy to consider.\n\n\"The leagues love it, because they have sold their visual rights, they have sold their audio rights, and now here we are telling them 'hey, here's a totally new area of broadcasting',\" Mace said.\n\n\"They're really excited about it, and we'll definitely make it happen.\"\n\nMace hopes OneCourt could enter homes in 2026. (Getty Images: Inti St Clair)\n\nThe immediacy of sporting experience\n\nIn all aspects of life, people with vision impairments are accustomed to reacting after the fact.\n\nIn a sporting context, that means being told what type of shot a batter has played in cricket, or knowing a footballer has scored a goal through the roar of the crowd.\n\nBoth Mace and Devine say they were very prepared for their products to fail, or to not be of use to fans with blindness and low vision.\n\nBut for both technologies, the reliable provision of immediate sporting experience has already proved revolutionary for vision impaired fans and, for the most part, the most basic information has made all the difference.\n\n\"One of the bits of feedback that we've got was that the really simple stuff we're providing \u2014 how close the ball is to the line, what shot type it is, who hit the ball \u2014 enabled people to feel like they knew what had happened,\" Devine said.\n\n\"So they felt really wrapped up in all the emotions like everybody else.\"",

Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui\n\nDaniel is declaring her donations in real time on her campaign website, and, as of Tuesday, had raised $1,613,365.\n\nThe donations are led by the fundraising body Climate 200, convened by clean energy investor Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, which has contributed around $450,000 in 11 separate tranches.\n\nOther big donations include $100,000 from Keldoulis Investments, owned by share trader Robert Keldoulis, who is also a big backer of Climate 200, and $66,000 from Keep Them Honest Pty Ltd, a company registered to a $13 million Darling Point residence owned by Fred Woollard, founder of boutique fund Samuel Terry Asset Management.\n\nLoading\n\nWoollard also made a personal donation of $16,000 to Daniel\u2019s campaign.\n\nWoollard has come under scrutiny for his links to fossil fuel, due to his fund\u2019s significant investments in Horizon Oil and US-based Diamond Offshore Drilling.\n\nBut the majority of the donations to Daniel\u2019s campaign are for smaller amounts, with more than 3101 individual donations.\n\nIn the last election Daniel raised $1.745 million, with Climate 200 donations comprising $710,000, or 41 per cent of the total raised.\n\nWilson defended his decision not to disclose who is donating to his campaign or the amount he has raised.\n\n\u201cOur campaign comes from the community, not from Climate 200,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe comply with electoral donations laws and we\u2019ve raised our money overwhelmingly from the Goldstein community.\u201d\n\nWilson said his fundraising efforts for the campaign were going well.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cMany people who have never donated before \u2026 have now decided for the first time that they need to donate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve realised they don\u2019t have the luxury of just assuming that we\u2019re going to win Goldstein.\u201d\n\nJoo-Cheong Tham, a professor at Melbourne Law School and director of the Centre for Public Integrity, said the current disclosure scheme for electoral donations \u201cis effectively a non-disclosure scheme\u201d.\n\nTham said close to half the donations made to major parties in the last financial year were \u201cdark money\u201d that was not itemised or attributed, and that it often took almost 18 months for donations to be disclosed.\n\nTham said real-time disclosure, which is being undertaken voluntarily by Daniel, will be required for the next federal election, but until then, voters will be mainly left in the dark about the origins of campaign funds.\n\n\u201cPeople need to know who pays the piper \u2026 for their vote to be an informed vote,\u201d he said.\n\nTham said it was concerning that an increasing amount of money was being spent on tightly contested seats.\n\n\u201cThese are multimillion-dollar contests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem with that is that it becomes an informal barrier to entry.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size \u201cSometimes I get there, and my hands just shake\u201d. If there is a quote that better captures the charming terror of the 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Course \u2013 home of the US Masters \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been uttered yet. The man who delivered the line is none other Jack Nicklaus, who is arguably the greatest golfer to ever play the game. The \u201cGolden Bear\u201d won 117 tournaments in his career, including a record 18 majors. Heck, Nicklaus won a peerless six Masters titles - and even he is scared of the 12th stop on a course he tamed more often than anyone else in history. So why does a postcard pretty par-three in the far corner of golf\u2019s most famous course, sitting on the edge of Raes Creek and framed by pink azaleas and dogwood trees, elicit such fear, even for Nicklaus? It\u2019s not just that Nicklaus could have had a Green Jacket for every day of the week had he not double-bogeyed no.12 in 1981.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the fact that Nicklaus is only one famous name on a very long list of star golfers, spanning 88 years, who also had their chances of victory blown up by a disastrous visit to the shortest hole of Augusta National. It is such a long list that the best option is to just start with the legends and infer the rest: luminaries like Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Gene Sarazen, Payne Stewart, Gary Player and even Tiger Woods. More recently Jordan Spieth\u2019s entire tournament imploded at no.12, and Rory McIroy and Cam Smith have sunk there too. And as the US Masters unfolds this week, the safest bet you can make is the hole will claim more victims - and probably the chances of a leading contender on Sunday, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest hole in tournament golf,\u201d Nicklaus said. Amen Corner The curious part about the murderous nature of the 12th is how innocent it appears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom tee to the front of the green is a casual 130 metres, and while that was a longer iron shot in Nicklaus\u2019 day, modern players can usually hit a green from that distance with a laser-guided wedge. So far, so good. But the hole is as treacherous as it is beautiful. It is golf\u2019s Mata Hari. The 12th hole is cut by Raes Creek, and to safely land on the green, players have to carry the water and a bunker sitting at the front edge. Cameron Smith tees off towards the 12th green at Augusta National in 2022. Credit: AP The next layer of difficulty is the size and shape of the green, designed in 1934 by Bobby Jones and Alistair MacKenzie (the latter a famed course designer who also built Royal Melbourne). The green is not only angled away from the tee, it is particularly narrow - about 10 metres in width - and getting a ball to stop on it requires a perfectly chosen club, and a perfectly struck shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHitting too long is bad news, as well, with thick shrubbery and downhill slopes out the back. But even if you hit your tee shot crisply, the third layer of difficulty is the unpredictability of the wind at the southern pocket of the course, which was dubbed \u201cAmen Corner\u201d in the 1950s by sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind. In a sport of mathematical precision and certainty, this is a corner where prayer is also embraced because the wind is often impossible to account for. Pros say the wind gusts and spirals in devilish ways, particularly above the tree line. Green machine: Arnold Palmer (left) helps Jack Nicklaus into another green jacket after Nicklaus' nine-stroke victory at the Masters in 1965. Credit: AP \u201cThey did studies on it and it\u2019s called the \u2018eddy effect\u2019,\u201d Bubba Watson said in 2020. \u201cIf you get a gust, it actually doubles the speed but you just don\u2019t know it. That\u2019s why you see some balls come up short and you\u2019re like \u2018Did that guy really just misclub by two clubs?\u2019.\u201d After putting a ball in the drink in the last round of 2019, Brooks Koepka said: \u201cOnce it gets above those trees, it\u2019s a guessing game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal knowledge helps, and there are umpteen tips and caddy\u2019s tales about how to gauge the wind. Many of the old legends waited until the flags on the 11th green, to the left of the 12th tee, blew downwind before they hit. Others waited until the tops of the trees to the right of the 12th green swayed a certain way. But prayer is as good a strategy as any. In 2013, Watson returned as the defending champion and hit a 10 at the 12th. And the hole is easier for left-handers. Ky Laffoon plays a shot at the edge of Raes Creek in the 1930s. Credit: Augusta National/Getty Images If you land in the water, the fourth layer of hell is the drop zone is back up the fairway, requiring an awkward lofted chip that still needs to clear water and stop on a dime. But you dare not spin the ball too much, because once a ball starts rolling down the 1.2 metre slope to the creek, you\u2019re cooked - again. \u201cThe very simple answer as to why it is so hard is that there is no good miss, there is no bail out,\u201d said former Open champion, turned leading golf commentator, Ian Baker-Finch. \u201cYou have to have the correct club. Most holes, most greens, most par threes offer an option. When the green is so narrow - from memory it is 14 paces from the front to the back, in the centre of the green - you just have to have the right club. You can\u2019t get away with not having the right club. \u201cSo there is a lot of pressure. Then you have to decide on the direction of the wind, and even on a calm day there is always something going on down there in the bottom corner\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Investors have been holding their hands to their throats for months as the spectacle of a once cocky casino company lurching towards its demise played out before them. The Star Entertainment Group\u2019s chief executive Steve McCann had flogged assets, sold out of Brisbane, squeezed the government for regulatory mercy and nearly secured a long-term funding deal, only to come up short. But as the company trickled down to its final dollar of cash, the former professional poker player had one more card in his hand. US casino giant Bally\u2019s Corporation, a self-described \u201cbuyer of last resort\u201d whose advances Star had previously rebuffed, now offered $300 million in funding in exchange for control of the company. This time, McCann signed. Introducing mandatory carded play in October was the final, fatal blow to Star\u2019s casino in Sydney. Credit: Louise Kennerley The rescue deal will come as a relief to Star\u2019s 9000 employees and the NSW government, which company insiders privately blame for its travails. Among Star\u2019s many injuries, the NSW government order for its Sydney casino to stop accepting cash from October last year threatened to be the fatal blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new cashless gambling regime required the casino to conduct extensive \u201cknow your customer\u201d checks on its patrons, and revenue dropped immediately and sharply after it was introduced. Too many of Star\u2019s customers did not wish to be known. Less than 400 metres down the road from the Sydney casino, Pyrmont Bridge Hotel has 19 poker machines where customers can play anonymously. It jumped 100 places up the state rankings by gaming machine net profit in the quarter after the changes at Star took effect. It is a dizzying turn of events for a company that less than four years ago was openly floating a $12 billion takeover of its weakened rival, Crown Resorts. When Star shares went into a trading halt this year, plenty of pundits envisaged a scenario where Crown bought the jewel in Star\u2019s portfolio \u2013 the Sydney casino \u2013 and with it the poker machine licences that would reverse its own fortunes. It will now be up to Bally\u2019s to return Star to profitability in a regulatory environment where it continues to be the only poker machine operator in Sydney that is not allowed to accept cash. The NSW Independent Casino Commission chief commissioner Philip Crawford said on Tuesday he had begun a probity assessment of Bally\u2019s Corporation and was continuing to work with Star on remediation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Lee, managing partner of IGamiX Management and Consulting, said the NSW government\u2019s lopsided approach to gambling regulation suggested cashless gaming was being used as a punishment rather than a wholesale attempt to prevent money laundering. \u201cI think a lot of people were naive about the intention of the NSW authorities,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realise the depth of antipathy that the NSW government had for Star, and it\u2019s come to this point where Star and its representatives and even suitors like Bally\u2019s have no clear indication as to what the path is to recovery.\u201d Back in 2015, when Echo Entertainment rebranded itself to become The Star Entertainment Group, the company had a thriving market in Asian high rollers and the confidence to submit a $2.6 billion three-way bid to develop the Queens Wharf precinct that would be central to the Queensland government\u2019s revitalisation of the Brisbane CBD and accommodation of the 2032 Olympic Games. The arrival of Crown, with a tower in Barangaroo, added to the Star casino\u2019s woes. Credit: Wolter Peeters Two years earlier, the company had come off second best in a bruising contest with Crown, whose chairman, James Packer, had won government approval to operate a competing casino in NSW and was developing a luxury hotel at Barangaroo. But Star had leveraged this to its benefit by securing government funding to develop its own resort-style entertainment complex in Pyrmont. It was on the ascent. The business model developed by Crown and mimicked by Star was the cultivation of Chinese high rollers who were moving their private capital offshore on gambling tour groups known as junkets. In February 2018, Star\u2019s market capitalisation reached a high-water mark of $5 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch was Star\u2019s chutzpah that it continued to aggressively pursue the VIP market even after The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed in 2019 that one of its major partners, the junket operator Suncity, was linked to organised crime. It did not pivot its business then, or in 2020 when the Bergin inquiry into Crown Resorts that resulted from those media reports uncovered breaches of anti-money laundering requirements so flagrant that Crown was deemed unfit to operate a Sydney casino. Instead, as the Bell inquiry was later to learn, Star became good at covering its tracks. It removed Suncity\u2019s branding from its private gaming salon, where bags of cash persisted and which continued to be operated for the junket operator\u2019s exclusive use. It disregarded independent audits of its money laundering systems, misled banks and helped Chinese high rollers to disguise their gambling expenses. Only when Star, too, was exposed by the media in 2021, and Adam Bell, SC, made his damning findings, did Star cease its association with some of the organised criminals, tax cheats and corporate fraudsters who were using its premises to clean their dirty cash. By this time, the high-roller market had dried up in the aftermath of COVID-19 and amid a crackdown by Chinese authorities. But the NSW government announced sweeping new regulations to be imposed on the company, including mandatory carded play, extensive due diligence on patrons, and $1000 cash limits. Then casino regulator fined the enfeebled company $100 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Star casino and Queens Wharf complex in Brisbane. Credit: Glenn Campbell Star\u2019s luck had turned. The cost of the Queens Wharf development had blown out by $1 billion, and one of Star\u2019s partners in that project, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, was facing probity questions. Star\u2019s saving grace was the willingness of the Queensland government, which was counting on the taxes to be generated by the casino, to dismiss concerns that Chow Tai Fook had misled regulators over its links to underworld figures as a misunderstanding. However, the alleged links between Chow Tai Fook and organised crime ruled it out of rescuing Star in NSW, where any ownership stake greater than 10 per cent would trigger probity checks. Loading The NSW Independent Casino Commission then ordered a second inquiry into Star last year, resulting in a $15 million fine for compliance breaches. Star successfully argued for the cash limit to stay at $5000 for 12 more months and for cardless play to be delayed from August until October 2024. But the change when it finally arrived was immediate. Addressing shareholders in November, chief executive Steve McCann disclosed that daily average revenue was down 15.5 per cent compared with the four weeks before cardless play took effect. It was clear the casino had lost market share, he said.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "When Longmire first came here in 2002 as an assistant to Paul Roos, the AFL was simply not cool. \u201cI went out for lunch when I moved up here, I sat next to a school principal, and I said, \u2018How\u2019s your AFL program going?\u2019 And he started laughing at me,\u201d he says. Now, the Swans feel organically Sydney. They have the biggest crowds of any team in the city. Their games have become social events among the eastern suburbs set. And on the field they have been a formidable side for more than two decades. The burrata at The Paddington on Oxford Street. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer Longmire lets me handle the food. Suits me fine. For our starter, I go with some bread, butter and burrata, with rockmelon and prosciutto, which brings us to travel. Specifically, Italy during the European summer; our winter. As a coach, and before that, a player for North Melbourne between 1988 and 1999, it\u2019s something Longmire simply couldn\u2019t contemplate. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Europe in summer. Never been in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in football since I was 16, so for 38 years I\u2019ve never done that. I haven\u2019t organised anything; my daughter\u2019s still finishing year 12, so we\u2019re not doing it this year. But I want to go to Italy, I want to spend some time there. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to the most, to be honest.\u201d\n\nIt was in Europe, after last year\u2019s AFL grand final, when Longmire realised he was as cooked as the whole Bannockburn chicken we\u2019re about to rip into, along with some fries, gravy and cos lettuce. When Longmire signed a two-year contract extension in 2023, he agreed with chief executive Tom Harley that it would be his last. Having benefited from a seamless handover from Roos in 2011, he wanted to make sure Dean Cox, who was identified as his successor long ago, had the same luxury. The Bannockburn chicken with fries, cos lettuce and gravy. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer Midway through last year, the Swans were 12-1 and flying on top of the ladder. He was enjoying the ride, but felt something inside. \u201cI needed a rest,\u201d Longmire says. \u201cSpoke to Tom about it. We got to the end of the home and away season, and on the eve of the finals, we had another chat, went for a drive in the car, and we had another chat about it, and we thought at that particular point I could be able to get through the end of this year [2025].\u201d\n\nBut the grand final changed things. The Swans lost by 60 points to the Brisbane Lions; it was Longmire\u2019s fourth grand final defeat in five attempts, and the second in a row by a big margin. It was a disaster nobody saw coming. As agreed, Longmire wasn\u2019t due to return to the club until January, giving him the opportunity to recharge his batteries at the end of last year. His son, Tom, had not long turned 21 and was in Europe on holiday. Longmire went to meet him, and they spent three weeks together in Britain, took in Premier League games involving Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, and then watched the Wallabies beat England at Twickenham. The Swans come to terms with their demoralising grand final loss last year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe did some things, father and son, that I never had a lot of time to do,\u201d he says.\u201cWe went out for dinner one night, and I said, \u2018I think I\u2019m about done.\u2019 So yeah, that was an interesting moment.\u201d The day after Longmire landed home, he went to see Harley and Swans chairman Andrew Pridham, let them know, and they found him a new job upstairs. (We\u2019ll get onto that after the main course, which was delightful.)\n\nLongmire seems to have made peace with what happened against the Lions, and his unfortunate 1-4 record in grand finals, which grossly undersells what a transformative coach he has been for the Swans \u2013 if it\u2019s possible for someone so competitive to make peace with such things. \u201cYou probably bury it down inside you somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you sat there just thinking about it the whole time, you\u2019d end up just sad. You have to balance the whole thing out with \u2026 the fact the club\u2019s in great shape, we\u2019ve given our players and staff and supporters opportunities. It would have been great to make more of those opportunities. I guess some clubs will be sitting there looking at the fact that we\u2019ve been able to finish top four a number of times and get to grand finals \u2026 that\u2019s a high, high standard to be able to achieve. The club\u2019s still in a good position to have another crack and I think that\u2019s what we try and do, is give ourselves another crack at it.\u201d Speaking of another crack ... Tassie? Any chance? \u201cJesus, mate,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here on a Monday having a beer with you and having lunch and all of a sudden, you\u2019re throwing that at me.\u201d Sorry, but I had to ask. The Tasmania Devils are supposed to become the AFL\u2019s 19th team in a few years\u2019 time (assuming they can build a stadium) and pretty soon they\u2019ll be looking for a coach. Longmire seems like the perfect guy to build them a winning culture from the ground up. They\u2019ve reportedly already approached him to be the boss of their football department, and he told them no.\n\nIs he done with coaching? He can\u2019t say for sure. \u201cI only just stopped,\u201d he says, nursing his schooner of Hahn SuperDry. For me, Balter. Loading \u201cDon\u2019t read anything into that because there\u2019s nothing to be read into that from my perspective. I\u2019ve just stopped. I had a couple of months off over Christmas, and I\u2019m getting into a new part of my life as far as new business opportunities, so I\u2019m sort of looking to dive into that at the moment. All my energies are into that.\u201d Longmire allowed himself a couple of days to veg out on the couch, but a bloke like him doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that for too long. So it was on to the next thing. He still goes into the Swans\u2019 Moore Park offices five days a week, and has made himself available to Cox for advice whenever he needs it, though he no longer works in the football department. His new job title is executive director of club performance, allowing him to more deeply explore his many other interests. Longmire\u2019s breadth of experience in the AFL universe is vaster than some might realise; before he became a coach, he worked part-time at the AFL Players\u2019 Association, headed up IMG\u2019s nascent Aussie rules talent management division, and even worked as a television presenter on the Seven Network show Game Day. One of his clients at the time, Paul Salmon, was supposed to host it but pulled out, and left the producers in a pinch.\n\n\u201cThey said to me, \u2018Do you want to go in?\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe had no auto-cues, no training, no anything. Fair to say we were thrown in the deep end. Myself, Todd Viney and Tony Shaw. We spent all those Sundays in the studios \u2026 I was hosting three different time zones all over Australia, four different games. Trying to get my head around that was interesting.\u201c The bill Longmire\u2019s new baby is something called the Sydney Swans Institute (SSI), which offers a variety of leadership and development programs in which he and the club will share their philosophies on people, culture and performance and what they\u2019ve learned in their pursuit of sustained success. That\u2019s what Longmire delivered at the Swans; in his 14 seasons, they missed the finals only twice, defying an AFL system specifically designed to prevent dynasties. The idea for the \u201cinstitute\u201d has been sitting in the back of his mind for a few years, and was partly inspired by executive business and leadership courses he had attended at Harvard. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes. We\u2019ve had setbacks. We\u2019ve had success,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about sharing those ups and downs. You need something, a purpose to get out of bed in the morning. In my case, I was coaching for such a long time. Coaching was just enormous for that. Now I\u2019m putting my time into this, and it\u2019s been great.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Having an Oscar, says Cillian Murphy, hasn\u2019t really changed anything for him. Two weeks after the ceremony in 2024, where he was named best actor for his lead performance in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, he was back on a film set. The previous year, he says, he had done more publicity than he had done in the previous 28 years. \u201cI also did two films, which I rarely do.\u201d Now he was back working with good mates, taking the dog for long walks over the Kerry hills and being a dad to two teenagers: everything was normal. \u201cNothing is different. That\u2019s genuine. I\u2019m not just saying that.\u201d \u201cNothing is different\u201d: Cillian Murphy with his Best Actor Oscar for Oppenheimer. Credit: AP Before Oppenheimer, Murphy was probably most recognised as that bloke in Peaky Blinders, the BBC/Netflix gangster series set in 1920s Birmingham whose legions of fans love everything about it, from the theme song to the haircuts to the characters, not just the blue-eyed ringleader. Hard-core, Oscar-style stardom crept up on Murphy slowly, much to his retrospective relief. He says he couldn\u2019t have faced it when he was younger. Murphy grew up in Cork, a lively city in Ireland\u2019s south-west. Both his parents were teachers. In his teens, all he wanted to do was play in a band; even now, he will \u201cdo anything that involves music \u2026 even just making mix tapes or making radio shows\u201d, as he told the Financial Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a primal thing.\u201d Cillian Murphy and Elaine Cassidy in Disco Pigs. It was the same urge that led him to badger a local theatre director to give him an audition when he was supposed to be studying law. The director was persuaded. Murphy got a part and was away to the arts, never to look back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 19, he was cast in Disco Pigs, a vivid two-hander about a childhood friendship by Enda Walsh \u2013 another energetic Cork lad, just 10 years older than him \u2013 which toured the world and was then turned into a film in 2001. They are still best of friends; Walsh wrote the script for Small Things Like These, Murphy\u2019s latest film, based on Claire Keegan\u2019s Booker-shortlisted novel. Eileen Walsh, his stage partner in Disco Pigs all those years ago, plays his wife in this film. Cillian Murphy and Eileen Walsh in Small Things Like These. Credit: Enda Bowe/Lionsgate That\u2019s how Murphy likes to work \u2013 and one reason he has made six films with Christopher Nolan, including three Batmans and Oppenheimer. The new film is directed by Tim Mielants, a Belgian director who worked on Peaky Blinders. \u201cIf you trust somebody, you can really go straight to the work and be vulnerable and really try things out,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cI think a lot of my work has been re-collaborations.\u201d Small Things Like These, which he also produced, is indeed a small thing compared with Oppenheimer, but Murphy gives arguably his best performance ever as Bill Furlong, a coal merchant and decent family man who finds himself at loggerheads with the Catholic Church, source of all authority in the country town where he lives. It is set in 1985, years before the Celtic Tiger roared; people live somewhere between poverty and modest means, good Catholics all, much as they have for generations. It is a shock when music starts up in the pub and turns out to be the Human League\u2019s Don\u2019t You Want Me, an \u201980s hit. Otherwise, it might as well be 1955. Bill Furlong delivers coal to the nearby Magdalen laundry, run by the same nuns as the local convent where his five daughters are at school. Everyone knows each other\u2019s business round these parts, but you are advised to mind your own. When he finds a young girl locked in the laundry\u2019s coal cellar on a freezing winter\u2019s night, a well-meaning friend tells him to look to his own family: his girls need that convent education. But Bill can\u2019t just walk away. It was Yvonne McGuinness, Cillian Murphy\u2019s artist wife, who suggested he and Mielants bring Keegan\u2019s slender but potent story to the screen. They both jumped at it, but it didn\u2019t feel like an easy sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe kind of realised very quickly that it would have to be a very quiet film with an almost non-verbal performance from the main character for it to work, because the book is so interior,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cSo we knew it would have to be an unusual kind of film for today\u2019s cinematic landscape.\u201d Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, the role that earned him an Oscar. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo They had a lucky break, however. Talking to Matt Damon between scenes on the set of Oppenheimer, Murphy told him the story. \u201cHe really got it,\u201d Murphy told Deadline later. Artists Equity, Damon\u2019s production company with Ben Affleck, was soon on board. Murphy can remember something of the Ireland portrayed in Keegan\u2019s novel. \u201cI would have been nine in 1985 and I grew up in a city,\u201d he says. \u201cLuckily, I didn\u2019t directly experience any encounters with these institutions. But everything around me was run by the Church. I went to a Catholic primary school; at my secondary school I was taught by brothers. My dad trained to become a priest but then didn\u2019t become one. It was in every facet of my life, although never in a malevolent way. Cillian Murphy plays a man who defies the Catholic Church in Small Things Like These. Credit: Shane O\u2019Connor/Lionsgate \u201cBut I was aware there were two laundries in Cork, one very close to where I grew up. It was never talked about. It was only until the whole thing began to be revealed that I began to take notice of it. And then it was kind of this huge schism in Irish society when everything was blown open about the abuses in the Church, and it was kind of devastating for the whole country. It was very hard not to be deeply affected by it, if only as an observer.\u201d The story takes place just before Christmas, with its attendant festive drinks, puddings being baked at home and a rush for last-minute presents. Set against this is Bill\u2019s melancholy, fading into memories of his own childhood. He was born out of wedlock; his mother was taken as a housekeeper by a wealthy Protestant woman who treated Bill like a grandson, giving him books to read and opening up his world. He has never been told who his father is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he finds the shivering girl in the coal cellar \u2013 called Sarah, like his mother \u2013 he doesn\u2019t need to make a decision about what to do. His body drives him, moving of its own accord. A Catholic convent is the setting for unspeakable cruelty in Small Things Like These. Credit: Enda Bowe/Lionsgate \u201cI actually feel he\u2019s in the middle of some sort of nervous breakdown,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cAs happens with a lot of middle-aged men who are holding it together, holding it together, having to do that, not dealing with anything emotional \u2013 particularly at that point in Ireland \u2013 and then it comes like a tsunami and hits him. And he begins to piece together over the course of this Christmas what has formed him as a man \u2026 I never, ever considered him a hero and it would have been kind of limiting to play him like that. It was much more interesting to play him as a character who was just kind of driven by this terrible inner reckoning, you know.\u201d Loading Cases of abuse continue to be brought before the courts and national commissions in Ireland; it is essential work that the majority of people will never see or read; books and films ask questions in a gentler way. Of course, Murphy says, the most egregious abusers \u2013 generally priests \u2013 should be tracked down and arrested. \u201cBut otherwise, it\u2019s hard to apportion blame,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it was a whole society that seems to have been complicit in what was going on. I think it has to be about understanding, now, how it happened. How did we get to a place where everybody knew, but didn\u2019t know?\u201d Surely, I say, the convent\u2019s ruling Sister Mary \u2013 portrayed by Emily Watson in a rivetingly fiendish performance that won her the top acting award at the recent Berlin Film Festival \u2013 deserves punishment? She seems to have thrived on cruelty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut then, how could you not blame Eileen?\u201d counters Murphy. \u201cBecause she knows what\u2019s going on, that\u2019s very clear, but she doesn\u2019t call it out. I think it is about a spectrum from innocence to complicity. Where does one place oneself on that spectrum? It\u2019s very hard, even now, to talk about it.\u201d Murphy has a reputation as publicity-shy, but he says he enjoys discussing the work once it is done. Indeed, I get the sense he has several pints\u2019 worth of views on the issues raised by Small Things Like These. When he\u2019s working, however, he acts on instinct; while other actors talk about a process, he says he has no idea what\u2019s going on. \u201cIt\u2019s like doing anything intensively for 17 hours a day and then reading about it and thinking about it all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cInevitably, you begin to exchange atoms with the character at some point. But it\u2019s never conscious.\u201d Cillian Murphy in Peaky Blinders. I wonder what it must be like to exchange atoms with Tommy Shelby, the red right hand of Peaky Blinders. Murphy has played the ruthless gangster for six seasons, filmed over 12 years. A feature \u2013 \u201cone for the fans,\u201d he says \u2013 starring Barry Keoghan, Tim Roth and Rebecca Ferguson alongside Murphy, is expected to release in cinemas as well as on Netflix later this year. Murphy laughs. \u201cHe\u2019s exhausting to play,\u201d he says. \u201cThe nice thing about Peaky is that we would do a season, and then I\u2019d have a year or 18 months or two years off. And it\u2019s a gift of a character. He\u2019s relentless.\u201d And another victim of a rotten social system? \u201cOh well \u2026 certainly, I think he\u2019s a product of what happened to British soldiers in the First World War,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly deeply damaged. We always looked at the character like there was a line before 1914 and another line after 1918. We never get to see that earlier version of him, but I think he was forever changed by a different sort of system, where young men were sacrificed and those who survived were just spat back into society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Global markets had previously posted gains on hopes Trump might be willing to negotiate down the array of country and product-specific trade barriers he is erecting around the world's largest consumer market.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's sweeping tariffs have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Right now, we've received the instruction to prioritise our allies and our trading partners like Japan and Korea and others,\" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Fox News.\n\n\n\nThe White House said Trump instructed his trade team to create \"tailor-made\" deals for the nearly 70 countries that have reached out for talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's lead trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, told Congress his office is trying to work quickly but is not facing a particular deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The president has been clear, again, that he's not doing exemptions or exceptions in the near term,\" Greer told politicians.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina is bracing for a war of attrition, and manufacturers are warning about profits and scrambling to plan new overseas plants.\n\n\n\n\n\nChipmaker Micron told customers it will impose a tariff-related surcharge starting on Wednesday, while US clothing retailers said they are delaying orders and holding off on hiring.\n\n\n\nThree out of four Americans expect prices to rise as Donald Trump's tariffs kick in, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Source: AAP / John G. Mabanglo/EPA Running shoes made in Vietnam that now retail for $155 will cost $220 when Trump's 46 per cent tariff on that country takes effect, according to an industry group.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers are stocking up while they can. \"I'm buying double of whatever \u2014 beans, canned goods, flour, you name it,\" Thomas Jennings, 53, said as he pushed a shopping cart through the aisles of a New Jersey Walmart.\n\n\n\n\n\nStock markets found a firmer footing on Tuesday after a gut-wrenching few days for investors, which prompted some business leaders, including those close to Trump, to urge the president to reverse course.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean shares bounced off 14-month lows after four straight sessions of heavy selling, while global oil prices steadied after falling to four-year lows.\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street's main indexes had posted gains earlier in the day but fell after the White House said the tariffs on China would take effect.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fears of recession as US tariffs bite\n\nThe European Commission is mulling counter-tariffs of 25 per cent on a range of US goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials said they stand ready to negotiate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place and faces a 20 per cent tariff on other products on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nSamantha Floreani's e-mail is on her local member of parliament mailing list.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't added by signing up.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, it was added after she emailed her representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people have been persuaded to get in touch with their representatives about all kinds of issues that they care about. That's a normal part of Democratic participation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite attempting to unsubscribe multiple times, this has not worked.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike businesses or other organisations, your local member doesn't need to include an option to unsubscribe in their emails.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because of a political exception in the Spam Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar rule also exists in the laws that govern privacy and the Do Not Call Register.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exemption covers registered political parties, politicians and candidates, as well as contractors and volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of data by the major parties has provoked discussion, with the launch of partisan postal vote application sites, and physical mailouts leading to claims of data harvesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the political exemption, politicians are not subject to the same rules as everyone else.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost three-quarters of Australians incorrectly think that political parties are subject to the Privacy Act, according to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's most recent community survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n82 per cent of respondents believe they should be.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Floreani, who is also a digital rights advocate, agrees they should be, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPoliticians should be included in the rules that we expect the public and private sectors to abide by. I think it's unacceptable for politicians to lead and represent Australians when they don't they themselves adhere to the rules that they've made for the rest of us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there are significant risks of data breaches resulting from the collection of personal data in these political contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe should also consider that the more information that an organisation collects increases the risk or the potential consequence should there be a security breach. If there's a data breach, for example, if they are collecting and storing not just your, say your contact details, for example, but also things like your interest in particular political topics or your political beliefs, then that is extremely valuable and rich data that would be pretty devastating if it was to end up in the wrong hands.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tegan Cohen is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Queensland University of Technology, who has studied voter privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe lack of visibility about what exactly, what that data is something which makes the risk even harder to assess. But certainly it is very likely that political parties do hold quite a bit of sensitive information about us, about their constituents, about their prospective voters not knowing what that information is and the party's not having obligations, legislative obligations to make sure that data is secure is pretty troubling.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sensitive data can be used to target messages to small groups, or even individual voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Cohen says this takes political messaging out of the public sphere, making it harder to scrutinise its content.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there is a strong link between privacy and free and informed voting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don't have to look very far or very hard for examples of how invasions of privacy, surveillance, is used as a tool to suppress political dissent and chill political speech.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile vague privacy policies and repeated data breaches have contributed to privacy fatigue, Dr Cohen says there is hope for change in the potential introduction of a fair and reasonable test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that's really important because they can't contract out of that obligation. They can't get our consent to use or disclose data unfairly. And it sort of puts the onus on them to think about whether or not their uses are proportionate, if the benefits outweigh the risks, the harms that they might do, the sensitivity of the information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe test was recommended in the recent privacy review, but has been left to a second stage of reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Cohen says that there is a misunderstanding about what removing the exemption would do, based on an overestimation of the current scope and limits of the Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says applying the Privacy Act to political parties and candidates would lead to more open and transparent use of voter data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would make sure that when they collect it, they use it for the purpose that they originally collected it for or the purpose that's related, not purposes that are way outside the scope of our expectations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would also require them to protect the public's information from unauthorised use.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamantha Floreani says politicians could still use data to inform their communication with voters, while being subject to the Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter of saying that political parties shouldn't be able to collect any data or do any form of analytics to assist their campaign processes. It could be considered reasonable and fair for political parties to be using the personal information of voters for these purposes, but these practices should be subject to the limitations and the protections contained in the privacy Act to ensure that they are lawful and transparent and fair and reasonable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Cohen says we are holding elections in an entirely different technological environment to when the exemptions were introduced, as it is now much easier to collect data and target voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe exemptions were introduced in 2001, and at that time political parties did have voter databases, but a lot of messaging to voters was done through tv, through letter boxing. I think email might've been sort of on the up and coming, but it was certainly before we had the kind advent of large digital platforms.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the government first passed the Privacy Act at the end of 1988, it only applied to government agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust over ten years later, it was extended to include private organisations, and exclude political ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the Attorney-General said he was confident that it would not unduly limit the effective operation of the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the exemption was included to protect freedom of political communication, and to enhance the operation of the electoral and political process in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Privacy Commissioner did not agree that it was appropriate, saying political institutions should follow the same rules they ask others to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing no objection, I call Senator Stott-Despoja.\" \"Thank you Mr President and I move that the following bill be introduced. A bill for an act to amend the Privacy Act 1988 to remove the exemption provided by the Act for political acts and practices and for related purposes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSix years after the exemption came into force, Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja, from the Australian Democrats, introduced a private members bill to remove the exception.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer bill lapsed at the end of the parliamentary term in 2008, before being restored and later lapsing again.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended in 2007 and 2010 that the exemption should be removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same recommendation was made more recently by the Attorney-General's department in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department said almost all submissions supported narrowing or removing the exemption, with only two calling for it to remain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough advocacy work, Samantha Floreani has been involved in discussions for the recent review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt always ends up being pushed aside. It just hasn't gotten through and I have no confidence that it will, because it ultimately does serve their interests to be able to have a bit of a free for all with our personal information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite it's 24-year long persistence, Dr Cohen isn't convinced that the political exemption is necessary.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's incredibly soul destroying to see how rapidly the nation's environments are eroding and to see successive governments make really, really stupid policy decisions, and essentially, not connect the science to the policy and the science to the management.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor David Lindenmayer is a world-leading expert in biodiversity conservation, but he often feels like he's failed in his career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know, you dedicate 45 years of your life to making Australia a better place and improving the nation's environment, and we see these kinds of trends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity Council Director James Trezise says Australia is experiencing an extinction crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia leads the world in the loss of mammals. We're second overall when it comes to the loss of biodiversity. But what the researchers continually shown is that Australians care and love for nature, but they don't actually understand the scale of strife that it's in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biodiversity Council surveyed 3,500 people leading into this year's federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trezise says while cost of living is the top concern, voters care about other issues too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The environment came out fifth, but it wasn't a distant fifth. It came out just behind housing, healthcare, and the economy, which were at 54 per cent, housing and healthcare; 52 per cent for the economy; and 50 per cent for the environment. And so it is really in that kind of top tier of issues that Australians and voters are concerned about.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy policies have been a focus of both major parties in this campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut neither the government nor opposition have been focusing on the environment - despite concerns from campaign and industry groups that Australia's nature laws are not fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor went to the last election promising to fix these problems with its Nature Positive laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek outlining that plan last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody agrees that the current regulatory system does not work. We said that we will fix our laws so that they're less bureaucratic and provide more certainty for business, and so that they improve nature, protect our unique native plants and animals and prevent extinctions. That's what the community expects and that's what we are delivering.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the laws were shelved - never reaching a vote in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation's National Biodiversity Policy Director , Brendan Sydes says he's disappointing the government didn't deliver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government had started off fairly well back in December 2022, in releasing their Nature Positive plan and committing to a thorough overhaul of the legislation. That became complicated and people started to lose confidence in the exercise when there were delays, and then ultimately, when the government said, well, we're now only doing this, or part of it now, and what they were calling stage two, and we're going to come back to come back to it later on. So I think that's important context. Nonetheless, there are some important reforms that would have been a step forward in that package.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese included attempts to establish a compliance and enforcement body, to be known as Environment Protection Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stage Two laws also sought to establish Environment Information Australia, an independent data and information body.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Trezise argues there was a concerted effort to kill the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we actually saw at the end of the day was the West Australian Premier at the behest, really, of the West Australian mining lobby call up the Prime Minister and say kill this reform.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor puts the blame with the crossbench and Greens for the laws not passing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek told SBS that it was disappointing The Greens worked with the Liberals in the Senate to block the establishment of an independent EPA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens deny this - saying the Prime Minister ended negotiations even after they compromised on key demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not the first time there's been efforts to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, also known as the E-P-B-C.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor at the Australian National University Andrew Macintosh says the legislation requires governments to commission an independent statutory review every 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the first was the Hawke review, and then the second one was the Samuel review. The Hawke review was, it certainly pointed out limitations of legislation. It made a whole bunch of recommendations about additional triggers and improvements that needed to be made. A number of them were made. A whole bunch of them weren't made.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says by the second review in 2020, there were deeper concerns about the laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that's not a huge surprise. By that stage, everybody had got on the same page, that this legislation wasn't working and it needed major changes. In 2009, that wasn't the case, there was still some environment groups hanging onto the idea that this could still work, but by the time that Samuel was appointed and his reviewers underway it was pretty much a friendless piece of legislation. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key recommendation from that review was the establishment of national environment standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Macintosh says this would clarify when projects can and can't be approved.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Industry Group Director of Climate Change and Energy, Tennant Reed, says businesses would also welcome new standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There'd be just one process, and just one set of hoops to jump through, rather than the status quo where we do have two tracks of decision making, federal and state, which doubles at least the amount of work that needs to be done to get a project, considered and decided on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTennant Reed says the current approval processes is uncertain, and can take years to progress, standing in the way of important projects, including those that can help drive down emissions, like for offshore wind projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been back and forth between the project proponents, the state government and the federal government. And of course these are decisions that need to be made in a careful way, but we've got multiple governments trying to summon an energy industry around offshore wind into existence and tripping over each other in the process of navigating these environmental rules. We've got to be able to do better than that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommendations in the Samuel review are supported by the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Business Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some industry groups had concerns about the scope of a prospective environmental protection agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says the government would look at establishing the E-P-A under a different model\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we'll be doing is attempting to legislate an EPA. We have 25 votes out of 76. I'm yet to see a list published, including by The Guardian, that shows a majority, fifty percent plus one of the senate voting for any of the legislation that's put forward. That's just a fact. What what we did was take the recommendations from the Samuel review - importantly, that was a review, initiated by the Coalition, not by us - because the EPBC Act is out of date. We know that that is the case.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Tanya Plibersek did not directly respond to questions from S-B-S about how Labor would reform environment laws beyond attempting to establish an E-P-A.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, she points to increased protection for bushland and ocean, approvals for renewable energy, and investment in the Great Barrier Reef to defend Labor's environment record.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says it is agrees the EPBC Act is broken, and remains committed to fundamental reform in line with the Samuel review.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they say the Nature Positive laws threatened jobs, increased 'green tape', and extended the remit of the proposed E-P-A well beyond what had been recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor David Lindenmayer says the E-P-B-C Act has proved \"next to useless\" and the time for inaction has well and truly run out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An incoming government actually needs to do something about it. If we want to stop by diversity loss, then you have to connect the best science to the best practice and you have to invest properly to solve the biodiversity crisis problem in this country. And really, I think the only way to do that from everything that I've seen, is for the country to create an environmental levy. Just like we have a Medicare levy to deal with the health of the people in this country, we actually need an environmental levy to deal with the health of the environments in this country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he'd like to see such a levy set at one per cent of the federal budget.\n\n\n\n",

But it allows that project to get up and running, and it allows those 200 units to come onto the market.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sara Tomevska and Anna Henderson",

You are condemning young people like me to a lifetime of climate distasters. Of course we have poor mental health issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 21 year old protester, Alexa Stuart, speaking to media outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well today, Prime Minister Albanese was having a press conference saying how much he cares about young people. And yet, his government, since being elected, have approved 33 new coals and gas projects. And we know these approvals are fueling dangerous climate change that's going to have devastating impacts on the futures of me and all young people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she is feeling the mental toll of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have experienced eco anxiety since I have been 15. I am worried that that my future will be full of increased floods, fire, famines, and drought.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's promise including establishing 21 new Medicare Mental Health Centres and upgrade 10 centres across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler conceding that more work is needed to address long term mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think about 230,000 adults with severe and chronic mental illness are currently not getting support from the NDIS or some other funding scheme from state governments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package includes a significant investment in the workforce - creating 1,200 training places for mental health professionals and peer workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychiatrist, and President Elect for College of Psychiatrists Australia and New Zealand Dr Astha Tomar says its desperately needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At least 10 years of under investment in mental health as a system, also in our workforce, is the reason we are, at this pointy end where it is largely a crumbling health system. You know, whether we're talking about the private mental health system or public mental health system, none of them are working.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it will take a while to build up the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Workforce, we have to remember, does not happen overnight. It's almost 10 to 12 years of investment by a government, but also a commitment a person makes in becoming a specialist in psychiatry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young welcoming Labor's plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a good move. We need more support for people, particularly for young people, who are struggling with getting the help they need. We now call on the government to match us on dental, and getting dental into Medicare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Butler says the focus is on Medicare's existing remit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the moment, we don't have any short term ability to make a fundamental reform that would be very significant, very costly, because we're so focused on rebuilding general practice, in particular, after 10 years of cuts and neglect. Our party, though, does have ambition. It's in our party platform over time, but it's not going to be over the over the short term.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition has previously announced almost $1 billion towards mental health, including $400 million towards youth mental health, and permanently doubling the number of Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions people can access a year to 20.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous coalition government increased the available sessions from 10 to 20 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which Labor since reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton says investment in the system is positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's roughly about the same investment at this election from both parties into mental health and i think that's a great think. think it is good if we can try and increase the workforce. I think it is good if we can try and provide support to to clinicians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition Leader positioning himself as the better economic manager, as billions are wiped off the stock market as a response to Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This election is about who has a better plan to manage our economy in very difficult and uncertain times, who has the ability to keep our country safe in a very uncertain period in history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Treasury spokesman Angus Taylor says global issues are being felt in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen a crash in our capital markets, in the value of many Australians assets, their superannuation and other investments that they've made. Over the last week or so, we've seen very significant reductions in those portfolios. And of course, that means Australians are poorer than they were just a week ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has removed a Liberal Party candidate for the New South Wales seat of Whitlam after he expressed controversial views, including that women should not serve in combat roles within the Australian Defence Force.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton says there were other issues too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, there were a number of issues, not just those that have been made public in relation to the candidate and to the decision to replace Bennett's candidate. That's the decision to take an issue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions have been raised about the stance of opposition Defence spokesperson Andrew Hastie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former soldier told Sky News in 2018 that his personal view is that the fighting DNA of a close combat unit is best preserved when it is exclusively male.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton says Mr Hastie's views have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Andrew Hastie\u2019s view is the same as mine. And that's the position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it's changed if it is.\"\n\n\n\n",

Recruitment and retention has been a challenge for the Australian Defence Force. We need to be making sure that the defence force is growing. We are budgeting for significant growth in the defence force over the next 15 years and it's really important that we're attracting people to the defence force and in critical areas such as those that are the focus of today's wage increase.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea's government has called a snap election for June 3rd after former president Yoon Suk Yeol was removed from office over his short-lived declaration of martial law.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court for violating his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on December 3rd and mobilising troops in an attempt to halt parliamentary proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cabinet has now agreed on the June 3rd date after discussions with the National Election Commission since it needed to approve a public holiday for the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nActing Minister of South Korea\u2019s Interior and Safety Ministry, Ko Ki-dong, says the government will ensure a fair transition of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an election to select the next president within a short period of 60 days.

        "text": "As stock markets across the globe continue to tumble amid Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, concerns about a recession in Australia have reignited.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, share markets around the world experienced their biggest declines since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. Major indexes on New York's Wall Street dropped about 10 per cent, and the tech-focused Nasdaq is down 20 per cent from its recent high. Markets in Europe and Asia have also fallen.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the main S&P/ASX 200 index fell another 4.2 per cent on Monday after falls last week, dropping to its lowest point since December 2023, before rallying on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a press conference in Sydney on Tuesday, Opposition leader Peter Dutton warned Australians that a recession was \"coming for our economy\" under the Labor government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government hasn\u2019t prepared our economy. Labor has made decisions in subsequent budgets now which make it harder for the economy to function with international headwinds,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How can trillions just disappear? What you may not know about the stock market\n\nBut Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia was better placed than other countries to deal with the economic fallout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are global headwinds that we are seeing. We have to deal with that,\" he said on Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not immune from impacts of the global economy, but what we have shown consistently is a preparedness to act for the times, to provide support that is needed for people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth leaders were asked if they could guarantee a recession would not happen under their watch, but neither ruled out the possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while a falling share market may be worrying everyday Australians, experts say we shouldn't panic about what lies ahead. Here's why.\n\n\n\nShould Australians be worried about a recession?\n\nWith markets swinging, talk of a recession is gaining momentum. But should everyday Australians be worried?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially, they should be concerned but not alarmed,\" said Dr Luke Hartigan, lecturer at the University of Sydney and a former Reserve Bank economist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The direct effect of the tariffs on Australia is going to be relatively small. The US is only one of our smaller trading partners.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Fears of recession as US tariffs bite SBS News 08/04/2025 06:51 Play\n\nThe bigger risk, he explained, is how Australia's major trade partners \u2014 especially China \u2014 respond to newly imposed tariffs by the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If those economies go into recession, that could have an impact on us via our trade linkages, specifically iron ore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP.\n\n\n\nBut Hartigan says that doesn't always tell the full story, especially here in Australia. He says that because trade is such a large part of our economy, there can be domestic weakness that doesn't show up in GDP. Instead, he says the labour market is a better signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The labour market is still very tight in Australia. We've got a four in front of our labour unemployment rate \u2014 that's very low.\" According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia's unemployment rate in February was 4.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver also does not expect Australia to enter a recession but predicts a slower pick-up in growth than forecast by Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That obviously does run the risk that we could end up with higher unemployment here, back to the 4.5 per cent rate for unemployment,\" he told Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\nStock markets around the globe have plummeted in reaction to Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Source: SBS News\n\nWhat about the stock market crash?\n\nAustralians may be worried after the plummets in the stock market this week, which wiped billions from portfolios and super balances. But Hartigan urges perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The stock market isn\u2019t the economy \u2014 it\u2019s a barometer of where investors think the economy is heading. And it\u2019s not always accurate,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's an old saying from one famous economist, Paul Samuelson, who said the stock market picked nine of the last six recessions in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It tends to overreact. Sometimes it's right, but many times it's not. And it could be the case that it's overreacting a little bit now.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia uniquely positioned to tackle economic uncertainty\n\nHartigan says there are a few tools Australia has under its belt that can help ward off a recession, should the worst happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first is in our dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a very unique feature of our economy,\" Hartigan said. \"The Australian dollar is very flexible and it's likely to collapse \u2014 and that will provide a very good cushion to the Australian economy.\"\n\n\n\nHe says the falling dollar acts as a \"shock absorber\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It supports our incomes, makes our exports relatively more competitive \u2026 the 10 per cent tariff that has been imposed on our exports is basically nothing because our dollar has dropped nearly 10 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second is in the Reserve Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA can reduce interest rates. It has the flexibility to do that. Markets are expecting a cut next in May and potentially more cuts during the year ... so that will provide a cushion to consumers and to businesses.\"\n\n\n\n'Concerned, but not alarmed'\n\nWhen looking at the full picture, Hartigan says Australians should be \"concerned, but not alarmed\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm quite comfortable in saying that I think we should be okay. It may be a bit uncertain and we may see a lot more volatility on financial markets, but the real economy \u2014 people's incomes \u2014 should be okay, at least for now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been talk of a recession in Australia for a number of years and it hasn't transpired. A recession is very serious, they can happen. But based on how things are now, I don't think that's going to happen.\"\n\n\n\n",

They often get more unwell, and end up having to be cared of in a more expensive part of the system. And in the meantime, they are not able to participate in work and be a productive member of society in a way they so deeply want to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition leader did not confirm whether he'd match the Prime Minister's $1 billion investment in mental health, saying Labor were rebranding Coalition policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of doctors across more than 30 public hospitals in New South Wales are striking for three days - the first time in more than 25 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe health care professionals want better pay and better work conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park insisted the strike's impacts would be far-reaching, with surgeries cancelled and a reduced staff on shift.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals Senator Bridget McKenzie says Australians need leaders with strong economic credentials, amid fears of a global recession resulting from US tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian shares suffered their biggest one-day fall since COVID-19 on Monday with nearly $110 billion in value being wiped off the ASX 200.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator McKenzie told Channel Nine Australians are worried about their superannuation and share portfolios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is a problem because Australians rightfully need someone with strong economic management credentials at the Treasury benches, and unfortunately the last 3 years have seen us in a weaker position. And that is not good news, given the global volatility.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump says he had a positive discussion with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Iran and trade tariffs, as he welcomed Mr Netanyahu to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump says the US will be holding direct talks with Iran starting Saturday, as he insists the country can't get nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it is getting to be very dangerous territory.

And I said, if that tariff isn't removed by tomorrow at 12:00, we're putting a 50% tariff on above the tariffs that we put on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his top advisers signalling a potential for negotiations, Donald Trump has ruled out discussions with Beijing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Trump administration does impose the additional tariffs, US tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists warn the move could not only increase costs for American consumers, but also incentivise China to flood other markets with cheaper goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Chan is the President of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce in California.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says small businesses are going to suffer as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many small businesses, they are suffering the most. And since, you know, the cost of doing business is much much higher. So even though people may be paying more, however, these businesses, they are not making more money at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith global financial markets falling steadily since the announcement last week [[02/04]], market volatility shows investors are still hoping for tariff negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the President says he will only be open to negotiations if he feels the deal is fair and beneficial to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuring the public that the initial financial pains will pay off in the long term, Mr Trump anticipates the tariffs will lead to more manufacturing jobs in the U-S.\n\n\n\n\n\nBankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride says sooner or later, prices are going to increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The widespread expectation is that we are going to see higher prices and in some cases you're probably starting to see that already for things like perishable goods where that inventory comes in much quicker than, say, bigger ticket items, where car dealers, for example, a lot of them stocked up on imports and months passed. So they've got a good supply on the lot now. The cars that will be subject to tariffs haven't yet entered the country, but at the end of the day, there's really not going to be a whole lot of places to hide because so many things that we buy are either imported or have components that are imported, and tariffs impact the pricing of all of that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump's threats to China came during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has imposed a 17 per cent tariff on Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to secure concessions from Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu says Israel will take its own tariffs against the U-S to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c I can tell you that I said to the president a very simple thing. We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States. We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. And we're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily. And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same. I recognize the, the position of the United States. It says, you know, we allow other countries to put tariffs on us, but we don't put tariffs on them. And, you know, I'm a free trade champion, and free trade has to be fair trade.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if he would consider sparing Israel, Mr Trump told reporters that the U-S already gives Israel a lot of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maybe not, maybe not. Don't forget, we help Israel a lot. You know we give Israel $4 billion a year. That's a lot, congratulations by the way, that's pretty good. But we give Israel, billions of dollars a year, billions. It's one of the highest of ... and we give a lot of we have a lot of countries money. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing few signs of backing down, White House trade advisor Pete Navarro says countries will need to do more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump says a European Union proposal for bilateral tariff exemptions on cars and industrial products is not enough to make up for the transatlantic trade deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic says it may take time to reach an agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for cars and all industrial goods. Second, let's be clear however, engaging the US will take both time and effort. Right now, we are in the early stages of discussions because the US views tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure. We are fully prepared to sit at the negotiation table whenever our American partners are ready.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the President and White House officials defend the sweeping tariffs, investors and economists say the risk of recession is growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Cipolloni is a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Mr Trump's tariff policies could lead the global economy down a familiar and unfavourable path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whenever we've had a crisis, be it COVID, be it the great financial crisis, be it 9/11, even, we've always had the government as the safety net for the markets. And that's gone today because the government is the cause of this crisis, which makes it so unique and so unusual. And so, we don't want to go back to 1930 corollaries, we don't want to go back to that path. I mean, that path was devastating. But there are a lot of commonalities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As Professor McGorry has said, demand for mental health support is continuing to increase. We're establishing new models of care that will start on the 1st of January next year, that we funded in a previous budget, the National Early Intervention Service for people who have relatively mild to moderate needs, but need a very quick early intervention to stop that spiralling into something more serious.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister Butler added that a Labor government did not currently have capacity to add free dental to Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition leader did not confirm whether he'd match the Prime Minister's $1 billion investment in mental health, saying Labor were rebranding Coalition policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government's funding includes $225 million to deliver 21 new Medicare Mental Health centres, and hundreds of millions of dollars towards youth mental health services and training for mental health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes as the Coalition government announced $400 million for the expansion of Headspace and mental health services at the end of last month, and promised to restore the number of sessions young people can receive from 10 to 20.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton told ABC Breakfast mental health is an issue the Coalition has taken very seriously, saying clinicians have asked for more services to deal with complex matters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of New South Wales doctors have begun a strike from today with many gathering outside a major hospital in western Sydney to protest pay and working conditions in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe union which announced the strike last week is pushing for a 30 per cent pay rise in one year, and 3 per cent in the years following, to bring rates in-line with other states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has countered with a 10.5 per cent increase over three years and an offer of 3 per cent now to be backdated if the strike is cancelled.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Mark Priestley is a senior medical officer at Westmead hospital and the state councillor for the Australian Salaried Medical Officers' Federation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the government has not done enough in the past year to to bring New South Wales in-line with other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want parity with other states so that our junior doctors don't leave to go elsewhere, and we want simple conditions within the award so that an obstetrician who comes to deliver a baby can get paid for coming in after hours. We want simple things that any man in the street, any patient would expect and exists in other states.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Priestley warned New South Wales could see a mass shortage of doctors as has occurred in the psychiatry sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government is working in a considered, organised way to manage the fallout from the United States' global tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian shares suffered their biggest one-day fall since COVID-19 on Monday with nearly $110 billion in value being wiped off the ASX 200, sparking fears for superannuation and share portfolios.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says despite living in uncertain times, his government was the first to respond to the tariffs decision, adding they will continue to engage constructively with the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision of the US administration, as I said last Thursday, is an act of self-harm, but it's also because it's the world's largest economy. It has implications for the global economy. What we are doing is preparing for that, but we are dealing with this in a considered organised way because that is what a considered government does.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes as the Opposition leader criticised the government for their response to the tariffs, telling ABC Breakfast that he would have been able to secure a better deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump has reiterated his desire for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip, in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump proposed this idea multiple times during the first weeks of his administration and has been globally condemned as a plan for ethnic cleansing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of his plan includes moving Palestinians around to different countries, which is something Mr Netanyahu also supported.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump once again referred to Gaza as an important piece of real estate, adding that Gaza could be turned into a freedom zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think that it's something that we would be involved in. But, you, know, having a peace force like the United States there controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing. Because right now, all it is is for years and years, all I hear about is killing and Hamas and problems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA fragile ceasefire in Gaza was shattered in March, after Israel launched attacks on Gaza in which they say they were targeting Hamas militants.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in cricket,\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer batting prodigy Will Pucovski has officially retired from cricket, admitting he is still suffering symptoms from repeated concussions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian last played Sheffield Shield in March 2024, when he was hit on the helmet by a delivery from Tasmania speedster Riley Meredith.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the 13th known concussion of his sporting career.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size \u201cSometimes I get there, and my hands just shake\u201d. If there is a quote that better captures the charming terror of the 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Course \u2013 home of the US Masters \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been uttered yet. The man who delivered the line is none other Jack Nicklaus, who is arguably the greatest golfer to ever play the game. The \u201cGolden Bear\u201d won 117 tournaments in his career, including a record 18 majors. Heck, Nicklaus won a peerless six Masters titles - and even he is scared of the 12th stop on a course he tamed more often than anyone else in history. So why does a postcard pretty par-three in the far corner of golf\u2019s most famous course, sitting on the edge of Raes Creek and framed by pink azaleas and dogwood trees, elicit such fear, even for Nicklaus? It\u2019s not just that Nicklaus could have had a Green Jacket for every day of the week had he not double-bogeyed no.12 in 1981.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the fact that Nicklaus is only one famous name on a very long list of star golfers, spanning 88 years, who also had their chances of victory blown up by a disastrous visit to the shortest hole of Augusta National. It is such a long list that the best option is to just start with the legends and infer the rest: luminaries like Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Gene Sarazen, Payne Stewart, Gary Player and even Tiger Woods. More recently Jordan Spieth\u2019s entire tournament imploded at no.12, and Rory McIroy and Cam Smith have sunk there too. And as the US Masters unfolds this week, the safest bet you can make is the hole will claim more victims - and probably the chances of a leading contender on Sunday, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest hole in tournament golf,\u201d Nicklaus said. Amen Corner The curious part about the murderous nature of the 12th is how innocent it appears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom tee to the front of the green is a casual 130 metres, and while that was a longer iron shot in Nicklaus\u2019 day, modern players can usually hit a green from that distance with a laser-guided wedge. So far, so good. But the hole is as treacherous as it is beautiful. It is golf\u2019s Mata Hari. The 12th hole is cut by Raes Creek, and to safely land on the green, players have to carry the water and a bunker sitting at the front edge. Cameron Smith tees off towards the 12th green at Augusta National in 2022. Credit: AP The next layer of difficulty is the size and shape of the green, designed in 1934 by Bobby Jones and Alistair MacKenzie (the latter a famed course designer who also built Royal Melbourne). The green is not only angled away from the tee, it is particularly narrow - about 10 metres in width - and getting a ball to stop on it requires a perfectly chosen club, and a perfectly struck shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHitting too long is bad news, as well, with thick shrubbery and downhill slopes out the back. But even if you hit your tee shot crisply, the third layer of difficulty is the unpredictability of the wind at the southern pocket of the course, which was dubbed \u201cAmen Corner\u201d in the 1950s by sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind. In a sport of mathematical precision and certainty, this is a corner where prayer is also embraced because the wind is often impossible to account for. Pros say the wind gusts and spirals in devilish ways, particularly above the tree line.

Credit: AP \u201cThey did studies on it and it\u2019s called the \u2018eddy effect\u2019,\u201d Bubba Watson said in 2020. \u201cIf you get a gust, it actually doubles the speed but you just don\u2019t know it. That\u2019s why you see some balls come up short and you\u2019re like \u2018Did that guy really just misclub by two clubs?\u2019.\u201d After putting a ball in the drink in the last round of 2019, Brooks Koepka said: \u201cOnce it gets above those trees, it\u2019s a guessing game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal knowledge helps, and there are umpteen tips and caddy\u2019s tales about how to gauge the wind. Many of the old legends waited until the flags on the 11th green, to the left of the 12th tee, blew downwind before they hit. Others waited until the tops of the trees to the right of the 12th green swayed a certain way. But prayer is as good a strategy as any. In 2013, Watson returned as the defending champion and hit a 10 at the 12th. And the hole is easier for left-handers. Ky Laffoon plays a shot at the edge of Raes Creek in the 1930s. Credit: Augusta National/Getty Images If you land in the water, the fourth layer of hell is the drop zone is back up the fairway, requiring an awkward lofted chip that still needs to clear water and stop on a dime. But you dare not spin the ball too much, because once a ball starts rolling down the 1.2 metre slope to the creek, you\u2019re cooked - again. \u201cThe very simple answer as to why it is so hard is that there is no good miss, there is no bail out,\u201d said former Open champion, turned leading golf commentator, Ian Baker-Finch. \u201cYou have to have the correct club. Most holes, most greens, most par threes offer an option. When the green is so narrow - from memory it is 14 paces from the front to the back, in the centre of the green - you just have to have the right club. You can\u2019t get away with not having the right club. \u201cSo there is a lot of pressure. Then you have to decide on the direction of the wind, and even on a calm day there is always something going on down there in the bottom corner\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Investors have been holding their hands to their throats for months as the spectacle of a once cocky casino company lurching towards its demise played out before them. The Star Entertainment Group\u2019s chief executive Steve McCann had flogged assets, sold out of Brisbane, squeezed the government for regulatory mercy and nearly secured a long-term funding deal, only to come up short. But as the company trickled down to its final dollar of cash, the former professional poker player had one more card in his hand. US casino giant Bally\u2019s Corporation, a self-described \u201cbuyer of last resort\u201d whose advances Star had previously rebuffed, now offered $300 million in funding in exchange for control of the company. This time, McCann signed. Introducing mandatory carded play in October was the final, fatal blow to Star\u2019s casino in Sydney. Credit: Louise Kennerley The rescue deal will come as a relief to Star\u2019s 9000 employees and the NSW government, which company insiders privately blame for its travails. Among Star\u2019s many injuries, the NSW government order for its Sydney casino to stop accepting cash from October last year threatened to be the fatal blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new cashless gambling regime required the casino to conduct extensive \u201cknow your customer\u201d checks on its patrons, and revenue dropped immediately and sharply after it was introduced. Too many of Star\u2019s customers did not wish to be known. Less than 400 metres down the road from the Sydney casino, Pyrmont Bridge Hotel has 19 poker machines where customers can play anonymously. It jumped 100 places up the state rankings by gaming machine net profit in the quarter after the changes at Star took effect. It is a dizzying turn of events for a company that less than four years ago was openly floating a $12 billion takeover of its weakened rival, Crown Resorts. When Star shares went into a trading halt this year, plenty of pundits envisaged a scenario where Crown bought the jewel in Star\u2019s portfolio \u2013 the Sydney casino \u2013 and with it the poker machine licences that would reverse its own fortunes. It will now be up to Bally\u2019s to return Star to profitability in a regulatory environment where it continues to be the only poker machine operator in Sydney that is not allowed to accept cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NSW Independent Casino Commission chief commissioner Philip Crawford said on Tuesday he had begun a probity assessment of Bally\u2019s Corporation and was continuing to work with Star on remediation. Ben Lee, managing partner of IGamiX Management and Consulting, said the NSW government\u2019s lopsided approach to gambling regulation suggested cashless gaming was being used as a punishment rather than a wholesale attempt to prevent money laundering. \u201cI think a lot of people were naive about the intention of the NSW authorities,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realise the depth of antipathy that the NSW government had for Star, and it\u2019s come to this point where Star and its representatives and even suitors like Bally\u2019s have no clear indication as to what the path is to recovery.\u201d Back in 2015, when Echo Entertainment rebranded itself to become The Star Entertainment Group, the company had a thriving market in Asian high rollers and the confidence to submit a $2.6 billion three-way bid to develop the Queens Wharf precinct that would be central to the Queensland government\u2019s revitalisation of the Brisbane CBD and accommodation of the 2032 Olympic Games. The arrival of Crown, with a tower in Barangaroo, added to the Star casino\u2019s woes. Credit: Wolter Peeters Two years earlier, the company had come off second best in a bruising contest with Crown, whose chairman, James Packer, had won government approval to operate a competing casino in NSW and was developing a luxury hotel at Barangaroo. But Star had leveraged this to its benefit by securing government funding to develop its own resort-style entertainment complex in Pyrmont. It was on the ascent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe business model developed by Crown and mimicked by Star was the cultivation of Chinese high rollers who were moving their private capital offshore on gambling tour groups known as junkets. In February 2018, Star\u2019s market capitalisation reached a high-water mark of $5 billion. Such was Star\u2019s chutzpah that it continued to aggressively pursue the VIP market even after The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed in 2019 that one of its major partners, the junket operator Suncity, was linked to organised crime. It did not pivot its business then, or in 2020 when the Bergin inquiry into Crown Resorts that resulted from those media reports uncovered breaches of anti-money laundering requirements so flagrant that Crown was deemed unfit to operate a Sydney casino. Instead, as the Bell inquiry was later to learn, Star became good at covering its tracks. It removed Suncity\u2019s branding from its private gaming salon, where bags of cash persisted and which continued to be operated for the junket operator\u2019s exclusive use. It disregarded independent audits of its money laundering systems, misled banks and helped Chinese high rollers to disguise their gambling expenses. Only when Star, too, was exposed by the media in 2021, and Adam Bell, SC, made his damning findings, did Star cease its association with some of the organised criminals, tax cheats and corporate fraudsters who were using its premises to clean their dirty cash. By this time, the high-roller market had dried up in the aftermath of COVID-19 and amid a crackdown by Chinese authorities. But the NSW government announced sweeping new regulations to be imposed on the company, including mandatory carded play, extensive due diligence on patrons, and $1000 cash limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen casino regulator fined the enfeebled company $100 million. The Star casino and Queens Wharf complex in Brisbane. Credit: Glenn Campbell Star\u2019s luck had turned. The cost of the Queens Wharf development had blown out by $1 billion, and one of Star\u2019s partners in that project, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, was facing probity questions. Star\u2019s saving grace was the willingness of the Queensland government, which was counting on the taxes to be generated by the casino, to dismiss concerns that Chow Tai Fook had misled regulators over its links to underworld figures as a misunderstanding. However, the alleged links between Chow Tai Fook and organised crime ruled it out of rescuing Star in NSW, where any ownership stake greater than 10 per cent would trigger probity checks. Loading The NSW Independent Casino Commission then ordered a second inquiry into Star last year, resulting in a $15 million fine for compliance breaches. Star successfully argued for the cash limit to stay at $5000 for 12 more months and for cardless play to be delayed from August until October 2024. But the change when it finally arrived was immediate.\n\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to the most, to be honest.\u201d\n\nIt was in Europe, after last year\u2019s AFL grand final, when Longmire realised he was as cooked as the whole Bannockburn chicken we\u2019re about to rip into, along with some fries, gravy and cos lettuce. When Longmire signed a two-year contract extension in 2023, he agreed with chief executive Tom Harley that it would be his last. Having benefited from a seamless handover from Roos in 2011, he wanted to make sure Dean Cox, who was identified as his successor long ago, had the same luxury.

He was enjoying the ride, but felt something inside. \u201cI needed a rest,\u201d Longmire says. \u201cSpoke to Tom about it. We got to the end of the home and away season, and on the eve of the finals, we had another chat, went for a drive in the car, and we had another chat about it, and we thought at that particular point I could be able to get through the end of this year [2025].\u201d\n\nBut the grand final changed things. The Swans lost by 60 points to the Brisbane Lions; it was Longmire\u2019s fourth grand final defeat in five attempts, and the second in a row by a big margin. It was a disaster nobody saw coming. As agreed, Longmire wasn\u2019t due to return to the club until January, giving him the opportunity to recharge his batteries at the end of last year. His son, Tom, had not long turned 21 and was in Europe on holiday. Longmire went to meet him, and they spent three weeks together in Britain, took in Premier League games involving Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, and then watched the Wallabies beat England at Twickenham. The Swans come to terms with their demoralising grand final loss last year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe did some things, father and son, that I never had a lot of time to do,\u201d he says.\u201cWe went out for dinner one night, and I said, \u2018I think I\u2019m about done.\u2019 So yeah, that was an interesting moment.\u201d The day after Longmire landed home, he went to see Harley and Swans chairman Andrew Pridham, let them know, and they found him a new job upstairs. (We\u2019ll get onto that after the main course, which was delightful.)\n\nLongmire seems to have made peace with what happened against the Lions, and his unfortunate 1-4 record in grand finals, which grossly undersells what a transformative coach he has been for the Swans \u2013 if it\u2019s possible for someone so competitive to make peace with such things. \u201cYou probably bury it down inside you somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you sat there just thinking about it the whole time, you\u2019d end up just sad. You have to balance the whole thing out with \u2026 the fact the club\u2019s in great shape, we\u2019ve given our players and staff and supporters opportunities. It would have been great to make more of those opportunities. I guess some clubs will be sitting there looking at the fact that we\u2019ve been able to finish top four a number of times and get to grand finals \u2026 that\u2019s a high, high standard to be able to achieve. The club\u2019s still in a good position to have another crack and I think that\u2019s what we try and do, is give ourselves another crack at it.\u201d Speaking of another crack ... Tassie? Any chance? \u201cJesus, mate,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here on a Monday having a beer with you and having lunch and all of a sudden, you\u2019re throwing that at me.\u201d Sorry, but I had to ask. The Tasmania Devils are supposed to become the AFL\u2019s 19th team in a few years\u2019 time (assuming they can build a stadium) and pretty soon they\u2019ll be looking for a coach. Longmire seems like the perfect guy to build them a winning culture from the ground up. They\u2019ve reportedly already approached him to be the boss of their football department, and he told them no.\n\nIs he done with coaching? He can\u2019t say for sure. \u201cI only just stopped,\u201d he says, nursing his schooner of Hahn SuperDry. For me, Balter. Loading \u201cDon\u2019t read anything into that because there\u2019s nothing to be read into that from my perspective. I\u2019ve just stopped. I had a couple of months off over Christmas, and I\u2019m getting into a new part of my life as far as new business opportunities, so I\u2019m sort of looking to dive into that at the moment. All my energies are into that.\u201d Longmire allowed himself a couple of days to veg out on the couch, but a bloke like him doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that for too long. So it was on to the next thing. He still goes into the Swans\u2019 Moore Park offices five days a week, and has made himself available to Cox for advice whenever he needs it, though he no longer works in the football department. His new job title is executive director of club performance, allowing him to more deeply explore his many other interests. Longmire\u2019s breadth of experience in the AFL universe is vaster than some might realise; before he became a coach, he worked part-time at the AFL Players\u2019 Association, headed up IMG\u2019s nascent Aussie rules talent management division, and even worked as a television presenter on the Seven Network show Game Day. One of his clients at the time, Paul Salmon, was supposed to host it but pulled out, and left the producers in a pinch.\n\n\u201cThey said to me, \u2018Do you want to go in?\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe had no auto-cues, no training, no anything. Fair to say we were thrown in the deep end. Myself, Todd Viney and Tony Shaw. We spent all those Sundays in the studios \u2026 I was hosting three different time zones all over Australia, four different games. Trying to get my head around that was interesting.\u201c The bill Longmire\u2019s new baby is something called the Sydney Swans Institute (SSI), which offers a variety of leadership and development programs in which he and the club will share their philosophies on people, culture and performance and what they\u2019ve learned in their pursuit of sustained success. That\u2019s what Longmire delivered at the Swans; in his 14 seasons, they missed the finals only twice, defying an AFL system specifically designed to prevent dynasties. The idea for the \u201cinstitute\u201d has been sitting in the back of his mind for a few years, and was partly inspired by executive business and leadership courses he had attended at Harvard. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes. We\u2019ve had setbacks. We\u2019ve had success,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about sharing those ups and downs. You need something, a purpose to get out of bed in the morning. In my case, I was coaching for such a long time. Coaching was just enormous for that. Now I\u2019m putting my time into this, and it\u2019s been great.\u201d",

        "text": "AI-enabled cameras are increasingly being adopted across Australia, with different states leveraging the technology in unique ways.\n\nNew AI-powered road cameras can detect when traffic is becoming congested, triggering green lights to improve flow. Source: SA government\n\nNew footage has revealed the impressive impact of AI-powered road cameras in the country's south, with authorities boasting the \"smart\" technology is already making roads safer by adjusting traffic lights in real time to keep cars flowing.\n\nThe South Australian government announced over the weekend a fresh batch of AI cameras will soon be rolled out in known congestion hotspots, in a bid to prevent long queues and reduce rear-end collisions by \"adjusting traffic signals in real time\".\n\nThis, the government says, creates safe gaps for cars to exit without vehicles being backed up, saving drivers \"time and stress\".\n\nFootage of AI cameras previously rolled out in the state last year shows how they're able to detect when traffic is becoming congested, triggering green lights to keep traffic moving.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne camera will go on the highway at the northern suburb of Penfield, and another will be placed at the major bus station, Paradise Interchange, in the northeast suburbs. Another two will go on the highway at the far-southern suburb of Old Noarlunga.\n\nThe SA government believes every 5,000 motorists stuck in traffic for 20 minutes costs the state economy $33,000. The new trial of four new cameras will cost $350,000.\n\nWhere are AI-powered road cameras used in Australia?\n\nAI-enabled cameras are increasingly being adopted across Australia, with different states leveraging the technology in unique ways to improve road safety, infrastructure management, and environmental protection.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn NSW, councils are using AI-integrated dashcams to automatically detect road defects such as potholes, damaged signage and worn line markings. This streamlines repair work and allows councils to respond to hazards more efficiently. Meanwhile, in Sydney\u2019s southwest, AI cameras are being trialled to detect koalas near roads, in hopes of alerting drivers in real time to prevent wildlife collisions.\n\nTransport for NSW has also rolled out world-first technology, installing a number of machine learning traffic counting and classifying cameras to analyse freight vehicles to help in assisting supply chain decisions that reduce congestion and lead to enhanced productivity.\n\nThe AI cameras are also able to detect the speed at which drivers are moving. Source: SA government\n\nIn Victoria, AI is used in mobile phones and seatbelt detection cameras. These systems can scan thousands of vehicles per hour and automatically identify offences, freeing up resources and increasing detection rates.\n\nQueensland has also trialled AI in traffic monitoring and predictive maintenance systems. AI sensors in Brisbane have been used to analyse traffic patterns and help city planners make data-driven decisions for future upgrades.\n\nSouth Australian Transport Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the new trial will positively impact motorists across the state in a number of ways.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"They\u2019ll save time and money in terms of infrastructure, time and money in terms of being stuck in traffic, freight getting to where it\u2019s needed to go faster and more efficiently, and public transport moving more quickly,\" Mr Koutsantonis said. \"The traffic management system using AI can cost as little as $8,000 at an intersection if the infrastructure is already in place without having to put in new infrastructure.\"\n\nThe government will look to add more cameras if the trial is successful, with Koutsantonis describing the technology as a \"powerful piece of equipment to improve our traffic network\".\n\nwith NCA Newswire\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Craft-washing, the practice of making mass-produced beer look like it's locally brewed, is driving Australia's small, independent brewers out of the market.\n\nIndependent brewers say stores like Liquorland, which produce their own 'craft' beer labels, are killing small businesses. Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nIndependent breweries are sounding the alarm over what they\u2019ve dubbed \"craft-washing\" in Australia\u2019s major liquor stores, where large corporations design beers to mimic small-batch, indie brands.\n\nJonny Bucknall, founder of Freshwater Brewing Co. on Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches, says across big corporation-owned bottle shops, there are many beers featuring vibrant colours and retro designs that look locally-owned, but most people fail to realise they're just disguised supermarket beers.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, Bucknall said he believes the trend has actually resulted in the closure of several local businesses, with a total of 20 independent breweries across Australia shutting down in the year to February 2024. According to Forbes, that was directly linked to craft-washing.\n\n\"It plays a massive role,\" Bucknall told Yahoo. \"If you think where most people buy their beer, it's from supermarkets \u2014 that's a fact. With the cost of living crisis, people are shopping for beer like they used to shop for wine. They set a budget and work back from that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"People are now consolidating their purchases, and they're going direct to the bigger retailers, and then, surprise, surprise, bigger retailers' brands are cheaper.\"\n\nZytho Brewing is owned by Endeavour Group, which was formerly part of Woolworths, and operates major liquor retailers such as Dan Murphy's and BWS. Source: Dan Murphy's\n\nBeer brewer encourages Australians to shop local\n\nSupermarket brands now control more than five per cent of Australia\u2019s beer market while independents produce just seven.\n\nBucknall claimed large retailers remove independent craft beers from their shelves, giving them less space and visibility, while at the same time prioritising their own, such as Tinnies, Zytho, Sail & Anchor, and Lorry Boys.\n\nTinnies is a private-label beer brand owned by Coles Group and is available exclusively through their liquor outlets, including Liquorland, First Choice Liquor and Vintage Cellars.\n\nZytho Brewing is a product of Pinnacle Drinks, which is owned by Endeavour Group, formerly part of Woolworths. Endeavour Group operates major liquor retailers such as Dan Murphy's and BWS.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"You can see the increase in their brands,\" Bucknall said. \"Then they're getting rid of a lot of independent ones from their shelves. If this were food packaging, there\u2019d be a national scandal.\"\n\nBucknall explained how retailers go to suppliers and request a beer at a set price to secure strong profit margins, then create branding and a made-up name that mimics the look of real craft beer. He pointed out that distribution is everything in the beer industry \u2014 and that very few true independent breweries are stocked nationwide anymore.\n\nTinnies is a private-label beer brand owned by Coles Group and is exclusively sold through their liquor outlets, including Liquorland and Vintage Cellars. Source: Liquorland\n\nIn contrast, supermarket brands get automatic national distribution, which ironically builds consumer trust just through familiarity. If a shopper sees the same beer in different states, it feels reliable, even if it\u2019s not truly independent, giving these faux craft beers a significant advantage.\n\n\"If you go to the point of purchase, there's not much signage,\" Bucknall said. \"If you look at the catalogue, it looks like a regular beer. If you look at the shelf, it looks like a regular beer. Aside from a small line on the site, or on a can, I don't know how you would find out it was owned by a big corp.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd it's not just supermarkets blurring the lines \u2014 many once-beloved craft labels like Stone & Wood, Little Creatures and Balter have been snapped up by global giants like Lion and Asahi, raising fresh questions about what \"independent\" really means in today\u2019s beer market.\n\nBucknall believes there's a growing global shift towards local and direct purchasing, and hopes consumers will eventually choose to buy directly from local breweries, where they can access the same variety of styles, but with fresher and better quality beer.\n\nHow do independent breweries create a superior product?\n\nStill, Bucknall acknowledges the challenge, and says supermarkets are powerful, goal-driven machines with the resources to dominate the market. \"I think we\u2019re all just a bunch of small businesses going above and beyond in a really passionate way to brew beer that\u2019s genuinely world-class. The problem is, beer often gets commodified \u2014 seen as just another product brewed in some big warehouse far away,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"But there\u2019s a human side to it \u2014 a whole heap of workers putting in serious effort \u2014 and there\u2019s a quality side too. Beer in Australia is actually world-leading. The hops we grow are shipped globally because they\u2019re that good.\n\n\"The grain we use is some of the best in the world and wins international awards. You put all that together and you\u2019ve got a thriving, interesting industry \u2014 but it\u2019s being stifled, surprise surprise, by duopolies that don\u2019t want us to succeed.\n\n\"So I think it\u2019s just about shining a light on what\u2019s already here. There\u2019s an amazing product right on your doorstep. If you search 'brewery near me,' you'll find one \u2014 and when you visit, you\u2019ll see all the romance that comes with it.\"\n\nFreshwater Brewing has kicked off an equity crowdfund, giving everyday Aussies the chance to own a piece of the beer they love. They\u2019re aiming to raise funds to open a new bar, install their own canning line, and supercharge their grassroots, community-first model.\n\nColes, Endeavour respond to criticisms\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, A Coles Liquor spokesperson said it's simplifying its beer range as part of a major rebrand, bringing Liquorland, First Choice, and Vintage Cellars under one banner.\n\nWhile private label beers make up just 4.2 per cent per cent of its total beer offering, the company says it stocks over 640 independent craft brews, with 70 per cent of its craft range coming from independent breweries.\n\nTo help customers identify them, Coles added the Independent Brewers Association seal to relevant products online, it said. It also pointed to its sponsorship of the GABS Hottest 100 craft beer festival as part of its support for the indie brewing scene.\n\nEndeavour Group said its craft beer range has grown significantly, from around 350 products in 2014 to over 1,000 in 2025. Its own drinks arm, Pinnacle Drinks, produces a small portion of these \u2014 just 2.4 per cent of the total Australian craft beer range \u2014 and all Pinnacle beers \"are labelled as such\".\n\nThe company said product ranges are reviewed annually based on customer behaviour, sales performance, loyalty data and broader market trends.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
