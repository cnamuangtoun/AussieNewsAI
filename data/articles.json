        "text": "Tesla dominated the electric vehicle industry by the mid-2010s with sleek, fast cars that helped combat the public perception that EVs were severely limited by short ranges.\n\nNow the company, and its controversial Chief Executive, Elon Musk , face stiffer competition and political headwinds.\n\nIts EV sales fell by a record 9 per cent in 2025, amid increasing rivalry from China and the expiration of the US EV sales tax credit.\n\nIn November last year, Elon Musk offered a sneak peak of Tesla's Optimus robot. (Tesla Australia)\n\nBut Musk has been steering the company toward an audacious bet.\n\nHe believes Tesla's future won't ride on cars but on humanoid robots.\n\nOn Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, Musk laid out a literal replacement of Tesla cars by robots \u2013 announcing Tesla would discontinue the Model S and Model X in favour of making more of its Optimus robots.\n\n\"We're gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal of having one million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,\" he said.\n\nIt is the quintessential science-fiction dream of the future: Musk says Tesla's Optimus robots will do everything from cleaning your house to performing surgery.\n\nHe's called Optimus, the key to eliminating world poverty, making human work optional and reaching Mars .\n\nAnd he claims they'll be on sale by the end of 2027.\n\n\"Every human on earth is going to have their own personal R2-D2, C3PO,\" Musk said in November, referring to the personal robots from Star Wars .\n\n\"But actually, Optimus will be better than that.\"\n\nBut critics say these are fever-dream distractions from Tesla's core automotive business.\n\nAnd plenty of companies, like Boston Dynamics and Figure, are already deep into the humanoid robot business.\n\nMusk's own success and pay are directly at stake.\n\nTesla must deliver one million Optimus robots within 10 years for Musk to fully realise an almost $US1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) Tesla pay plan approved by shareholders late last year.\n\n\"Elon is a big thinker, and he wants to be pushing the edge of people's imagination,\" a former Tesla senior engineer told CNN in an interview.\n\nBut the EV and robot markets are very different, the engineer said.\n\n\"With electric vehicles, Tesla was really the only one working on this hard problem. There's a lot of companies now and tons of competition.\"\n\nMusk laid out a literal replacement of Tesla cars by robots. (Supplied)\n\n'Infinite money glitch'\n\nTesla first unveiled its humanoid robot project at a 2021 event, where a silvery figure danced to thumping techno music on a stage.\n\nIt was an actor in a robot suit, complete with a face that looked like a screen. \"Obviously, that's not real,\" Musk said as the costumed figure left the stage.\n\nJust months later, in January 2022, Musk said he thought Optimus could be \"more significant than the vehicle business\" for Tesla over time.\n\nTesla says Optimus can now sort objects, serve popcorn, throw out trash and dance.\n\nIt does \"some basic tasks in the factory,\" Musk said Wednesday, progress, but still a far cry from Musk's futuristic vision, even as he predicted Optimus could eventually generate $US10 trillion ($14 trillion) of revenue.\n\nYet Musk has set a speedy timeline for Optimus.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum this month, he said the robot will be available for sale by the end of 2027.\n\nIt is a lofty goal, one experts say may be tougher than Musk's bets on electric vehicles or SpaceX.\n\nREAD MORE: Melbourne nail salon firebombed twice in two days\n\nMusk has set a speedy timeline for Optimus. (AP)\n\nHumanoid robots are among the most complex machines imaginable, and the race to build them is already heating up.\n\nTesla is not the only company in this space.\n\nHyundai and Google DeepMind are also deploying their Atlas humanoid robot internally in the coming months before rolling it out to customers.\n\nMeanwhile, the CES tech show in January was full of companies, including Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel, showing off humanoid robots powered by their chips and technologies.\n\nMore than 90 companies have a humanoid robot product, according to Ani Kelkar, a partner at McKinsey & Company who leads the firm's advanced automation and autonomy sector. More are coming, especially in the United States and China.\n\nExperts from McKinsey, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley estimate the humanoid robot market could eventually be worth anywhere from $US370 billion ($524 billion) by 2040 to $US5 trillion ($7 trillion) by 2050.\n\nTesla does have critical advantages in its expertise in motors, batteries and mechanisms, said Ken Goldberg, a professor who supervises research in robotics and automation at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"They also understand how to make something advanced in high volume \u2013 with cost effectiveness, and that's really important,\" Goldberg said.\n\nREAD MORE: Man kept alive for 48 hours with lungs removed\n\nMusk's commentary and support of US President Donald Trump have made him a polarising figure. (AP)\n\nThe company could also benefit from using Optimus internally and selling it externally, giving it a \"cost advantage\" that could enable Tesla to make \"several thousand dollars per robot,\" Goldman Sachs said in an October report.\n\nBut most experts agree it'll be at least a decade before humanoid robots are widely deployed.\n\n\"A giant leap may happen, but we don't know when,\" Goldberg said.\n\n\"Most technology develops as a slow burn over time, so I think the expectations about having fully general humanoids seems over-inflated.\"\n\nOthers are sceptical about whether humanoid robots will ever be broadly useful in society.\n\nBill Ray, an analyst following emerging technologies and robotics for market research firm Gartner, previously told CNN that humanoid robots face too many limitations to be practical.\n\nOptimus challenges\n\nMusk has swung big with timelines before \u2013 and missed. He previously said Tesla cars would be fully autonomous by 2018, and that SpaceX would start sending rockets to Mars by 2018 \u2013 neither of which has happened yet.\n\nAnd already with Optimus, Tesla has missed its leader's ambitious schedule. Musk had initially set internal goals for Tesla to produce at least 5000 Optimus units in 2025, according to The Information .\n\nThat goal was slashed to 2000 a few months later and has been lowered again since, The Information reported in October.\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nMusk has acknowledged that his goals are not easy.\n\n\"Right now, we're struggling with the final design of the hardware,\" especially of the arm and hand, Musk said at the All In Summit in September.\n\n\"Human-like hands are notoriously hard for robots to emulate. Unlike people, robots have a hard time knowing how to grip different objects like a wet glass versus a piece of metal.\n\n\"People think of space travel as extraordinarily difficult, and it is, no doubt, but it turns out that getting a robot to reliably tie a sneaker is harder than getting a rocket out of the atmosphere,\" Goldberg said.\n\nMusk's political commentary and support of US President Donald Trump have also made him a polarising figure, resulting in protests and vandalism at Tesla dealerships across the country.\n\nProtests and vandalism occured at Tesla dealerships across the country. (Getty)\n\nA man uses chalk to write messages on the side of a San Francisco Tesla store during a protest. (AP Photo/Noah Berger)\n\n\"If they won't buy his cars, why would they buy a huge robot for their home from him?\" posted Ross Gerber, an early Tesla investor and CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, who is now a prominent critic of Musk.\n\nMusk acknowledged the \"many who doubt our ambitions for creating amazing abundance\" on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\n\"But we're confident it can be done, and that we're making the right moves technologically to ensure that it does.\"\n\n\"And Tesla's obviously never been a company to shy away from solving some of the hardest problems,\" he added.\n\nBut Musk's version of the future won't happen instantly \u2013 and maybe not for a long time.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary, but he promises things that sometimes may take more time than his engineers can deliver,\" said Goldberg.\n\n\"The research community all over the world is working very hard on this, but it's not going to get solved overnight.\"",

        "text": "Nine Entertainment has taken a loss by selling its radio network to billionaire pub baron Arthur Laundy as the media company takes a big punt on outdoor advertising.\n\nMr Laundy's Laundy Family Office will pay $56 million for the network, which includes Melbourne's top-rating talk station 3AW, Sydney's 2GB and a stable of presenters, including Ben Fordham and Tom Elliott.\n\nMr Laundy has an estimated net worth of $1.75 billion and owns more than 40 pubs in NSW.\n\nHe is the father of former Liberal MP Craig Laundy, who was a junior minister in Malcolm Turnbull's government, and Stu Laundy, a former contestant on Network 10's dating show The Bachelorette.\n\nThe sale price is far less than the $275m the network was worth just seven years ago when Nine took full control of what was then known as Macquarie Media.\n\nArthur Laundy (left) appeared on Clinton Maynard's 2GB show in August 2025. (Supplied: 2GB)\n\nAt the time, Macquarie's Sydney stars included Alan Jones \u2014 currently before the courts charged with multiple counts of indecent assault \u2014 and Ray Hadley, who retired last year.\n\nNine's culture of bullying and sexual harassment revealed Bosses in Nine's broadcast division would belittle, intimidate, gaslight and sexually harass employees, and when complaints were made against management, HR would cover it up.\n\nLong-time 3AW breakfast host Neil Mitchell, who dominated the ratings in Melbourne, also retired in 2023.\n\nThe exit of stars added extra pressure on top of the continued decline of the entire talk radio industry as digital media grabbed younger audiences and left broadcasters competing for a shrinking band of baby boomer listeners.\n\nAt the same time as selling the radio stations, Nine on Friday splashed $850m buying outdoor ad company QMS from private equity group Quadrant.\n\nIt also sold its regional TV station, NBN, to affiliate WIN, which already rebroadcasts Nine throughout much of Australia, for $14.8m.\n\nNine has lost faith in the future of radio, analysts say. (ABC News)\n\nNine chief executive Matt Stanton told the stock exchange the shake-up would \"create a more efficient, higher-growth, and digitally powered Nine Group for our consumers, advertisers, shareholders and people\".\n\nVeteran media analyst Peter Cox said this contradicted the positive narrative about radio put out by Nine's competitor, the newly merged Seven West Media and Southern Cross Austereo.\n\n\"Southern Cross and Seven are saying radio is the future,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"But here's Nine saying that 'No, we don't think that's the future, it's billboards by the side of the road'.\n\n\" I'm a great believer that traditional media is dying; I've been saying that for many years in many ways. \"\n\nNine is expected to reap about $50m in cash from the sale after transaction costs and debt adjustments are made.\n\nCEO Matt Stanton says he hopes the shake-up will make Nine's business model \"more efficient\". (Supplied)\n\nThis will be booked as a gain of about $10m because last year the company dramatically wrote down the value of the network in its accounts.\n\nNine the latest casualty from slowing economy In announcing 200 job losses on Friday, Nine Entertainment has joined other commercial media outlets in feeling the chill from a cooling economy as more corporate budgets slash their marketing spend.\n\nIt also stands to book a tax benefit of about $50m because for tax purposes it is making a loss compared to the original purchase price.\n\nThe sale of the radio network will be greeted with relief by many inside Nine's publishing division, which runs metro mastheads The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald as well as The Australian Financial Review.\n\nSome within the relatively buttoned-up newspaper division have been unhappy to be sharing ownership with the more rambunctious right-wingers at the radio network.\n\nHowever, Nine told the ASX it would continue to collaborate with the radio stations under the Laundy group's ownership.\n\n\"Laundy is expected to remain a long-term partner of Nine, with plans to utilise Nine News journalists on radio, showcase Stan Sport through Laundy venues, provide promotion and advertising sales collaboration, as well as increased advertising spend by Laundy on Nine properties,\" the company said.",

        "text": "The federal health minister says there are no immediate plans to tighten border controls after cases of a deadly virus were detected in India.\n\nNipah virus has been detected in two people in West Bengal and countries across Asia are stepping up health screening measures, including at airports.\n\nThe virus is most commonly spread by fruit bats and although infections in people are rare, the World Health Organisation said it can have a 40 to 75 per cent fatality rate in humans.\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler told ABC's Radio National the federal government was taking the situation seriously but was not considering additional border measures.\n\n\"We don't have any advice at the moment to change our existing protocols for sick travellers who arrive in Australia. There already are protocols for that, but we'll continue to watch the situation closely,\" Mr Butler said.\n\n\"There's reason to hope that this has been contained.\"\n\nAirport health authorities are monitoring passengers from international flights arriving in Bangkok, Thailand. (Suvarnabhumi Airport Office /Handout via Reuters)\n\n'We shouldn't panic': expert\n\nThe virus, which has never been detected in Australia, is a zoonotic disease like COVID-19 and Ebola, meaning it's spread from animals to humans, but there are major differences to COVID-19 in how it spreads, as it is not transmissible through airborne droplets.\n\n\"It's very difficult to transmit between humans,\" Mr Butler said.\n\n\"It requires very close personal contact between humans and the exchange effectively of bodily fluids.\"\n\nSanjaya Senanayake, associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University, said there was \"no reason to panic\" .\n\n\"It is not a brand new virus. It's been around since 1999 \u2026 and we see annual outbreaks of Nipah virus in countries like Bangladesh every year,\" Dr Senanayake said.\n\n\"It's something we've known about for a long time and we have outbreaks every year in that region of Asia and we haven't panicked before, so we shouldn't panic now.\"\n\nTwo Nipah cases had been detected at the Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, since December. (AP Photo)\n\nThe Australian Centre for Disease Control said it is uncommon for the virus to spread between people, as prolonged close contact with an infected person is required for transmission, such as when a healthcare worker is caring for an infected patient.\n\nThere is no vaccine for Nipah virus but the World Health Organisation says several candidate vaccines are currently in different stages of development.\n\nVaccine development has faced challenges because outbreak sizes are generally small which makes vaccine efficacy trials difficult to conduct.\n\nDr Sanjaya Senanayake says it's not a brand new virus and is difficult to transmit. (Supplied)\n\nDr Senanayake said only about 750 cases of Nipah virus have been recorded in almost 30 years.\n\n\"I suspect if we ever got to a stage where there were concerns about pandemics like COVID, the research and production could be ramped up,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't have any antivirals against it. So if someone does get Nipah, it's what we call supportive care, just general measures.\"\n\nMore screening at some Asian borders\n\nSeveral Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Pakistan have ramped up health screening at their borders in recent days with some airports using thermal screening or body temperature scanners to check travellers, particularly those arriving from India.\n\nThe precautions come as the region prepares for a travel surge over the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday season which begins in about a fortnight.\n\nAsian countries taking no chances with deadly virus Two cases of the Nipah virus have been detected in India, prompting a raft of screening measures to be enacted in countries across Asia.\n\nHowever, India's health ministry said there was no plan to screen passengers at Indian airports as the situation did not justify it.\n\n\"There is no outbreak. There were just two cases in one district in [West] Bengal and there is no spread,\" an official told Reuters.\n\nThe ministry said it had traced 196 close contacts of the two positive cases and all had tested negative for the virus.\n\nThe two infected people are nurses at the same hospital and one is likely to be discharged from hospital soon while the other remains in a critical condition.\n\nNipah virus can cause flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, vomiting and shortness of breath four days to three weeks after infection.\n\nIn some cases, people develop pneumonia or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), but most people who survive make a full recovery.",

(AAP: Jono Searle)\n\nTalks took place last year about Andrews being the Lions' sole captain.\n\nBut due to the success the Lions have had with co-captains \u2014 Dayne Zorko was skipper for five seasons before 2023 \u2014 Fagan is superstitious about changing that.\n\nA player vote will take place in February that will help shape Brisbane's captaincy system for 2026.\n\n\"Harris Andrews could easily be captain on his own,\" Fagan said.\n\n\"I am not a fan of the two-captain model but since we have had it, we have been successful.\n\n\"I don't know if I want one or two.\n\n\"If it's two, then you look at Hugh McCluggage and Josh Dunkley and it's hard to split those two blokes.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

        "text": "Australia's top wheelchair basketball team was \"devastated\" to learn it had been withdrawn from this season's national competition, sparking calls to \"urgently\" reverse the shock decision.\n\nIn a joint statement released on Thursday, Darwin Salties co-captains Tom O'Neill-Thorne and CJ McCarthy-Grogan revealed players only heard about the decision \u2014 made overnight on Wednesday \u2014 through media the following morning.\n\nThey said Basketball NT (BNT) provided players with \"no reason\" for pulling out of the National Wheelchair Basketball League (NWBL) 2026 season and said there had been \"no prior consultation with the team\".\n\nTom O'Neill-Thorne and CJ McCarthy-Grogan co-captained the Darwin team to three consecutive National Wheelchair Basketball League championships. (Supplied)\n\nO'Neill-Thorne said players had been \"totally blindsided\" and \"devastated by the sudden and unexplained decision\" from BNT.\n\n\"It's shattering for the team but, more than us, it's distressing that the next generation of wheelchair basketball players might not get the same opportunities we all got playing for the Salties,\" he said.\n\n\"We're still trying to get some answers on what's happened but we are appealing directly to Basketball NT to reverse the decision.\"\n\nThe Darwin Salties joined the national men's wheelchair basketball competition in 2022, taking home the past three consecutive championships including last year's grand final in Sydney, and players have gone on to represent Australia at the 2023 World Championships and 2024 Paris Paralympics.\n\n\"The Salties have helped put the NT on the national and international wheelchair basketball map,\" McCarthy-Grogan said.\n\n\" That should be supported, not shut out. \"\n\nWhy was the team withdrawn?\n\nMcCarthy-Grogan urged BNT to \"provide transparency\" around how the decision was made, and said the team \"finding out through a media statement is incredibly disappointing\".\n\nHe worried about the potential flow-on impacts to \"disability representation, opportunity and pathways in the Northern Territory\".\n\nSpeaking with ABC Radio Darwin this week, McCarthy-Grogan said the decision was particularly upsetting in the lead-up to Australia hosting the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\"We'd made so much progress over the years and, in the lead-up to the 2032 Games in Brisbane and Gold Coast, you would expect that they would have been supportive but unfortunately, it's not the case,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, BNT said it \"acknowledges and shares the disappointment felt by the basketball community\" in response to the decision.\n\nThe Darwin Salties first heard about the withdrawal decision in a media release. (Supplied)\n\nIt said Darwin Basketball Association (DBA) previously held the NWBL licence and operated the Top End wheelchair basketball program, but when DBA \"entered administration in December 2025\" BNT was asked if \"it would assume responsibility for fielding a new Darwin team for the 2026 season\".\n\nThe BNT board decided it couldn't \"take on the financial and operational risks of entering a national league team without committed ongoing funding\", which it described as a \"prudent but difficult decision\".\n\n\"As a result of DBA ceasing operations, BNT is focused on commencing a new Darwin local competition, rebuilding governance confidence and long-term financial sustainability of basketball across the territory,\" the statement said.\n\n'A line in the sand'\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, WBA executive general manager John Palmer told ABC Radio Darwin the national body had been \"confident\" Basketball NT could \"move forward\" until \"very recently\".\n\n\"We've extended our deadline compared to other teams \u2014 over six weeks longer than any other team \u2014 and unfortunately, NT Basketball couldn't meet those deadlines as of this morning when we were notified, after a board meeting last night, that NT Basketball had decided not to move forward with the licence, so disappointing all around,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a difficult decision.\n\n\"From the financial prudence point of view, I suppose we needed to say; 'Look, there's a line in the sand', we needed an answer and that's where we're at.\"\n\nHow two NT friends helped form the Darwin Salties Tom and CJ have been friends for decades. Now the two mates, who had to leave home for their sporting opportunities, have reunited to bring those opportunities home.\n\nIn a statement to the ABC on Friday, Mr Palmer said \"the Darwin Salties depart the league at the very top of the sport\".\n\n\"While the Salties will not take the court in 2026, the league remains committed to supporting the growth of para-sport in the region,\" he said.\n\nHe thanked the team for being \"a benchmark for excellence\", fans of the sport, and the staff and volunteers who worked to keep the league running.\n\n\"Their dominance on the court was matched only by the fervour of the Darwin fans who turned the stadium into a fortress,\" Mr Palmer said.",

(ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"I used to make it just in the winter periods and then some of the older fellas said to me, 'Can't you do this all year round?'\" she said.\n\n\"They love it. I don't mind making it, but I have never tasted it.\"\n\nIt is this kind of dedication that has Mount Gambier and District Saleyards in the running for Saleyards Australia's Best Canteen competition, which is encouraging people to vote for their favourite site.\n\nSaleyards Australia executive officer Amy Perfrement said every saleyard had its own characters, but the canteens were often the heart and soul of livestock exchanges.\n\nWorkers put a lot of effort into Australian Saleyards' canteens. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"One part of saleyards that's often forgotten about is the canteen ... we wanted to just shine a bit of a spotlight on those unsung heroes that keep everyone fed and watered on sale day and sometimes the days either side of that,\" she said.\n\nThere are just under 80 canteens across the country that are registered as Saleyards Australia members, and many more unregistered operators.\n\nOften run by small businesses, volunteers, or community groups, Ms Perfrement said the canteens helped foster connection, goodwill and a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nAlongside the vanilla slices, bacon and egg sandwiches and fresh coffee, the canteens are often a meeting place for rural communities.\n\nLiz Beames grew up on a farm and says her background helps her to connect with the community. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"It's a place where people can come in and meet, have a chat, maybe a debrief, and it really is that social fabric of saleyards,\" Ms Perfrement said.\n\nMore than just a canteen\n\nWhen Liz Beames first started at the Mount Gambier saleyards as the canteen manager, she thought she might stay for maybe three months.\n\nIn May, she will have been in the role for 18 years.\n\nOver those years of serving the saleyard community, she counts many of them as family.\n\nThe business has been a family affair for Liz Beames, who has worked alongside her husband and children over the years. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"I love them all, they're great. They're salt of the earth people, and I love what I do, and I want that to come through in my food,\" Ms Beames said.\n\nAnd like family, Ms Beames knows exactly what each regular wants to order.\n\n\"There is a few that have been here for a long time and I know that they will have the bacon, eggs, bit of toast \u2014 always the same,\" she said.\n\nBreakfast is popular at the Mount Gambier and District Saleyards. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nMeantime, Megan Ireland \u2014 who runs the Naracoorte saleyard canteen, which is also in the running \u2014 agrees that homemade meals cooked with love were always a winner.\n\n\"I make everything from scratch, from my homemade jelly slice to a fresh soup in winter or a salad in summer,\" she said.\n\n\"I like to support local business as well, so local eggs, the local butcher, the bakery.\"\n\nA hot meal and a welcoming smile are what make saleyard canteens a farmer favourite. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nShe also agrees that some of the best customers are the ones who are not even there to take part in the sale.\n\n\"Some of the older blokes come in every Tuesday or every Friday just so they can feel like they're a part of it,\" Ms Ireland said.\n\n\"They're some of our favourite customers. Every single sale day they sit at the same table, they order the same thing, and they give you the same smile.\"\n\nA community hub\n\nDavid Wallis is the saleyards manager in Mount Gambier and knows all too well the importance of a good saleyard canteen.\n\nDavid Wallis says canteen workers deserve recognition. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"This is a hub where people feel like they're involved. Farmers are often isolated in what they do, and so to come to the saleyards, and in particular the canteen, they feel like they have someone that is happy to have a chat,\" he said.\n\n\" It's more than just a feed in the canteen, it's about wellbeing as well. \"\n\nSaleyard canteens around the country keep sellers, buyers and agents well fed on busy days. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nMr Wallis said canteens could act as a barometer of how the community was feeling.\n\n\"[Liz Beames] will come to me and say, 'Oh, the vibe today is amazing', or there might be other days where it might be a really elongated day, and people are tired,\" he said.\n\n\"But she also is just an ear for many.\"\n\nAnd the saleyard canteen is never missed by Mr Wallis either.\n\n\"I have been here nearly six years and I have eaten every sale day here,\" he said.\n\n\"[Ms Beames] has this bad habit of bringing in a little bowl of lollies to people when they have worked real long hours.\n\nSaleyards Australia wants to find the best saleyards canteen in the country. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"You have just about had enough for the day, and Liz will come in with a smile and say, 'Just to keep you going', and walk out again.\n\n\"It's those little things that make a lot of difference.\"\n\nVoting for Australia's Best Saleyards Canteen closes at 11pm on Saturday, January 31, with the winner announced in February.",

(Supplied: Paul Thomas)\n\nPublic transport enthusiast Paul Thomas travelled up to Lithgow to board the V-Set train's victory lap.\n\nThe social media vlogger embarked on the journey with hundreds of others early on Friday morning, with the belief its final trip would be a celebration as opposed to a sombre occasion.\n\n\"I was at Lithgow Station at five in the morning,\" he said.\n\n\"There were lots of people there, probably 300 or 400 rail fans, waiting for this train to come in.\"\n\n'Blue Goose' V-Set train on its debut in October 1977 at Katoomba. (ABC News)\n\nMr Thomas said it was quite the party in the second car, but in his carriage the atmosphere was quite civilised.\n\nDemand to board the Blue Goose's final run caused delays to the service, leaving eager commuters waiting on station platforms.\n\nThousands packed Sydney's Central Station this morning to say goodbye. (ABC News: Abubakr Sajid)\n\nBut for some passengers, the wait brought back the feeling of nostalgia rather than frustration.\n\n\"It brings back those childhood memories,\" said Katie Laws, who brought her family to Penrith Station to watch the model roll next to the platform for the final time.\n\n\"The trains being late helps too \u2026 bringing back those memories of waiting and getting on the train, running for the train.\"\n\nThe V-Set class has been replaced with the Mariyung Fleet. (ABC News: Anushri Sood)\n\nThe V-Set class will be succeeded by the Mariyung Fleet, which has already replaced trains on the Central Coast and Newcastle lines.\n\nDespite passengers being unable to flip the seats on the newer model, train devotees welcome the trade-off for larger bathrooms and a quieter journey.\n\nAged just 10 years old, Zedd woke up at 5am to board the train with his dad.\n\nHe told the ABC he would miss travelling to the mountains on the Blue Goose, but was excited to be \"part of history\".\n\n\"This is one of the best trains on the inner-city network,\" he said.\n\n\"Also, this train is just nostalgic.\"\n\nZedd says he was excited to be \"part of history\". (ABC News.)\n\n'An emotional moment'\n\nThousands eagerly packed Central Station to watch the train terminate for the final time.\n\nAs the last passengers of the V-Set disembarked, they were greeted to fanfare and a live band.\n\nTransport Minister John Graham said it was an emotional day for not only Sydney's rail network, but generations of commuters.\n\n\"There's no question these V-Sets will be really missed as they retire today,\" he said.\n\n\"Incredible to have so many people down here... as we wave off for the final time these V-set trains.\"\n\nTransport Minister John Graham and V-Set train driver Peter Gunczy. (ABC News: Abubakr Sajid)\n\nLong-serving train driver, Peter Gunczy, said he was honoured to be given the opportunity to retire the fleet.\n\n\"I've spent the best part of 41 years driving these V-Sets,\" he said.\n\n\" It's really, really emotional for me personally. I'm trying really hard to not well up. \"\n\nPublic to decide future of V-Set train carriages\n\nThe 'Blue Goose' V-Set used for the final service will be preserved for future train enthusiasts, with the fate of the other 81 retired carriages up to the public.\n\nDr Clinton expects most will be turned into scrap metal, but hopes to see some provided with a new life.\n\n\"In the past, we've seen them being repurposed as cafes and for accommodation,\" he said.\n\n\"Train carriages around the world have also been repurposed for things like artificial reefs, as they make a good artificial reef.\"",

        "text": "Kevin Muscat has managed Shanghai Port to two successive Chinese title triumphs but the Australian will face a huge hurdle if he goes for the \"three-peat\" after the champions were hit with a points deduction following an investigation into football corruption.\n\nShanghai, who won the Chinese Super League by just two points, must begin their defence of the title in March on minus five points after they were among nine top-flight clubs who were hit \u2060with substantial punishments announced by the Chinese FA on Thursday.\n\nShanghai Shenhua, who were runners-up to their neighbours, got an even tougher sanction of a 10-point deduction, along with Tianjin Jinmen Tiger, \u200cwho came sixth.\n\nMuscat has enjoyed tremendous success as a manager throughout Asia. (Getty Images: Clicks Images)\n\nThe punishments \u200dhave been handed out by authorities after an investigation into football-related gambling and match manipulation, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nThe 52-year-old Muscat, who earned a reputation as one of the toughest, most uncompromising defenders in the British game, has since become hugely successful as a manager, with two titles in charge of Melbourne Victory and another with Yokohama F Marinos in Japan.\n\nHis exploits in China have since kept him on the radar of British clubs, and he had been in line to take over as manager of Scottish giants Rangers last October before the deal fell through.\n\nWhether his attitude to life at his lucratively funded club will be changed by their punishment is not known, but only this week, Muscat's name has again come up in connection with the vacant manager's job at Championship side Leicester City, who sacked their boss Marti Cifuentes last week.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAlso, after the punishments in China, Qingdao Hainiu will start the season on minus seven \u200cpoints while Henan FC and Shandong Taishan were both hit with six-point deductions.\n\nWuhan Three Towns, Zhejiang FC and Beijing \u200dGuoan will start on minus five points alongside Port.\n\nThe teams have also been fined between 200,000 and 1 million yuan ($41,071 to $204,000).\n\nThe Chinese FA also said former CFA president Chen Xuyuan and ex-China coach Li Tie were among 73 people barred from football-related activities for life.\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nVictoria-based fresh produce marketing company All Aussie Farmers has been working for several years to bring the purple tomato to Australia from the United States.\n\nManaging director Travis Murphy said the fruit had a \"really sweet\" flavour.\n\n\"I'm not a tomato eater, I can openly admit that, but I can eat these purple tomatoes. They're beautiful,\" he said.\n\nMelbourne first to stock\n\nNow that it is approved, All Aussie Farmers can begin growing and selling the Purple Bliss locally.\n\nTravis Murphy says the purple tomato has a sweet flavour. (Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nThey will be on sale in Melbourne fruit shops around the middle of the year before expanding to other markets.\n\n\"Because this is such a unique product, we want to control how it's introduced,\" Mr Murphy said.\n\n\"We'll be selling them ourselves off our own wholesale floor so we're handling everything end-to-end,\" he said.\n\n\"We can make sure the product is handled properly and that the grower is getting paid fairly.\"\n\nThat first grower is based in Queensland, in the Clearview Valley.\n\nTravis Murphy (left) says it has been challenging to get regulatory approval for the purple tomato. (Supplied: All Aussie Farmers)\n\nMr Murphy said they were chosen because their main crop of medley tomatoes was wiped out by hail just before Christmas.\n\n\"He's a careful, committed grower who puts a lot of effort into his fruit,\" Mr Murphy said.\n\n\"That means we can deliver a top-quality product to fruit shops who can then pass that quality on to consumers.\"\n\nA question for the consumer\n\nVictorian Farmers Federation president Brett Hosking welcomed the go-ahead for the GM tomato, saying it was important technology was embraced.\n\nBrett Hosking says science and farming work hand in hand. (Supplied: GrainGrowers)\n\n\"We're starting to realise that science and food production work hand in hand,\" he said.\n\n\"The way we ensure consumers get the best eating experience is by embracing what we know from research, innovation and technology combined with traditional growing practices.\n\n\"A lot of GM food products in Australia aren't actually consumed directly.\n\n\"Take canola, for example, we produce oil from it, [but] that oil doesn't contain any of the DNA.\n\n\"This tomato though is a product you put straight on your plate. A fresh food that you chop up and eat whole.\"\n\nSecond GM 'wave' unlikely\n\nUnlike the purple tomato, most other GM crops in Australia are bred to solve pest, disease and agricultural issues.\n\nBut molecular plant biologist Joseph Pegler from the University of Newcastle doubts there would be a surge of GM crops modified for nutrition.\n\n\"It's certainly possible that we'll see more genetically modified crops in the future,\" Dr Pegler said.\n\n\"But this doesn't mean we're about to see a large influx of GM crops released into the Australian environment.\n\n\"The regulation around genetically modified organisms in Australia is very strict and highly transparent.\"",

He pulls his phone from his pocket, lights up the screen and focuses on her image. It is a reassuring habit the 31-year-old moguls specialist has formed since becoming a father in September 2024 that will help drive him towards Winter Olympics gold next month. \u201cI found myself doing it just this past season, which I didn\u2019t expect,\u201d he tells this masthead. Matt Graham with a world championships silver medal in 2023. Credit: Getty Images \u201cShe\u2019s my background on my phone, so during competitions, when the stakes are high and the pressures up, I\u2019d often just like, pull my phone out, just open it up, sort of blow her a kiss and just say, \u2018let\u2019s f...ing go\u2019. \u201cI just found myself doing that naturally. It wasn\u2019t planned. It\u2019s more my way of just getting in the zone and getting amped up for the event.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGraham has embraced fatherhood. Despite the added complications for an athlete who lives in Sydney and competes on the other side of the globe, it provides him with extra motivation as he prepares for the Olympics in northern Italy, which begin on February 6. \u201cMy day-to-day life as an athlete hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot,\u201d he says. \u201cBut mentally, it\u2019s quite different. I feel like there\u2019s more purpose when I\u2019m away. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it just for me.\u201d Matt Graham during moguls qualfying at the 2022 Beijing Games. Credit: Getty Graham and his partner Jess had daughter Ada in September 2024 and were married 13 months later in October last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a big step, obviously,\u201d he says. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s a parent sort of knows that the transition can be quite full on. But yeah, I mean, Jess and I were both ready to become parents. \u201cWe\u2019d obviously spoken about it a lot, leading up to us trying to be parents, and then once it eventually happened, it was about preparing for the hard times when I was going to be away.\u201d Graham had a patchy season last year. But he bounced back in sparkling fashion last month, winning a World Cup moguls event in Ruka, Finland. It was a unique double for Australia as Jakara Anthony also won gold. \u201cMy performances in the past season were, it was a bit of a rocky road,\u201d Graham says. \u201cBut the failures, or the times I didn\u2019t succeed on the competition tour, it made it easier to get over because I would just go home and get Jess on FaceTime and, I mean, yeah, my daughter, Ada, she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just smiling and yapping away. So it makes that easier to sort of push past and move on from those downtimes.\u201d Graham hit a low point in December 2021. Coming off an Olympic silver medal in South Korea in 2018, he broke his collarbone in a heavy fall in Sweden just two months out from the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Despite an intensive rehabilitation program, he was far from his best. He competed in pain and finished 29th. Matt Graham during moguls qualifying at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Credit: Getty The experience rocked Graham. He admits he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d and considered calling time on his career. But the qualified civil engineer made some adjustments and rediscovered his love of the sport before he had to overcome more setbacks. His collarbone hadn\u2019t healed properly, and he was sent for further surgery. \u201cGenerally speaking, a broken collarbone is an easy injury to come back from, but unfortunately, mine was a little bit more complicated,\u201d Graham told the NSW Institute of Sport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had some issues with the bone healing. Consequently, I had to undergo four completely separate surgeries, which prolonged the injury over a two-year period.\u201d After the operations and three sets of plates and screws, Graham then had to rediscover the right mindset. \u201cSometimes, you know, you\u2019ll have a big crash, a big stumble, and you\u2019ve got to get back up and right your wrong, and learn from that mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve developed a bit of a way to push past those things and just know that I\u2019ll be fine. If I attack a course, and I\u2019m hesitant or conservative, then I\u2019m at more risk than if I more or less just attack it. \u201cSometimes a moguls course can be pretty daunting, it can be steep, it can be icy, in some cases it can be a little bit scary. So, I guess you have to have a screw or two loose to take that step and really attack each day in each competition. \u201c[But] I\u2019d say generally I\u2019m quite conservative in life. The risks we do out in the snow, they\u2019re very calculated.\n\nAdvertisement",

Matriarch Pat (Meredith Rogers) is a soft-spoken retiree whose kitchen becomes the focal point of the play, brilliantly materialised by Bethany J. Fellows\u2019s set design. Helen (Michelle Perera) is a widow with a heart of gold and a penchant for baking. A proud lesbian, Keira (Rebecca Bower) self-medicates with alcohol to withstand living in a cloistered town. Barb\u2019s niece Jo (Brigid Gallacher) is the conservative black sheep of the group. And sporty Nic (Oliver Ayres) used to go by Nicole, until they announce they\u2019re transitioning into a man. The reprisal is swift. The elder members of the group, Pat and Helen, paradoxically take it in their stride, but Keira is incensed by the perceived loss of a lesbian peer, and Jo insists it\u2019s all but a phase. The remainder of the play details the fallout of Nic continuously insisting on his personhood against bad-faith arguments and a gulf of miscomprehensions. As the kindest, most level-headed character, Helen is who most audiences will project themselves onto. But Perera, so brilliant in This Is Living, is also the strongest of the ensemble. Her comedic timing is impeccable as she expertly oscillates between empathetic displays of allyship and perfectly executed moments of humour that imbue the play with levity at key junctures.

But at close to three hours, The Placeholder is simply too long. MacEllen\u2019s script retreads familiar ground in the play\u2019s second act, which drags lugubriously to its emotional climax(es). The tenuous connecting thread of a makeshift charity doesn\u2019t explain why these characters are so invested in one another, and why they tolerate unconscionable behaviour \u2013 particularly from Jo. As a result, the emotional payoffs are muted, hampered further by unnatural, dialogue-heavy exposition and uneven acting during key dramatic reveals. Much is left unresolved by close. Keira\u2019s alcohol addiction continues to be the butt of jokes, Pat\u2019s clear descent into dementia is unremarked upon. String-heavy interludes between scenes are peppered with a greatest hits compilation of what happened in the intervening years \u2013 good, bad, ridiculous. But the cacophony, so effective initially in illustrating the overwhelm of the plebiscite, overpowers the play by the end. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

Got it Share A A A\n\nPlucky ASX-listed gold junior Premier1 has locked up full ownership of one of the Yalgoo greenstone belt\u2019s last remaining gold packages in Western Australia, not already in the hands of a multi-billion dollar gold producer. The company says it has secured complete control over 266 square kilometres of prime Yalgoo real estate, as the relentless WA gold consolidation by district majors continues to unfold and gold jumps to a monstrous price of US$5500 (A$7800) an ounce. Reverse circulation drilling underway at Premier1\u2019s Yalgoo gold project. The deal completes the final piece in Premier1\u2019s evolving WA gold narrative, positioning the company as the remaining independent player in a greenstone belt tug-of-war between the $9.7 billion Ramelius Resources and the $7.3 billion Capricorn Metals. The company and its high-grade Wadgingarra gold prospect are now sitting pretty, with a 13,000-ounce starter resource grading an enticing 2.7 grams per tonne (g/t) gold at the top end of the Yalgoo-Singleton greenstone belt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These transactions simplify the ownership structure and grant the Company full control\u2019 Premier1 executive director Simon Phillips Ramelius holds most of the northern flank after its mid-2025 acquisition of Spartan Resources for a lazy $2.4 billion, while Capricorn has steadily expanded south thanks to a $188 million Warriedar-Golden Range acquisition and a landgrab of Tempest\u2019s ground in December of last year. Premier1 says its tenure sits squarely in the middle of these two players and shares all the same shears and geological signatures that have made the underexplored region so very valuable to all its neighbours. Newly appointed Premier1 executive director Simon Phillips said: \u201cConsolidating 100% ownership of Yalgoo represents a significant strategic milestone for Premier1. These transactions simplify the ownership structure and grant the Company full control over exploration, development and capital allocation decisions across a highly prospective gold portfolio.\u201d Yalgoo is a district long recognised for its high-grade orogenic gold and copper potential. The project runs along strike from the world-class Golden Grove base metals operation, which has been successfully operating for the better part of half a century and from the more recent discoveries at Capricorn Metals\u2019 Golden Range gold-antimony project to the south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPremier1\u2019s Yalgoo project lies just 10 kilometres southeast of Ramelius\u2019 Melville and Applecross prospects, which host some 5.2 million tonnes of resource at 1.4 g/t for 244,000 ounces. This ground was the focus of much of Spartan Resources\u2019 exploration and prospectivity before the multi-million-ounce discovery of Never Never at its Dalgaranga project stole the show to the Northeast. Needless to say, there remains plenty of unfinished business in the northern reaches of the Yalgoo-Singleton. 29Metal\u2019s Golden Grove base metals operation within the Yalgoo greenstone belt has been successfully operating for more than 35 years. Premier1\u2019s flagship Wadgingarra prospect at Yalgoo anchors the project, where a maiden resource of 13,000 ounces sits within a conservative Whittle-optimised pit shell drawn up last year. The high-grade gold starts at surface at site and remains open along strike and at depth. The company says limited exploration has been conducted to define its high-grade resource, with historical shallow drilling averaging just 46m in depth at the project, focused only on oxide zones near old workings. Premier1\u2019s maiden reverse-circulation program in early 2025 marked the first substantial modern drilling at the ground since the 1980\u2019s. That\u2019s a staggering amount of time considering the inherited high-grade near-surface intercepts up to 5 metres at 5.1g/t gold, 10 metres at 6.4 g/t gold and 2 metres at 20.8 g/t gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot surprisingly, then, the newer rod spin last year not only confirmed the presence of gold but also delivered some of the strongest intercepts recorded on the project. At its Crescent prospect in the north, one hole returned a staggering 3m hit running 31.5g/t gold from just 97m, including 1m at 91.9g/t gold, confirming bonanza-grade potential along trend from historical high-grade zones. At the company\u2019s Carlisle prospect to the south, drilling extended mineralisation eastward with a 10-metre hit grading a handy 3.1g/t gold from 19m, including 7m at 4.3 g/t gold. A new zone west of Olive Queen also intersected mineralisation for the first time, with 1m at 1.5g/t gold within broader anomalous intervals and pathfinder support. The results were a fantastic first go at the ground, built directly on systematic work by Premier1. The intercepted structures identified from high-resolution magnetics and rock-chip sampling were full of high-grade gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company says it\u2019s eager to get back onto the ground and test its litany of litho-structural targets, including its fast-emerging Mt Kersey prospect in the East. Work at Mt Kersey has turned up a multi-kilometre pathfinder soil anomaly that coincides with double-digit gold grades from rock chips in what the company says is a complex structural setting linked to quartz-dolerite and gabbro rocks similar to regional gold systems. Premier1 boasts some 25kms of proven shear at Wadgingarra, where the shear trends under cover for kilometres to the south, offering scope for regional aircore and magnetics to chase previously overlooked district-scale extensions. The company, however, is far from a one-trick pony. Its second major project \u2013 Abbotts North - lies up the road in perhaps one of WA\u2019s most active gold regions, along the Meekathara-Murchison greenstone belt. The project is a key second pillar to the company\u2019s portfolio and sits just 35km north of Meekatharra in the Abbotts greenstones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is also just 20 kilometres from ASX-darling New Murchison Gold\u2019s Crown Prince deposit, which has propelled that company\u2019s market capitalisation towards A$800 million after making the high-grade discovery just 2 years ago. Rochefort \u2013 the flagship prospect at Abbotts North \u2013 sits along strike from New Murchison and has emerged as a priority walk-up target, thanks to a 350m-by-350m gold anomaly above a dolerite host rock. Heritage clearances are advancing for a planned regional aircore drill program and an ultrafine soil sampling campaign later in the year, both backed by an existing $180,000 EIS government grant and a $180,000 drill credit with Strike Drilling, all waiting in Premier1\u2019s back pocket. The company\u2019s prime ground is now paired with renewed corporate drive, as experienced gold hand Simon Phillips takes the reins. With a career spanning discovery to development, his promotion comes alongside a $650,000 raise to sustain exploration momentum into 2026. Also joining the revitalised company is Mr Dale Hanna. A chartered accountant with more than 20 years of experience across ASX-listed resource companies, his background spans the full spectrum of mining operations from early-stage exploration through to production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining Hanna and Phillips on the board, previous managing director Jason Froud - who helped steer Premier1 through its strategic pivot from lithium to gold \u2013 will stay on, transitioning to a non-executive director role. Boasting shallow high-grade gold at Wadgingarra, walk-up targets at Mt Kersey and numerous processing options in the region, the company\u2019s Yalgoo gold tilt looks to be only beginning. As majors build empires to the north and south of both the company\u2019s projects, Premier1 and its expanding resources could soon add even more shine to the region\u2019s reputation. For now, though, the gold minnow - capped at just $6.5 million - is looking at a fresh new chapter of drilling in 2026 and hopeful it can turn that potential into reality.

Got it Share A A A\n\nMore than 100,000 Queensland public servants are on track to pocket an inflation-driven pay bump of up to $500, heaping further pressure on the state\u2019s ballooning debt. Following higher-than-expected inflation figures this week in which Brisbane led the nation on 5.2 per cent, analysis suggests several workforces are set for a topped-up annual wage rise. Queensland public servants could be in for a wage boost. Matt Dennien The potential for inflation uplift included in state wage deals inked last year forced the Crisafulli government to set aside $169 million in its December budget update \u2013 amid concern from ratings agencies and economists. Bargaining concessions from government last year added $345 million above the budgeted cost of its blanket wage policy, dictating rises of 3 per cent in 2025-26, and 2.5 per cent in the following two years of the deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the finalised deals spanning police, firefighters, paramedics, nurses, doctors, health administration staff, and non-teaching school staff and others, also featured potential inflation-related pay bumps. Should the March inflation figure for Brisbane pass the agreed pay rise for that financial year, pay will instead be matched to inflation \u2013 to a 2025-26 cap of up to 0.5 per cent. Queensland Treasurer David Janetzki blamed the inflation spike on the end of electricity rebates. Renee Nowytarger For a public servant on the average sector salary of about $100,000, this could add up to $500 to their base annual pay. Any inflation-adjusted increase to pay rises will also be backdated across the entire financial year, and form the base pay rate from which future rises are also calculated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake said while the December quarter spike in Brisbane inflation was essentially an anomaly caused by energy rebates ending, the March figure was likely to be above the 3 per cent pay bump trigger. Related Article Queensland budget Qld avoids credit rating downgrade. But state\u2019s books \u2018remain grim\u2019 He said that meant the spike was essentially caused by the former Miles government\u2019s extensive pre-election rebates, criticised by some as an inflation-driving attempt to buy votes. Because of this, he believed it was \u201cludicrous that the unwinding of that is the catalyst for the paying of more taxpayer money to a smaller group of public servants\u201d. \u201cI would think the Queensland government probably needs to prepare itself to have a stoush over that,\u201d Eslake told this masthead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cQueensland isn\u2019t in the worst [budget] position of Australian states \u2026 but Queensland\u2019s financial position has deteriorated quite significantly from what was the best in the country. \u201cAnd this would be another serious blow to that.\u201d Treasurer David Janetzki\u2019s office stressed the headline annual inflation rise in Queensland to November was below the national headline figure, which meant the growth revealed this week was caused by short-term factors \u2013 primarily the end of electricity rebates. He also criticised Labor for enacting temporary cost-of-living measures, saying his government was \u201cdoing its bit to ease cost pressures facing families\u201d. Deputy Opposition Leader Cameron Dick blamed the government for high inflation and said while the extra pay bump might help some, many people were struggling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDavid Crisafulli is delivering the highest state inflation in the country as his affordability crisis deepens, and it will cost the state\u2019s budget hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. While in government, Labor had argued its power bill rebates had helped ease inflation by reducing the electricity bill element of the official figures. In December, the state government revealed in its midyear budget update the state operating balance fell almost $400 million further into deficit.

It might not be in the form of a bill sent to your home, or a bite taken out of your payslip every fortnight, but nearly all of us are paying a big cost we shouldn\u2019t be. The problem is: it\u2019s not really visible unless you know about it. It\u2019s not too late to take inspiration from countries such as Norway, which has \u2013 largely through its taxing of resources \u2013 built up the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund. Matt Davidson You\u2019ve probably heard plenty about the need to tax resources companies more: not just for the pollution they pump into the atmosphere and damage they cause to the environment, but also because they\u2019re effectively making money out of digging up rocks, metals and gasses which don\u2019t belong to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there\u2019s an argument they don\u2019t really belong to any of us, except Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have looked after the land for centuries before colonisation. But as long as companies are continuing to mine resources, it makes sense for them to pay for the privilege \u2013 and to pay an amount that properly compensates for the damage caused by their businesses. It also makes sense for us to incentivise them to clean up their act. That\u2019s where the Superpower Institute (started by economist Professor Ross Garnaut and former competition watchdog head Rod Sims) kicks in. They may not have found a way to harness superpowers such as invisibility, but they (and experts Dr Ingrid Burford and Dr Reuben Finighan) have found a way to rein in the invisible villain that is greenhouse gas emissions. As their new report explains, between 2020 and 2023, Australia\u2019s state and federal governments took 30 per cent of fossil fuel companies\u2019 profits (mostly through a patchwork of corporate tax, royalties and the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat might seem like a decent chunk, but it\u2019s much less than the 75 to 90 per cent that other major fossil fuel exporting countries claw back, and not nearly enough to make up for the costs of pollution or to move us towards net zero fast enough. If we continue as we are, we\u2019ll struggle to fund essential services and to lift spending on education, new technologies and infrastructure: things we need to do if we\u2019re going to boost productivity. Meanwhile, as natural disasters become more frequent, our insurance costs are going up, and we\u2019re paying more at the checkout every time severe droughts or floods wipe out our farmers\u2019 harvests. It also comes at a time when the country needs a stronger budget to prepare for the bigger health and aged care bills that will come with an ageing population, to shield us from international shocks, and lift our living standards. Budget deficits are not always bad, but always having budget deficits is, and we\u2019re still a decade away from returning to surplus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we continue as we are, we\u2019ll struggle to fund essential services and to lift spending on education, new technologies and infrastructure: things we need to do if we\u2019re going to boost productivity (our ability to produce and do things better, faster or using fewer resources).

Right now, we rely on policies such as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d where the country\u2019s biggest industrial facilities are forced to limit their emissions (and, if they emit more than they\u2019re allowed to, to pay for emission-reducing projects by buying \u201ccarbon credits\u201d). There are several problems, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mechanism allows companies to buy their way out of actually reducing their own emissions, and often, the \u201ccredits\u201d they buy can be for projects that don\u2019t actually make as much difference as they claim, or projects which would have gone ahead anyway \u2013 and it fails to generate any government revenue. Instead, the first policy proposed by the Superpower Institute is a \u201cpolluter pays levy\u201d \u2013 or PPL \u2013 which would apply to coal, oil and gas extracted and consumed in Australia, and to fossil fuel imports including oil, petrol and diesel. For example, a company that mines and sells black coal would pay a levy for the methane released during their mining process and the carbon dioxide released when the coal is combusted to produce electricity. The levy would start this year at $17 for every tonne of CO2 \u2013 or equivalent amount of another greenhouse gas \u2013 rising gradually until it hits the European Union\u2019s carbon price in 2034, then continue tracking the EU carbon price. It would cover more than 80 per cent of Australia\u2019s emissions, would be more straightforward and difficult to game than current policies, and raise nearly $23 billion of revenue on average every year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s important because while Australians tend to support policies and actions to reduce emissions, we\u2019re sensitive to cost-of-living pressures such as energy bills. Most of us want to do the right thing, but when it costs us more, we might think twice. The revenue from the levy would partly be used to reimburse households for higher energy costs \u2013 even generating enough to over-compensate them. Whether $330 a year, as proposed by the institute, is enough for households to feel they are better off is up for some debate. But if polling is anything to go by, it\u2019s a policy that has a decent amount of public support. More than 60 per cent in a survey of 3000 voters (conducted by Redbridge Research for the Superpower Institute) agreed or strongly agreed with a polluter-pays levy. Overall, the institute reckons compensation for households would cost about $4.1 billion a year on average: less than one quarter of the revenue raised from the levy. Small businesses would also receive $325 a year, and compensation for households could be more targeted, starting at $490 a year for the bottom 75 per cent of households by income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe levy would also crucially help reduce Australia\u2019s annual carbon emissions by about 2.3 times more than under current policies according to the research. Related Article Opinion\n\nAI Robots, redundancies and runaway spending: Not all AI hits the mark Elizabeth Knight Business columnist The institute also suggests a \u201cfair share levy\u201d on gas exports, mirroring the system Norwegians have in place. The existing Petroleum Resources Rent Tax, introduced in the 1980s, doesn\u2019t work very well, especially for Australia\u2019s liquefied natural gas industry. Why? In short: because gas projects usually take decades (and a lot more money) to build than oil projects. Gas extracting companies can deduct these building costs (which they can carry across from one year to the next, and which can balloon every year to account for interest and inflation), effectively leaving them tax-free \u2013 sometimes forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the fair share levy, which would collect 40 per cent of the large profits that gas companies pocket over time, would be based on expenses and revenues companies face within the year. The government would take a fixed share of profits or losses each year, with a tax refund given to companies in a loss-making year. Since profits from the Australian oil and gas industry overwhelmingly flow to foreign shareholders, taxing these profits means Australians will be better off, with the annual benefit \u2013 at its peak \u2013 being about $1500 for every Australian household. The tax revenue generated from the two levies \u2013 averaging nearly $36 billion each year \u2013 could be used not only to compensate households and get the budget in better shape to fund essential services, but to invest in green industries where Australia has a competitive edge over many other countries. While we can\u2019t claw back the resources, emissions or money we\u2019ve let float by us, it\u2019s not too late to take inspiration from countries such as Norway, which has \u2013 largely through its taxing of resources \u2013 built up the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund. Perhaps most crucially, if we act now, we can set ourselves up to be a superpower in the global green transition.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe federal government has launched a spirited defence before the international community of its efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef, in its latest bid to avoid the reef being listed as \u201cin danger\u201d. In 2021 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) issued a draft recommendation that the Great Barrier Reef should be listed as an \u201cin danger\u201d World Heritage site. Bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef. AP Since then Australia has been locked in a multi-year battle to prevent that listing taking effect, a listing it says could place thousands of jobs at risk, particularly in tourism. Last year UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Committee ordered a full review of Australia\u2019s management of the Great Barrier Reef, following the sixth mass bleaching event in nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe body identified four areas of concern: climate pollution, water quality, climate-driven disasters like mass bleaching, and fisheries management. The government estimates the Great Barrier Reef contributes more than $9 billion a year to the Australian economy and, as the nation\u2019s fifth-biggest employer, supports 77,000 jobs. Coral scientists capture larvae during this year\u2019s annual coral spawning on the Great Barrier Reef. The Reef Co-Operative \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Great Barrier Reef is under extreme pressure from a range of factors like climate change, crown-of-thorns starfish, again, still issues around sediment run-off and reef water quality,\u201d Environment Minister Murray Watt told ABC radio on Friday morning. \u201cBut what we can also say is that the actions that both levels of government, along with the broader community, are taking are making the reef more resilient towards those changes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to UNESCO, the government on Friday released a state party report on the steps it has undertaken to protect the reef\u2019s ecosystems, in a bid to maintain the reef\u2019s listing of Outstanding Universal Value. The report emphasised the significant amendments to federal environment laws, passed with the support of the Greens last year, as a key measure that would help protect the reef. It also highlighted the government\u2019s decision to increase Australia\u2019s emissions reduction targets and reduce land-clearing within 50 metres of a watercourse, wetland or drainage line in the reef catchment area. The Great Barrier Reef is under threat. iStock The federal government has spent $1.2 billion to help build the reef\u2019s resilience and says its total investment \u2013 in partnership with the Queensland government \u2013 is more than $5 billion since 2014. Watt said the reef was one of the best-managed reef systems in the world and that Australia had not just met every commitment it has made to protect the reef but gone further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Australia votes Great Barrier Reef bleaching turns up heat in key Coalition seat The Australian Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Great Barrier Reef campaign manager Dr Lissa Schindler said the government had taken positive steps to improve the reef\u2019s health but had not gone far enough. \u201cYes, they are pushing forward with renewable energy projects, but they\u2019re also pushing forward with fossil fuel projects, and fossil fuels, like oil and coal and gas, is what is actually driving climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s climate target is not in line with 1.5 degrees [of warming], which is what is needed for coral reefs to survive.\u201d When UNESCO first signalled its intention to delist the reef of its Outstanding Universal Value status in 2021, the then-Morrison government acknowledged that climate change was the single greatest threat to its survival but insisted that only global action to reduce emissions would have any meaningful impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt noted that Australia\u2019s emissions comprised just 1.3 per cent of the global total and said that \u201cAustralia\u2019s efforts to reduce its own emissions would have virtually no impact on the long-term health and resilience of the reef\u201d. The Albanese government has sought to emphasise Australia\u2019s stronger emissions reductions commitments under Labor. Under the Paris Agreement, Australia has set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 62-70 per cent below 2005 levels by 2035 \u2013 a measure Watt described as \u201cambitious and achievable\u201d. The federal government has also argued the Great Barrier Reef is not alone in experiencing mass bleaching events, which have affected coral reefs worldwide as climate change drives ocean temperatures up. In a letter to UNESCO World Heritage Centre director Lazare Eloundou Assomo, Watt pointed out the 2023-2024 bleaching event had also affected more than 84 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs in more than 80 other countries and territories. \u201cIn submitting this report, I want to strongly reiterate that Australia\u2019s management of the [Great Barrier] Reef is recognised as world-leading and our impactful and adaptive actions remain integral to protecting this World Heritage property\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value into the future,\u201d Watt wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAustralia continues to act on its commitments under the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change and remains willing to lend our substantial expertise to other countries with climate-affected World Heritage sites.\u201d The World Heritage Committee will consider Australia\u2019s response at a session to be held in July. If it deems Australia\u2019s response is insufficient, it will then consider listing the reef as \u201cWorld Heritage In Danger\u201d.

By then, Haas will be 28 and, if the proposed R360 rugby competition gets off the ground, he could be tempted by riches beyond anything available in the NRL. Alternatively, he could be precisely the type of marquee signing the Perth Bears will come chasing. Brisbane will want to retain Payne Haas beyond the 2026 season. Credit: Getty Images The Broncos would no doubt love to re-sign Haas to a long-term deal. The ageing legs of halves Ben Hunt and Adam Reynolds don\u2019t have many more tomorrows left. Haas, on the other hand, is a franchise player, at the top of his game.\n\nKey gains: Aublix Tawha (Dolphins), Grant Anderson (Storm), Tom Duffy (Cowboys).\n\nKey losses: Selwyn Cobbo (Dolphins), Kobe Hetherington (Sea Eagles), Tyson Smoothy (Wakefield)\n\nComing off contract: Adam Reynolds, Ben Hunt, Gehamat Shibasaki, Billy Walters, Jack Gosiewski, Payne Haas, Cory Paix, Jesse Arthars. Storm (runners-up) Harry Grant comes to terms with another grand final loss. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story? First Ryan Papenhuyzen and Nelson Asofa-Solomona announced they were taking sabbaticals. Next Eliesa Katoa suffered a horrific concussion playing for Tonga that will sideline him for 2026 at least, and then the Perth Bears swooped to sign Nick Meaney and Tyran Wishart for their 2027 foundation season.\n\nAll this, on top of losing back-to-back grand finals, does not augur well, but the Melbourne Storm are no ordinary team. Nonetheless, it shapes as a bit of a rebuilding operation, and nobody is better qualified to oversee the process than Craig Bellamy, arguably the greatest coach in the game. Of course, the big question remains: how long will 66-year-old Bellamy continue? He has been quite content to sign one-year extensions, while hinting retirement is not far away. Players are replaceable, but Melbourne must be dreading the day \u201cBellyache\u201d informs them he\u2019s pulling the pin. They\u2019ll be hoping his era continues beyond this season. Key gains: Jack Hetherington (Knights), Davvy Moale (Rabbitohs), Manaia Waitere (Raiders)\n\nKey losses: Ryan Papenhuyzen, Nelson Asofa-Solomona (both released), Jonah Pezet (Eels), Grant Anderson (Broncos)\n\nComing off contract: Will Warbrick, Shawn Blore, Jack Hetherington, Tui Kamikamica.\n\nPanthers (preliminary final) It\u2019s back to square one for Penrith after Brisbane ended their dynasty in last year\u2019s preliminary final. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Compared to the spotlight they commanded during their four-year reign as champions, the Panthers have spent the off-season flying under the radar, which no doubt suits coach Ivan Cleary just fine. Rival teams, however, are entitled to be nervous: how hungry will the deposed champions be after surrendering their title?\n\nComplacency can bring even the greatest of teams undone, once they\u2019ve been there, won that, on multiple occasions. Do they have the willpower to get back up there? Nathan Cleary, the ultimate competitor and perfectionist, will surely relish the challenge. Beware the Panthers. They\u2019re not done yet. Key gains: Jack Cogger (Knights), Tom Ale (Warriors), Freddy Lussick (Warriors)\n\nKey losses: Brad Schneider (Dolphins), Daine Laurie (Raiders), Mavrik Geyer (Tigers), Trent Toelau (Storm), Soni Luke (Cowboys)\n\nComing off contract: Scott Sorensen, Luke Garner, Lindsay Smith, Matt Eisenhuth, Tom Ale. Sharks (preliminary final)\n\nThe Sharks were furious with the performance of referee Ashley Klein in last year\u2019s preliminary final. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Shark Park was a hive of activity last week, on and off the field. As Cronulla\u2019s players completed a gruelling training session under the eye of coach Fitzgibbon, tradesmen were just as hard at work in the adjoining building site. It is hoped they will have completed the fit-out of the leagues club redevelopment by mid-to-late 2026, allowing the Sharks to reopen for the first time in six years, after myriad construction delays.\n\nThey\u2019ll be hoping it improves their financial position to the point where they can apply for government funding for a centre of excellence, which would put them on level footing with their Sydney-based NRL rivals. Meanwhile, Fitzgibbon and his very settled squad are not satisfied with back-to-back appearances in preliminary finals. Old-school training facilities might yet provide the steely edge that helps them claim the ultimate prize. Key gains: None\n\nKey losses: Daniel Atkinson (Dragons), Kade Dykes (Bulldogs)\n\nComing off contract: Cam McInnes, Siosifa Talakai, Sione Katoa, Jesse Ramien, Sam Stonestreet, Toby Rudolf, Will Kennedy, Braden Hamlin-Uele, Billy Burns. Raiders (semi-finalists) The Canberra Raiders won the minor premiership but lost both play-offs. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? Coach Ricky Stuart is set to give 22-year-old Ethan Sanders first shot at steering the Raiders after the departure of halfback Jamal Fogarty. Stuart has plenty of faith in Sanders, who has played four NRL matches across the past two seasons with the Raiders and Eels. Sanders is also a handy goalkicker, which could make him a like-for-like replacement for Fogarty, now at Manly. And he\u2019ll have the perfect mentor in Stuart, one of the greatest halfbacks of all time.\n\nStuart guided the Green Machine to the minor premiership last season, but heartbreak followed when they bowed out of the finals with back-to-back defeats. They\u2019ll be primed to give a better account of themselves this year at the business end of proceedings. Key gains: Jayden Brailey (Knights), Daine Laurie (Panthers), Coby Black (Broncos), Sione Finau (Dragons)\n\nKey losses: Jamal Fogarty (Sea Eagles), Trey Mooney (Knights), Pasami Saulo (Knights), Danny Levi (Leeds)\n\nComing off contract: Josh Papali\u2019i, Morgan Smithies, Chevy Stewart Bulldogs (semi-finalists) The Bulldogs contemplate their season-ending defeat against the Panthers. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story?\n\nAs the first major signing of Canterbury\u2019s rebuild, Matt Burton has been both a catalyst for change and a cornerstone of their success the past two seasons. Burton\u2019s form last year was as good as ever, yet there is already speculation that he will be squeezed out at the end of this season, despite being contracted until the end of 2027. The theory goes that the Bulldogs want Lachlan Galvin to play five-eighth, his natural position, and they have a promising young half waiting in the wings called Mitchell Woods. Whether Burton is the odd man out remains to be seen, but if he wants to win a premiership with Canterbury \u2013 to add to the one he collected at Penrith \u2013 there\u2019s no time like the present. After finishing third last season before exiting the finals in straight sets, the Bulldogs will be hoping former Knights prop Leo Thompson can give them a new dimension.\n\nKey gains: Leo Thompson (Knights), Kade Dykes (Sharks), Sean O\u2019Sullivan (Dolphins), Fletcher Baker (Broncos)\n\nKey losses: Reed Mahoney (Cowboys), Toby Sexton (Catalans), Blake Wilson (Sea Eagles)\n\nComing off contract: Connor Tracey, Daniel Suluka-Fifita, Jake Turpin, Kurt Mann, Marcelo Montoya. Warriors (finalists) Luke Metcalf was leading the 2025 Dally M count before he suffered a season-ending knee injury in June. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Coach Andrew Webster will be sweating on the return of co-captain Mitch Barnett and halfback Luke Metcalf from season-ending knee reconstructions.\n\nBefore the loss of NSW and Kangaroos forward Barnett last June, the Warriors had won nine of their first 12 games and were sitting second on the ladder. Metcalf, who was leading the Dally M voting, was sidelined soon after, and Webster\u2019s men eventually limped home in sixth position, before being bundled out by Penrith in week one of the play-offs. Barnett hopes to launch his comeback inside the first few rounds. Metcalf is aiming for round seven. The Warriors are expecting big things from new signing Alofiana Khan-Pereira, who was a prolific try-scorer at the Gold Coast. And Barnett has also tipped English forward Morgan Gannon to make an immediate impact. Main gains: Alofiana Khan-Pereira (Titans), Morgan Gannon (Leeds)\n\nMain losses: Bunty Afoa (Tigers), Freddy Lussick (Panthers), Tom Ale (Panthers)\n\nComing off contract: Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, Kurt Capewell, Marata Niukore, Chanel Harris-Tavita, Rocco Berry, Te Maire Martin, Tanah Boyd.\n\nRoosters (finalists) Roosters skipper James Tedesco and new recruit Daly Cherry-Evans. Credit: Peter Rae What\u2019s the story? Can Daly Cherry-Evans emulate Cooper Cronk and become a premiership-winning talisman with the Roosters? The former Manly skipper might be the oldest player in the NRL, turning 37 before the season kicks off, but he is likely to turn the Chooks into contenders again. The DCE coup has commanded so much attention it is easy to forget the Roosters have also signed the incumbent NSW hooker, Reece Robson, from the Cowboys.\n\nAdding further depth to an imposing squad, Tommy Talau (Manly) and Cody Ramsey (St George Illawarra) are waiting in the wings, in case Trent Robinson loses any of his outside backs to injury. On the flip side, Kangaroos stars Angus Crichton and Mark Nawaqanitawase will switch codes at season\u2019s end, in the hope of winning a World Cup with the Wallabies. They will no doubt have their hearts set on a grand final lap of honour before clocking off. Key gains: Daly Cherry-Evans (Sea Eagles), Reece Robson (Cowboys), Tommy Talau (Sea Eagles), Cody Ramsey (Dragons)\n\nKey losses: Sandon Smith (Knights), Zach Dockar-Clay (Sea Eagles)\n\nComing off contract: Daly Cherry-Evans, Daniel Tupou, Siua Wong, Tommy Talau.

They came within one win of a maiden finals berth last season, and now the Dolphins will be bolstered by an influx of quality reinforcements. Former Queensland and Kangaroos prop Thomas Flegler, who hasn\u2019t played for almost two years after suffering career-threatening nerve damage in his shoulder, will return. Tom Gilbert (pectoral), Daniel Saifiti (shoulder), Max Plath (knee) and Jack Bostock (knee) won\u2019t be too far behind him. Throw in English import Morgan Knowles \u2013 a four-time Super League winner with St Helens \u2013 and the Dolphins should have some serious muscle in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, after scoring 721 points last season \u2013 the most by any team during the regular season \u2013 the Dolphins have added explosive Selwyn Cobbo to their backline. In Cobbo and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, Dolphins coach Kristian Woolf will have two strike weapons capable of scoring from anywhere. Key gains: Selwyn Cobbo (Broncos), Morgan Knowles (St Helens), Brad Schneider (Panthers)\n\nKey losses: Josh Kerr (Dragons), Mark Nicholls, Kenny Bromwich (both retired), Max Feagai (Titans), Aublix Tawha (Broncos), Sean O\u2019Sullivan (Bulldogs)\n\nComing off contract: Selwyn Cobbo, Jamayne Isaako, Brad Schneider, Jake Averillo, Francis Molo, Ray Stone, Trai Fuller, Kodi Nikorima. Manly Sea Eagles (10th) Manly players after their scrimmage with St George Illawarra last week. Credit: Max Mason-Hubers\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? For the first time since he debuted in 2011 \u2013 the last time Manly won a premiership \u2013 the Sea Eagles head into a season without Daly Cherry-Evans in their No.7 jersey. But after signing former Canberra playmaker Jamal Fogarty, Manly coach Anthony Seibold will be hoping the transition is seamless. The Sea Eagles finished two points outside the top eight last year, but they were cruelled by season-ending injuries to big men Taniela Paseka and Haumole Olakau\u2019atu, and Jake Trbojevic\u2019s concussion. As always, much will depend on Tom Trbojevic, who will lead the new era after succeeding Cherry-Evans as skipper and return to his preferred fullback role. His fitness and form will be crucial to Manly\u2019s finals hopes, and in turn to Seibold\u2019s job security.\n\nThe Sea Eagles have reached the play-offs just once during Seibold\u2019s three seasons. He is contracted until the end of 2027, but needs a breakout season to keep the wolves from the door. Key gains: Jamal Fogarty (Raiders), Kobe Hetherington (Broncos), Zach Docker-Clay (Roosters)\n\nKey losses: Daly Cherry-Evans (Roosters), Tommy Talau (Roosters), Matt Lodge (Cowboys), Toafofoa Sipley (Warrington), Josh Aloiai, Lachlan Croker (both retired), Jazz Tevaga (Wakefield)\n\nComing off contract: Jake Trbojevic, Tolutau Koula, Siosiua Taukeiaho. Parramatta Eels (11th) The Eels and former winger Zac Lomax are set for a legal battle. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story?\n\nWhat, or who, will the Eels receive in exchange for Zac Lomax? That is the main narrative surrounding Parramatta after the protracted contractual impasse that prompted the club to launch legal action last week against the representative winger, to ensure he doesn\u2019t join a rival NRL team without their permission. The Eels agreed to release Lomax from his contract, believing he would head to rugby union. Instead, he wants to join the Melbourne Storm, who haven\u2019t overwhelmed the Eels with whatever they have offered in terms of financial compensation or a possible player exchange. Whatever transpires with Lomax, you can guarantee Eels coach Jason Ryles, an unflappable type, is getting on with business after delivering 10 wins in his rookie year as head coach in 2026. If Parramatta\u2019s improvement continues, their first finals appearance since 2022 appears a realistic outcome.\n\nKey gains: Jonah Pezet (Storm), Jack de Belin (Dragons), Brian Kelly (Titans)\n\nKey losses: Dylan Brown (Knights), Zac Lomax (released), Shaun Lane (retired), Brendan Hands (Toulouse), Dean Hawkins (London Broncos)\n\nComing off contract: Junior Paulo, Will Penisini, Dylan Walker, Joash Papalii, Kelma Tuilagi, Ryan Matterson North Queensland Cowboys (12th) Cowboys coach Todd Payten with veteran Jason Taumalolo. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story? Cowboys coach Todd Payten is unlikely to lose any sleep over constant speculation that he\u2019s a dead man walking if North Queensland cannot reach the finals in 2026.\n\nPayten is heading into his fifth season as North Queensland\u2019s tactician, and has made the finals in two of his previous four attempts. He has a 50 per cent winning record, which is second only to the late Paul Green, the sole coach to have steered the Cowboys to a premiership. Nonetheless, Payten is off contract at the end of this season, and the NRL is a ruthless industry, so nobody will need to remind him what is at stake. Any disappointment the Cowboys felt when NSW Origin hooker Reece Robson signed with the Roosters was offset by their recruitment of feisty Reed Mahoney from the Bulldogs. A favourable draw in the early rounds could potentially alleviate the pressure on Payten, providing the Cowboys can capitalise. Key gains: Reed Mahoney (Bulldogs), Matt Lodge (Sea Eagles), Soni Luke (Panthers)\n\nKey losses: Reece Robson (Roosters), Jordan McLean (retired), Karl Lawton (Hull KR)\n\nComing off contract: Murray Taulagi, Jake Clifford, Jaxon Purdue, Braidon Burns, John Bateman, Matt Lodge, Sam McIntyre.\n\nWests Tigers (13th) Wests Tigers fans have been waiting since 2011 to cheer for their team in the finals. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Regardless of the boardroom brawling late last year, culminating in the departure of chief executive Shane Richardson, the Wests Tigers players will be eager to continue their on-field improvement under coach Benji Marshall. Recruits Kai Pearce-Paul, the England and former Newcastle back-rower, and ex-Warriors prop Bunty Afoa should ensure the Tigers are more capable of throwing their weight around this season as they seek their first finals appearance since 2011.\n\nMarshall steered them to nine wins and 13th spot last season, a vast improvement on three consecutive wooden spoons. With Lachlan Galvin gone, the Tigers have a more settled look about them. Jarome Luai, Adam Doueihi, Api Koroisau and Jahream Bula are evolving into a quality spine, and irrespective of any boardroom shenanigans, Tigers fans are entitled to be optimistic their team can challenge for a play-off berth. Key gains: Kai Pearce-Paul (Knights), Bunty Afoa (Warriors), Mavrik Geyer (Panthers), Jock Madden (Broncos)\n\nKey losses: Charlie Staines (Catalans), Brent Naden (released)\n\nComing off contract: Jarome Luai, Jahream Bula, Jack Bird, Sione Fainu, Jeral Skelton, Mavrik Geyer, Tony Sukkar.

Coach Wayne Bennett has been a driving force behind a proposed rule change, whereby teams that concede a try will be given the option of either receiving the ball from the restart, or kicking off themselves. There is plenty of opposition among rival coaches and fans to the \u201cscorer\u2019s kick-off\u201d plan, but by all accounts ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys is inclined to back Bennett. \u201cStop whingeing about it \u2026 if you listen to some of these guys [complaining], we\u2019d still be playing with unlimited tackles, and players would still be wearing black boots with white laces,\u201d was Bennett\u2019s response to the resistance. Regardless, Bennett faces a huge challenge at Souths. Last season was the worst result of his illustrious career, considering the Rabbitohs\u2019 final placing (14th) and win tally (nine). He hasn\u2019t had a team in the finals since 2021, and he hasn\u2019t won a premiership since 2011.\n\nHe\u2019s banking on enigmas like Latrell Mitchell, David Fifita and Brandon Smith to play consistently and avoid injuries, and for Cody Walker to keep defying Father Time. Key gains: David Fifita (Titans), Adam Elliott (Knights), Bronson Garlick (Storm), Jonah Glover (Dragons)\n\nKey losses: Davvy Moale (Storm), Lewis Dodd (Catalans), Mikaele Ravalawa (Castleford), Jacob Host (released), Siliva Havili (London), Shaquai Mitchell (released)\n\nComing off contract: Cody Walker, Jamie Humphreys, Sean Keppie, Adam Elliott, Liam Le Blanc Dragons (15th) The Dragons haven\u2019t featured in the NRL finals since 2018. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story?\n\nWill Shane Flanagan have to drop his own son? The Dragons coach has never been known to shy away from a tough call, and the arrival of Daniel Atkinson from Cronulla ensures Kyle Flanagan is no sure thing to retain the No.7 jersey he wore in 24 games last season. Flanagan could find himself shifting to five-eighth, or potentially out of the starting side altogether. The Dragons received a massive boost before Christmas when they signed Keaon Koloamatangi from Souths. A helicopter tour of the Illawarra apparently sealed the deal, but the Kangaroos forward won\u2019t arrive until 2027. In the interim, the Red V have to figure out how to win tight games. They suffered eight losses last year by six points or fewer. They\u2019ll need to kick that habit to have any hope of reaching the finals for the first time since 2018.\n\nKey gains: Daniel Atkinson (Sharks), Josh Kerr (Dolphins), Setu Tu (Warriors)\n\nKey losses: Jack de Belin (Eels), Lachlan Ilias (Titans), David Klemmer (St Helens), Cody Ramsey (Roosters)\n\nComing off contract: Damien Cook, Tyrell Sloan, Jaydn Su\u2019A, Emre Guler, Luciano Leilua, Blake Lawrie, Christian Tuipulotu. Titans (16th) A new era kicks off for the Titans under rookie coach Josh Hannay Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Big Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui is one of the game\u2019s genuine warriors, and the Titans desperately need some early season success to have any hope of keeping the poachers at bay.\n\nThe Titans produced a great escape to avoid the 2025 wooden spoon, but rookie coach Josh Hannay might not be so fortunate in his debut season. Gold Coast appear to have cleared the deck for a spending spree, although it will require a leap of faith for Fa\u2019asuamaleaui to extend his stay. Hannay can only hope his new-look team, with Lachlan Ilias calling the shots at halfback, can offer their captain a glimmer of hope that they are on the right trajectory. Given their roster, that will surely be easier said than done. Key gains: Lachlan Ilias (Dragons), Max Feagai (Dolphins), Luke Sommerton (Panthers), Kurtis Morrin (Bulldogs)\n\nKey losses: David Fifita (Rabbitohs), Kieran Foran (retired), Reagan Campbell-Gillard (London), Carter Gordon (released), Alofiana Khan-Pereira (Warriors), Brian Kelly (Eels)\n\nComing off contract: Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, Phillip Sami, Sam Verrills, Jaimin Joliffe.\n\nKnights (17th) Newcastle are hoping to offload the wooden spoon this season. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? They\u2019re set to field a potentially lethal backline, having spent a fortune on former Eels five-eighth Dylan Brown, whose job will be to unlock the likes of Kalyn Ponga, Bradman Best, Dominic Young, Fletcher Sharpe and Dane Gagai. But before the Ferraris can show their class, they\u2019ll need a platform up front, and therein lies the problem for new coach Justin Holbrook in his first season at the helm of the incumbent wooden spooners.",

I made a very clear commitment that existing participants would stay on the program subject to all the usual rules. But state and territories in the Commonwealth agreed way back in 2023 that far too many young children were ending up on the NDIS. In some parts of the country, as many as one in four young boys were ending up on a scheme that was established for severe and permanent disability.\"\n\n---\n\nOlder Australians are waiting an average of eight months to get access to home support services, which includes showering, meal preparation and cleaning.\n\nThe data in the Productivity Commission's Report on Government Services represents almost a doubling in the median wait time over the last financial year.\n\nA spokesman for Aged Care Minister Sam Rae says the report includes data that predates the government\u2019s aged care reforms, including a new single assessment system which came in at the start of 2025.\n\nThe spokesperson says action is being taken to reduce wait times.\n\nThe federal government announced the release of 20,000 home care packages late last year, and another 63,000 by the middle of this year .\n\nOverall, Australia spent nearly $40 billion on aged care in the 2024/25 financial year, up from $38 billion the previous year.\n\n---\n\nUS border chief Tom Homan says federal agents will focus on targeted operations, shifting away from broad street sweeps that have provoked outrage in America and abroad.\n\nMr Homan admitted the federal immigration agency ICE could \"do better\" - in a rare acknowledgment from the administration that their operations had not been perfect.\n\nThis follows the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents in the past month.\n\nMr Homan adds he would reduce the 3000-strong force of agents deployed to the city if he received cooperation from state and local leaders.\n\nMayor Frey continues to vocalise strong opposition to the enforcement, saying this kind of conduct needs to stop.\n\n\"What's become clear to me is this is obviously not about safety. This is not even about immigration. This is about silencing a narrative or a political position that differs from that of a federal administration. We've seen this kind of conduct in other countries. We cannot see it right here in America.\"\n\n---\n\nIn Tennis, world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka has welcomed the possibility of Serena Williams' return to the sport.\n\nThe 23-time grand slam singles champion did not rule out a potential comeback when interviewed on the NBC's Today Show.\n\nSerena Williams: I am just having fun and enjoying me life right now.\n\nInterviewer: Okay, but that's not a yes or a no.\n\nSerena Williams: That is not a yes or a no. I don't know. I'm going to see what happens. I have two kids. When I filled out the form the other day - occupation? I put down housewife. Listen, I can't discuss this.

        "text": "The federal government announced plans this week to reform how medications are dispensed and tracked, aiming to reduce unsafe use, stockpiling and \"doctor shopping\".\n\nThis will include two stages. First, the government will require all online and telehealth prescribers to upload information about a patient's prescribed medications to their My Health Record.\n\nSecond, the government plans to develop a National Medicines Record \u2013 an overarching database to register and monitor all current prescriptions.\n\nSo, how would this work? While some detail is still lacking, here's what we know.\n\nWhy is this needed?\n\nAn increasing number of Australians take multiple medications. Recent research analysing prescribing patterns in Australia estimates almost two million of us took five or more regular medicines in 2024.\n\nWhile multiple medicines are often needed to manage multiple conditions, there are risks of adverse effects.\n\nAnd when a clinician prescribes medication or a pharmacist dispenses it without a full understanding of the patient's current medications, it can lead to harmful interactions between them.\n\nThis can make a patient sicker and often lands them in hospital. An estimated 1.5 million people in Australia experience some kind of harmful side effect from using medicine each year.\n\nThose at particular risk are older adults taking numerous medications, as well as those transitioning between health-care settings (such as going into hospital or returning home).\n\nSometimes patients also stockpile medications, including through consulting multiple doctors, known as \"doctor shopping'. For example, they might do this to obtain extra supplies of addictive pain medication.\n\nHow does it work right now?\n\nCurrently, there is no centralised, mandatory register that records all of the medicines a person is prescribed and dispensed.\n\nInstead, prescribing information may be siloed in hospital and aged care systems, general practice records and those of online telehealth providers such as Instant Scripts, 13SICK and Hola Health.\n\nThis can prevent any single doctor or pharmacist from having clear, comprehensive information about a patient's medications.\n\nSome healthcare practitioners and pharmacy bodies have criticised the online prescribing industry, in particular, for contributing to inappropriate prescribing and medication misuse.\n\nFor high-risk medications such as opioids, there is already a Real Time Prescription Monitoring system. Victoria has a similar system called SafeScript, but this doesn't record the full range of prescription medications.\n\nAnnouncing the reforms on Wednesday, Health Minister Mark Butler referred to an Australian woman who died from an overdose after stockpiling her medicine. He explained her parents' advocacy prompted the government to address the lack of a comprehensive medicines record.\n\nWhat will change?\n\nFirst, the government will require online and telehealth prescribing platforms to add information to the My Health Record system about prescribed medications. This will include information about the clinical reasoning for prescribing.\n\nMy Health Record is a government-run platform providing a secure, online collection of a patient\u2019s health information. Both patients and their treating health-care professionals can access it.\n\nSo any medication or related clinical information uploaded by a prescriber would be accessible via My Health Record, to the patient as well as to their health-care providers and pharmacists.\n\nMany general practices already upload this information, but online prescribing platforms may not. Organisations representing pharmacists have long called for this kind of change.\n\nLISTEN TO Medical specialists welcome study debunking paracetamol autism claims SBS News 00:49 English\n\nWill it work?\n\nIn theory, it is a step forward. The challenge is that the My Health Record system remains underused. One in 10 Australians have no My Health Record (the system is opt-out).\n\nFor the millions of Australians who do have a My Health Record, usage is increasing. But many still have never accessed their own record.\n\nIt is also not clear whether, and how, a patient\u2019s access to their own My Health Record would reduce medication harm (particularly if the patient is deliberately stockpiling medication).\n\nAlmost all GPs, pharmacies and public hospitals are registered for My Health Record and have used the system. But data shows pharmacies are mainly using it to upload information rather than looking at records others have uploaded.\n\nOverall, ensuring that all medicines information is available on the My Health Record is a positive step.\n\nBut it does not mean that the information will be accessed (or understood) by others who are prescribing and dispensing medication to a patient.\n\nThe warnings that were placed by hospital services on the My Health Record of the young woman who died from an overdose were not accessed by telehealth services nor pharmacies prescribing and supplying her with medication.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAs a second step, the government says it will design and build a National Medicines Record. This would be an overarching platform linked to My Health Record and other digital health systems, to register all current prescriptions.\n\nAt this stage, detail is lacking, but healthcare practitioners and pharmacy bodies are broadly supportive.\n\nA consultation is underway.\n\nIf this article has raised issues for you, or if you\u2019re concerned about someone you know, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.\n\nMegan Prictor is a member of the Australasian Association of Bioethics and Health Law, the European Association for Health Law and the World Association of Medical Law.",

        "text": "Gold and silver have notched a string of fresh record highs in recent sessions as global uncertainty drivers investors towards safe havens.\n\nLocal gold and silver prices are currently around $7,610 and $166 an ounce respectively \u2014 a far cry from the $5,100 and $58 they were priced at six months ago.\n\nThe rally has drawn increased interest from small investors. The Perth Mint experienced a surge in customers seeking to buy bullion or sell their jewellery in October. And more recently, there have been reports of people queuing at bullion dealers in Sydney's CBD.\n\nBut with prices surging, is it too late to invest? And what might you need to weigh up if you're considering it?\n\nWhat to be aware of\n\nPrice rallies can be alluring, but investing carries inherent risks. The federal government's MoneySmart offers guidance on what to consider and also recommends speaking to a financial adviser before you invest.\n\nWhen it comes to gold, Ole Hansen, head of commodity at Danish Investment Bank Saxo Bank, said the drivers behind the rally are \"largely concern-driven\".\n\n\"Geopolitical uncertainty remains elevated, amplified by an increasingly unpredictable US political backdrop, and inflation concerns have proven stickier than many policymakers had hoped,\" Hansen said in a statement this week.\n\nHe said demand for safe-haven assets like gold might start to cool, but does not believe a \"major\" price correction is on the horizon.\n\nDaniel Hynes, a senior commodity strategist for ANZ, echoed similar price drivers, and also believes there is likely to be a \"pullback in value in the not-too-distant future\".\n\n\"But the drivers that we have seen pushing [gold and silver] to these levels are not going to disappear soon,\" Hynes said.\n\nLISTEN TO Is it too late to jump on the gold and silver bullet train? SBS News 20:41 English\n\nSilver, he said, has \"the best of both worlds\", with an industrial link as well as being a safe-haven asset.\n\n\"When silver was included on the US critical minerals list just recently, that has raised some concerns that the US will start to strategically stockpile and potentially put tariffs on the metal as well,\" Hynes said.\n\nSilver also has uses in artificial technologies and the solar industry, he added.\n\nMichael Wayne, managing director at Medallion Financial Group, is more cautious. He said when there was a precious metals boom in 2011, the heat \"came out of it just as quickly as it went in\".\n\n\"Investors rushing to the party now need to be very, very careful and tread carefully,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very rare that you get a situation where the most dominant sector of the previous year continues to be the dominant sector for the year going forward.\"\n\nWhile Hansen believes gold won't experience a major price correction, he does have concerns for silver and believes it is in \"bubble territory\".\n\n\"While gold's ascent has so far been relatively orderly, with little evidence of classic bubble behaviour, the same cannot be said for silver,\" he said.\n\n\"Silver increasingly show signs of having moved into bubble territory, with retail participation, speculative positioning and fear of missing out acting as the primary drivers of a rally that has pushed prices to historically expensive levels, both relative to gold and to platinum.\n\nIn a December forecast of the price of gold for 2026, Natasha Kaneva, head of global commodities strategy at US investment bank JP Morgan, predicted further increases but said the rally \"has not, and will not, be linear\".\n\nHow can you invest?\n\nPeter Swan, a professor of finance at the University of NSW Business School, told SBS News that the cost of investing in gold and silver, like any commodity, is based on supply and demand.\n\n\"They all exist on a spectrum and have different proportions of cash or earnings in returns. Shares have a dividend yield of around 4 or 5 per cent, while investing in housing gives a lower yield of around 2 per cent,\" he said.\n\nPeople can invest in precious metals in a range of ways. This includes buying the physical commodity in the form of bullion, coins or jewellery.\n\nOther methods include buying shares in exchange-traded funds, where gold and silver are bought on behalf of shareholders, as well as directly buying shares in gold and silver mining companies.\n\nDisclaimer: The information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

So it's about a balance of trying to look after and do what's best and look after her.\"\n\nTreatment of blood cancers, including leukemia, can endure for years.\n\nChloe's nurse, Maddy Gilsenan, is a paediatric bone marrow transplant and cellular therapy nurse practitioner at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne.\n\nAt the hospital's cancer centre, she treats patients from newborns to teenagers and sees firsthand the impact of lengthy hospital stays.\n\n\"Particularly for our older children, our young adults and adolescents, when they're not out doing all the things that their peers are doing. They're missing out on school which is such a precious time for a child. So, a think it can be a really lonely experience for patients. And we do the best we can to look after them in our department, but it can be a really lonely time for a patient and their whole family.\"\n\nThe financial burden of childhood blood cancers on families is also intense and many families rely on support services.\n\nThe Rodger family had to grieve the life they lost after Chloe's diagnosis.\n\n\"My husband sold his business. I had to quit work. There was a huge toll on us. Talking about it and spreading awareness for other families going through this. We need support these families. It is a really critical and tough time, and I know a lot of families don't always make it after an illness like this. And we need more support in terms of kids for their education and families for their mental health.\"\n\nMany children frequently miss between 40 and 60 per cent of school in their first year of treatment, with some absent for six to 18 months or more.\n\nSince she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia at age 9 in 2022, Chloe has missed a total of around two years away from school - and at least 10 months of that time in hospital.\n\nIn that time, Melissa found a charity that offered remote tutoring to children in Chloe's situation.\n\n\"I think it would be great if all kids could get that extra support in terms of tutoring. There are school services offered in the hospital, which Chloe took up. It was more just a bit of fun - and getting this tutoring that she did made a huge impact.\"\n\nIt is the most common and life-threatening childhood cancer in Australia and based on the data, this year, 350 Australian children are expected to be newly diagnosed with blood cancer.\n\nOver the past 20 years, blood cancer incidence has increased by almost 30 per cent among children aged 5 to 14 years.\n\nThe Leukaemia Foundation says if that rate of diagnosis continues, more than 400 children will be diagnosed annually by the next decade.\n\nBill Stavreski is the head of research at the foundation.\n\nHe says more funding into blood cancers is needed, to support patients and their families - and to build on major advancements in treatments.\n\n\"The key focus at the moment, now is early detection and prevention. If we can identify and diagnose children and people with blood cancer earlier and then hopefully into the future be able to prevent and understand why children are being diagnosed with leukemia and lymphoma. And there are significant inroads being made, but we still don't have those key answers and the need for research is quite significant.\"\n\nThe Leukaemia Foundation is urging people to shave, cut, or colour their hair for the World\u2019s Greatest Shave.\n\nThe campaign is raising money for research and support services.\n\nMr Stavreski says a place to stay is one of the most important lifelines.\n\n\"Each year, the Leukemia Foundation provides 44,000 nights of accommodation for families and many of those patients are children who have to relocate. Some stay in our accommodation centres for up to six months. There is also the transport assistance, financial and importantly there is the emotional support from trained professionals.\"\n\nThere are other ways to help patients impacted by blood cancers.\n\nMany of the Australian children who will be diagnosed with a type of blood cancer this year will need stem cell therapy.\n\nThere aren't enough donors on shore, so 70 per cent of them will have to find overseas donors.\n\nYou can join the stem cell registry and become a potential donor when you next give blood.\n\nDonating whole blood and plasma is another important service eligible Australians can provide, to help blood cancer patients.\n\nMs Gilsenan says blood product donations are saving children's lives every day.\n\n\"We rely heavily on blood donations from the community. And we have a lot of children that will be requiring transfusion support potentially once a week or even more for up to two years. So, we use a big proportion of the blood supply that is kindly donated.\"\n\nYou can register for this year's World's Greatest Shave at worldsgreatestshave.com or call 1800 500 088.",

The remaining contacts, approximately 190-200 of them, have been quarantined and those who showed symptoms have also been tested. They also tested negative apart from these two patients, no one else has tested positive yet.\u201d\n\nNipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans, and can cause fever and brain inflammation.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says it has a fatality rate of between 40 per cent and 75 per cent, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management.\n\nDr Goswami says the confirmed cases in India is troubling, given there is no vaccine, or proven treatment options.\n\n\u201cThe Nipah virus infection is very dangerous. There are three reasons for this. First, there is no cure for it, there is no specific treatment and no medicine works. Secondly, there is no vaccine or inoculation for it. And the third thing is that its morbidity rate, the fatality ratio, is very high.\u201d\n\nInfectious diseases consultant at Manipal Hospital in India's West, Dr Sayan Chakraborty, says the danger of the virus lies in its potential to spread to the brain.\n\n\u201cIt starts like a normal viral fever. There is fever, headache, pain in the whole body. Along with it, there is pain in the throat and a cough. The cough transforms into Pneumonia-like conditions. There is difficulty in breathing. Then, gradually, the infection spreads to the brain which reduces the senses of the patient. Eventually, the patient goes into a coma.\u201d\n\nProfessor in Medicine at the Norwich Medical School, Paul Hunter, says once the virus has impacted the brain, symptoms quickly become severe.\n\n\"The thing that probably kills most is called encephalitis, which is an infection and a swelling of the brain. And when you get encephalitis, you start feeling very unwell. You have high fever, you have very severe headaches, and you can have photophobia, where the light hurts your eyes.\"\n\nMost people who survive encephalitis make a full recovery, but the W-H-O says approximately 20 per cent are left with residual neurological consequences such as seizure disorder and personality changes.\n\nNipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999.\n\nSince then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh, and India has experienced sporadic outbreaks.\n\nAccording to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a group that tracks emerging disease threats, as of December last year, 750 cases had been recorded since 1999, and 415 of the patients died.\n\nWhile the virus can spread from person to person, Professor Hunter says it does not do so easily, which may explain why outbreaks have usually been small and fairly contained.\n\n\"As far as we can tell, the main risk of person-to-person transmission comes from fairly close contact, you know, typically when you're caring for somebody who's quite ill. But it must be said there aren't a lot of, there's not a huge amount of evidence on which to base a lot of these judgements.\"\n\nWhen first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs.\n\nSince then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its primary host: fruit bats.\n\nThe WHO says the consumption of fruit or fruit products containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection.\n\nProfessor Hunter says with this in mind, there are some precautions that can help protect a person from contracting the virus.\n\n\"In terms of the initial infections, it's being careful about eating and drinking food that might be contaminated by fruit bats. For the traveller, if any of us go to these areas, the issue is, you know, being the sort of things that you're not supposed to do anyway, or you don't eat fruit without peeling it first. Don't drink unpasteurised or unheated drinks that have been heated to a temperature that would kill viruses.\"\n\nWhile there are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, a number of vaccine candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nProfessor Hunter says while Nipah is a dangerous virus with a high fatality rate, it hasn't yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans, making it's global spread at this stage unlikely.\n\nHowever, he says its long incubation period does pose potential challenges to tracking its movement across borders - as it's also difficult to detect in the early stage.\n\n\"It's about one to two weeks, (the time for symptoms to show) maybe a little bit sooner in some, and sometimes a lot longer than that. I think the longest has been 45 days. And what this means is that it's actually very difficult to control at airports, if you've got a disease that's got a two-week incubation period, you know, for the first two weeks after somebody's carrying the infection, there's no way you can pick it up.\"",

He pulls his phone from his pocket, lights up the screen and focuses on her image. It is a reassuring habit the 31-year-old moguls specialist has formed since becoming a father in September 2024 that will help drive him towards Winter Olympics gold next month. \u201cI found myself doing it just this past season, which I didn\u2019t expect,\u201d he tells this masthead. Matt Graham with a world championships silver medal in 2023. Credit: Getty Images \u201cShe\u2019s my background on my phone, so during competitions, when the stakes are high and the pressures up, I\u2019d often just like, pull my phone out, just open it up, sort of blow her a kiss and just say, \u2018let\u2019s f...ing go\u2019. \u201cI just found myself doing that naturally. It wasn\u2019t planned. It\u2019s more my way of just getting in the zone and getting amped up for the event.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGraham has embraced fatherhood. Despite the added complications for an athlete who lives in Sydney and competes on the other side of the globe, it provides him with extra motivation as he prepares for the Olympics in northern Italy, which begin on February 6. \u201cMy day-to-day life as an athlete hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot,\u201d he says. \u201cBut mentally, it\u2019s quite different. I feel like there\u2019s more purpose when I\u2019m away. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it just for me.\u201d Matt Graham during moguls qualfying at the 2022 Beijing Games. Credit: Getty Graham and his partner Jess had daughter Ada in September 2024 and were married 13 months later in October last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a big step, obviously,\u201d he says. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s a parent sort of knows that the transition can be quite full on. But yeah, I mean, Jess and I were both ready to become parents. \u201cWe\u2019d obviously spoken about it a lot, leading up to us trying to be parents, and then once it eventually happened, it was about preparing for the hard times when I was going to be away.\u201d Graham had a patchy season last year. But he bounced back in sparkling fashion last month, winning a World Cup moguls event in Ruka, Finland. It was a unique double for Australia as Jakara Anthony also won gold. \u201cMy performances in the past season were, it was a bit of a rocky road,\u201d Graham says. \u201cBut the failures, or the times I didn\u2019t succeed on the competition tour, it made it easier to get over because I would just go home and get Jess on FaceTime and, I mean, yeah, my daughter, Ada, she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just smiling and yapping away. So it makes that easier to sort of push past and move on from those downtimes.\u201d Graham hit a low point in December 2021. Coming off an Olympic silver medal in South Korea in 2018, he broke his collarbone in a heavy fall in Sweden just two months out from the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Despite an intensive rehabilitation program, he was far from his best. He competed in pain and finished 29th. Matt Graham during moguls qualifying at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Credit: Getty The experience rocked Graham. He admits he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d and considered calling time on his career. But the qualified civil engineer made some adjustments and rediscovered his love of the sport before he had to overcome more setbacks. His collarbone hadn\u2019t healed properly, and he was sent for further surgery. \u201cGenerally speaking, a broken collarbone is an easy injury to come back from, but unfortunately, mine was a little bit more complicated,\u201d Graham told the NSW Institute of Sport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had some issues with the bone healing. Consequently, I had to undergo four completely separate surgeries, which prolonged the injury over a two-year period.\u201d After the operations and three sets of plates and screws, Graham then had to rediscover the right mindset. \u201cSometimes, you know, you\u2019ll have a big crash, a big stumble, and you\u2019ve got to get back up and right your wrong, and learn from that mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve developed a bit of a way to push past those things and just know that I\u2019ll be fine. If I attack a course, and I\u2019m hesitant or conservative, then I\u2019m at more risk than if I more or less just attack it. \u201cSometimes a moguls course can be pretty daunting, it can be steep, it can be icy, in some cases it can be a little bit scary. So, I guess you have to have a screw or two loose to take that step and really attack each day in each competition. \u201c[But] I\u2019d say generally I\u2019m quite conservative in life. The risks we do out in the snow, they\u2019re very calculated.\n\nAdvertisement",

The kitchen of matriarch Pat (Meredith Rogers, centre) becomes the focal point of The Placeholder. Darren Gill Ben MacEllen\u2019s The Placeholder is the latest play to wade into thorny territory. We\u2019re plunged headfirst into 2017, notably the year queer communities were subjected to a plebiscite on marriage equality.

Matriarch Pat (Meredith Rogers) is a soft-spoken retiree whose kitchen becomes the focal point of the play, brilliantly materialised by Bethany J. Fellows\u2019s set design. Helen (Michelle Perera) is a widow with a heart of gold and a penchant for baking. A proud lesbian, Keira (Rebecca Bower) self-medicates with alcohol to withstand living in a cloistered town. Barb\u2019s niece Jo (Brigid Gallacher) is the conservative black sheep of the group. And sporty Nic (Oliver Ayres) used to go by Nicole, until they announce they\u2019re transitioning into a man. The reprisal is swift. The elder members of the group, Pat and Helen, paradoxically take it in their stride, but Keira is incensed by the perceived loss of a lesbian peer, and Jo insists it\u2019s all but a phase. The remainder of the play details the fallout of Nic continuously insisting on his personhood against bad-faith arguments and a gulf of miscomprehensions. As the kindest, most level-headed character, Helen is who most audiences will project themselves onto. But Perera, so brilliant in This Is Living, is also the strongest of the ensemble. Her comedic timing is impeccable as she expertly oscillates between empathetic displays of allyship and perfectly executed moments of humour that imbue the play with levity at key junctures. Pat (Meredith Rogers) and Nic (Oliver Ayres) in The Placeholder.

A cookie-cutter bigot, Jo\u2019s views cover well-trodden, odious ground. But it\u2019s Keira\u2019s see-sawing between solidarity and gender essentialism and a self-victimisation that\u2019s impervious to the marginalisation of others that\u2019s harder to stomach \u2013 and altogether more interesting. Related Article Exclusive\n\nArts From a New York bathroom to regional Victoria: An exhibition of art\u2019s heavy hitters is on its way MacEllen presents thought-provoking contrasts between desired gender-affirming care and unwanted life-saving surgery, gender and sexuality, mental deterioration and newly prized lucidity. But at close to three hours, The Placeholder is simply too long. MacEllen\u2019s script retreads familiar ground in the play\u2019s second act, which drags lugubriously to its emotional climax(es). The tenuous connecting thread of a makeshift charity doesn\u2019t explain why these characters are so invested in one another, and why they tolerate unconscionable behaviour \u2013 particularly from Jo. As a result, the emotional payoffs are muted, hampered further by unnatural, dialogue-heavy exposition and uneven acting during key dramatic reveals. Much is left unresolved by close. Keira\u2019s alcohol addiction continues to be the butt of jokes, Pat\u2019s clear descent into dementia is unremarked upon. String-heavy interludes between scenes are peppered with a greatest hits compilation of what happened in the intervening years \u2013 good, bad, ridiculous. But the cacophony, so effective initially in illustrating the overwhelm of the plebiscite, overpowers the play by the end. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

Got it Share A A A\n\nPlucky ASX-listed gold junior Premier1 has locked up full ownership of one of the Yalgoo greenstone belt\u2019s last remaining gold packages in Western Australia, not already in the hands of a multi-billion dollar gold producer. The company says it has secured complete control over 266 square kilometres of prime Yalgoo real estate, as the relentless WA gold consolidation by district majors continues to unfold and gold jumps to a monstrous price of US$5500 (A$7800) an ounce. Reverse circulation drilling underway at Premier1\u2019s Yalgoo gold project. The deal completes the final piece in Premier1\u2019s evolving WA gold narrative, positioning the company as the remaining independent player in a greenstone belt tug-of-war between the $9.7 billion Ramelius Resources and the $7.3 billion Capricorn Metals. The company and its high-grade Wadgingarra gold prospect are now sitting pretty, with a 13,000-ounce starter resource grading an enticing 2.7 grams per tonne (g/t) gold at the top end of the Yalgoo-Singleton greenstone belt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These transactions simplify the ownership structure and grant the Company full control\u2019 Premier1 executive director Simon Phillips Ramelius holds most of the northern flank after its mid-2025 acquisition of Spartan Resources for a lazy $2.4 billion, while Capricorn has steadily expanded south thanks to a $188 million Warriedar-Golden Range acquisition and a landgrab of Tempest\u2019s ground in December of last year. Premier1 says its tenure sits squarely in the middle of these two players and shares all the same shears and geological signatures that have made the underexplored region so very valuable to all its neighbours. Newly appointed Premier1 executive director Simon Phillips said: \u201cConsolidating 100% ownership of Yalgoo represents a significant strategic milestone for Premier1. These transactions simplify the ownership structure and grant the Company full control over exploration, development and capital allocation decisions across a highly prospective gold portfolio.\u201d Yalgoo is a district long recognised for its high-grade orogenic gold and copper potential. The project runs along strike from the world-class Golden Grove base metals operation, which has been successfully operating for the better part of half a century and from the more recent discoveries at Capricorn Metals\u2019 Golden Range gold-antimony project to the south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPremier1\u2019s Yalgoo project lies just 10 kilometres southeast of Ramelius\u2019 Melville and Applecross prospects, which host some 5.2 million tonnes of resource at 1.4 g/t for 244,000 ounces. This ground was the focus of much of Spartan Resources\u2019 exploration and prospectivity before the multi-million-ounce discovery of Never Never at its Dalgaranga project stole the show to the Northeast. Needless to say, there remains plenty of unfinished business in the northern reaches of the Yalgoo-Singleton. 29Metal\u2019s Golden Grove base metals operation within the Yalgoo greenstone belt has been successfully operating for more than 35 years. Premier1\u2019s flagship Wadgingarra prospect at Yalgoo anchors the project, where a maiden resource of 13,000 ounces sits within a conservative Whittle-optimised pit shell drawn up last year. The high-grade gold starts at surface at site and remains open along strike and at depth. The company says limited exploration has been conducted to define its high-grade resource, with historical shallow drilling averaging just 46m in depth at the project, focused only on oxide zones near old workings. Premier1\u2019s maiden reverse-circulation program in early 2025 marked the first substantial modern drilling at the ground since the 1980\u2019s. That\u2019s a staggering amount of time considering the inherited high-grade near-surface intercepts up to 5 metres at 5.1g/t gold, 10 metres at 6.4 g/t gold and 2 metres at 20.8 g/t gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot surprisingly, then, the newer rod spin last year not only confirmed the presence of gold but also delivered some of the strongest intercepts recorded on the project. At its Crescent prospect in the north, one hole returned a staggering 3m hit running 31.5g/t gold from just 97m, including 1m at 91.9g/t gold, confirming bonanza-grade potential along trend from historical high-grade zones. At the company\u2019s Carlisle prospect to the south, drilling extended mineralisation eastward with a 10-metre hit grading a handy 3.1g/t gold from 19m, including 7m at 4.3 g/t gold. A new zone west of Olive Queen also intersected mineralisation for the first time, with 1m at 1.5g/t gold within broader anomalous intervals and pathfinder support. The results were a fantastic first go at the ground, built directly on systematic work by Premier1. The intercepted structures identified from high-resolution magnetics and rock-chip sampling were full of high-grade gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company says it\u2019s eager to get back onto the ground and test its litany of litho-structural targets, including its fast-emerging Mt Kersey prospect in the East. Work at Mt Kersey has turned up a multi-kilometre pathfinder soil anomaly that coincides with double-digit gold grades from rock chips in what the company says is a complex structural setting linked to quartz-dolerite and gabbro rocks similar to regional gold systems. Premier1 boasts some 25kms of proven shear at Wadgingarra, where the shear trends under cover for kilometres to the south, offering scope for regional aircore and magnetics to chase previously overlooked district-scale extensions. The company, however, is far from a one-trick pony. Its second major project \u2013 Abbotts North - lies up the road in perhaps one of WA\u2019s most active gold regions, along the Meekathara-Murchison greenstone belt. The project is a key second pillar to the company\u2019s portfolio and sits just 35km north of Meekatharra in the Abbotts greenstones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is also just 20 kilometres from ASX-darling New Murchison Gold\u2019s Crown Prince deposit, which has propelled that company\u2019s market capitalisation towards A$800 million after making the high-grade discovery just 2 years ago. Rochefort \u2013 the flagship prospect at Abbotts North \u2013 sits along strike from New Murchison and has emerged as a priority walk-up target, thanks to a 350m-by-350m gold anomaly above a dolerite host rock. Heritage clearances are advancing for a planned regional aircore drill program and an ultrafine soil sampling campaign later in the year, both backed by an existing $180,000 EIS government grant and a $180,000 drill credit with Strike Drilling, all waiting in Premier1\u2019s back pocket. The company\u2019s prime ground is now paired with renewed corporate drive, as experienced gold hand Simon Phillips takes the reins. With a career spanning discovery to development, his promotion comes alongside a $650,000 raise to sustain exploration momentum into 2026. Also joining the revitalised company is Mr Dale Hanna. A chartered accountant with more than 20 years of experience across ASX-listed resource companies, his background spans the full spectrum of mining operations from early-stage exploration through to production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining Hanna and Phillips on the board, previous managing director Jason Froud - who helped steer Premier1 through its strategic pivot from lithium to gold \u2013 will stay on, transitioning to a non-executive director role. Boasting shallow high-grade gold at Wadgingarra, walk-up targets at Mt Kersey and numerous processing options in the region, the company\u2019s Yalgoo gold tilt looks to be only beginning. As majors build empires to the north and south of both the company\u2019s projects, Premier1 and its expanding resources could soon add even more shine to the region\u2019s reputation. For now, though, the gold minnow - capped at just $6.5 million - is looking at a fresh new chapter of drilling in 2026 and hopeful it can turn that potential into reality.

Following higher-than-expected inflation figures this week in which Brisbane led the nation on 5.2 per cent, analysis suggests several workforces are set for a topped-up annual wage rise. Queensland public servants could be in for a wage boost. Matt Dennien The potential for inflation uplift included in state wage deals inked last year forced the Crisafulli government to set aside $169 million in its December budget update \u2013 amid concern from ratings agencies and economists. Bargaining concessions from government last year added $345 million above the budgeted cost of its blanket wage policy, dictating rises of 3 per cent in 2025-26, and 2.5 per cent in the following two years of the deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the finalised deals spanning police, firefighters, paramedics, nurses, doctors, health administration staff, and non-teaching school staff and others, also featured potential inflation-related pay bumps. Should the March inflation figure for Brisbane pass the agreed pay rise for that financial year, pay will instead be matched to inflation \u2013 to a 2025-26 cap of up to 0.5 per cent. Queensland Treasurer David Janetzki blamed the inflation spike on the end of electricity rebates. Renee Nowytarger For a public servant on the average sector salary of about $100,000, this could add up to $500 to their base annual pay. Any inflation-adjusted increase to pay rises will also be backdated across the entire financial year, and form the base pay rate from which future rises are also calculated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake said while the December quarter spike in Brisbane inflation was essentially an anomaly caused by energy rebates ending, the March figure was likely to be above the 3 per cent pay bump trigger. Related Article Queensland budget Qld avoids credit rating downgrade. But state\u2019s books \u2018remain grim\u2019 He said that meant the spike was essentially caused by the former Miles government\u2019s extensive pre-election rebates, criticised by some as an inflation-driving attempt to buy votes. Because of this, he believed it was \u201cludicrous that the unwinding of that is the catalyst for the paying of more taxpayer money to a smaller group of public servants\u201d. \u201cI would think the Queensland government probably needs to prepare itself to have a stoush over that,\u201d Eslake told this masthead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cQueensland isn\u2019t in the worst [budget] position of Australian states \u2026 but Queensland\u2019s financial position has deteriorated quite significantly from what was the best in the country. \u201cAnd this would be another serious blow to that.\u201d Treasurer David Janetzki\u2019s office stressed the headline annual inflation rise in Queensland to November was below the national headline figure, which meant the growth revealed this week was caused by short-term factors \u2013 primarily the end of electricity rebates. He also criticised Labor for enacting temporary cost-of-living measures, saying his government was \u201cdoing its bit to ease cost pressures facing families\u201d. Deputy Opposition Leader Cameron Dick blamed the government for high inflation and said while the extra pay bump might help some, many people were struggling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDavid Crisafulli is delivering the highest state inflation in the country as his affordability crisis deepens, and it will cost the state\u2019s budget hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. While in government, Labor had argued its power bill rebates had helped ease inflation by reducing the electricity bill element of the official figures. In December, the state government revealed in its midyear budget update the state operating balance fell almost $400 million further into deficit.

It might not be in the form of a bill sent to your home, or a bite taken out of your payslip every fortnight, but nearly all of us are paying a big cost we shouldn\u2019t be. The problem is: it\u2019s not really visible unless you know about it. It\u2019s not too late to take inspiration from countries such as Norway, which has \u2013 largely through its taxing of resources \u2013 built up the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund. Matt Davidson You\u2019ve probably heard plenty about the need to tax resources companies more: not just for the pollution they pump into the atmosphere and damage they cause to the environment, but also because they\u2019re effectively making money out of digging up rocks, metals and gasses which don\u2019t belong to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there\u2019s an argument they don\u2019t really belong to any of us, except Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have looked after the land for centuries before colonisation. But as long as companies are continuing to mine resources, it makes sense for them to pay for the privilege \u2013 and to pay an amount that properly compensates for the damage caused by their businesses. It also makes sense for us to incentivise them to clean up their act. That\u2019s where the Superpower Institute (started by economist Professor Ross Garnaut and former competition watchdog head Rod Sims) kicks in. They may not have found a way to harness superpowers such as invisibility, but they (and experts Dr Ingrid Burford and Dr Reuben Finighan) have found a way to rein in the invisible villain that is greenhouse gas emissions. As their new report explains, between 2020 and 2023, Australia\u2019s state and federal governments took 30 per cent of fossil fuel companies\u2019 profits (mostly through a patchwork of corporate tax, royalties and the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat might seem like a decent chunk, but it\u2019s much less than the 75 to 90 per cent that other major fossil fuel exporting countries claw back, and not nearly enough to make up for the costs of pollution or to move us towards net zero fast enough. If we continue as we are, we\u2019ll struggle to fund essential services and to lift spending on education, new technologies and infrastructure: things we need to do if we\u2019re going to boost productivity. Meanwhile, as natural disasters become more frequent, our insurance costs are going up, and we\u2019re paying more at the checkout every time severe droughts or floods wipe out our farmers\u2019 harvests. It also comes at a time when the country needs a stronger budget to prepare for the bigger health and aged care bills that will come with an ageing population, to shield us from international shocks, and lift our living standards. Budget deficits are not always bad, but always having budget deficits is, and we\u2019re still a decade away from returning to surplus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we continue as we are, we\u2019ll struggle to fund essential services and to lift spending on education, new technologies and infrastructure: things we need to do if we\u2019re going to boost productivity (our ability to produce and do things better, faster or using fewer resources). Related Article Updated\n\nEnergy \u2018Landmark moment\u2019: Renewables\u2019 record surge sends power prices tumbling Luckily, there\u2019s a big group of companies that can play a big role in this \u2013 but how do we get them to cough up? Right now, we rely on policies such as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d where the country\u2019s biggest industrial facilities are forced to limit their emissions (and, if they emit more than they\u2019re allowed to, to pay for emission-reducing projects by buying \u201ccarbon credits\u201d). There are several problems, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mechanism allows companies to buy their way out of actually reducing their own emissions, and often, the \u201ccredits\u201d they buy can be for projects that don\u2019t actually make as much difference as they claim, or projects which would have gone ahead anyway \u2013 and it fails to generate any government revenue. Instead, the first policy proposed by the Superpower Institute is a \u201cpolluter pays levy\u201d \u2013 or PPL \u2013 which would apply to coal, oil and gas extracted and consumed in Australia, and to fossil fuel imports including oil, petrol and diesel. For example, a company that mines and sells black coal would pay a levy for the methane released during their mining process and the carbon dioxide released when the coal is combusted to produce electricity. The levy would start this year at $17 for every tonne of CO2 \u2013 or equivalent amount of another greenhouse gas \u2013 rising gradually until it hits the European Union\u2019s carbon price in 2034, then continue tracking the EU carbon price. It would cover more than 80 per cent of Australia\u2019s emissions, would be more straightforward and difficult to game than current policies, and raise nearly $23 billion of revenue on average every year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s important because while Australians tend to support policies and actions to reduce emissions, we\u2019re sensitive to cost-of-living pressures such as energy bills. Most of us want to do the right thing, but when it costs us more, we might think twice. The revenue from the levy would partly be used to reimburse households for higher energy costs \u2013 even generating enough to over-compensate them. Whether $330 a year, as proposed by the institute, is enough for households to feel they are better off is up for some debate. But if polling is anything to go by, it\u2019s a policy that has a decent amount of public support. More than 60 per cent in a survey of 3000 voters (conducted by Redbridge Research for the Superpower Institute) agreed or strongly agreed with a polluter-pays levy. Overall, the institute reckons compensation for households would cost about $4.1 billion a year on average: less than one quarter of the revenue raised from the levy. Small businesses would also receive $325 a year, and compensation for households could be more targeted, starting at $490 a year for the bottom 75 per cent of households by income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe levy would also crucially help reduce Australia\u2019s annual carbon emissions by about 2.3 times more than under current policies according to the research. Related Article Opinion\n\nAI Robots, redundancies and runaway spending: Not all AI hits the mark Elizabeth Knight Business columnist The institute also suggests a \u201cfair share levy\u201d on gas exports, mirroring the system Norwegians have in place. The existing Petroleum Resources Rent Tax, introduced in the 1980s, doesn\u2019t work very well, especially for Australia\u2019s liquefied natural gas industry. Why? In short: because gas projects usually take decades (and a lot more money) to build than oil projects. Gas extracting companies can deduct these building costs (which they can carry across from one year to the next, and which can balloon every year to account for interest and inflation), effectively leaving them tax-free \u2013 sometimes forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the fair share levy, which would collect 40 per cent of the large profits that gas companies pocket over time, would be based on expenses and revenues companies face within the year. The government would take a fixed share of profits or losses each year, with a tax refund given to companies in a loss-making year. Since profits from the Australian oil and gas industry overwhelmingly flow to foreign shareholders, taxing these profits means Australians will be better off, with the annual benefit \u2013 at its peak \u2013 being about $1500 for every Australian household. The tax revenue generated from the two levies \u2013 averaging nearly $36 billion each year \u2013 could be used not only to compensate households and get the budget in better shape to fund essential services, but to invest in green industries where Australia has a competitive edge over many other countries. While we can\u2019t claw back the resources, emissions or money we\u2019ve let float by us, it\u2019s not too late to take inspiration from countries such as Norway, which has \u2013 largely through its taxing of resources \u2013 built up the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund. Perhaps most crucially, if we act now, we can set ourselves up to be a superpower in the global green transition.

In 2021 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) issued a draft recommendation that the Great Barrier Reef should be listed as an \u201cin danger\u201d World Heritage site. Bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef. AP Since then Australia has been locked in a multi-year battle to prevent that listing taking effect, a listing it says could place thousands of jobs at risk, particularly in tourism. Last year UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Committee ordered a full review of Australia\u2019s management of the Great Barrier Reef, following the sixth mass bleaching event in nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe body identified four areas of concern: climate pollution, water quality, climate-driven disasters like mass bleaching, and fisheries management. The government estimates the Great Barrier Reef contributes more than $9 billion a year to the Australian economy and, as the nation\u2019s fifth-biggest employer, supports 77,000 jobs. Coral scientists capture larvae during this year\u2019s annual coral spawning on the Great Barrier Reef. The Reef Co-Operative \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Great Barrier Reef is under extreme pressure from a range of factors like climate change, crown-of-thorns starfish, again, still issues around sediment run-off and reef water quality,\u201d Environment Minister Murray Watt told ABC radio on Friday morning. \u201cBut what we can also say is that the actions that both levels of government, along with the broader community, are taking are making the reef more resilient towards those changes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to UNESCO, the government on Friday released a state party report on the steps it has undertaken to protect the reef\u2019s ecosystems, in a bid to maintain the reef\u2019s listing of Outstanding Universal Value. The report emphasised the significant amendments to federal environment laws, passed with the support of the Greens last year, as a key measure that would help protect the reef. It also highlighted the government\u2019s decision to increase Australia\u2019s emissions reduction targets and reduce land-clearing within 50 metres of a watercourse, wetland or drainage line in the reef catchment area. The Great Barrier Reef is under threat. iStock The federal government has spent $1.2 billion to help build the reef\u2019s resilience and says its total investment \u2013 in partnership with the Queensland government \u2013 is more than $5 billion since 2014. Watt said the reef was one of the best-managed reef systems in the world and that Australia had not just met every commitment it has made to protect the reef but gone further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Australia votes Great Barrier Reef bleaching turns up heat in key Coalition seat The Australian Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Great Barrier Reef campaign manager Dr Lissa Schindler said the government had taken positive steps to improve the reef\u2019s health but had not gone far enough. \u201cYes, they are pushing forward with renewable energy projects, but they\u2019re also pushing forward with fossil fuel projects, and fossil fuels, like oil and coal and gas, is what is actually driving climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s climate target is not in line with 1.5 degrees [of warming], which is what is needed for coral reefs to survive.\u201d When UNESCO first signalled its intention to delist the reef of its Outstanding Universal Value status in 2021, the then-Morrison government acknowledged that climate change was the single greatest threat to its survival but insisted that only global action to reduce emissions would have any meaningful impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt noted that Australia\u2019s emissions comprised just 1.3 per cent of the global total and said that \u201cAustralia\u2019s efforts to reduce its own emissions would have virtually no impact on the long-term health and resilience of the reef\u201d. The Albanese government has sought to emphasise Australia\u2019s stronger emissions reductions commitments under Labor. Under the Paris Agreement, Australia has set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 62-70 per cent below 2005 levels by 2035 \u2013 a measure Watt described as \u201cambitious and achievable\u201d. The federal government has also argued the Great Barrier Reef is not alone in experiencing mass bleaching events, which have affected coral reefs worldwide as climate change drives ocean temperatures up. In a letter to UNESCO World Heritage Centre director Lazare Eloundou Assomo, Watt pointed out the 2023-2024 bleaching event had also affected more than 84 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs in more than 80 other countries and territories. \u201cIn submitting this report, I want to strongly reiterate that Australia\u2019s management of the [Great Barrier] Reef is recognised as world-leading and our impactful and adaptive actions remain integral to protecting this World Heritage property\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value into the future,\u201d Watt wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAustralia continues to act on its commitments under the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change and remains willing to lend our substantial expertise to other countries with climate-affected World Heritage sites.\u201d The World Heritage Committee will consider Australia\u2019s response at a session to be held in July. If it deems Australia\u2019s response is insufficient, it will then consider listing the reef as \u201cWorld Heritage In Danger\u201d.

By then, Haas will be 28 and, if the proposed R360 rugby competition gets off the ground, he could be tempted by riches beyond anything available in the NRL. Alternatively, he could be precisely the type of marquee signing the Perth Bears will come chasing. Brisbane will want to retain Payne Haas beyond the 2026 season. Credit: Getty Images The Broncos would no doubt love to re-sign Haas to a long-term deal. The ageing legs of halves Ben Hunt and Adam Reynolds don\u2019t have many more tomorrows left. Haas, on the other hand, is a franchise player, at the top of his game.\n\nKey gains: Aublix Tawha (Dolphins), Grant Anderson (Storm), Tom Duffy (Cowboys).\n\nKey losses: Selwyn Cobbo (Dolphins), Kobe Hetherington (Sea Eagles), Tyson Smoothy (Wakefield)\n\nComing off contract: Adam Reynolds, Ben Hunt, Gehamat Shibasaki, Billy Walters, Jack Gosiewski, Payne Haas, Cory Paix, Jesse Arthars. Storm (runners-up) Harry Grant comes to terms with another grand final loss. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story? First Ryan Papenhuyzen and Nelson Asofa-Solomona announced they were taking sabbaticals. Next Eliesa Katoa suffered a horrific concussion playing for Tonga that will sideline him for 2026 at least, and then the Perth Bears swooped to sign Nick Meaney and Tyran Wishart for their 2027 foundation season.\n\nAll this, on top of losing back-to-back grand finals, does not augur well, but the Melbourne Storm are no ordinary team. Nonetheless, it shapes as a bit of a rebuilding operation, and nobody is better qualified to oversee the process than Craig Bellamy, arguably the greatest coach in the game. Of course, the big question remains: how long will 66-year-old Bellamy continue? He has been quite content to sign one-year extensions, while hinting retirement is not far away. Players are replaceable, but Melbourne must be dreading the day \u201cBellyache\u201d informs them he\u2019s pulling the pin. They\u2019ll be hoping his era continues beyond this season. Key gains: Jack Hetherington (Knights), Davvy Moale (Rabbitohs), Manaia Waitere (Raiders)\n\nKey losses: Ryan Papenhuyzen, Nelson Asofa-Solomona (both released), Jonah Pezet (Eels), Grant Anderson (Broncos)\n\nComing off contract: Will Warbrick, Shawn Blore, Jack Hetherington, Tui Kamikamica.\n\nPanthers (preliminary final) It\u2019s back to square one for Penrith after Brisbane ended their dynasty in last year\u2019s preliminary final. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Compared to the spotlight they commanded during their four-year reign as champions, the Panthers have spent the off-season flying under the radar, which no doubt suits coach Ivan Cleary just fine. Rival teams, however, are entitled to be nervous: how hungry will the deposed champions be after surrendering their title?\n\nComplacency can bring even the greatest of teams undone, once they\u2019ve been there, won that, on multiple occasions. Do they have the willpower to get back up there? Nathan Cleary, the ultimate competitor and perfectionist, will surely relish the challenge. Beware the Panthers. They\u2019re not done yet. Key gains: Jack Cogger (Knights), Tom Ale (Warriors), Freddy Lussick (Warriors)\n\nKey losses: Brad Schneider (Dolphins), Daine Laurie (Raiders), Mavrik Geyer (Tigers), Trent Toelau (Storm), Soni Luke (Cowboys)\n\nComing off contract: Scott Sorensen, Luke Garner, Lindsay Smith, Matt Eisenhuth, Tom Ale. Sharks (preliminary final)\n\nThe Sharks were furious with the performance of referee Ashley Klein in last year\u2019s preliminary final. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Shark Park was a hive of activity last week, on and off the field. As Cronulla\u2019s players completed a gruelling training session under the eye of coach Fitzgibbon, tradesmen were just as hard at work in the adjoining building site. It is hoped they will have completed the fit-out of the leagues club redevelopment by mid-to-late 2026, allowing the Sharks to reopen for the first time in six years, after myriad construction delays.\n\nThey\u2019ll be hoping it improves their financial position to the point where they can apply for government funding for a centre of excellence, which would put them on level footing with their Sydney-based NRL rivals. Meanwhile, Fitzgibbon and his very settled squad are not satisfied with back-to-back appearances in preliminary finals. Old-school training facilities might yet provide the steely edge that helps them claim the ultimate prize. Key gains: None\n\nKey losses: Daniel Atkinson (Dragons), Kade Dykes (Bulldogs)\n\nComing off contract: Cam McInnes, Siosifa Talakai, Sione Katoa, Jesse Ramien, Sam Stonestreet, Toby Rudolf, Will Kennedy, Braden Hamlin-Uele, Billy Burns. Raiders (semi-finalists) The Canberra Raiders won the minor premiership but lost both play-offs. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? Coach Ricky Stuart is set to give 22-year-old Ethan Sanders first shot at steering the Raiders after the departure of halfback Jamal Fogarty. Stuart has plenty of faith in Sanders, who has played four NRL matches across the past two seasons with the Raiders and Eels. Sanders is also a handy goalkicker, which could make him a like-for-like replacement for Fogarty, now at Manly. And he\u2019ll have the perfect mentor in Stuart, one of the greatest halfbacks of all time.\n\nStuart guided the Green Machine to the minor premiership last season, but heartbreak followed when they bowed out of the finals with back-to-back defeats. They\u2019ll be primed to give a better account of themselves this year at the business end of proceedings. Key gains: Jayden Brailey (Knights), Daine Laurie (Panthers), Coby Black (Broncos), Sione Finau (Dragons)\n\nKey losses: Jamal Fogarty (Sea Eagles), Trey Mooney (Knights), Pasami Saulo (Knights), Danny Levi (Leeds)\n\nComing off contract: Josh Papali\u2019i, Morgan Smithies, Chevy Stewart Bulldogs (semi-finalists) The Bulldogs contemplate their season-ending defeat against the Panthers. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story?\n\nAs the first major signing of Canterbury\u2019s rebuild, Matt Burton has been both a catalyst for change and a cornerstone of their success the past two seasons. Burton\u2019s form last year was as good as ever, yet there is already speculation that he will be squeezed out at the end of this season, despite being contracted until the end of 2027. The theory goes that the Bulldogs want Lachlan Galvin to play five-eighth, his natural position, and they have a promising young half waiting in the wings called Mitchell Woods. Whether Burton is the odd man out remains to be seen, but if he wants to win a premiership with Canterbury \u2013 to add to the one he collected at Penrith \u2013 there\u2019s no time like the present. After finishing third last season before exiting the finals in straight sets, the Bulldogs will be hoping former Knights prop Leo Thompson can give them a new dimension.\n\nKey gains: Leo Thompson (Knights), Kade Dykes (Sharks), Sean O\u2019Sullivan (Dolphins), Fletcher Baker (Broncos)\n\nKey losses: Reed Mahoney (Cowboys), Toby Sexton (Catalans), Blake Wilson (Sea Eagles)\n\nComing off contract: Connor Tracey, Daniel Suluka-Fifita, Jake Turpin, Kurt Mann, Marcelo Montoya. Warriors (finalists) Luke Metcalf was leading the 2025 Dally M count before he suffered a season-ending knee injury in June. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Coach Andrew Webster will be sweating on the return of co-captain Mitch Barnett and halfback Luke Metcalf from season-ending knee reconstructions.\n\nBefore the loss of NSW and Kangaroos forward Barnett last June, the Warriors had won nine of their first 12 games and were sitting second on the ladder. Metcalf, who was leading the Dally M voting, was sidelined soon after, and Webster\u2019s men eventually limped home in sixth position, before being bundled out by Penrith in week one of the play-offs. Barnett hopes to launch his comeback inside the first few rounds. Metcalf is aiming for round seven. The Warriors are expecting big things from new signing Alofiana Khan-Pereira, who was a prolific try-scorer at the Gold Coast. And Barnett has also tipped English forward Morgan Gannon to make an immediate impact. Main gains: Alofiana Khan-Pereira (Titans), Morgan Gannon (Leeds)\n\nMain losses: Bunty Afoa (Tigers), Freddy Lussick (Panthers), Tom Ale (Panthers)\n\nComing off contract: Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, Kurt Capewell, Marata Niukore, Chanel Harris-Tavita, Rocco Berry, Te Maire Martin, Tanah Boyd.\n\nRoosters (finalists) Roosters skipper James Tedesco and new recruit Daly Cherry-Evans. Credit: Peter Rae What\u2019s the story? Can Daly Cherry-Evans emulate Cooper Cronk and become a premiership-winning talisman with the Roosters? The former Manly skipper might be the oldest player in the NRL, turning 37 before the season kicks off, but he is likely to turn the Chooks into contenders again. The DCE coup has commanded so much attention it is easy to forget the Roosters have also signed the incumbent NSW hooker, Reece Robson, from the Cowboys.\n\nAdding further depth to an imposing squad, Tommy Talau (Manly) and Cody Ramsey (St George Illawarra) are waiting in the wings, in case Trent Robinson loses any of his outside backs to injury. On the flip side, Kangaroos stars Angus Crichton and Mark Nawaqanitawase will switch codes at season\u2019s end, in the hope of winning a World Cup with the Wallabies. They will no doubt have their hearts set on a grand final lap of honour before clocking off. Key gains: Daly Cherry-Evans (Sea Eagles), Reece Robson (Cowboys), Tommy Talau (Sea Eagles), Cody Ramsey (Dragons)\n\nKey losses: Sandon Smith (Knights), Zach Dockar-Clay (Sea Eagles)\n\nComing off contract: Daly Cherry-Evans, Daniel Tupou, Siua Wong, Tommy Talau. Dolphins (ninth)\n\nThomas Flegler hasn\u2019t played since he was injured against the Wests Tigers in round five, 2024. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story? They came within one win of a maiden finals berth last season, and now the Dolphins will be bolstered by an influx of quality reinforcements. Former Queensland and Kangaroos prop Thomas Flegler, who hasn\u2019t played for almost two years after suffering career-threatening nerve damage in his shoulder, will return. Tom Gilbert (pectoral), Daniel Saifiti (shoulder), Max Plath (knee) and Jack Bostock (knee) won\u2019t be too far behind him. Throw in English import Morgan Knowles \u2013 a four-time Super League winner with St Helens \u2013 and the Dolphins should have some serious muscle in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, after scoring 721 points last season \u2013 the most by any team during the regular season \u2013 the Dolphins have added explosive Selwyn Cobbo to their backline. In Cobbo and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, Dolphins coach Kristian Woolf will have two strike weapons capable of scoring from anywhere. Key gains: Selwyn Cobbo (Broncos), Morgan Knowles (St Helens), Brad Schneider (Panthers)\n\nKey losses: Josh Kerr (Dragons), Mark Nicholls, Kenny Bromwich (both retired), Max Feagai (Titans), Aublix Tawha (Broncos), Sean O\u2019Sullivan (Bulldogs)\n\nComing off contract: Selwyn Cobbo, Jamayne Isaako, Brad Schneider, Jake Averillo, Francis Molo, Ray Stone, Trai Fuller, Kodi Nikorima. Manly Sea Eagles (10th) Manly players after their scrimmage with St George Illawarra last week. Credit: Max Mason-Hubers\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? For the first time since he debuted in 2011 \u2013 the last time Manly won a premiership \u2013 the Sea Eagles head into a season without Daly Cherry-Evans in their No.7 jersey. But after signing former Canberra playmaker Jamal Fogarty, Manly coach Anthony Seibold will be hoping the transition is seamless. The Sea Eagles finished two points outside the top eight last year, but they were cruelled by season-ending injuries to big men Taniela Paseka and Haumole Olakau\u2019atu, and Jake Trbojevic\u2019s concussion. As always, much will depend on Tom Trbojevic, who will lead the new era after succeeding Cherry-Evans as skipper and return to his preferred fullback role. His fitness and form will be crucial to Manly\u2019s finals hopes, and in turn to Seibold\u2019s job security.\n\nThe Sea Eagles have reached the play-offs just once during Seibold\u2019s three seasons. He is contracted until the end of 2027, but needs a breakout season to keep the wolves from the door. Key gains: Jamal Fogarty (Raiders), Kobe Hetherington (Broncos), Zach Docker-Clay (Roosters)\n\nKey losses: Daly Cherry-Evans (Roosters), Tommy Talau (Roosters), Matt Lodge (Cowboys), Toafofoa Sipley (Warrington), Josh Aloiai, Lachlan Croker (both retired), Jazz Tevaga (Wakefield)\n\nComing off contract: Jake Trbojevic, Tolutau Koula, Siosiua Taukeiaho. Parramatta Eels (11th) The Eels and former winger Zac Lomax are set for a legal battle. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story?\n\nWhat, or who, will the Eels receive in exchange for Zac Lomax? That is the main narrative surrounding Parramatta after the protracted contractual impasse that prompted the club to launch legal action last week against the representative winger, to ensure he doesn\u2019t join a rival NRL team without their permission. The Eels agreed to release Lomax from his contract, believing he would head to rugby union. Instead, he wants to join the Melbourne Storm, who haven\u2019t overwhelmed the Eels with whatever they have offered in terms of financial compensation or a possible player exchange. Whatever transpires with Lomax, you can guarantee Eels coach Jason Ryles, an unflappable type, is getting on with business after delivering 10 wins in his rookie year as head coach in 2026. If Parramatta\u2019s improvement continues, their first finals appearance since 2022 appears a realistic outcome.\n\nKey gains: Jonah Pezet (Storm), Jack de Belin (Dragons), Brian Kelly (Titans)\n\nKey losses: Dylan Brown (Knights), Zac Lomax (released), Shaun Lane (retired), Brendan Hands (Toulouse), Dean Hawkins (London Broncos)\n\nComing off contract: Junior Paulo, Will Penisini, Dylan Walker, Joash Papalii, Kelma Tuilagi, Ryan Matterson North Queensland Cowboys (12th) Cowboys coach Todd Payten with veteran Jason Taumalolo. Credit: NRL Photos What\u2019s the story? Cowboys coach Todd Payten is unlikely to lose any sleep over constant speculation that he\u2019s a dead man walking if North Queensland cannot reach the finals in 2026.\n\nPayten is heading into his fifth season as North Queensland\u2019s tactician, and has made the finals in two of his previous four attempts. He has a 50 per cent winning record, which is second only to the late Paul Green, the sole coach to have steered the Cowboys to a premiership. Nonetheless, Payten is off contract at the end of this season, and the NRL is a ruthless industry, so nobody will need to remind him what is at stake. Any disappointment the Cowboys felt when NSW Origin hooker Reece Robson signed with the Roosters was offset by their recruitment of feisty Reed Mahoney from the Bulldogs. A favourable draw in the early rounds could potentially alleviate the pressure on Payten, providing the Cowboys can capitalise. Key gains: Reed Mahoney (Bulldogs), Matt Lodge (Sea Eagles), Soni Luke (Panthers)\n\nKey losses: Reece Robson (Roosters), Jordan McLean (retired), Karl Lawton (Hull KR)\n\nComing off contract: Murray Taulagi, Jake Clifford, Jaxon Purdue, Braidon Burns, John Bateman, Matt Lodge, Sam McIntyre.\n\nWests Tigers (13th) Wests Tigers fans have been waiting since 2011 to cheer for their team in the finals. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Regardless of the boardroom brawling late last year, culminating in the departure of chief executive Shane Richardson, the Wests Tigers players will be eager to continue their on-field improvement under coach Benji Marshall. Recruits Kai Pearce-Paul, the England and former Newcastle back-rower, and ex-Warriors prop Bunty Afoa should ensure the Tigers are more capable of throwing their weight around this season as they seek their first finals appearance since 2011.\n\nMarshall steered them to nine wins and 13th spot last season, a vast improvement on three consecutive wooden spoons. With Lachlan Galvin gone, the Tigers have a more settled look about them. Jarome Luai, Adam Doueihi, Api Koroisau and Jahream Bula are evolving into a quality spine, and irrespective of any boardroom shenanigans, Tigers fans are entitled to be optimistic their team can challenge for a play-off berth. Key gains: Kai Pearce-Paul (Knights), Bunty Afoa (Warriors), Mavrik Geyer (Panthers), Jock Madden (Broncos)\n\nKey losses: Charlie Staines (Catalans), Brent Naden (released)\n\nComing off contract: Jarome Luai, Jahream Bula, Jack Bird, Sione Fainu, Jeral Skelton, Mavrik Geyer, Tony Sukkar. South Sydney Rabbitohs (14th) Wayne Bennett delivered underwhelming returns on his return to South Sydney. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? Coach Wayne Bennett has been a driving force behind a proposed rule change, whereby teams that concede a try will be given the option of either receiving the ball from the restart, or kicking off themselves. There is plenty of opposition among rival coaches and fans to the \u201cscorer\u2019s kick-off\u201d plan, but by all accounts ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys is inclined to back Bennett. \u201cStop whingeing about it \u2026 if you listen to some of these guys [complaining], we\u2019d still be playing with unlimited tackles, and players would still be wearing black boots with white laces,\u201d was Bennett\u2019s response to the resistance. Regardless, Bennett faces a huge challenge at Souths. Last season was the worst result of his illustrious career, considering the Rabbitohs\u2019 final placing (14th) and win tally (nine). He hasn\u2019t had a team in the finals since 2021, and he hasn\u2019t won a premiership since 2011.\n\nHe\u2019s banking on enigmas like Latrell Mitchell, David Fifita and Brandon Smith to play consistently and avoid injuries, and for Cody Walker to keep defying Father Time. Key gains: David Fifita (Titans), Adam Elliott (Knights), Bronson Garlick (Storm), Jonah Glover (Dragons)\n\nKey losses: Davvy Moale (Storm), Lewis Dodd (Catalans), Mikaele Ravalawa (Castleford), Jacob Host (released), Siliva Havili (London), Shaquai Mitchell (released)\n\nComing off contract: Cody Walker, Jamie Humphreys, Sean Keppie, Adam Elliott, Liam Le Blanc Dragons (15th) The Dragons haven\u2019t featured in the NRL finals since 2018. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story?\n\nWill Shane Flanagan have to drop his own son? The Dragons coach has never been known to shy away from a tough call, and the arrival of Daniel Atkinson from Cronulla ensures Kyle Flanagan is no sure thing to retain the No.7 jersey he wore in 24 games last season. Flanagan could find himself shifting to five-eighth, or potentially out of the starting side altogether. The Dragons received a massive boost before Christmas when they signed Keaon Koloamatangi from Souths. A helicopter tour of the Illawarra apparently sealed the deal, but the Kangaroos forward won\u2019t arrive until 2027. In the interim, the Red V have to figure out how to win tight games. They suffered eight losses last year by six points or fewer. They\u2019ll need to kick that habit to have any hope of reaching the finals for the first time since 2018.\n\nKey gains: Daniel Atkinson (Sharks), Josh Kerr (Dolphins), Setu Tu (Warriors)\n\nKey losses: Jack de Belin (Eels), Lachlan Ilias (Titans), David Klemmer (St Helens), Cody Ramsey (Roosters)\n\nComing off contract: Damien Cook, Tyrell Sloan, Jaydn Su\u2019A, Emre Guler, Luciano Leilua, Blake Lawrie, Christian Tuipulotu. Titans (16th) A new era kicks off for the Titans under rookie coach Josh Hannay Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? Big Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui is one of the game\u2019s genuine warriors, and the Titans desperately need some early season success to have any hope of keeping the poachers at bay.\n\nThe Titans produced a great escape to avoid the 2025 wooden spoon, but rookie coach Josh Hannay might not be so fortunate in his debut season. Gold Coast appear to have cleared the deck for a spending spree, although it will require a leap of faith for Fa\u2019asuamaleaui to extend his stay. Hannay can only hope his new-look team, with Lachlan Ilias calling the shots at halfback, can offer their captain a glimmer of hope that they are on the right trajectory. Given their roster, that will surely be easier said than done. Key gains: Lachlan Ilias (Dragons), Max Feagai (Dolphins), Luke Sommerton (Panthers), Kurtis Morrin (Bulldogs)\n\nKey losses: David Fifita (Rabbitohs), Kieran Foran (retired), Reagan Campbell-Gillard (London), Carter Gordon (released), Alofiana Khan-Pereira (Warriors), Brian Kelly (Eels)\n\nComing off contract: Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, Phillip Sami, Sam Verrills, Jaimin Joliffe.\n\nKnights (17th) Newcastle are hoping to offload the wooden spoon this season. Credit: Getty Images What\u2019s the story? They\u2019re set to field a potentially lethal backline, having spent a fortune on former Eels five-eighth Dylan Brown, whose job will be to unlock the likes of Kalyn Ponga, Bradman Best, Dominic Young, Fletcher Sharpe and Dane Gagai. But before the Ferraris can show their class, they\u2019ll need a platform up front, and therein lies the problem for new coach Justin Holbrook in his first season at the helm of the incumbent wooden spooners.",

        "text": "Australian and European officials are scrambling to bridge the gap for an elusive free trade agreement as diplomatic heavyweights prepare a meeting to seal the deal.\n\nPlans are being drawn up for Trade Minister Don Farrell to meet with his European counterpart Maros Sefcovic, likely in Europe, before European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen travels to Australia at the end of February or start of March.\n\nThe president's visit could be viewed as a good omen after she travelled to India to sign a free trade agreement in mid-January, sealing a long-awaited deal between Europe and the world's most populous state.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen is set to visit Australia in coming weeks. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nSenator Farrell was scheduled to meet with Mr Sefcovic last Friday before the meeting was postponed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe final hurdles include quotas for the amount of beef and sheep Australian exporters can ship into Europe, with Canberra pushing for more than what's been offered.\n\nHowever, the conditions under which the meat can be exported have also proved contentious, with concerns Australian producers can't meet the stringent requirements, which would render any increased quota moot.\n\nEuropean conditions span deforestation regulations for farms, hormone-free growth and transport requirements.\n\nFor example, Canada used only a tiny fraction of its allocated 65,000 tonnes of tariff-free beef in recent years due to local farming and packaging practices, such as the use of hormones and how meat is sanitised, failing to meet European standards.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"As we have said consistently, a deal with the EU must include new, commercially meaningful access for Australian agriculture, including beef and sheep meat,\" a spokesperson for Senator Farrell told AAP.\n\nMr Farrell insists a deal must include access for Australian agriculture, including beef. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nEuropean farmers are also wary of the compounding impact of free trade agreements being signed with South American nations as part of the Mercosur agreement, and now with India as Brussels searches for a resolution with Australia.\n\nAustralian producers are pushing for higher quotas for beef and sheep while European farmers want them stripped back.\n\nDetails of the offered quotas haven't been made public.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGeographic indicators - when Australian producers use names of foods that come from specific regions, such as prosecco and feta - have also been a sticking point as Europe aims to protect the naming rights of products.\n\nIf beef and sheep quotas are sorted, the final negotiations over naming rights would then need to be finalised, but negotiators are confident of compromises here to get the agreement over the line.\n\nThe use of geographic indicators like 'Feta' have been a sticking point. (David Mariuz/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nIt's believed Australia would agree to a grandfathering clause, so producers already using the names could continue to do so.\n\nThis is in line with similar provisions in other trade pacts Europe has signed with Canada and New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCanadian producers need to add qualifiers to certain products, such as \"Feta-like\" when selling the cheese, as some names were grandfathered.\n\nNew Zealand agreed to a phase-out of terms like Feta and Prosecco but there is a grandfathered exemption for Parmesan and Gruyere for some producers.",
