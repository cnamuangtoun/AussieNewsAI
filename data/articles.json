(Edwina Pickles)\n\nIn a statement unveiling this year's report, health experts said the data showed an overall improvement in the quality of water at Sydney's beaches.\n\nThis is because there has been less than average rainfall, which can cause more pollution in waterways.\n\nSwimmers are advised not to enter the water when it is raining and for three days after, when contaminants and debris still could remain.\n\n\"This year we have seen a great result, and we will be continuing to work hand-in-hand with councils to ensure the program continues to serve the community,\" NSW Climate Change and Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said.",

        "text": "A majority of Victorian renters have experienced a \"significant tenancy issue\", yet only half of them made a complaint due to fears of landlord retaliation, a new report based on a survey of 1,000 renters has found.\n\nThe survey by the Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC) found 79 per cent of renters in Victoria had faced at least one problem in the past 12 months.\n\nThe most common issues were delays to repairs and maintenance, \"unreasonable\" rent increases and excessive photos and videos being taken during inspections.\n\nBut only 52 per cent of the affected households lodged a complaint, and even fewer \u2014 just 2 per cent \u2014 escalated their complaint to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).\n\nChandni Gupta says renters often don't feel safe or supported to use legal protections. (Supplied)\n\n\"What we saw is that there is a broader challenge that even where legal protections exist, renters may not feel safe or supported to use them,\" CPRC deputy chief executive Chandni Gupta said.\n\n\" There's a real fear of retaliation and not wanting to rock the boat. \"\n\nThe policy research centre used state government active bonds data and Australian Bureau of Statistics data to build a survey sample of 1,000 Victorian renters.\n\nIts report found two in five of those experiencing rental issues ultimately stayed silent or gave up on seeking recourse, despite more than two thirds overall believing the properties they were currently living in did not meet minimum rental standards.\n\nThere are about 1.5 million renters in Victoria. (ABC News: Jack Ailwood)\n\nJust 16 per cent had high confidence in the rental market, indicating they had no major tenancy issues.\n\nThe findings come as the independent think tank prepares to launch Australia's first Renter Confidence Index at Victoria's Parliament, in the hope that systematic and regular feedback from renters will provide insights into the effectiveness of rental market regulations.\n\nPower imbalance between landlords, renters 'out of whack'\n\nRichmond resident Madeline Cooper said it took eight months and a threat to take her landlord to VCAT for her rental's collapsed ceiling to be fixed.\n\nShe says there were also multiple roof leaks and rotting window frames across the property.\n\nDespite being aware of her rights, Ms Cooper said she was was conscious of the fact that she could not afford to move house.\n\nMadeline Cooper was forced to live for months with a collapsed ceiling in her Richmond rental. (Supplied)\n\n\"There's this constant balance of \"Is this issue bad enough to raise with a landlord?\" in the fear you are going to get a big rent increase, or a no-cause eviction,\" Ms Cooper said.\n\nAfter experiencing multiple issues at other rental properties \u2014 including living with termites, and the need for a tetanus shot after stepping on a nail from a broken fence \u2014 Ms Cooper has publicly campaigned state and federal governments for better rental standards, arguing the \"power imbalance\" between landlords and renters is \"out of whack\".\n\nThe CPRC's survey found Victorian renters were commonly asked to provide \"deeply inappropriate\" information, with 36 per cent of respondents reporting being asked to supply full bank statements during the rental application process.\n\nAnother 15 per cent said they were questioned about their relationship status, sexual orientation, or cultural background.\n\nDelays to repairs and maintenance were found to be some of the most common issues for renters in Victoria. (Supplied)\n\nIn March, the Victorian government passed new rental protection laws, including banning no-fault evictions, stopping rental bidding and increasing the notice period for rental increases to give renters more time to vacate.\n\nBut Ms Cooper said the onus continued to fall to renters to know the underlying legal framework.\n\n\"Renters shouldn't have to be legal experts and know every line of tenancy law to live in safe and stable homes,\" she said.\n\nMadeline Cooper says renters shouldn't have to be legal experts to enforce legislation. (Supplied)\n\nThe state government recently launched a new tribunal, Rental Dispute Resolution Victoria, in a bid to provide renters with a quicker and cheaper alternative to VCAT.\n\nThe CPRC will launch its index on Wednesday alongside Victoria's Minister for Consumer Affairs.\n\nThe body hopes the index will be updated at least every two years to provide timely insights into Victoria's rental market, and eventually be introduced across the country.\n\n\"What's ultimately important is measuring how those reforms are going, and how people are faring,\" Ms Gupta said.\n\n\"What we want to see is a safer, fairer, inclusive rental ecosystem.\"",

The pair will face court in Brisbane next month.\n\nMultiple states have launched crackdowns on the practice in recent years, with maximum penalties ranging from $50,000 to $200,000.\n\nAlexander Hallett was fined $25,000 for odometer fraud at used-car dealerships he operated.

(AAP: Paul Miller)\n\nShe said current punishments were inadequate and people caught winding back the clock should be forced to pay compensation.\n\nExperts said buyers should also review a used car's log books and service history, which creates a \"paper trail\" for odometer readings, and ask questions if those documents were not available.\n\nMotoring journalist Paul Gover said while tampering was often difficult to prove, if buyers had suspicions, it was better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\"Like everything in life, if it seems to good too be true, it probably is,\" he said.\n\n\"If you have got alarm bells ringing, just walk away.\"",

(Commons: Foobar; Gallium crystals; licence)\n\nAlcoa's funding will go towards developing a gallium refinery in Wagerup, about 120 kilometres south of Perth.\n\nThe company has mined among the world's only jarrah forests in WA since the 1960s, and has two expansion proposals before the state's Environment Protection Authority (EPA).\n\nEPA chair Darren Walsh said gallium processing and extraction were not part of the Alcoa assessments currently before the authority.\n\n'Alcoa is here to stay'\n\nUniversity of Western Australia associate professor Kirsten Martinus said the funding deal cemented Alcoa's presence in WA.\n\n\"I think their presence may have been a bit shaky before because there's been a lot of talk around the shutting down of refineries, and because of their environmental track record,\" Dr Martinus said.\n\nThe EPA has received almost 60,000 public submissions related to Alcoa's proposal to expand its operations. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\"The fact that Alcoa is the first one off the rank cements the fact that Alcoa is here to stay.\"\n\nThe EPA received a record 59,000 public submissions regarding Alcoa's proposal to expand its mining operations.\n\nThe company has faced local backlash due to water safety concerns, impacts on at-risk species, and issues with rehabilitating the forest it mines.\n\nIn a statement, Alcoa COO Matt Reed said the gallium project was unrelated to the EPA's assessment and the company was committed to \"responsibly mining bauxite\" used to create alumina and gallium.\n\n\"Regarding the workforce at the Kwinana refinery, our people are our number one priority, as we believe we've demonstrated throughout the curtailment process,\" he said.\n\nTiming questioned\n\nHow we use critical minerals Rare earths are found all over the globe, but as technology advances they're becoming part of our everyday lives.\n\nWaroona Shire president Mike Walmsley said it was strange timing for Alcoa to receive funding for its Wagerup refinery, as the project could hinge on the outcome of the EPA's review.\n\n\"I don't think there will be a halt to [Alcoa's operations] entirely, but there may be some more stringent conditions around their operations in the Northern Jarrah Forest,\" he said.\n\n\"I guess it adds weight to their business case if they're getting more minerals out of it, and the economic development that it brings perhaps adds weight to the ability to keep doing what they're doing.\"\n\nAlcoa's mining footprint in WA between 1984 and 2022.

And even recently, we've had several refineries shut down,\" she said.\n\nAlbanese and Trump ink deal for 'dominance' of critical minerals Donald Trump and Anthony Albanese have inked a deal for \"critical mineral and energy dominance\" in a new partnership that will tip billions into mining projects in the US and Australia.\n\n\"But it's really important that we're not just selling our minerals offshore, and so the opportunity to process and to do refining is a really key step in terms of diversification.\"\n\nDr Martinus said it was important that benefits to projects in WA flowed on to Western Australians.\n\n\"If you've got development of intellectual property, which will happen because you're going into new refining processes, that will be kept by the company,\" she said.\n\n\"If that's Alcoa, then that obviously enriches an American company and not the Australian companies.\n\n\" We're looking at supporting Australia in building sovereign capability, so it shouldn't just be for the purposes of the global critical mineral demand. \"\n\nThe Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia's director of policy and advocacy, Anita Logiudice, hoped local economies would benefit.\n\n\"This [agreement] sends a really strong signal that the US government and possibly other partners are willing to enter into contracts containing floor prices above current market value,\" she said.\n\n\"That money then flows into those local economies and communities and continues to flow throughout the WA economy.\"",

(ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nBut just hours later, Environment Minister Josh Burgoyne told parliament Mr Vogel would step aside for the duration of the investigation.\n\nIn August, the ABC reported a major methane leak at Santos's Darwin LNG export hub had been kept secret from the public for almost 20 years \u2014 and Mr Vogel had been involved in key decisions while working with a lobbyist for the project's co-owner.\n\nThe lobbying firm also previously represented Inpex.\n\nMr Vogel has denied any conflict of interest.\n\nCalls for 'serious and real' consequences\n\nIn its statement, Inpex said air quality monitoring in the Darwin region \"has consistently shown emissions levels are well within government guidelines\".\n\nAcross Darwin and Palmerston there are three sites that monitor air quality. However, they do not detect volatile organic compounds \u2014 the colourless chemicals, including benzene, that are emitted as a by-product from the gas extraction process.\n\nGreens MLA Kat Macnamara said Inpex's error had not only raised fresh questions about transparency but also cast light on the \"glaring hole\" in the NT's regulations and oversight.\n\nKat McNamara says the error is highly concerning and has called for \"serious\" consequences. (ABC News: Peter Garnish)\n\n\"To see scandal after scandal, incident after incident from all these massive, many of them overseas, corporations, gas companies that can just flagrantly break the rules here ... poison our air and water with zero repercussions,\" they said.\n\n\"It's a national crisis.\"\n\nThey said while they do \"not have confidence in this government or anybody that fails to regulate an industry that is doing the wrong thing again and again,\" the public deserves to know \"what's in our air and ... and what's being done about it\".\n\n\"The consequences should be serious and real,\" they said.\n\nThe ABC reached out to Inpex, which declined to comment until after the board meeting.\n\nThe NT EPA was also sent detailed questions, but the ABC did not get a response in time for publication.",

        "text": "A twice-bankrupt Australian who styles himself as an 'admiral' managed to secure talks with Fiji's now-Prime Minister to seek backing for a \"bogus\" international rescue fleet, the ABC can reveal.\n\nNew South Wales man Peter Cowell, who poses in 'admiral' whites, claimed to have raised hundreds of millions in funding, but has never served in the navy and has left would-be supporters claiming they have lost thousands of dollars.\n\nDo you know more about this or have a similar story? Email turner-cohen.alex@abc.net.au\n\nMr Cowell in one of his 'admiral' uniforms. (Supplied: LinkedIn)\n\nMr Cowell did, however, briefly serve in the Army Reserves \u2014 but only on weekends.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who did not respond to requests for comment, has been peddling a \"mercy ship\" scheme called IntSAR, or International Sea/Air Rescue, for the past quarter of a century.\n\nIntSAR was pitched as a 14-fleet maritime aid force, which would be headquartered in an island nation and render help to those in need.\n\nMr Cowell's whereabouts are unknown but he is believed to be in Thailand or Western Australia.\n\nAttending a meeting are (from left) Retired Colonel Sakiusa Raivoce, Joel, Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, Peter Cowell and Fijian High Commissioner Ajay Amrit. (Supplied. )\n\nCowell had a meeting with the future leader of Fiji at My Kai, a restaurant in Suva. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell got into a room with one of Australia's most important diplomatic partners in 2022, meeting with then Fijian opposition leader Sitiveni Rabuka, who went on to become the country's prime minister.\n\nTwo other Fijians attended the meeting \u2014 Ajay Amrit, the High Commissioner for Fiji in Canberra, and retired Colonel Sakiusa Raivoce, a founder of Fiji's People's Alliance Party.\n\nAnother IntSAR representative, Joel, who did not wish to use his real name as he works as a defence contractor, also attended the lunch.\n\nThey discussed establishing a base of operations for a fleet of mercy ships in the region, according to Joel, who was involved intimately with IntSAR for four years before growing disillusioned.\n\nAlthough IntSAR required an annual $25 million \"donation\" from \"member nations\", the understanding was this would be waived if Fiji provided it with crown land to set up its headquarters.\n\nMr Cowell planned to turn a parcel of land in Suva, Fiji, into IntSAR's base. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell's plans included multiple locations. (Supplied. )\n\n\"We did this pitch to a lot of people, really,\" Joel said.\n\n\" The closest it got was when we actually had engaged with a potential head of state. \"\n\nThe meeting ended on a good note, according to Joel, although no promises were made.\n\nDespite this, Mr Cowell secured another meeting in March 2023 after Mr Rabuka took power.\n\n\"Admiral\" Peter Cowell has never served in the navy. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell has been wearing admiral uniforms with IntSAR insignia. (Supplied)\n\n'Initiate the IntSAR program'\n\nA letter the ABC has independently verified reveals the Fijian government arranged a second meeting with Mr Cowell after Mr Rabuka's election.\n\n\"We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4 January 2023 to meet the Prime Minister to initiate the IntSAR program,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The Prime Minister has agreed to meet with the Admiralty delegation on Thursday 16 March 2023 at 1100 hours at the Office of the Prime Minister, level 4, Government Buildings, Suva.\"\n\nThe ABC understands the meeting never went ahead as Mr Cowell was by that point living in Thailand and could not afford a ticket back to Fiji.\n\nMr Rabuka refused an interview with the ABC and did not address a detailed list of questions, including about plans to initiate IntSAR and whether any due diligence checks had been carried out, but he confirmed in a statement that he attended one meeting with Mr Cowell.\n\n\"I recall attending a meeting in Fiji around 2022 with a delegation from Australia regarding a proposal to establish a search and rescue operation in Fiji,\" Mr Rabuka said.\n\n\" However, nothing concrete resulted from that discussion \u2014 no agreement was signed, and neither were any funds or land handed over, or promised. \"\n\nMr Cowell planned for IntSAR to have a fleet of ships and planes. (Supplied)\n\nPeter Cowell lived in Queanbeyan, near Canberra, for several years. (Supplied: LinkedIn)\n\nMr Cowell also tried to get interest from the Federal Coalition government in 2021, writing a brief on the project, though it is not clear if it was received.\n\nThe brief claimed IntSAR had already obtained $800 million of funding from 30 member nations.\n\nThe aim was to have 150 member nations, which would bring its annual budget to $3.75 billion, according to the briefing Mr Cowell authored.\n\n\"We request that the Morrison Government as a cabinet fully support this diplomatic initiative as the Primary Diplomatic Sponsor Nation and Host to the IntSAR Commission,\" the brief read.\n\nIf the government did this, \"we would happily support Australia taking the credit for the initiative\", Mr Cowell added.\n\nIt would be run by an \"admiralty\" board, with Mr Cowell at the helm.\n\nMr Cowell is the self-appointed admiral of a phantom fleet of rescue ships. (Supplied)\n\nCowell proposed to turn land in Bathurst into an international private airport for IntSAR. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell also tried to pitch IntSAR to other Australian government bodies.\n\nIn 2020, IntSAR proposed turning an empty parcel of land at the Bathurst airport, in central NSW, into a private airport and flight training facility.\n\n\"It is the expectation that this activity be fully supported by the Bathurst Regional Council, as it is in the best interest of the local community,\" a proposal read.\n\nThe council confirmed they had \"received an approach\" from IntSAR.\n\n\"Representatives from the group spoke with council regarding the project,\" general manager David Sherley said in a statement.\n\n\"Council has had no contact from IntSAR since mid-2021.\"\n\nCowell attempted to recruit Peter Hogan and Scott Rogan to IntSAR. (ABC News: Warwick Ford)\n\nFormer NSW Police detectives Scott Rogan and Peter Hogan met Mr Cowell at the Bathurst airport where he revealed his plans for the empty land.\n\nMr Hogan was offered the title of Captain Director of IntSAR Justice, for $US190,000 a year, plus 22 per cent superannuation.\n\n\"I think I'll just frame it because I won't see the size of that contract in my life again,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\nBut both detectives had suspicions and decided not to pursue jobs there.\n\nMr Rogan said he heard \"a lot of Thunderbird jokes\" when he first learned of IntSAR's concept, referencing the popular 1960s TV show.\n\nAnd hearing about IntSAR's \"diplomatic manoeuvring\", he said he \"wasn't seeing it out of a shed essentially in Bathurst\".\n\n\"There were a few things that just didn't feel quite right about it all,\" recalled Mr Rogan, calling the operation \"fake\" and \"bogus\".\n\nScheme collapses\n\nAn independent UK podcaster, Sarah Ferris, approached the detectives last year for more information and they have been helping her investigation ever since.\n\nShortly after they started investigating the scheme, IntSAR imploded.\n\nSarah Ferris says Mr Cowell falsely told people she was a vindictive ex-girlfriend. (Supplied)\n\nMs Ferris, host of 'The Badmiral' podcast, began investigating Mr Cowell right after the Fijian meetings and initially feared he had obtained $25 million from them as a donation.\n\nAs well as having no naval background, there is no record of the degrees in counter terrorism and law enforcement Mr Cowell has claimed at Murdoch University.\n\nMs Ferris alerted IntSAR's volunteers that the admiral \"might not be who you think he is\",\n\n\"It was all built on sand,\" she said.\n\nThis prompted a \"mutiny\", where Mr Cowell was ousted, the website shut down and most of its 38 members distanced themselves from the project.\n\nJoel claims he lost tens of thousands of dollars by giving Mr Cowell money when he asked. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell has been trying to get IntSAR off the ground for decades. (Supplied)\n\nJoel, one of IntSAR's biggest supporters, is among those who grew disillusioned with the scheme following its implosion.\n\nHe claims he is owed more than $30,000, having paid for flights and accommodation for the Fiji meeting.\n\nMr Cowell then continued to ask him for money afterwards, he said.\n\n\"After that, it was just a constant stream of, 'I need another few grand here', 'I need another $100 there',\" Joel said.\n\n\"And [it got] to the point where I just said, 'No, enough's enough. I need to see something.' And then he vanished.\"\n\nPart of that money made up a loan he advanced to Mr Cowell to buy a ticket to Thailand from Fiji.\n\nJoel never saw him again.\n\n\"He took advantage of my good nature,\" Joel said.\n\nMr Cowell told a 2021 Zoom meeting he was an admiral by political appointment. (Supplied)\n\nIntSAR's ranking system, which one person said looked too similar to that of the Royal Australian Navy. (Supplied)\n\nThe ABC has obtained a video where Mr Cowell acknowledged to a room full of military personnel in 2021 he had never served in the navy, and had been \"politically appointed\" to the admiral role.\n\nIn a recorded Zoom call, which was attended by former Australian army and air force officers, and even a retired US admiral, Mr Cowell said he made the disclosure \"in the interests and intent of full clarity and transparency\".\n\n\" A couple of the Admiralty have mentioned that they are aware that I, Admiral Peter Cowell, have not served in a naval capacity, but that my appointment is strictly a political one. \"\n\nNo-one challenged Mr Cowell, several nodded along, and the meeting carried on for another half hour.\n\nWho politically appointed him is unclear.\n\nIn Australia, there is no such thing as an admiral by political appointment.\n\nAt most there is one admiral at any time in Australia, who can only get the title if they are promoted from Chief of Navy to Chief of the Defence Force.\n\nMr Cowell does not appear to have expressly claimed to have served in the Australian Navy, instead describing himself as an admiral \"with IntSAR\".\n\nSimilarly, the uniforms he frequently wore bore IntSAR, rather than Australian Navy, insignia.\n\nHowever, a number of people spoken to by the ABC expressed concern that the title and uniforms could mislead people.\n\nMr Cowell dressed in his admiral uniform at a bar in Thailand. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell was in Thailand as recently as last year. (Supplied)\n\nStolen valour\n\nSpeaking generally, an Australian Federal Police spokesperson said there were a number of offences under Commonwealth legislation that related to \"stolen valour\", which was where misrepresentations were made in relation to military rank and achievements.\n\nSome carry a maximum of six months imprisonment, or a $9,900 fine.\n\nIn NSW, the statute of limitation for such an offence is only six months.\n\nRSL Australia said in a statement it \"deplores anyone falsely claiming military ranks, titles, awards and decorations, or making false claims of military service\" and that such claims should be reported to the relevant authorities.\n\nMr Cowell in Thailand. (Supplied)\n\nMr Cowell appears to have served in the army reserves when he was younger. (Supplied: LinkedIn)\n\nPast bankruptcies\n\nMr Cowell has a colourful past, with arrests and bankruptcies stretching back to the 1990s.\n\nIn 2000, a company called IntSAR was registered, but Mr Cowell could not be its director as he was made bankrupt in 1999, following another bankruptcy stint in 1991.\n\nRecords from his 1999 bankruptcy reveal he used the alias Steven Samual Davidson for three months.\n\nCreditors forced Mr Cowell into bankruptcy over a $6,900 debt, and he had just $8 left in his bank account.\n\nHe listed himself as a pensioner and security guard, and said he had been unemployed for more than two years.\n\nIn 2004, Mr Cowell became a director of IntSAR, after being discharged from bankruptcy, and moved to Kingsley Park in Perth, bringing the organisation with him.\n\nMr Cowell sells video ads online. (Supplied)\n\nBy 2006, the first iteration of IntSAR had shut down.\n\nRecords on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) showed that Paul Grant, a co-director of IntSAR in its early days, said the company's position was \"untenable\".\n\nMr Grant felt compelled to resign as a co-director because Mr Cowell had left the organisation with a $30,000 debt.\n\n\"He paid the wages and didn't pay the ute rental and the debt had been growing,\" Mr Grant said when the ABC tracked him down. He has not been involved with IntSAR for some years.\n\nMr Cowell is advertising that he has anti-organised crime, national security and asymmetric industrial relations experience. (Supplied: YouTube)\n\nMr Cowell has been promoting a new video angel investing scheme. (Supplied)\n\nWhere is 'the admiral' now?\n\nSince the collapse of IntSAR, Mr Cowell has dropped his admiral honorific and has been trying to sell angel investing schemes, Thai real estate, books and ad products.\n\nIn December 2023, Mr Cowell posted a video promoting a one-bedroom condo in Jomtien, Thailand, a beach town located a few kilometres from popular tourist destination Pattaya.\n\nThat same month, he released another video asking for \"financial assistance\" to fund him writing three books, including a romance novel called Latin Fire.\n\nAround the same time, he tried to attract customers for low cost, \"high quality video adds\", with \"ads\" misspelt.\n\nLoading...\n\nMr Cowell's most recent video is from July last year, speaking from Bangkok, Thailand, spruiking an angel investors video verified group.\n\n\"What makes us special is \u2026 every profile in our group must be video-verified,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed the investment opportunity \u2014 of which its exact nature is unclear \u2014 had only existed for two weeks and that he had already secured an investor.\n\nThe ABC made several attempts to contact Mr Cowell but did not hear back.",

Got it Share\n\nThere was a time when the cartoon version of cruising involved someone on the pool deck enjoying a fruity drink topped by a cherry and pink cocktail umbrella. It didn\u2019t matter about the quality of the spirits in the drink, since all you could taste was pineapple and coconut juice. Your most difficult choice was between rum or vodka. Now it\u2019s more likely to be happy days than happy hours, with cruise lines offering far more sophisticated drinks, and with far more choice of labels. Scenic\u2019s ocean ships are the perfect example: they carry 100 premium wines and 130 whisky labels. Whisky at the bar on Scenic Eclipse. Not only that, but guest interaction with invited wine experts and celebrity mixologists has become common, and so, too, have speciality bars on cruise ships. If you want to indulge in interesting drinks at sea, there\u2019s never been a better time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is win-win. Collaborations with premium alcohol brands add pizzazz to cruise brands, and sourcing drinks from small producers results in a better profit margin. Passengers are pleased because the wider trend towards boutique beverages on land has created an appreciation of niche beers, wines and spirits, and our palates have become more demanding. Scenic Bar on Scenic Eclipse. The trend has been around a while. In 2016, for example, Carnival Cruise Line was first to launch an on-board brewery, RedFrog, which now appears on several ships. Carnival Cruise Line has a decade-long relationship with Sydney\u2019s Lord Nelson Brewery and a more recent one with Aussie gin producer Four Pillars. Norwegian Cruise Line has its own-label gin, pilsner and prosecco, and Royal Caribbean its Chilla Thrilla tropical ale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJazz bar on Carnival\u2019s Mardi Gras. But the tipping point seems to have been in 2023, which saw several companies launch exclusive spirits to celebrate anniversaries, new ship launches, or just because they could. Related Article Cruises Our expert on the cruise restaurant that\u2019s \u2018refreshingly different\u2019 For Holland America, it was a special De Lijn gin, and for new company Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, premium rum Candela Mamajuana from the Dominican Republic. Cunard produced a special-edition gin for the launch of new ship Queen Anne under its Cunard 4 Queens gin range. Oceania broke open an exclusive 20-year-old cask whisky by Chapter 7. It also started rum and whisky programs on its ships, which include mixology classes and chocolate and tea pairings with The Macallan, one of the world\u2019s most expensive malt whiskies, and Brugal 1888 Doblemente Anejado rum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year Princess Cruises added MEILI vodka, created by actor Jason Momoa, to its range of one-of-a-kind spirits from well-known personalities, such as tequila by Matthew McConaughey, Irish whiskey by Liev Schreiber, and a non-alcoholic sparkling ros\u00e9 by Kylie Minogue. The trend towards more focused on-board bars is growing too. MSC\u2019s just-launched ship MSC World America features three of them. Elixy Bar specialises in bourbon and bourbon-based cocktails, The Gin Project focuses on American and Canadian gins, and a British-style pub features its own microbrewery.

Got it Share\n\nThe hotel Al Moudira Hotel, Luxor West Bank, Egypt Grand designs\u2026 Moudira Hotel. Check-in Al Moudira is the female version of the Arabic ya moudira, \u201cthe manager\u201d, but here it means \u201cthe lady boss\u201d, a reference to Italian-Lebanese designer Zeina Aboukheir who stopped by on a felucca more than two decades ago, was taken by the timeless tranquillity of the area just upstream from the Valley of the Kings and decided to build a luxury resort hotel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo ordinary reception. A renowned Egyptian architect and local village craftsmen were harnessed to bring her vision to fruition, a fusion of the architecture and design elements of a traditional Egyptian noble house with the amenities of a glamorous luxury hotel. Aboukheir describes it as a \u201cmix of Lebanese, Syrian and Turkish influences, with Italian colours\u201d. This is the only Egyptian hotel to wear the gold crown of the prestigious Relais & Chateaux association. The look Fountain Suite. It\u2019s a transportive experience. From the dusty rural world outside, you enter a stylised rendering of an Egyptian palace, complete with scalloped arches, domed ceilings, splashing fountains and sandy hued walls. Aboukheir set the tone for her desert resort, travelling the Middle East and rescuing handcrafted wooden doors, marble tiles, terracotta, painted glass and unwanted fountains from Ottoman-era villas in Alexandria and Cairo with demolition notices on the front door. The 54 rooms are clustered around courtyards with fountains and sunken tiled pools accented with sprays of bougainvillea. The swimming pool, ringed by date palms, is large enough for laps, while the spa blends the bathing rituals of the hammam with modern wellness practices. Daily yoga sessions with an Indian master are included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe room You can\u2019t be anywhere else than Egypt... luxury suite. The base-level deluxe suites are a whopping 50-55 square metres, with an enormous king-sized bed or supersize twins, antiques and a coffee machine. Walls are hand-painted by the hotel\u2019s resident artist. Mine features a felucca on the Nile with palm trees in the foreground. Bed linen, including the pretty embroidered pillowcases, is by Malaika Cairo, a name to conjure with in Egypt\u2019s style manual. In the bathrooms, coloured glass insets paint the walls with gold and cherry-blossom pink. Move up a notch to the signature suites, and you get more of everything \u2013 space, a four-poster wrought-iron bed, private terrace and a cavernous bathroom. Scattered about the property, the five-bedroom villas come with a private pool within a cloistered garden, a butler and a chef on call. Food + drink The elegant Ottoman Hall serves a dinner menu that fuses Italian and Middle Eastern flavours with falafel, freekeh and couscous alongside pasta dishes, duck confit with an orange and thyme sauce, and lemon risotto with parmigiano reggiano. The same dinner menu is available in the sunken courtyard, where marble-topped tables and wrought iron chairs are set against a backdrop of pink walls and palm trees. By day, the courtyard serves breakfast, lunch and cafe-style snacks. Khan Al Moudira is the hotel\u2019s casual, Middle Eastern restaurant, with a nod to the coffee houses of Ottoman Cairo. Much of the produce, including eggs, butter, milk, yoghurt, poultry, vegetables and wheat products, comes from Al Moudira\u2019s own farm, adjoining the hotel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOut + about Hot-air balloon rides over the Nile River and Valley of Kings. Getty Images While most of Luxor\u2019s hotels are on the busy East Bank of the Nile, Al Moudira sits alone on the West Bank, in a rural idyll surrounded by sugarcane fields. Some of Egypt\u2019s most iconic treasures, including the Valley of the Kings, the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut and the temples at Karnak and Luxor are a 15-minute drive away. Hot-air balloon rides, visits to local artisans and sunset felucca cruises are some of the optional activities. Bicycles are provided. The verdict It\u2019s calm, relaxing and invigorating. Service is skilled and professional, and Al Moudira never lets you forget you\u2019re in a special part of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHighlight The bed linen, Egyptian cotton, must have a magic ingredient.

        "text": "There\u2019s also the \u201cdebasement\u201d trade, with investors reducing their holdings of sovereign debt and exposures to fiat currencies because they fear heir value will erode as the US and other overly indebted governments are eventually forced to tackle their debt burdens by printing more money. That\u2019s another macro reason to buy gold. Loading At a more micro level, falling interest rates in the US \u2013 even with the inflation rate edging up as the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs starts to flow through \u2013 have been a factor in the sell-off of the dollar. Gold generates no income but for traders carries both holding and opportunity costs. The slide in US rates \u2013 from mid-January the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond has tumbled from 4.78 per cent to 3.96 per cent \u2013 has helped reduce those costs of holding gold, while the inflation rate has, thanks largely to Trump\u2019s tariffs, jumped from 2.3 per cent in April to 2.9 per cent in August. Inflation data for September has been delayed by America\u2019s government shutdown, but is expected to be released on Friday. Market forecasts are for another rise to 3.1 per cent, which would normally be a positive for the gold price, given bullion\u2019s perceived role as a hedge against inflation.\n\nThere are, however, other developments looming that will overshadow the release of the inflation data. Next week, the Federal Reserve Board meets amid expectations that it will cut its policy rate for the second time this year, although that isn\u2019t a given, particularly if inflation is higher than expected. Perhaps of greater significance, there is also a scheduled meeting of Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, which starts on Tuesday. Trump\u2019s initial response to China\u2019s announcement of tightened controls over exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets was to angrily threaten 100 per cent tariffs on all US imports from China.\n\nAlmost immediately, however, he backed away, adopted a conciliatory tone and started talking about the \u201creally great\u201d deal \u2013 \u201cfantastic for both countries, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world\u201d \u2013 that he hopes to negotiate with Xi. China\u2019s dominance of rare earths, vital for most advanced manufacturing and weapons, means that Xi enters any trade discussion with Trump holding by far the more potent hand, regardless of Trump\u2019s bombastic talk of America\u2019s strengths. The optimistic prospect of a trade deal that defuses the tensions between the world\u2019s two key economies is a negative for the gold price. Gold thrives in environments where there is fear, uncertainty and volatility. It is instructive that Wall Street\u2019s so-called \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 the VIX index \u2013 which measures market volatility, spiked in response to China\u2019s new rare earths export rules and what appeared to be an abrupt rise in trade tensions, before subsiding when Trump started making more placatory noises.\n\nAnother possible ingredient in the mix that helped trigger the steep gold price fall is the fallout from the US government shutdown, which has impacted more than just the inflation data. Loading With a lot of economic and financial data not being collected because workers have been furloughed and agencies effectively closed, commodity traders have lost access to the weekly report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that provides them with insights into how hedge funds and other institutional investors are positioned in gold and silver futures. They are operating within an information vacuum, which tends to make investors nervous and defensive. Given how far and how fast gold and silver prices had run up \u2013 the gold price jumped about $US1000 an ounce in less than two months \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that some traders decided to reduce their exposure. Having said that, the fundamentals for gold and other precious metals remain solid.\n\nWhile the global economy has held up better than expected in the face of Trump\u2019s trade wars, their full impact won\u2019t be seen until next year. Loading US and global debt levels remain extremely high and are still rising. Geopolitical tensions may or may not wane, but they won\u2019t disappear. Central banks will continue to increase their gold holdings as a strategy for diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets, and they and their governments will also look for new trading partners and new currencies for trade after Trump has made it clear that historic relationships and institutions no longer matter to the US.",

Michael M Grynbaum, a media reporter for The New York Times , now takes some of its shine off in his robust retelling of the making \u2013 and unmaking \u2013 of the magazine empire.\n\nIf you had recognised these three names, you would have been one step closer to working at Vogue in the 1990s. These public figures were listed on a set of typed pages that candidates had to identify during an interview with the storied fashion magazine.\n\nWith publications like The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and GQ, the company once wielded unparalleled cultural influence. \u201cFor decades, one company \u2026 told the world what to buy, what to value, what to wear, what to eat, even what to think,\u201d Grynbaum writes. But in the past two decades, the internet and social media has eroded the power of print media and democratised taste-masking. Influencers now exert greater sway than magazines.\n\nThe company started at the turn of the 20th century when the namesake Cond\u00e9 Montrose Nast began building his stable of publications. In 1909, he made a savvy move in acquiring Vogue \u2013 a fashion magazine for old-money readership \u2013 and reoriented its message as \u201cinclusive exclusivity\u201d to the middle class. Like its later incarnation, Vogue became a major \u201cglobal tastemaker\u201d.\n\nAnna Wintour, a former Vogue editor and global chief content office of Cond\u00e9 Nast. Credit: AP\n\nNast\u2019s publications, like House & Garden and Vanity Fair, would enjoy a heyday until the 1940s. After the end of World War II, readers turned away from these periodicals to more moderate outlets such as TIME and Reader\u2019s Digest. Samuel Newhouse, a media baron making his fortune in newspapers, acquired the Cond\u00e9 Nast titles during the decline, and later split his media assets between his two children.\n\nNewhouse\u2019s younger son, Samuel Irving \u201cSi\u201d Jr., took the temperature of changing attitudes in 1980s America and chose to embrace the excess and opulence of the decade. Vanity Fair, GQ and Vogue would glorify a luxurious lifestyle, pushing refined taste, style and fashion in an era defined by conspicuous consumption and self-obsession.",

And the U-N's image today is too often one is falling short, and there are many reasons for that. Confidence is being undermined across all three pillars of the charter, peace and security, development and human rights. In some the world is becoming less equal, more unstable and more dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallaher has announced the government will be updating its threshold of government contracts to provide what she calls preferential procurement opportunities to Australian businesses.\n\n\n\nThe threshold for contracts to be forced to open tender will increase from $80,000 to $125,000, and up to $7.5 million for construction work, in a move to maximise businesses' opportunities.\n\n\n\n\"The government wants to engage with Australian businesses, with small and medium enterprises, we want to be a good purchaser across the ecosystem but also allow businesses to really promote what they have to provide to the commonwealth government to us with some changes through the supplier portal.\"\n\n\n\nShe says each year up until now the government has spent about $70 billion dollars from the Commonwealth coffers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government says the new US-Australia critical minerals deal will comply with Australia's environment laws.\n\n\n\nUnder the deal*, both nations will invest US$1 billion over the next six months to help accelerate the delivery of critical mineral projects, with a joint commitment to fast-track approvals.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS, a spokesperson for Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt has said all projects that could potentially impact matters of national significance are required to comply with national environment law.\n\n\n\nGreens Foreign Affairs spokesperson David Shoebridge says there should be steps taken to ensure the environment laws are not bypassed in the move to fast-track approvals.\n\n\n\n\"These responses leave more questions than answers. There is a real concern that if the arbitrary US timeframes for development of critical minerals and rare earth projects are going to be met then the Albanese government may already be intending to abuse existing \u2018national security\u2019 loopholes that can bypass federal, state and territory environmental laws.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew data shows Australians experiencing homelessness are more likely to die from overdose, suicide or coronary heart disease, with potentially nine avoidable deaths every day.\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that around 43,200 people with a history of homelessness died between 2012 and 2013 alone from these types of causes.\n\n\n\nThe median age was 55 years, far lower than the Australian median life expectancy of 81.1 years for men and 85.1 years for women.\n\n\n\nFor women, gendered violence remains a leading cause of homelessness across Australia, impacting almost 67,000 people every year.\n\n\n\nAnd if this story has raised issues for you or someone you know, you can get support from 1800 RESPECT at 1800 737 732, Lifeline on 13-11-14, Men's Referral Service 1300 766 491 and beyondblue on 1300 22 4636\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in sport,\n\n\n\nMinjee Lee and Hannah Green will lead as Australia's women's golf stars bid to win the prestigious International Crown teams' event for a first time.\n\n\n\nWith Lee, Green, and 2025 major winner Grace Kim, and Steph Kyriacou forming a formidable team, Australia are seeded fourth for the biennial match play event in South Korea.\n\n",

A particular type of immune cell called a CDN 8 T cell - what we found was that breastfeeding is able to train those T cells to become good at patrolling the breast tissue, detecting any cells that are beginning to turn cancerous, and then eliminating them before that can happen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the research, these T cells appear to be most effective against triple negative breast cancer, which accounts for about 15 per cent of all breast cancers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centre's Professor Sherene Loi says it's also the most common in women under 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It unfortunately is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, and traditionally we have treated it with chemotherapy as well as surgery. But we also do immunotherapy as part of the treatment. But this tells us that the immune system is important in triple negative breast cancer, and by manipulating the immune system or activating the patient's immune system against triple negative breast cancer, we can improve outcomes and reduce risk of recurrence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMother-of-two Stephanie Davy is breastfeeding her baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's reassuring to know breastfeeding is not only benefitting her infant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're really quite focused on your baby and wanting to get it right and do whatever you can, as best you can, for your baby. But yeah, having extra health benefits for yourself, I think, is really quite special.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's hard to say how many other women might also be breastfeeding in Australia, because that information isn't routinely collected and monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Breastfeeding Association chief Victoria Marshall says the existing data indicates women need more support in establishing breastfeeding routines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately we don't have great data about breastfeeding rates in Australia. The Association often refers to the 2010 National Infant Feeding survey data because that was the last robust and high quality survey that was done. We do have some data from Victoria from 2017 to 18. What we know from the National Infant Feeding survey and the Victorian data is that by the time they leave hospital those breastfeeding rates have already gone down to 70 percent, and then by six months they're at 16 to 22 percent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research has also raised questions about women who have never been pregnant or breastfed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Victoria Marshall says there's hope this research will help them too - with the findings potentially used to develop more effective prevention treatments.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Homeowners in flood zones are paying \"a disaster penalty\", with a new report from the Climate Council finding their houses have lost a combined $42.2 billion in value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report from Climate Council and PropTrack, a property data insights firm, found that despite house prices rising across the board, a typical three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in a flood zone is worth $75,000 less than a similar home outside of one.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said the report showed that climate change is already having a \"significant\" impact on house prices in flood zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important for people to understand that these risks are here with us now, and it's already having a material impact on Australians, and that that impact is exacerbating inequality,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep reading to find out if your region is at risk.\n\n\n\nOne in six homes is in a flood zone\n\nOf an estimated 11.7 million homes in Australia, just over two million, or one in six, are at risk of flooding, according to the Climate Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland and NSW were the states most affected, while Tasmania and the ACT were the least impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greatest value drop was in Brisbane, which has been hit by 10 flood events since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report found houses in the flood-prone suburbs of Chelmer and Graceville, close to the Brisbane River, lost 10.6 per cent of their value, or around $303,000.\n\n\n\nIn western Sydney, a house in the adjoining suburbs of Pitt Town and McGraths Hill in the low-lying Hawkesbury catchment is worth $363,500 less than a house with no flood risk. That's a drop of 8.7 per cent in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie said that while house prices may still rise in these regions, they are not growing as fast as houses that don't carry a flood risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Growing house prices have masked the impact on flood-affected homes,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe lure of cheaper homes\n\nAmid a national housing crisis, McKenzie warned that there is no silver lining to climate change pushing house prices down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been asked a lot that, if these houses are worthless, isn't that a good thing?\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, McKenzie said the problem \"compounds inequality\".\n\n\n\nFormer prime minister Scott Morrison inspects a flood-damaged property in Sydney's McGraths Hill in 2022, where property values have since dropped by nearly 9 per cent. Source: AAP / Dean Lewins \"In some of these regions where we've identified the flood risk being really high, they've been inundated multiple times within a five-year period ,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're in a flood risk zone, you find it's harder to insure your house , or you can't insure your house. And so when a catastrophic flood comes, you have far less resilience to that flood event. You potentially can't rebuild your property.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the regions are already lower socioeconomic zones, and McKenzie said people should not be lured by the promise of cheaper homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People can become trapped,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRicher areas not immune\n\nHomes at the waterfront suburb of Mermaid Beach, once one of the most expensive places to buy on the Gold Coast, are valued 7.8 per cent lower due to flood risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was despite only 16 per cent of properties being located in the flood zone. However, events such as ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred , which hit the Gold Coast between February and March this year, contributed to the changing perception of Mermaid Beach.\n\n\n\nA damaged Putt Putt golf course at Mermaid Beach following ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred in early 2025. Source: AAP / Dave Hunt However, the report did find the drop in value was smaller in some of the more prestigious areas. Noosaville and Noosa Heads were two places where coastal vistas and an enviable beach lifestyle outweighed the risk of flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie said this is likely because \"people don't fully appreciate the risks yet\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No matter what demographic the property is in, if your home is flood-affected, it has increased less than others.\"\n\n\n\nWho should pay the penalty?\n\nIn September, the government-commissioned National Climate Risk Assessment found that by 2050, climate change could decrease property values by more than $600 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said this report showed \"the material cost that people are wearing right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie called for changes to planning laws to stop future builds in flood prone areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government will need to buy back houses because it won't be feasible to live in those locations anymore. Those costs should be absorbed by the whole community because people didn't know that that was going to be the risk that they were exposed to.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE No Australians immune: What 2050 and beyond will look like for your city\n\nMcKenzie urged people considering buying in a flood zone to consider the future risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the most important thing is, of course, tackling the climate crisis, accelerating the rollout of renewable energy around the country, so that we can get off coal and gas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This isn't about a moral argument for a better future. I think it's important to communicate to the public and to politicians that this is an economic, material cost being experienced today.\"\n\n\n\n",

Just getting started.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \"That's right. We're doing a real job on rare earth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal comes during a long-awaited meeting between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump has looked to Australia as a suitable alternative to the US's geopolitical rival China which has long dominated global rare earth exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is home to the world's largest deposits of critical minerals which are mined here but mostly exported to and processed in China which controls 90 per cent of global supply chains.\n\n\n\nTania Constable, CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia has declared the deal as a triumph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important that no single country has a monopoly on all of the minerals required for every day use. So this sort of announcement is important to meet a number of countries' needs and Australia is central to that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical minerals are used in everything from smart phones to electric cars, artificial intelligence and weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new deal will see $5 billion dollars of joint investment in the next six months unlock a pipeline of projects\n\n\n\n\"In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths you won't know what to do with them, they'll be worth about 2 dollars.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd shares of rare earth companies have soared in early trade on the Australian Stock Exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcoa's developing a gallium refinery in Western Australia and the Gina Rinehart-backed Arafura Rare Earths near Alice Springs also mines the minerals critical for defence projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Opposition leader Sussan Ley says the Coalition isn't celebrating yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's high level, we'll go through the detail. But we also know if you are a resources company in this country or a company that relies on energy, if you dig anything out of the ground you need cheap, reliable energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor announced a Critical Minerals Reserve back in April and has been in talks with the mining sector since to set price floors so companies don't lose money if they set aside product for the US instead of Australia's typical export partner, China.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Constable from the Minerals Council says it's an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with a key ally while delivering a boost to the Australian economy.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them. They'll be worth about $2. But in the meantime we're working with Australia and other countries. They're working with us too. But other countries also on that. But we're really working on anything having to do with military, military protection, military ships, vehicles, guns, ammunition. Everything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was U-S President Donald Trump, touting the benefits of the AU$13.5 billion dollar critical minerals and rare earths deal signed between Australia and the US during Monday's first official in-person bilateral meeting between Mr Trump and the Australian Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe framework is aimed at securing critical minerals and countering China's control over the global supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese initial commitments include major US investment in building the Alcoa-Sojitz gallium project, a gallium refinery in Western Australia with a capacity of 100 metric tons a year, and a AU$154 million dollar investment in the Arafura Nolans rare earths mine in the Northern Territory. Anthony Albanese clarified how the projects will work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's three groups of projects, ones that are joint activities between Australia and the United States, that's ALCOA. Secondly is projects that will be US investment that the US will undertake in Australia including processing and then ones that Australia will undertake some as well. One of them is Australia, the US and Japan as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the topic of the AUKUS agreement, Mr Trump made a renewed commitment to the AUKUS partnership in a press conference at the White House before the first formal meeting between the pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuring that the AU$368 billion dollar trilateral security deal would go ahead, Mr Trump told reporters that the US had 'no better friend than Australia.'\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if Australia would get relief from trade tariffs, however, Mr. Trump indicated that would not be up for review, noting that Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the US-Australia critical minerals deal aims to counter China's dominance, Foreign Minister Penny Wong was asked on Seven's Sunrise about the potential fallout with Beijing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Wong did not guarantee a smooth path, instead firmly ensuring the deal would be right for Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe act in our national interest, and it's in our national interest to make sure we work with the United States to ensure security of supply of critical minerals. these are so important for the twenty first century economy, they're important for our defense industries, and they're important for energy security, so it is a good thing to work with our ally and partner to assure the supply of critical minerals.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNot everyone was so confident.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australia Institute's Emma Shortis cautioned that although the deal might not fracture ties with China, Australia runs a risk by blurring the line between its own interests and American interests when it comes to Beijing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, look, I think the risk of framing everything as a security and defense issue in binary terms, is that it unnecessarily escalates tensions, you know, and not that's not to understate the nature of those tensions, but I think there are all tensions that can be managed. But when Australia is seen to be in lockstep with the United States and conflating our interests with American interests, I think that exposes Australia to risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was further amplified by the Greens Senator David Shoebridge, who labelled the critical minerals deal a 'deep blow to Australia's independence.'\n\n\n\n\n\nShoebridge also criticized AUKUS, saying these major deals handed the U.S. too much control, resulting in a clear victory for America at Australia's cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAustralia has also handed the United States a veto over development and sales of our own critical minerals, a complete surrender of our industrial independence, and it's no wonder that Donald Trump was smiling today he's got Australia building the United States, an $8 billion submarine base off Perth. He's been gifted $375 billion of Australia's taxpayers money, much of which will flow into the US weapons industry. And he's been given direct access to and a US veto over development of Australia's critical minerals. What's not to smile at, if you're Donald Trump, and of course, it is a deep, deep blow to Australia's independence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor what was mostly smooth sailing, the diplomatic exchange was not without drama.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, a journalist reminded Mr Trump of critical past remarks made by Australia's ambassador Kevin Rudd.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Rudd, who had previously been scathing of the President in a series of now-deleted social media posts, was sitting across the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe President first quipped that \"maybe he'd like to apologise\" before delivering a blunt on-camera response to the Ambassador.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \"Where is he, is he still working for you? You said bad?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRUDD: \"Before I took this position, Mr. President...\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \"I don't like you either. And probably never will.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the cameras were off, the former Prime Minister was reported to have approached President Trump to offer what he called a \"genuine\" apology, which prompted Mr Trump to reply, \"All is forgiven.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I think it is crazy to see that the internet is not as bulletproof as we think.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMale voxie 2: \"We have Lloyd's Bank affected. People's cards are declining. Ring security cameras just aren't working. So people can't even check the security cameras. UK tax website is not working. I know Canva is not working. So people who use that for work - can't do that. It is pretty insane that one outage in the US can take out so many services across the world. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale voxie 1: \"By me being a trader, I was concerned because (US trading platform) Robin Hood and Webull was lagging. And it led me to think, if you really don't have cash in your house - it just shows how fragile the system is. Is everybody going to go back to cash? What are we going to do? Because this is kind of scary.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2,000 companies globally reported connectivity issues, as did 8.1 million users - including 418,000 in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's according to website Downdetector that monitors internet outages.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet users - like Christina - went online looking for help, after her devices that use voice activation failed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I use Alexa-enabled smart plugs to control the lamps in my room. I\u2019m unable to walk without leaning on crutches so being able to turn lights and music on by voice is very helpful. During the outage my smart plugs became unresponsive. Before I realised why the plug wasn\u2019t working, I tried unsuccessfully to reset one of them. Now I can\u2019t get it to work at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReports of connectivity issues started shortly after midnight in the United States on Monday - around 5pm AEDT on Tuesday in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS says it originated from on their data centres on the east coast of the US that run the cloud computing services, which power the web-based services and applications used by businesses and governments globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company attributed the outage to a faulty configuration change related to a breakdown in the Domain Name System - or DNS - that manages internet traffic, connecting tech devices to websites by converting letters to numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Worthington is an honorary senior lecturer in computing at the Australian National University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The new good news is it looks like this wasn't a cyberattack or hackers or anything (like that). They (AWS) were doing some sort of software maintenance upgrade. And got it wrong. And it was just a matter of when they could patch up the mistake. Well, all those servers are interconnected. In part, it's to provide redundancy - so if one goes down, the other one can pick up the service. And also to distribute the load around the world. Where people are using it, they put it there. But it does mean that in some cases, if there is a fault, it will spread throughout the system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA-W-S says systems started to recover three hours after the outage began.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then at the 15-hour mark, the company announced the disruption to 64 internal services had been resolved; and their programs had \"returned to normal operations\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Worthington says the impacts of this outage have been less severe in Australia due to it hitting outside of business hours, but there are still actions that can be taken to improve preparedness in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat would include having backup systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't necessarily have to use one of the large US companies. There are other companies that you can use from around the world. I think the main thing is just don't be dependent on one. To make sure you have alternatives to keep your business working (and) your family communications working when the technology has a problem. That would be making sure you're not all using the same telephone company. Making sure you've got some money. Have different email services so you can still communicate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have also been calls for tougher governance and regulatory settings to avoid too much control being held by a handful of companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity expert Ed Amoroso is the CEO of TAG Infosphere and a research professor at New York University.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says understanding the nature of how the cloud system works - both its benefits and weaknesses - is crucial to mitigating the risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean, the ripple effects of this is obvious. We've all become very dependent on cloud and the big hyperscalers. So the costs are low and the service levels are high. That's the good thing. The bad thing is the proverbial 'all your eggs in one basket'. Now, even if you take a multi-cloud approach, if you say, well, I'm going to spread my capability across multiple providers, well, who knows? The next attack might be around multi-cloud interaction. And if you were in one place, you'd have been safe but using multiple, you're not. Very difficult to predict. So we live in an era right now where we are very dependent on the cloud providers. So we need them to be at the top of their game. And today, Amazon was not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis latest incident is not the first Amazon cloud service outage.\n\n\n\n",

And we never heard a peep out of the Australian government about their rights in international waters when they were subjected.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Australia expressed their concerns to China after China's Southern Theater Command air force accused Australian aircraft of intruding into China's airspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nIn AFL ...\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Scott and Dean Cox have been named as the coaches who will take Victoria and West Australia forward for the first State of Origin game in almost 27 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two coaches were announced on Tuesday ahead of the Origin game to be played in Perth next February.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AFL's last Origin fixture was back in 1999, when Victoria defeated South Australia at the MCG.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Australian government's official travel advisory service says taking out travel insurance before a trip is as important as having a passport.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a new study has found that one in seven Australian travellers (14 per cent) were not covered by travel insurance on their most recent international trip, up slightly from last year's report (13 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 Travel Insurance Survey was commissioned on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) and the Insurance Council of Australia, and asked 1,001 Australians about their travel safety habits.\n\n\n\nWho was more likely to travel without insurance?\n\nThe report found younger people were more likely to travel without insurance \u2014 23 per cent of those surveyed under 30 were not covered on their most recent overseas trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong travellers aged between 18 and 25, one in 10 travelled without insurance specifically because they could not afford it.\n\n\n\nThe survey's authors said those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds were also more likely to go without, with 23 per cent of respondents born overseas not covered on their most recent overseas trip.\n\n\n\nWhy didn't people get insurance when travelling?\n\nThe survey found that around two-thirds (65 per cent) who travelled without insurance gave it some thought before deciding to go without.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those who were not covered on their last trip outside of Australia, the main reason they chose not to buy insurance was that they were travelling somewhere they believed to be safe, at 31 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than one in four (27 per cent) didn't think it was good value for money, and nearly a quarter (24 per cent) simply didn't think of it or it didn't cross their mind.\n\n\n\nOther reasons included not being sure if it was needed (22 per cent), being confident they could cover any emergency costs out-of-pocket (22 per cent), and going on a very short trip (20 per cent).\n\n\n\nDo you need to buy travel insurance?\n\nDFAT's Smartraveller website strongly recommends travellers take out insurance before a trip and says it's \"as important as a passport\", and that \"if you can't afford travel insurance, you can\u2019t afford to travel\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartraveller says on its website that the Australian government is limited in how and when it can help Australians overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You must take responsibility for your situation when you travel. This includes your finances. Consular services are not a 'backup plan' if things go wrong and you need money. We expect all Australians travelling overseas to take out appropriate insurance for their trip.\"\n\n\n\nWhat else did the survey find?\n\nThis year's survey found 45 per cent of travellers were willing to take risks in pursuit of unique or memorable experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nForty-six per cent of travellers said they either had or would personally consider travelling overseas for a medical procedure, most commonly dental care (30 per cent). Nearly seven in 10 of those who said they would consider it nominated lower cost of treatment as a motivation.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Here are the travel destinations Australians are heading to this spring\n\nMany respondents also said the current global political environment had influenced their feelings towards travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half (56 per cent) of travellers said current tensions meant there were countries they had planned to visit but would now avoid, and 53 per cent said they feel less comfortable travelling overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo in five (41 per cent) said the current geopolitical situation had made them less likely to take international trips at all.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nThere was a time when the cartoon version of cruising involved someone on the pool deck enjoying a fruity drink topped by a cherry and pink cocktail umbrella. It didn\u2019t matter about the quality of the spirits in the drink, since all you could taste was pineapple and coconut juice. Your most difficult choice was between rum or vodka. Now it\u2019s more likely to be happy days than happy hours, with cruise lines offering far more sophisticated drinks, and with far more choice of labels. Scenic\u2019s ocean ships are the perfect example: they carry 100 premium wines and 130 whisky labels. Whisky at the bar on Scenic Eclipse. Not only that, but guest interaction with invited wine experts and celebrity mixologists has become common, and so, too, have speciality bars on cruise ships. If you want to indulge in interesting drinks at sea, there\u2019s never been a better time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is win-win. Collaborations with premium alcohol brands add pizzazz to cruise brands, and sourcing drinks from small producers results in a better profit margin. Passengers are pleased because the wider trend towards boutique beverages on land has created an appreciation of niche beers, wines and spirits, and our palates have become more demanding. Scenic Bar on Scenic Eclipse. The trend has been around a while. In 2016, for example, Carnival Cruise Line was first to launch an on-board brewery, RedFrog, which now appears on several ships. Carnival Cruise Line has a decade-long relationship with Sydney\u2019s Lord Nelson Brewery and a more recent one with Aussie gin producer Four Pillars. Norwegian Cruise Line has its own-label gin, pilsner and prosecco, and Royal Caribbean its Chilla Thrilla tropical ale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJazz bar on Carnival\u2019s Mardi Gras.

Cunard produced a special-edition gin for the launch of new ship Queen Anne under its Cunard 4 Queens gin range. Oceania broke open an exclusive 20-year-old cask whisky by Chapter 7. It also started rum and whisky programs on its ships, which include mixology classes and chocolate and tea pairings with The Macallan, one of the world\u2019s most expensive malt whiskies, and Brugal 1888 Doblemente Anejado rum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year Princess Cruises added MEILI vodka, created by actor Jason Momoa, to its range of one-of-a-kind spirits from well-known personalities, such as tequila by Matthew McConaughey, Irish whiskey by Liev Schreiber, and a non-alcoholic sparkling ros\u00e9 by Kylie Minogue. The trend towards more focused on-board bars is growing too. MSC\u2019s just-launched ship MSC World America features three of them. Elixy Bar specialises in bourbon and bourbon-based cocktails, The Gin Project focuses on American and Canadian gins, and a British-style pub features its own microbrewery.

A renowned Egyptian architect and local village craftsmen were harnessed to bring her vision to fruition, a fusion of the architecture and design elements of a traditional Egyptian noble house with the amenities of a glamorous luxury hotel. Aboukheir describes it as a \u201cmix of Lebanese, Syrian and Turkish influences, with Italian colours\u201d. This is the only Egyptian hotel to wear the gold crown of the prestigious Relais & Chateaux association. The look Fountain Suite. It\u2019s a transportive experience. From the dusty rural world outside, you enter a stylised rendering of an Egyptian palace, complete with scalloped arches, domed ceilings, splashing fountains and sandy hued walls. Aboukheir set the tone for her desert resort, travelling the Middle East and rescuing handcrafted wooden doors, marble tiles, terracotta, painted glass and unwanted fountains from Ottoman-era villas in Alexandria and Cairo with demolition notices on the front door. The 54 rooms are clustered around courtyards with fountains and sunken tiled pools accented with sprays of bougainvillea.

        "text": "There\u2019s also the \u201cdebasement\u201d trade, with investors reducing their holdings of sovereign debt and exposures to fiat currencies because they fear heir value will erode as the US and other overly indebted governments are eventually forced to tackle their debt burdens by printing more money. That\u2019s another macro reason to buy gold. Loading At a more micro level, falling interest rates in the US \u2013 even with the inflation rate edging up as the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs starts to flow through \u2013 have been a factor in the sell-off of the dollar. Gold generates no income but for traders carries both holding and opportunity costs. The slide in US rates \u2013 from mid-January the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond has tumbled from 4.78 per cent to 3.96 per cent \u2013 has helped reduce those costs of holding gold, while the inflation rate has, thanks largely to Trump\u2019s tariffs, jumped from 2.3 per cent in April to 2.9 per cent in August. Inflation data for September has been delayed by America\u2019s government shutdown, but is expected to be released on Friday. Market forecasts are for another rise to 3.1 per cent, which would normally be a positive for the gold price, given bullion\u2019s perceived role as a hedge against inflation.\n\nThere are, however, other developments looming that will overshadow the release of the inflation data. Next week, the Federal Reserve Board meets amid expectations that it will cut its policy rate for the second time this year, although that isn\u2019t a given, particularly if inflation is higher than expected. Perhaps of greater significance, there is also a scheduled meeting of Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, which starts on Tuesday. Trump\u2019s initial response to China\u2019s announcement of tightened controls over exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets was to angrily threaten 100 per cent tariffs on all US imports from China.\n\nAlmost immediately, however, he backed away, adopted a conciliatory tone and started talking about the \u201creally great\u201d deal \u2013 \u201cfantastic for both countries, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world\u201d \u2013 that he hopes to negotiate with Xi. China\u2019s dominance of rare earths, vital for most advanced manufacturing and weapons, means that Xi enters any trade discussion with Trump holding by far the more potent hand, regardless of Trump\u2019s bombastic talk of America\u2019s strengths. The optimistic prospect of a trade deal that defuses the tensions between the world\u2019s two key economies is a negative for the gold price. Gold thrives in environments where there is fear, uncertainty and volatility. It is instructive that Wall Street\u2019s so-called \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 the VIX index \u2013 which measures market volatility, spiked in response to China\u2019s new rare earths export rules and what appeared to be an abrupt rise in trade tensions, before subsiding when Trump started making more placatory noises.\n\nAnother possible ingredient in the mix that helped trigger the steep gold price fall is the fallout from the US government shutdown, which has impacted more than just the inflation data. Loading With a lot of economic and financial data not being collected because workers have been furloughed and agencies effectively closed, commodity traders have lost access to the weekly report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that provides them with insights into how hedge funds and other institutional investors are positioned in gold and silver futures. They are operating within an information vacuum, which tends to make investors nervous and defensive. Given how far and how fast gold and silver prices had run up \u2013 the gold price jumped about $US1000 an ounce in less than two months \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that some traders decided to reduce their exposure. Having said that, the fundamentals for gold and other precious metals remain solid.\n\nWhile the global economy has held up better than expected in the face of Trump\u2019s trade wars, their full impact won\u2019t be seen until next year. Loading US and global debt levels remain extremely high and are still rising. Geopolitical tensions may or may not wane, but they won\u2019t disappear. Central banks will continue to increase their gold holdings as a strategy for diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets, and they and their governments will also look for new trading partners and new currencies for trade after Trump has made it clear that historic relationships and institutions no longer matter to the US.",

        "text": "For a media institution that set standards for cultural taste and commodified luxury leisure, this was a literal and symbolic test for gaining access to the company\u2019s rarefied world. Michael M Grynbaum, a media reporter for The New York Times , now takes some of its shine off in his robust retelling of the making \u2013 and unmaking \u2013 of the magazine empire.\n\nIf you had recognised these three names, you would have been one step closer to working at Vogue in the 1990s. These public figures were listed on a set of typed pages that candidates had to identify during an interview with the storied fashion magazine.\n\nWith publications like The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and GQ, the company once wielded unparalleled cultural influence. \u201cFor decades, one company \u2026 told the world what to buy, what to value, what to wear, what to eat, even what to think,\u201d Grynbaum writes. But in the past two decades, the internet and social media has eroded the power of print media and democratised taste-masking. Influencers now exert greater sway than magazines.\n\nThe company started at the turn of the 20th century when the namesake Cond\u00e9 Montrose Nast began building his stable of publications. In 1909, he made a savvy move in acquiring Vogue \u2013 a fashion magazine for old-money readership \u2013 and reoriented its message as \u201cinclusive exclusivity\u201d to the middle class. Like its later incarnation, Vogue became a major \u201cglobal tastemaker\u201d.\n\nAnna Wintour, a former Vogue editor and global chief content office of Cond\u00e9 Nast. Credit: AP\n\nNast\u2019s publications, like House & Garden and Vanity Fair, would enjoy a heyday until the 1940s. After the end of World War II, readers turned away from these periodicals to more moderate outlets such as TIME and Reader\u2019s Digest. Samuel Newhouse, a media baron making his fortune in newspapers, acquired the Cond\u00e9 Nast titles during the decline, and later split his media assets between his two children.\n\nNewhouse\u2019s younger son, Samuel Irving \u201cSi\u201d Jr., took the temperature of changing attitudes in 1980s America and chose to embrace the excess and opulence of the decade. Vanity Fair, GQ and Vogue would glorify a luxurious lifestyle, pushing refined taste, style and fashion in an era defined by conspicuous consumption and self-obsession.",

        "text": "A long-time caravanner with years of travel experience around Australia has shared one of the \"coolest\" features she's ever encountered at a holiday park, insisting it\u2019d be a \"huge hit\" if others followed suit.\n\nCaravan enthusiast Lauren is originally from Hawaii but now lives on the Sunshine Coast with her husband, Brad, when she\u2019s not travelling.\n\nHer glowing review comes as more Australians than ever before take to life on the road. Rising costs of living, skyrocketing rent prices, and a renewed appetite for local travel since the pandemic have seen caravan and camping holidays surge in popularity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFamilies in particular are embracing the freedom and affordability of packing up the car and exploring the country, with caravan park bookings across regional Australia hitting record highs in recent years.\n\nWhile travelling with children can be one of the challenges of life on the road, Lauren said she was blown away by the Sandstone Point Holiday Resort\u2019s \"amazing\" food delivery service, which she branded a huge help when it came to dinner time and cleaning up.\n\nLocated about an hour\u2019s drive north of Brisbane, the park sits slightly west of Bribie Island. The mother of two told Yahoo News the delivery service is perfect for families, branding it \"actually the coolest experience ever.\"\n\nLauren ordered a steak sandwich with chips, a poke bowl and the barbecue chicken pizza. Source: TikTok/sunny.and.sons\n\nMum praises 'amazing' caravan park game-changer\n\nLauren explained that \"you simply call a number to order\" and let the staff know the site number. \"It could not have been easier with no need to cook or wash up,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"In a caravan it\u2019s so easy to make a mess (particularly when cooking) and we obviously don\u2019t have a dishwasher, so having the night off from cooking and washing up was a real treat. Being confined to a physically small space means constant tidying up to avoid catastrophic messes.\"\n\nHer praise highlights a growing trend among modern holiday parks \u2014 many of which are reinventing themselves with luxury amenities, on-site restaurants, resort-style pools and kid-friendly entertainment to attract a new generation of travellers.\n\nWith both children still being quite young \u2014 aged between two and four \u2014 Lauren said it\u2019s difficult to get them to sit still at a restaurant. \"We don\u2019t eat out too often,\" she said. \"Having delicious, fresh, hot food delivered for us to eat in the comfort of our own 'home' was just perfect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It would be amazing if more parks offered something similar! I think it would be a huge hit for families or anyone who wanted the night off from cooking and cleaning.\"\n\nSandstone Point Holiday Resort had some of the \"most incredible amenities\" for a caravan park, Lauren said, adding that it is \"absolutely the best\" she has visited.\n\nLauren said that for her family, the stay cost about $100 a night, but jumped to almost $200 on the weekend because there was a concert on at the adjoining hotel. She said she'd paid $100 a night at caravan parks that have zero amenities, so for the family, \"it was totally worth it.\n\nLauren and her husband Dave, who run the Sunny and Sons travel blog, live in their 21.6-foot caravan with their two young sons, Zephyr, four, and Hawkes, almost two.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe family moved back to Australia last April after several years in Hawaii, and have since settled on the Sunshine Coast, where Dave grew up, when they\u2019re not travelling the country in their home on wheels.\n\n\"We love the travel lifestyle,\" Lauren said. \"Dave and I travelled consistently for the first five years of our relationship, and it\u2019s just a part of who we are. We truly believe travel, particularly seeing the world and how others live, made us into the people we are today, and we want to instil that same curiosity and open-mindedness in our children.\"\n\nThe family officially hit the road at the end of July this year and is now coming up to three months of full-time caravan life.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
