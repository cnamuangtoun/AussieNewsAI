        "text": "Limited access and scarce funds are the key challenges facing health officials trying to respond to the latest Ebola outbreak in southern Congo, the World Health Organisation said Friday.\n\nIt is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo with poor road networks, which is more than 1000 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.\n\nA United Nations peacekeeping helicopter was used to help deliver 400 vaccine doses on Friday to the outbreak's epicenter, in the locality of Bulape, Patrick Otim, WHO's program area manager, said at a briefing in Geneva.\n\nAn additional 1,500 doses will be sent from the capital of Kinshasa. (AP)\n\nAn additional 1500 doses will be sent from the capital of Kinshasa, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have struggled in the last seven days with access, but are collaborating with MONUSCO (U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo) now,\u201d Otim said.\n\nWhile the WHO and Congolese authorities have \u201cramped up efforts to have a full-scale response\u201d on the ground, \u201cwe need to be able to pay for the operations,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the outbreak was confirmed on September 4, the number of suspected cases has increased from 28 to 68, Africa\u2019s top health agency said Thursday. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has so far reported 16 deaths.\n\nOtim said the most recent confirmed case was located 70 kilomeres from the current epicenter, though it's still in the same province.\n\n\u201cOur worry is if we get cases in the other health zone, we need to expand, and it will be resource-intensive,\u201d he said.\n\nWHO\u2019s projected cost for the current outbreak over the next three months is $US20 million ($30.1 million), while Congo\u2019s national response plan is estimated at $US78 million ($117.4 million), said Otim.\n\nA major concern for health officials has been the impact of recent US funding cuts. The US had supported the response to Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including in 2021 when the US Agency for International Development provided up to $US11.5 million ($17.3 million) to support efforts across Africa.\n\nHealth workers to be prioritised in vaccination\n\nAt least four health workers are among the confirmed cases, according to Mathias Mossoko, Congo's Ebola response coordinator in Bulape.\n\n\u201cFor now, our priority is to vaccinate health care workers. Given the number of cases and deaths among health care providers, protecting these front-line workers is essential to ensure the population receives adequate care,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least 94 per cent of the suspected cases\u2019 contacts \u2014 more than 600 people \u2014 have been traced, with only one so far confirmed to be infected, Mossoko said, adding that there's minimal risk of the disease spreading to other provinces.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, it is not yet appropriate to declare a public health emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders said its team is assisting in the response and worked with the WHO to establish an Ebola treatment center at the Bulape hospital.\n\n\u201cWe helped reinforce triage protocols, supplied essential medicines and personal protective equipment, and conducted training in infection prevention and control and symptomatic care,\u201d said Brice de le Vingne, the group\u2019s emergency coordinator.",

(AP)\n\nSome question her chances to take over a male-dominated system\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service issued a careful assessment last year that it views Kim Ju Ae as her father\u2019s likely successor, citing a comprehensive analysis of her public activities and the state protocols provided to her.\n\nHowever, some outside experts disagree with that assessment, citing Kim Jong Un\u2019s relatively young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea\u2019s power hierarchy.\n\nIn its recent briefing at parliament, the National Intelligence Service assessed that Kim has no major health issues and that he conducted official schedules in China smoothly.\n\nSince its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been successively ruled by male members of the Kim family \u2014 Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung.\n\nKim Jong Un inherited power in late 2011 upon his father's death.",

(ABC News: Michelle Stanley)\n\nTheir scale makes recycling difficult and costly, with almost 95 per cent of mining tyres eventually buried in the ground.\n\nThe practice of burying old mining tyres is not against national environmental regulation.\n\nThere are hopes that changes to environmental regulations across the country will pressure miners to recycle more.\n\nA simple solution\n\nAlmost half, 49 per cent, of all mining tyres in Australia are in Western Australia's Pilbara, according to a report by Tyre Stewardship Australia.\n\nPilbara is ranked as the largest mining precinct in the country in terms of earth displacement, meaning companies rely on open-cut mining vehicles.\n\nThe Port Hedland recycling facility is the first of its kind. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nThat was why Tyrecycle opened the first dedicated off-road mining tyre recycling facility in Port Hedland, 1,630 kilometres north of Perth, at the heart of the region.\n\nOld, worn-out mining tyres are sent to the facility where they are processed using a specialist \"T-rex\" machine imported from Italy.\n\nThe tyres are broken down into smaller chunks of rubber.

(Supplied: Glass Manifesto)\n\nThe vase-like piece draws on Clifton's roots in ceramics, \"subverting\" the structured nature of glassmaking.\n\nWorking inside out and upside down, she layers interior colours with multiple panes of clear glass, using chips and powders to give it a ceramic-like veneer, then draws on the surface.\n\n\"Vetri is Latin for glass, and graph is Greek for drawing with, or drawing on \u2026 and I've mashed them together, in a very rude fashion,\" she says.\n\nClifton layers interior colours with multiple panes of clear glass.

(ABC News)\n\nSenior curator of ceramics and glass Reino Liefkes was struck by Clifton's \"incredible technical mastery\", her \"intense\" colours, and the beauty.\n\n\"The aesthetics are different really from any glass that we do have,\" he says.\n\n\"We're not after just something beautiful \u2026 it has to be something that has not been done really before.\n\n\"What we try to do is really to show how the art and the practice sort of evolves \u2026 so we're looking out for things that are new and make significant changes to the [existing] body.\"\n\nPartners in creativity\n\nIt's also somewhat of a love story.\n\nClifton's journey in glass began nearly three decades ago, when \"an attractive young English glassblower\" named Peter Bowles entered her orbit.\n\n\"And I really got interested in glass blowing,\" she says.\n\nClifton's journey in glass began nearly three decades ago, when Peter Bowles entered her orbit.

(ABC News: Jonny McNee)\n\nBut she says it could be some time before the significance is fully realised.\n\n\"When museums acquire objects for their collections, they aren't just doing it for the present moment, they're doing it to write the future history of a discipline, of how creativity evolves,\" she says.\n\n\" And so I think the full significance of this will be understood in another 10 or 20 or 50 or 100 years' time. \"\n\nHall says the acquisition is monumental.

(Supplied)\n\nNSW Australian Football Heritage Association president Ian Granland said the code was brought to the Hunter by Victorian miners looking for work.\n\n\"When the gold kind of fell over in Bendigo and Ballarat, there were miners there who wanted to continue in that type of work and they moved to areas like the Hunter region,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of these blokes played Aussie rules and they continued on and the standard was quite high at the time.\"\n\nThe trophy was first won by Wallsend in 1888-89, but the competition soon fell over.\n\nThe Black Diamond was not seen again for decades.\n\nWhen the Newcastle Football League was resurrected in 1948, the Rushton family from Wallsend dusted off the cup that had been gathering dust in their garage.\n\nMuseum piece up for grabs\n\nThe trophy bounced around between teams across the Hunter until 1998, when it became an exhibit at the Newcastle Museum.\n\n\"As part of that relationship and the fact that it is Australia's oldest sporting trophy contested for today, we let it go out \u2026 every year for the grand final,\" Mr Hampton said.\n\nTerrigal Avoca Panthers will take on the Newcastle City Blues for the Black Diamond Cup.

        "text": "Greek philosopher Heraclitus told us 2,500 years ago that change was a constant. Yet humans still tend to find flux deeply uncomfortable.\n\nRevered Brooklyn indie rock band Big Thief understand change \u2014 its challenges and its benefits \u2014 intimately.\n\nTheir ever-evolving take on folk-inflected indie rock demands comfort with shifting sounds and moods. Each member's restless creative nature means they are always eager to make art beyond the band they share.\n\nBig Thief wanted an \"ecstatic feeling\" to run through their sixth album, Double Infinity. (Supplied: 4AD/Remote Control)\n\nWhile change is constant in their lives and their creative work, Big Thief remains a kind of grounding force that drives everything they do.\n\n\"Every time we go off and do our own solo things and do other projects, it feeds back into our band,\" frontwoman Adrianne Lenker tells Double J's Karen Leng.\n\n\"We take all the things that we learn, and we inevitably just grow and get better as musicians from each project. I think that always ends up coming back and filling up the Big Thief cup.\"\n\nEven by their standards, the past couple of years have been especially disruptive. Founding bassist Max Oleartchik left the band last year for interpersonal reasons.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"Our love for each other is infinite, and we are so grateful for all we have shared these many years together since the beginning of our journey as a band,\" the group wrote on social media.\n\n\"We wouldn't be who we are without Max. This separation marks the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one for Big Thief.\"\n\nThat new era meant the core trio \u2014 Lenker, drummer James Krivchenia, guitarist Buck Meek \u2014 had to reimagine what their next statement would sound like without Oleartchik's significant musical contributions.\n\n\"It was a big emotional split for the band, and we needed a lot of time to regroup as the three of us and sort of ground down,\" Krivchenia tells Double J.\n\n\"We did a lot of writing and a lot of talking, and just kept growing this pile [of songs], trying to find what the centre of gravity for the next record was going to be.\n\n\"Slowly there started to be this conglomeration of songs, where it's like, 'This feels kind of like the core.'\"\n\nKey elements: collaboration, drones, laughter\n\nThat core became Double Infinity, a lean collection of nine songs that contrasts the sprawling ambition of 2022's Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You.\n\nThough the band has formally shrunk to three members, the album thrives on collaboration.\n\nDouble Infinity is Big Thief's first album as a trio. (Supplied: Genesis Baez)\n\nA large cast of musicians joined the trio at New York's legendary Power Station studios, working over three weeks to bring their songs to life.\n\nThe ensemble gathered each afternoon and played late into the night, chasing a kind of transcendent jubilance they felt was embedded in the material.\n\n\"I feel like all these songs really lend themselves to the arrangements that we were envisioning, in terms of having this bigger band,\" Lenker says.\n\n\"We wanted this ecstatic feeling and this high frequency, like some momentum on the album.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThey also wanted a drone element to subtly thread through the record \u2014 a sonic undercurrent that supported the arrangements without drawing attention.\n\n\"I think the through line and what connects a lot of these songs is either an element of trance or drone,\" Lenker says.\n\n\"Maybe it's happening underneath it all, and you don't even notice it, but that is happening on the whole album. If a song didn't lend itself to that, it didn't make the cut.\n\n\" So many of the songs that we had to cut, we loved just as much, but they just didn't fit this vibe, with all these musicians and what we were going for. \"\n\nSome of that drone comes courtesy of ambient and new age pioneer Laraaji, who entered the band's orbit in a fittingly mystical way.\n\n\"Adrianne got his business card when they were jamming together during a lunar eclipse on a mountain at a music festival,\" Krivchenia says.\n\n\"We had all been fans of his work for a while. We've been to some of his laughter workshops at festivals and been fans of his records and seen him play a lot.\"\n\nBig Thief invited a lot of friends to play with them on Double Infinity. (Supplied: Genesis B\u00e1ez)\n\nWhen the idea of building a larger band emerged, Laraaji's name came up \u2014 and it made sense.\n\n\"When we were thinking about it, building this big band, we were like, 'We need a droner.' Once Laraaji's name got thrown into this circle, we're just like, 'Of course.'\"\n\nHis musicality matched the band's vision, and his presence brought something deeper.\n\n\"I've only really heard him play alone, so I was curious what he would be like with other people,\" Krivchenia says.\n\n\"But also, knowing him a little bit through being in his laughter workshops and seeing him play live, he seems like a really interesting presence that we could probably learn a lot from in the studio for three weeks. Sign me up for that.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nLaughter meditation is one of Laraaji's trademarks. While he did not lead any sessions during recording, Big Thief had already felt their power.\n\n\"I did take one of his laughter workshops in Kerrville, at the Kerrville Folk Festival, and it was awesome,\" Lenker says.\n\n\"He teaches you to laugh from all the different parts of your body,\" Krivchenia says. \"You're learning these techniques, sort of a schematic experience of laughter. Also, people are just bursting out into real laughter because it's also contagious. It's a very beautiful thing, you're learning about your body, but you're also just cracking up.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nBig Thief's music runs the emotional gamut \u2014 any fan who has not shed a tear or stifled a chuckle is probably not paying attention. That \"ecstatic feeling\" they were chasing notably found its way into the third single, Los Angeles, which opens with a patchwork of laughter, preserving the joy of the session.\n\n\"That was a real moment of us bursting out laughing,\" Lenker recalls.\n\n\"It was kind of like a domino effect where everyone just started laughing and then we were like kicking into the song. We all lost our headphones during that take, and it didn't even matter.\"\n\nHow Big Thief help us remember that life is full of both pain and beauty Photo shows Four members of Big Thief stand close together. One member has his arm around Adrianne Lenker's sternum. \"I always feel like I write about the simplest yet most perplexing things.\"\n\nIt was emblematic of the spirit that ran through the Double Infinity sessions: fun, open-hearted and deeply present.\n\n\"There was just this spirit,\" Lenker says. \"I feel like everyone left their stuff at the door and everyone just was there to be very present and put their best foot forward. To open their hearts to the music.\n\n\"It made for quite a joyous experience. I just felt like everyone was right there, like we were having a musical conversation, and no one was really analysing it.\"\n\nChange \u2014 like the sky, like the leaves, like a butterfly\n\nBig Thief made some big changes on the road to Double Infinity, but change has always been part of their story.\n\n\"It's kind of hard to have any perspective,\" Krivchenia says. \"It all feels like this churning, changing thing.\n\n\"I feel like everything we've ever done, every tour, every year that goes by, you're always like, 'Whoa, we're different', or, 'We're levelling up', or there's some emotional breakthrough in a talk we had.\n\n\"There's all these little points along the way where, like, 'that was actually really big', but was kind of hard to feel in the moment.\n\n\"I hope every record sort of feels like a new chapter in some way. I don't want to be retreading unless that's the goal.\"\n\nDouble Infinity is out now.\n\nHear Karen Leng on Double J lunch, weekdays from midday or any time on the ABC listen app.",

        "text": "In a coastal tourism town, it is not unusual for the cooler months to be a quiet time of year.\n\nBut as spring starts to warm up South Australia's Yorke Peninsula, there is deep concern in the community about what will happen if a dip in visitors continues into summer.\n\nCome the warmer months, Ardrossan should be stacked with keen recreational fishers casting a line, and beach houses full of families and friends ready to enjoy the popular Yorke Peninsula.\n\nLocal business owners are worried about the impact on the town if that does not happen this summer, with the beachside community one of many impacted by the ongoing toxic algal bloom.\n\nColleen Kluske says there has been about a 20 per cent drop in foot traffic over winter. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\nAt the town's newsagency, owner Colleen Kluske said foot traffic was down by about 20 per cent during the winter months.\n\n\"We can handle that,\" she said.\n\n\"If that continues through spring and through summer, and onto next year, 20 per cent down over our peak season is a lot to be down.\n\n\"It may be 50 per cent down if the caravan parks and holiday houses aren't being used, it's going to be more than 20 per cent down.\"\n\n'Are they going to come back?'\n\nThe Yorke Peninsula is a holiday destination that some South Australian families have been visiting for generations.\n\nSome in Ardrossan are worried that the impact of the algal bloom could continue to be felt even once it dissipates.\n\n\"If people start going elsewhere, are they going to come back when the crabs and the fish do come back?\" Ms Kluske said.\n\nIt is a concern echoed by Helly Easther-Smith, who is the owner of Country Getaways Holiday Rental.\n\nHelly Easther-Smith worries that if visitors don't travel to the Yorke Peninsula this year, they may not return. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\nMany of the holiday homes she manages sit along coastlines of the Yorke Peninsula ravaged by the ongoing bloom.\n\nShe is especially worried when it comes to those generational holiday-makers.\n\n\"You know, mum and dad brought their kids here as young children, now those young children are bringing their kids here,\" she said.\n\n\"If they cancel, they might find another destination and continue in that new destination.\n\n\"That does concern me, that we potentially lose those visitors that have been coming here for years and years and years.\"\n\nMs Easther-Smith said that would have a devastating effect on the tourism towns.\n\n\"There's a lot of businesses out there that are pretty reliant on tourism, and if those tourists are not coming, they will close,\" she said.\n\nThe toxic algal bloom has impacted several communities along the Yorke Peninsula. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\n'The view is always beautiful'\n\nIn addition to grants for eligible businesses affected by the bloom, the South Australian government has recently introduced travel vouchers, in a bid to encourage people to visit impacted communities.\n\nMs Easther-Smith said it was crucial people continued to support the region.\n\n\"If we don't support our local businesses, they'll have no option but to shut up shop,\" she said.\n\n\" When things do come good, there'll be nothing here, because everybody has moved on. \"\n\nMs Kluske has installed a simple sign to remind people to do just that.\n\nColleen Kluske has put up a sign encouraging people to keep supporting impacted communities. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\n\"We're hoping that it will jog people's memories, just to continue to support the Yorke's,\" she said.\n\n\"Because we do need it.\"\n\nShe wants people to know there is more to the region than a dip in the ocean or casting a line.\n\n\"Hopefully [the travel vouchers] will bring people back here, just to come read books, just sit on the beach and enjoy a glass of wine watching the sunset,\" she said.",

        "text": "The voice in Keio Yoshida's books comes to life when I chat with them, long-distance from their home in Madrid.\n\nArticulate, passionate and considered, Yoshida \u2014 an author and international human rights lawyer \u2014 is known particularly for their role in the historic Rosanna Flamer-Caldera v Sri Lanka case, the first to call for the decriminalisation in that country of same-sex intimacy between women.\n\nOn the phone, we commiserate about the heatwave sweeping Europe and Asia. I sense acutely how their practice as both a lawyer and a writer is reflected in the act of communing across (and bringing together) disparate times and places.\n\nPride and Prejudices, their new and first individually authored book, depicts different struggles for queer rights with a scope that is at once panoramic and intensely personal.\n\nIn a style typical of creative non-fiction, in which an author is present in the story they're telling, Yoshida intersperses references to case law with their personal experience.\n\nMichael Kirby has described Yoshida's book as one that will \"galvanise\" readers. (Supplied)\n\nThe evolving narrative stretches from Oscar Wilde's persecution to contemporary battles for child care, reproductive rights and trans existence. It includes the author's memories of coming \"fully out of the closet\" at 23 to starting a family and becoming pregnant just before the pandemic, in the midst of adopting a masc/genderqueer identity that left them wondering: \"Could I manage nine months in drag?\"\n\nYoshida is impelled to fight for a more considered recognition of queer lives, and Pride and Prejudices imagines how the law can tell queer stories differently.\n\nIt critiques states, families and communities that disseminate damaging narratives about queer lives as wrong, invalid or dangerous.\n\nA person's identity, Yoshida argues, is never just a question of individual personhood. It includes a person's community, children, battles for housing, bodily autonomy, freedom of movement and health care.\n\nFor Yoshida, describing and making sense of queer experience is a matter not only of safety and survival, but of flourishing, too.\n\nFor many, sharing queer stories is an act \"of joy\", they say.\n\nKate Rowe's powerful queer memoir Photo shows Person with flowing fair hair and wide smile stands at beach with arm leaning against brightly coloured block sculpture. From pain to pride, queer trailblazer Kate Rowe shares her survival tips.\n\nYoshida's latest book emerged after a conversation with Jennifer Robinson, the Australian lawyer with whom they wrote How Many More Women?\n\nThat book investigated how laws around issues like defamation and sexual violence can silence women.\n\nRobinson asked what Yoshida was going to do next.\n\n\"Top surgery,\" they recall answering.\n\n\"It felt like the tide seemed to be turning and trans rights were starting to be curtailed, so I was worried. [Robinson] was saying, you know, you should write about this, you should talk about your journey.\"\n\nThe idea appealed to Yoshida, who thought sharing their story might help other trans folk.\n\n\"I felt, in so many points of my life, I've had to research the law and find things where, if I were straight, everything would have been obvious,\" they say.\n\nPower in stories\n\nGrowing up in Northern Ireland, Yoshida struggled with coming out, a process that began in their mid-teens.\n\n\"Ireland's story is a very hopeful one of change, of the criminalisation of homosexuality until the 90s \u2014 then suddenly, in 2015, you've got self-identification for trans people and gay marriage coming in with a referendum.\n\n\" The message really is that we need to continue to fight for our legal rights. Because if we don't, they're for somebody else to take away. \"\n\n\"I still read judgements and I can't perceive the human in what they're talking about,\" Yoshida says.\n\nAs an example, they mention the US Supreme Court's upholding of a Tennessee judgement banning gender-affirming care. Wading through pages of legal minutiae and technical argument, they recall reading only one of the justices \"asking questions about the plaintiffs, about the individuals involved\".\n\nQueer family Photo shows A line-drawing cartoon of two smiling adults with two young kids, all have brightly coloured hair and clothes. Our journey to becoming a family was anything but ordinary.\n\nYoshida recounts their attempt to raise a child with their partner in Spain and learning that queer couples have to be married for both to be on the birth certificate and to be recognised as parents \u2014 a rule that does not apply to heterosexual couples.\n\nThey recall suggesting to their partner they marry, before following that thought up with the question: \"Should we challenge this in court?\"\n\nYoshida believes the biggest challenge currently facing the law in many jurisdictions surrounds questions of family, queer parenting and trans rights. They cite discrepancies in how parenthood is recognised in different countries' jurisdictions, and who the law is willing to recognise as a \"mum\", \"dad\" or \"parent\" when one or more parents are genderqueer or intersex.\n\nThey argue queer parents carry the burden of potentially losing custody of a child on the basis of their sexual or gender identity.\n\n\"I think the concept of family is being or has been co-opted by a conservative right-wing narrative, which continues to insist that the idea of family is a heterosexual couple with children, and that's the only safe, normative form of family,\" they say.\n\n\"We know that's not reality.\"\n\nABC Radio National's Top 100 Books of the 21st Century Top 100 Books is Radio National's new annual countdown where we hand over the reins to you to vote for your favourite books, and then we celebrate the Top 100 in a big weekend broadcast!\n\nAlongside all of the history the book takes in, Pride and Prejudices paints a picture of Yoshida's long personal history: the power and struggle of coming out, fearing for their future life, wondering what joy might be possible \u2014 or even thinkable \u2014 while asserting their trans identity and continuing to push back against laws that personally affect them.\n\nThroughout the book, Yoshida cites songs and films, including those by directors Pedro Almodovar and Gregg Araki; they are references to \"a part of our growing up, a part of our coming out, a part of being queer\".\n\nFor all the legal victories throughout the book, the battles are long and, in the case of international human rights law, the judgements are not binding upon the country concerned.\n\nSo how does Yoshida maintain hope? By coming back to thinking across time and space.\n\n\"Legal change is not the end of the road,\" they say.\n\n\" We have to continue to tell stories. \"\n\nPride and Prejudices is out now, published by Scribe.",

(ABC News: Marcus Stimson)\n\nCouncil said its legal fees had reached $378,000 as of July 11, prompting it to ask the community for donations to help cover costs.\n\nThe heritage-listed site at the centre of the stoush is Kelly's Bush Park, close to where the boats are berthed and nearby Cockatoo Island and ferry corridor.\n\nWhile opponents argue the development will impact their harbour views, they say there's more to the story than \"NIMBYism\" \u2014 otherwise known as Not In My Back Yard.\n\nResidents believe the extension will detract from the historical significance of the world's first Green Bans movement, where 13 women fought to protect the last parcel of natural bushland on the lower Parramatta River, known as Kelly's Bush.\n\nA combination of trade unionism and environmentalism, the movement sought to defend public open spaces and guard against socially undesirable development.\n\nThe 1971 campaign not only successfully lobbied to preserve the parklands from development, but sparked further bans that would come into effect at heritage sites in The Rocks, Darlinghurst and Glebe, as well as Aboriginal community housing in Redfern.\n\nThe second battle for Kelly's Bush\n\nBeverley Bennett is the spokesperson for the Save Our Shores group of locals from Woolwich and Hunter's Hill, which she says is dedicated to protecting the precinct's waterways and ensuring green public spaces are accessible to all.\n\nShe said the development sought to build a parking section of \"very large boats\" in front of Kelly's Bush and Cockatoo Island, a move that would \"fly in the face\" of the Green Bans legacy.\n\nRallying behind the residents are groups Friends of Kelly's Bush and The Hunters Hill Trust, both parties in the Land and Environmental Court challenge, along with Hunters Hill Sailing Club.\n\nABC News coverage of the original 1971 battle to save Kelly's Bush. (ABC Education)\n\nFriends of Kelly's Bush secretary Maureen Flowers said locals were led to believe a state heritage listing would save the parklands for future generations.\n\n\"We feel the irony of this development seeks to exploit a public amenity for private gain,\" she said.\n\n\"So it's completely at odds with the social significance of the original fight and potentially undermines that historical campaign.\n\n\"[It] begs the question, if we can't permanently protect this incredible historic site for public use, what other natural parkland or foreshore access could be also be under threat?\"\n\nMicheal Fountain Architects declined to comment due to legal proceedings.\n\nWoolwich Marina was also unable to comment.\n\nThe parklands at Kelly's Bush are heritage listed. (ABC News: Fletcher Yeung)\n\n'A disaster waiting to happen'\n\nAn amended proposal by Michael Fountain Architects revised a ban on large party boats and reduced the size of boats allowed to moor in the space from 35 metres to 25 metres.\n\nThe overall area of waterway occupied by the marina berths was also slashed by 20 per cent, from 23,560 square metres to 18,560 square metres.\n\nFormer president and life member of Hunters Hill Sailing Club, Chris Stannage said from a safety perspective, the expansion \"would be like putting a bus station in the middle of a children's playground\".\n\nA push against the Woolwich Marina expansion has landed in the Land and Environmental Court. (ABC News: Fletcher Yeung)\n\nMr Stannage, who has been sailing for over 40 years, is concerned about the safety implications for sailors and other waterway users, particularly students who attend sailing programs.\n\n\"It's the wrong facility in the wrong spot, the Cockatoo Island channel is already one of the narrowest parts of the Greater Sydney Basin waterways,\" he said.\n\nMr Stannage said unlike Sydney Harbour and Gladesville Bridge, there would be no speed limit in place.\n\nHe said reducing the boundary to 20,000 square metres mixed with an increase in traffic was also \"a disaster waiting to happen\".\n\nHe said the club's volunteers worked hard to ensure safety on the waterway and resources would be stretched thin.\n\n\" There comes a tipping point where the community's responsibility [becomes] too great to operate. \"\n\nA 'small but mighty' council\n\nIn a statement, Hunter's Hill Council said all funds raised for legal fees would go directly into its current defence and any potential appeal.\n\n\"As this is a current legal matter before the Land and Environment Court, we are unable to comment any further at this time,\" a council spokesperson said.\n\nSpeaking independently, former mayor and councillor Ross Williams said he had worked closely with the community during litigation.\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush.

Goyder has this past week foreshadowed that he won\u2019t seek re-election to the AFL\u2019s board of directors at its next annual general meeting. His impending exit can be attributed to a chairman finally deciphering the tea leaves conveying the message that his number might be up. His tenure has been anything but a straight path. Also, Goyder commenced as AFL Commission chair in 2017; these roles don\u2019t materialise regularly. AFL Commission chairman Richard Goyder at this year\u2019s hall of fame function. Credit: Getty It\u2019s plain that the process of choosing Goyder\u2019s replacement is as Byzantine as the plot of the 2025 Oscar-nominated movie, Conclave. It\u2019s a process that is also not entirely codified. Nature abhors a vacuum, and the pole that one must shimmy up to claim power is lathered in grease. How Goyder is succeeded, well, that\u2019s a murky process. Say what you want, but it\u2019s kind of mind-blowing that a billion-dollar company of such social standing in Australia as the AFL is, has no orderly succession plan in place.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that the candidates vying to fill the void do, or might include former AFL lawyer and Collingwood president, Jeff Browne; plaintiff-centric compo lawyer and former Western Bulldogs president Peter Gordon, and another certain former Collingwood chieftain and early dinnertime game show host Edward Joseph McGuire, AM. Assuming the accuracy of the registers maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, neither Browne nor McGuire has served as a director of the AFL; Gordon, however, did, between 1990 and 1993. Bringing any person in from outside the current cohort of AFL directors is a task mightily more difficult than it sounds. We\u2019re talking about a very particular type of billion-dollar business here. The sheer magnification of omnipresent public scrutiny, applied to decision-making, is manifest. Most corporate executives and professional directors would be chewed up and spat out sideways. Each potential candidate I\u2019ve named has done astonishing things professionally, and in some cases, other eyebrow-raising things that astonish. Browne has probably forgotten more about the intersection of sport, law, and business just in the last week than I\u2019ll ever know. If he\u2019s lost to the process through wicked political jiggery-pokery, the process is poorer and weaker for it.\n\nOn paper, any sport\u2019s governing body would be fortunate to have him as a director. But these things aren\u2019t ever a contest of achievements and excellence. It was Mario Puzo\u2019s Don Lucchese who put it best: \u201cmoney is a gun; politics is knowing when to pull the trigger\u201d. For a company of its standing in Australian society, the process of the AFL selecting a chairperson is remarkably unsophisticated. The AFL\u2019s constitution isn\u2019t a complex document. Essentially, it works this way: clause 60 of the AFL\u2019s constitution mandates the company must have between six and nine directors, although clause 75 then says the company in general meeting may increase (or reduce) that number. Presently, and by my count, the AFL has 10 directors. Former Collingwood president Eddie McGuire after the Magpies\u2019 finals win over Adelaide. Credit: AFL Photos At each AGM, two longest-serving directors \u2013 together with anyone else who hasn\u2019t faced the voters in three years \u2013 are compelled to retire from office. But there\u2019s no constitutional limit on the number of times a person can be re-elected. Clause 64 mandates that new, non-executive commissioners are elected by the \u201cAppointees\u201d, themselves being the voting representatives of each of the AFL\u2019s 18 clubs. If the total number of retiring directors offering themselves for re-election, and any new nominees not already directors, exceeds the number of vacant positions (being two), an election takes place. In secret.\n\nWhich conjures the adage that the only voters who\u2019ll tell you the truth about who they voted for are the ones who\u2019ll admit they voted for the other bloke. Sections 67(h) and (i) provide that the highest-polling candidates, in a first-past-the-post election, are declared elected, provided they also receive a majority of votes from the voting representatives of the 18 voting club representatives in attendance. Loading For all the talk about subcommittees vetting candidates and making recommendations to the AFL Commission, that\u2019s all convenient wallpapering in reality because pursuant to clause 70, any three clubs could band together and nominate anyone they wish to be elected. The AFL doesn\u2019t have an independence-rooted governing system or anything approaching it. Given that the clubs\u2019 Appointees also control the voting on candidates to elect as directors, the clubs wield enormous power. If it\u2019s true, the next AFL chair must come from the new directors to be elected \u2013 whether because none of the current directors want the job, or because the current cohort each know none of their own are up to it \u2013 the clubs hold four clean aces.",

        "text": "Orrell shoots on film for fun and because it looks \u201ccute\u201d. She brings her film camera on nights out, to take photos of her friends and on holidays, like on her recent trip to Europe. \u201cIt captures the moment, you can\u2019t be like \u2018I look ugly\u2019 and re-take it\u2026 The photo is what it is,\u201d says Orrell, who has been on a break from Instagram because of the pressure to capture and share a \u2018perfect\u2019 moment. \u201cI look back through my parents\u2019 pictures, and it\u2019s all about the memory and not about performing. When I get to 60, I can look back at my film photos and reminisce,\u201d says Orrell. In August, photography company Eastman Kodak reported its quarterly filings, including significant debt, which led to news headlines that the company might be facing closure. Kodak called these media reports misleading and released a statement to clarify that \u201cKodak has no plans to cease operations\u201d and is \u201cconfident it will repay, extend, or refinance its debt.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, the iconic 133-year-old camera company had to temporarily pause its film production to make upgrades to its New York factory to keep up with the motion picture and still image film demands. \u201cIt\u2019s funny talking about what\u2019s going to happen in the future. We don\u2019t know. Pentax is the only manufacturer who have produced a film camera in 20 years,\u201d says Vlahadamis. Japanese camera manufacturer Pentax launched the Pentax 17 last year, the first new film camera from a major brand since the 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s a camera that shouldn\u2019t exist today. They have almost sold out globally. But as a major manufacturer, Pentax has gone out on a limb,\u201d says Vlahadamis. The stores street view; The well-stocked film fridge.

Credit: Abby Seaman In August, FujiFilm Australia took a similar risk and re-launched QuickSnap, a 35mm single-use camera targeted at Gen-Z customers. FujiFilm Australia\u2019s general manager Mary Georgievski says the product relaunch comes at a time of culture shift and taps into the younger generations\u2019 craving for nostalgia. \u201cGen Z are a lot about mental health, slowing things down, realising what we had in the past was great. While they\u2019re highly connected digitally, Gen Z is driving a renewed appreciation for analog, choosing film not in place of digital, but alongside it,\u201d says Georgievski. Film photography is experiencing a wave of revival at the same time as compact digital cameras. Both trends are trying to tell the same story \u2013 perhaps the instant gratification of a smartphone camera is no longer satisfying for young people.\n\nDenis Hasagic was originally saving up to buy a digital camera when he was actively searching for a hobby.

Credit: Abby Seaman Instead, the 25-year-old Sydney Super8 regular picked up his dad\u2019s old Pentax MZ-50 and started shooting film. Only four out of 37 photos turned out, but Hasagic was already hooked. \u201cI saved up all this money for a digital camera and then got a film camera for much cheaper and spent the extra money on film and development,\u201d says Hasagic who bought a Pentax P30. Although saving his money was short-lived.\n\nLoading \u201cAround the new year, I counted up how much I spent last year and it was about three or four grand. So probably double that.\u201d Hasagic loves that shooting on film forces a sort of mindfulness that makes you slow down and go with the flow. \u201cThere\u2019s also the surprise element. When you get the scans back and the photo you thought was going to be really good turns out bad, but the photo you took accidentally is really amazing,\u201d says Hasagic. Professional photographer Julia Sarantis, 29, says that mistakes are to be expected when working with film.\n\nJulia Sarantis outside of Sydney Super8 wearing a tie that previous owner Christopher Tiffany gifted her.

Sarantis accidentally discovered her love of film photography when taking a required university elective. \u201cAs soon as I got in the dark room and saw the magic of the development, I got hooked,\u201d says Sarantis. \u201cI\u2019ve always had an interest in old technology. But I think in a larger, cultural way it\u2019s a deviation from immediacy of digital technology,\u201d says Sarantis.",

The spokesman said Hunt had not, to his knowledge, met, been lobbied by or received any campaign donations from Brethren individuals or entities as an MP, and had not referred any approach from Westlab for a COVID-19 contract to his department.\n\nThis masthead reported in July that Hunt also chairs a \u201ctelehealth sector working group\u201d, which is fully funded by medicinal cannabis giant Montu. Hunt said he was engaged as the independent chair of the group one day a month, with administrative support for the telehealth group being provided by Montu.

Westlab\u2019s financial report, lodged in 2022, shows its revenue increased by 926 per cent due to the pandemic between 2021 and 2022, from $52 million to $534 million. Soon after the pandemic ended, Westlab\u2019s co-owner and director, the Ballarat-based Brethren man, Gavin Grace, bought a luxury $14 million holiday home north-west of Sydney.\n\nLoading A statement from Grace, sent via a defamation lawyer, confirmed Hunt had \u201cworked with us since early 2023 in a clearly defined role of one day per month. His focus is on global healthcare and life sciences trends, providing strategic insights, participating and speaking at events\u201d. \u201cMr Hunt has made it very clear, and we were assured of this, that he had no involvement whatsoever in procurement decisions during the pandemic,\u201d Grace\u2019s statement said. \u201cThere is no conflict of interest here, real or perceived ... his contribution to Connected Global is solely about future innovation, not past government processes.\u201d Grace added that Hunt was \u201ceminently qualified for this role with our company ... and Connected Global is fortunate to benefit from his expertise\u201d.\n\nUnder the Morrison government\u2019s ministerial code of conduct, former ministers undertook not to lobby the government for 18 months, and not to take personal advantage of information they had access to as minister. This masthead is not suggesting Hunt has engaged in any wrongdoing, or breached the ministerial code. Gavin Grace is the Ballarat-based director of medical supply company Westlab.

Greg Hunt at an event in July 2025. Hunt features prominently in Connected Global\u2019s marketing. On its website, under the heading \u201cAustralia\u2019s biomedical boom\u201d, Hunt is quoted as saying, \u201cresearch is the single best way to advance health and medical care\u201d, and setting out how government money is available to fund medical innovations. At the recent PharmOut conference, Hunt was billed as being from the \u201cUniversity of Melbourne and Connected\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, documents have revealed a Brethren company, Unispace \u2013 controlled by Gareth Hales, the son of Brethren leader Bruce Hales, and a British Brethren man \u2013 won contracts ultimately worth $1.2 billion after directly lobbying the then cabinet secretary, Michael Gove. Gove appears to have put them on the then-Tory government\u2019s so-called \u201cVIP Lane\u201d for procurement. COVID-19 contracts in Britain, including those fast-tracked in the VIP lane, are now subject to a special inquiry. In Australia, the Australian National Audit Office in 2021 found the government had received approaches from more than 4000 companies to supply the National Medical Stockpile. Pitches for contracts included \u201cdirect approaches to Health ... referrals from other Australian government entities, ministers\u2019 offices and ... approaches to market\u201d. Hunt\u2019s spokesman said the Labor member for Ballarat, Catherine King, had written to him in late 2021 after meeting with Westlab. \u201cAny such letter from the Labor member for Ballarat \u2026 would have been sent to the department under standard procedures,\u201d Hunt said.\n\nThe audit office concluded that procurement processes during the pandemic had been \u201clargely consistent with the proper use and management of public resources,\u201d though there had been \u201cinconsistent due diligence checks of suppliers\u201d. It found the \u201cappropriate delegate gave the approval [for contracts] in all instances\u201d. The statement from Westlab said that, during the pandemic, \u201cat no point did Westlab, its directors, staff, or shareholders approach Greg Hunt or any government minister\u201d, and any such inference was \u201ccategorically false\u201d. During the pandemic in Australia, Westlab worked directly in partnership with a company called Sante, run by Gareth Hales. Sante and Westlab supplied PPE and RATs to the government, some of which were co-branded. Hales campaigned prominently for the Liberal Party in the recent federal election campaign, and was pictured handing out leaflets in the seat of Bennelong. This masthead reported this month that some Liberal Party campaigners were deeply concerned about the party\u2019s relationship with the church. Former minister Linda Reynolds has asked for its role in this year\u2019s election to be examined in the party\u2019s review of its disastrous loss.\n\nLoading Bruce Hales, the leader of the Brethren church \u2013 described by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May as a cult \u2013 was Westlab\u2019s \u201cindependent auditor\u201d in 2022, according to company accounts. Westlab, in its statement, claimed a senior registered auditor from Hales\u2019 firm, \u201cnot Mr Bruce Hales himself\u201d conducted the audit. The audit was \u201cperformed in accordance with ASIC and other regulatory standards\u201d, Westlab said. However, Hales is registered as an individual auditor with ASIC and it appears he personally signed the 2022 accounts. Hales runs the church, of which Grace is a member, under extremely strict rules and can excommunicate wayward members, cutting them off from their families, their businesses and all their friends.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Ever since hearing the priest utter \u201cmawage\u201d in The Princess Bride, I\u2019ve been a sucker for wedding movies \u2013 from gushy romcoms such as Mamma Mia! and The Proposal to wacky matrimonial adventures like Palm Springs and Corpse Bride. But very soon, I\u2019ll go from watching other brides to walking down the aisle myself. Since planning my own wedding, I can\u2019t watch these movies the same way. Everything that was once funny \u2013 say, a soiled wedding dress or a sabotaging maid of honour \u2013 suddenly fills me with sheer horror. In contrast, the once-boring happy endings have me itching to, as Beyonc\u00e9 would say, put a ring on it. From Father of the Bride to Bridesmaids, wedding movies tell a very different story when you\u2019re about to walk down the aisle yourself. Credit: Compiled by Matt Davidson. So, here are nine wedding films I\u2019ve watched ahead of getting hitched, and what they\u2019ve taught me about being a bride. Father of the Bride (1991) A remake of the 1950 classic, this Steve Martin caper has always been one of my favourites. But watching it as a bride-to-be is an entirely different (and emotional) kettle of fish. Martin plays an overprotective father who learns his 22-year-old daughter got engaged during a semester abroad in Rome. While attempting to come to terms with \u201closing his little girl\u201d, he subconsciously tries to sabotage the wedding, only to eventually realise he has to let her go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m my father\u2019s youngest daughter, so this hits home hard. As exciting as the big day is for the couple, it can be incredibly emotional for the parents, who probably still see you as an 11-year-old laughing along to The Princess Bride. I\u2019ll be sure to hug my dad extra tight on my wedding day. Muriel\u2019s Wedding (1994) This Aussie classic is the perfect cautionary tale for any bride-to-be. Muriel (Toni Collette) is desperate to be \u201csomebody\u201d and believes a spectacular wedding will do just the trick. But when she eventually has her so-called perfect wedding with a South African swimmer in need of an Australian passport, she quickly realises a big bash wedding can\u2019t truly change her life. A great wedding does not a perfect life make. Muriel learned that the hard way. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo I now know how easy it is to obsess over every tiny wedding detail, and to believe the smallest hitch means you\u2019ve failed as a bride. But, ultimately, who cares if the cake is slightly lopsided, or one of your guests makes an embarrassing impromptu speech? A wedding doesn\u2019t define your worth. Thanks for taking one for the team, Muriel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy Best Friend\u2019s Wedding (1997) While I once loved watching Julia Roberts\u2019 attempt to steal her best friend from his fianc\u00e9e just days before his wedding, it has since become my nightmare. Roberts plays a food critic who realises she still has feelings for her best friend/ex-partner when he announces his engagement to someone else. So, she proceeds to try to split the couple up in various sneaky, cruel ways. Now, there won\u2019t be any exes at my wedding, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019ve ever wronged somebody on the guest list \u2013 someone who has been waiting for the perfect time to strike. The one thing from this film that I\u2019d accept with open arms, however, is the scene in which the family randomly bursts into I Say a Little Prayer at the dinner table. I\u2019ll take any excuse to turn my life into a musical. The Wedding Singer (1998)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, the mullets. So many mullets. Adam Sandler plays a wedding singer who is suddenly ditched by his fianc\u00e9e, turning him into a cynical marriage-hater. That is, until he meets a wedding waitress (Drew Barrymore) who essentially teaches him to love again. The only hitch? She\u2019s engaged to someone else. Beyond the horrific hairstyles (thankfully my fianc\u00e9 simply wouldn\u2019t have time to grow a mullet even if he wanted to now), this film legitimately steered me away from hiring a singer on the off chance they\u2019re having a rough day and decide to take it out on my guests. This movie also makes it clear working in the wedding industry can be a tough and thankless gig, especially if you\u2019re heartbroken and constantly surrounded by love. There will be nothing but respect for the staff at my wedding. My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) My family may not be Greek, but they are loud. So, watching this film offers a glimpse into how my fianc\u00e9 may be feeling knowing he\u2019s entering into this crazy crew. Power to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading Jokes aside, this movie is a beautiful snapshot of two families and cultures coming together through marriage despite their differences. I grew up watching it for the hilarious interactions between the Greek aunties, but now I watch it as a reminder that a wedding doesn\u2019t only unite the bride and groom, but also the families themselves. It\u2019s also the reason we\u2019ve added lamb to our menu. 27 Dresses (2008) I\u2019ve probably seen this movie as many times as Katherine Heigl\u2019s character has been a bridesmaid. Jane is a chronic people-pleaser who has been a bridesmaid 27 times \u2013 the classic \u201calways a bridesmaid, never a bride\u201d. She becomes the subject of columnist Kevin\u2019s next story once he finds out she\u2019s kept all 27 of her horrendously ugly bridesmaids dresses.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Regional security and climate change loomed as major themes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese embarked on a colourful and at times chaotic visit through Vanuatu and Solomon Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centrepiece was the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders' meeting in Honiara. The summit's communique will outline the key outcomes of the forum\u2019s discussions but is yet to be released.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while Albanese has been keen to highlight a blossoming relationship with the Pacific family, not all has gone to plan.\n\n\n\nA Vanuatu eruption\n\nThe first stop on Albanese's Pacific trip was Vanuatu, where it was widely expected a long-awaited $500 million pact would be signed with leader Jotham Napat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nakamal Agreement, which would have seen Australia provide an additional $50 million in aid per year to the nation for the next decade, was meant to have been finalised and settled well before the prime minister boarded his RAAF jet.\n\n\n\nIt was widely expected that Australia would sign a long-awaited $500 million pact with Vanuatu leader Jotham Napat (centre) at the Pacific Islands Forum. Source: AFP / Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Last month, Australian ministers trekked to the summit of an active volcano with their Vanuatu counterparts to mark the \"finalisation\" of the deal \u2014 a stratospheric spectacle to celebrate the end of negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the smoke rising in the background was an omen, because in the days before this visit, it became clear support within Vanuatu's coalition government was far from solidified, and on Tuesday before leaving, Albanese admitted on breakfast radio the deal was unlikely to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Friday's joint press conference in Port Vila, instead of a signing, Napat revealed the reason for the collapse in support: fears the pact's wording would limit Vanuatu's ability to sign infrastructure deals with partners like China.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacific analyst Tess Newton Cain said: \"Their [Vanuatu's] main driver is to ensure that they have available to them the resources that they need to guarantee human security in Vanuatu.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means working with a wide range of partners.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nakamal Agreement was to replace a previous security deal Vanuatu never formally ratified over concerns the terms agreed with Australia would impinge on its status as a non-aligned nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese remains optimistic the agreement can be resurrected, and after sipping some cava with Napat to the tunes of King Stingray's live vocals, gave his counterpart a lift to Honiara the following morning.\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong was pressed about whether Vanuatu's ties to China were cause for concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told the Today Show: \"You might be able to speak for Vanuatu, I don't choose to,\" before a fire alarm rang out in her office, forcing the interview to be abandoned as \"evacuate now\" warnings drowned out her words. Auspicious timing indeed.\n\n\n\n4WD diplomacy\n\nSolomon Islands' hosting of the PIF in the bustling, muggy capital of Honiara has further fuelled the contest for influence in the Pacific region.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd among the new displays of calculated charity from international partners were rival fleets of vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia promised a fleet, including Ford Rangers and Toyota Hiluxes, to be liveried in the colours of Solomon Islands police, but it was China's high-end Great Wall Motor SUVs that would ferry the leaders from venue to venue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duelling announcements, made within hours of each other, dominated Australian coverage in the lead-up to the event, with stories of Pacific power plays retopped with an angle reflecting the Antipodean fondness for four-wheel drives.\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands' hosting of the Pacific Islands Forum in the bustling capital of Honiara has further fuelled the contest for influence in the Pacific region. Source: AAP / Poppy Johnston And so considerable eyebrows were raised when Albanese stepped off the plane on the Honiara tarmac and hopped into an awaiting Chinese-supplied vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he was disappointed not to be picked up by an Australian-supplied Hilux, Albanese responded glibly: \"It's a car. You know, cars get you from A to B.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Honiara, international aid partners have plastered their logos on various projects, ranging from billboards to bus stops.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Australia has long been the largest partner for development, China has its own expensive contributions, including the national stadium, which hosted the PIF opening ceremony and the media centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele addressed the increased strategic interest in the region directly in his opening address to the summit.\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele did not invite PIF partner nations, including China, the US and Taiwan, to this year's meeting. Source: AAP / Ben McKay \"The world around us is changing fast, competition from powerful interests is intensifying,\" Manele said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Pacific must never be seen as an arena for others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nManale opted not to invite PIF partner nations, including China, the US, and Taiwan, to this summit in an attempt to avoid those tensions that could upend the forum's agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose partners have, on the whole, respected the decision, and the move was criticised by Australia as well as independent Solomon Islands MP Peter Kenilorea Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\nA long-time China sceptic, he views infrastructure as \"front line\" of the strategic contest across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While Australia has been very helpful throughout our history \u2026 in perhaps a softer policy support capacity, I think the infrastructure space is where the real issues are now decided,\" he said.\n\n\n\n'Big dog' Australia's climate record questioned\n\nWhen leaders attend these summits, weeks of preparation go into planning the schedule, keeping up with customs, and drafting announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut often things don't stick to the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday's program witnessed several changes, delaying the sign-off on the Pacific Resilience Facility \u2014 a fund to help the region cover the costs of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelegates wept as the ceremony started \u2014 acknowledging the existential threat that this will go some way to addressing, and years of frustration over struggles to gain international support for mitigation and recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia contributed an opening $100 million, but Albanese initially made a striking impression when he entered.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the dapper blue dress of other leaders, he was adorned in a pink-patterned shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few minutes the wardrobe malfunction was identified and while speeches were still ongoing, Albanese, in full view of the cameras, walked out of the room for a frantic shirt change before walking back in a matching garb.\n\n\n\nThe pink shirt was never seen again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wardrobe malfunction greatly amused New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, teasing Albanese the following morning about wearing the right shirt to the family photo.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked by New Zealand media if the faux pas was a sign of Australia \"being the big dog and thinking they can wing it\", Luxon drily replied: \"I think he just forgot the instructions to be honest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got to reiterate quite a lot to the Australians what they need to be doing in the rules sometimes,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Albanese often speaks fondly about the closeness of the government to the \"Pacific family\", a coordination cock-up at a major climate event only served to highlight some of the dissonance felt by other nations around Australia's track record on emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the region is on board with a bid for a Pacific COP Climate Summit, Vanuatu's climate minister Ralph Regenvanu said Australia would need to match its climate ambitions in line with its island neighbours if it were to be a good host, as a decision on 2035 climate targets fast approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also want Australia to start to talk seriously about addressing its fossil fuel production pipeline,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenvanu argues the July International Court of Justice ruling finding nations have a legal obligation to prevent climate impacts means Australia's view that it can meet its Paris commitments by completing a domestic transition, while still exporting fossil fuels like coal and gas, is \"now untenable\".\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Albanese maintained gas is an important part of the transition and the domestic economy, while also talking up his government's climate record, describing the region's support for the COP bid as a show of trust in Australia's \"leadership\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAn impasse over the hosting rights remains \u2014 with T\u00fcrkiye also jostling for the event, with the hope a resolution can be worked out with President Recep Tayip Erdo\u011fan on the sidelines at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau will host next year's PIF before COP31, and President Surangel Whipps Jr said it would be \"an act of good faith if others would clear the way\" to allow the Pacific a global climate platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The coming weeks are make or break, which is why we agreed to work very closely with Prime Minister Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't want this major international opportunity to pass us by.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Legendary sports commentator Bruce McAvaney says \"it's no illusion\" that Australian athletics is at the beginning of a \"golden age\" of development and success in the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking ahead of his role commentating SBS' coverage of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, McAvaney said he believes Australian athletics is in the best shape it's ever been, with several serious medal contenders among the country's 80-odd member team.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney said the event, running from 13-21 September and broadcast on SBS, is potentially the third most significant global sporting event behind the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, with athletes from 198 countries participating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t get bigger than this,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A diverse group of Australians from all sorts of backgrounds, come together \u2026 with 197 other countries. There are very few global opportunities like this.\"\n\n\n\nMcAvaney says Australian athletics competitors have been building impressive momentum that he believes will lead to victories in this year's championships and continue through to the Brisbane Olympics in 2032.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we\u2019re at the beginning of a golden age, and at the Brisbane Olympics, in seven years time, that\u2019s not going to go away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And this really all began in Tokyo four years ago, where you could see the writing on the wall so I believe this group are representing a team that is in a period the whole country is going to be very excited right now and going forward.\"\n\n\n\nAustralian runner Jessica Hull won the silver medal in the Women's 1500m final at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Source: AAP / Dean Lewins At the Paris Olympics in 2024, Australia's athletics team won seven medals, the most at an Olympic Games since 1956, and the year before won six at the World Championships, also a record high.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney says momentum on and off-track makes him believe in the emergence of a golden age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s not manufactured, it\u2019s very real, it\u2019s not an illusion what\u2019s happening out there in terms of the depth of talent in our country\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOff the track he says Australia is being considered a more serious player in global athletics, with events like the Sydney marathon gaining a huge global following as one of five major marathons.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, two major medal hopes have become late scratchings \u2014 Olympic pole vault champion Nina Kennedy and racewalker Jemima Montag, who won bronze in the 20km in Paris, have pulled out of the championships through injury, threatening Australia's overall medal tally hopes.\n\n\n\nPressure on young stars\n\nNearly a quarter of Australia's team are 21 or younger, another reason why McAvaney predicts they will shine at a home Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest-profile young Australian athlete is undoubtedly Gout Gout, who at just 17-years-old and running 100 metres in under 10 seconds, is being compared to sprinting great Usain Bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the Australian teenager while in Tokyo for the competition, Bolt said even though Gout is talented, it's never going to be \"just easy\" for him to win.\n\n\n\n\"He's very talented, with the times he's running now and he's really been doing well,\" Bolt said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's something that you love to see because you want athletes to do well. The more athletes do well, the bigger the sport is, and I'm always a supporter of track and field getting bigger and doing bigger things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if he continues on this track he's going to be good, but it's all about getting everything right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGout will compete in the men's 200m heats on Wednesday 17 September.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney said Gout is \"so interesting\" given he's about to start his year 12 studies while dealing with global fame and pressure to perform.\n\n\n\nBruce McAvaney hugs Gout Gout as he celebrates winning his Under 20s 200m final at the Queensland Athletics Championships in Brisbane in March. It was the first time Gout had run below 20 seconds for the 200m.

I think he will run particularly well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney said he thinks middle-distance runner Peter Bol is another athlete who could perform well, given he's running faster now than he was when he placed 4th in the 800m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe master commentator flagged distance runner Jess Hull and discus star Matt Denny as other standouts, as well as high jumper Nicola Olyslagers, who won silver in Paris, as Australia's best medal hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She\u2019s the Diamond League champion and the world indoor champ, at the moment I think it\u2019s a 50-50 bet between her and [Ukrainian Olympic champion Yaroslava] Mahuchikh, she\u2019ll be on the podium and she\u2019s a great competitor,\" McAvaney said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to watch 2025 World Athletics Championships LIVE on SBS\n\nThe 'one lap' that inspired the whole world\n\nThis year marks the 25-year anniversary of the Sydney Olympic Games \u2014 and for many Australians, Cathy Freeman's gold medal win in the 400 metres is among their favourite sporting memories of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked about role models in athletics, McAvaney said the Indigenous runner is one of the greats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Cathy\u2019s legacy is even stronger right now than it was 25 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s how pure and rich that whole performance was from the lighting of the cauldron to winning that gold medal.

        "text": "\"Are we good enough?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis question has stayed with Felicity Button since the day she discovered $11,571 had been withdrawn from her bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 2017, and Button had just taken her baby daughter to a doctor's appointment. She says she had recently been paid, and knew she could afford the appointment, medication and petrol to return home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went to go and pay for my appointment, and my card declined,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nButton contacted Centrelink and found out that a debt collector had withdrawn the money, claiming she owed a historical robodebt.\n\n\n\nFelicity Button (pictured) was one of the lead applicants in the robodebt class action and appears in SBS's docu-drama The People vs Robodebt. Source: SBS News / Simon Morris Several years prior, Button had received income support from Centrelink \u2014 Youth Allowance and Austudy \u2014 while studying for her nursing degree and working several jobs. However, that support ended in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recalls receiving a letter in September 2016, alleging she owed a debt, which she subsequently queried with Centrelink. She says the service \"couldn't really give [her] any answers\". After nearly a year of correspondence, she was moved onto a payment plan of $20 per week. Then the money was unexpectedly withdrawn from her account in September 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile driving home, she recalls feeling powerless and saying: \"I may as well run my car off the road.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, the debt recovery scheme set up by the then Coalition government relied on an automated assessment of tax office and welfare payment data to calculate average earnings and issue debt notices to welfare recipients. The process often failed to accurately reflect earnings, with many recipients pursued for debts they did not owe, including Button.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme raised $1.76 billion from around 526,000 recipients through approximately 794,000 debt recovery transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA royal commission into the scheme, which ran between 2022 and 2023, described robodebt as a \"crude and cruel mechanism\" that was \"neither fair nor legal\" and \"made many people feel like criminals\".\n\n\n\n\"In essence, people were traumatised on the off-chance they might owe money. It was a costly failure of public administration, in both human and economic terms,\" the commission wrote in its final report in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictims suffered severe impacts from being falsely accused of owing debts, the report found. In some circumstances, the despair robodebt caused led to recipients taking their own lives .\n\n\n\n\n\nButton, now a mother of two, appears in SBS' upcoming docu-drama series The People vs Robodebt. She has been one of the lead applicants in a years-long class action lawsuit brought against the federal government over the botched debt recovery scheme, including a landmark appeal settled last week . Her money was returned; however, the ordeal has had a lasting impact.\n\n\n\n\"I think mothers inherently always question ourselves on whether or not we're doing a good enough job \u2026 and are we good enough? That's unfortunately ingrained in being a woman and a mother, for the most part,\" Button says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But this brings it to a much deeper level \u2026 It makes you think, all it takes is one thing to completely derail your life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's one of many robodebt victims who have fought for compensation and are now seeking accountability.\n\n\n\n'Financial vindication' or 'accountability avoided'?\n\nButton first joined the legal fight against robodebt in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched by Gordon Legal, the initial class action was settled in 2020, with the federal government agreeing to repay wrongfully raised debts and accrued interest \u2014 amounting to a settlement of $1.8 billion. (The majority of this cleared the $1.76 billion in unlawful deductions).\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, it announced that an appeal led by the firm had been settled for a further $548.5 million , including $475 million in compensation for victims.\n\n\n\nGordon Legal says the appeal was launched following the release of the royal commission's report in 2023, which uncovered new evidence of misfeasance \u2014 the wrongful use of legal authority \u2014 by senior public servants who designed and ran the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appeal argued that the new evidence should be considered to allow victims to seek further compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The allegations were that very senior public servants knew that the scheme they were implementing was unlawful,\" Gordon Legal partner Andrew Grech says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we were able to establish that in court, as we believed we would be able to \u2026 that would have meant group members who suffered distress or further financial loss, or in some tragic cases, had loved ones who took their own lives, would have been able to seek financial damages compensation for the distress that they suffered,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThat was very significant because many group members felt the original class action didn't really answer some of those questions, and didn't make the public servants involved truly accountable for what had occurred.\n\nGrech hopes victims feel a \"sense of finality\" and that their concerns \"have been listened to\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland said the settlement shows the Albanese government's \"ongoing commitment to addressing the harms caused to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Australians by the former Liberal government's disastrous robodebt scheme\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Settling this claim is the just and fair thing to do,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreement includes up to $60 million in administration costs and up to $13.5 million to cover the applicants' legal costs, with the remaining $475 million for compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf approved by the Federal Court, the government said this would be the largest class action settlement in Australian history. According to Gordon Legal, it would deliver more than $2.4 billion in financial redress for victims.\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland said settling the claim is the \"just and fair thing to do\". Source: AAP / Lukas Coch For Button, the settlement brought some relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It] was really reflective of the financial penalty that the government has to now pay for such an egregious act, which is sad, because we're looking at it from a financial penalty point of view \u2026 but there's no compensation to the families that lost people,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can give them all the money in the world; it's not going to bring the person back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie welcomed the settlement but said it does not \"deliver full justice\" for victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ten years on from when robodebt commenced, no-one responsible for its design, implementation and continuation has been publicly held accountable in a way that delivers justice for its victims and their families,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie said the settlement does not \"deliver full justice\" for robodebt victims. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Christopher Rudge is a lecturer at Sydney Law School, researching welfare law. Beyond the settlement being \"a day of financial vindication\" for victims, he also believes it's \"a day of accountability avoided for those who designed the scheme\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This isn't just a payout; it's the price the government was willing to pay to avoid a public trial based on the royal commission's evidence of misfeasance in public office,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe settlement ensures the central legal claim of the litigants will never be tested in court.\n\nWhile the Commonwealth may have been able to successfully defend the claim, Rudge argues: \"We still would have been able to better scrutinise the standards we expect of public servants in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGrech says that in any litigation process, \"the answers are never complete\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we think we've been able to do is to shine a light on what was unlawful conduct and to ensure that people harmed by it get some sense of closure and some redress for the harm that was caused to them,\" he says.\n\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIt could take up to six months for the Federal Court to approve the settlement, Grech says. A minimum of $475 million would then be available to distribute among members who choose to participate; however, the specifics of how that will be allocated to individuals have yet to be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith up to 471,000 members in total, Grech expects there to be tens of thousands of people who would opt to receive a fixed payment or individualised assessment. To put that in perspective: if 471,000 registered, the average compensation amount for each person would be $1,008.\n\n\n\n\n\nRudge says the settlement's billing as the largest of its kind in Australia is \"a reflection of the size of the cohort rather than the generosity of the payments to victims\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an investigation into six referrals from the royal commission is being led by the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), based on an announcement made by an independent decision maker for the NACC in February. The referrals were contained in a sealed chapter, recommending individuals for civil action or criminal prosecution.\n\n\n\nThis reversed an earlier decision by the NACC not to commence a corruption investigation against the six individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If any of those six referred individuals committed a breach of public trust, then we should expect that private hearings will be held \u2014 or could have already been held \u2014 and we await any findings emanating from those hearings,\" Rudge says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The powers of the NACC are primarily referral-based. It doesn't have the power to prosecute, lay charges or convict in its own right.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Button is relieved with the class action win, she wants to see individuals held to account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want to see criminal charges laid on the people that orchestrated, designed and constructed the scheme,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I want to see further mental health support for people who lost more than money can recoup.\n\n\n\nAnother scheme: Addressing a historical debt calculation\n\nRobodebt is not the only instance of unlawful debt calculations by government agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 27 August, the government announced it would be rolling out \"resolution payments\" for those potentially impacted by a historical debt calculation method known as income apportionment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice was used by Centrelink between 1991 and 2020 to calculate debts for recipients where it was unclear when income was earned. It involved averaging income evenly across two or more fortnightly payment blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Ombudsman found the method was unlawful in 2023, but said this arose from agencies \"genuinely holding an incorrect understanding\" of the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government estimates that around 5.5 million debts \u2014 previously or currently held by around three million people and worth around $4.4 billion \u2014 may be affected. The vast majority have already been repaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bill introduced to parliament seeks to address income apportionment by validating its use for past calculations, and setting up a resolution scheme for those with potentially affected debts.\n\n\n\nSocial Services Minister Tanya Plibersek introduced a bill to Parliament on 4 September, seeking to address income apportionment by validating its use for past calculations and establishing a resolution scheme for those with potentially affected debts. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch This follows the Federal Court's approval of a method for the government to recalculate debts owed in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, the government instead said, rather than go back and recalculate all these unlawful debts, we will put forward legislation that validates those past unlawfully calculated debts, and we will pay a $600 resolution payment to anyone identified as affected,\" Rudge says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the bill to parliament on 4 September, Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek said reopening debts and recalculating them \"would cause distress and protracted uncertainty for the people affected\", and divert critical government resources away from frontline services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was not robodebt,\" she stressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRudge says the government has been clear in distinguishing income apportionment from robodebt. However, while they are distinct methods of calculating debts, he argues there is overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A single debt could be affected by both,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAutomatic cancellation of job seeker payments 'unlawful'\n\nMeanwhile, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been investigating the cancellation of job seeker payments by a government department under an automated system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) was set up in 2018 to ensure job seekers complete specific activities, called mutual obligation requirements, in order to continue receiving payments. This process is managed by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and Services Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew laws were introduced in April 2022 that required consideration of a job seeker's circumstances before deciding to cancel a payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the ombudsman found 964 people had their income support automatically cancelled between April 2022 and last July, when the DEWR secretary paused cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A further 45 job seekers received automated cancellations after the secretary's decision to pause cancellations, when they should not have,\" ombudsman Iain Anderson said in a report, published on 6 August.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Ombudsman scolds government agencies over automatic cancellation of welfare payments SBS News 01:30 English\n\nThe ombudsman said agencies' cancellation of income support was not lawful and did not ensure processes and computer systems were complying with amended legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited conclusions from the robodebt royal commission about the use of automated processes, and the \"serious impact\" these can have on vulnerable people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report recommended the department not resume cancellations until errors are rectified and cancellations are compliant with the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparately, the government commissioned an independent assurance review into the IT system that underpins the framework. Undertaken by Deloitte and released on 14 August, it found a \"critical lack of traceability\" linking legislation, operational policy and \"automatic compliance logic\" embedded within the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a DEWR spokesperson confirmed it has accepted all recommendations from the ombudsman's report, noting it and Deloitte's review made \"a number of important findings and recommendations, including areas for urgent action and longer-term improvements\".\n\n\n\nThe department is taking immediate steps to address the urgent actions identified.\n\nThe spokesperson confirmed all payment reductions and cancellations remain paused.\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review also reported that the Deloitte report includes a number of fabricated references, including to academic works. Rudge, who discovered the errors, suspects these were generated by artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DEWR spokesperson said Deloitte has confirmed some footnotes and references in its final report were incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The department has requested that Deloitte provide a corrected version of the statement of assurance and final report as soon as possible,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News understands Deloitte is managing the matter.\n\n\n\nIn Rudge's view, the TCF has a \"broad policy commonality\" with other scandals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a framework designed to ensure that welfare recipients are never permitted to receive an entitlement that is in any way suspected of being an overpayment,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When a policy initiative is pursued relentlessly, internal decision-making becomes siloed and overly goal-oriented, and decisions are made in an unexamined way that is contrary to law. That is what has happened here, just as in the other schemes, although in a very different way.\"\n\n\n\nCould robodebt happen again?\n\nRudge points to a growing risk of technological error, particularly with the rise of AI interacting with complex legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think all of the variables combine to become the ingredients of another scandal,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we're not careful and if there isn't a paradigm shift \u2026 we could see it [robodebt] happening again.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the regional mums taking on the government's automated debt recovery scheme\n\nRudge argues a change in policy approach is needed, one that focuses on the entitlement of welfare recipients to support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The principle should be that rather than assume there is fraud in every area of the system, it should be the working assumption that people are entitled to the welfare that they are receiving, and there should be a much higher threshold for investigating fraud,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nButton hopes the robodebt settlement is a \"wake-up call to the government to say 'we're not going to tolerate this'\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says her fight was never about the money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More importantly, the future looks a bit brighter for my kids.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three episodes of The People vs Robodebt will premiere on 24 September on SBS on Demand. Episodes will air weekly on SBS.\n\n\n\n",

Tokyo first hosted the event in 1991 while they were held in Osaka in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe championships were first held in Helsinki, Finland in 1983, and since 1991, have been held every two years, with the most recent edition staged in Budapest, Hungary in August 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer big stars of the championships include Olympic great sprinters Usain Bolt and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, as well as pole vault legend Sergey Bubka.\n\n\n\nWhat events are on the program?\n\nMore than 2,000 athletes from some 200 countries will compete for 147 medals across 49 events in Tokyo, with a total prize pool exceeding $13 million and bonuses of $155,000 awarded for each world record.\n\n\n\nThe championships feature a full range of track and field action, including 12 track events and eight field events, alongside the marathon and race walks over 20km and 35km for both men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-discipline contests include the men's decathlon and women's heptathlon, and the program also features the mixed 4x400m relay.\n\n\n\nWho's in Australia's team?\n\nMore than 80 Australian athletes are in Tokyo , its largest team ever for a global championship.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team blends established stars with rising talent, including high jumper Nicola Olyslagers who won silver at the 2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris Olympics, middle-distance star Jess Hull, who won silver in the 1,500m at the Paris Games, discus ace Matt Denny, who won bronze in Paris, and long jumper Liam Adcock, who is Oceania champion.\n\n\n\n\n\nPole vaulter Kurtis Marschall, who won bronze at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, will also be competing.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerging sprint sensation Gout Gout will make his senior debut in the men's 200 metres, part of a young cohort that Australian Athletics chief executive Simon Hollingsworth said represents both current promise and potential for the lead-up to the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian sprint superstar Gout Gout breaks his own national 200m record\n\n\"You look across the cohort and it's exciting for what they'll do right now in Tokyo, but also what that potential represents over the period leading into LA and then beyond,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome top athletes, however, will be missing in Tokyo, including reigning Olympic and world championships pole vault champion Nina Kennedy, race walker Jemima Montag, who won bronze in Paris, and sprinter Lachlan Kennedy, all of whom have been sidelined by injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia ranks 13th on the all-time World Athletics Championships medal table, having claimed 15 gold medals \u2014 10 of which were won by individual athletes \u2014 and a total of 45 medals.\n\n\n\nHow can I watch the championships from Australia?\n\nStarting Saturday, every session from the nine-day event will be broadcast live and free across SBS VICELAND , including the World Athletics Championships 2025 Hub via SBS On Demand , which will also feature full replays, mini recaps and Aussie Focus clips for every session.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning sessions will run from 8am to 1.30pm AEST on September 13\u201315 and 20\u201321, while evening sessions will be from 8pm to 11.30pm AEST each night of the championships.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE McAvaney takes the lead for SBS\u2019 coverage of the 2025 World Athletics Championships\n\nSBS director of Sport Ken Shipp said the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo is an \"unmissable viewing\" experience for Australian fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've broadcast ten editions of the World Athletics Championships since 2001, and this one shapes as a spectacular opportunity for Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce McAvaney is leading the expert commentary along with former world indoor 800m champion Tamsyn Manou to call the track events, while renowned SBS commentator David Basheer is bringing audiences all the action in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the full schedule for SBS's broadcast of the World Athletics Championships.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Which is at the same time a blessing and a problem, rendering things all rather interesting. And proceedings could get vituperative before too long. Goyder has this past week foreshadowed that he won\u2019t seek re-election to the AFL\u2019s board of directors at its next annual general meeting. His impending exit can be attributed to a chairman finally deciphering the tea leaves conveying the message that his number might be up. His tenure has been anything but a straight path. Also, Goyder commenced as AFL Commission chair in 2017; these roles don\u2019t materialise regularly. AFL Commission chairman Richard Goyder at this year\u2019s hall of fame function. Credit: Getty It\u2019s plain that the process of choosing Goyder\u2019s replacement is as Byzantine as the plot of the 2025 Oscar-nominated movie, Conclave. It\u2019s a process that is also not entirely codified. Nature abhors a vacuum, and the pole that one must shimmy up to claim power is lathered in grease. How Goyder is succeeded, well, that\u2019s a murky process. Say what you want, but it\u2019s kind of mind-blowing that a billion-dollar company of such social standing in Australia as the AFL is, has no orderly succession plan in place.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that the candidates vying to fill the void do, or might include former AFL lawyer and Collingwood president, Jeff Browne; plaintiff-centric compo lawyer and former Western Bulldogs president Peter Gordon, and another certain former Collingwood chieftain and early dinnertime game show host Edward Joseph McGuire, AM. Assuming the accuracy of the registers maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, neither Browne nor McGuire has served as a director of the AFL; Gordon, however, did, between 1990 and 1993. Bringing any person in from outside the current cohort of AFL directors is a task mightily more difficult than it sounds. We\u2019re talking about a very particular type of billion-dollar business here. The sheer magnification of omnipresent public scrutiny, applied to decision-making, is manifest. Most corporate executives and professional directors would be chewed up and spat out sideways. Each potential candidate I\u2019ve named has done astonishing things professionally, and in some cases, other eyebrow-raising things that astonish. Browne has probably forgotten more about the intersection of sport, law, and business just in the last week than I\u2019ll ever know. If he\u2019s lost to the process through wicked political jiggery-pokery, the process is poorer and weaker for it.\n\nOn paper, any sport\u2019s governing body would be fortunate to have him as a director. But these things aren\u2019t ever a contest of achievements and excellence. It was Mario Puzo\u2019s Don Lucchese who put it best: \u201cmoney is a gun; politics is knowing when to pull the trigger\u201d. For a company of its standing in Australian society, the process of the AFL selecting a chairperson is remarkably unsophisticated. The AFL\u2019s constitution isn\u2019t a complex document. Essentially, it works this way: clause 60 of the AFL\u2019s constitution mandates the company must have between six and nine directors, although clause 75 then says the company in general meeting may increase (or reduce) that number. Presently, and by my count, the AFL has 10 directors. Former Collingwood president Eddie McGuire after the Magpies\u2019 finals win over Adelaide. Credit: AFL Photos At each AGM, two longest-serving directors \u2013 together with anyone else who hasn\u2019t faced the voters in three years \u2013 are compelled to retire from office. But there\u2019s no constitutional limit on the number of times a person can be re-elected. Clause 64 mandates that new, non-executive commissioners are elected by the \u201cAppointees\u201d, themselves being the voting representatives of each of the AFL\u2019s 18 clubs. If the total number of retiring directors offering themselves for re-election, and any new nominees not already directors, exceeds the number of vacant positions (being two), an election takes place. In secret.\n\nWhich conjures the adage that the only voters who\u2019ll tell you the truth about who they voted for are the ones who\u2019ll admit they voted for the other bloke. Sections 67(h) and (i) provide that the highest-polling candidates, in a first-past-the-post election, are declared elected, provided they also receive a majority of votes from the voting representatives of the 18 voting club representatives in attendance. Loading For all the talk about subcommittees vetting candidates and making recommendations to the AFL Commission, that\u2019s all convenient wallpapering in reality because pursuant to clause 70, any three clubs could band together and nominate anyone they wish to be elected. The AFL doesn\u2019t have an independence-rooted governing system or anything approaching it. Given that the clubs\u2019 Appointees also control the voting on candidates to elect as directors, the clubs wield enormous power. If it\u2019s true, the next AFL chair must come from the new directors to be elected \u2013 whether because none of the current directors want the job, or because the current cohort each know none of their own are up to it \u2013 the clubs hold four clean aces.",

She brings her film camera on nights out, to take photos of her friends and on holidays, like on her recent trip to Europe. \u201cIt captures the moment, you can\u2019t be like \u2018I look ugly\u2019 and re-take it\u2026 The photo is what it is,\u201d says Orrell, who has been on a break from Instagram because of the pressure to capture and share a \u2018perfect\u2019 moment. \u201cI look back through my parents\u2019 pictures, and it\u2019s all about the memory and not about performing. When I get to 60, I can look back at my film photos and reminisce,\u201d says Orrell. In August, photography company Eastman Kodak reported its quarterly filings, including significant debt, which led to news headlines that the company might be facing closure. Kodak called these media reports misleading and released a statement to clarify that \u201cKodak has no plans to cease operations\u201d and is \u201cconfident it will repay, extend, or refinance its debt.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, the iconic 133-year-old camera company had to temporarily pause its film production to make upgrades to its New York factory to keep up with the motion picture and still image film demands. \u201cIt\u2019s funny talking about what\u2019s going to happen in the future. We don\u2019t know. Pentax is the only manufacturer who have produced a film camera in 20 years,\u201d says Vlahadamis. Japanese camera manufacturer Pentax launched the Pentax 17 last year, the first new film camera from a major brand since the 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s a camera that shouldn\u2019t exist today. They have almost sold out globally. But as a major manufacturer, Pentax has gone out on a limb,\u201d says Vlahadamis. The stores street view; The well-stocked film fridge.

FujiFilm Australia\u2019s general manager Mary Georgievski says the product relaunch comes at a time of culture shift and taps into the younger generations\u2019 craving for nostalgia. \u201cGen Z are a lot about mental health, slowing things down, realising what we had in the past was great. While they\u2019re highly connected digitally, Gen Z is driving a renewed appreciation for analog, choosing film not in place of digital, but alongside it,\u201d says Georgievski. Film photography is experiencing a wave of revival at the same time as compact digital cameras. Both trends are trying to tell the same story \u2013 perhaps the instant gratification of a smartphone camera is no longer satisfying for young people.\n\nDenis Hasagic was originally saving up to buy a digital camera when he was actively searching for a hobby.

Credit: Abby Seaman Instead, the 25-year-old Sydney Super8 regular picked up his dad\u2019s old Pentax MZ-50 and started shooting film. Only four out of 37 photos turned out, but Hasagic was already hooked. \u201cI saved up all this money for a digital camera and then got a film camera for much cheaper and spent the extra money on film and development,\u201d says Hasagic who bought a Pentax P30. Although saving his money was short-lived.\n\nLoading \u201cAround the new year, I counted up how much I spent last year and it was about three or four grand. So probably double that.\u201d Hasagic loves that shooting on film forces a sort of mindfulness that makes you slow down and go with the flow. \u201cThere\u2019s also the surprise element. When you get the scans back and the photo you thought was going to be really good turns out bad, but the photo you took accidentally is really amazing,\u201d says Hasagic. Professional photographer Julia Sarantis, 29, says that mistakes are to be expected when working with film.\n\nJulia Sarantis outside of Sydney Super8 wearing a tie that previous owner Christopher Tiffany gifted her. Credit: Abby Seaman \u201cEven though it\u2019s heartbreaking, there are so many rolls [of film] that just didn\u2019t turn out ... but it\u2019s magic when it happens,\u201d she says. Sarantis accidentally discovered her love of film photography when taking a required university elective. \u201cAs soon as I got in the dark room and saw the magic of the development, I got hooked,\u201d says Sarantis. \u201cI\u2019ve always had an interest in old technology. But I think in a larger, cultural way it\u2019s a deviation from immediacy of digital technology,\u201d says Sarantis.",

Under the ministerial code of conduct, former ministers are not permitted to lobby within 18 months of leaving their position, and Hunt\u2019s advisory role explicitly ruled out lobbying. \u201cThere is therefore no conflict of any form nor could there be,\u201d his spokesman said. The spokesman said Hunt had not, to his knowledge, met, been lobbied by or received any campaign donations from Brethren individuals or entities as an MP, and had not referred any approach from Westlab for a COVID-19 contract to his department.\n\nThis masthead reported in July that Hunt also chairs a \u201ctelehealth sector working group\u201d, which is fully funded by medicinal cannabis giant Montu. Hunt said he was engaged as the independent chair of the group one day a month, with administrative support for the telehealth group being provided by Montu.

Credit: AAP A statement from Westlab said its dealings over the COVID-19 contracts were through nominated procurement panels and departmental officials, and \u201cas we understand, were completely in line with compliance measures required from all potential providers in an emergency situation\u201d. Westlab\u2019s financial report, lodged in 2022, shows its revenue increased by 926 per cent due to the pandemic between 2021 and 2022, from $52 million to $534 million. Soon after the pandemic ended, Westlab\u2019s co-owner and director, the Ballarat-based Brethren man, Gavin Grace, bought a luxury $14 million holiday home north-west of Sydney.\n\nLoading A statement from Grace, sent via a defamation lawyer, confirmed Hunt had \u201cworked with us since early 2023 in a clearly defined role of one day per month. His focus is on global healthcare and life sciences trends, providing strategic insights, participating and speaking at events\u201d. \u201cMr Hunt has made it very clear, and we were assured of this, that he had no involvement whatsoever in procurement decisions during the pandemic,\u201d Grace\u2019s statement said. \u201cThere is no conflict of interest here, real or perceived ... his contribution to Connected Global is solely about future innovation, not past government processes.\u201d Grace added that Hunt was \u201ceminently qualified for this role with our company ... and Connected Global is fortunate to benefit from his expertise\u201d.\n\nUnder the Morrison government\u2019s ministerial code of conduct, former ministers undertook not to lobby the government for 18 months, and not to take personal advantage of information they had access to as minister. This masthead is not suggesting Hunt has engaged in any wrongdoing, or breached the ministerial code. Gavin Grace is the Ballarat-based director of medical supply company Westlab.

Hunt has been providing advice to the company, including producing a \u201cwhite paper\u201d on the future of healthcare, identifying \u201cmegatrends\u201d in the sector. Greg Hunt at an event in July 2025. Hunt features prominently in Connected Global\u2019s marketing. On its website, under the heading \u201cAustralia\u2019s biomedical boom\u201d, Hunt is quoted as saying, \u201cresearch is the single best way to advance health and medical care\u201d, and setting out how government money is available to fund medical innovations. At the recent PharmOut conference, Hunt was billed as being from the \u201cUniversity of Melbourne and Connected\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, documents have revealed a Brethren company, Unispace \u2013 controlled by Gareth Hales, the son of Brethren leader Bruce Hales, and a British Brethren man \u2013 won contracts ultimately worth $1.2 billion after directly lobbying the then cabinet secretary, Michael Gove. Gove appears to have put them on the then-Tory government\u2019s so-called \u201cVIP Lane\u201d for procurement. COVID-19 contracts in Britain, including those fast-tracked in the VIP lane, are now subject to a special inquiry. In Australia, the Australian National Audit Office in 2021 found the government had received approaches from more than 4000 companies to supply the National Medical Stockpile. Pitches for contracts included \u201cdirect approaches to Health ... referrals from other Australian government entities, ministers\u2019 offices and ... approaches to market\u201d. Hunt\u2019s spokesman said the Labor member for Ballarat, Catherine King, had written to him in late 2021 after meeting with Westlab. \u201cAny such letter from the Labor member for Ballarat \u2026 would have been sent to the department under standard procedures,\u201d Hunt said.\n\nThe audit office concluded that procurement processes during the pandemic had been \u201clargely consistent with the proper use and management of public resources,\u201d though there had been \u201cinconsistent due diligence checks of suppliers\u201d. It found the \u201cappropriate delegate gave the approval [for contracts] in all instances\u201d. The statement from Westlab said that, during the pandemic, \u201cat no point did Westlab, its directors, staff, or shareholders approach Greg Hunt or any government minister\u201d, and any such inference was \u201ccategorically false\u201d. During the pandemic in Australia, Westlab worked directly in partnership with a company called Sante, run by Gareth Hales. Sante and Westlab supplied PPE and RATs to the government, some of which were co-branded. Hales campaigned prominently for the Liberal Party in the recent federal election campaign, and was pictured handing out leaflets in the seat of Bennelong. This masthead reported this month that some Liberal Party campaigners were deeply concerned about the party\u2019s relationship with the church. Former minister Linda Reynolds has asked for its role in this year\u2019s election to be examined in the party\u2019s review of its disastrous loss.\n\nLoading Bruce Hales, the leader of the Brethren church \u2013 described by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May as a cult \u2013 was Westlab\u2019s \u201cindependent auditor\u201d in 2022, according to company accounts. Westlab, in its statement, claimed a senior registered auditor from Hales\u2019 firm, \u201cnot Mr Bruce Hales himself\u201d conducted the audit. The audit was \u201cperformed in accordance with ASIC and other regulatory standards\u201d, Westlab said. However, Hales is registered as an individual auditor with ASIC and it appears he personally signed the 2022 accounts. Hales runs the church, of which Grace is a member, under extremely strict rules and can excommunicate wayward members, cutting them off from their families, their businesses and all their friends.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Ever since hearing the priest utter \u201cmawage\u201d in The Princess Bride, I\u2019ve been a sucker for wedding movies \u2013 from gushy romcoms such as Mamma Mia! and The Proposal to wacky matrimonial adventures like Palm Springs and Corpse Bride. But very soon, I\u2019ll go from watching other brides to walking down the aisle myself. Since planning my own wedding, I can\u2019t watch these movies the same way. Everything that was once funny \u2013 say, a soiled wedding dress or a sabotaging maid of honour \u2013 suddenly fills me with sheer horror. In contrast, the once-boring happy endings have me itching to, as Beyonc\u00e9 would say, put a ring on it. From Father of the Bride to Bridesmaids, wedding movies tell a very different story when you\u2019re about to walk down the aisle yourself. Credit: Compiled by Matt Davidson. So, here are nine wedding films I\u2019ve watched ahead of getting hitched, and what they\u2019ve taught me about being a bride. Father of the Bride (1991) A remake of the 1950 classic, this Steve Martin caper has always been one of my favourites. But watching it as a bride-to-be is an entirely different (and emotional) kettle of fish. Martin plays an overprotective father who learns his 22-year-old daughter got engaged during a semester abroad in Rome. While attempting to come to terms with \u201closing his little girl\u201d, he subconsciously tries to sabotage the wedding, only to eventually realise he has to let her go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m my father\u2019s youngest daughter, so this hits home hard. As exciting as the big day is for the couple, it can be incredibly emotional for the parents, who probably still see you as an 11-year-old laughing along to The Princess Bride. I\u2019ll be sure to hug my dad extra tight on my wedding day. Muriel\u2019s Wedding (1994) This Aussie classic is the perfect cautionary tale for any bride-to-be. Muriel (Toni Collette) is desperate to be \u201csomebody\u201d and believes a spectacular wedding will do just the trick. But when she eventually has her so-called perfect wedding with a South African swimmer in need of an Australian passport, she quickly realises a big bash wedding can\u2019t truly change her life. A great wedding does not a perfect life make. Muriel learned that the hard way. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo I now know how easy it is to obsess over every tiny wedding detail, and to believe the smallest hitch means you\u2019ve failed as a bride. But, ultimately, who cares if the cake is slightly lopsided, or one of your guests makes an embarrassing impromptu speech? A wedding doesn\u2019t define your worth. Thanks for taking one for the team, Muriel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy Best Friend\u2019s Wedding (1997) While I once loved watching Julia Roberts\u2019 attempt to steal her best friend from his fianc\u00e9e just days before his wedding, it has since become my nightmare. Roberts plays a food critic who realises she still has feelings for her best friend/ex-partner when he announces his engagement to someone else. So, she proceeds to try to split the couple up in various sneaky, cruel ways. Now, there won\u2019t be any exes at my wedding, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019ve ever wronged somebody on the guest list \u2013 someone who has been waiting for the perfect time to strike. The one thing from this film that I\u2019d accept with open arms, however, is the scene in which the family randomly bursts into I Say a Little Prayer at the dinner table. I\u2019ll take any excuse to turn my life into a musical. The Wedding Singer (1998)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, the mullets. So many mullets. Adam Sandler plays a wedding singer who is suddenly ditched by his fianc\u00e9e, turning him into a cynical marriage-hater. That is, until he meets a wedding waitress (Drew Barrymore) who essentially teaches him to love again. The only hitch? She\u2019s engaged to someone else. Beyond the horrific hairstyles (thankfully my fianc\u00e9 simply wouldn\u2019t have time to grow a mullet even if he wanted to now), this film legitimately steered me away from hiring a singer on the off chance they\u2019re having a rough day and decide to take it out on my guests. This movie also makes it clear working in the wedding industry can be a tough and thankless gig, especially if you\u2019re heartbroken and constantly surrounded by love. There will be nothing but respect for the staff at my wedding. My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) My family may not be Greek, but they are loud. So, watching this film offers a glimpse into how my fianc\u00e9 may be feeling knowing he\u2019s entering into this crazy crew. Power to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading Jokes aside, this movie is a beautiful snapshot of two families and cultures coming together through marriage despite their differences. I grew up watching it for the hilarious interactions between the Greek aunties, but now I watch it as a reminder that a wedding doesn\u2019t only unite the bride and groom, but also the families themselves. It\u2019s also the reason we\u2019ve added lamb to our menu. 27 Dresses (2008) I\u2019ve probably seen this movie as many times as Katherine Heigl\u2019s character has been a bridesmaid. Jane is a chronic people-pleaser who has been a bridesmaid 27 times \u2013 the classic \u201calways a bridesmaid, never a bride\u201d. She becomes the subject of columnist Kevin\u2019s next story once he finds out she\u2019s kept all 27 of her horrendously ugly bridesmaids dresses.\n\nAdvertisement",
