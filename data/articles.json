        "text": "A woman in Texas is suing the state's Lottery Commission for not paying out a US$83.5 million ($128.6m) award, more than three months after the numbers on her ticket matched the winning numbers in a draw, according to court documents obtained by CNN .\n\n\"Every Texan knows what that should mean when it comes to the lottery \u2013 if you win, you should get paid,\" the suit says.\n\n\"It shouldn't take a lawsuit to get paid when you win the lottery. But that's exactly what has happened here.\"\n\nA printed ticket from a Texas Lottery sales terminal at Fuel City in Dallas. (AP)\n\nThe woman bought her ticket through a lottery courier service, firms which allow customers to purchase tickets virtually, using a mobile app or other online interface.\n\nThe woman, identified only as Jane Doe in the suit, purchased a ticket for the \"Lotto Texas\" lottery game through an app called Jackpocket on February 17, and her numbers matched those of the numbers pulled at 10.12pm (local time) the same day, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA week after Doe won her ticket, then-Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Ryan Mindell announced a move to ban courier services like the one Doe used, under Texas law.\n\nThe ban became effective on May 19, according to a lottery commission spokesperson. Mindell resigned in April.\n\nHer ticket matched the winning numbers in a draw, according to court documents . (Getty)\n\n\"We all know the Commission is not allowed to change the rules after the drawing. But the Commission has apparently tried to do so and relied \u2013 at least in part \u2013 on this ex post facto announcement to continue to refuse to pay plaintiff her lottery winnings simply because she utilised a lottery ticket courier service to buy the winning ticket,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nA spokesperson told CNN in an email Saturday the commission \"does not comment on pending litigation.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges Doe's unpaid winnings could be used to pay other Texas Lottery winners, or may be reallocated and redirected to \"other commission liabilities or purposes,\" potentially reducing the amount owed to her.\n\nAttorneys for the woman have also filed for a temporary restraining order and requested for a temporary injunction to stop Acting Deputy Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission Sergio Rey from doling out funds, which the lawsuit alleges Doe still has not received.\n\n\"If Mr Rey is not restrained and enjoined from disbursing or diminishing the plaintiff's jackpot prize winnings, plaintiff will suffer damages that will be incapable of being measured by any certain pecuniary standard before notice is given and a hearing is held on plaintiff's application for temporary injunction,\" a court document said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office, Jackpocket, and Rey for comment.\n\nWhat is a lottery courier service?\n\nA lottery courier service acts as a third-party vendor that buys lottery tickets on behalf of customers, coordinates the purchase of physical tickets through brick and mortar stores the services often own, and notifies buyers if they win.\n\nCourier services are typically operated online or through an app, offering a convenient way to play games. Some couriers even offer national lottery games like Mega Millions and Powerball.\n\nLottery couriers, which had been operating in Texas since 2019, became a focus in April 2023 after a single entity bought 25 million lottery tickets in less than 72 hours using a courier service, CNN affiliate WFAA reported.\n\nThe entity purchased \"nearly every possible number combination,\" the release from the governor's office said at the time. The investor doubled its money because the jackpot was so high, and the winner took home US$89 million before taxes, WFAA said.\n\nCourier services are operating in 19 states, according to a report published in 2024 by the Florida Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability.\n\nOnly three states \u2013 New York, New Jersey and Arkansas \u2013 regulate the courier service industry, according to a 2024 Texas House report. Without such regulations in Texas, couriers are not required to obtain a licence or permission from the Texas Lottery to operate, the report found.\n\nPurchasing via a lottery courier has two advantages for the customer, said Victor Matheson, professor of economics at College of the Holy Cross.\n\n\"It allows the buyer to conveniently buy tickets without having to go to a regular lottery retailer and it also potentially allows out-of-state buyers to purchase tickets in any lottery across the country,\" Matheson said in February.\n\nThe service can have drawbacks like a fee, legality issues and lack of a limit to how many tickets are purchased, Matheson added. Other legal concerns include the regulation of sales across state lines when each state controls its own lottery games, sales to underage players, ticket buying syndicates and other issues.",

They just kicked me out for no reason whatsoever.\" \ufeff\n\nAfter some time on the market, the property's rent was reduced to $700 per week.\n\nMannan luckily found another rental just 150 metres down the road from his former address.\n\nIn the end, he lost about $630 of his bond to repairs and over $300 for moving fees.\n\nNew rental reforms that ended no-grounds evictions came into effect in NSW this week.\n\nNow, agents and landlords are required to \ufeffprovide a specific reason for eviction, including a tenant breaching their lease, damaging the property or not paying rent, the landlord wanting to sell the property or the property no longer being used as a rental.\n\nAgents and landlords who fail to comply will be dealt with under the Rental Taskforce. \ufeff\n\n\"For too long, renters have lived with the fear of being kicked out for no reason. That ends today,\" Housing and Homelessness Minister Rose Jackson said earlier this week.\n\nWhile the changes were welcomed by some, Mannan \ufeffsaid he did not believe they would have much material change because landlords could still decide to increase the rent, effectively evicting tenants who cannot afford the hike, or sell the property.\n\n\"I\ufeff know, in the paper and in the books, it looks really nice... but it doesn't secure us. We need more property to be built, it's a simple solution. There's no supply,\" he said.",

(AP)\n\nA new BBC documentary into the disaster gained access to material from the US Coast Guard's (USCG) investigation.\n\nFootage obtained by the USCG shows Wendy Rush, the wife of Rush, listening to the sound of the implosion while watching on from the sub's support vessel and asking: \"What was that bang?\"\n\nShe is shown sitting in front of a computer that was sending and receiving text messages from Titan about 90 minutes in from when it started its dive.\n\nA noise sounding like a door slamming is heard when the submersible reaches a depth of 3300 metres, prompting her to look up and ask other OceanGate crew what the noise was.\n\nMoments later, Wendy Rush receives a text message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights, which apparently caused her to mistakenly believe the dive was proceeding safely.\n\nBut the USCG says the noise was in fact the sound of Titan imploding.\n\nOfficials say the text message, which must have been sent just before the sub hit disaster, took longer to reach the ship than the sound of the implosion.\n\nThe five aboard were, from left, pilot Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate; French explorer and Titanic expert Paul-Henry Nargeolet\ufeff; British adventurer and billionaire Hamish Harding; and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman. (9News)\n\nStockton Rush and the four other people aboard - businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman Dawood; businessman Hamish Harding; and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet - died instantly.\n\nEarlier this year at the USCG hearings into the disaster, a damning portrait of the Washington-based company that developed and operated the submersible as well as its founder \u2013 who charged passengers about $US250,000 (nearly $400,000) per dive - emerged from testimonies.\n\nAfter the submersible lost contact with its mother ship and failed to resurface, a dramatic international search and rescue mission unfolded in the remote waters several hundred kilometres south-east of Newfoundland.\n\nAuthorities concluded the vessel had suffered a \"catastrophic implosion,\" a sudden inward collapse caused by immense pressure.\n\nThe USGC investigation has centred on the design of the Titan, built from carbon fibre, an unusual material for deep sea submersible crafts.\n\nRemains of the Titan submersible on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. (US Coast Guard Video via Pelagic Research Services)\n\nA known problem is that carbon fibre layers can separate under pressure, a process called delamination.\n\nUSGC investigators believe the Titan's structure showed signs of weakening in 2022 after the craft completed its 80th expedition.\n\nPassengers reported hearing a loud bang as the sub returned to the surface.\n\nThey were told by Stockton Rush that this noise was the sub shifting in its frame.\n\nBut the USCG says the data collected from sensors fitted to Titan shows that the bang was caused by delamination.\n\nThe US Coast Guard will publish a final report bout its investigation later this year.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

(ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\nNow that VAD is legal across much of the country, statistics on how many Australians are still going to Switzerland are hard to come by.\n\nPhilip Nitschke, who has been the subject of long-running controversy, founded Exit International to advocate for end-of-life services around the world.\n\nHe estimated about one to two Australians are continuing to travel abroad to end their lives each month.\n\nBut even he, a vocal supporter of VAD, said dementia posed a particularly difficult problem.\n\nMr Griffiths will be assessed for dementia in the next year. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\nAn advance request\n\nDementia now ranks among the leading causes of death across many developed nations.\n\nWith rates only set to increase, health departments all over the world are grappling with the question of VAD for those with the disorder.\n\nBut relevant Australian peak bodies, including Dementia Australia, Council on the Ageing and Palliative Care Australia, said they were neutral on the subject.\n\nThe Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium allow VAD for dementia patients through an Advance Care Directive, a legal document setting out a person's healthcare wishes for when they can no longer make them.\n\nBut uptake has been low.\n\nAuthorities are grappling with the question of VAD for people with dementia. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\nDementia patients constituted only 3.7 per cent of all VAD deaths in the Netherlands in 2023.\n\nIn Belgium only 0.95 per cent of VAD deaths were people with cognitive disorders, including many forms of dementia, between 2018 and 2021.\n\nIn both cases, most patients had only early-stage dementia.\n\nLoved ones back out\n\nDr Ladd said many doctors and loved ones baulked at the idea of ending the life of a person \"who doesn't know what's going on\".\n\nShe cited a Dutch study that found three in four relatives of nursing home residents with advanced dementia asked physicians not to act on their loved ones' request for VAD through Advance Care Directives.\n\nAnother study found support for the idea dropped dramatically once survey participants were given specific scenarios and asked whether VAD should be administered.\n\n\"Public acceptance \u2026 has been shown to decrease significantly when the situation moves from being a theoretical question to a lived reality,\" she wrote.\n\nMr Griffiths fears the loss of autonomy that comes with dementia. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\nThere are also legal issues.\n\nIn the Netherlands in 2016, a criminal investigation was launched into a physician who complied with an elderly dementia patient's Advance Care Directive, after it emerged the patient pulled away when given the fatal dose.\n\nPhilosophical questions\n\nAlong with practical hurdles, Dr Ladd said Dutch ethicists were grappling with philosophical questions.\n\nThey ask whether a person who draws up an Advance Care Directive is still the same person once dementia takes hold, and whether it is possible for a competent person to foresee what life with dementia would be like.\n\nIf the answer to either question is \"no\", it may invalidate the document.\n\nThe family, and dog Millie, meet outside Rachel's aged care home. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\n\"They're not just medical issues. They're not just legal issues,\" Dr Ladd said.\n\n\" They're really knotty ethical issues as well. \"\n\nA technical solution\n\nDr Nitschke believed while the Dutch should be commended for grappling with VAD for dementia patients, problems would always arise in \"outsourcing death\".\n\nHe believed technology would provide a better option.\n\nMr Griffiths sits with Rachel (left) and their daughter Deryn. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\n\"Instead of outsourcing your death to someone else, like the medical profession, you're taking responsibility for your own death,\" Dr Nitschke said.\n\nHis approach has been disputed in the past.\n\nLast year, his organisation opened The Last Resort, designed to let people die for free using specially designed pods.\n\nBut after one was used successfully, several staff were detained on suspicion of aiding and abetting suicide. They were eventually released.\n\nMr Griffiths is a former university lecturer. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\nDr Nitschke argued it was important to give people options, and noted a key benefit of the Dutch system was the peace of mind it offered, particularly after a dementia diagnosis.\n\n\"That's by far the biggest benefit we're seeing in the Netherlands,\" he said.\n\n\" It does give people comfort to know that they've signed a piece of paper, even though there might be a thin chance that anyone will act on it. \"\n\n'A great comfort'\n\nIt would certainly be a comfort to Mr Griffiths.\n\nThe Melbourne man said he did not know how Australian VAD laws should be written, or what he would do when \"push comes to shove\".\n\nBut he said he would not make any decision about his own death until his wife had passed away.\n\n\"I think it'd be a bit selfish to go before she does,\" he said.\n\nMr Griffiths adores his wife, Rachel. (ABC Melbourne: Danielle Bonica)\n\nWhen the end is approaching, he said it would be a relief to know he could die on his own terms with dementia in Australia.\n\n\"Very much so,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone says once you get the OK it gives you a lot of peace.\n\n\"Whether or not you access it or not is not such a big drama.\n\n\" I think it would be a great comfort. \"",

(ABC: Chopsticks or Fork)\n\nShe said they signified the contribution of Chinese immigration to regional communities, which stepped up in the 1970s.\n\n\"Back then there were probably only about 50,000 people of Chinese heritage in the country, and there would have been around 13 or 14 million Australian people, so a very tiny per cent of the population,\" Wong said.\n\n\" And yet, if you talk to anyone who grew up in the 70s their first memory of going out to eat would most likely have been at a Chinese restaurant. \"\n\nShe said many would have happy memories of meals in those dining rooms, even as tastes had started to change.\n\nA Sundoo postcard shows the decor in the 1980s.

He was 85.\n\nProfessor Eastman's life work was the prevention of iodine deficiency, especially in pregnant women, which leads to intellectual and physical disabilities in children.\n\nIt followed his discovery that the trace element in minuscule but daily doses was crucial to healthy brain function.\n\n\"You could put the whole amount of iodine you need for a lifetime into a teaspoon,\" Professor Eastman told Richard Fidler on Conversations in 2015, \"so long as you don't take it all at once\".\n\n\"It's absolutely essential for a normal life.\"\n\nProfessor Creswell Eastman grew up in Lismore. (ABC RN)\n\nFriend and colleague Graeme Stuart said the significance of Professor Eastman's work improving the lives of millions of people could not be overstated.\n\n\"How many people in medicine and medical science could claim to have such an extraordinary impact? He would be there with a very small number, both in Australia and globally,\" Professor Stuart said.\n\n\"He was one of the most compassionate physicians that I've ever known, and an outstanding clinician in his ability to look after the whole patient.\"\n\nProfessor Stuart and other colleagues remembered the oft-quoted mantra he lived by: \"The most basic human right you've got is the chance to fulfil your genetic potential\".\n\nProfessor Eastman spent his career ensuring that potential was realised in people across Australia and Asia.\n\nGround-breaking work\n\nDuring a visit to Sarawak in Malaysia in the early 1980s to study people with goitres, a swelling of the thyroid gland, Professor Eastman discovered a widespread deficiency of iodine in the diet.\n\nWhile helping to fix the plumbing at one village, he facilitated the addition of iodine to the water supply. Twelve months later, goitres had all but disappeared in the village's young children.\n\nThis led the Malaysian government to legalise the importation of only iodised salt to Sarawak.\n\nProfessor Eastman's work identified the effects of iodine deficiencies. (Supplied: The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)\n\nIn China in the 1980s, Professor Eastman found one quarter of the population of more than a billion people had goitres, and of those, he estimated tens of millions had some form of brain damage.\n\n\"I went through some form of epiphany here, I thought, 'what's the point of just doing research here? We've got to translate that research into public health',\" he said on Conversations.\n\nProfessor Eastman examining Tibetan schoolchildren for goitre in Tibet in May 2000.

(Supplied: Creswell Eastman)\n\nHowever, with the rising popularity of gourmet salts, Professor Eastman remained concerned that pregnant women in Australia were not eating enough iodised salt.\n\nHis daughter Kate Eastman said her father was renowned for pulling the iodised salt to the front of supermarket shelves and hiding the non-iodised product.\n\n\"I was pregnant with my daughter, who is now 20. At that time, pink salt was very fashionable. I did not hear the end of it,\" Ms Eastman said.\n\n\"He accused me and my sister of our love of pink rock salt and fancy gourmet salts as being 'an aberration' \u2026 and his grandchildren were not suffering from any iodine deficiency.\n\n\"My father's message, if you had his words ringing in your ears, it's use iodised salt. So if you're in the supermarket \u2026 always get the iodised salt.\"\n\nA fondness for Lismore\n\nCreswell Eastman was born in Narrandera on March 30, 1940, to Albert and Margaret Eastman.\n\nJust after World War II, the family moved to Evans Head, where they lived in a tent, before moving to Lismore.\n\nSuch was the housing shortage, the family lived in a fully furnished tent until a house became available.\n\nAlways a bright student, a young Creswell won two scholarships from the New South Wales government and the board of education to further his studies.\n\nLegacy also helped pay for his education after his grandfather died when he was 11.\n\nHe married Annette Delaney, also from Lismore, and the couple had four children; Kate, Damien, Pip, and Nick.\n\nProfessor Eastman with wife Annette and children Nick, Pip, and Damien receiving his Officer of the Order of Australia.

        "text": "A pilot program designed to reduce paediatric wait times in Tasmania was abruptly ended six months early, according to one of the doctors involved.\n\nThe General Practitioners with Special Interest (GPwSI) project was part of a broader strategy to address wait times in outpatient clinics across the state.\n\nThe idea was to place doctors with a specific interest in a range of outpatient clinics like antenatal, cardiology and mental health services to come up with new models of care.\n\nThe GPs would be working between half a day to two days a week.\n\nPaediatrician shortage leaves 3,300 children on wait list Photo shows A mum at a table watches over her two children painting A retiring paediatrician says the Tasmanian health system is prioritising children with physical complaints rather than developmental issues.\n\nAccording to the Health Department, the funding for the entire program was equivalent to employing two full-time GPs for two years.\n\nThe ABC has been told that while doctors were offered shorter contracts, some were led to believe the pilot program would run for two years, until June 2025, and were shocked when it ended sooner than expected.\n\nTim Jones is one of the doctors who was employed as part of the pilot in mid-2023.\n\nDoctor Tim Jones says waiting times for some patients fell from two years to less than three months. (Supplied: Tim Jones)\n\nHe was placed at the Royal Hobart Hospital (RHH) paediatric clinic.\n\n\"Because of my natural scope being more linked to younger kids, I prioritised seeing any child of seven or under who was on our waitlist here in southern Tasmania,\" Dr Jones said.\n\n\" In the 18 months \u2026 we managed to reduce that wait time [for children seven and under] from over two years to essentially less than three months for those kids to be assessed and supported. \"\n\nWhile not a fully qualified paediatrician, Dr Jones was able to provide broader assessments, looking at the child's environment, family and school and then linking them up with the support they needed.\n\n\"We could tease out which kids needed which layer of support,\" he said.\n\n\"That meant the kids that did need to go through and have a full formal ADHD [or autism] assessment, we could screen them out and make sure they then got that assessment, whereas kids who needed other pathways, we made sure they got timely access to those services.\"\n\nHarry had to ask his parents to stop hugging him Photo shows Harry Dannock in karate uniform. Harry was 10 when clenching his fists during karate classes became difficult. But the real turning point came when he asked his parents to stop hugging him because it hurt too much.\n\nOften, Dr Jones said, the primary problem was not attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism, but things like poor sleep patterns, inadequate supports in school and dyslexia.\n\nBy managing to filter out those who could be assisted by other services, it meant children who needed more complex assessments could see a paediatrician in a more timely manner.\n\nThen in November, Dr Jones was told his position could no longer be funded, and his contract would not be extended and would end in January.\n\nDr Jones said he had been told from the beginning, including during the interview, that the program would run until the end of June this year.\n\nThe ABC understands other GPs with specific interests were told similar things.\n\n\"What we found was that a lot of the GPs were able to \u2026integrate well with the systems and start to deliver some outcomes, so it came as a shock to all of us that we received limited notice that the funding was not to be continued past the 18 month mark,\" DrJones said.\n\nLong waits for consultation\n\nAccording to the Health Department, wait times in Tasmania for a non-urgent patient to see a public paediatrician can last close to two years.\n\nThat varies depending on where in the state the person is.\n\nAnna Nottage says Dr Jones was a \"great support\" while she and daughter Lottie were on a waitlist to see a paediatrician. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nThe private system is no better, as Anna Nottage knows. When her daughter Lottie was aged two, she tried to get her into a paediatrician, concerned about her delayed development.\n\nShe was referred to a private clinic and the public one at the Royal. Both had extensive waitlists.\n\nIn the meantime, Ms Nottage and Lottie were able to see Dr Jones, who was working at the developmental clinic at the RHH.\n\nLottie needed to see a paediatrician, but her mother says using the pilot program in the meantime was helpful. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nWhile Lottie turned out to be one of the complex cases who did need to be seen by a paediatrician, Ms Nottage said being able to discuss her concerns with Dr Jones was reassuring.\n\n\"He was a great support,\" she said.\n\n\" Without that program, I don't know where we would've been. \"\n\nMs Nottage is urging the Health Department to keep the program for children like Lottie. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\n'Early intervention key': Labor\n\nLabor's Shadow Health Minister Ella Haddad said it was disappointing for Tasmanian families waiting in that system that the program had ended.\n\n\"This is a program that was actually having a tangible effect on [those long waitlists],\" she said.\n\n\"For that to be cut, we know the wait times are just going to get longer and harder for Tasmanians who already need these services early.\n\n\" It's really important to remember that early intervention is key when it comes to diagnosis and treatment of things like ADHD and other neurodiverse conditions. \"\n\nIn April, the state government opened a specialist service for children and young people with suspected ADHD in the south, and there are plans to expand statewide.\n\nIt also includes funding for two GPs with special interests in ADHD.\n\nBut that service will not help kids like Lottie, who was eventually diagnosed with autism and is now seeing one of the new paediatricians at a private clinic.\n\nLottie was eventually diagnosed with autism. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\n\"There are a lot of parents probably going through the same thing,\" Ms Nottage said.\n\n\"They haven't got a paediatrician and need that stopgap for children with behavioural or developmental needs.\n\n\" Keep [the program]. It needs to stay. \"\n\nDepartment evaluation underway\n\nIn a statement, a Health Department spokesperson said they acknowledged the positive impact the GPwSI model of care pilot had caused for \"some patients, particularly in paediatrics\".\n\nThe spokesperson said an evaluation of the broader pilot was being finalised, which would provide guidance on how the department \"can best utilise the state's highly-skilled GPwSI and rural generalist workforce across our health service\".",

        "text": "Jason Martin has been searching since November for an apartment in the northern suburbs of Sydney near his daughter's school.\n\nHe wants a two-bedroom place in Epping, but with many exceeding his $800,000 budget, he knows he'll need to compromise.\n\nThis might mean choosing a property with building defects or opting for a one-bedroom apartment with a study area that fits a bed.\n\nBut he's struggling to find something he really likes in his price range.\n\n\"I always thought I'd buy something that I'd fallen in love with. But I haven't found anything worth fighting for,\" he told the ABC.\n\nMany first-home buyers are hoping to find a property within their limited price range. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut the cash rate again, bringing it down to 3.85 per cent \u2014 the lowest in two years \u2014 with future rate cuts on the cards.\n\nLower interest rates enhance buyers' borrowing capacity, spark buyer activity, fuel competition, and drive up home prices, which are already at record highs.\n\nIn April, Australia's median home price reached a new record of $805,000, according to PropTrack.\n\nMr Martin is aware his mission has become harder.\n\n\"Interest rate cuts benefit existing mortgage holders, but for first-time buyers, they raise property prices. The last RBA rate cut seemed to increase some prices by $40,000.\"\n\nFuture rate cuts are on the cards, likely sparking buyer activity. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nBuying homes 'they're not even sure they want'\n\nBroker Alya Manji from Aussie Home Loans Hurstville said there's roughly \"an eight-week window\" to buy after a rate cut before its effects hit the market.\n\n\"If you don't act within that time, it gets tougher,\" she said.\n\nShe said a 0.25 per cent rate cut could increase someone's borrowing power by $10,000 to $25,000 on a $500,000 loan. But at the same time, house prices could move by that same amount or more.\n\n\" I see buyers feeling such FOMO that they sign on properties they're not even sure they want. They feel there's no choice. \"\n\nRate cuts can increase a person's borrowing power, but there can be consequences, noted broker Alya Manji. (Supplied)\n\nPrices to keep rising\n\nNicola Powell, Domain's chief of research and economics, said a downward rate cycle and persistent housing shortages would keep driving property prices up.\n\n\"A rate cut prompts buyers to act quickly, fearing further price increases.\n\n\"Buyer inquiry volumes are up year-on-year in all of our capital cities,\" Dr Powell said.\n\nNicola Powell says a rate cut often prompts buyers to act quickly. (Supplied)\n\nSenior economist at REA Group Eleanor Creagh agreed two rate cuts this year and the prospect of more would boost demand \u2014 and therefore prices \u2014 when there aren't enough homes to go around.\n\n\"In terms of housing supply, we've still got constraints on the delivery of new homes, particularly in major capitals.\"\n\nOther factors fuelling FOMO\n\nRate cuts and housing shortages aren't the only factors driving buyer FOMO.\n\nThe Labor government's election win means its First Home Guarantee scheme will be extended to allow a larger pool of buyers to purchase with as little as a 5 per cent deposit, without Lenders Mortgage Insurance, from July 1.\n\nWhile this helps more first-home buyers, it intensifies competition.\n\nWith constraints on the delivery of new homes in major capitals, many housing lots are being built in the outer suburbs. (ABC News: Monish Nand)\n\nMeg Elkins, a behavioural economist at RMIT, said supporting first-time buyers while not propping up prices artificially \"is a very difficult balancing act\".\n\n\"We know that if you increase subsidies around housing, it can increase capacity around borrowing and push up those prices.\"\n\nDr Elkins added that millennial first-home buyers were also feeling external pressures to reach life milestones.\n\nMeg Elkins says the pressure on millennial first-home buyers is particularly intense. (Supplied)\n\n\"Many millennials feel they should own property by 30,\" she said.\n\n\"And they're facing the toughest purchasing conditions in history, with high interest rates, living costs and student debt combined with stagnant wage growth.\n\n\"They're so badly done by.\"\n\nIf those conditions weren't tough enough for buyers, the market has become swamped with buyers' agents, who \"can easily outplay regular bidders\", Ms Manji said.\n\nBuyers' agents often have close ties with agents, and they know how to negotiate.\n\nPlus, they've significantly enlarged the buyer pool by acting on the ground for remote clients.\n\n\"Buyers are now facing competition from people across Australia and beyond,\" Ms Manji said.\n\nSome economists think house prices will rise by about 5 per cent by year's end. (ABC News: Elise Pianegonda)\n\nWhat can buyers do?\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. The prospect of higher prices following another rate cut could entice more people to list their properties for sale, boosting supply.\n\nProperty price rises of about 5% expected by year's end Photo shows an outside view of a row of houses Cheaper money for housing, amid a market with high demand and low supply, will keep fuelling property prices.\n\nAnother factor restraining price growth is, of course, affordability. The Housing Industry Association reported affordability was at a 30-year low in the second half of last year.\n\n\"I think we're all a bit scared after the cash rate hikes, cost of living pressures and wages growth that hasn't kept up with price growth,\" Dr Powell said.\n\nDr Elkins suggested researching available government grants, enlisting the help of a buyer's agent, or considering that dreaded word among buyers: compromise.\n\n\"You may not get exactly what you want. So what are you willing to give up to get closer to your ideal?\"\n\nMr Martin isn't prepared to compromise on location or buy a property he dislikes \u2014 and he knows that comes with consequences.\n\n\"There is definitely a FOMO because the prices will rise, potentially pricing me out,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very frustrating. If this goes on for another few months, I'll be locked out of the market.\"",

Make sure that you're storing the receipts digitally.\"\n\n\n\nPrepare your work from home record\n\nIn general, there are two different methods you can use to claim your work from home-related deductions: First, gathering all the information about your expenses for the time you worked from home, and second, providing the total hours you worked remotely to the ATO.\n\n\n\n\n\nHabibian suggests gathering this information as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes it might be a bit time-consuming to find the detailed record of a daily log of the hours that you worked from home, and also evidence of the expenses like electricity, internet, and phone,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This document actually takes more time to collect and provide to the tax agent.\"\n\n\n\nSeparate your personal and business expenses\n\nIf you own a business and have not yet separated your personal and business expenses, this might be a great time to start, as it may take up a lot of your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Separating your personal [expenses] from the business expenses would be highly important,\" Habibian said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of the people have their personal and business expenses mixed, and it will take a huge amount of time to separate them.\"\n\n\n\nGenerally, the distinction between personal and business expenses is straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases intended for business use are deductible business expenses, while items bought for personal use are classified as personal expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an item that serves both business and personal purposes, like a laptop or a phone, you can only deduct the portion used for business.\n\n\n\nDocument your other sources of income\n\nWith only one source of income and a limited number of work-related expenses, the tax return process may not take much time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if you have multiple income sources, Habibian said you should start your preparation sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have an investment property, you need to gather information,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make sure that you are focusing on the rental property claims as well ... That would actually be a bit time-consuming. You need to have a chat with your real estate agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You need to start from now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same goes for other investments like cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have crypto that is in the radar of the ATO, you need to gather information about it ... If you are trading crypto, you must report it even if you have made a loss,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDon't rush\n\nTax time starts on the first of July each year and finishes by the end of October.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy mid-July, once employers and banks have submitted more information to the ATO, the prefilled data will be available for your tax lodgement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people rush to lodge on the first of July ... But you should avoid loading these documents too early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This reduces the errors and avoids later amendments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice. You should consult with a licenced professional to make the decisions that are right for you.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "In her first year of university, when Natasha Jiwani should have been revelling in her new-found independence, she started to experience constant abdominal pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I straight after finishing high school, first year of university would get severe abdominal pain to the point where I would wake up with it and go to sleep with it. No one could diagnose what it was.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, Natasha was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The overall experience was quite different. So, walking into a gastroenterologist waiting room, I'd look around and I was the only one that was in my close to 20's. Everybody else, the average age was 60 onwards, so there was a lot of confusion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCrohn's disease and ulcerative colitis both fall under the umbrella term of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or IBD \u2014 an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the gut.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease can cause inflammation anywhere in the digestive system, though it usually affects the bowels.\n\n\n\n\n\nUlcerative colitis, often referred to simply as \"colitis\", can cause inflammation and ulcers in the colon and rectum.\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent Ho, a gastroenterologist at Western Sydney University, says both conditions cause multiple symptoms including diarrhea and abdominal pain, though to others they remain invisible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People with inflammatory bowel disease may look perfectly fine but are actually suffering from the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, which can be quite severe in many cases and affect their daily life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of Australians living with I-B-D is rapidly on the rise, increasing from 100,000 a decade or so ago to around 180,000 today, according to a recent State of the Nation Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat number is expected to rise to 200,000 in the next 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Ho says the rates of IBD in Australia are among the highest in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over 65, we're seeing more cases, but we're also seeing cases of inflammatory bowel disease in young children as well. And there are a number of cases of what we call very early onset in inflammatory bowel disease where children can get it a younger than six years of age.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ho say, while it's largely unknown how this inflammation arises, we are starting to learn more about its causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some risk factors in the environment include exposure to tobacco smoke, the use of antibiotics, the use of certain drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example Nurofen, Voltaren, those sorts of drugs. We know that some types of infections can increase the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother risk factor is diet.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne recent world-first pre clinical study, by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, shows how eating just a few meals high in saturated fats, can cause inflammation in the body.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose foods can also weaken the production of a crucial protein called IL-22, which helps fight this inflammation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMice were used in this research, which also reveals something that excited researchers: while saturated fats suppress IL-22 production, unsaturated fats, found in nuts and avocados, actually boost the protein\u2019s production.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ho says this provides immense hope for people living with chronic inflammatory diseases like IBD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that certain types of foods, a high-quality diet, for example, reaching fruit, vegetables, fish, and other fibre sources is considered to be a protective factor when it comes to inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNatasha has found eating well has had a huge impact on her symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know that if I'm living off fast food for a week as opposed to making healthy at home meals, my Crohn's is a lot better in that latter thing because my body's healthier and it's ensuring that my body's not flaring up with what I'm eating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile IBD is a chronic condition with no cure, it can be managed with treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly diagnosis is important, with symptoms including abnormal bowel movements and the presence of mucus or blood in stools, as well as abdominal discomfort, bloating and flatulence.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeanne Raven, CEO of Crohns and Colitis Australia, says greater awareness around I-B-D will also help when it comes to diagnosis, support and treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it's below the belly button, people don't necessarily talk about it. So, a lot of people become quite isolated in trying to manage their conditions. So, we're trying to shatter the IBD silence through raising awareness of and encouraging people to have conversations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNatasha says while there is less stigma and embarrassment around I-B-D than ever before, more people need to talk about it.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia, one of the world\u2019s largest coffee producers, has just hosted a global event that\u2019s turning heads, and turning up the heat, in the specialty coffee world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the World of Coffee Jakarta 2025, the first time this prestigious international coffee showcase has been held in a coffee-producing country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for Indonesia, it\u2019s more than just an honour ... it\u2019s a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom cutting-edge brewing competitions to ethically sourced beans, thousands gathered in Jakarta for a full-bodied celebration of everything coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the heart of it is the Specialty Coffee Association, or SCA, which launched the World of Coffee expo back in 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, it finally made its way to the farms and forests where so much of the world\u2019s finest coffee begins.\n\n\n\n\n\nYannis Apostolopoulos, the CEO of the Specialty Coffee Association, says the aim is to reframe how we think about coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think what we're trying to do is to excite consumers in consuming coffee. Coffee is moving away from being a functional beverage to becoming more of an indulgement. And what we want to do is to get consumers through a journey that they find coffee exciting as food or wine, so that people can actually enjoy coffee and maybe understand the value that they bring to the value chain and to the people that are producing coffee all around the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s talking about a deeper experience, one where coffee sits alongside wine and fine cuisine, with respect for every hand along the supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those hands belongs to Mikael Jasin, the World Barista Champion in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s a familiar face here, brewing with the same meticulous care farmers use when harvesting cherries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least for me, it's making sure that the approach that I do when I make this coffee is the same standard at least to the approach that the farmers have done to their coffee, the roasters have done to that coffee, and then me as the barista at least maintain the same standard, if not better. So that the customer when they drink it, they can enjoy that coffee to the best potential of that coffee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it\u2019s about preserving the integrity of the bean, from farm to roast to cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sense of duty, he admits, becomes even more intense when he\u2019s making coffee for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCoffee, there's still so many people that are involved in the steps and it's very easy to mess it up. So, when I make coffee - and especially when I make coffee for people, when I make coffee for myself, I'm a bit more relaxed - but for people, I want make sure that I'm serving the best of that coffee .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it all begins with the farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the volcanic slopes of Bandung, West Java, coffee cherries ripen in the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is home to Java Halu Coffee, run by Rani Mayasari.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt her booth in Jakarta, she beams with pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taken 15 years to build her farm, empower women, and make it here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, she\u2019s sharing Indonesia\u2019s story with the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's proof that maybe our world is more better. It's our hope in the coffee industry, our hope, our economy, our politics more better in next year. It's like a medicine for us. It's like a painkiller for us, you know? Because a lot of effort that we already doing in 15 years. So it's like a good food, healthy food, or soulful food maybe for us. So our soul happy, our body happy, so we can make it in these three days.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says serving her first harvest to international buyers is more than a sale, it\u2019s a celebration of identity, resilience, and the soulful joy of good coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung coffee lovers, too, are finding inspiration here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them, 18-year-old Jamie Elijah Yauw.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s just graduated high school but already dreams of joining the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think every step of the way at the industry is amazing. It's beautiful, it's inspiring, and to be here, meeting people who\u2019ve worked with farmers, meeting people who make the tools we use every day, meeting people explain how they roast their coffee and seeing the effort that people put, or see how much they love, how much they put their whole life into coffee, is so inspiring. Where for me to see people like that, it's just making me awestruck, really.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, the grand finale, the World Brewers Cup 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter three days of intense competition, China\u2019s George Jinyang Peng emerged as this year\u2019s champion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel so very excited and very happy, and maybe a little bit shocked.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over 50 participants and more on the horizon, the competition mirrors the fast-growing specialty coffee market, especially in producing nations like Indonesia, Brazil, and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the global coffee industry now generates more than $200 billion in annual revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024 alone, the price of Arabica surged by 58 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd with growing interest in transparency, sustainability, and quality, events like World of Coffee Jakarta are redefining the bean, not just as a drink, but as a story.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Indonesia, that story is just beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it smells like a fresh brew of national pride and global respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points A committee will oversee an 'inquiry into the recruitment methods and impacts of cults and organised fringe groups'.\n\nIt will look at groups using techniques that harm people emotionally, psychologically, financially, or physically.\n\nSome groups are using coercion techniques and the inquiry will consider whether this should be criminalised.\n\nTore Klevjer has seen the destruction done to the lives of many people who have become part of a cult in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president of Cult Information and Family Support Australia is hoping an inquiry into the tactics of cults and fringe groups will bring awareness of the harm such groups are causing and drive change to hold the groups accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Victorian parliamentary committee will oversee the inquiry into the recruitment methods and impacts of cults and organised fringe groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation, which is currently taking public submissions, may have a focus on activities in Victoria, but Klevjer said many of the groups that are likely to be analysed operate in much the same way across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElla George, the chair of the Legislative Assembly Legal and Social Issues Committee overseeing the inquiry, said it was \"not about judging or questioning anyone\u2019s beliefs, religious or otherwise\".\n\n\n\nCult Information and Family Support Australia president Tore Klevjer wants those impacted by the practices of cults in Australia to have recourse for the treatment they are subjected to. Source: Supplied The inquiry's guidance notes state its focus will be \"those groups that use techniques that can harm individuals emotionally, psychologically, financially, or even physically\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt aims \"to understand whether current laws are strong enough to deal with groups that use manipulation or control in ways that can seriously hurt people\".\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge said in her statement announcing the inquiry that \"recent events in the state\" had led to the probe, but did not detail which groups such events involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of Australian news outlets have reported accounts from former members of groups such as Shincheonji and Geelong Revival Centre, who have spoken about alleged coercion and the negative impacts their involvement with those groups had on their lives.\n\n\n\nThe harm caused by cults\n\nWhile Australians have freedom of religion, the guidance notes for the inquiry state: \"Religious freedom does not grant a licence to cause harm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no legal definition of a cult in Australia, but for the purpose of the inquiry, the reference is to groups that use manipulative or controlling tactics to dominate members.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge said some groups use \"practices that can cause significant emotional, psychological, financial, or even physical harm\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are legitimate concerns about the techniques being used by certain groups to attract and retain members, and whether they amount to coercion that should be criminalised,\" George said.\n\n\n\nKlevjer said he saw some of the biggest impacts on young people, who some of these groups often tried to sign up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It pulls their families apart, a lot of times they quit their education, their uni degree, and when they finally leave, quite often, after three or four years, they've got to start again so they're left behind from their peers, their study and their opportunities,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It disrupts their families as well, because they're taught to lie to their parents and to their family. \"It's very disruptive, and it breaks down a lot of trust.\"\n\n\n\nStatus of such groups\n\nKlevjer said many of the groups that may be considered cults or fringe groups are registered charities in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nKlevjer said he would like to see all tax-exempt charities be compelled to make their financial reports publicly available in order for them to demonstrate that funds were being used for \"genuine\" charitable purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said if the groups themselves were not registered charities: \"A lot of cults will have a front organisation as charitable status, and that's where it gets a little bit tricky, too, because a lot of these groups do have different names in different front organisations.\"\n\n\n\nRecruitment and control\n\nThe use of front groups to mask a group's true nature is listed in the inquiry's guidance notes as one of the tactics used by cults and front groups to recruit new members that may be looked at.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther possible tactics that could be considered include 'love bombing', where new recruits are overwhelmed with affection, praise, and attention to create emotional bonds as well as isolating recruits from outside influences and overwhelming them with group activities or doctrine and framing dissenters as toxic or unenlightened.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Ruth was born into a cult. She reveals the sly tactics used to lure in victims\n\nOther possible methods used by cults to control members have also been outlined for those considering making a submission.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include the use of controlling leadership that demands obedience, loss of personal autonomy as members are encouraged to focus fully on a group\u2019s mission, secrecy, deception and emotional and psychological manipulation.\n\n\n\nAddressing the issues around cults\n\nKlevjer said people who feel they have been poorly treated by such groups usually have little recourse and he wanted to see this changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe proposes that religious or ideological organisations should have to publish a statement of faith or belief practices to clearly outline their core doctrines, expectations of members, and any practices that may significantly impact individual autonomy or well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If an organisation is found to have withheld or misrepresented its beliefs in a way that leads to harm, individuals should have legal recourse, similar to protections against deceptive conduct under consumer protection laws,\" Klevjer said.\n\n\n\nIt's understood some groups that are considered cults use the pretext of bible study as a way to bring in new members but fail to fully explain who the group is and what being part of the group will involve. Source: Getty / fstop123 He said often when cults were accused of certain behaviour such as coercion, misrepresentation, or what he referred to as \"personal abuses\" the \"the cult can just turn around, as they often do, and Just say, well, it wasn't our teaching, that was just the leadership you were under at the time, and then just hang someone else out to dry\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also wants to see coercive control laws extended beyond domestic relationships to include cases involving such groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rationalist Society of Australia (RSA) wrote to all states and territories in December, urging them to address coercive control in cults.\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA executive director Si Gladman sent a letter to attorneys-general that said religious cults posed a great danger to the fundamental rights and freedoms of many Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nGladman wrote that \"numerous survivors of cult groups\", including the Geelong Revival Centre and Shincheonji Church, were \"bravely speaking out about the coercive practices and harm they have been subjected to\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These practices are at odds with fundamental human rights norms. Yet, they are all commonplace in certain sections of Australian society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Clearly, religious cults pose a great danger to the fundamental rights and freedoms of many Australians.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE My daughter has joined a cult. I have no idea how to get her out\n\nGeorge acknowledged upon the announcement of the inquiry that coercive control laws were to be considered as part of the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are legitimate concerns about the techniques being used by certain groups to attract and retain members, and whether they amount to coercion that should be criminalised.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic submissions will be taken until the end of July, and members of the public can also provide input through an online, anonymous questionnaire, with public hearings expected to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee is expected to provide its report by the end of September 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nShincheonji's Melbourne chapter and the Geelong Revival Church have been contacted for comment.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians looking for work are increasingly being targeted by scammers posing as legitimate employers \u2014 and losing money in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictims are tricked into applying for what appears to be a real job by scammers impersonating high-profile companies and recruitment agencies, who then steal their money.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob and employment scams are one of the the fastest-growing scam types in Australia, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) tracking a 150 per cent increase in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what these scams look like \u2014 and how to avoid them.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Job ad scams rising & Donald Trump's market influence SBS News 23/05/2025 12:55 Play\n\nWhat is a job scam?\n\nJob scams come in various forms but ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe told SBS that the greatest financial losses were being caused by those in which \"scammers go to quite elaborate lengths to create the illusion of a real job\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A person might apply for a job that involves online task-based employment. They might have what seems to be a group chat with other employees. They'll go through a process that looks like a recruitment process,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nScammers then ask for upfront payments to \"unlock\" the income they've promised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is all an elaborate ruse to encourage a person to make small [payments] initially, then big payments to unlock alleged earnings that they've made through performing these tasks.\"\n\n\n\n\"But in fact, it's all an elaborate ruse to obtain those payments, and it's only when a person stops paying that it becomes clear it was all a scam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to ScamWatch, the scammers often impersonate well-known recruitment agencies or pretend to be hiring on behalf of high-profile companies and online shopping platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also two other types of job scams to watch for:\n\n\n\nBank mule scams : Where victims are unknowingly used to move money through their bank accounts.\n\nFake qualifications: Where victims are encouraged to make payments to receive certifications for jobs that don't exist.\n\n\"There's no job, there's no checks being done. It's just another way, unfortunately, of obtaining money from scam victims,\" Lowe said.\n\n\n\nWhy experts are concerned\n\nJob and employment scams are not only growing rapidly \u2014 they also disproportionately target vulnerable job seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The other dimension of a jobs and employment scam that really makes it such an important candidate for action is, of course, people who are looking for work in difficult economic circumstances are already vulnerable,\" Lowe said.\n\n\n\n\"We see some particularly vulnerable members of our community being disproportionately impacted by this scam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It might be international students, people on low incomes, people from a culturally and linguistically diverse background, and people that might otherwise find it difficult to secure employment.\"\n\n\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nThe first step is knowing the warning signs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The key one is if you are being asked to pay money to make money, that is a really big red flag that what you're dealing with may, in fact, be a scam,\" Lowe said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also advises being suspicious of unsolicited contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That could be a text message. It could be a WhatsApp message or someone reaching out unexpectedly,\" Lowe said. \"That's a sign to be on your guard about the message that you've received.\"\n\n\n\nOther red flags include:\n\n\n\nOffers that promise \"substantial returns for relatively simple work\".\n\nMessages claiming to be from \"high-profile, well-known recruitment businesses\".\n\n\"If you think it could be a legitimate offer or opportunity, the very best thing to do is to independently check.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't click on links, don't call the numbers that might be in that message. Go to that company's website or separately find their phone number and make sure that what you are dealing with is legit\".\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coffee\u2019s steaming hot at the Happy Frog caf\u00e9 in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cup is one of six billion consumed nationwide each year, according to Agrifutures Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most, this one is made with locally grown beans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cafe\u2019s owner is Kim Towner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's been a real passion of mine since I first went into the cafe business, was to buy as close to home as I could. And it's just a win-win all round for everybody, I think. It's beautiful coffee. We get to know the people that have grown it. And that has been probably my biggest, favouritest thing. But of course it's got the low food miles, so it's good for the environment. I know its story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia grows less than half a percent of all the coffee we drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducing more sounds a great idea, but is it worth the effort?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Southern Cross University in Lismore, Professor Tobias Kretzschmar is finding out by trialling new trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we're part of a larger project with the World Coffee Research. They're interested in trialling 20 to 30 coffee varieties all around the globe. So we piggybacked on that global project to be able to trial those varieties in Australia. And our aim for Australia is to find new varieties that are better suited for this environment and better suited for the mechanized conditions of coffee farming in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Australian coffee grows in Queensland or northern New South Wales where farmers face climate challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey put their money on a variety that's much too vigorous for this environment. So we're looking at something that's semi-dwarf, easy to be machine harvested. So the next stage would be to take the two to three varieties that we're thinking will out-compete the current varieties and trial them at scale.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, coffee exports spiked recently after a run of falls and prices remained volatile due to trade tensions and fears of economic slowdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Joules is a research analyst with Rabobank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn April we did see Arabica prices ease slightly but nonetheless on a year-on-year basis we're still around 100% higher.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that means ever-rising prices at the coffee shop. So could Australia ever compete with Brazil or Colombia?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Tobias Kretzschmar again:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re covering around half a percent of what the Australian consumer is drinking at the moment. If we can double that, that'd be fantastic. If we can triple or quadruple that, we'd be punching above our weight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also about finding a coffee style with broad appeal. For clues, scientists have turned to a unique taste wheel which helps analyse the makeup of a particular taste.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ben Liu is behind the taste wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst we actually have this coffee tasting by different professionals. They work in the coffee industry for decades. And then we actually collect a different type of data from them and from description from them. And then we summarise them with also some of the score for the taste and the flavour of the coffee. And then we bring the exact same sample they taste back to our lab and do carry out analysis. And so we can associate the data from the chemistry also to the taste and the smell of the coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taste wheel doesn\u2019t just identify the flavour of the coffee, but its character as well and uses words as diverse as \u2018yoghurty\u2019, \u2018apple like\u2019 and even dirty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c So this coffee character wheel basically helps the panel members to actually get an idea of what they think, what could be used to describe the taste, the flavour, or a different mouthfeel they actually feel. But saying that there are some bad words there because there are also some bad taste coffee there. Unfortunately, during our coffee research, (we not just taste the best coffee, we also taste bad coffee as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Liu says Australian grown coffee does have some common characteristics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe collect 100 single-origin coffee around Australian farmers. And when we run this tasting panel, the words that keep coming out for Australian coffee are they are sweet and they are fruity and they are nutty and roasty. So that's the thing that's coming up the most for Australian coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Kim Towner, the decision to use locally grown coffee was simple.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "When a woman knocked on Geoffrey Horlock's door and told him that her baby brother had been buried in the same grave plot as his own brother, he was more than a little surprised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was not sure what to say at first,\" Horlock says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis brother Andrew had been stillborn in 1960. Horlock was around nine at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe recalls his mother telling him about how his brother was taken out of the delivery room in a white sheet and buried in the local cemetery while she was still recovering in hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how infant loss was often dealt with in the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\"Mum never got over it,\" Horlock says.\n\n\n\nRight until the day she died, she always used to say: 'I wonder which side of the family he looked like.'\n\nThe family was issued a birth certificate and told about the burial site.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this was not always the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Harding family, whose baby died less than three weeks after the Horlocks' in the same regional Western Australian town, no birth certificate was issued.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike baby Horlock, baby Harding was live-born but arrived prematurely and tragically did not survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnbeknownst to both families, he was buried alongside baby Horlock in the lower part of his grave plot in August 1960.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until baby Harding\u2019s older sister, Susan Mead, showed up on Geoffrey Horlock's doorstep some 65 years later that the connection was finally made.\n\n\n\nSusan Mead tracked down one of the siblings of Andrew Horlock, whose grave her baby brother shares, to another small town near where she lives. Source: Supplied She had come to ask whether she could place a marking on the grave to recognise her brother.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorlock says once the initial shock passed, he realised there was only one answer.\n\n\n\nFinding Baby Harding\n\nMead lives on a property in the south-west of WA, about 65km east of the small town of Bridgetown where her mother gave birth to baby Harding. Mead and her siblings had spent decades hoping to find their baby brother\u2019s resting place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut without formal documentation, such as a birth or death certificate, their efforts to find him were continually stymied.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, in March, they reached a turning point.\n\n\n\n\n\nMead's sister-in-law spotted a Facebook post from the Shire of Bridgetown-Greenbushes, about records for the nearby Bridgetown Cemetery having been uploaded to its website.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking over the shire's list of people buried there, Mead came across a mention of a 'Baby Harding'. That name had not been included in previous searchable listings for the cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt identified the exact location of the grave, too, but when family members went to visit, they found a gravestone for baby Horlock instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfused, the family contacted Bridgetown-Greenbushes Shire, which manages the cemetery. They confirmed that baby Harding is also buried in the plot, which, according to records, had been divided in two \u2014 a practice that the local government has since ceased.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a spokesperson for the shire acknowledged the challenges with historical burial records for stillbirths and neonatal deaths, noting it is \"currently completing an audit and correlation of hardcopy documents, current headstones and electronic records\" to ensure it has a fully digitised and accurate record of all listings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson says the shire is aware of one other case in which two unrelated babies were buried in the same plot, dating back to 1954. In that case, two stillborn babies were buried in the same plot eight weeks apart, despite records showing it was not listed as a 'half plot'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Shire is committed to ensuring this information is researched and updated so that descendant family members can search for and locate loved ones,\" the spokesperson says.\n\n\n\nA taboo subject\n\nMany families who lost babies as a result of stillbirth or neonatal death before the 1980s in Australia remain in the dark about their loved one\u2019s final resting place.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan Noonan is a volunteer co-leader with a group set up by Red Nose Australia, which seeks to prevent the sudden and unexpected death of babies and young children and gives bereavement support for those affected by death of a baby or young child. Its 'Older Loss Group' supports mothers who are still processing the grief of stillbirth years after losing a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key aims of the group, which is based in Victoria, is to help families in tracking down burial sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan says many families search for the final resting place of their stillborn family members in the hope of finding some peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 78-year-old became part of the Older Loss Group about 30 years ago, having lost two infant daughters of her own in the 1970s.\n\n\n\nJoan Noonan, (pictured far right) has helped many women, including Lee (second from left), to find their baby's burial site, years after their loss. Source: Supplied / Red Nose Australia \"In most cases, you weren't given a chance to have a funeral,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The hospital staff would say they were 'looking after these babies', and the hospital would arrange burial and families weren't even told where they were buried.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan says at that time, it was not the \"done thing\" to question the process. Stillbirth was treated as taboo.\n\n\n\nNobody talked about the death of a baby.\n\n\"In the majority of cases, they were buried in communal graves, they often waited for about 10 babies at a time and there's some places in Melbourne where there's hundreds of babies buried in mass graves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan\u2019s volunteer co-lead, Fotini Koklas, says given most babies they have located via the Older Loss Group are in mass graves, the situation involving the Hardings and the Horlocks appears to be \"extremely rare\".\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas has come across one similar case in which a baby was buried in a grave with an unrelated adult, with no clear explanation as to why this happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's possible that it was a space issue, or perhaps the cemetery simply didn't know where to place the baby,\" she says.\n\n\n\nCo-leader of Red Nose Australia's Older Loss Group, Fotini Koklas, says while the process of finding a baby\u2019s final resting place should be a healing journey, unnecessary obstacles can make it more emotionally draining than it should be. Source: Supplied\n\nIn search of lost babies\n\nUntil this year, baby Harding's name would have only have been traceable via handwritten records stored in a very specific location by the Bridgetown-Greenbushes shire.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas says because of state-based variations in laws, record systems and how stillbirths are handled, it can be incredibly challenging for families to track down accurate information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every cemetery is different, and the level of detail they have in their historical records varies greatly,\" she says.\n\n\n\nHistorically, different stakeholders that may have details that could help families were very siloed from one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's often a breakdown in communication between cemeteries, stonemasons, and families, in some cases, critical details aren't shared \u2014 either because of incomplete records or administrative oversights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas says the passage of time complicates the process further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the decades, cemetery management has often changed hands, record-keeping systems have evolved, and unfortunately, some older records have been lost, damaged, or simply never kept in the first place \u2014 especially for babies born before the 1980s.\"\n\n\n\nInconsistent records\n\nInaccurate and inconsistent historical records present an added hurdle for those searching for answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas explains that naming stillborn babies was subject to variation: they could be recorded with their mother's maiden name or married name, or referred to as names such as: \"Baby Smith,\" \"Stillborn Smith,\" or \"Baby of Kate Smith\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO \"I found it to be really lonely': Data show parents often silent after miscarriage or stillbirth SBS News 13/10/2023 04:38 Play\n\n\"While families can sometimes search online for burial records, the transition from handwritten paper records to digital systems has introduced a number of issues,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dates are often misrecorded due to difficulties in reading old handwriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In one case, a baby who passed away in April 1966 was entered into the system as April 1968.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan says despite such challenges, it's often still possible to piece information together by cross-referencing available records, contacting multiple sources and a bit of compassionate persistence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've developed some records now that show in Victoria what hospitals used what undertakers and then what cemeteries they used and things like that,\" she says.\n\n\n\n'Something to be forgotten'\n\nIn years gone by, a birth may not have even been considered a birth if the baby was stillborn, so no birth or death certificate was issued. This also meant that protocols around burial fell outside of legal requirements.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The statutory instruments and registration practices related to births and perinatal deaths \u2014 which include stillbirths and neonatal deaths \u2014 have varied between Australian states and territories over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in Queensland and Victoria, legislation around the registration of stillbirths came into place in 1989, while in NSW it was a 1995 Act that recognised stillbirth as a birth and therefore required formal registration.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor Fran Boyle from the University of Queensland's Institute for Social Science Research and Stillbirth Centre of Research Excellence says it was not until the mid-1980s that social attitudes toward perinatal deaths began to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was largely due to the voices of bereaved parents,\" she explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nParent advocacy groups under the banner of Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (SANDS) \u2014 now part of Red Nose \u2014 were formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of their many important achievements was the successful campaign for government to recognise stillborn babies through birth and death certificates,\" Boyle says.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, across Australia, a stillborn baby at 20 weeks gestation or more is required to be registered, in most states and territories that will warrant a birth certificate, noting stillbirth.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Boyle says burial practices tend to reflect the \"prevailing social norm\" of the time, and before the 80s \"the loss of a baby was something to be forgotten\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It was] not something to be discussed or memorialised.\"\n\n\n\nLiving with the trauma\n\nBoyle says such sentiment informed the practice of withholding stillborn babies from their mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany were never given the chance to look at or hold their children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The widely held view was that parents needed to be protected, that seeing their baby, having contact with their baby, creating memories of any kind would be harmful, and intensify and prolong their grief,\" Boyle says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorlock still remembers his mother returning from hospital after giving birth without his baby brother.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Horlock's recalls how his mother was deeply impacted by not only the loss of her baby, but by the process around the loss in not being able to hold her baby or say goodbye. Source: Supplied He says she spent days sitting by the wood fire stove in their kitchen, just staring at the fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mum was distressed about it and it troubled her her whole life,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch has changed since laws recognising the births of stillborn babies were strengthened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national Care Around Stillbirth and Neonatal Death guidelines, updated in 2024, cover best practice for stillbirth and recommend offering all parents the opportunity to see and hold their baby immediately after birth and allowing them to interact with their baby through activities such as bathing and dressing them.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas has seen the benefit of these changes firsthand. As well as being involved in helping to find baby graves, she is a bereaved mum. Her two baby boys died in 2011 and 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am so grateful I got to hold my babies, name them and make funeral arrangements for them,\" she says.\n\n\n\nA healing process\n\nFor those who lost children in decades gone by, the hope of finding their graves remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas says every family she has supported to locate their baby has shared a similar feeling: a deep sense of peace and closure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finding a baby's final resting place is one of the most healing and powerful experiences \u2026 it's something that goes beyond words, like a heavy weight being lifted.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't mean they've 'moved on' \u2014 because grief doesn't work that way \u2014 but they feel like they can now live again, just a little bit lighter.\n\nSimilarly, Noonan attests to the importance of finding burial sites. She says while the Older Loss Group has helped to locate hundreds of babies, there are still so many more Australian families out there wishing they knew where their babies were.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe encourages anyone needing help in their search to reach out, saying: \"it's never too late\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia is running out of space to bury people.

        "text": "Elara was \"caught off guard\" and \"hurt\" when she was denied entry to the women-only gym Fernwood Fitness for not being a \"biologically born female\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA Melbourne-based transgender woman, Elara was drawn to a club owned by the national gym network because her wife and friends had recommended it. She also generally found women's spaces to be more inclusive and accepting of trans women than mixed spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a lot easier for trans women in women's spaces, fundamentally,\" Elara told SBS News. \"My experience has been that women's spaces are more accepting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when she enquired via text message about whether she would be permitted access as a transgender woman, she was told by a manager at Fernwood Fitness in Melbourne that \"the Fernwood company policy is not inclusive of transgender women\".\n\n\n\nElara received a message from a manager at a Melbourne Fernwood Fitness gym, who said only \"biologically born females who identify as female\" could join the women-only gym. Source: Supplied Fernwood Fitness is one of the leading women-only gym chains in Australia. They have over 70 clubs across Australia and over 90,000 members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood offers membership only to biologically born females who identify as female,\" the message, which has been verified by SBS News, read.\n\n\n\n\n\nElara later shared her experience on Reddit, prompting an outpouring of support \u2014 and several anonymous accounts from other transgender women who claim they too were turned away by Fernwood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I found this out last year when I tried to join,\" one user wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the text exchange, Elara said she was phoned by the national CEO of Fernwood, which the company has confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was just flabbergasted,\" Elara said. \"My experience of being a trans woman so far in Melbourne has been that the level of vitriol and pushback and rejection that we expect from watching the news isn't there.\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess I got a little bit forgetful that the world is still like that,\" Elara said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really took me aback and made me think about all the rights that we think we have here ... to just find out that some people can be like, 'nah,' that company policy is to just say no.\"\n\n\n\nIs it legal to exclude trans women from women-only spaces?\n\nThe federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 makes it unlawful to treat someone unfairly because of their sex, sexual orientation, intersex status, or gender identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), gender identity includes \"the way people express or present their gender and recognises that a person's gender may be an identity other than male or female\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Terms commonly used to describe a person's gender identity include trans, transgender and gender diverse,' AHRC's website reads. \"It does not matter what sex a person was assigned at birth or whether the person has undergone any medical intervention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Paula Gerber, an expert in human rights law at Monash University, said while women-only gyms are lawful both in Victoria and nationwide, excluding trans women is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood is perfectly entitled to have a women-only gym,\" she told SBS News. \"But women include trans women in Australia.\"\n\n\n\nPaula Gerber, a professor in human rights law at Monash University, said that while women-only gyms are lawful in Australia, excluding trans women from them is not. Source: Getty / Kazuma Seki \"It is not lawful to have a women's only venue and say that's only for people who were described as female on their birth certificate,\" Gerber said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The law says trans women are women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery Australian state and territory has its own anti-discrimination laws that operate alongside federal legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, where Elara lives, it's against the law to discriminate against people based on gender identity \"that may or may not be the same as the sex you were designated with at birth\", under the Equal Opportunity Act 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut organisations are permitted to apply for temporary exemptions to the Act, which allows discrimination of any protected characteristics \u2014 which include gender identity \u2014 to be lawful, provided it would help the Act's goal of promoting equal opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, some clubs may provide benefits for members of particular age groups or single sex,\" according to the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission's website.\n\n\n\nFernwood is perfectly entitled to have a women-only gym. But women include trans women in Australia. Paula Gerber, human rights law expert\n\nIn 2021, Fernwood sought an exemption from Queensland's Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, concerned about members' religious freedom and psychological safety, as well as fears that their women-only fitness model \"could give rise to a complaint by a man that Fernwood is directly discriminating against men\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commission granted the exemption for five years, saying female-only fitness clubs were a \"welfare\" and \"equal opportunity\" measure.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear on what grounds Fernwood Fitness is excluding trans women, but at present, their publicly available 11-page membership terms and conditions do not reference sex or gender eligibility criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, they operate under a franchise model, making it difficult to ascertain how widespread their policy is.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted Fernwood for clarification on this issue but has not received a response.\n\n\n\nFernwood defends policy as necessary for 'emotional and physical safety'\n\nIn a statement provided to both SBS News and Elara, Fernwood Fitness said they had \"a responsibility to consider the needs of its broader member community\", adding that female-only spaces \"based on sex\" were necessary to protect members' \"emotional and physical safety\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood Fitness proactively reached out to Elara to acknowledge her as an individual and to talk about her experience,\" the statement provided to SBS News read.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Government announces federal review into gender-affirming healthcare for young people\n\n\"This outreach was made with genuine care, recognising the personal nature of her enquiry,\" the statement read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood appreciates the courage it can take to enquire about a membership as a transgender woman and acknowledges that the experience may have been hurtful or disappointing. Fernwood Fitness extends its sincere empathy in response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the same time, Fernwood Fitness has a responsibility to consider the needs of its broader member community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A significant number of Fernwood Fitness members come from backgrounds where experiences of domestic violence, sexual assault, cultural beliefs, or religious practices necessitate access to female-only spaces based on sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many of these women, such spaces are not a preference but a requirement for their emotional and physical safety and for accessing the health and fitness services they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a reflection on personal identity, but rather a commitment to maintaining the integrity of a space that many women rely on. Fernwood is currently reviewing all relevant legal requirements.\"\n\n\n\n'Trans women are women', legal expert says\n\nGerber said these arguments may not hold legal weight when used to exclude trans women.\n\n\n\nPaula Gerber, a professor of human rights law at Monash University, said Fernwood's argument may not hold legal weight when used to exclude transgender women. Credit: Paula Gerber \"Women include trans women in Australia \u2014 that's very clear from the decision in Tickle and Giggle and the Lesbian Action Group,\" Gerber said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTickle v Giggle was a case centred on transgender woman Roxanne Tickle being denied access to a women-only app, Giggle for Girls. The Federal Court found the app had indirectly discriminated against Tickle based on her gender identity, a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Court ruled: \"The acceptance that Ms Tickle is correctly described as a woman, reinforcing her gender identity status for the purposes of this proceeding, and therefore for the purposes of bringing her present claim of gender identity discrimination, is legally unimpeachable.\"\n\n\n\nSupporters of Roxanne Tickle hold a sign outside the Federal Court of Australia in April 2024. TERF stands for 'trans-exclusionary radical feminist'. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi In 2023, the Lesbian Action Group applied for an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act to host regular publicly advertised 'lesbians born female only events'.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerber, who acted as an expert witness for the AHRC, said the group argued they needed to be protected from, as she puts it, \"men pretending to be women\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commission rejected the application for exemption, saying: \"The commission is not persuaded it is appropriate and reasonable to make distinctions between women based on their biological sex at birth or transgender experience, and to exclude transgender lesbians, from a community event of this kind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGerber said: \"The response from the Human Rights Commission and the [Federal Court] tribunal is that the threat is not from trans women. The threat is from men.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said these cases may influence what the law says about Fernwood's exclusion of trans women: \"That's contrary to what the law says \u2014 the law says trans women are women.\"\n\n\n\nTrans safety in women's spaces\n\nElara said one of the most upsetting parts of the conversation was the implication that she, as a trans woman, might pose a safety threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who are saying that we need to exclude trans women for safety aren't really talking about women's safety. They're talking about an ideological position about whether or not trans women are women,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson from Zoe Belle Gender Collective (ZBGC), a trans and gender diverse-led advocacy organisation based in Victoria, told SBS News: \"Trans women and cis women have much in common, including being disproportionately impacted by men's violence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The same drivers of violence that impact cis women equally drive violence against trans women, including rigid gender norms and dominant forms of masculinity,\" a ZBGC spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nA La Trobe University study found transgender and non-binary people were more likely to experience high psychological distress than cisgender people. Source: SBS News Trans women, trans men and non-binary people were also more likely to experience very high psychological distress compared to cisgender women and men, according to La Trobe University's Private Lives 3 report from 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 survey of 3,099 transgender people conducted by the Trans Justice Project and the Victorian Pride Lobby found one in two participants had experienced anti-trans hate. One in ten had experienced anti-trans violence, and nine in ten had witnessed online anti-trans abuse.\n\n\n\nTrans women and cis women have much in common, including being disproportionately impacted by men's violence. Spokesperson, Zoe Belle Gender Collective\n\nInternationally, a 2021 study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law found transgender people were over four times more likely to experience violent victimisation than cisgender people, or those whose gender identity corresponds with the sex assigned to them at birth. This included higher rates of violence than both cisgender men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, analysis by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found 97 per cent of all sexual assault offenders were male, according to data recorded by police agencies in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When incidents of trans exclusion occur, it can reinforce the ideas that we don't belong, that we are not worthy of support, or that the violence perpetuated against our community does not matter,\" a ZBGC spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These incidents may also contribute to some trans women feeling unsafe to access the services our society has created to support victims of violence.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'A really dark place': Chantel is among LGBTIQ+ users fearful of Meta's changes SBS News 22/02/2025 06:45 Play\n\n'Trans women are not a threat'\n\nGerber also warned policies excluding trans women can lead to harmful \"policing\" of women's bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The privacy that's being violated is trans women having to prove their gender,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing situations where complete strangers feel entitled to challenge someone's right to be in a space, based solely on how they look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is what we need to avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If somebody says they\u2019re a woman, then they are a woman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also questioned traditional narratives that trans women were threats to women's safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Men pretending to be women so that they can get into a women's only gym and assault someone \u2026 that's not what trans women are doing,\" Gerber said. \"Trans women are just trying to be themselves and live their authentic life. They're not a threat.\"\n\n\n\n'We thought we were better protected'\n\nGerber said while Australia has some of the strongest legal protections for trans rights in the world, enforcing these laws can involve making an individual complaint to your state's commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes a huge toll to take on a big company like Fernwood,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But that's the only way the law gets enforced in these situations where there are breaches of the anti-discrimination provisions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Elara, the experience has left her feeling disillusioned with the protections she thought were in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I did think we were better protected in Australia \u2026 we thought our legal protections were stronger than apparently they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels strange when the discrimination paraded in the news contaminates my own life so directly.

        "text": "The Melbourne woman has quickly made thousands from recycling and is encouraging others to do the same.\n\nA self-proclaimed \"binfluencer\" who encourages Aussies to make money from collecting cans and bottles says she's made $15,000 fairly easily as \"trash is everywhere\".\n\nSayo Leahy, 39, told Yahoo News the 10c per item offered at her local container collection centre in Melbourne quickly adds up. She says she can collect hundreds of cans in one night, jokingly calling herself an \"OnlyCans\" enthusiast.\n\n\"There's always cans on the side of the road, wherever you go there's always trash,\" she said, explaining she's been collecting cans and bottles since Victoria introduced its container deposit scheme in November, 2023.\n\n\"I calculated I've made about $15k, but obviously there's some costs involved, like fuel and wear and tear of the ute.\" Sometimes Sayo collects cans and bottles during committed evenings when she heads to the suburbs the night before bin day, or simply when she's out for a walk and spots discarded trash on the street.\n\nBinfluencer encourages other Aussies to recycle\n\nSayo has not only been able to earn extra cash to alleviate her own financial pressures, but she's also been able to make donations to charities. She encourages others to get involved, saying people don't need to go out of their way to make the scheme work for them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"People don't realise 10 cents can really add up and help, especially since you can just put your can next to your bin and then donate them,\" she said. \"I think it's amazing that we've finally established it in Victoria. It's been a long time coming.\"\n\nVictoria recently introduced a state-wide incentive to encourage people to use the scheme, with five $10,000 cash prizes up for grabs in the 'Win a million cents' competition if they return at least 50 eligible containers in a single donation before June 15. Sayo attended the launch party on her birthday at the start of the month.\n\nSayo is encouraging Aussies to get involved in their state's return and earn schemes. Source: VicReturn\n\nNew recycling schemes to get Aussies involved\n\nThe chance to win $10,000 is one way that authorities are encouraging Aussies to do their bit to contribute to the country's recycling efforts, with every state and territory now having their own container deposit scheme.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSchools are also jumping on board the incentive with many competitions playing out among students to encourage recycling. The nationwide program Mobile Muster incentivises students to recycle their old phones, chargers and other electronic accessories, while another scheme called TerraCycle makes it easier to recycle often hard-to-recycle items such as empty beauty products and plastic packaging.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "A kangaroo stands over another while it lies dying on a Victorian golf course. Source: Facebook/Vets For Compassion\n\nThe photo of an injured kangaroo lying on the ground dying has revealed the \"strong familial bonds\" that exist among the country's most iconic animals, with many members of the mob standing over the female roo as she took her final breath.\n\nA wildlife rescuer was called to a Victorian golf course at the start of the month after a golf ball hit the kangaroo on the head, leaving her on the ground \"shaking and convulsing\". When the rescuer arrived, two kangaroos were by her side, with one \"gently stroking her\" while a joey watched on metres away.\n\nPhotos taken of the moment highlight just how social the animals are, Helen Round from the East Trentham Wildlife Shelter told Yahoo News.\n\n\"Kangaroos don't mate for life but they're mates for life. Roos of similar personality will hang out together,\" she explained. \"They stay buddies for their whole lives. They will box each other, they will stay close to each other, feed together and raise joeys together.\"\n\nThe kangaroos continued to watch from afar when the rescuer saved the joey in the mother's pouch. Source: Facebook/Vets For Compassion\n\nJoeys are 'truly orphaned' when mother kangaroo dies\n\nKangaroo joeys are in their mother's pouch for up to a year and remain dependent on their maternal bond until they have fully matured.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"A joey is dependent on its mum psychologically, physically and emotionally until it's about two years old, so the joey is truly orphaned when it loses its mum,\" Helen said. \"Wildlife carers will do their best to keep it warm, feed it and mother it, but it's not the same as the bond they had with their mother.\"\n\nWhile an older joey watched on at the golf course, another was found inside the mother's pouch and the rescuer on the ground was able to save the youngster. As the joey was being tended for, the older joey and other roo returned again to be with the female.\n\n\"They have strong family bonds and complex family structures... it's truly incredible, and heartbreaking, to see,\" Helen said, adding that most wildlife workers will have witnessed loving bonds play out in front of them while responding to rescuers.\n\nThe image of a male kangaroo holding a dying female in his arms as she reaches for her joey was shared worldwide in 2016, with photographer Evan Switzer saying he'd \"never seen anything like this before\" and called kangaroo bonds \"a special thing\".\n\nKangaroos form strong bonds with one another.

        "text": "The case of a BYD Atto 3 left to be written off after \"minor\" damage highlights the challenges faced by the burgeoning EV industry.\n\nA new BYD Atto 3 was left in an Aussie scrapyard after a rear-end collision. Source: TikTok/Paul Maric\n\nA new Chinese electric vehicle sits under a tarp in a dusty Australian scrapyard. Damage to the car, although clearly visible, is relatively minor but the car has been written off.\n\nIt's a scenario that has plagued some early adopters of electric vehicles in the country as challenges persist in the fledgling repair network including a lack of qualified mechanics to work on the modern cars.\n\nThe BYD Atto 3 sitting under the tarp had been written off by the insurance company, ostensibly deemed too much trouble to fix.\n\n\"It had only done 300 kilometres. It was basically brand new and it was rear ended,\" car expert Paul Maric told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It had very minor rear-end damage. There was no damage to the battery and no further damage to the structure of the vehicle, and despite this, it appears the insurer wrote off the vehicle.\"\n\nIn the end, his electrician brother bought the car for about $2,500 to repurpose the battery as part of a solar storage system.\n\n\"If you look at what is happening in electric cars in general, the repair network doesn't have the skills required at scale, and definitely not on the scale that the government wants,\" Maric said.\n\n\"At the moment there's a lot of hoops for panel beaters to jump through to make it viable to repair an electric car, as a result of that you don't have many of them, and as a result of that it's very expensive to fix them.\"\n\nProposed law change could make EV repair issues worse\n\nNicolas Rio is the general manager at Right2Drive, a company that supplies motorists with a replacement vehicle when they're involved in an accident and it's not their fault. Because the business aims to provide a like for like replacement, it is having to stock more EVs in its fleet and is in constant contact with repairers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We work very closely with the repair network on understanding how those processes take place,\" he told Yahoo. \"We're starting to get more clarity on best practice, safe practice on electric vehicle repairs.\"\n\nWhile Teslas are the most common EVs in Australia, they can still face repair challenges. Source: Scientific Motor Body Works\n\nHe said while there is an increasing number of accredited EV repairers establishing themselves, any damage to the battery can still cause major challenges.\n\n\"When there's damage to the battery that can often be a very expensive repair which may exceed the value of the car,\" he said. \"That is a factor with electric vehicles.\n\n\"But generally speaking, the repair network that supports electric vehicles is strengthening, and definitely in metropolitan areas.\"\n\nHowever there are concerns in the industry that NSW could be about to introduce a major speed bump on the road to that improvement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is currently no coordinated national pathway for repairers to get officially certified to work on EVs. To help address that NSW Fair Trade is currently proposing changes to the state's Motor Dealers and Repairers Regulation including requiring mechanics to pass certain training courses before they're legally allowed to service and repair electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe changes would come into effect from July 1, and the industry says it could badly exacerbate shortages and ultimately lead to more damaged cars sitting idle in carparks and scrapyards waiting for repairers to jump through more regulatory hoops.\n\nThe CEO of the Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association (AAAA), Stuart Charity, warned this month that it would \"reduce access to essential repair services and increase costs for NSW motorists\".\n\n\"We agree that technicians working on high-voltage vehicles must be trained and competent \u2014 and that\u2019s already happening. But this proposal creates a legislative barrier that will drastically reduce the number of qualified service providers overnight,\" he said.\n\nMembers of the public have until the end of the month to provide feedback to the state government over the proposed changes.\n\nReal risks to working on EV batteries\n\nMaric said the changes could mean workers carrying out ordinary tasks like changing tyres would need to do the mandatory certification which \"just seems outrageous\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We sometimes underplay the amount of energy stored in one of these batteries and how much can be discharged if you mishandle a high voltage cable, or if you penetrate a battery,\" he said. The batteries can discharge enough energy to kill someone, he added.\n\n\"There are some real risks working on an electrified vehicle if you don't know what you're doing. So I agree we do need some [coordinated] licensing or training that people undertake, but there needs to be logical reasoning behind it.\"\n\nFor now, NSW Fair Trading says no final decisions have been made as it continues consultation with the industry.\n\nAccording to the AAAA, fewer than 10 per cent of NSW automotive technicians are estimated to have completed any formal EV training.\n\nMeanwhile the state government is aiming for more than half of new car sales to be EVs and hybrids by 2030.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
