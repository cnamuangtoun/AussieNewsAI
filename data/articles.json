        "text": "Tenacious D's Kyle Gass says he's \"hashed it out\" with Jack Black after his controversial comment about an assassination attempt on US President Donald Trump forced the cancellation of their Australian tour and threatened the band's future.\n\nIn a Rolling Stone interview that delved deep into the ferocious global backlash to his ill-judged quip onstage in Sydney last year , the guitarist joked the band's return would be \"bigger than Oasis\" and labelled an Australian senator a \"grandstander\" over calls for them to be deported.\n\nGass said he'd been having \"the greatest day ever\" when the duo behind the ARIA platinum-selling single Tribute took to the stage for their second show at the ICC Sydney on his birthday in July last year.\n\nTenacious D has postponed its concert in Newcastle tonight amid backlash against a joke made about the the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. (Facebook/Tenacious D)\n\nBut then he uttered the \"five one-syllable words that brought down the empire\".\n\nPresented with a cake and asked by Black to make a wish, Gass joked, \"Don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nIt was the same day Thomas Matthew Crooks left Trump bleeding from the ear with an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I'm human, I made a mistake. I was going for a joke. But timing is everything. If there was ever a 'too soon', it was this,\" Gass told the magazine.\n\nIt wasn't until the band were \"partying in my hotel room\" after the show that they started to see reports of his comments and Gass realised what was coming.\n\n\"It's overwhelming. It's like a tsunami of shit rolling over you. And then there's the regret. Like, 'Why would I do that?' I just didn't put it together. And the ramifications were so huge,\" he said.\n\nGass said there were even \"safety concerns\" and someone called his \"poor 95-year-old mum\".\n\nJack Black celebrates with Kyle Gass for his Tenacious D bandmate's birthday on July 14. (Facebook)\n\nBlack cancelled the tour and put \"all future creative plans \u2026 on hold\" as those involved went into damage control, sparking criticism from some corners that the movie star had thrown his decades-long friend under the bus to protect his Hollywood career.\n\nGass said it didn't really surprise him.\n\n\"I might have deserved it,\" he told Rolling Stone in an interview published on Wednesday.\n\n\"Or, he had to protect himself from his loose-cannon partner over here. I totally understood once safety concerns got in.\n\n\"I might have tried to finish the tour, and I think sometimes these things can blow over, but at the time, it's hard when the tsunami of shit is coming at you.\"\n\nGass said it was \"hard\" but he and Black later \"hashed it out\".\n\n\"Jack and I are all good. At the end of the day, we're friends. I've known Jack since he was 18, and it's been such a long marriage, really.\n\nTenacious D cancelled their Newcastle concert on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, before cancelling the whole Australian tour. (Tenacious D/Instagram)\n\n\"You go up and down, and we've always taken long breaks. He's had a lot of stuff to do, and I've got my other projects. So it doesn't even feel that different now.\"\n\nThe 65-year-old, whose Kyle Gass Band project has a new live album coming out, also had a parting shot for United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet who called on then-Immigration Minister Andrew Giles to deport the duo.\n\n\"It didn't take long to be like, 'Oh, this guy is such a grandstander',\" Gass told Rolling Stone .\n\n\"We're so used to it over here, where people take the opportunity to make a grand statement. And then the next day, my agent dropped me . And I was like, 'Well, gee, it would have been nice to at least talk to you or something'.\n\nGass had a parting shot for United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"But I think he wanted to get in the news cycle too \u2026 It did feel like an overreaction. But that speaks more to my relationship with my agent.\"\n\nBlack last August said the band would \"be back when it feels right\" and Gass was even more enthusiastic this week.",

        "text": "As 2025 ticked over into the Olympic year of 2026 in Indra Brown's household in Calgary, Canada, the popping of champagne corks had a slightly different feel to it.\n\n\"I got some practise over New Year's helping the parents pop from some bottles,\" Brown told ABC Sport with a laugh.\n\n\"Which was pretty fun.\"\n\nYou could be forgiven for being slightly concerned that a 15-year-old Melbourne schoolgirl was being co-opted into popping bottles of champagne.\n\nBut this was important, you see. Brown needed the practice.\n\nEarlier in December, at 15 years and 10 months old, Brown became the youngest Australian snow sport World Cup medallist in history, winning bronze in the Olympic halfpipe at the Secret Garden resort in Zhangjiakou, China.\n\nIndra Brown (right) stands on her first World Cup podium with stars Zoe Atkin (left) and Eileen Gu Ailing (centre). (Getty Images: Lintao Zhang)\n\nDespite it being her World Cup debut, Brown instantly showed she belonged on the world stage.\n\nLoading...\n\nHer dazzling performance put her on the podium alongside three-time Olympic medallist and defending Olympic champion Eileen Gu and defending world champion Zoe Atkin \u2014 illustrious company indeed.\n\nHer lack of World Cup experience did not show on the snow.\n\nBut when it came time to pop the corks on the celebratory champagne, Brown looked a little bit out of her depth for the first time.\n\nFortunately, Gu was on hand to help in what turned into one of the most innocent, heartwarming exchanges on the tour this season.\n\nEileen Gu helps Indra Brown with her champagne. (Supplied: FIS Park and Pipe)\n\nGu, the America-born Chinese superstar who became the first freestyle skier to win three medals at a single Winter Olympics in 2022, is one of the most recognisable athletes in the world, having appeared on the front cover of Elle, GQ and Vogue, amongst others.\n\nThe surrealism of having this global megastar help her out on a World Cup podium was not lost on Brown.\n\n\"It was an extremely special moment,\" she said.\n\n\"Just to stand there with an idol that I've looked up to for so long.\n\n\"That big-sister moment with her helping me out with the champagne, that made it even better.\"\n\nRecord-breaking start\n\nIndra Brown has finished third, second, first and fourth in her first four World Cup events. (Getty Images: Sean M. Haffey)\n\nWith such a brilliant start to her career, there's little surprise that with just five FIS World Cup starts under her belt, Brown has been named to the Australian Winter Olympic team to compete in the Milan Cortina games next month.\n\nAustralia names 53-strong Winter Olympic team From five teenagers making their Winter Olympics debut to five-time Olympian and gold medal hopeful Scott James, Australia has named its second-largest team in history for the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nIt takes a rare talent indeed to be able to jump straight into the cut and thrust of elite competition and look at home.\n\nEven for the world's greatest winter sports athletes, those who make sliding appear an art and seem to bend the most treacherous terrains to their will, baby steps are the wisest way to proceed, at first.\n\nWhich is why the start to Brown's World Cup career has been so extraordinary.\n\nOf course, Brown is not new to skiing \u2014 she has been on snow since she was 3, family trips to Mount Hotham sparking a love that was honed into artistry during five years living in Calgary, Canada.\n\n\"I think I just loved the thrill of it,\" she told ABC Sport from Aspen, Colorado, a day out from her fourth World Cup event, where she would finish fourth.\n\nIndra Brown made her first World Cup appearance at Secret Garden in Jiangjiakou, China. She won bronze. (Supplied: FIS/Li Runsheng)\n\n\"I think the fun aspect was a huge part of [pursuing freestyle skiing] and the creativity you can have just to express yourself and show the true love you have for the sport.\n\n\"You can be creative, change your style \u2014 there's no right or wrong in the sport.\n\n\"It just gives that way of freedom and a sense of just being able to express yourself in such a fun way.\"\n\nHaving fun is one thing. But surely not even in her wildest dreams did she expect to hit the ground running to the extent that she has done on the World Cup circuit.\n\nThere was that third place on debut in the 2022 Olympic halfpipe at the Secret Garden resort in Zhangjiakou.\n\nThen, a second place a fortnight later in Copper Mountain, Colorado.\n\nIndra Brown has soared high in record time. (Getty Images: Sean M Haffey)\n\nThen, remarkably, a maiden World Cup gold medal \u2014 in just her third World Cup start \u2014 on home snow in Calgary.\n\nIt was only the second time in history that an athlete won three medals in their first three World Cup freeski starts, equalling Swedish skier Jennie-Lee Burmansson.\n\n\"I think I just wanted to go in and land a run,\" Brown said of her breakout debut performance in China.\n\n\"I've been working really hard this season.\n\n\"So just to go out there and land a run I was really happy with \u2026 and then get the result I got, just made it even more incredible. I couldn't be happier.\n\n\"It definitely gave me lots of confidence just to know that I do belong here and I can contend with these incredible athletes.\n\n\"It boosted my confidence a lot, for sure.\"\n\n'It's a pretty special thing to be able to give a kid an opportunity to dare to dream'\n\nIndra Brown is shooting for the stars. (Getty Images: Lintao Zhang)\n\nBrown, one of four children, has been travelling the tour this season with her mum, Anne, and her younger brother, who also shows an aptitude for skiing.\n\nHer dad, Grant, has been back at home in Melbourne with her other two siblings for most of the year, but did head over to Canada and the USA for Christmas and will be in Livigno for the Olympics.\n\n\"For us it's just wonderful,\" Grant told ABC Sport.\n\n\"The happiness that the sport gives Indra.\n\n\"So long as she's still performing and she's really genuinely enjoying it, and it's her choice to do this, if all those planets align, it's a pretty special thing to be able to give a kid an opportunity to dare to dream and that's what she's thriving on at the moment.\"\n\nIndra Brown first skied in a halfpipe in Calgary, where she won her first World Cup gold. (AP Photo: The Canadian Press/Jeff McIntosh)\n\nGrant said one of the most important things \u2014 apart from ensuring that Indra kept up with her schoolwork \u2014 was how well his daughter had been welcomed onto the tour, a supportive environment that was allowing her to thrive, the Zhangjiakou champagne moment a perfect example.\n\n\"That sense of community is a really, really important thing,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got these athletes that come together from all parts of the world for competitions, or training camps or whatever, and they genuinely enjoy seeing each other, hanging out, as well as being able to ski together.\n\n\"That's been really reassuring for us as parents.\"\n\nIndra has plenty of people she can talk to about what it is like making the Olympics at such a young age.\n\nBrown will be the youngest Winter Olympian to represent Australia since Scotty James and Britteny Cox both competed as 15-year-olds.\n\nShe said that she had spoken to Guseli, who finished sixth in the snowboard halfpipe in Beijing as a 16-year-old and had gone on to become the only snowboarder in history to win a World Cup medal in all three park and pipe disciplines in a single season.\n\nIndra Brown won her first gold in Calgary, the first halfpipe she ever competed on. (Supplied: FIS Freeski)\n\nInjury stymied his quest for a spot in all three events at this year's Games, something Brown hopes to achieve in 2030 when the Games shift over to the French Alps.\n\n\"I've definitely been speaking to Val and all the other Aussie athletes, it's been super nice just to get their insight on taking in this experience,\" she said.\n\n\"It's such a special, once-in-a-lifetime thing. So just taking it in, not putting any pressure on myself, just having fun, enjoying the moment and just seeing where I go.\n\n\"It's been really special to have such a great team and group of athletes around me.\"\n\nBrown also credits her \"amazing\" mum and family for all their support as she competes, including keeping her supplied with a steady amount of the two Australian staples she can't live without: Weetbix and Up and Go.\n\nIt's things like that which, despite Brown having a definite Canadian twang, means she was never going to represent Canada in international competition: \"No,\" she said, \"I'm full Aussie\".\n\nAnd her stunning rise means she is heading to Milan a genuine medal chance.\n\n\"It's a dream come true to be able to represent Australia at the Olympics,\" she said.\n\n\"It's something I think, once I really start to get into skiing, I wanted to do for so long and dreamt of.\n\n\"To have this opportunity at my age and to be getting these experiences, it's just incredible.\n\n\"I'm so excited to get to Milan.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(Getty: Steve Granitz)\n\nLee had separated from Claire Danes \u2014 a Gen X icon, stealing hearts in Baz Luhrmann's electric 1996 film Romeo + Juliet \u2014 and was going through a \"spiritual crisis\" amid that implosion.\n\nIt was the end of a Bondi-to-Hollywood fairytale.\n\nThe actress began a new relationship with Billy Crudup that also left adrift actress Mary-Louise Parker, heavily pregnant at the time with baby Crudup.\n\nTwo very different men\n\nFor two men in a narrow field \u2014 super-famous male Australian musicians \u2014 Ben Lee and Bernard Fanning are very different people.\n\nThe frontman of one of the nation's most enduring bands, Powderfinger, Fanning had ground out an unsuccessful first album before the group exploded in popularity with its next effort, Double Allergic, in 1996.\n\nBy contrast, Lee broke out with punk band Noise Addict in 1995, barely 16 years old, before a hit solo record Breathing Tornados in 1998.\n\nAbrasive, ambitious and filled with accolades, he proclaimed himself the saviour of Australian music.\n\nFanning called him a \"precocious little c***\".\n\nTheir most famous run-in illustrates the essentially good-natured vibe of our music industry. We can talk about it as one of the great feuds of Australian music \u2014 when it was three words and Fanning later apologised.\n\nBen Lee's latest quirky career move Ben Lee has always been a fearless experimenter. But might his new gig selling essential oils puncture his popularity?\n\nLee was precocious \u2014 literally a child star, in a punk band in his early teens.\n\nA better description is that, in parallel with his light and love, Lee can be pugnacious.\n\nAwake Is The New Sleep is heavily influenced by his time in the US.\n\n\"I'm walking down Broadway / Each footstep is a new love letter,\" he coos on Begin, before the album goes on to name-check Beyonc\u00e9 and his mates Good Charlotte.\n\nIn the US, bigness is celebrated and brashness is just show business. When Lee describes gigs as hand-to-hand combat, he's not actually punching punters.\n\nBut he doesn't seem to mind the tension.\n\n\"They don't play me on the radio,\" he sings. \"And that's the way I like it\".\n\nBy contrast, Fanning is more of a Mr Australia (although not actually related to surfing champion Mick, as many believe).\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nHe self-deprecatingly describes the album as \"West End porch music\" and you can picture him and friends back then, strumming under the verandah of a rambling Queenslander, tooling around with an album that would still resonate 20 years on.\n\nWhere they were, where they are\n\nI saw both play gigs soon after the albums were released.\n\nAt a sweaty show in Melbourne's Corner Hotel, Lee's small stage was festooned with flowers, a nod to the album artwork. For someone who'd been through a lot, Lee seemed to be in a state of Zen-like calm throughout.\n\nThe soft guitar and keyboard intro of slow-burn Apple Candy began, a song about the triangular romantic situation.\n\nA crowd member cracked the silence.\n\n\"F*** you, Billy!\" they spat with venom.\n\nLee didn't even quiver. He kept strumming, serenely and slowly shaking his head.\n\nSmiling, he continued to play the song.\n\nInside Bernard Fanning's legendary debut album \"I happen to be in a band that's quite popular, but I don't really give a shit,\" Bernard Fanning said in 2005. \"For me, the important thing is to be able to keep writing songs.\"\n\nFanning played Melbourne's Festival Hall on what he called the \"last night of our world tour\".\n\nI've been lucky enough to see everyone from Soundgarden, INXS and Oasis to Kanye West and the Sugababes in that massive venue. But the roar when Wish You Well started is right up there.\n\nSingers Sime Nugent and Clare Bowditch joined him for Watch Over Me, rounding out a night that thousands of Melburnians will remember with great affection.\n\nFar from over\n\nLee spent last year on an anniversary tour for the album. The response was rapturous.\n\nAt the Melbourne gig, he ended each song with reverb, the sound wobbling out as the roars of applause took over.\n\nFor people who loved those albums \u2014 and those who've discovered them in the years since \u2014 many will have experienced a similar reverb in their own lives.\n\nFanning did a one-off gig in Queensland, which sold out in minutes, and is touring this year.\n\nPowderfinger would squeeze out two more albums before they called it a day: Dream Days at the Hotel Existence and Golden Rule. The band broke up in 2010.\n\nBoth Fanning and Lee kept creating.\n\nLee tours relentlessly. He has a podcast, Weirder Together, with his wife, actress Ione Skye, that mixes big questions, domestic challenges and top-tier name-dropping of late 90s, early 2000s US cultural icons. He keeps releasing new singles.\n\nFanning put our more excellent solo albums and in 2024 teamed up with Something For Kate frontman Paul Dempsey to create a supergroup self-titled album: Fanning Dempsey National Park.\n\nWhy Powderfinger got back together Bernard Fanning, Darren Middleton and Jon Coghill take us inside the Powderfinger camp.\n\nPowderfinger wasn't over either.\n\nWhen the country needed them the most \u2014 in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 they reformed for an online concert: One Night Lonely.\n\nAnd no-one really thinks they are done.\n\nCan you imagine the roar, at the 2032 Opening Ceremony of the Olympics in Brisbane, as The Veronicas fade out of Untouched and Powderfinger drop the guitar snarl of (Baby, I've Got You) On My Mind?\n\nYou'd hear it in Perth.\n\nDouble J relives the Hottest 100 of 2005 from midday Sunday.

(ABC News: Brad Ryan)\n\nHalf a century after the internet was born, online cruelty and the technology that fuels it have evolved in terrifying ways.\n\nCameras are no longer needed to perpetrate image-based abuse. Artificial intelligence is now easily harnessed to create fake pornography of real-life women.\n\nAn analysis published by the New York Times estimated one AI program, Grok, recently publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women in just nine days.\n\nSeparate research by an advocacy group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, estimated the number is closer to 3 million \u2013 including 23,000 images depicting children.\n\nThe chatbot, owned by Elon Musk, tightened restrictions on January 8, slowing the flood of explicit deepfakes \u2013 but many other programs exist, and new ones are being created all the time.\n\nAround the world, legislation and enforcement efforts are struggling to keep up. In Australia, deepfake image-based abuse is happening in schools every week, according to eSafety Commissioner data released in October.\n\nLike countless other girls and women, Hilton is now a constant victim.\n\n\"I know today that there are over 100,000 explicit deepfake images of me made by AI,\" she said.\n\n\"Not one of them is real, not one of them is consensual. And each time a new one appears, that horrible feeling returns, that fear that someone somewhere is looking at it right now and thinking it's real.\"\n\nParis Hilton met other anti-abuse advocates and posed for selfies outside the US Capitol. (ABC News: Brad Ryan)\n\nParty girl to politics\n\nHilton has travelled to Washington to put her famous name behind a proposed law to fight what she calls an \"epidemic\" of deepfakes.\n\nThe Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act \u2013 or DEFIANCE Act \u2013 would make it easier for victims to sue the creators of deepfake pornography.\n\nThe bill passed the US Senate unanimously last week and has bipartisan backing in the House of Representatives.\n\nIts chief supporters include Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Laurel Lee. Ms Ocasio-Cortez said there were positive signs that the House's Republican leadership would allow a vote.\n\nBut even if it passes, it has some obvious limitations. Wily deepfake creators can easily cover their tracks. And in any case, the legislation would only apply in the United States for what is a worldwide problem.\n\nBut Hilton's celebrity is adding weight to a broader global push to tackle the problem.\n\nAsked by the ABC if she planned to take her fight beyond Washington, Hilton said the American laws were the \"first step\".\n\n\"Obviously, this is happening all around the world,\" she said.\n\n\"And I want to help everyone around the world as much as I can \u2014 so, yes.\"\n\nWhat Australians think about AI We asked readers if they had thoughts or concerns about the rise of AI. This is what they told us.\n\nHotel heiress Hilton found celebrity in the early 2000s as a paparazzi-hounded socialite and, later, reality TV star. She leaned into a bimbo persona and was commonly derided as \"famous for being famous\".\n\nIn recent years, she has effectively channelled her fame into advocacy for anti-abuse causes.\n\nIn 2022, she met officials in the Biden White House to push for legal protections for institutionalised minors.\n\nShe later testified to Congress about her experiences in youth treatment centres, where she said she was \"force-fed medications and sexually abused by the staff\".\n\nIn late 2024, she returned to Capitol Hill to watch Congress pass the protections she lobbied for. Asked at the time if she would ever run for public office herself, she said: \"I can maybe see that happening.\"\n\nAsked the same question at Thursday's press conference, she said she was \"just happy to be here to support\" the cause.\n\n\"Coming here to the Capitol and to DC and doing my advocacy work has truly been the most meaningful work of my life,\" Hilton said.",

For me, I'm always trying to stay in the present, living with what's happening in the present.\n\n\"Of course, after a tough year like last year, knowing that this is my last Australian Open, my last year, it's really special.\n\n\"The emotion is really completely different. It's a feeling that's tough to describe.\n\n\"But it's the reason why at 40 I'm still pushing myself, pushing the limit, practising hard in the off-season. It's to live those moments.\"\n\nVeterans doing their thing\n\nWawrinka is not the only elder statesman on the ATP Tour wowing the spectators at Melbourne Park.\n\nAt 38, Novak Djokovic remains in the hunt for a record 11th Australian Open title, while 2018 runner-up Marin \u010cili\u0107 \u2014 a year younger than the Serb \u2014 has also reached the third round.\n\n\"I think it's great,\" Wawrinka said.\n\n\"I saw \u010cili\u0107 winning. It's good to see him back. He got some injury last year, too. It's good to see him at the right level.\n\n\"Novak is in a different league, anyway. We never compare ourselves to him. He's always there. He's always going to be there as long as he's playing.\n\n\"It's always amazing the way he can push everybody.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic is among the contenders for the Australian Open men's crown. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nFritz, the ninth seed, knows what to expect when he faces Wawrinka on Saturday.\n\nAnd the American will not be surprised if the pair go the distance across five sets.\n\n\"It's so impressive the level and just the physicality he's still bringing,\" Fritz said.\n\n\"The obvious thing is fitness, but then the other thing is just, I'd say, being a really good competitor.\n\n\"People that compete really well tend to win out over the longer matches. It speaks to how great a competitor he is.\"",

        "text": "National Basketball League star Marcus Lee has cautioned against pushing people away from important conversations about LGBTQIA+ rights by taking an all-or-nothing approach to Pride rounds.\n\nStarting this week, the NBL is celebrating its fourth Pride Round, with all courts decked out in the Pride flag and players invited to wear jerseys featuring the same logo.\n\nThe New Zealand Breakers have opted out of wearing the Pride flag on their uniforms.\n\nA statement from the club said it still \"strongly supports\" the event, but some players had raised religious and cultural concerns about wearing the Pride flag.\n\n\"In line with the league's voluntary participation policy to wear the patch, the players discussed the matter as a team,\" the statement from the Breakers said.\n\n\"To protect individual players from being singled out for their beliefs, the team collectively decided they would either all wear the insignia or none would.\"\n\nChange possible in middle ground, Lee says\n\nIn 2022, Isaac Humphries \u2014 then with Melbourne United, now with the Adelaide 36ers \u2014 became the first openly gay male to play in the NBL and the second in any top-tier basketball league in the world.\n\nLee is one of Humphries's close friends and has this year volunteered to be included in promotional content for Pride Round as an ally.\n\nMarcus Lee says his friendship with Isaac Humphries helped shape his support for the NBL\u2019s Pride round as an ally. (Getty Images: Morgan Hancock)\n\nThe American import said forcing players to wear the rainbow flag on their jersey would undermine the round's purpose of fostering open dialogue.\n\nIn the Breakers' case, he said the outcome was not as important as the fact that they had discussed it.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, these conversations weren't happening, and it was not an option \u2014 we didn't have jerseys, we didn't have the conversation,\" he said.\n\n\"And now it's something that a coach or an owner has to sit down with the team like, 'How do you guys feel about this?'\n\n\"It's still an option, it's still your choice, but we want to make sure that they have all the information, and then we get everybody's side on it.\n\n\"It gives people a little bit more grace.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Cairns Taipans made a similar decision not to wear the rainbow logo for Pride Round, though they have worn one every year since.\n\nIn 2024, the Taipans announced an official partnership with Pride in Sport \u2014 a national not-for-profit sporting inclusion program \u2014 which is hosting \"Empowering Allies\" training sessions for players, coaches and staff across the league during this year's Pride Round.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nLee, who joined the Taipans last year, said change usually happened in the middle ground.\n\n\"You don't want to force anything on anybody, and that's not the point of this,\" he said.\n\n\"You want to start this conversation, and then slowly things alter. That's what made me really excited this year \u2014 we have a bunch of guys who are just open to the conversation.\n\n\"We're not here to change your opinion, but we just want to make a place where everybody's comfortable to be who they are.\"\n\nLee said the NBL provided a useful lesson to other leagues yet to introduce Pride rounds: it does not have to be all or nothing.\n\n\"It might not be every team in every league starting immediately, but I think the biggest thing is it takes one domino to just start that,\" he said.\n\n\"We're trying to take one step at a time.\"\n\n'Everybody is welcome', says Humphries\n\nHumphries was unavailable for interview as he prepares for Friday's game against the Breakers in New Zealand, but echoed Lee's sentiments in a conversation with former NBL player AJ Ogilvy \u2014 who this week came out publicly as gay.\n\n\"It's not anything about forcing; it's just a bit of visibility for a community,\" Humphries said.\n\n\"Learning to stop the judgement, accept people for who they are \u2014 that's literally what we're about, that's our through line.\n\n\"I would just always encourage others to see that and understand that mindset. We're just people trying to accept and include literally everybody.\"\n\nLGBTQI+ community support services ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends.\n\nOgilvy, who played for the Sydney Kings and Illawarra Hawks in a 218-game NBL career, said he was happy to see engagement with Pride Round grow year on year.\n\n\"There's now a place for us to have this conversation, for us to be able to talk as openly as this,\" Ogilvy said.\n\n\"I don't think it's trying to exclude people; we want to try to bring people in, not push people away.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be people on the court. Pride Round is for everyone. It's people in the stands. It's people at home watching. It's about making sure everyone feels included.\"\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport?

        "text": "It might still be January but with the 98th Academy Awards nominations released in the early hours of Australian morning \u2014 the Oscars are officially in sight!\n\nMusical horror-hybrid Sinners leads this year's cohort, securing a record-breaking 16 nominations, including Best Picture, Director and Original Screenplay.\n\nNot far behind is Paul Thomas Anderson's revolutionary tale One Battle After Another \u2014 largely considered the one to beat for Best Picture \u2014 on 13 nominations.\n\nOscar nods for Aussie actors Jacob Elordi and Rose Byrne Vampire film Sinners broke the Academy Award record for nominations with 16, while Rose Byrne was recognised for If I had Legs I'd Kick You and Jacob Elordi got a nod for his role in Frankenstein.\n\nInternational films also showed up in a big way this year, with two \u2014 Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value and Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's The Secret Agent \u2014 both securing multiple nominations, including Best Picture.\n\nJafar Panahi's illegally filmed It Was Just an Accident and \u00d3liver Laxe's Sir\u0101t also managed to nab additional nominations on top of their Best International Film nods.\n\nThis year's Academy Awards will take place on March 15 (March 16 for Australians) but, until then, let's dive into the snubs, surprises and successes from the 2026 Oscar nominations.\n\nSuccess: Aussies lock it down\n\nDon't get it twisted, Australians usually clean up alright at the Oscars, but this year we have multiple shots at bringing gold home.\n\nRose Byrne at the edge of motherhood The Sydney-born movie star discusses how her creative partnership with If I had Legs I'd Kick You director Mary Bronstein has opened the Oscars conversation.\n\nAll-season Rose Byrne's exasperated performance in dark comedy If I Had Legs I'd Kick You has been the quiet frontrunner for Best Lead Actress.\n\nHer competition comes in the form of Hamnet's Jessie Buckley; the pair have been alternating wins at key ceremonies for months.\n\nThey BOTH took home statues for Best Lead Actress in their respective genres at the Globes, so this one will be a nailbiter.\n\nOver in possibly the most competitive category (Best Supporting Actor) is Jacob Elordi for his immensely physical turn as the Creature in Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein remake.\n\nElordi nabbed a surprise Critics' Choice Award earlier in the month, but facing off against Academy favourites like Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro could mean an uphill battle for the boy from Brisbane .\n\nRounding out our Aussie representation is musician Nick Cave sneaking into Best Original Song for his and The National's Bryce Dessner's contribution to Best Picture nominee Train Dreams.\n\nThe category is pretty much on lock for Golden from KPop Demon Hunters, but stranger things have happened at the Oscars.\n\nAnd while Train Dreams is technically an American film, it stars Aussie Joel Edgerton so we might as well go ahead and claim that too.\n\nJacob Elordi sat through a whopping 11 hours of make-up to become the Creature in Netflix's Frankenstein. (Netflix)\n\nSurprise: F1 zooms into Best Picture race\n\nAs with most years, there were around six films that made such an impact it was impossible to imagine them NOT getting a Best Picture nod.\n\nWhich leaves around four spaces for wildcards.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz about multiple international films, such as Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident and Park Chan-wook's No Other Choice, defying Academy tastes to nab a nomination.\n\nBut in the end, the voting bloc went with good ol' US popcorn fodder with Brad Pitt vehicle F1: The Movie.\n\nPushing a car-centric film into Best Picture isn't unheard of: Ford v Ferrari snuck into the 2019 race among much stronger contenders, but it's an indication that the Academy is holding on tight to the crowd-pleasing, cinema filler.\n\nIn the F1 movie, Brad Pitt is a former elite race car driver turned van-lifer who flits across the globe and avoids his feelings. (Supplied: Warner Bros)\n\nSnub: Wicked banished for good\n\nLess of a snub and more of a slow snuff out, Wicked: For Good began awards season as a Best Picture frontrunner only to tumble off the tornado with a big ol' goose egg.\n\nWicked: For Good captures the spirit of the stage musical\u2019s second act \u2014 for better and for worse Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo shine in Wicked: For Good, but the sequel doesn't live up to the thrill of its predecessor.\n\nThe first film collected a robust 10 nominations, including for Best Picture, and placed a Best Supporting Actress win tantalisingly close to Ariana Grande.\n\nBut lacklustre reviews and fading cultural relevance seems to have caught up with the Broadway adaptation. Not only did Grande and lead Cynthia Erivo miss out, but For Good was completely shut out of the technical categories which it won last time around.\n\nPerhaps the most painful part is the musical's failure to secure even a Best Original Song nod, a category they missed last time due to eligibility, but was thought of as a shoo-in due to legendary composer Stephen Schwartz contributing two original songs to the sequel.\n\nSuccess: Sinners makes Academy history\n\nMove over Titanic, Sinners is now the most nominated film in Academy history! The hybrid horror bit off a whopping 16 nominations this morning, trouncing previous record holders Titanic, All About Eve and La La Land on 14.\n\nWith a nomination in nearly every eligible category, including Picture, Director, Original Screenplay and three out of four acting categories, it's almost enough to make you think the Academy's dislike of horror has evaporated.\n\nWhat really pushed their nomination collection into record territory is a surprise Supporting Actor nod for veteran actor Delroy Lindo's turn as callused blues master Delta Slim.\n\nBritish actor Wunmi Mosaku picked up a Best Supporting Actress nod for her work in Sinners. (Supplied: Warner Bros)\n\nSinners shouldn't start counting its chickens yet though; the film has led nominations lists numerous times this season only to come up frustratingly short. Here's hoping Ryan Coogler's incredible vampire story can leave its mark on the Oscars.\n\nSurprise: Best casting skips sentimentality\n\nThe new kid on the category block is Best Casting, making its debut at the 2026 ceremony.\n\nThe inaugural nominees aren't so remarkable for what they contain but rather for what they lack.\n\nJoachim Trier's Sentimental Value has cut through this season with mighty force for an international film, even securing a rare Best Picture nod.\n\nSentimental Value reunites actor Renate Reinsve with director Joachim Trier. (Supplied: Cannes)\n\nBut it was nowhere to be seen in casting this morning, despite four of its ensemble picking up acting nods including a double nomination in Supporting Actress for Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas. It's a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nSnub: Sorry, Sorry, Baby\n\nEven the praise of Julia Roberts wasn't enough to land Eva Victor's dazzling debut an Oscar nomination.\n\nSorry, Baby was rarely in talks for Best Picture but its laundry list of awards-season nominations and wins had some pundits hoping Victor's achingly grounded script might just sneak into Best Original Screenplay.\n\nAlas, there was no love for Sorry, Baby this morning. But let's look at the kitten on the promo image just one more time.\n\nSorry, Baby is the debut feature film from writer, director and star Eva Victor. (Supplied: VVS Films)\n\nSuccess: Lil Timmy Tim inches closer to 'greatness'\n\nIf it wasn't clear enough from his audacious speech at last year's SAG awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wants an Oscar bad \u2014 like 2014 Leonardo DiCaprio bad.\n\nAlready a double Oscar nominee at 30, Chalamet might prove third time's the charm with his nomination today for Best Lead Actor for Marty Supreme.\n\nChalamet is chasing the Oscar hard with Marty Supreme. (Supplied: A24)\n\nChalamet's hype-beast PR stunts proved fruitful for the ping pong movie's box office but his respectful revelry has worked wonders with awards voters with Chalamet picking up both the Critics Choice and Golden Globe for his troubles.\n\nEven if there is a shock snub for Timmy come March, he can hang his hat on being the youngest actor since Marlon Brando to receive three nominations for Best Leading Actor.\n\nSurprise: The Ugly Stepsister transforms into Oscar nominee\n\nEvery year there's one most unexpected surprise buried in the technical categories and this year it comes in the most disgusting package.\n\nThe Ugly Stepsister is a tiny, independent and repulsive re-imagining of Cinederella told from the perspective of an overlooked sibling who goes to extreme lengths to measure up to the family's golden girl.\n\nFull of intentionally broken bones, sliced feet and ingested tapeworms, the body horror managed to sneak into Best Makeup and Hair-styling.\n\nIt's the first nomination for streaming service Shudder, which has been dutifully keeping fans of original horror fed for a decade, and hopefully indicates the Academy's increasing warmth towards weird horror.\n\nSnub: Mescal misses the mark\n\nWhispers of Oscar-bait have done little to dash the chances of Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's Hamnet, a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's family tragedy.\n\nThe weepy drama scored eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Zhao, but one name that was curiously absent was Paul Mescal, The Bard himself.\n\nPaul Mescal plays a semi-fictional version of William Shakespeare in Hamnet. (Supplied: Universal)\n\nMany considered him a contender for Best Supporting Actor due to his full-hearted performance and previous Oscar nomination but alas, it's not to be.",

        "text": "Despite a couple of heatwave events, people who enjoy Australian table grapes across the globe will have access to a good variety and quality of fruit this year.\n\nPicking has begun for the local industry, with the majority of produce to be sent overseas, predominantly to Asia.\n\nAustralian Table Grape Association chief executive Jeff Scott said he was optimistic about the season after the first year of full varietal access to Japan.\n\n\"It's still early days, but we've done our trade briefings in about five or six countries now in Asia, and the indications are that the demand is going to be very strong again,\" he said.\n\nAustralia previously only exported three varieties of table grapes to Japan \u2013 crimson seedless, red globe and Thompson seedless.\n\nNew red grape varieties, like Ruby Rush, have meant an earlier start to harvest. (Supplied: Talia Farms)\n\nBut after a successful campaign to remove the unique trade barrier, growers can supply the market with more than 130 table grape varieties.\n\n\"Japan last year increased our exports by 300 per cent,\" Mr Scott said.\n\nHe said exports went from about 3,500 tonnes to nearly 10,000 tonnes.\n\n\"It's something that we've been working on for quite a while, and we're very pleased that we've been able to achieve,\" he said.\n\nAustralia has a free trade agreement with Japan and first exported table grapes there in 2014.\n\nMr Scott said he was pleased that the industry group was one of nine horticultural commodity groups included in the federal government's Trade Diversification Network.\n\n\"It might mean additional promotional activities, it might mean supporting inbound and outbound trade missions,\" he said.\n\nPick to plate\n\nEnsuring high-quality fruit for export requires a dedicated workforce and innovative practices.\n\nAt Talia Farms in South Australia's Riverland, one of the country's largest table grape farms, fruit can go from vine to shelf in as little as 48 hours.\n\nWorkers at Talia Farms pack table grapes by day. (Supplied: Talia Farms)\n\nFrom budburst to harvest, the workforce at the 230-hectare property and pack shed grows from 13 permanent employees to a team of almost 80.\n\nFarm manager Bill Avery said it required an around-the-clock operation, with some workers starting their day wearing headlamps to pick in the dark.\n\n\"We start picking at 3 o'clock in the morning or 2.30, depending on the dew point,\" he said.\n\n\"By 9am the pickers are finished and the pack shed is full.\n\n\"We go right through to 6pm, so our fruit is then stored ready for dispatch that night.\"\n\nMr Avery said the practices helped ensure the longevity and quality of the fruit.\n\n\"We are getting an extra three or four days' shelf life on the fruit because it's being picked when it is cool as opposed to being picked when it's hot,\" he said.\n\nMr Avery said it usually took a few weeks to ship table grapes, but the premium paid for fruit ahead of Chinese New Year justified air freight.\n\n\"We're looking at 48 hours from dispatch to being in a fruit shop in South-East Asia,\" he said.\n\nThe business, owned by US-based company RPG Capital Management, is on the market, but Mr Avery said the existing management would remain when a new investor took over.\n\nDespite a strong fruit-growing season, he said Australian consumers of grapes were unlikely to see it flow through to local prices.\n\n\"It is controlled by three to five major players,\" Mr Avery said.\n\n\"So unless you are in with those groups, it's very hard to break in with the supermarket chains because they won't entertain an individual grower base.\"",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Australian sharemarket climbed into the green by lunchtime after more gains on Wall Street, as US stocks regained more of their losses for the week following the latest walk back by President Donald Trump from his most severe threats over Greenland. The S&P/ASX 200 started the session slightly lower but was up 24.2 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 8872.9 points, with four of 11 industry sectors higher, with stocks tied to gold jumping after the price of the safe haven rebounded. Wall Street advanced again, a day after Donald Trump backtracked on threats to hit European countries with tariffs amid the stoush over Greenland. Bloomberg Among the miners, Rio Tinto shed 1.2 per cent and BHP advanced 0.3 per cent while Fortescue dropped 0.5 per cent to extend its losses from Thursday. Gold miners rebounded from sharp losses in the previous session, with Northern Star rising 6.9 per cent and Evolution Mining jumping 7.2 per cent on Friday. Financial stocks gave up some of Thursday\u2019s strong gains, with Commonwealth Bank (down 1.3 per cent), Westpac (down 0.8 per cent), National Australia Bank (down 0.8 per cent) and ANZ Bank (down 1.2 per cent) all losing ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy stocks were lower, with Woodside Energy slipping 0.6 per cent while Santos lost 0.2 per cent and Yancoal was flat. The Australian dollar continued to strengthen and was trading at US68.49\u00a2 at 12.33pm AEDT. Related Article Opinion\n\nOil Trump\u2019s devious deal hits China\u2019s wallet \u2013 and its influence Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Overnight, the S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent and added to its big gain from Wednesday, when Trump said he had reached \u201cthe framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\u201d and called off 10 per cent tariffs for European countries that he said opposed his having the Arctic island. The index has recovered most of the losses it took after Trump shook financial markets with his initial tariff threat. The Dow Jones climbed 306 points, or 0.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s U-turn is the latest example of him making a big, initial threat, only to pull back after seeing how much pain it created in financial markets. The pattern has led to the \u201cTACO\u201d acronym, suggesting that \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d if markets react strongly enough. Tuesday\u2019s drop for the US stock market was the worst since October and large enough that Trump, who often takes credit when Wall Street is doing well, acknowledged \u201cthe dip.\u201d But the pattern has also led to deals for Trump that outsiders may have initially considered unlikely if not for his market-shaking opening moves. Details are still sparse about the framework of a deal on Greenland that Trump said he reached with the head of NATO. And it is not a signed deal yet. Financial markets were still showing some signs of nervousness on Thursday. Gold\u2019s price swiveled between small losses and gains before turning 1.6 per cent higher. Its price often rises when investors are looking for something safer to own. The value of the US dollar also weakened against the euro and several other foreign currencies. But Treasury yields held relatively steady in a signal that foreign investors weren\u2019t rushing out of the US bond market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYields got some support from reports on the US economy\u2019s strength that came in better than expected. One said fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected in a potential signal that the pace of layoffs remains low. A second suggested the US economy grew at a faster rate during the summer than the government initially estimated. A third said that inflation in November was close to economists\u2019 expectations, while spending by US consumers was a touch better than expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed as high as 4.28 per cent following the reports, but it later eased to 4.25 per cent from 4.26 per cent late Wednesday. On Wall Street, Northern Trust climbed 6 per cent after reporting a stronger profit for the end of 2025 than analysts expected. CEO Michael O\u2019Grady also said that the financial services company is entering 2026 with \u201cstrong momentum across all our businesses.\u201d Procter & Gamble added 2.6 per cent after likewise delivering a better profit than analysts expected. Revenue for the company behind the Downy, Pantene and Tide brands, though, fell just shy of expectations amid what CEO Shailesh Jejurikar called a \u201cchallenging consumer and geopolitical environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShares of BitGo, a company that helps crypto businesses and traditional financial firms hold and manage digital assets, rose 2.7 per cent in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company priced its stock at $US18 per share in its initial public offering, above its earlier estimated range of $US15 to $US17. JPMorgan Chase rose 0.5 per cent after a lawsuit filed by Trump against the bank caused minor ripples for its stock. Trump accused JPMorgan Chase of closing his accounts for political reasons after he left office in 2021. They helped offset an 8.1 per cent drop for spice seller McCormick & Co., whose profit fell short of expectations. CEO Brendan Foley said it continues to face rising costs because of \u201ca shifting global trade environment.\u201d All told, the S&P 500 rose 37.73 points to 6,913.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 306.78 to 49,384.01, and the Nasdaq composite gained 211.20 to 23,436.02. In stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across Europe and Asia amid relief on Trump\u2019s walk back of tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nInvesting Team TACO cashes in as Trump folds again Elizabeth Knight Business columnist Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX returned 1.2 per cent for two of the world\u2019s bigger moves. Global markets also got support from a continued easing of long-term yields in Japan\u2019s bond market. They had spiked early in the week on worries that Japan\u2019s popular prime minister could make moves that would add heavily to the government\u2019s already big debt. But the 40-year Japanese government bond yield has come back since hitting a record and dropped below 4 per cent on Thursday after hitting 4.22 per cent on Tuesday.

Got it Share A A A\n\nIt\u2019s a year for creatively ambitious Hollywood movies backed by substantial budgets at the Academy Awards, with Sinners, One Battle After Another, Marty Supreme and Frankenstein heavily nominated early this morning. And it is also a year for ambitious non-English-language films from other parts of the world with The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value featuring among the contenders. With the nominations dominated by stories about central characters challenging power in different forms, Australia has first-time nominations for Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You), Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein) and, for best original song, Nick Cave (Train Dreams). Production designer Fiona Crombie, who has been nominated previously for The Favourite, is back for Hamnet. In raw numbers, Sinners leads the way with a record 16 nominations \u2013 boosted by the inclusion of a new Oscar for best casting. Next is One Battle with 13 nominations and Frankenstein, Marty Supreme and Sentimental Value all with nine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining them with best picture nominations are Hamnet, Bugonia, F1, The Secret Agent and Train Dreams. The good Byrne\u2019s best actress nomination is one of the feel-good stories of the nominations. While If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You was weirdly in the musical or comedy category when she won at the Golden Globes, Byrne is exceptional as a stressed-out American therapist in a tense drama with a horror edge. Nominated: Rose Byrne with rapper A$AP Rocky in If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You. AP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver two decades working in the US, she has shone in Bridesmaids and multiple Insidious, X-Men and Neighbours movies, and, on TV, in Damages, Mrs America and Physical. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Byrne told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve snuck into the back of the bus. I can\u2019t believe we got in this extraordinary group of women ... \u201cI love the Oscars. [When I was a] little girl from Sydney, Australia, I used to watch [the show]. The pageantry of it is so fun and theatrical.\u201d Related Article Oscars Rose Byrne, Jacob Elordi lead Australia\u2019s Oscars charge as Sinners makes history Elordi continues his striking Hollywood rise with a best supporting actor nomination at 28 \u2013 two years younger than boy wonder Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who is one of the favourites to win best actor for Marty Supreme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe gave heart and deep feeling to the Creature, who emerges from a demented lab and discovers the curse of eternal life, in Frankenstein. Even in the early stages, when his character was chained up and knew only the single word \u201cVictor\u201d, Elordi made him compelling to watch. Nick Cave\u2019s Train Dreams \u2013 Bryce Dessner co-wrote the music \u2013 was a haunting closer to the poetic drama Train Dreams. It will be an outsider at the Oscars, however, given it is up against Golden from the pop culture phenomenon that is KPop Demon Hunters. Without discounting the merits of One Battle After Another, Marty Supreme and Hamnet, Sinners deserves to lead the nominations. At a time when cinema fans regularly lament the lack of original films, writer-director Ryan Coogler delivered one that ambitiously fused genres, spoke about race and class in America and took creative risks. Deservedly nominated: Jacob Elordi as the creature in Frankenstein. Ken Woroner/Netflix The bad\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoel Edgerton has been close to an Oscar nomination before, for playing an FBI agent in Black Mass a decade ago. This year he absolutely deserved to be recognised for his heartbreaking performance as an early 20th century itinerant logger and railroad labourer in Train Dreams. There is so much emotion \u2013 suppressed and occasionally overflowing \u2013 in a quiet character who experiences horror, loneliness and grief but endures to finally feel like he understands life in his last years. Train Dreams is up for best picture, adapted screenplay, cinematography and original song; the Australian actor who made it so moving has sadly missed out. While there are two non-English-language films up for best picture, Sentimental Value and The Secret Agent, the Academy overlooked the best one. Jafar Panahi\u2019s It Was Just An Accident is a tense and twisting thriller, darkly comic, about the abuse of power in Iran that won the Palme d\u2019Or, the major prize, at Cannes. Nick Cave, who is nominated for best original song for Train Dreams, performing in London with the Bad Seeds. Megan Cullen\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPanahi, who had already been jailed for \u201ccreating propaganda against the system\u201d and supporting anti-government protesters, made it in secret to avoid government censorship, and his courage and craft should have been rewarded with a best director nomination as well. And how unlucky were Chase Infiniti, the breakout star as the daughter of a revolutionary in One Battle, and Paul Mescal, who played Shakespeare in Hamnet? Their categories, best actress and actor, were so competitive this time around that they missed out. Way back in 2002, when Will Smith was nominated for best actor for Ali, he told me the Academy had historically overlooked deserving African-American actors and gave Delroy Lindo from Malcolm X, Get Shorty and Cider House Rules as evidence. At 73, Lindo has finally received a nomination. He is up for best supporting actor for playing a legendary blues musician in Sinners. Should have been nominated: Joel Edgerton in Train Dreams. Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ugly Voters decided that sequels were ugly. There are no nominations for Wicked: For Good, not even for Ariana Grande\u2019s performance as Glinda, and Avatar: Fire and Ice is only up for best visual effects, which it might well win, and costume design. Ariana Grande as Glinda in Wicked: For Good. AP While Frankenstein and Sinners deserved to be up for best make-up and hairstyling, alongside the little-seen Kokuho and The Ugly Stepsister, I was never sure what to make of Dwayne Johnson\u2019s transformation into a tormented UFC fighter in The Smashing Machine. His performance was impressive, but the character\u2019s look felt awkward and forced. Still, he did not look like Dwayne Johnson, which I guess was the triumph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oscars take place on Monday, March 16, Australian time.

If it happens, it happens.\u201d What about the five-year offer from Rugby Australia? \u201cI\u2019m still signed to the Tahs and Rugby Australia this year. We\u2019re still working through a few things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m loving my time playing at the Tahs, but we\u2019ll get through this year and see what happens. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to [get it done early], but sometimes it\u2019s not up to you. Hopefully, it works itself out. Max Jorgensen with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii at Waratahs training in Mudgee. Credit: Amber Hooper \u201cI like to keep my cards close to my chest. Obviously, a home World Cup is massive. It doesn\u2019t come around too often. I do know to play in a home World Cup would be really cool.\u201d The addition of Crichton and Nawaqanitawase, will that be factored into your decision?\n\n\u201cAngus and Marky are two very talented athletes who have done great things in union, including \u2018Gus\u2019 at schoolboys level, and Marky with the Tahs and Wallabies,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cTo have them back in the game is exciting. They\u2019re two amazing players. You do want to play with the best players. They\u2019re elite with experience. \u2018I\u2019m loving my time playing at the Tahs, but we\u2019ll get through this year and see what happens.\u2019 Max Jorgensen on his future \u201cI want to win a Super Rugby title with the Tahs. With the Wallabies, there are Bledisloes, World Cups, even trying to win against the British and Irish Lions. They are all things that are on your bucket list when growing up. \u201cBut like I said, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nWaratahs coach Dan McKellar spoke for everyone in rugby when he said: \u201cIf we get that [deal] done sooner rather than later, everyone will sleep that little bit easier. \u201cI can understand why the Roosters, or any NRL club, would be interested. He\u2019s an elite talent. Max Jorgensen in Mudgee where the Waratahs spent a week training. Credit: Amber Hooper \u201cHopefully, he\u2019s comfortable and enjoying where he is at the moment, and he feels valued. Max loves rugby union and what the game can offer. \u201cHe will be [well] remunerated, regardless of where he plays.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be pretty confident he\u2019s enjoying the environment we have here at the Waratahs, and he\u2019ll enjoy it with the Wallabies. \u201cMax\u2019s greatest strength is his humility. He\u2019s not a self-promoter. He\u2019s incredibly humble, comes from a good family, and doesn\u2019t get ahead of himself. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it many times before when 21-year-olds all of a sudden become superstars overnight, and they can get ahead of themselves. That\u2019s certainly not the case with Max.\u201d Jorgensen was born in England, but grew up in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, playing rugby with the Balmain Wolves, and league with the Leichhardt Juniors, later switching to the Concord Wolves once the Juniors folded. He was in the Balmain Harold Matthews\u2019 team that featured Wests Tigers forward Tony Sukkar.\n\nOne of Jorgensen\u2019s earliest memories was wearing a Roosters jersey and supporting the club where his father spent two seasons and racked up 20 tries in the 1990s. Peter celebrated tries with the \u201caeroplane\u201d, which Max said he might produce this season. \u201cI\u2019ve seen videos of it \u2013 I might have to bring it out this year,\u201d he said, with a smile. Max Jorgensen playing for the Waratahs last year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI leaned on dad a lot when I was younger, and definitely when I was transitioning into professional footy. I still do now, and he\u2019ll give me pointers after each game. \u201cDad always leaned towards supporting the Roosters, and it rubbed off on me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve followed them my whole life. I did a pre-season with the club under Robbo a couple of years ago, which was also the first time I met \u2018Su\u2019 [Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii]. \u201cI loved Robbo as a coach, he\u2019s a great bloke as well and a great man.\u201d Brad Fittler is Roosters\u2019 royalty, while his son, Zach, is now with the Waratahs, and played against Jorgensen in the GPS first XV schoolboys competition. If Jorgensen switched, Fittler said there was no question about him being a success. \u201cHe could make it as fullback or five-eighth; there was a time I thought he could have been too small, but some of the best players in our comp are now small,\u201d Fittler said. \u201cHe\u2019s tough, has a great skill set, and he reads the game well.\u201d\n\nLoading The Roosters could do with a fullback or winger like Jorgensen. Fullback James Tedesco is signed until the end of next year, and although he is in the kind of form to keep playing until he is 40, the skipper cannot go on forever. Veteran winger Daniel Tupou is in the same boat, while Nawaqanitawase\u2019s exit creates another wing opening. The Roosters have also had success starting two of their great fullbacks \u2013 Anthony Minichiello and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck \u2013 on the wing before transitioning to the No. 1. Jorgensen gives little away, but there is no hint of arrogance. He is tight with Suaalii. He was genuinely unsure if he needed a shirt for this masthead\u2019s photo shoot, and politely asked if the zinc on his face would be an unwanted distraction for the photographer.",

Now I've had a shot of adrenaline and I'm wide awake.\"\n\nThe movie follows the story of Linda (played by Byrne), a therapist navigating the harsh challenges of motherhood.\n\nDirector Mary Bronstein told SBS News last year she wanted to \"create a portrait of a mother I had never seen before\".\n\n\"When I thought about it, I was like: What movie have I ever seen where it centres a woman who happens to have a child, but it's not about her mothering and it doesn't judge her and it lets her be an actual human being? That's written and made by a woman?\"\n\nByrne is up against Jessie Buckley in Hamnet, Kate Hudson in Song Sung Blue, Renate Reinsve in Sentimental Value and Emma Stone in Bugonia.\n\nJacob Elordi has been nominated for his role in Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein. Source: AAP / AP/Netflix\n\nElordi's nomination for his role in Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein is one of nine for the Netflix film.\n\nSpeaking to the Hollywood Reporter, the Brisbane-born actor said he was \"beside himself\" after receiving the news.\n\n\"I am so excited. I mean, I'm 28 years old. It's wind in the sails,\" he said.\n\nCave was nominated for the title song to Clint Bentley's film Train Dreams, which stars Australian actor Joel Edgerton.\n\nEdgerton, the central pillar of Train Dreams, was not nominated, though the picture earned four nominations, including best picture.\n\nAustralian costume and production designer Fiona Crombie has also been nominated for an Oscar this year, in the best production design category for her work on Hamnet.\n\nSinners, starring Michael \u200dB Jordan, landed a record 16 nominations.

Pictures/AP\n\nSinners sets new record\n\nSinners, a segregation-era vampire thriller starring Michael \u200dB Jordan, has stormed into the awards race with the most Academy Award nominations of any film this year, landing a record 16 nods.\n\nThe large haul sets up Sinners as the \u2060frontrunner heading into the 15 March Oscars, where it will face off against contenders One Battle After Another, Frankenstein, Hamnet, Marty Supreme and others for the coveted best picture prize.\n\nThe previous record for most nominations in a single year was 14, a mark hit by All About \u200cEve, Titanic and La La Land.\n\nBugonia, F1, The Secret Agent, Sentimental Value and Train Dreams were also nominated for this \u200dyear's best picture trophy.\n\nWinners of the gold Oscar statuettes will be chosen by the roughly 10,000 actors, producers, directors and film craftspeople who make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nComedian Conan O'Brien will host for the second year.\n\n- With additional reporting from Reuters\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Australian sharemarket climbed into the green by lunchtime after more gains on Wall Street, as US stocks regained more of their losses for the week following the latest walk back by President Donald Trump from his most severe threats over Greenland. The S&P/ASX 200 started the session slightly lower but was up 24.2 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 8872.9 points, with four of 11 industry sectors higher, with stocks tied to gold jumping after the price of the safe haven rebounded. Wall Street advanced again, a day after Donald Trump backtracked on threats to hit European countries with tariffs amid the stoush over Greenland. Bloomberg Among the miners, Rio Tinto shed 1.2 per cent and BHP advanced 0.3 per cent while Fortescue dropped 0.5 per cent to extend its losses from Thursday. Gold miners rebounded from sharp losses in the previous session, with Northern Star rising 6.9 per cent and Evolution Mining jumping 7.2 per cent on Friday. Financial stocks gave up some of Thursday\u2019s strong gains, with Commonwealth Bank (down 1.3 per cent), Westpac (down 0.8 per cent), National Australia Bank (down 0.8 per cent) and ANZ Bank (down 1.2 per cent) all losing ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy stocks were lower, with Woodside Energy slipping 0.6 per cent while Santos lost 0.2 per cent and Yancoal was flat. The Australian dollar continued to strengthen and was trading at US68.49\u00a2 at 12.33pm AEDT. Related Article Opinion\n\nOil Trump\u2019s devious deal hits China\u2019s wallet \u2013 and its influence Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Overnight, the S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent and added to its big gain from Wednesday, when Trump said he had reached \u201cthe framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\u201d and called off 10 per cent tariffs for European countries that he said opposed his having the Arctic island. The index has recovered most of the losses it took after Trump shook financial markets with his initial tariff threat. The Dow Jones climbed 306 points, or 0.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s U-turn is the latest example of him making a big, initial threat, only to pull back after seeing how much pain it created in financial markets. The pattern has led to the \u201cTACO\u201d acronym, suggesting that \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d if markets react strongly enough. Tuesday\u2019s drop for the US stock market was the worst since October and large enough that Trump, who often takes credit when Wall Street is doing well, acknowledged \u201cthe dip.\u201d But the pattern has also led to deals for Trump that outsiders may have initially considered unlikely if not for his market-shaking opening moves. Details are still sparse about the framework of a deal on Greenland that Trump said he reached with the head of NATO. And it is not a signed deal yet. Financial markets were still showing some signs of nervousness on Thursday. Gold\u2019s price swiveled between small losses and gains before turning 1.6 per cent higher. Its price often rises when investors are looking for something safer to own. The value of the US dollar also weakened against the euro and several other foreign currencies. But Treasury yields held relatively steady in a signal that foreign investors weren\u2019t rushing out of the US bond market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYields got some support from reports on the US economy\u2019s strength that came in better than expected. One said fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected in a potential signal that the pace of layoffs remains low. A second suggested the US economy grew at a faster rate during the summer than the government initially estimated. A third said that inflation in November was close to economists\u2019 expectations, while spending by US consumers was a touch better than expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed as high as 4.28 per cent following the reports, but it later eased to 4.25 per cent from 4.26 per cent late Wednesday. On Wall Street, Northern Trust climbed 6 per cent after reporting a stronger profit for the end of 2025 than analysts expected. CEO Michael O\u2019Grady also said that the financial services company is entering 2026 with \u201cstrong momentum across all our businesses.\u201d Procter & Gamble added 2.6 per cent after likewise delivering a better profit than analysts expected. Revenue for the company behind the Downy, Pantene and Tide brands, though, fell just shy of expectations amid what CEO Shailesh Jejurikar called a \u201cchallenging consumer and geopolitical environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShares of BitGo, a company that helps crypto businesses and traditional financial firms hold and manage digital assets, rose 2.7 per cent in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company priced its stock at $US18 per share in its initial public offering, above its earlier estimated range of $US15 to $US17. JPMorgan Chase rose 0.5 per cent after a lawsuit filed by Trump against the bank caused minor ripples for its stock. Trump accused JPMorgan Chase of closing his accounts for political reasons after he left office in 2021. They helped offset an 8.1 per cent drop for spice seller McCormick & Co., whose profit fell short of expectations. CEO Brendan Foley said it continues to face rising costs because of \u201ca shifting global trade environment.\u201d All told, the S&P 500 rose 37.73 points to 6,913.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 306.78 to 49,384.01, and the Nasdaq composite gained 211.20 to 23,436.02. In stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across Europe and Asia amid relief on Trump\u2019s walk back of tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nInvesting Team TACO cashes in as Trump folds again Elizabeth Knight Business columnist Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX returned 1.2 per cent for two of the world\u2019s bigger moves. Global markets also got support from a continued easing of long-term yields in Japan\u2019s bond market. They had spiked early in the week on worries that Japan\u2019s popular prime minister could make moves that would add heavily to the government\u2019s already big debt. But the 40-year Japanese government bond yield has come back since hitting a record and dropped below 4 per cent on Thursday after hitting 4.22 per cent on Tuesday.

Got it Share A A A\n\nIt\u2019s a year for creatively ambitious Hollywood movies backed by substantial budgets at the Academy Awards, with Sinners, One Battle After Another, Marty Supreme and Frankenstein heavily nominated early this morning. And it is also a year for ambitious non-English-language films from other parts of the world with The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value featuring among the contenders. With the nominations dominated by stories about central characters challenging power in different forms, Australia has first-time nominations for Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You), Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein) and, for best original song, Nick Cave (Train Dreams). Production designer Fiona Crombie, who has been nominated previously for The Favourite, is back for Hamnet. In raw numbers, Sinners leads the way with a record 16 nominations \u2013 boosted by the inclusion of a new Oscar for best casting. Next is One Battle with 13 nominations and Frankenstein, Marty Supreme and Sentimental Value all with nine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining them with best picture nominations are Hamnet, Bugonia, F1, The Secret Agent and Train Dreams. The good Byrne\u2019s best actress nomination is one of the feel-good stories of the nominations. While If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You was weirdly in the musical or comedy category when she won at the Golden Globes, Byrne is exceptional as a stressed-out American therapist in a tense drama with a horror edge. Nominated: Rose Byrne with rapper A$AP Rocky in If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You. AP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver two decades working in the US, she has shone in Bridesmaids and multiple Insidious, X-Men and Neighbours movies, and, on TV, in Damages, Mrs America and Physical. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Byrne told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve snuck into the back of the bus. I can\u2019t believe we got in this extraordinary group of women ... \u201cI love the Oscars. [When I was a] little girl from Sydney, Australia, I used to watch [the show]. The pageantry of it is so fun and theatrical.\u201d Related Article Oscars Rose Byrne, Jacob Elordi lead Australia\u2019s Oscars charge as Sinners makes history Elordi continues his striking Hollywood rise with a best supporting actor nomination at 28 \u2013 two years younger than boy wonder Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who is one of the favourites to win best actor for Marty Supreme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe gave heart and deep feeling to the Creature, who emerges from a demented lab and discovers the curse of eternal life, in Frankenstein. Even in the early stages, when his character was chained up and knew only the single word \u201cVictor\u201d, Elordi made him compelling to watch. Nick Cave\u2019s Train Dreams \u2013 Bryce Dessner co-wrote the music \u2013 was a haunting closer to the poetic drama Train Dreams. It will be an outsider at the Oscars, however, given it is up against Golden from the pop culture phenomenon that is KPop Demon Hunters. Without discounting the merits of One Battle After Another, Marty Supreme and Hamnet, Sinners deserves to lead the nominations. At a time when cinema fans regularly lament the lack of original films, writer-director Ryan Coogler delivered one that ambitiously fused genres, spoke about race and class in America and took creative risks. Deservedly nominated: Jacob Elordi as the creature in Frankenstein. Ken Woroner/Netflix The bad\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoel Edgerton has been close to an Oscar nomination before, for playing an FBI agent in Black Mass a decade ago. This year he absolutely deserved to be recognised for his heartbreaking performance as an early 20th century itinerant logger and railroad labourer in Train Dreams. There is so much emotion \u2013 suppressed and occasionally overflowing \u2013 in a quiet character who experiences horror, loneliness and grief but endures to finally feel like he understands life in his last years. Train Dreams is up for best picture, adapted screenplay, cinematography and original song; the Australian actor who made it so moving has sadly missed out. While there are two non-English-language films up for best picture, Sentimental Value and The Secret Agent, the Academy overlooked the best one. Jafar Panahi\u2019s It Was Just An Accident is a tense and twisting thriller, darkly comic, about the abuse of power in Iran that won the Palme d\u2019Or, the major prize, at Cannes. Nick Cave, who is nominated for best original song for Train Dreams, performing in London with the Bad Seeds. Megan Cullen\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPanahi, who had already been jailed for \u201ccreating propaganda against the system\u201d and supporting anti-government protesters, made it in secret to avoid government censorship, and his courage and craft should have been rewarded with a best director nomination as well. And how unlucky were Chase Infiniti, the breakout star as the daughter of a revolutionary in One Battle, and Paul Mescal, who played Shakespeare in Hamnet? Their categories, best actress and actor, were so competitive this time around that they missed out. Way back in 2002, when Will Smith was nominated for best actor for Ali, he told me the Academy had historically overlooked deserving African-American actors and gave Delroy Lindo from Malcolm X, Get Shorty and Cider House Rules as evidence. At 73, Lindo has finally received a nomination. He is up for best supporting actor for playing a legendary blues musician in Sinners. Should have been nominated: Joel Edgerton in Train Dreams. Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ugly Voters decided that sequels were ugly. There are no nominations for Wicked: For Good, not even for Ariana Grande\u2019s performance as Glinda, and Avatar: Fire and Ice is only up for best visual effects, which it might well win, and costume design. Ariana Grande as Glinda in Wicked: For Good. AP While Frankenstein and Sinners deserved to be up for best make-up and hairstyling, alongside the little-seen Kokuho and The Ugly Stepsister, I was never sure what to make of Dwayne Johnson\u2019s transformation into a tormented UFC fighter in The Smashing Machine. His performance was impressive, but the character\u2019s look felt awkward and forced. Still, he did not look like Dwayne Johnson, which I guess was the triumph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oscars take place on Monday, March 16, Australian time.

        "text": "\u201cYou never say never,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cI loved my time playing league when I was younger, I still love the game and love watching it. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where my career takes me. If it happens, it happens.\u201d What about the five-year offer from Rugby Australia? \u201cI\u2019m still signed to the Tahs and Rugby Australia this year. We\u2019re still working through a few things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m loving my time playing at the Tahs, but we\u2019ll get through this year and see what happens. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to [get it done early], but sometimes it\u2019s not up to you. Hopefully, it works itself out. Max Jorgensen with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii at Waratahs training in Mudgee. Credit: Amber Hooper \u201cI like to keep my cards close to my chest. Obviously, a home World Cup is massive. It doesn\u2019t come around too often. I do know to play in a home World Cup would be really cool.\u201d The addition of Crichton and Nawaqanitawase, will that be factored into your decision?\n\n\u201cAngus and Marky are two very talented athletes who have done great things in union, including \u2018Gus\u2019 at schoolboys level, and Marky with the Tahs and Wallabies,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cTo have them back in the game is exciting. They\u2019re two amazing players. You do want to play with the best players. They\u2019re elite with experience. \u2018I\u2019m loving my time playing at the Tahs, but we\u2019ll get through this year and see what happens.\u2019 Max Jorgensen on his future \u201cI want to win a Super Rugby title with the Tahs. With the Wallabies, there are Bledisloes, World Cups, even trying to win against the British and Irish Lions. They are all things that are on your bucket list when growing up. \u201cBut like I said, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nWaratahs coach Dan McKellar spoke for everyone in rugby when he said: \u201cIf we get that [deal] done sooner rather than later, everyone will sleep that little bit easier. \u201cI can understand why the Roosters, or any NRL club, would be interested. He\u2019s an elite talent. Max Jorgensen in Mudgee where the Waratahs spent a week training. Credit: Amber Hooper \u201cHopefully, he\u2019s comfortable and enjoying where he is at the moment, and he feels valued. Max loves rugby union and what the game can offer. \u201cHe will be [well] remunerated, regardless of where he plays.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be pretty confident he\u2019s enjoying the environment we have here at the Waratahs, and he\u2019ll enjoy it with the Wallabies. \u201cMax\u2019s greatest strength is his humility. He\u2019s not a self-promoter. He\u2019s incredibly humble, comes from a good family, and doesn\u2019t get ahead of himself. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it many times before when 21-year-olds all of a sudden become superstars overnight, and they can get ahead of themselves. That\u2019s certainly not the case with Max.\u201d Jorgensen was born in England, but grew up in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, playing rugby with the Balmain Wolves, and league with the Leichhardt Juniors, later switching to the Concord Wolves once the Juniors folded. He was in the Balmain Harold Matthews\u2019 team that featured Wests Tigers forward Tony Sukkar.\n\nOne of Jorgensen\u2019s earliest memories was wearing a Roosters jersey and supporting the club where his father spent two seasons and racked up 20 tries in the 1990s. Peter celebrated tries with the \u201caeroplane\u201d, which Max said he might produce this season. \u201cI\u2019ve seen videos of it \u2013 I might have to bring it out this year,\u201d he said, with a smile. Max Jorgensen playing for the Waratahs last year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI leaned on dad a lot when I was younger, and definitely when I was transitioning into professional footy. I still do now, and he\u2019ll give me pointers after each game. \u201cDad always leaned towards supporting the Roosters, and it rubbed off on me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve followed them my whole life. I did a pre-season with the club under Robbo a couple of years ago, which was also the first time I met \u2018Su\u2019 [Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii]. \u201cI loved Robbo as a coach, he\u2019s a great bloke as well and a great man.\u201d Brad Fittler is Roosters\u2019 royalty, while his son, Zach, is now with the Waratahs, and played against Jorgensen in the GPS first XV schoolboys competition. If Jorgensen switched, Fittler said there was no question about him being a success. \u201cHe could make it as fullback or five-eighth; there was a time I thought he could have been too small, but some of the best players in our comp are now small,\u201d Fittler said. \u201cHe\u2019s tough, has a great skill set, and he reads the game well.\u201d\n\nLoading The Roosters could do with a fullback or winger like Jorgensen. Fullback James Tedesco is signed until the end of next year, and although he is in the kind of form to keep playing until he is 40, the skipper cannot go on forever. Veteran winger Daniel Tupou is in the same boat, while Nawaqanitawase\u2019s exit creates another wing opening. The Roosters have also had success starting two of their great fullbacks \u2013 Anthony Minichiello and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck \u2013 on the wing before transitioning to the No. 1. Jorgensen gives little away, but there is no hint of arrogance. He is tight with Suaalii. He was genuinely unsure if he needed a shirt for this masthead\u2019s photo shoot, and politely asked if the zinc on his face would be an unwanted distraction for the photographer.",
