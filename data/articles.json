(Dominic Lorrimer)\n\n\"I said, 'Well sack me' and he said, 'I can't sack you, you are too much of a problem'.\"\n\nJoyce was asked by ABC radio's Patricia Karvelas in December if he could promise power prices would be more affordable if the Coalition won the election.\n\n\"That is asking for a hypothetical question, which I could answer for you, but I would not be telling the truth, because I don't have the facts before me,\" he responded at the time.\n\nJoyce today reaffirmed his view that power prices, particularly in regional areas, had become untenable.\n\n\"No one can dispute power prices are going through the roof, no one can dispute that the power grid is become unreliable,\" he said.\n\n\"We are pushing Australians into destitution we have no right to do that.\"\n\nJoyce said former Opposition leader Peter Dutton 'lost his mind' over his refusal to say energy prices would be lower. (James Brickwood)\n\nJoyce and fellow Nationals MP Michael McCormack today claimed they discovered they'd been axed from the shadow ministry and relegated to the backbench in a post-election reshuffle after being asked about it by reporters.\n\nThe former party rivals are now united in support over Joyce's private member pill to repeal net zero.\n\nMcCormack has joined Joyce's campaign against the Coalition-backed policy of net zero by 2050, which Joyce has described as a \"lunatic crusade\".\n\nThe Morrison government said in 2021 it had agreed to aim for net zero emissions by 2050 \ufeff, which would mean removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as what's emitted, so the net amount added is zero.\n\n\"We are trying to achieve net zero something that neither Russia, China, United States, Brazil etc are part of. You are in the minority group here,\" Joyce added.\n\nMichael McCormack and David Littleproud during Question Time at Parliament House in Canberra in 2021. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud today said net zero was an impossible task and the 2050 goal was \"tearing apart\" regional communities.\n\nREAD MORE: Child victims of human trafficking sex ring found in bunker\n\n\"I think net zero unfortunately has become something about trying to achieve the impossible rather than actually doing what's sensible, and we're bearing the burden of that,\" Littleproud told reporters today.\n\nThe Coalition and Nationals are reviewing their climate and energy policies following May's stunning election defeat.\n\n\"The last two elections we went forward with a policy supporting net zero and we have been handed our political derriere on a plate, haven't we,\" Joyce added.",

        "text": "A desire to carry on the legacy of a lifelong friend has drawn an Australian Basketball Hall of Famer to Western Australia's far north to support local children and players.\n\nA championship-winning player and coach across multiple decades in the NBL, Cal Bruton travelled to Broome, 2,000 kilometres north of Perth, to honour the work of his friend, longtime local and coach Mark Manado.\n\nMr Manado, who died late last year, was a pillar of the Broome community, a former councillor and active figure in local basketball.\n\nChildren participate in the inaugural Mark Manado Basketball Tournament. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nIn collaboration with the Broome Youth and Community Hub, Bruton helped launch the inaugural Mark Manado Tournament, an event they hoped would become an annual tradition.\n\nThe tournament brought together teams of local children and teenagers who regularly trained and played at the community centre.\n\nCoaches led a series of training sessions and skill-building drills over three days.\n\n\"Mark left a huge legacy because [there was] everyone in his classes, people, his relatives, all the young Indigenous kids that are keen to play sport,\" Bruton said.\n\n\" But he was more than that. He wanted inclusiveness \u2026 Mark would leave out no-one. \"\n\nThe tournament coincided with the opening of upgrades to the Broome Youth and Community Centres basketball courts, spearheaded by Bruton.\n\nVehicle to better futures\n\nMr Manado taught at the local TAFE and was a part of the first Broome Indigenous-majority shire council in 2011.\n\nAlongside football, basketball has provided a key outlet for children in a region where youth issues remained a significant policy challenge.\n\nMark Manado was a beloved Broome community member who died from health complications last year. (Supplied)\n\nMr Manado was a mentor in Bruton's life, showing him around the Kimberley's vast outback, leading to Bruton's active involvement in basketball clinics across the region.\n\nBruton, who is an American-born Australian former professional basketball player and coach, said his own upbringing in Brooklyn highlighted the importance the sport could play.\n\nCal Bruton commemorates his late friend through sport. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"Basketball is a sport that unites everyone and it's a tremendous vehicle towards health, employment, and further education,\" he said.\n\n\" We feel that if a kid is on the right track and playing sport in a safe environment and culture, then they can succeed at any space. \"\n\nMr Manado's granddaughter, Teahni, said she had fond memories of the pair playing basketball together, describing the sport as a big part of their life.\n\nTeahni Manado says her pop was a kind-hearted man who loved playing basketball. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"My pop was a beautiful man. He always made me smile and made me laugh,\" she said.\n\n\"We are celebrating the Mark tournament and we're celebrating my pops' legacy with all my family and friends.\"\n\nUpgrades for court\n\nThe drop-in centre has been a part of the Broome community for nearly 40 years, according to the Broome Youth and Community Hub chief executive, Melinda Phillips.\n\nThe Broome Youth and Families hub's basketball court has been upgraded. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nShe said kids had come to the centre to connect, learn and have fun after school and on weekends for decades.\n\n\"We got an email from Cal back in March and he expressed he wanted to do a tribute to his friend Mark Manado and look at opportunities at how we could uplift the centre and support the young people that come here,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\n\" That sort of steamrolled into a clinic, a tournament \u2026 which is a tribute to Mark Manado. \"\n\nShe said sporting activities had always been an important part of the service the centre tried to offer.\n\nAs part of the project, the hub's long-worn court was revitalised with fresh paint, adjustable hoops, and a new grandstand named in Mr Manado's honour.\n\nMelinda Phillips says she is thrilled with the upgrades to the drop-in centre's basketball court. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"If you feel a part of something, that belonging, it gives people, especially young people, an opportunity to not just be a part of a team, but to challenge themselves individually as well,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\n\" Sport gives anyone the chance to reach their own capacity of where they want to be. You can have fun, it can be social, it can be competitive. \"",

        "text": "Taxpayers face a potential $500 million bill to clean up aging oil and gas infrastructure left by Chevron off Western Australia's Pilbara, newly released state government documents reveal.\n\nThe oil and gas giant is preparing to decommission its WA Oil project on Barrow Island, 50 kilometres north-west of Karratha, which ceased production in May after 60 years of operation.\n\nThe process requires Chevron to cap 900 oil wells and rehabilitate areas of the island impacted by the project.\n\nThe exact cost of safely closing down the facility was previously unclear.\n\nBut documents released after a Freedom of Information request by independent energy and climate journalist Peter Milne, and seen by the ABC, indicated state and federal governments would contribute at least half a billion dollars of the estimated $2.3 billion bill.\n\nDecommissioning Chevron's WA Oil operations is expected to cost at least $2.3 billion. (Supplied: Chevron)\n\nThe growing taxpayer liability stems from a 1985 agreement allowing Chevron to be refunded royalties to cover 40 per cent of the cost of the first four years of decommissioning.\n\nSince operations began at Barrow Island in 1967, Chevron has paid more than $1 billion in royalties to the federal and WA governments, in a 75/25 per cent split.\n\nReporting prompts bureaucrats' calculations\n\nMilne's request led to the release of several 2022 emails from within WA's Department of Mines, Petroleum and Exploration (DMPE), as well as briefing notes to then-mines and petroleum minister Bill Johnston.\n\nAll of the documents have been heavily redacted.\n\nOne email revealed that total clean-up and rehabilitation costs at Barrow Island were expected to surpass $2.3 billion.\n\nBut a separate email showed the department had not calculated how much of that WA would have to pay, and only made efforts to do so after being alerted to the situation by media reports.\n\nA 1985 agreement allows Chevron to access refunded state and federal royalties. (ABC News: Ashleigh Davis)\n\nIn 2022, Milne reported that an internal Chevron document put the cost of the first four years of the Barrow Island clean-up \u2014 which the company is eligible to be compensated for \u2014 at $1.3 billion.\n\nIt is this figure that the department referenced in the email.\n\n\"[The department] intends to approach Chevron directly to request cost estimates,\" the email read.\n\n\"Until we are able to glean such details, we only have what has been reported in the media.\n\n\"Based on that, the 'refund' from the State govt is: $1.29 billion x 0.4 x 0.25 = $129 million.\"\n\nUnder the 75/25 split between the federal and state governments spelled out in the 1985 agreement, the Commonwealth would be required to refund $387 million to Chevron.\n\nChevron says the company and its partners will pay the majority of decommissioning costs. (Supplied: Chevron)\n\nShadow Mines and Petroleum Minister Shane Love has questioned the fairness of the deal.\n\n\"You'd have to question the intergenerational fairness of a government of the day taking the royalties and then asking the generation of the future to pay for the share of the cost of the rehabilitation,\" Mr Love said.\n\nThe criticism was echoed by progressive think tank The Australia Institute.\n\nPrincipal advisor Mark Ogge said it was an outrage Chevron could access state and federal funding to meet its environmental liabilities.\n\n\"It's a massive giveaway of Australian taxpayers' money to a company that's already on an unbelievably good deal,\" Mr Ogge said.\n\n\" We just can't understand how our governments just aren't acting in our interests. \"\n\nCost to taxpayers still not known\n\nA Department of Mines, Petroleum and Exploration spokesperson said the department still did not know the total cost the state government may need to pay in the decommissioning process.\n\n\n\n\"The total amount of any potential refund will not be known until West Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd submits its final royalty returns and the department has reviewed and audited the company\u2019s rehabilitation and decommissioning costs,\" the statement read.\n\nChevron declined to be interviewed but provided a statement.\n\nChevron's Gorgon Project continues to operate on Barrow Island. (Supplied: Chevron)\n\n\"Under relevant state legislation, which has been in place for the past four decades, costs for eligible WA Oil decommissioning activities can be partially refunded from previously paid royalties,\" the statement read.\n\n\"While costs may be partially refunded, Chevron Australian and its WA Oil joint venture partners will continue to pay the vast majority of the decommissioning costs, given the strict rules outlined in the legislation.\n\n\"We will continue to engage with state and federal governments in relation to the WA Oil decommissioning project and the administration of the royalty regime.\"",

This is what happens,'\" Ms Yuen said.\n\n\"No, that's not a decent enough excuse anymore.\"\n\nNeed for infrastructure\n\nThe City of Busselton is home to more than 40,000 people, according to the 2021 census, and is considered one of the fastest growing regional cities in WA.\n\nBusselton Mayor Phill Cronin said phone and internet coverage had diminished in the area over the past five years, which he believed was due to inadequate telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nPhill Cronin says connectivity issues in the area are concerning. (Supplied: Phill Cronin)\n\n\"I've heard sometimes they [telecommunications companies] are unable to put towers up because they can't get the power to the towers,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a whole-of-infrastructure issue that really does need to be addressed.\"\n\nCr Cronin said the council had received a number of reports from concerned residents about the issue.\n\n\"We've seen unfortunately during some recent fires where one of the towers was down, the DFES emergency warnings weren't being sent out and people weren't even able to make triple-0 calls,\" he said.\n\n\"That is a major concern for our community.\"\n\nCouncils push for federal assistance for mobile black spots Photo shows A grey-haired, bearded man sits at an office desk.

        "text": "Norwegian cyclist Tobias Johannessen has collapsed at the finish line atop Mont Ventoux after stage 16 of the Tour de France.\n\nJohannessen was taken to hospital after being given oxygen by a race doctor immediately after finishing the stage, where he at times looked in physical pain, clutching at his stomach and chest.\n\nJohannessen retained eighth place in the general classifications despite his struggles on the stage, won by Frenchman Valentin Paret-Peintre.\n\nTobias Johannessen said he struggled with his breathing but was hopeful of returning for stage 17. (Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\nJohannessen's Uno-X team said he \"suffered some right-sided upper abdominal pain during the final climb today\" before being taken to \"local hospital for further checks\".\n\nHe later returned to the team hotel, telling Norwegian media he struggled with his stomach and hyperventilation during the stage but had been given the all clear after tests at the hospital.\n\n\"When I crossed the finish line, I just had to lie on my back to catch my breath,\" he told TV2, adding a decision was still to be made about whether he would continue in the race.\n\n\" We will do another round of tests tomorrow, but I am positive. Everything we have done looks very good \u2026 so we will most likely be ready again tomorrow. \"\n\nMeanwhile, Soudal-Quick Step rider Paret-Peintre gave France its first win of this year's Tour by edging out Ireland's Ben Healy in a heart-pounding sprint finale on the Giant of Provence.\n\n\"I honestly didn't believe it,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought [leader Tadej] Poga\u010dar would go for victory today. But when we built a real gap, I told myself, 'You can't let a win on Mont Ventoux slip through your fingers.'\"\n\nSeven riders surged ahead from an early breakaway, carving out a healthy 6 minute and 30 second buffer as they reached the base of the climb.\n\nSpanish climber Enric Mas led the charge, attacking solo 14.2 kilometres from the summit as Paret-Peintre, Healy and Colombia's Santiago Buitrago gave chase.\n\nBelgian Ilan Van Wilder fought his way back to the group and dug deep for teammate Paret-Peintre to keep the Poga\u010dar-Jonas Vingegaard threat at bay.\n\nThe Tour de France climb with a deadly history Photo shows Tadej Poga\u010dar rides up a mountain in the yellow jersey The ascent to hell on the punishing slopes of Mont Ventoux is one of the Tour de France's most formidable and iconic theatres and has a history dotted with drama and tragedy.\n\nVingegaard had attacked a handful of times, the first attempt coming 9 kilometres from the top, but could not shake off Poga\u010dar.\n\nWith 400 metres to go and the gradient spiking to a lung-scorching 10 per cent, Healy launched his sprint but Paret-Peintre clung to his wheel.\n\nIn the final metres, he surged past, claiming not just a stage win, but also a place in French cycling folklore.\n\nHe was only the fifth Frenchman to conquer the Ventoux, the mountain that claimed the life of Tom Simpson, who died in hospital after collapsing in the finale of the ascent in 1967.\n\nPoga\u010dar remained unshakable in yellow, fending off Vingegaard on the brutal 21.5km ascent averaging 7.5 per cent.\n\nDefending champion Poga\u010dar clawed two more seconds from his Danish rival in a final surge to extend his overall lead to 4:15 after setting the record for the climb, riding up in 54:41\u2014 1:10 faster than the previous best mark set by Spain's Iban Mayo in 2004.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe Slovenian also beat the fastest time from the Saint-Esteve bend, where the toughest section starts by clocking 44:48. The previous record was held by the late Marco Pantani (46:00).\n\n\"I had a bad day in 2021 on the Ventoux. Today was the opposite. I had good legs. I enjoyed myself,\" Poga\u010dar, chasing a fourth Tour title, said.\n\n\"We will try to go for another stage win. He [Vingegaard] attacked a lot of times but I knew that I could follow the wheel.\"\n\nVingegaard suffered a brief crash after the line but said his performance gave him confidence that he was still in contention for a third title.\n\n\"How I felt good today gives me motivation,\" he said.\n\n\"I will keep trying.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "For some parents, child care drop-off may create unsettling or anxious feelings.\n\nWill there be enough educators? Who is that new casual carer?\n\nChildcare leaders say they understand the distress parents are experiencing after allegations of physical abuse and sexual abuse in childcare centres in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nChildren are being exposed to childcare staff who lack basic training, an ABC investigation has revealed, and multiple states have committed to sector-wide reforms.\n\nChildcare workers say some centres are doing their best to ensure child safety. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)\n\nSydney educator and childcare centre assistant director Arianne, who asked for her surname not to be used, said it was difficult for parents to trust the childcare environment.\n\n\"If I was a parent, I'd be making sure that all rooms were completely open,\" she said.\n\n\"How is the turnover of staff? Do the fees that you pay go back into your centre? Just asking loads and loads of questions.\"\n\nDiscrepancies across centres\n\nArianne said her centre went beyond standardised ratios and had two educators for every four to five children, all staff completed a child protection course, and a thorough staff vetting process was in place, but she saw concerning practices at other centres.\n\nInadequate staffing ratios are highlighted as a major child care concern. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nShe remembered having to care for 16 children under the age of two alone and being told not to allow any children to play outside all day while working at large services that wanted to get \"as many children in as possible\".\n\n\"They'll hire anyone,\" Arianne said.\n\n\"They don't do their due diligence because they just don't care, as long as there's 'under the roof' ratio.\"\n\nA United Workers Union survey of 2,100 childcare workers revealed 83 per cent of workers reported centres used a common staffing loophole called the \"under the roof\" ratio, which counted all workers in a centre, rather than numbers in individual rooms.\n\nIt is legal under the National Quality Framework.\n\nMinimum standards insufficient, educators say\n\nOwner and director of Jane's Place Early Learning Centre in central Sydney, Jane Zarfati, said ensuring child safety required more than complying with minimum childcare regulations.\n\nMinister slams Working with Children Check reforms Photo shows A close up of a man wearing a suit speaking. Reforms that would standardise Working with Children Checks across the country \"can't happen soon enough\", the federal education minister says, in the wake of allegations of child sexual abuse at a Victorian childcare centre.\n\nShe said vetting staff and daily onsite management were key.\n\n\"We have different processes in regards to supervision, so we don't have just one staff member with a child at any time,\" she said.\n\n\"If there are children using the bathrooms, for example, there's always someone supervising, but there will also be someone in eyeshot as well.\"\n\nMs Zarfati said she conducted police checks and reference checks, as well as working with children checks when hiring staff, and ensured applicants had proper and up-to-date qualifications.\n\nThe centre also uses CCTV throughout, which is one of the key considerations in proposed reforms to the childcare sector.\n\nChildcare workers say there are discrepancies in standards across centres. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nBut Ms Zarfati said not every centre followed these procedures.\n\n\"Sometimes these checks and balances aren't done, and then the regulatory bodies aren't manned enough \u2026 to pull up things that aren't being done correctly or have been overlooked,\" she said.\n\nA NSW Early Childhood Education and Care Regulatory Authority spokesperson said it thoroughly investigated all allegations or complaints and conducted \"more visits to services than any other regulatory authority across the country\", but it knew \"more needs to be done\".\n\nUnderstaffing concerns\n\nEducator Samantha, whose surname has been withheld for legal reasons, said she was concerned about the use of the \"under the roof\" ratio loophole in centres she had worked at in NSW, which meant some rooms were understaffed.\n\nBoth were part of Affinity Education Group, which has more than 250 centres in Australia and has been in the news after staff at different centres in Queensland, NSW and Victoria were charged with offences against children in unrelated incidents.\n\nNSW's childcare regulator says it knows \"more needs to be done\". (ABC News: Stephanie Zillman)\n\n\"We were also under pressure to not turn children away when they were dropped off in the morning,\" Samantha said.\n\nShe said even if the baby room had the minimum national requirement of two educators to eight babies, she felt \"it wasn't best practice\".\n\n\"That national regulation needs to change,\" Samantha said, referring to the National Quality Framework.\n\nEducators say parents are concerned about leaving their children with unfamiliar staff. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)\n\nSamantha said she saw firsthand how the centre handled the regulator's assessment and ratings, by \"back loading\" with \"a lot of resources and educators that no-one knows\".\n\nAffinity Education Group said in a statement that while it used the industry practice of \"under the roof\" ratios, it complied with and often exceeded the government's mandated educator-to-child ratio requirements.\n\nIt said it took compliance issues seriously, was committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by regulatory bodies, and was working to strengthen safety.\n\nTips for parents\n\nSo, how can parents be reassured that their childcare centre is not just compliant, but taking child safety seriously?\n\nCasual educator agency Talent Now founder and chief executive Liddy Korner said staff consistency was important, and managers should check that educators had the correct qualifications.\n\nMs Korner said good operators did not rely on the \"under the roof\" ratio requirement and always worked above minimum ratios, even the national requirement of one educator to four babies.\n\n\"There should always be a minimum of two, and that shouldn't be hard to change,\" she said.\n\nEarly Childhood Education Minister Jess Walsh said in a statement it was concerning that some educators suggested their providers were not meeting National Quality Framework staff ratios.\n\nShe said those ratios were \"vital for keeping children safe and providing quality early education\".\n\nMs Walsh said the government was introducing legislation to cut Commonwealth funding to providers who put profit over child safety, and it was holding an urgent education ministers' meeting next month to create a nationwide educator register.\n\nReporter Katherine Gregory sends her children to Jane's Place Early Learning Centre.",

He was the show's punchline.\n\nCan I get a quick welfare check? Sharon?\n\nThe Osbournes set Ozzy's public image for a younger generation: the aging rocker whose penchant for drugs and booze had left its mark.\n\nBecause Ozzy's whole persona was cheating death, it's weird to know that he is, in the end, just like the rest of us: mortal.\n\nBefore the Kardashians, there were the Osbournes\n\nThe Osbournes was based in reality but it exaggerated what took place to make it more funny, according to Jeff Stilson, a former late-night comedy writer who worked as a co-executive producer on the show.\n\nOzzy Osbourne dies aged 76 Photo shows close up of man with long black hair and a pair or purple-shaded glasses on Described as one of the founders of heavy metal music, John Michael Osbourne was known for his incredible voice and charisma.\n\n\"We are often compared to Survivor and Big Brother, but we are not like those shows,\" he told RN Breakfast in 2002.\n\n\"That's the family, but for every 500 minutes of footage that we shoot, we use one minute.\n\n\"We are a comedy \u2026 We are structuring our show so it feels more like a sitcom.\"\n\nOzzy Osbourne with his kids, Jack and Kellie, who starred alongside him in The Osbournes. (Reuters: Alessia Pierdomenico/file)\n\nThe show \u2014 a hit for Network Ten at the time \u2014 was an early version of a format that would become hugely popular in the following years.\n\nThis kind of not-quite-reality TV, filmed inside a family unit and heavily edited, became the format for the various Housewives seasons and Keeping Up With The Kardashians, among others.\n\nAnd just like the Kardashians used their TV show to grow their brand and sell their own merchandise, The Osbournes helped Ozzy and his family re-energise the singer's celebrity for a younger generation unfamiliar with Black Sabbath.\n\n\"We broadened our audience by millions,\" he said in 2002.\n\nThe series went on to win an Emmy for outstanding reality program that year.\n\nIn the show, Ozzy would swear and argue and complain, but his manner was always tinged with innocence.\n\nThe Prince of Darkness ultimately seemed like a good husband and father.\n\nA classic rock 'n' roll frontman\n\nWhat's interesting about that later-in-life view of Ozzy was that it supplanted the idea of Ozzy the musician.\n\nThe Birmingham-born untrained singer had a voice that fit the glam rock genre he grew up in. It was theatrical, like he was the evil character in a Broadway production.\n\nOzzy Osbourne during a press conference in Australia in 1973. (ABC)\n\nFirst with Black Sabbath and later as a solo artist, Ozzy was a rock 'n' roll frontman at a time when the rock 'n' roll frontman was a must.\n\nEvery long-haired, tight-panted rock act worth their elaborate rider \u2014 Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper \u2014 had a point man (and it was always a man) whose job was as much to throw around his sex appeal as hold a note.\n\nBut where Zeppelin's Robert Plant stood out for his tenor, Ozzy had not just a great voice but character and a backstory.\n\nThis was the working-class troublemaker who got kicked out of Black Sabbath for being a drug addict \u2014 quite a feat \u2014 and who famously bit the head off a dead bat.\n\nHis pop cultural cache was off the charts.\n\nHe found his way onto The Simpsons, Wayne's World and elsewhere. Late in life, as it was revealed he was battling Parkinson's, he collaborated with Post Malone, a legend among people under 25.\n\nThe two Ozzys\n\nWhich version of Ozzy will prevail?\n\nBlack Sabbath were pioneers of hard rock. (Wikipedia Commons)\n\nThe menacing singer of a pioneering hard rock band who commanded huge crowds across a decades-long career?\n\nOr the big, befuddled family man, roaming around his mansion swearing at his dogs for shitting on the carpet?\n\nThe answer is both.\n\nWe all contain multitudes, and this dichotomy was Ozzy's.\n\nHe'll be remembered differently by several different generations, and that's almost the definition of a pop cultural icon.",

        "text": "As parliament returns this week for the first time since the election, the top item of business for Labor is its election promise to reduce student loans by 20 per cent.\n\nLegislation will be introduced on Wednesday and is likely to become law soon after, with both the Coalition and the Greens appearing likely to support it.\n\nIt means about 3 million Australians will see an automatic adjustment applied to their loans later this year, and also see changes to the repayment rules. Here's how it works.\n\nThe current HELP system\n\nThe reduction applies to the various student loans offered by the federal government under the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP).\n\nThat includes HECS-HELP for university degrees (commonly shortened to HECS), but also FEE-HELP, VET and apprenticeship loans, and a variety of others.\n\nThese are called \"income-contingent\" loans because you are only required to repay them if you earn more than a certain threshold.\n\nThere is no interest on the loans, but the outstanding amount is indexed every year. Previously, it was indexed to inflation, but under a law passed in the last term it is now whichever is lower of inflation or wages.\n\nHow will the 20 per cent HECS reduction be applied?\n\nLabor's proposal is to apply a one-off, 20 per cent reduction to all outstanding loans.\n\nIf the legislation is passed, the ATO will apply this reduction automatically, based on the value of your loan on June 1, 2025.\n\nIndexation, which this year is 3.2 per cent, will be recalculated to apply to the reduced loan.\n\nLoans for any course with a census date before June 1 will count, even if they haven't shown up on your ATO account.\n\nAnd if you happen to have repaid the last of your loan since 1 June, you may get a refund.\n\nOn the other hand, if you had already paid off your loan by June 1, there will be no refund and these changes do not benefit you.\n\nHow will HECS repayments change?\n\nThe other major change in Labor's proposal is to the rules for repaying your debt.\n\nFirst, the income threshold above which you are required to make a repayment will increase from $54,435 to $67,000.\n\nSecond, the way the threshold works will change.\n\nCurrently, if you earn more than the threshold, you must provide a certain percentage of your entire income to pay down the debt.\n\nSo if you earn $70,000 next year, the current system would require you to pay back 2.5 per cent of $70,000 \u2014 or $1,750.\n\nUnder Labor's proposal, you would instead pay only a higher percentage (15 per cent) but only on $3,000, the portion of your income above the threshold \u2014 a total of $450.\n\nThe exact rates will be included in the legislation, but an online calculator from the department appears to suggest a flat 15 per cent rate will apply up to $125,000 and then a slightly higher rate beyond that, while anyone earning more than $180,000 will have the same repayments as under the old system.\n\nThese changes would take effect for the current financial year (2025-26).\n\nWill the bill pass?\n\nLabor has a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives, so will have no trouble passing the bill through that house.\n\nIn the Senate, it requires the support of either the Coalition or the Greens. The Coalition was opposed to the proposal prior to the election. However, it has sent strong signals that it will now support it.\n\nEven if the Coalition does not support it, the Greens are supportive of the general principle so are unlikely to vote against it, although they will propose amendments, seeking to go further by stopping indexation entirely.",

In 2023, ASFA reported that the median super balance for women was about 25 per cent lower than for men.\n\nJust over 30 per cent of retired women rely on their partner's income to meet their living costs, compared to just 8 per cent of retired men.\n\nASFA also recommends that a single person who owns their own home needs $33,386 a year to maintain a modest lifestyle during retirement, while a couple requires $48,184 a year.\n\nA renter who is single needs $46,663 a year, while a couple needs $64,259.\n\nA good retirement can depend on a variety of things, including access to housing. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nWhat does modest mean? According to ASFA, it includes basic private insurance, an older car, infrequent leisure activities, budget haircuts, limited outings at inexpensive restaurants and keeping a close eye on utility costs.\n\n\"It's possible to fund retirement through part age pension and part your own money,\" Mr Wrigley says.\n\nBut it is \"far more challenging\" if you don't own your own home and must pay rent.\n\n\"That throws a different set of complications that need to be dealt with,\" he says.\n\n'Keeping well and keeping social'\n\nExercise and a sensible diet are essential for good health but, according to Nancy Pachana, the co-director at the Ageing Mind Initiative at the University of Queensland, paying attention to our mental health and social network is just as vital to achieving a good retirement.\n\nJoanne Earl says you should allow yourself the luxury of easing into retirement. (Supplied)\n\n\"Not having a good social network will have a greater impact on your health, in many cases, than not exercising. And people don't realise this,\" Professor Pachana says.\n\n\"Some people who do experience social isolation are at greater risk of physical decline and a greater risk for dementia.\"\n\nJoanne Earl is an organisational psychologist from Macquarie University who specialises in retirement planning. She says being in control is key.\n\n\"A lot of people will just be focused on how much money they've got, but they need a wider lens to think about not just the money, but what they're going to be doing after they retire,\" she says.\n\n\"The two key things are keeping well and keeping social, [and also] recognising it doesn't have to be all or nothing.\"\n\nShe says people can choose to retire in their own time.\n\n\"Allow yourself the luxury of just easing into it, rather than it being a real sort of shock to the system.\"\n\nGreg Noonan retired earlier this year at the age of 56.\n\nGreg Noonan stopped working in January of this year and recently enjoyed his 100th day of retirement.

        "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe menus are printed and ready for 24 York\u2019s first day of service \u2013 but whether diners will need them is another story. The latest opening from Hunter St. Hospitality, the group behind Rockpool Bar & Grill, Spice Temple and The Collective, sticks to a tight format: with just one main course, one side and one dessert. The star of the show is the classic French bistro dish of steak frites, with chef Santi Aristizabal using the same scotch fillet cut from Gippsland that he has on the menu at sister restaurant Rockpool Bar & Grill in Melbourne. The steak frites at 24 York is made with O\u2019Connor scotch fillet and comes with a choice of four sauces. When you offer just one steak, serious consideration is invested in its selection. The trio of culinary directors at Hunter St. Hospitality, chefs Aristizabal, Andy Evans and Shimpei Hatanaka, first had to eliminate other cuts such as hanger, skirt and sirloin before deciding on scotch fillet for a range of reasons, including fat content, chewiness, mouth feel and taste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe steaks were lined up in a blind tasting of scotch fillet from 12 suppliers. Aristizabal, who oversees all three Rockpools in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, said at $48 (with chips), the 220-gram scotch fillet from Gippsland producer O\u2019Connor is good value. \u201cAt Rockpool in Melbourne you pay $95 for 400g on the bone, which is around 350g bone off. The steak at 24 York is only one marble score lower [than Rockpool].\u201d Diners will still have some decisions to make. The steak can be cooked two ways \u2013 medium or well done \u2013 and comes with a choice of four sauces: peppercorn, mushroom, chimichurri or umami butter infused with kombu, eschalot, garlic and lemon. Hunter St. Hospitality\u2019s culinary directors Andy Evans, Santi Aristizabal and Shimpei Hatanaka will oversee 24 York when it opens in July. Steven Woodburn To achieve a rosy pink centre, the fillets are seared on a very hot grill for two to three minutes, rested, then returned to the grill for a final char, before being seasoned with Murray River salt and served pre-cut in thick slices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTucker doesn\u2019t hide from the fact 24 York\u2019s steak frites approach takes inspiration from Le Relais de l\u2019Entrecote in France, which has successfully leant on steak and chips for more than half a century. He says customers increasingly appreciate venues that do a single thing well, but said critical mass is needed for the concept. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done this in Surry Hills,\u201d Tucker said. With Rockpool and The Cut in its portfolio, Tucker is confident his group has the chops in the steak department. He said the decision to include chips was easy: \u201cThe one thing that always ends up on every table [that orders steak] is chips.\u201d The fries fall somewhere between a standard cut chip and a French fry, and like those at Olympic Meats in Marrickville and Rosie\u2019s in Coledale, they\u2019re cooked in beef tallow for a richer, meatier flavour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe single side dish is a simple green salad made with seasonal leaves and a mustard dressing. Drinks are equally tight and affordable. There are four house wines \u2013 two reds and two whites, priced from $12-$13 by the glass or $39-$45 by the bottle. Asahi, Resch\u2019s and Guinness are on tap, while the cocktail selection consists of six classics, including a martini, negroni and old fashioned \u2013 all priced at $18. The opening of 24 York also signals a shift in strategy for Hunter St. Hospitality. The venue has opened in the former home of The Bavarian, which the group decided to close after operating at the York Street site for the past 14 years to focus on \u201cunique venues\u201d rather than chains. \u201cThe area\u2019s changed,\u201d Hunter St. Hospitality chief executive Frank Tucker said. That change is reflected in the restaurant\u2019s more refined fit-out, which is elegant without being overdone. The 200-seat restaurant nods to the New York bistro style with dark timber finishes, globe pendant lights and intimate booths framed by short sheer shop-curtains. And the dessert? It\u2019s a mini New York cheesecake with fresh raspberries and a quenelle of vanilla ice cream.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Geoff Hutchison has officially entered the harrumph zone. Change is everywhere. His waning status. His ageing body. This whole shot-to-hell world. Whether on ubiquitous screens or the drive to the supermarket, stupidity and inconvenience conspire to exasperate him. His mission now: How Not to Become a Grumpy Old Bugger. \u201cI genuinely think I\u2019m a better person for having written it,\u201d the former ABC radio presenter says of his first book, subtitled A bloke\u2019s guide to living a better life. \u201cI\u2019ve had cause at times to remind myself, if I\u2019m going to tell other people how they should live their lives, I\u2019ve got to respond to that. I\u2019ve got to take this stuff seriously.\u201d After 40 years as a journalist, not least with Foreign Correspondent and 7.30, he knows serious. But it was his last 16 in talkback on ABC Perth that gave him the necessary tone for a book addressing the minefield of male discontent: rigorous enquiry, sure, but with a lightness of touch that invites leaning in. \u201cI wanted to hit blokes between the eyes on a couple of things, but I also know they will put the book down and never read another paragraph if I can\u2019t win them over to the conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough I still think their partners might read bits of it out loud to them in bed. That would make me happy too.\u201d In terms of inspiration, he recalls one beacon of grump from early in his talkback career: February 13, 2008, the day new PM Kevin Rudd apologised to the Stolen Generations. \u201cI reckon the first six callers were blokes, and they were all saying, \u2018I don\u2019t see that I should have to apologise for anything\u2019. I didn\u2019t say it on air but I thought, \u2018Oh my god, how can these blokes be such bastards?\u2019 \u201cBack then I took it personally. I don\u2019t now. I would now want to say to those blokes: \u2018This isn\u2019t about you. Not everything that happens in the world is about you.\u2019 That whole \u2018Harrumph, well I don\u2019t like it\u2019 \u2013 I want to convince them to just let some things go.\u201d Hutchison\u2019s book is not interested in culture wars. He isn\u2019t out to debate pronouns or cancel culture. What he\u2019s describing is something quieter and more insidious: a kind of emotional shrinkage, a stubborn stand-off with acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou raise the kids, the job ends, and you become a little less interesting to everyone. That\u2019s the bit no one tells you,\u201d he says, with the fresh insight of the recent retiree. \u201cAnd if you were defined by that role\u201d \u2013 the job, the dad, the problem-solver \u2013 \u201cI think you\u2019re very vulnerable to sadness. And loneliness.\u201d Hutchison spent the last 16 years working at ABC radio, where many of his callers helped inspire his book. The grim end of male sadness is devastating. In Australia, Hutchison discovered, 86 men call an ambulance every day with thoughts of suicide. In 2023 alone, 64 women were killed in acts of male violence. But he doesn\u2019t have to consult experts and statistics to see the darkness festering in blokes\u2019 heads. He recalls stumbling on a social media chat sharing the praises of Italian restaurants. \u201cEvery positive comment came from a woman. Every negative and unnecessary one came from a bloke. And I\u2019m just thinking, who are you? What are you doing, sitting at a keyboard, hating everything? Is there any pleasure in that?\u201d Then there was a bloke named Ian, compelled to comment under an exultant photo of three young footy players with hands casually resting on each other\u2019s knees. \u201cBack when I played footy,\u201d Ian said, \u201cwe would get the shit kicked out of us for posing like that.\u201d TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO GEOFF HUTCHISON Worst habit? It used to be celebrating cynicism. But after hearing Billy Bragg declare that \u201ccynicism is the enemy of hope\u201d, I am now determinedly of the same opinion. Greatest fear? I don\u2019t like them Fascists very much. Indeed, anyone who seeks political advantage by using fear to target and blame \u201cothers\u201d. And I\u2019m wary of anyone who thinks the concept of Prosperity Theology is endorsed by a greater power. The line that stayed with you? \u201dLove this life, don\u2019t wait \u2019til the next one comes\u201d \u2013 Neil Finn. Biggest regret? A kitchen accident that left my young son only partially sighted. I had my back turned as he tried to open a bag of apples with scissors. And yes, it was as awful as it sounds. I\u2019ve written about it for the first time in my book in the chapter titled Regret. Favourite book? Richard Ford\u2019s The Sportswriter (1986). I was a young version of one at the time. The artwork/song you wish was yours? The Portrait of the Journalist Sylvia von Harden by the German painter Otto Dix. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? London in the mid \u201960s please, with plenty of money in my pocket. And if you could get me into the Marquee Club to see \u2026 oh I dunno, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix that would be splendid. \u201cThat bloke is just curating a museum of dickheadedness,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cIt\u2019s awful, and I bet it\u2019s making him sick. I bet his wife doesn\u2019t like him much. And I bet his son doesn\u2019t come home to watch footy on Friday nights because he can\u2019t bear to hear Dad talk about their haircuts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat author doesn\u2019t exempt himself. He recounts one episode of fuming at an umpire\u2019s call that his daughter, gently, had to tell him was pathetic. He talks about making his mates laugh by impersonating \u201csome dickhead\u201d at the pub. \u201cI find that kind of cynicism less funny now. When blokes shrink into that tight, narrow worldview, they must be awful to live with.\u201d He owns that too. Post-ABC, he assumed more time with his wife, Philippa. But her career as a documentary maker is firing. \u201cShe\u2019s about to fly to the UK for three weeks of interviews. So I had to remind myself: you don\u2019t need to be at the centre of everything. You can swan around on the edges. Pick and choose how you want to engage. Just make sure you do.\u201d The active pursuit of engagement is a theme of Hutchison\u2019s book. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got male friends, place some value on that friendship. Whatever the next five, 10, 20 years look like \u2013 and they might be terrific, or they might be absolutely shithouse \u2013 you want to have people to talk to about it.\u201d That refusal to disappear, to keep showing up, runs through the people he interviews. There\u2019s social researcher and psychologist Hugh Mackay, still sharp and empathetic at 86. Alex Pearce, the Fremantle Dockers\u2019 captain is emotionally open in a way Hutchison finds quietly radical. Through his son he meets a trans woman named Gemma, whose calm presence contrasts powerfully with the rage of anonymous detractors. Two GPs talk bluntly about ageing bodies behind pseudonyms designed to tickle sci-fi-nerds: Peter Venkman and Leonard McCoy. At both ends, it\u2019s Hutchison\u2019s late father who anchors the book. The man who blithely proclaimed his unhappiness as a fact of life when Geoff was a boy \u201cused to come home from the Italian Club in Pickering Brook and say, \u2018God, people are stupid\u2019. I used to think, \u2018Is it just the gang you\u2019re hangin\u2019 out with Dad?\u2019 I\u2019ve got to believe not everyone is quite so venal or miserable.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "GM says it believes it can eventually offset about a third of the $US4 billion to $US5 billion cost of the tariffs this year by cutting costs and shifting some production to the US. That suggests the ongoing cost of the tariffs in the near term will be more than $US3.3 billion a year, though GM executives hope that trade deals with South Korea, Mexico and Canada \u2013 where most of its imported cars are sourced \u2013 may reduce that cost. As this quarterly earnings season in the US continues, commentaries from trade-exposed US companies will be pored over for references to the tariffs and how the companies are responding to them. GM chief Mary Barra. There is more pain coming for the car giant. Credit: Bloomberg Last week\u2019s June inflation data showed that in sectors directly exposed to tariffs \u2013 sectors such as fresh fruit and vegetables, household appliances, furniture, toys, clothing and sporting goods \u2013 prices are rising. The cost of the tariffs in those sectors is being passed onto customers and is affecting the inflation rate.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of inventory loading occurring in the US to get ahead of the tariffs, so their impact on the inflation rate and/or companies\u2019 profits should progressively increase as those pre-tariff stocks run down. Loading Some companies, of course, benefit from the protection provided by tariffs, which shield them to some degree from competition from imports, and where the increased cost of imports provides cover for domestic firms to raise their own prices. The US steel industry, with aluminium, was one of the earliest beneficiaries of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium imports in February and then doubled the rate, to 50 per cent, last month. About 23 per cent of the steel supply in the US is imported, with the rest produced domestically by steelmakers that are regarded as the world\u2019s most expensive producers.\n\nTheir response to Trump\u2019s tariffs has, predictably, been opportunistic. They\u2019ve raised their prices, which are up about 16 per cent this year. That\u2019s history repeating. In 2018, during Trump\u2019s initial trade war with China, he imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel imports, and the US steelmakers responded by lifting their prices by about 10 per cent, which added about $US2.5 billion to their profits. The 2018 experience shows that companies also improved their capacity utilisation and added investment and jobs \u2013 but the impact was relatively short-lived, and the costs in jobs and lost earnings to steel-consuming industries were multiples of the benefits created for the steel producers. Not only is the duty on steel today double what it was in 2018, but it applies more broadly, not just to imported steel but also to imports of steel \u201cderivatives\u201d, or products where steel is a major component.\n\nThe impact on the tariff on steel \u2013 and similar tariffs on aluminium and copper \u2013 will percolate through the US manufacturing sector, with a particular impact on an auto industry that is also subject to its own tariffs. If Trump follows through with his threatened 50 per cent tariff on all imports from Brazil (unless Brazilian authorities drop their prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro for an alleged attempted coup), the tariffs\u2019 impact on the cost of steel would be exacerbated. Brazil is a major supplier of raw materials to the sector. At some point, probably not too far into the distant future, GM and other US manufacturers will be overwhelmed by the cost increases flowing from the barrage of tariffs on auto and auto part imports and on their raw materials and be unable to absorb them without passing on a substantial proportion to customers. That is when their full effects on the inflation rate will start to show up. The \u201cTrump effect\u201d on the auto industry isn\u2019t confined to tariffs.\n\nHis aversion to electric vehicles and climate-related initiatives and his assault on the Biden administration\u2019s subsidies and incentives for carbon emission reductions and green energy, includes the withdrawal of subsidies for EV purchases and tax credits for emissions reductions. That will hit Tesla, which has relied on the sale of the regulatory credits for its profitability \u2013 it would be loss-making without them \u2013 hardest. While Trump keeps claiming that the US is collecting massive amounts of tariff revenue from other countries\u2019 exporters, the GM experience underscores what almost everyone else has always understood. It might, in the near term, help other US EV manufacturers, even GM \u2013 the second-largest US domestic manufacturer of EVs \u2013 which have had to buy the credits to offset the emissions from their larger internal combustion vehicle production. What it and, thanks to tariff and non-tariff barriers, the near-total absence of competition from imported EVs will do, however, is drive up the cost of domestically produced EVs, reduce their sales volumes and undermine the scale efficiencies that might lead to EV profitability.",

A host of countries occupy the third and fourth placings, while New Zealand is in fifth spot, along with Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most notable changes have been the United Kingdom and United States.\n\n\n\nBoth were once at the top of the index, with the UK ranking first in 2015 and the US in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the UK sits in sixth place and the US has slipped to 10th, marking a continued downward trend for both countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US is now close to falling out of the top 10 for the first time since the index began nearly 20 years ago.\n\n\n\nAustralia has dipped in the rankings and now sits with Malta, Czechia, Hungary and Poland.

The gap between the most and least mobile passports remains wide and reflects broader global inequalities in access and opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Henley & Partners chair Dr Christian H.

        "text": "Valentin Paret-Peintre became the first French winner on this year's Tour de France as he edged an enthralling stage 16 on Tuesday, pipping Ireland's Ben Healy atop the mythical 1910m altitude Mont Ventoux summit finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind them, Jonas Vingegaard attacked overall leader Tadej Poga\u010dar relentlessly, but the defending champion tracked the Dane all the way up the 15km ascent to extend his lead by two seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailing by four minutes and 13 seconds at the start of this stage, Vingegaard attacked with 9km to climb on Mont Ventoux, whose upper reaches resemble a lunar landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want to push too hard and then let him have me on a counter-attack. I kept my rhythm as much as I could,\" said Poga\u010dar, who has been fighting off a cold this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He attacked many times, but I just tried to hold his wheel.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVingegaard was knocked off his bike by a motorbike after the finish line but remained unhurt, remounting to congratulate Poga\u010dar on another fine battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He seemed okay,\" Poga\u010dar later said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar's Team UAE boss Mauro Gianetti described Vingegaard as a \"warrior\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's got the guts and the legs, and we expect him to keep on attacking every day now. He's a warrior,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battle for the overall lead, however, was eclipsed by a frantic fight for the stage win between EF's Healy and Soudal Quick-Step's Paret-Peintre, who became the first French winner on Mont Ventoux since Richard Virenque in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He looked so happy at the finish line,\" Poga\u010dar said.\n\n\n\nMont Ventoux has long been held in awe by riders and spectators alike, and it has witnessed some of the greatest dramas and tragedies in the Tour.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1967, the British cyclist Tom Simpson died here after collapsing on a baking climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe great Eddy Merckx once needed oxygen at the summit while Chris Froome ran part of the way up during a frantic wait for mechanical assistance on his way to a third Tour de France title in 2016.\n\n\n\nPerfect tactic\n\nHealy, who wore the yellow jersey for two days after winning the Bastille Day stage six, appeared to be heading for his second stage win as the two riders approached the finish of an epic tussle.\n\n\n\n\n\nParet-Peintre looked completely drained but, cheered on by the home crowd, he found a final surge of strength to overtake the Irishman with 20m remaining and held on to the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was near giving up. Healy was so strong, but I said to myself, 'Come on, it's the Tour de France, Mont Ventoux.'\" Paret-Peintre said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I knew that if I held on, the last section suited me better than him, as it's really steep. It turned out to be the perfect tactic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHealy's consolation was to be awarded the day's combativity prize while moving up one place to ninth in the overall standings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost unnoticed further down the mountain, German breakout star Florian Lipowitz consolidated his third place, extending his lead on fourth-placed Scottish rider Oscar Onley by around 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith two more Alpine stages to come and five stages left, Vingegaard and his Visma team did everything they could to hurt the Team UAE leader, Poga\u010dar, and can only hope they have tired the pugnacious champion.\n\n\n\nBut the 26-year-old resisted all they threw at him, despite being isolated from his teammates early in the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 17 should be one for the sprinters as Tim Merlier hopes to add to his two stage wins and current green jersey. Jonathan Milan also targets a second win at the 700m straight run to the finish line at Valence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weather, however, could rewrite the script with 50km/h winds forecast along the 170km run.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change, and every fraction of a degree of global heating matters, according to a new report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report examined climate change globally, with a focus on Australia's 2035 climate targets, which are yet to be announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Climate Council said climate pollution has led to average global temperatures increasing by 1.3C, driving more ferocious and frequent extreme weather.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, communities in parts of Australia have experienced cyclones, flooding, marine heatwaves, fires and droughts, with climate-fuelled disasters costing Australia more than a billion dollars this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future scale and severity of these issues will depend on how quickly governments reduce global climate pollution, according to the Climate Council report.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The problem that could cost Australia more than $8 billion every year\n\n\"Every fraction of a degree of global heating matters: the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees is existential for vulnerable communities, coral reefs, agriculture, and ecosystems,\" the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While many countries are now taking measures to cut climate pollution, the combined effort is not yet at the speed or scale required to protect humanity from the worst impacts of climate change.\"\n\n\n\nWhat could happen to Australia?\n\nThe report examined potential real-world impacts at different degrees of global warming, and found impacts \"amplify rapidly\" between 1.5 and 2C.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf global temperatures increase by 2C, extreme heat will become 2.6 times worse, the number of ice-free summers would become 10 times worse compared with 1.5C, the report said. It also found the number of invertebrates and plants lost would double, and the number of insect species lost would triple.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also said the decline of coral reefs would increase by up to 29 per cent, and the decline in marine fisheries would double.\n\n\n\nIf temperatures increased by 3C, Australia would become \"unrecognisable\", the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said the impacts would extend from \"very severe\" to \"catastrophic\", with extreme heat, droughts, cyclones, storms and flooding set to become more intense and frequent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHotter temperatures would exacerbate long-term factors that could damage physical and mental health, put infrastructure and population in cities under strain, and render many properties and businesses unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf global warming increased by 3C, Australia's coral reefs would cease to exist, along with many fishery and tourism industries, and marine ecosystems globally. Many land ecosystems and primary industries would be destroyed or changed \"beyond recognition\", according to the Climate Council.\n\n\n\nWhat are the recommendations?\n\nThe Climate Council said Australia's 2035 climate target must be \"very strong\", with analysis showing that net zero is the \"only target available\" with a strong chance of contributing to holding global warming below 2C.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir analysis found Australia needs to reduce climate pollution by 75 per cent or more from 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net zero by 2035 to adequately contribute to global targets.\n\n\n\nThe Climate Council also recommended amending the Climate Change Act to legislate 2035 targets into law, which it says will provide an important signal, leverage and policy certainty for coordination across all levels of government and the broader community.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also said Australia's climate targets should include a commitment to phase out fossil fuel use, production, exports and subsidies, including a clear plan with timelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said the targets must be based on \"genuine and real reductions\" to emissions, including minimising reliance on offsets.\n\n\n\nWhat is the government doing on climate change?\n\nThe Albanese government has made a series of steps and commitments on climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its first term, the government approved enough renewable energy to power more than 10 million homes, invested $1.2 billion to save the Great Barrier Reef, and enshrined a target of net zero emissions by 2050 into law.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it has also been criticised for its approval of coal mine extensions and oil and gas projects, which environmental groups say undermine credibility in tackling rising emissions.\n\n\n\nThe Greens are set to introduce a \"climate trigger\" bill to the new parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill would require the government to consider climate impacts when considering whether to approve projects like coal mines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our bill would force the climate impacts of projects to be considered by the minister, and it would also ensure mega-polluting projects can\u2019t get environmental approval at all,\" Greens leader Larissa Waters said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dirty fossil fuel projects need to be properly assessed for their impacts and rejected, so our kids, and all the precious species we share this beautiful planet with, have a safe climate future.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a challenging time to be aged in your 50s in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group is often known as the sandwich generation, balancing caring responsibilities for their aging parents and their children.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, a new report sheds light on a concerning perception of the group in the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile they're still far away from Australia's official retirement age of 67, more employers are viewing their workers as older once they hit the age of 51, according to research by the Australian H-R Institute and Australian Human Rights Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study also found while half of employers responding to the survey find it difficult to fill vacancies, just 56 per cent of them say they are to a large extent open to hire workers aged 50 to 64.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah McCann-Bartlett is the CEO of the Australian HR Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there's been a drop of the minimum age perceived to be old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's perhaps because we're in an era of really fast-paced technological change, and we know that there is an assumption, not necessarily correct, that older workers are not as good with technology as younger workers. And I think the other reason could be we've got a younger generation who are wanting to work (faster) through their careers and having career opportunities faster. So those two could be coming to bear a little bit around that view of what age a worker becomes older.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite that perception, Ms McCann-Bartlett says many employers actually find no differences in performances between older and younger workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it's not a new reality that workers in their 50s are being sidelined, as they are perceived as older in the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Carol Kulik from the University of South Australia has researched into the phenomenon of so-called 'queue jumpers', which refers to healthy workers choosing an early retirement in their 50s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd say that probably the biggest thing that we see, and there has been no change in this over time, is that hiring managers often make the assumption that they want to hire somebody who's going to give them a good return on investment, and so they believe that hiring a younger person means that the younger person is going to stay in the job longer, and an older person, well, the closer they get to retirement, the more likely they are to leave.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kulik says that's a mistaken assumption, as several studies have found young people tend to change jobs more frequently.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the reason it's so hard to change this is because some hiring professionals still hold outdated beliefs about the relationships between organisations and employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We just have decades of an understanding of employment relationships where organisations would hire new employees based on potential, and they saw it as a long-term commitment, but we're seeing such dramatic changes in what people want from employment relationships. So for example, right now, we're seeing that 60 to 70% of new entrants to the labour force say that they don't want to become managers. Well, the way we've traditionally retained people is to promote them into managerial roles. So I think some of the thinking of hiring managers hasn't really caught up to what we're seeing in the data.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Discrimination Commissioner Robert Fitzgerald also says ageism in employment has been present for a long time, but it's time that Australia takes efforts to challenge it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Businesses today need to recognise that Australian society is changing, their customers are changing, and there is a need in many businesses to represent older faces and older voices in their businesses. There's also chronic labour shortages, and therefore businesses need to be able to meet those shortages, and the only way they're going to be able to do that is by engaging with older people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Marlene Krasovotsky is part of Everyage Counts, a community organisation against ageism.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says as Australia has an ageing population, the phenomenon of 'the sandwich generation' will only get more and more common.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd one way to counter ageism is to allow people of various ages to work together.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe menus are printed and ready for 24 York\u2019s first day of service \u2013 but whether diners will need them is another story. The latest opening from Hunter St. Hospitality, the group behind Rockpool Bar & Grill, Spice Temple and The Collective, sticks to a tight format: with just one main course, one side and one dessert. The star of the show is the classic French bistro dish of steak frites, with chef Santi Aristizabal using the same scotch fillet cut from Gippsland that he has on the menu at sister restaurant Rockpool Bar & Grill in Melbourne. The steak frites at 24 York is made with O\u2019Connor scotch fillet and comes with a choice of four sauces. When you offer just one steak, serious consideration is invested in its selection. The trio of culinary directors at Hunter St. Hospitality, chefs Aristizabal, Andy Evans and Shimpei Hatanaka, first had to eliminate other cuts such as hanger, skirt and sirloin before deciding on scotch fillet for a range of reasons, including fat content, chewiness, mouth feel and taste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe steaks were lined up in a blind tasting of scotch fillet from 12 suppliers. Aristizabal, who oversees all three Rockpools in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, said at $48 (with chips), the 220-gram scotch fillet from Gippsland producer O\u2019Connor is good value. \u201cAt Rockpool in Melbourne you pay $95 for 400g on the bone, which is around 350g bone off. The steak at 24 York is only one marble score lower [than Rockpool].\u201d Diners will still have some decisions to make. The steak can be cooked two ways \u2013 medium or well done \u2013 and comes with a choice of four sauces: peppercorn, mushroom, chimichurri or umami butter infused with kombu, eschalot, garlic and lemon. Hunter St. Hospitality\u2019s culinary directors Andy Evans, Santi Aristizabal and Shimpei Hatanaka will oversee 24 York when it opens in July. Steven Woodburn To achieve a rosy pink centre, the fillets are seared on a very hot grill for two to three minutes, rested, then returned to the grill for a final char, before being seasoned with Murray River salt and served pre-cut in thick slices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTucker doesn\u2019t hide from the fact 24 York\u2019s steak frites approach takes inspiration from Le Relais de l\u2019Entrecote in France, which has successfully leant on steak and chips for more than half a century. He says customers increasingly appreciate venues that do a single thing well, but said critical mass is needed for the concept. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done this in Surry Hills,\u201d Tucker said. With Rockpool and The Cut in its portfolio, Tucker is confident his group has the chops in the steak department. He said the decision to include chips was easy: \u201cThe one thing that always ends up on every table [that orders steak] is chips.\u201d The fries fall somewhere between a standard cut chip and a French fry, and like those at Olympic Meats in Marrickville and Rosie\u2019s in Coledale, they\u2019re cooked in beef tallow for a richer, meatier flavour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe single side dish is a simple green salad made with seasonal leaves and a mustard dressing. Drinks are equally tight and affordable. There are four house wines \u2013 two reds and two whites, priced from $12-$13 by the glass or $39-$45 by the bottle. Asahi, Resch\u2019s and Guinness are on tap, while the cocktail selection consists of six classics, including a martini, negroni and old fashioned \u2013 all priced at $18. The opening of 24 York also signals a shift in strategy for Hunter St. Hospitality. The venue has opened in the former home of The Bavarian, which the group decided to close after operating at the York Street site for the past 14 years to focus on \u201cunique venues\u201d rather than chains. \u201cThe area\u2019s changed,\u201d Hunter St. Hospitality chief executive Frank Tucker said. That change is reflected in the restaurant\u2019s more refined fit-out, which is elegant without being overdone. The 200-seat restaurant nods to the New York bistro style with dark timber finishes, globe pendant lights and intimate booths framed by short sheer shop-curtains. And the dessert? It\u2019s a mini New York cheesecake with fresh raspberries and a quenelle of vanilla ice cream.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Geoff Hutchison has officially entered the harrumph zone. Change is everywhere. His waning status. His ageing body. This whole shot-to-hell world. Whether on ubiquitous screens or the drive to the supermarket, stupidity and inconvenience conspire to exasperate him. His mission now: How Not to Become a Grumpy Old Bugger. \u201cI genuinely think I\u2019m a better person for having written it,\u201d the former ABC radio presenter says of his first book, subtitled A bloke\u2019s guide to living a better life. \u201cI\u2019ve had cause at times to remind myself, if I\u2019m going to tell other people how they should live their lives, I\u2019ve got to respond to that. I\u2019ve got to take this stuff seriously.\u201d After 40 years as a journalist, not least with Foreign Correspondent and 7.30, he knows serious. But it was his last 16 in talkback on ABC Perth that gave him the necessary tone for a book addressing the minefield of male discontent: rigorous enquiry, sure, but with a lightness of touch that invites leaning in. \u201cI wanted to hit blokes between the eyes on a couple of things, but I also know they will put the book down and never read another paragraph if I can\u2019t win them over to the conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough I still think their partners might read bits of it out loud to them in bed. That would make me happy too.\u201d In terms of inspiration, he recalls one beacon of grump from early in his talkback career: February 13, 2008, the day new PM Kevin Rudd apologised to the Stolen Generations. \u201cI reckon the first six callers were blokes, and they were all saying, \u2018I don\u2019t see that I should have to apologise for anything\u2019. I didn\u2019t say it on air but I thought, \u2018Oh my god, how can these blokes be such bastards?\u2019 \u201cBack then I took it personally. I don\u2019t now. I would now want to say to those blokes: \u2018This isn\u2019t about you. Not everything that happens in the world is about you.\u2019 That whole \u2018Harrumph, well I don\u2019t like it\u2019 \u2013 I want to convince them to just let some things go.\u201d Hutchison\u2019s book is not interested in culture wars. He isn\u2019t out to debate pronouns or cancel culture. What he\u2019s describing is something quieter and more insidious: a kind of emotional shrinkage, a stubborn stand-off with acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou raise the kids, the job ends, and you become a little less interesting to everyone. That\u2019s the bit no one tells you,\u201d he says, with the fresh insight of the recent retiree. \u201cAnd if you were defined by that role\u201d \u2013 the job, the dad, the problem-solver \u2013 \u201cI think you\u2019re very vulnerable to sadness. And loneliness.\u201d Hutchison spent the last 16 years working at ABC radio, where many of his callers helped inspire his book. The grim end of male sadness is devastating. In Australia, Hutchison discovered, 86 men call an ambulance every day with thoughts of suicide. In 2023 alone, 64 women were killed in acts of male violence. But he doesn\u2019t have to consult experts and statistics to see the darkness festering in blokes\u2019 heads. He recalls stumbling on a social media chat sharing the praises of Italian restaurants. \u201cEvery positive comment came from a woman. Every negative and unnecessary one came from a bloke. And I\u2019m just thinking, who are you? What are you doing, sitting at a keyboard, hating everything? Is there any pleasure in that?\u201d Then there was a bloke named Ian, compelled to comment under an exultant photo of three young footy players with hands casually resting on each other\u2019s knees. \u201cBack when I played footy,\u201d Ian said, \u201cwe would get the shit kicked out of us for posing like that.\u201d TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO GEOFF HUTCHISON Worst habit? It used to be celebrating cynicism. But after hearing Billy Bragg declare that \u201ccynicism is the enemy of hope\u201d, I am now determinedly of the same opinion. Greatest fear? I don\u2019t like them Fascists very much. Indeed, anyone who seeks political advantage by using fear to target and blame \u201cothers\u201d. And I\u2019m wary of anyone who thinks the concept of Prosperity Theology is endorsed by a greater power. The line that stayed with you? \u201dLove this life, don\u2019t wait \u2019til the next one comes\u201d \u2013 Neil Finn. Biggest regret? A kitchen accident that left my young son only partially sighted. I had my back turned as he tried to open a bag of apples with scissors. And yes, it was as awful as it sounds. I\u2019ve written about it for the first time in my book in the chapter titled Regret. Favourite book? Richard Ford\u2019s The Sportswriter (1986). I was a young version of one at the time. The artwork/song you wish was yours? The Portrait of the Journalist Sylvia von Harden by the German painter Otto Dix. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? London in the mid \u201960s please, with plenty of money in my pocket. And if you could get me into the Marquee Club to see \u2026 oh I dunno, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix that would be splendid. \u201cThat bloke is just curating a museum of dickheadedness,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cIt\u2019s awful, and I bet it\u2019s making him sick. I bet his wife doesn\u2019t like him much. And I bet his son doesn\u2019t come home to watch footy on Friday nights because he can\u2019t bear to hear Dad talk about their haircuts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat author doesn\u2019t exempt himself. He recounts one episode of fuming at an umpire\u2019s call that his daughter, gently, had to tell him was pathetic. He talks about making his mates laugh by impersonating \u201csome dickhead\u201d at the pub. \u201cI find that kind of cynicism less funny now. When blokes shrink into that tight, narrow worldview, they must be awful to live with.\u201d He owns that too. Post-ABC, he assumed more time with his wife, Philippa. But her career as a documentary maker is firing. \u201cShe\u2019s about to fly to the UK for three weeks of interviews. So I had to remind myself: you don\u2019t need to be at the centre of everything. You can swan around on the edges. Pick and choose how you want to engage. Just make sure you do.\u201d The active pursuit of engagement is a theme of Hutchison\u2019s book. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got male friends, place some value on that friendship. Whatever the next five, 10, 20 years look like \u2013 and they might be terrific, or they might be absolutely shithouse \u2013 you want to have people to talk to about it.\u201d That refusal to disappear, to keep showing up, runs through the people he interviews. There\u2019s social researcher and psychologist Hugh Mackay, still sharp and empathetic at 86. Alex Pearce, the Fremantle Dockers\u2019 captain is emotionally open in a way Hutchison finds quietly radical. Through his son he meets a trans woman named Gemma, whose calm presence contrasts powerfully with the rage of anonymous detractors. Two GPs talk bluntly about ageing bodies behind pseudonyms designed to tickle sci-fi-nerds: Peter Venkman and Leonard McCoy. At both ends, it\u2019s Hutchison\u2019s late father who anchors the book. The man who blithely proclaimed his unhappiness as a fact of life when Geoff was a boy \u201cused to come home from the Italian Club in Pickering Brook and say, \u2018God, people are stupid\u2019. I used to think, \u2018Is it just the gang you\u2019re hangin\u2019 out with Dad?\u2019 I\u2019ve got to believe not everyone is quite so venal or miserable.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "GM says it believes it can eventually offset about a third of the $US4 billion to $US5 billion cost of the tariffs this year by cutting costs and shifting some production to the US. That suggests the ongoing cost of the tariffs in the near term will be more than $US3.3 billion a year, though GM executives hope that trade deals with South Korea, Mexico and Canada \u2013 where most of its imported cars are sourced \u2013 may reduce that cost. As this quarterly earnings season in the US continues, commentaries from trade-exposed US companies will be pored over for references to the tariffs and how the companies are responding to them. GM chief Mary Barra. There is more pain coming for the car giant. Credit: Bloomberg Last week\u2019s June inflation data showed that in sectors directly exposed to tariffs \u2013 sectors such as fresh fruit and vegetables, household appliances, furniture, toys, clothing and sporting goods \u2013 prices are rising. The cost of the tariffs in those sectors is being passed onto customers and is affecting the inflation rate.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of inventory loading occurring in the US to get ahead of the tariffs, so their impact on the inflation rate and/or companies\u2019 profits should progressively increase as those pre-tariff stocks run down. Loading Some companies, of course, benefit from the protection provided by tariffs, which shield them to some degree from competition from imports, and where the increased cost of imports provides cover for domestic firms to raise their own prices. The US steel industry, with aluminium, was one of the earliest beneficiaries of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium imports in February and then doubled the rate, to 50 per cent, last month. About 23 per cent of the steel supply in the US is imported, with the rest produced domestically by steelmakers that are regarded as the world\u2019s most expensive producers.\n\nTheir response to Trump\u2019s tariffs has, predictably, been opportunistic. They\u2019ve raised their prices, which are up about 16 per cent this year. That\u2019s history repeating. In 2018, during Trump\u2019s initial trade war with China, he imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel imports, and the US steelmakers responded by lifting their prices by about 10 per cent, which added about $US2.5 billion to their profits. The 2018 experience shows that companies also improved their capacity utilisation and added investment and jobs \u2013 but the impact was relatively short-lived, and the costs in jobs and lost earnings to steel-consuming industries were multiples of the benefits created for the steel producers. Not only is the duty on steel today double what it was in 2018, but it applies more broadly, not just to imported steel but also to imports of steel \u201cderivatives\u201d, or products where steel is a major component.\n\nThe impact on the tariff on steel \u2013 and similar tariffs on aluminium and copper \u2013 will percolate through the US manufacturing sector, with a particular impact on an auto industry that is also subject to its own tariffs. If Trump follows through with his threatened 50 per cent tariff on all imports from Brazil (unless Brazilian authorities drop their prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro for an alleged attempted coup), the tariffs\u2019 impact on the cost of steel would be exacerbated. Brazil is a major supplier of raw materials to the sector. At some point, probably not too far into the distant future, GM and other US manufacturers will be overwhelmed by the cost increases flowing from the barrage of tariffs on auto and auto part imports and on their raw materials and be unable to absorb them without passing on a substantial proportion to customers. That is when their full effects on the inflation rate will start to show up. The \u201cTrump effect\u201d on the auto industry isn\u2019t confined to tariffs.\n\nHis aversion to electric vehicles and climate-related initiatives and his assault on the Biden administration\u2019s subsidies and incentives for carbon emission reductions and green energy, includes the withdrawal of subsidies for EV purchases and tax credits for emissions reductions. That will hit Tesla, which has relied on the sale of the regulatory credits for its profitability \u2013 it would be loss-making without them \u2013 hardest. While Trump keeps claiming that the US is collecting massive amounts of tariff revenue from other countries\u2019 exporters, the GM experience underscores what almost everyone else has always understood. It might, in the near term, help other US EV manufacturers, even GM \u2013 the second-largest US domestic manufacturer of EVs \u2013 which have had to buy the credits to offset the emissions from their larger internal combustion vehicle production. What it and, thanks to tariff and non-tariff barriers, the near-total absence of competition from imported EVs will do, however, is drive up the cost of domestically produced EVs, reduce their sales volumes and undermine the scale efficiencies that might lead to EV profitability.",

        "text": "Ghosted by a friend? 4 expert tips on how to handle the hurt\n\nWhen we talk about \u201cghosting\u201d, we usually think it relates to dating. But what happens when you\u2019ve been ghosted by someone you\u2019ve known for years \u2013 your childhood best friend, a parent, a child?\n\nThese disappearances can be harder to explain, and even harder to heal from.\n\nIt\u2019s also surprisingly common. For instance, one study showed 38.6% of people have been ghosted by a friend.\n\nSo why do people ghost those closest to them? What impact does it have on those left behind? How do you begin to move on?\n\nWhat is ghosting?\n\nGhosting is when someone abruptly, or gradually, cuts off all communication without explanation. Whether it\u2019s a friend, family member or love interest, the signs are much the same \u2013 messages left on read or calls ignored. Sometimes you\u2019re blocked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGhosting doesn\u2019t just happen online. It can also play out in person, when someone deliberately ignores you \u2013 avoiding eye contact, refusing attempts to engage in conversation, pretending you\u2019re not there.\n\nUnlike relationships that gradually wither over time, or end abruptly after an argument, ghosting is a one-sided withdrawal from a relationship that happens without closure.\n\nFor the person left behind, it can feel like grief.\n\nWhy do people ghost family and friends?\n\nPeople often ghost friends for the same reasons they ghost romantic partners.\n\nGhosting is more common \u2013 and considered more acceptable \u2013 in brief or casual romantic relationships or friendships. That\u2019s when people may ghost because they lose interest, wish to avoid confrontation, or find it easier than facing the discomfort of ending things directly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn longer-term relationships, ghosting may stem from incompatibility, be prompted by different priorities, physical distance, or growing apart over time.\n\nMajor life transitions \u2013 such as becoming a parent, entering the workforce, moving, or going through a divorce \u2013 can often provide the catalyst for someone to shrink their social network.\n\nIn some cases, ghosting is driven by self-preservation or concerns for personal safety, particularly when ghosting involves family members.\n\nPeople report ghosting in response to toxic, emotionally draining, or abusive relationships, often when previous attempts to resolve issues were met with abuse or aggression. In such instances, ghosting isn\u2019t so much an avoidance strategy, but a last resort to preserve someone\u2019s safety and psychological wellbeing.\n\nGhosting has also been linked to certain personality traits. One study found people who reported ghosting others tended to score higher in narcissism (tend towards entitlement and lack of empathy) and borderline traits (so have trouble regulating emotions and are impulsive).\n\nWhy does it hurt so much?\n\nPeople often ghost as they hope to spare the other person the pain of rejection. But that is rarely the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBeing ghosted by someone you\u2019ve been close to for a long time is often associated with grief, much like the death of the loved one. After the initial shock, there is often anger and sadness.\n\nGhosting also involves \u201cambiguous loss\u201d. This ambiguity \u2013 the uncertainty and lack of closure \u2013 can almost freeze the grief process, making it particularly hard to move on.\n\nIn addition to grief-like emotions, ghosting is also often associated with self-blame, rumination, feelings of worthlessness, and trust issues that can affect how someone relates to others in the future.\n\nHow to cope if you\u2019ve been ghosted\n\nThere\u2019s no easy fix and you can\u2019t force someone to communicate with you if they don\u2019t want to. But research points to some strategies that may help you move on and ease the pain:\n\nAcknowledge your feelings. Grief-like emotions are a normal reaction to being ghosted. Accept your emotions and express them in healthy ways. This is better than suppressing them, which is linked to depression, low self-esteem and reduced wellbeing. Seek social support. Social support is linked to a range of mental health benefits. Talk about your experience with friends, family or a mental health professional. This can help reduce feeling of isolation, and low self-worth. Greater social support is also associated with post-traumatic growth \u2013 positive psychological change that can emerge after a challenging life event. Choose self-compassion over rumination. It\u2019s easy to get caught in the trap of replaying what happened and wondering what went wrong. But this can prolong distress and make it harder to move on. Instead treat yourself as you would a close friend \u2013 with kindness, compassion and care. Self-compassion has been linked to reduced rumination, anxiety and depression. Exercise, mindfulness and spending time in nature are examples of self-care with similar psychological benefits. Create your own closure. Being ghosted can often leave you stuck in a cycle of uncertainty and unanswered questions. You may never get an explanation and waiting for answers will only make it harder to move on. Writing a letter you don\u2019t send can help create closure. This form of expressive writing can help you articulate your thoughts and emotions and make sense of your experience \u2013 and is linked to a range of psychological benefits.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
