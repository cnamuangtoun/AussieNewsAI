(Reuters: Nick Carey)\n\nThe IEA said the gap between ICE and EV prices in Mexico fell to 50 per cent in 2024, from 100 per cent the year prior, driving sales of Chinese imports up to 66 per cent of all sales.\n\nMr Birol said analysis of the life-time costs of running an EV were cheaper than a conventional car.\n\n\"On a kilometre-driven basis, on the data we have today with oil at $US66 a barrel, in all key markets it is cheaper to run your car with electricity,\" he said.\n\nCharging forward\n\nDemand for EV batteries is expected to drive overall battery demand from now until 2023, according to the IEA.\n\nBut demand is expected to be super-charged by the wider adoption of electric heavy vehicles, including trucks and buses, which grew by 80 per cent in 2024, mainly driven by China.\n\nThere was no change to the average range of EVs in 2024, which is estimated at 340km across all models.\n\n\"As market competition intensifies, the fact that average range has stabilised in the past year could indicate that car makers have found an optimal balance between range performance and vehicle manufacturing costs,\" the report said.\n\nThe IEA expects 20 million EVs to be sold in 2025.",

I kept away from stripey things, because I was like, 'I don't want to feel like I'm in prison,'\" Walker says, between bites of leftover pizza, and sips of a nettle tea she shipped over from Iceland.\n\n\"I had these white pants that I ended up painting and, once I was out of prison and I wore them out, I got so many compliments on them \u2026 I remember this American, a sweet young woman, telling me how much she loved my pants. And I was like, 'Yeah, I painted them when I was in prison,' and she just gave me this really weird look.\"\n\nIt's been eight years since Walker's name was splashed across international headlines after being convicted for assaulting her then partner and being imprisoned in a high-security jail near Reykjavik.\n\nThrough it all, she painted \u2014 a creative expression that helped her endure; that has always helped her.\n\nPainting has been integral to Walker processing her experience in Iceland. (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\n\"I'm making very expressionistic art \u2026 in that it's moved through my emotions. It's created as a response to something,\" she says.\n\n\"My experience with facing a court system, facing a travel ban, all of that would be so different because, no matter what, I was never alone because I had my art. I always had a form of expression.\"\n\nWalker uses her whole body to create expressive paintings, a process she finds therapeutic. (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\nIt's been four years since Walker, who was released from H\u00f3lmshei\u00f0i Prison in May 2019, returned to Australia.\n\nIn the garden shed-turned art studio in her mum's backyard in Queensland, Walker paints fast, finishing a few paintings a week.\n\nThe practice helps her to reconnect to herself, process traumatic memories and heal.\n\nThough she doesn't see her work as art therapy.\n\n\"My work is therapeutic but I am an artist, in the forefront,\" she says.\n\nShe's also, since her return to Australia, been fighting \u2014 alongside several other women, backed by Icelandic women's and equality organisations \u2014 for Iceland to change how it investigates and prosecutes violence against women.\n\nThe women are suing Iceland for what they allege is a failure to protect them from gender-based violence and inadequate investigation of their claims. A judgement from the European Court of Human Rights is forthcoming.\n\n\"Art is an amazing gift for us as humanity, to be able to witness other people's inner journeys, and then ... to understand.\" (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\nA state of shock\n\nIn 2018, Walker was involved in an incident with her then-partner, in which she, as her mother would later tell an Iceland court, \"defended herself when he stuck his tongue right down her throat and she bit down on his tongue and took off the tip of it\". Walker was arrested soon after.\n\n\"I didn't really understand what I had done. I was kind of observing myself from outside of my body,\" Walker says.\n\n\"Suddenly, the police were there and I was just in a state of shock and kind of shaking on the stairs and not really understanding the whole thing of what had just happened.\n\n\"The police came in, they ended up handcuffing me, and I just \u2026 kept repeating that I was the victim.\"\n\n\"How could a love be so wrong,\" Walker wrote in her journal in Iceland. (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\nIn her trial in Iceland, Walker gave evidence detailing years of abuse from her partner, including text messages where he admitted putting the drug LSD in her tea. But the Icelandic system does not always recognise a woman's experience of domestic violence as a defence for assault.\n\nHer ex-partner has denied the abuse allegations.\n\nThe work Walker created in prison is \"very raw\", she says. (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\nPainting to survive\n\nThree difficult years navigating Iceland's legal system followed \u2014 but Walker employed art as a survival tool whenever she could.\n\nBefore she was formally convicted, her passport was confiscated. She became homeless, was eating at a soup kitchen and rapidly lost weight. Her hair began to fall out.\n\nStories about her made national and international media. It wasn't until weeks later, when the news died down, that women's shelters in Reykjavik agreed to see her.\n\nWhen she first arrived at a shelter, she didn't have art materials so she used her phone to create. She made a video featuring black and white images of her face, switching between dead stares and grainy screams.\n\n\"I called it Silent Scream because the images really capture the angst of what I was experiencing in that moment in time. It's such an internal journey of pain and suffering.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nWalker would come to learn that while Iceland is reported to be the world's most gender-equal country, statistics of gender-based and sexual violence are high.\n\nWalker was convicted of assault on March 7, 2018, and was handed a 12-month sentence. On appeal, her sentence was increased to 18 months, with 15 months suspended. Walker ultimately spent one month in high-security prison and two in a community facility.\n\nIn prison, where Walker was allowed paints and markers, she says she wanted to \"fall to the ground and scream, cry and rip my hair out, but I had to hold composure\".\n\n\"I had different tactics, which was my art, movement [and] writing.\n\n\"I was painting and drawing lots and lots of abstract faces,\" she says.\n\n\"It was really interesting. I was like, 'Maybe these faces are all these people who have been experiencing trauma like my own,' and in some way, it's almost like I'm not alone \u2014 I had these faces with me.\n\n\"Some of them are really scary \u2026 and dark.\"\n\nIn prison, painting after painting of abstracted faces poured out of Walker. (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\nWalker made a lot of paintings in prison, about 75, and later exhibited them in Reykjavik in an exhibition called Room.\n\n\"I filled the wall with all of these pieces, and was very lucky to then connect with the arts community there.\"\n\nShe served her three-month term and was released in May 2019. The suspended portion of her sentence expired in August 2020.\n\nUnable to leave the country until her suspended sentence was over and passport returned, Walker lived in a halfway house, then began staying in artist residencies around Iceland.\n\n\"I was making so much art \u2026 I started to connect with this resilient side of myself, not just the survivor.\n\n\"It was a very pinnacle point where I was able to connect with who I was before all of this because art is who I am.\"\n\nWalker's paintings sometimes begin as charcoal drawings, such as these ones being unrolled in her studio. (ABC Arts: Eloise Fuss)\n\nPainting with her whole body\n\nWalker returned to Australia in 2019 to the sanctuary of her mum's Sunshine Coast house, which backs onto a quiet patch of tropical scrub. She nonchalantly mentions to watch out for pythons \u2014 a small-fry threat for her nowadays.\n\nWalker's begun to notice a \"massive change\" in herself. \"Suddenly, I was like, 'Oh, I'm feeling [like] me again.'\" Pictured wearing a dress she designed featuring her art.

        "text": "Analysts say the still-simmering trade dispute between China and the United States could open further opportunities for Australia's critical minerals sector.\n\nGallium, a mineral critical to computer processing, is one of the resources caught in the tariff battle, with China \u2014 the world's biggest supplier \u2014 banning exports to the US last year.\n\nWhile the Australian industry is still in its early stages, global interest in artificial intelligence and the Albanese government's focus on critical minerals has sparked research and exploration in Western Australia with hopes of tapping the $3.8 billion international market.\n\nWhat is gallium?\n\nGallium is one of Australia's 31 critical minerals with a wide range of uses, but it has gained attention recently for its efficiency in computer chip technology.\n\nGallium has a low melting point and turns to liquid at just below 30 degrees. (Commons: AndrewDaGamer; Liquid gallium; licence)\n\nIt is chiefly used in semiconductor production for smartphones and high-speed computer chips.\n\nAs computers and technology become more advanced, there is an increasing need for quicker and more efficient semiconductors.\n\nDeputy director of Curtin University's Trailblazer program Andrew Bell said China's export ban had shone a spotlight on gallium.\n\n\"Mining companies have started to look at it in a lot more detail since then,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Bell says there is an opportunity for gallium production to grow. (Supplied: Curtin University)\n\n\"I definitely don't think that it's the be-all and end-all of critical mineral production in Australia.\n\n\" But I do see the growth potential for gallium, based on geopolitical activities around the world, and [there's a] really great opportunity here for WA to be a big player in gallium production. \"\n\nMost standard computer semiconductors are made using silicon, which is relatively cheap and plentiful.\n\nAI chatbots require high speed computer technology to process information instantly. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nScientists believe gallium-based semiconductors are better for more advanced applications because they can run faster, be smaller and consume less power.\n\n'A growth market'\n\nCompared to a commodity such as iron ore, the world consumes a minuscule amount of gallium.\n\nBut it is lucrative, with the price at the time of writing about $1,000 per kilogram, up 236 per cent since 2020.\n\nAccording to a report from the Business Research Company, the worldwide gallium market is projected to grow to $US6.6 billion by 2029.\n\nData from the CSIRO shows global demand for gallium is expected to reach 1,180 tonnes by 2030. (Source: CSIRO)\n\nGrowth in the sector is not just driven by the AI revolution but also advancements in healthcare, 6G telecommunications and tech used by the defence industry.\n\nCSIRO senior scientist Chris Vernon said gallium was \"dwarfed\" compared to the value of other minerals, its high price driving its value.\n\nChris Vernon specialises in critical minerals. (Supplied: CSIRO)\n\n\"Despite it being a relatively small trade around the world, it turns into one of those things where if you don't have it \u2014 you'll pay any price for it,\" Dr Vernon said.\n\n\"Put yourself in the shoes of a chip maker who is about to make the latest AI chip that is going to run 100 times better than anyone else's, if you can't get the raw material you just don't have a business.\"\n\nRace to supply\n\nAcross the globe, gallium is usually sourced as a bi-product in bauxite mining, used to make aluminium.\n\nIn Western Australia, exploration company Nimy Resources started drilling for gallium on Wednesday after a surprise discovery of the mineral in a sample last year.\n\nExecutive director Christian Price hoped the company could potentially be an alternative source of gallium outside China.\n\nGallium is most commonly processed as a bi-product in bauxite mining. (Supplied)\n\n\"It's one of those markets where we start to see gallium, you start to see the uses, you'll start to see it everywhere,\" Mr Price said.\n\n\"[Gallium] is going to be on the lips of a lot more technology manufacturers in the future and we'll start to understand the criticality of that to our modern world.\"\n\nResearchers from Curtin University's School of Mines are working with Nimy Resources to further understand gallium's extraction process.",

        "text": "Newborns who are deficient in vitamin D have a higher chance of developing mental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), researchers have found.\n\nIn the largest study of its kind, they tested the vitamin D status of more than 70,000 people as babies, using dried blood spots kept on filter paper from their heel prick tests in the first few days of life.\n\nWhy you need vitamin D and when it's safe to get it Photo shows A young woman sits in the shade behind a tree in a park Should you worry if you're not getting as much sunlight as you did over summer?\n\nUniversity of Queensland (UQ) psychiatric researcher John McGrath led the painstaking study, which analysed vitamin D levels from a sample of people born between 1981 and 2005 in Denmark, where the filter paper from the tests is kept.\n\nThey compared vitamin D data from a random selection of the Danish population without mental disorders to people with autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, major depression, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa.\n\n\"We found that low vitamin D was linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia, autism and ADHD,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\n\"We don't think that vitamin D during adulthood has anything to do with these disorders. We're talking about low vitamin D during early brain development.\n\n\" The baby can't make its own vitamin D. All the vitamin D that we measure from the baby as a newborn has come from the mother. \"\n\n'The sunshine vitamin'\n\nProfessor McGrath, of UQ's Queensland Brain Institute, said the new evidence suggested optimal vitamin D during early life is \"not only important to build strong bones, but also to build healthy brains\".\n\nHe described \"very low\" vitamin D as being less than 25 nanomoles per litre of blood.\n\nWhile the study adds to previous research suggesting low maternal vitamin D involvement in schizophrenia, autism and ADHD, he stressed that mental health disorders are multi-factorial, with a wide range of genetics and environmental factors also playing a key role.\n\nJohn McGrath says the findings suggest vitamin D is important for building healthy brains. (Supplied)\n\n\"We know that many other factors can impact on orderly brain development, such as prenatal infection,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\n\"Obstetric complications and childhood trauma may also be linked to later mental disorders.\"\n\nIn schizophrenia, smoking cannabis in adolescence is considered a trigger in susceptible people.\n\nProfessor McGrath has spent the past three decades trying to identify risk factors, such as low vitamin D, that can be modified in the hope that it will decrease the incidence of the disorders.\n\nThe findings from the latest study suggest that if vitamin D is a true causal factor, 15 per cent of schizophrenia cases, 9 per cent of ADHD, and 5 per cent of autism could have been prevented if all participants had vitamin D levels of more than 21 nanomoles per litre of blood as a newborn.\n\nBut Professor McGrath said those estimates were based on people living in Denmark, not in Australia, where individuals are less likely to be vitamin D deficient.\n\nVitamin D is often referred to as \"the sunshine vitamin\" because the sun is one of the best sources. It is also found in some foods and can be taken as a supplement.\n\nIn Australia, vitamin D supplementation in margarine is mandatory.\n\nChanges to pregnancy care guidelines\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), Amanda Henry said families should not be \"either unduly alarmed or overly hopeful\" about the study findings.\n\nProfessor of obstetrics Amanda Henry, program head of women\u2019s health at The George Institute for Global Health. (Supplied)\n\n\"We're definitely not talking here that this explains everything about these conditions,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Henry, who was not involved in the research, said RANZCOG guidelines already recommended that women take vitamin D as part of pregnancy supplementation.\n\nBut she said routine vitamin D screening was not recommended.\n\nThe program head for women's health at The George Institute for Global Health said the federal government was funding a review of Australia's pregnancy care guidelines led by RANZCOG and the Australian College of Midwives.\n\nThe federal government is funding a review of Australia's pregnancy care guidelines. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\n\"Vitamin D is one of the topics that's currently under development to be actively updated,\" Professor Henry said.\n\n\"We're waiting on the latest research on that to be integrated, then we will have updated guidance for mums and families around Australia in terms of what to do with vitamin D and many other things in pregnancy.\n\n\" We try not to be static in pregnancy and infant care and are doing our best to get some nationally consistent guidance that's responsive to evidence for the best care for pregnant mums and babies. \"\n\nProfessor McGrath's work is funded by the Danish National Research Foundation, the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research and the UQ.\n\nThe vitamin D study is published in The Lancet Psychiatry.",

(ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nRDA Yorke and Mid North chief executive Daniel Willson said many businesses were \"caught out\" by the lack of insurance coverage for blackouts and encouraged owners to shift policies if necessary.\n\n\"Retail trade businesses suffered, those that have perishable stock,\" Mr Willson said.\n\n\"They've got some fairly stringent food safety requirements to observe,\" he said.\n\n\"When they can't rely on their fridges and freezers to keep running \u2026 they have to cut their losses to avoid impacting the health of consumers.\n\n\"We did have quite a few residences and households get in touch because they were frustrated that they hadn't had better coverage and service.\n\nThe caravan park at Edithburgh plunged into darkness during the 24-hour blackout. (ABC News: Alana Calvert)\n\n\"There was some pretty concerning stuff \u2014 families who had to drive around in cars to keep babies in air conditioning, quite a few people who had temperature-sensitive medication who had to drive back to Adelaide to replace their medication.\"\n\nMr Willson said a full report will be released in the coming weeks.\n\nNo compensation\n\nSo far, SA Power Networks, ElectraNet, and the state government have indicated compensation will not be offered to businesses.\n\nSouth Australians can claim $100 a year for an outage lasting more than 20 hours, but it only applies to supply issues and not transmission faults, which caused the March blackout.\n\nIndependent MP for Narungga, Fraser Ellis, said he would lobby the government to expand the Small Claims Scheme to include outages.\n\nNarungga MP Fraser Ellis says his office is investigating how the Small Claims Scheme can cover outages. (Facebook)\n\n\"I think it's unfair that a business should have to keep that level of inconvenience through no fault of their own,\" Mr Ellis said.\n\n\"I haven't got a yes or no, but I will keep trucking away at it.\n\n\"Recently the government extended [the Small Claims Scheme] to voltage variations, so they appreciate the need for it, but in this case, it's the same outcome with just a slightly different cause.\"\n\nTransport and Infrastructure Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the government would give Mr Ellis' proposal \"due consideration and consider [its] implications\".\n\nMr Koutsantonis previously said that SA Power Networks' equipment was not at fault.\n\nBusinesses had to close during the blackout. (ABC News: Alana Calvert)\n\n'Sheer expanse of problem'\n\nYorke Peninsula residents reported several rolling, localised blackouts in the days leading up to the major outage.\n\nIn the aftermath, ElectraNet said it proactively monitored power equipment for dust accumulation and blamed low rainfall across South Australia, which otherwise would have washed away excess build-up.\n\nOn Tuesday, SA Power Networks spokesperson Cecilia Schulz told ABC Radio Adelaide that helicopter and ground patrols had begun monitoring 55,000km of power lines to detect faults leading up to the next bushfire season.\n\nMs Schulz said the March outage was not caused by insufficient patrolling.\n\n\"It is the sheer expanse of the problem over the Yorke Peninsula, the number of poles and conductors that do have insulator pollution, and the ability of our crews to get to all of them and wash them,\" Ms Schulz said.\n\n\"We've had to go through this process of identifying the areas of the network that are causing the problems and manually washing them, but it hasn't been possible to do that for the whole peninsula.\"",

(Supplied: Parkes Energy Recovery)\n\nMr Nicholas said the facility would use \"safe, proven, reliable technology\" and NSW had among the strictest guidelines in the world.\n\n\"The NSW Environment Protection Authority and Department of Planning have put in place a regime that is as strict as anywhere else in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"These are facilities that are in some places like downtown Copenhagen \u2026 as close as 200 metres from residents.\n\n\"The fact that it is safe in that sort of environment should give people comfort.\"\n\nThe East Rockingham Waste to Energy facility is one of two incinerators in WA. (Supplied: WMRR)\n\nThe technology proposed for the Parkes Energy Recovery plant is the same as the two sites in Western Australia.\n\nMr Nicholas said real-time \"emission monitoring\" data would be included as part of the project and publicly available for residents to view.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nPeter Tait is a member of the Public Health Association of Australia and was a clinical senior lecturer in population health at the Australian National University medical school.\n\nHe is also the author of a study that assessed reports linking older waste incinerators with a range of adverse health effects, such as cancer clusters and birth defects.\n\nDr Peter Tait says ingestion and inhalation are the main ways people are exposed to chemicals from waste to energy facilities. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nDr Tait said while the technology posed a low risk to human health, there was \"not no risk\".\n\n\"Old incinerators were quite toxin-producing so there is evidence of raised health outcomes including asthma, some cancers and some congenital abnormalities,\" he said.\n\n\"There are lots of toxic products produced, mostly dioxins as well as heavy metals.\"\n\nDr Tait said incinerators built in the past decade were \"assumed\" to be much safer due to technological developments and higher standards.\n\n\"These incinerators are so new it is not possible yet to say whether they are actually safer,\" he said.\n\nThe Parkes Shire Council is yet to form a position on the proposal, but Mayor Neil Westcott said avoiding any threat to human health was \"non-negotiable\".\n\nThe project will be assessed by the NSW Department of Planning.",

While break-even prices vary significantly between the basis, the rule of thumb is that they generally need something above $US60 a barrel to break even on new wells and $US65 a barrel or more to generate profits attractive enough to provide an incentive to drill. Oil prices have demonstrated acute sensitivity to Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies. After Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d global oil prices plummeted, with Brent crude tumbling from around $US75 a barrel to less than $US60 a barrel.

After Trump paused his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs and agreed a 90-day truce with China, with big cuts to the tariff rates, oil prices have recovered, with Brent trading around $US66 a barrel and WTI around $US62 a barrel. Not helping the position of the US producers is the impact on Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and steel products, cement and drilling fluids. A leading energy consultancy, Wood Mackenzie, says costs will have risen 4.5 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year as a result of those tariffs, which remain in place. The firm expects the cost of the steel pipes used in drilling, production and completion of wells to rise by 40 per cent and be the major contributor to the overall cost increases.\n\nSo, the \u201cprices down, costs up\u201d outlook will lead to less investment and less future production. That may be one of the objectives that the Saudi-led OPEC is pursuing. OPEC+ has embarked on a U-turn in its strategy this year. Oil prices have demonstrated acute sensitivity to Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies. Credit: AP For three years it restrained production. It took a total of about 6 million barrels a day of oil out of the market via production cutbacks over that period, with the Saudis bearing the brunt of those cutbacks \u2013 they contributed about 1 million of the 2.2 million barrels a day of \u201cvoluntary\u201d cutbacks announced in late 2023 for last year\u2019s production targets.\n\nThis year the cartel has started returning some of that curtailed production to the market. The original plan was to do it incrementally through to September next year. Instead, after announcing an increase in output of 38,000 barrels a day in April OPEC suddenly ramped that up to 411,000 barrels a day for May and then, earlier this month, announced a similar increase for June. In just over three months it will have added nearly half the volume that it had planned to add over 18 months. Loading The primary motivation for that increase, which has been led by the Saudis, is to respond to over-production from members of the cartel who haven\u2019t honoured their commitments -- Kazakhstan and Iraq in particular \u2013 and have produced at rates above their agreed caps. The Saudis, having shouldered the bulk of the burden of reduced production, have had enough and are prepared to live with the lower prices \u2013 well below the estimated $US90 a barrel or so needed to balance their budget \u2013 in exchange for the bigger volumes and the opportunity to discipline the recalcitrant members of the cartel.\n\nThe ancillary benefit is the impact it has on the US, where shale has made it the world\u2019s largest oil producer. Driving the prices down will, as its own forecasts suggest, drive some shale producers out of the market and lower the US industry\u2019s global market share, albeit that the shale sector is very flexible and innovative and has a greater ability to turn its production off and on than traditional producers. The 2014 oil price collapse, triggered by a big surge in OPEC supply, saw oil trade below $US30 a barrel. It ignited a wave of bankruptcies in the US shale sector. As soon as the price stabilised, however, production sprang back, with significantly lower costs. Trump\u2019s trade war, even if its severity is scaled back after the 90-day pauses on the reciprocal tariffs and China end, is depressing both global economic activity and the growth rate of the US economy. The US economy grew 2.8 per cent last year. OPEC is forecasting growth of only 1.7 per cent this year.\n\nDespite that lower growth in prospect, OPEC, pointing to last weekend\u2019s temporary truce between the US and China, says there is potential for more lasting agreements and a normalisation of trade flows, albeit at potentially elevated tariff levels compared to the pre-Liberation Day escalation of trade hostilities. Loading Nevertheless, it has left its forecasts for the increase in global oil demand this year unchanged at 1.3 million barrels a day and downgraded them only slightly, to 1.218 million barrels a day, for next year. By comparison, the International Energy Agency has forecast an increase of only 726,000 barrels a day. If the US and the non-OPEC producers don\u2019t reduce their output heavily this year, OPEC+ producers continue to unwind their production cuts at the current rate and the impact of the US trade policies continue to chill global economic activity, there is a very real prospect of as glut of oil developing and another big slump in prices. Trump will get his lower prices in those circumstances, which would help modestly offset the impact of his tariffs on inflation. What he wouldn\u2019t get is the boom in the shale oil sector that was supposed to be a key plank in his economic strategy.",

Brittain coaches the Blues to fifth spot.

        "text": "Walls was born in Dunolly, in western Victoria, and was attending Coburg High School, in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs, when he was spotted by Carlton. His arrival at the club coincided with Ron Barassi\u2019s first stint as a captain-coach. Walls\u2019 refusal to take prisoners was a direct result of his master\u2019s tutelage. Loading It made for a career that included its share of controversies, feuds and fallings-out. But Walls was never one to hold back. He booted a goal with his first kick, before securing his place in defence, where his long arms and aerial judgment were put to good use. In 1969, with a bit more meat on his bones, he returned to centre half-forward. The following year, Walls was critical as Carlton stormed home to steal the premiership cup from Collingwood. But it was his performance in the 1972 grand final that will stand forever. With captain-coach John Nicholls orchestrating a shootout with Richmond, Walls was supreme in the highest-scoring grand final in VFL/AFL history. Nicholls kicked six goals that day, and Alex Jesaulenko seven.\n\nAlthough the Norm Smith Medal had yet to be introduced, Walls was the unanimous choice as best afield, with six goals from 24 possessions, including a withering burst early in the second quarter that took the game away from the Tigers. Walls played 218 matches for Carlton and added another 41 for Fitzroy (1978-80) for a total of 259 games, in which he kicked 444 goals. John Elliott was president and Robert Walls was coach when Carlton won the 1987 VFL premiership. Credit: The Age In 1981, he began coaching Fitzroy while teaching at Park Orchards Primary School; the game was still only semi-professional. Walls quickly proved an astute thinker and tireless standard-bearer. \u201cHe was extraordinary, he was ahead of his time, and he changed all our lives,\u201d said former Fitzroy tagger Scott Clayton, who later worked under Walls as director of football at the Brisbane Bears.\n\nAfter finishing bottom of the ladder in 1980, the financially ailing Fitzroy rebounded under Walls, making the finals in three of his five years at the helm with emerging and established champions including Bernie Quinlan, Garry Wilson, Gary Pert and Paul Roos. At the end of 1985, Carlton sacked coach David Parkin. Walking out of Seven\u2019s studios after an interview, Parkin bumped into the man who had been appointed to replace him. It was Walls. The pair were swapping jobs, with Parkin taking over at Fitzroy. Carlton greats Robert Walls, Stephen Kernahan and David Rhys-Jones in 2017, marking the 30-year anniversary of their 1987 premiership win. Credit: Joe Armao Walls suggested the pair catch up for a yarn. \u201cI must admit I wasn\u2019t terribly concerned about spending time with him at that stage,\u201d Parkin chuckled. But over the next few hours, Walls astonished him by taking him through Fitzroy\u2019s entire list in detail. Parkin returned the favour. It was a collegiate gesture, unthinkable today, that benefited both men and cemented a lifelong friendship. Parkin, a four-time premiership coach, regards his first year at Fitzroy, 1986, as his finest coaching performance, when the Lions made the preliminary final.\n\nIt was Fitzroy\u2019s last gasp as a competition contender. They were beaten in the preliminary final by Hawthorn, who would in turn beat Carlton under Walls in the grand final. But the Blues turned the tables in 1987, winning the premiership and confirming Walls\u2019 stature as a Carlton immortal. In a famous move, Walls battled his match committee to play the feisty David Rhys-Jones, normally a winger or flanker, on Hawthorn\u2019s equally pugnacious centre half-forward Dermott Brereton. It worked: Rhys-Jones kept Brereton goalless and won the Norm Smith Medal. Robert Walls (centre) ventured north in 1991 to coach the Brisbane Bears. Credit: Mike Lader Celebrations were brief. Only a fortnight later, Carlton played an infamous exhibition match against North Melbourne in London, the so-called \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d. Most of the Blues were still hungover, and the two sides brawled senselessly in the supposed friendly. Later, Walls castigated club president John Elliott, the beer baron whose Carlton and United Breweries had sponsored the event. Blues chief executive (and Walls\u2019 former teammate) Ian Collins was furious. This time, Walls knew his willingness to speak his mind would come back to bite him.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long. Carlton crashed out of the 1988 finals with losses to Hawthorn and Melbourne. Walls berated his troops in the aftermath, and lost them for good. He was sacked the following season after Carlton lost eight of their first 10 games. \u201cI was too hard on the players, in hindsight,\u201d he told News Limited\u2019s Sacked podcast in 2019. \u201cI drove them relentlessly hard; I was looking for fault, more than I was to give them a pat on the back. I was too brutal, too uncompromising.\u201d Walls celebrates the 1987 grand final win with wife Erin. Credit: Craig Abraham Walls went to the Brisbane Bears in 1991. That year, he exposed a 21-year-old recruit, Shane Strempel, to a boxing session against eight of his teammates. It stopped only when star player Brad Hardie intervened. \u201cWe\u2019d better stop or we\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he told the coach. It was a stain on Walls\u2019 career, but his time at a club that was derided as the \u201cbad-news Bears\u201d was arguably his most influential. In 1995, he dragged a team featuring Michael Voss, Jason Akermanis, Nigel Lappin, Justin Leppitsch and Craig McRae into the finals for the first time.\n\nRobert Walls relaxing later in life with his dog Gus. Ironically, they were knocked out by the all-conquering Carlton, again coached by Parkin. \u201cWe talk about the [Ted] Whittens and the Barassis of the world, but I think Rob was a leader, up with the great coaches that came before and after him,\u201d Parkin said of his old friend. If his man-management style was of the old school, Walls was tactically innovative. One signature set play was the kick-in huddle, where players would cluster at centre-half-back, then burst into space. Parkin eventually introduced the zone defence to counter it. When Walls\u2019 coaching career finished, he was quickly in demand as an analyst. As usual, his candour led to clashes. He sparred with Sydney coach Paul Roos, declaring his former pupil\u2019s Swans couldn\u2019t possibly win the flag in 2005. They did. Walls later sought unsuccessfully to apologise to Roos. In print and on air, Walls was straight to the point and unsparing. \u201cWe always wondered when the sledgehammer was coming out,\u201d Lane remembers. \u201cBut it\u2019s not something he would have done lightly, there was a sense of duty and professionalism about the way he went about it.\u201d",

Credit: Getty Images That Walls would die soon, at a time of his choosing, was known to many of his friends within the football and media fraternities. A number of former Carlton teammates, and players he coached at Carlton, Fitzroy and the Brisbane Bears, visited him in his final weeks and embraced him for the last time. Paul Roos, the former Fitzroy champion for whom Walls was a seminal influence, flew from Hawaii to see Walls last week, while ex-Brisbane great Michael \u201cMagic\u201d McLean travelled from Darwin to see his old coach for the last time. Carlton teammates Peter \u201cPercy\u201d Jones and Geoff Southby visited him in recent days, as did his 1987 premiership player David Rhys-Jones and prominent football journalist Mike Sheahan. Scott Clayton, who played under Walls at Fitzroy and then was persuaded to join the coach in Brisbane as a recruiter/list manager for several years, said that outside of his family, Walls \u201chas been the greatest influence on my life\u201d. Clayton added: \u201cHe supported, he believed in you as person.\u201d\n\nLoading David Barham, the television executive and current Essendon president who hired Walls as a panellist on Seven\u2019s ground-breaking Talking Footy show and then enlisted him to Ten\u2019s commentary team, said of his close friend: \u201cI\u2019ll miss him a lot. He was one of the best people I\u2019ve met in my life.\u201d Walls was, in Clayton\u2019s words, \u201cfrank and fearless with the truth, honest to a fault\u201d \u2013 a description consistent with that of anyone who dealt with him as coach or commentator. This renowned candour was reflected in the often searing columns he wrote for The Age and in the expert comments he delivered on radio and television. It was this trait that prompted Barham to enlist Walls in the Essendon coach selection process that settled on Brad Scott in 2022. \u201cI knew he would tell me the truth,\u201d said Barham. \u201cI knew what I would get was factual and truthful, and he wouldn\u2019t be swayed by anyone.\u201d\n\nCarlton\u2019s Stephen Kernahan and Robert Walls with the \u201987 premiership cup. Barham, Clayton, David Walls (who is head of player personnel for Fremantle), McLean, and ex-Carlton and Melbourne Cricket Club chief executive Stephen Gough will speak at a celebration of Walls\u2019 life at the MCG, as he requested. A key member of Carlton\u2019s storied 1968, 1970 and 1972 premiership teams, and a star centre half-forward, Walls was a school teacher who turned to coaching after ending his playing days with Fitzroy. He became an innovative coach with the Lions, where he pioneered the use of \u201cthe huddle\u201d at kick-ins and established close bonds with players. These included Clayton, the late Matthew Rendell, Mick Conlan, future coaches Roos and Ross Lyon and several others. Walls coached the impecunious yet spirited Fitzroy to finals in 1981, 1983 and 1984, and returned to Carlton, as prodigal son, in the famed coach swap with David Parkin (who went from Carlton to Fitzroy) after 1985.\n\nArriving alongside boom recruits Stephen Kernahan, Craig Bradley, Peter Motley and Jon Dorotich, the tactically adroit Walls coached the Blues to a grand final in his first season (1986) and then delivered a premiership to Princes Park in 1987. After missing the grand final in 1988 (third), the Blues slumped in 1989, prompting the mid-season sacking of Walls by the ruthless regime of (president) John Elliott and (chief executive) Ian Collins. Hired by the Brisbane Bears after 1990 when that dysfunctional club was a font of ridicule, Walls is credited with building a platform for a team that, as the Lions (post-merger with Fitzroy), became one of the greatest in competition history, winning a treble of flags in 2001-03 under Leigh Matthews. Walls (centre) at Brisbane Bears training in 1993. While he bequeathed a greatly improved and talented team at Brisbane after 1995, Walls found controversy when it emerged that he had authorised the pummelling, in the boxing ring, of player Shane Strempel as a disciplinary measure in 1991. He later wrote about it for The Age.\n\nWalls playing for Carlton in 1970. Credit: The Age He also wrote with powerful insight about some of football\u2019s modern greats, including Nathan Buckley, Michael Voss and Jason Akermanis, all of whom he coached at the Bears. It says much about the scale of Walls\u2019 career that his ill-fated and brief stint coaching Richmond (1996-97) is a footnote to his other achievements. In addition to his coaching and commentary, Walls mentored coaches such as Lyon and Roos and was instrumental, as a coach-search panel member, in the Saints hiring Lyon in 2006, and in the Bulldogs\u2019 appointment of Rodney Eade (2004). Walls\u2019 formative coach was the great Ron Barassi, who had sought permission from Walls\u2019 mother to select the skinny 16-year-old for his first game for the Blues in 1967 because Walls\u2019 father had just died.\n\n\u201cHe was a god to us,\u201d Walls said of Barassi when he died in 2023, aged 87. Recruited from Coburg Amateurs locally, Walls absorbed the precepts of team-first discipline from Barassi and later cited his coach as influential in his emphasis on attacking, risk-taking football. Loading Graceful, mobile, rugged, and skilled for 193 centimetres, Walls was an exceptional player for the Blues, booting 367 goals in 218 games; judged best afield in the 1972 grand final, when he booted six goals, Walls would have likely won the Norm Smith Medal had the award existed then. Crossing to Fitzroy in 1978, he added 41 games for an aggregate of 259 matches and 444 goals. He is survived by his three children, seven grandchildren, and sister Annette.",

        "text": "Safety concerns, a weak dollar, and border security are some of the issues reportedly contributing to a drop in Australians travelling to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent media reports have suggested Australians are turning away from US travel, with data indicating fewer are visiting and planning trips compared with previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) paint a different picture, and experts say current statistics should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, are Australians really turning away from US travel, and what are the factors playing a part?\n\n\n\nHow many Australians are travelling to the US?\n\nAccording to preliminary data from the US government's International Trade Administration, there were 59,859 Australian visitors to the US in March. That's a 7.1 per cent drop from March last year, when 64,418 Australians visited the US. The Easter holiday period also fell in March in 2024 while this year, it was in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year to date, 201,867 Australians have arrived in the US, according to the data. That's about 1,500 fewer people than the corresponding period last year.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The ID change that's expected to delay people travelling in the US\n\nBut according to the latest data from the ABS, travel to the US appears to have slightly increased. The ABS' short-term resident returns for March 2025 tracked 55,870 Australians returning from the US, up from 50,650 for the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Sarah Gardiner, director of the Griffith Institute for Tourism, said the difference in numbers is likely due to different methods of data collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of our ABS data is done by our arrivals card, so when people come in through our entry points, international airports and so forth, it is tracked through that methodology,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they're [the US] using different types of tracking, maybe survey data or other data sources, there can be some variability in the data.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGardiner said the March travel data is not an accurate reflection of current issues.\n\n\n\nAs well as the data already being months old, those travelling in March would likely have booked their trips much earlier, without knowing about current issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Things are changing quite quickly in terms of the situation, and so you've got a bit of forward booking in that system as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's where it goes over the next few months that will be quite interesting to see if there is any impact.\"\n\n\n\nAre Australians less interested in travelling to the US?\n\nA national survey of 1,509 Australians aged 18 to 65 indicates fewer people were planning a trip to the US from 15 March to 15 May than the corresponding period 12 months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quarterly poll, commissioned by the Tourism and Transport Forum, had the US as the fifth most popular international destination for autumn 2024, with 8 per cent of travellers headed there.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US slid to seventh on the list for this autumn, scooping up less than 6 per cent of Australia's overseas travel market.\n\n\n\nSara Dolnicar, professor of tourism at the University of Queensland Business School, said she expects the numbers will rebound relatively quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nDolnicar said tourists are \"very reactive\" to world events and often base travel decisions around factors such as currency exchange rates, safety or security concerns, and environmental issues, particularly when travelling to far-away places like the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Travel is about adventure, but controlled adventure, so you don't want to really expose yourself to unnecessary risk,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Australians) might just be saying 'right now it doesn't seem stable enough for me to drag my family across there and not knowing what's going to happen',\".\n\n\n\nShe believes many Australians remain interested in travelling to the US, but may delay visiting until they feel more secure, particularly those who are putting trips off due to financial concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tourism is exceptionally resilient,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My prediction ... is that it will bounce back because these are not dreams given up. They are deferred dreams or deferred aspirations of people.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are the factors influencing Australian travel to the US?\n\nDean Long, CEO of the Australian Travel Industry Association, said he believes interest in travel to the US has dropped in recent months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The priced product in the US is very high when compared to the value that you can get across Southeast Asia in particular and even parts of Europe,\" he told the Australian Associated Press in April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think currency and value are the two things that are really driving that.\"\n\n\n\nThe exchange rate for the Australian dollar last week fell below 60 US cents, its lowest level since April 2020, following US President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a briefing, Tourism Economics, a division of the United Kingdom-based economics advisory firm Oxford Economics, said policies and pronouncements from the Trump administration were contributing to a growing wave of negative international traveller sentiment toward the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Heightened border security measures and visible immigration enforcement actions are amplifying concerns,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These factors, combined with a strong US dollar, are creating additional barriers for those considering travel to the US.\"\n\n\n\nIs the US tourism industry in trouble?\n\nAccording to the US International Trade Administration data, visitor numbers from countries other than Australia are also declining.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the dataset, the United Kingdom \u2014 the US's top tourism-generating country \u2014 had a 14.3 per cent decrease in visitors compared with the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany recorded a 28.2 per cent decrease, while the number of visitors from Spain and Ireland dropped by 24.6 per cent and 26.9 per cent respectively.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian tourists are outspending everyone else on one thing overseas\n\nDolnicar said these reductions could be concerning for the US tourism industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you think about the tourism industry ... globally it's about one in 10 jobs that's funded by the tourism industry and it's about 10 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product),\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if you have that kind of drop of numbers, that has immediate economic implications for a country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome countries recorded modest increases, including Japan, Brazil and Italy, with rises of 3.6 per cent, 6.1 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points More Australians refinanced their homes in the March quarter compared to the December quarter.\n\nChanges to the cash rate can give borrowers more negotiating power with lenders looking to be competitive.\n\nThe average loan size for owner-occupier dwellings dropped in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe number of Australians refinancing their home loans increased in the first quarter of the year, and now could be a great opportunity to consider your options, a finance expert says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 65,030 home loans were refinanced between lenders in the March quarter, an increase of 5.1 per cent on the previous three months.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, the data insights director at financial comparison website Canstar, said refinancing can become popular after an interest rate cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We often see an uptick in refinancing after a cash rate cut. That's why we saw this refinancing burden during the period of the 13 rate hikes when banks were fighting for your business,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of that refinancing activity is likely as a result of that cash rate cut in February.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will meet again next Tuesday, where it will announce any changes to the cash rate target, which sits at 4.1 per cent .\n\n\n\n'Pick up the phone to your bank'\n\nTindall said rate cuts bring mortgages front of mind for customers who are more likely to shop around for alternative lenders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the next four days or so, right now even, is a fantastic time to pick up the phone to your bank and haggle for a personalised cut,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you can renegotiate before a potential RBA cut next Tuesday ... you are then giving yourself a double cut if you're on a variable rate.\"\n\n\n\nIt would be up to the banks whether or not they pass along the savings, but historically, the vast majority do , according to Tindall.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing research ahead of time on the offerings of different banks can be a \"bargaining chip\" in negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Three of the big four banks are now offering an advertised lowest variable rate of 5.84 per cent. Use that as your benchmark if you are paying more,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall said it's important to be aware of any switching costs or caveats around home loans, and that it can take up to six weeks to process, but the savings can be worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many people, even in the first year or two, the savings you could potentially make would outweigh the effort and the cost of refinancing,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAverage loan sizes fall\n\nThe ABS lending indicators data also showed the number of loan commitments for dwellings fell in the first three months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the March quarter there were 127,108 loan commitments, a 3.5 per cent drop from the previous quarter. The value of the loan commitments fell by 1.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of new owner-occupier loan commitments for dwellings fell 3.4 per cent in the quarter while the value fell 2.5 per cent.\n\n\n\nThese loans were also on average $6,000 less than in the December quarter, sitting at $660,00 for March 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, loan sizes rose in every state and territory when compared to March 2024, with a national average increase of 8.37 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest change was in South Australia, which experienced a rise of 14.32 per cent, and at the opposite end of the scale loan sizes in the ACT rose by just 3.35 per cent.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Tindall said these figures were healthy considering the interest rate pressures borrowers have been under.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would expect that the new lending data is likely to pick up potentially as soon as the next quarter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

Oh what I do for the Crown Prince. The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served as an important function at the time. But now it's their time to shine. It's their time to shine. We're taking them all off. So I say, good luck, Syria, show us something very special.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump's announcement came shortly before he was set to meet with new Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, the onetime insurgent who led a rebel offensive that overthrew longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe developments are a major boost for the Syrian leader who at one point was imprisoned in Iraq for his role in the insurgency following the 2003 U-S-led invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosemary Kelanic is Director of the Middle East program at U-S think tank, Defense Priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says lifting the sanctions could help Syria achieve stability after decades of conflict and dictatorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a humanitarian reason to want the sanctions to be lifted, which is that the people of Syria have suffered under the sanctions. They've suffered from natural disasters in the past few years. There was an earthquake not very long ago, and levels of poverty are extremely high. So, if you want Syria to be able to make it as a country and not fall apart into a renewed civil war, it makes sense that you would want sanctions to be lifted and to have a chance to work with Syria's leaders to try to bring that about.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in Syrian capital Damascus, local residents are celebrating the move.\n\n\n\n\n\nVOXPOP 1: \"It is a very positive step if this really happens, and we hope for the best because the people are truly tired, and the conditions have been difficult in the past period. We hope for the best.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVOXPOP 2: \"We have been waiting for it for many years. It feels like a mountain has been lifted off our chest because now people may live more freely. I expect living conditions to improve in the future. It won't be immediate, but it will take some time. I believe this time has become a bit shorter. Congratulations to all of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump also used his visit to Saudi Arabia to urge Iran to make a new nuclear deal with the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he wants to avoid conflict with their geopolitical rival but warned that time is running out as Iran makes rapid progress with its nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even if our differences may be very profound, which obviously they are in the case of Iran, I have never believed in having permanent enemies. I want to make a deal with Iran. If I can make a deal with Iran, I'll be very happy if we're going to make your region and the world's a safer place. But if Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure, drive Iranian oil exports to zero, like I did before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while President Trump is set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to discuss oil and trade, investment deals, and regional conflicts, a notable absence from his schedule is longtime ally Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike a near-identical visit to the Middle East in his first presidential term in 2017, Mr Trump appears to have avoided meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this time around despite Israel standing on the brink of a sharp escalation of their war in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli government have proposed a plan to seize the entirety of Gaza and expel the Palestinian population, promising it will not begin until Mr Trump's visit to the region is over.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the US President's relationship with the Israeli leader appears to be up in the air, he made a point to encourage Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords and normalise its relationship with Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's my fervent hope, wish, and even my dream that Saudi Arabia will soon be joining the Abraham Accords. I think it'll be a tremendous tribute to your country. It will be a special day in the Middle East with the whole world watching when Saudi Arabia joins us but you'll do it in your own time. And that's what I want, and that's what you want, that's the way it's going to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are some limits to Mr Trump's close bond with Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "You note that adolescents naturally fall asleep later, meaning school starts far too early? Teenagers have been lumbered with this incessant chronic sleep debt, and if you look at models throughout the world where school start times are delayed, attendance rates increase and truancy rates decrease, while academic grades increase and psychiatric referrals decrease. I don\u2019t mean to trivialise things \u2013 getting children to school is not easy, and parents have to get to work \u2013 but if you look at the data, when sleep is abundant, minds flourish, and when it is not, they don\u2019t.\n\nBarack Obama says he can survive on five hours of sleep . Nikola Tesla was said to exist on three. Is there any optimal amount? It\u2019s seven to nine hours. Chronically sleeping less than seven hours is associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immune and inflammation issues, cancer, hormonal issues and, of course, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. There is a very small subset of the population that we now call \u201cnatural short sleepers\u201d, but statistically you\u2019re more likely to be struck by lightning.\n\nI love a good nap. So did Thomas Edison, right? Edison understood the creative brilliance of sleep and used it ruthlessly as a tool. He was also a habitual napper who would wake up and then write down all of the ideas he was getting. He called it \u201cthe genius gap\u201d: [the short phase] between lucid, waking consciousness and the depths of non-conscious, deep sleep. It\u2019s probably one of the reasons why no one\u2019s ever said you really should stay awake on a problem.\n\nWhy do we sleep? Twenty years ago, the crass answer was, \u201cWe sleep to cure sleepiness\u201d, which is the fatuous equivalent of saying, \u201cI eat to cure hunger.\u201d Now we ask, \u201cIs there any major physiological system of your body or any operation of your mind that isn\u2019t wonderfully enhanced by sleep when we get it, or demonstrably impaired when we don\u2019t get enough?\u201d And the answer seems to be no.\n\nHe calls himself a \u201chumble servant of this thing called slumber\u201d, but that would be selling British neuroscience professor Matthew Walker short. The author of Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, Walker is the expert of choice on one of life\u2019s great mysteries (and necessities).\n\nWhat purpose do dreams serve? Dreaming is almost like a form of informational alchemy. During dreaming, we start to collide all the recent things that we\u2019ve learnt with the back catalogue of information that we\u2019ve already got, and as a consequence we wake up with a revised mind: a wide web of associations that is capable of divining solutions to previously impenetrable problems. It\u2019s also a form of overnight therapy. With the special chemical cocktail that happens during dream sleep, it\u2019s almost like a nocturnal soothing balm, taking the sharp edges off those painful, difficult experiences. Dreaming strips the bitter emotional rind from the informational orange.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most common cause of insomnia? Sometimes I consider insomnia as the revenge of things we haven\u2019t worked through during the day: the stuff causing anxiety and stress. You have to get your mind off itself. How? First, meditation. Next, with what\u2019s called a body scan, relaxing as you focus on each part of your body from head to toe. If you don\u2019t like the sound of that, try box breathing: inhale for five seconds, hold it for five seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. Another thing that you can do is take yourself on a mental walk down the street in 4K hyper-vivid detail. Do not count sheep.\n\nLoading\n\nWhat are your top tips for good sleep? Try to stay away from too much caffeine in the afternoon and limit your alcohol use, because it will fragment your sleep. Your bedroom temperature should be cool: about 17 to 18 degrees. As for unconventional tips, set an alarm for one hour before you expect to go to bed, then shut down all the lights in your house. You will be stunned by how sleepy and soporific that will make you feel. In that same hour before bed, try to limit the use of devices \u2013 not because of the blue light but because they hit the mute button on your sleepiness and cause what\u2019s called \u201csleep procrastination\u201d. Also, go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time. I know it sounds desperately pedestrian, remarkably vanilla and deeply boring, but if you want to sleep, regularity is your first best step.\n\nDo we undervalue sleep? We are still in the mentality of competitive under-sleeping, and whoever the PR agent for sleep has been, we probably should have fired them long ago because there\u2019s a terrible stigma about getting sufficient sleep, which is strange. No one looks at an infant sleeping during the day and says, \u201cWhat a lazy baby\u201d, but we do that to adults. Don\u2019t think of sleep as a cost to today; sleep is an investment in tomorrow.\n\nProfessor Matthew Walker will be speaking at the Sydney Town Hall on May 27, as part of Vivid and the Sydney Writers\u2019 Festival.\n\nTo read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.",

        "text": "The US onshore oil sector is particularly sensitive to oil prices. While break-even prices vary significantly between the basis, the rule of thumb is that they generally need something above $US60 a barrel to break even on new wells and $US65 a barrel or more to generate profits attractive enough to provide an incentive to drill. Oil prices have demonstrated acute sensitivity to Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies. After Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d global oil prices plummeted, with Brent crude tumbling from around $US75 a barrel to less than $US60 a barrel. The US domestic price, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), fell to as low as $US55 a barrel. After Trump paused his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs and agreed a 90-day truce with China, with big cuts to the tariff rates, oil prices have recovered, with Brent trading around $US66 a barrel and WTI around $US62 a barrel. Not helping the position of the US producers is the impact on Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and steel products, cement and drilling fluids. A leading energy consultancy, Wood Mackenzie, says costs will have risen 4.5 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year as a result of those tariffs, which remain in place. The firm expects the cost of the steel pipes used in drilling, production and completion of wells to rise by 40 per cent and be the major contributor to the overall cost increases.\n\nSo, the \u201cprices down, costs up\u201d outlook will lead to less investment and less future production. That may be one of the objectives that the Saudi-led OPEC is pursuing. OPEC+ has embarked on a U-turn in its strategy this year. Oil prices have demonstrated acute sensitivity to Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies. Credit: AP For three years it restrained production. It took a total of about 6 million barrels a day of oil out of the market via production cutbacks over that period, with the Saudis bearing the brunt of those cutbacks \u2013 they contributed about 1 million of the 2.2 million barrels a day of \u201cvoluntary\u201d cutbacks announced in late 2023 for last year\u2019s production targets.\n\nThis year the cartel has started returning some of that curtailed production to the market. The original plan was to do it incrementally through to September next year. Instead, after announcing an increase in output of 38,000 barrels a day in April OPEC suddenly ramped that up to 411,000 barrels a day for May and then, earlier this month, announced a similar increase for June. In just over three months it will have added nearly half the volume that it had planned to add over 18 months. Loading The primary motivation for that increase, which has been led by the Saudis, is to respond to over-production from members of the cartel who haven\u2019t honoured their commitments -- Kazakhstan and Iraq in particular \u2013 and have produced at rates above their agreed caps. The Saudis, having shouldered the bulk of the burden of reduced production, have had enough and are prepared to live with the lower prices \u2013 well below the estimated $US90 a barrel or so needed to balance their budget \u2013 in exchange for the bigger volumes and the opportunity to discipline the recalcitrant members of the cartel.\n\nThe ancillary benefit is the impact it has on the US, where shale has made it the world\u2019s largest oil producer. Driving the prices down will, as its own forecasts suggest, drive some shale producers out of the market and lower the US industry\u2019s global market share, albeit that the shale sector is very flexible and innovative and has a greater ability to turn its production off and on than traditional producers. The 2014 oil price collapse, triggered by a big surge in OPEC supply, saw oil trade below $US30 a barrel. It ignited a wave of bankruptcies in the US shale sector. As soon as the price stabilised, however, production sprang back, with significantly lower costs. Trump\u2019s trade war, even if its severity is scaled back after the 90-day pauses on the reciprocal tariffs and China end, is depressing both global economic activity and the growth rate of the US economy. The US economy grew 2.8 per cent last year. OPEC is forecasting growth of only 1.7 per cent this year.\n\nDespite that lower growth in prospect, OPEC, pointing to last weekend\u2019s temporary truce between the US and China, says there is potential for more lasting agreements and a normalisation of trade flows, albeit at potentially elevated tariff levels compared to the pre-Liberation Day escalation of trade hostilities. Loading Nevertheless, it has left its forecasts for the increase in global oil demand this year unchanged at 1.3 million barrels a day and downgraded them only slightly, to 1.218 million barrels a day, for next year. By comparison, the International Energy Agency has forecast an increase of only 726,000 barrels a day. If the US and the non-OPEC producers don\u2019t reduce their output heavily this year, OPEC+ producers continue to unwind their production cuts at the current rate and the impact of the US trade policies continue to chill global economic activity, there is a very real prospect of as glut of oil developing and another big slump in prices. Trump will get his lower prices in those circumstances, which would help modestly offset the impact of his tariffs on inflation. What he wouldn\u2019t get is the boom in the shale oil sector that was supposed to be a key plank in his economic strategy.",

Brittain coaches the Blues to fifth spot.

        "text": "Walls was born in Dunolly, in western Victoria, and was attending Coburg High School, in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs, when he was spotted by Carlton. His arrival at the club coincided with Ron Barassi\u2019s first stint as a captain-coach. Walls\u2019 refusal to take prisoners was a direct result of his master\u2019s tutelage. Loading It made for a career that included its share of controversies, feuds and fallings-out. But Walls was never one to hold back. He booted a goal with his first kick, before securing his place in defence, where his long arms and aerial judgment were put to good use. In 1969, with a bit more meat on his bones, he returned to centre half-forward. The following year, Walls was critical as Carlton stormed home to steal the premiership cup from Collingwood. But it was his performance in the 1972 grand final that will stand forever. With captain-coach John Nicholls orchestrating a shootout with Richmond, Walls was supreme in the highest-scoring grand final in VFL/AFL history. Nicholls kicked six goals that day, and Alex Jesaulenko seven.\n\nAlthough the Norm Smith Medal had yet to be introduced, Walls was the unanimous choice as best afield, with six goals from 24 possessions, including a withering burst early in the second quarter that took the game away from the Tigers. Walls played 218 matches for Carlton and added another 41 for Fitzroy (1978-80) for a total of 259 games, in which he kicked 444 goals. John Elliott was president and Robert Walls was coach when Carlton won the 1987 VFL premiership. Credit: The Age In 1981, he began coaching Fitzroy while teaching at Park Orchards Primary School; the game was still only semi-professional. Walls quickly proved an astute thinker and tireless standard-bearer. \u201cHe was extraordinary, he was ahead of his time, and he changed all our lives,\u201d said former Fitzroy tagger Scott Clayton, who later worked under Walls as director of football at the Brisbane Bears.\n\nAfter finishing bottom of the ladder in 1980, the financially ailing Fitzroy rebounded under Walls, making the finals in three of his five years at the helm with emerging and established champions including Bernie Quinlan, Garry Wilson, Gary Pert and Paul Roos. At the end of 1985, Carlton sacked coach David Parkin. Walking out of Seven\u2019s studios after an interview, Parkin bumped into the man who had been appointed to replace him. It was Walls. The pair were swapping jobs, with Parkin taking over at Fitzroy. Carlton greats Robert Walls, Stephen Kernahan and David Rhys-Jones in 2017, marking the 30-year anniversary of their 1987 premiership win. Credit: Joe Armao Walls suggested the pair catch up for a yarn. \u201cI must admit I wasn\u2019t terribly concerned about spending time with him at that stage,\u201d Parkin chuckled. But over the next few hours, Walls astonished him by taking him through Fitzroy\u2019s entire list in detail. Parkin returned the favour. It was a collegiate gesture, unthinkable today, that benefited both men and cemented a lifelong friendship. Parkin, a four-time premiership coach, regards his first year at Fitzroy, 1986, as his finest coaching performance, when the Lions made the preliminary final.\n\nIt was Fitzroy\u2019s last gasp as a competition contender. They were beaten in the preliminary final by Hawthorn, who would in turn beat Carlton under Walls in the grand final. But the Blues turned the tables in 1987, winning the premiership and confirming Walls\u2019 stature as a Carlton immortal. In a famous move, Walls battled his match committee to play the feisty David Rhys-Jones, normally a winger or flanker, on Hawthorn\u2019s equally pugnacious centre half-forward Dermott Brereton. It worked: Rhys-Jones kept Brereton goalless and won the Norm Smith Medal. Robert Walls (centre) ventured north in 1991 to coach the Brisbane Bears. Credit: Mike Lader Celebrations were brief. Only a fortnight later, Carlton played an infamous exhibition match against North Melbourne in London, the so-called \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d. Most of the Blues were still hungover, and the two sides brawled senselessly in the supposed friendly. Later, Walls castigated club president John Elliott, the beer baron whose Carlton and United Breweries had sponsored the event. Blues chief executive (and Walls\u2019 former teammate) Ian Collins was furious. This time, Walls knew his willingness to speak his mind would come back to bite him.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long. Carlton crashed out of the 1988 finals with losses to Hawthorn and Melbourne. Walls berated his troops in the aftermath, and lost them for good. He was sacked the following season after Carlton lost eight of their first 10 games. \u201cI was too hard on the players, in hindsight,\u201d he told News Limited\u2019s Sacked podcast in 2019. \u201cI drove them relentlessly hard; I was looking for fault, more than I was to give them a pat on the back. I was too brutal, too uncompromising.\u201d Walls celebrates the 1987 grand final win with wife Erin. Credit: Craig Abraham Walls went to the Brisbane Bears in 1991. That year, he exposed a 21-year-old recruit, Shane Strempel, to a boxing session against eight of his teammates. It stopped only when star player Brad Hardie intervened. \u201cWe\u2019d better stop or we\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he told the coach. It was a stain on Walls\u2019 career, but his time at a club that was derided as the \u201cbad-news Bears\u201d was arguably his most influential. In 1995, he dragged a team featuring Michael Voss, Jason Akermanis, Nigel Lappin, Justin Leppitsch and Craig McRae into the finals for the first time.\n\nRobert Walls relaxing later in life with his dog Gus. Ironically, they were knocked out by the all-conquering Carlton, again coached by Parkin. \u201cWe talk about the [Ted] Whittens and the Barassis of the world, but I think Rob was a leader, up with the great coaches that came before and after him,\u201d Parkin said of his old friend. If his man-management style was of the old school, Walls was tactically innovative. One signature set play was the kick-in huddle, where players would cluster at centre-half-back, then burst into space. Parkin eventually introduced the zone defence to counter it. When Walls\u2019 coaching career finished, he was quickly in demand as an analyst. As usual, his candour led to clashes. He sparred with Sydney coach Paul Roos, declaring his former pupil\u2019s Swans couldn\u2019t possibly win the flag in 2005. They did. Walls later sought unsuccessfully to apologise to Roos. In print and on air, Walls was straight to the point and unsparing. \u201cWe always wondered when the sledgehammer was coming out,\u201d Lane remembers. \u201cBut it\u2019s not something he would have done lightly, there was a sense of duty and professionalism about the way he went about it.\u201d",

        "text": "The tension over boats and trailers on suburban streets is heating up again \u2014 and one Sydney council says it is being swamped with complaints.\n\nA Randwick resident complained that this trailer takes up too much space on the kerb. Source: Facebook/Geoff Surtees\n\nIt's an increasingly controversial question that attracts heated debate across Australia's suburbs \u2014 do trailers, caravans and boats belong on suburban streets?\n\nWith parking in the country's major cities often scarce, some residents argue trailers, boats and caravans take up critical space. In many reported cases, they're dumped in a location for weeks on end, adding to congestion and parking difficulties for locals.\n\nBut for boat owners, they're legally allowed to be parked outside an owner's home, or any location for that matter, for 28 days. However, those doing the wrong thing can pay the price, with one inner city local government area already dishing out $28,000 in fines for vehicles left for too long.\n\nIn Sydney, the issue is one that coastal residents are all too familiar with. This week, Randwick City Council told Yahoo News Australia rangers had been kept quite busy tending to reports of what residents claimed were unattended vehicles and trailers.\n\nOne boat owner was shocked to find an angry message painted onto its tarp in Freshwater recently. Source: Reddit.\n\nRandwick Council impounded 440 dumped trailers and vehicles\n\nOn Wednesday, a local man unleashed online over a boat parked on St Marks Road in Randwick. \"Why isn't council doing more to prevent this from happening?\" he complained online. \"This boat takes up 1.5 car spaces.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen asked by Yahoo News, the council said it is actively monitoring and removing trailers that have overstayed their welcome in its streets. \"State government rules allow owners of registered trailers to park their trailer legally on the street outside their home, and to park the trailer elsewhere for up to 28 days before moving it,\" a Randwick City spokesman told Yahoo.\n\n\"Rangers have investigated 932 suspected unattended vehicles in 2025, impounding 440 and issuing over $28,000 in fines.\"\n\nThe spokesman urged residents, if they believe a vehicle or trailer has remained unmoved in the same location for more than 28 days, to report it.\n\nIt's not the first time the council has targeted large vehicle owners. In December, it banned parking for almost five kilometres along a busy nature strip that had become \"increasingly popular for storage of boats, caravans and trailers\".\n\nBoat wars erupt across Sydney\n\nIn the city's north, a bitter neighbour war recently erupted over this exact issue, with the words \"f**k it off\" sprayed in bright red paint on a parked boat in Freshwater.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHitting back, the boat owner explained they had legally obtained a permit to park it there. \"The boat and trailer are registered, and we can thus park it legally in the street,\" they wrote in a response letter, which they taped to the boat.\n\n\"We live in the street and haven't just parked it here as it looks like a quiet spot. I have tried to be thoughtful... Hope you can understand and not graffiti or damage our family boat\".\n\nA person, who may or may not have been the original vandal, then responded to the letter with their own. \"If you do live in the street, park your boat on your drive, or out the front of your house,\" it said.\n\n\"Be a good neighbour, and not just someone who moved here recently.\" Understandably tired of the drama, the boat's owner then posted another \u2014 and presumably the last \u2014 letter to the community. It read: \"The boat will be moved in the next few days, please do not damage it or graffiti it\".\n\nDo you have a story tip?
