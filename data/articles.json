It was a really cool experience,\" Duursma told ABC Sport.\n\n\"I didn't quite understand at the time just how cool that was.\"\n\nZane now plays for North Melbourne, while their sister, Yasmin, 21, plays for Carlton in the AFLW, and youngest brother Willem, 17, is touted to go as high as number one in the next national draft.\n\nIf Willem is to be selected, the quartet will follow famous footy families in the Selwoods and Danihers with four siblings to play the game.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n'Bush to the Burbs'\n\nIt's memories from growing up in Foster - with a population of just over 2,000 located 175 kilometres outside of Melbourne - that makes this weekend's Country Game so special for Duursma.\n\n\"It's giving us the opportunity to show what can happen if you work hard as a country kid and a country footballer,\" Duursma said.\n\n\"And what you can achieve potentially, if you put your mind to it and you work hard.\"\n\nThe Country Game recognises the impact of the regions on the game.\n\nThis Saturday will be Essendon and Geelong's 10th edition of the annual Country Game clash at the MCG, which aims to recognise the impact of country footy on the game, and acknowledge the contribution of regional communities to Australian society.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Bush to the Burbs\".\n\nLast year, participation in Australian Rules Football exceeded more than 520,000, breaking the AFL's all-time registered participation record set the year prior.

(Getty: Michael Dodge)\n\nThe country builds character\n\nDuursma said the main challenge that country kids face in pursuing a footy career is travel, with many important games for pathways being in major cities.\n\n\"Then also sometimes there's facilities and things like that,\" Duursma said.\n\n\"But at the same time, I think that builds part of the character and the grit (that country kids have). That sometimes you go without, so you just kind of make do with what you got.\"\n\nYasmin (left), Xavier and Zane Duursma all grew up in Foster and now play at the top level. (Supplied)\n\nDuursma said there's pride that comes with being a country kid \"out in the middle of the sticks\", without access to all the things people in the city areas might have.\n\n\"So there is a bit of a chip on your shoulder,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think that to be able to come through (the system), and as a family with a number of brothers and sister (that) have done really well with themselves, we wear that kind of as a badge of honour.\n\n\"So I'm really, really proud of that. I think our families and communities are pretty proud of that too.\"\n\nHailing from the country, Xavier Duursma reached 100 games this weekend in the AFL. (Getty: Michael Willson/AFL Photos)\n\nWithout their parents, Dean and Susie, driving countless hours to get them to training or games, Duursma said he and his siblings would never have made it to the AFL.\n\n\"Sometimes, when you're a kid, you don't fully understand it, you don't fully grasp it, but when looking back at it now, it's incredible the amount of love, care and time that they put into us,\" he said.\n\nAnd country footy does have one advantage on the city.\n\n\"Don't tell my high performance staff but I don't mind the pies down there at Foster. They go pretty well - also the strawberry donuts,\" he said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

        "text": "Tonnes of plastic farm waste is being turned into new products with the development of recycling techniques by the agricultural industry and engineering researchers.\n\nEach year, Australian farms go through an estimated 110,000 tonnes of plastic waste, but recycling options for soft plastics and twine in particular are limited.\n\nKey players in Australia's grain industry unveiled a plan earlier this year to stop 45,000 tonnes of agricultural bags from going to landfill or being illegally incinerated.\n\nResearchers at a regional Victorian university have also helped to develop a machine to melt down synthetic hay binding twine and repurpose it into building products and furniture.\n\nA pile of synthetic hay bale twine that will be repurposed into furniture and building materials. (Supplied: La Trobe University)\n\n'Leap forward for sustainability'\n\nAn industry-led, not-for-profit program to collect and recycle plastic agricultural bags is underway in Victoria with plans to expand it in the coming years.\n\nThe bagMUSTER scheme is similar to the program used for chemical drums, allowing farmers to return their used soft plastic bags to stores for recycling.\n\nCropLife Australia chief executive Matthew Cossey helped develop the program and said the bags used for fertilisers, seeds, grain, stock feed, and pet food are turned into new agricultural products.\n\n\"It's a huge leap forward for farm recycling,\" he said.\n\nUnder the bagMUSTER program, farmers can return their agricultural bags for recycling. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\n\"When a farmer buys a product in the bagMUSTER program, they'll be able to return it to the retailer, and then it will be collected and fully recycled. It's as simple as that.\n\n\" It's critical for farming sustainability, for protecting our environment, improving recycling and it absolutely makes economic sense. \"\n\nTwine trouble\n\nPlastic cords used to bind hay, straw and other crops are often seen piling up in farmers' sheds, contaminated with soil, animal waste and other residues.\n\nMost of the twine ends up in landfill or is burnt on farms.\n\nLa Trobe University researchers in Bendigo have helped develop a machine to melt and re-form the twine into useful, durable products.\n\nEngineering Associate Professor Ing Kong said the twine could be turned into garden planters, outdoor furniture, and construction materials such as decking or fence posts.\n\n\"There has been no incentive to recycle bale twine because it is a single-use, bulky and contaminated product with dirt, small rocks and such,\" Dr Kong said.\n\n\"But this particular machine, invented by Rtech, can actually take a significant amount of contaminate and still process it.\"\n\nIng Kong says the melting machine is a cost-effective way to recycle plastic twine. (Supplied: La Trobe University)\n\nDr Kong said the melting machine was much more cost-effective than comparable machines and was designed so it could be used on-farm.\n\n\"It can be owned and installed easily by anyone, it's economical, and takes up a small space,\" she said.\n\n\"If a farmer has a constant amount of plastic waste, they can recycle it on site into 1-metre cubes, and have the waste ready to be manufactured either locally or exported.\"\n\nPlastic disposal a pain\n\nAustralian Seed Federation chief executive Katherine Delbridge said the disposal of plastic waste had long been a pain for farmers.\n\n\"We have plastic for a reason. It protects products. But we know we have a responsibility to do something with that plastic,\" she said.\n\nAgsafe's Matthew Cossey (middle) and Alicia Garden (left) with Australian Seed Federation's Katherine Delbridge. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\nMs Delbridge said the cost of disposing seed bags into landfill was prohibitive for many farmers.\n\n\"Because there hasn't been a supply chain for this plastic before the frank matter is people have been burying and burning this plastic on-farm.\"\n\nAgsafe general manager Alicia Garden welcomed the advancements in recycling but said there was still a long way to go.\n\n\"About 15,000 tonnes of soft plastic recycling is available across all industries per year \u2014 consumer, mining, agriculture. It's a really constrained bottleneck,\" she said.\n\nWoven polypropylene bags are often used to keep seed, feed and fertiliser fresh, but have limited disposal options. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Jo Prendergast)\n\n\"Regulatory change about 18 months ago means that we can't use recycling facilities overseas; we have to recycle here in Australia.\n\n\" I've heard estimates that 30\u201335 per cent of [some] regional landfill is full of bulka bags, woven polypropylene bags. That's why we chose this kind of plastic to go after. \"\n\nMs Garden said developers were now looking at ways to recycle other plastic waste on farms, such as silage wrap.\n\n\"There is a dedicated facility [for that] being built in Albury, which we expect will be online late this year or early next year,\" she said.",

        "text": "Australian veteran Adam Scott has suffered another dispiriting late lapse in his opening round at the US Open after a rousing early first-day effort at the fearsome Oakmont course.\n\nScott, leading the Aussie charge at the testing Pennsylvanian course, was right in the thick of the early hunt for the clubhouse lead overnight as, starting from the 10th hole, he reached the turn in two-under.\n\nBut dropped shots at the third and eighth holes \u2014 his 12th and 17th \u2014 dragged the 44-year-old back to level par, four shots adrift of the early pacesetter, American JJ Spaun, who recorded a superb bogey-free 66.\n\nAmong the early wave, Scott, competing in a remarkable 96th consecutive major championship dating back to the 2001 British Open, was still in a top-10 position as Oakmont began to bare its teeth.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nScott's round was a topsy-turvy affair from the start, as he recorded three bogeys and five birdies in his first nine holes, but as often has been the case in recent years, he was unable to prevent an accident-prone finale.\n\nYet the 2013 Masters champion still enjoyed a much better start than the current green jacket holder Rory McIlroy, who ended up eight shots back after a four-over 74.\n\nAustralia's \"two Cams\" both suffered disappointing starts, with Cameron Davis also shooting a 74, while Cameron Smith couldn't muster a single birdie in a 75 that featured five bogeys.\n\nMarc Leishman was the final Australian to play on Thursday, local time, starting from the 10th tee. Leishman struggled off the tee, hitting just three fairways in his round.\n\nTwo bogeys in his first five holes were then followed by birdies at the 15th (sixth hole played), second (11th hole played) and fourth (13th hole played) holes to be one-under.\n\nBut two bogeys and three pars to finish the round left Leishman with a one-over, 71.\n\nThe pre-tournament talk had been all about how challenging the Oakmont Country Club course would be but Spaun produced a remarkable effort, only the eighth bogey-free round ever in a US Open there.\n\nThe 34-year-old Spaun, who lost to McIlroy in a play-off at The Players Championship in March, recorded his lowest-ever round in a major in stifling early conditions.\n\nSouth Korean Kim Si-woo, whose birdie attempt at his final hole just missed, finished two shots off the pace while American Ben Griffin was a further shot adrift after mixing three birdies with two bogeys.\n\nSpaun, who started on the back nine, had a spectacular start reaching the turn with four birdies to become the first player ever to cover the first nine in the opening round of an Oakmont US Open in 31 strokes or fewer.\n\nThe most dramatic shot of the day was Patrick Reed's amazing second on the 621-yard fourth hole, which the former Masters champ holed from 286 yards for only the fourth albatross in US Open history, since records were kept from 1983.\n\nOthers to have recorded an albatross at the US Open were T.C. Chen (1985 at Oakland Hills), Shaun Micheel (2010 at Pebble Beach) and Nick Watney (2012 at Olympic).\n\nDefending champion Bryson DeChambeau, looking to become the first repeat US Open winner since Brooks Koepka in 2018, struggled in the penal rough to go around in 73.\n\nBut McIlroy's bright start, as he made two early birdies, ended up giving way to a wayward second nine as he made four bogeys over a seven-hole stretch.\n\nTournament favourite Scottie Scheffler was going out with the late starters alongside two-time major winner Collin Morikawa and European star Viktor Hovland.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC Gippsland: Danielle Pope)\n\nSky is the limit\n\nThe company is employing 43 full-time staff and seven apprentices.\n\nMr Morgan said the new GA8 airvans should be operational next year, but the company only had a third of the workforce needed to get the planes off the ground.\n\n\"It means jobs, jobs, jobs for the valley,\" Mr Morgan said.",

        "text": "Growing up, Amy Wang's father lovingly packed her lunch for school. And each day, she'd throw that lunch in the bin.\n\nThroughout her primary years, and even into high school, she remembers being embarrassed by the intricate Chinese meals.\n\n\"I'd get teased,\" the now 34-year-old says.\n\n\"I would beg for like, white bread, ham, cheese, Vegemite, just simple ingredients \u2014 like, give me spam!\n\n\"It sounds so weird but it was what I wanted because every other white kid had that.\"\n\nJoan Chen dreams of being just like cool-girl Olivia Hammond, who's played by real-life influencer Amelie Zilber. (Supplied: Sydney Film Festival)\n\nThe memory serves as the jumping-off point for her feature film debut, Slanted, which premiered at the Sydney Film Festival this week after winning the Narrative Jury Award at South by South West (SXSW) in Austin earlier this year.\n\nWang's now based in LA after moving to the States at 19, and is behind a string of projects, including the upcoming Crazy Rich Asians 2. But while she's set her satirical body horror in the US \u2014 with a notable cast of up-and-comers to boot \u2014 it's rooted in the racism and the struggle to belong that plagued her throughout her childhood in Sydney.\n\n\"In my early teens, I would think a lot about: 'Wouldn't life just be easier if I was white?'\n\n\"So, the concept [for the film] came from, 'OK, what if she gets what she wants? Then what happens?'\"\n\nFrom Duolingo to nose pegs\n\nSlanted sees Wang's morbid teenage dream come true, as aspiring prom queen Joan Huang (Shirley Chen) signs up for a radical surgery to change her race.\n\nSlanted takes racial transformation a step further than a peg on the nose. (Supplied: Sydney Film Festival)\n\nLike her protagonist, Wang moved to the West from China at seven years old, without speaking a word of English.\n\nShe moved primary schools five times, forced to make friends and fit in at each new school.\n\nShifting these experiences to an all-American setting was \"very entertaining\", and puts her debut in the realm of Hollywood classics like Mean Girls.\n\n\"It was fascinating as an outsider. I didn't know about [how US students] say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning. It's like: 'Are you guys in a cult?'\"\n\nPart body horror, part teen comedy, Slanted takes its satire to sci-fi extremes.\n\nPre-surgery, Joan tries everything to fit into the beauty standards of blonde idols like Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 using race-altering Instagram filters (which really do exist) and pegging her nose in an attempt to look less Chinese.\n\n\"The peg on the nose \u2014 I used to do it when I was in high school, trying to make it smaller and pointier, like a white person's nose,\" Wang says.\n\n\"I've had Asian girls or even African-American girls come up to me [after screenings] being like: 'I used to do that too!'\"\n\nSlanted's protagonist Joan soon becomes Jo, with the cast and director taking home the SXSW Narrative Jury Award. (Getty: Gilbert Flores)\n\nJoan gets the nose she's always dreamed of post-surgery when she transforms into another (white) person entirely: Jo Hunt. This new Joan is played by the increasingly noteworthy McKenna Grace, who spent months on Duolingo to nail the tonal intricacies of Mandarin.\n\nAs Jo distances herself from her old life, she soon discovers all the privileges of no longer being a minority: \"I don't have to be Asian-American, I can just be American.\"\n\nSatirising stereotypes\n\nWang didn't actually meet her dad, who emigrated ahead of her and her mum, until she moved to Australia at seven.\n\nBut the paternal role is central in the film as Joan is spoiled by her sweet, gentle father and showers him with affection in return, but pushes back against her mother's attempts to connect, in a show of peak teen angst.\n\n\"I feel like there are a lot of media portrayals of Asian men who are toxic gamblers and drunks,\" Wang says, adding that Asian women are often stereotyped as tiger mums.\n\n\" I think for me, what was important was to portray an Asian family who was supportive. \"\n\nAnd it's this familial bond that makes Joan's transformation \u2014 which her parents take as a rejection \u2014 all the more heartbreaking.\n\nAmy Wang has made her directorial debut with Slanted, a deeply personal satire based on her experiences of racism growing up in Australia. (Getty: Robby Klein)\n\nAs technology, plastic surgery, social media and AI move well beyond the nose peg of Wang's own teen years, she's fascinated by the way attitudes towards race are changing.\n\nFilm with no script wins major Berlin prize Photo shows Two young women sit under an iridescent sheet Fwends is a uniquely Australian story that follows two 20-somethings who travel interstate to revive their long-distance friendship.\n\n\"Nowadays, more than ever, a lot of Western beauty standards are actually imitating Asian beauty standards; cat-eye make-up, tanning and all of those things.\n\n\"It's really interesting to think about what that means, when you're rejecting the actual person of a Chinese Australian girl, but you're white and you're trying to emulate pieces of what she represents, getting the best of both worlds.\"\n\nWhile Slanted's transformative \"ethnic-modification surgery\" is hopefully still a long way off, TikTok is full of Asian influencers getting nose jobs, opting for a more Western look.\n\n\"When I was growing up, you had people like Britney Spears, but none of them had much work done, compared to today's role models,\" Wang says.\n\n\"There are so many more ways for girls to compare themselves to each other now.\"\n\nSlanted will screen on June 15 as part of the Sydney Film Festival, with an Australia-wide cinematic release yet to be confirmed.",

(ABC Upper Hunter: Sean Murphy)\n\n\"Most of the equipment was built [in the 1980s] and mainly stays the same \u2026 so we do need to fine-tune it,\" he said.\n\n\"Definitely, ageing plants can contribute to [higher prices], but I think it's more so just the fact that the energy industry is changing so much.\n\n\" There's a combination of things leading to higher prices, there's a necessary transition taking place. \"\n\nCase against extending 'expensive, improbable' coal-fired power Photo shows An aerial view of poweer station with two large smoke stacks Coal-fired power stations are unreliable and driving up electricity prices, according to a new report on the eve of a federal election campaign in which the viability of keeping plants going longer will be a key focus.\n\nBill hike\n\nA report from Reliability Watch using data supplied by power station operators to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) revealed how unreliable the power station was.\n\nOne of Bayswater's four units was completely offline from October 1, 2024, until February 19, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, there were nine other outages across the site's other three units between October and March.\n\nThe Australian Energy Regulator has warned NSW customers they are in for a hefty increase to their power bills of between 7.9 to 9.7 per cent from July 1.\n\nAEMO has linked increasing outages at ageing coal-fired power stations in the final quarter of 2024 to record-high wholesale prices.\n\nInstitute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis lead Australian electricity analyst Johanna Bowyer said that when power stations went offline for repairs and maintenance, more expensive forms of power, such as gas, were used to fill the gaps.\n\nJohanna Bowyer says the reliability of coal-fired power stations decreases significantly by the 40-year mark. (Supplied: IEEFA)\n\nShe said this pushed up wholesale electricity prices.\n\n\"In these periods of time when you have coal outages, that is often coinciding with higher wholesale power prices,\" she said.\n\nShift to renewables\n\nBayswater has provided about 20 per cent of NSW's electricity over the past four decades.\n\nBut at Bayswater's age, Ms Bowyer said its days were numbered.\n\n\"We've seen coal generators over the age of 40 years decline to have an average availability of 65 per cent, so only 65 per cent of their capacity available to market,\" she said.\n\nLabor's $1 billion to launch Australia solar panel production Photo shows Several rows of solar panels with a wind turbine in the background. One in three Australian households have solar panels, but only 1 per cent are made here. There are hopes a new federal government program will change that.\n\nWith coal-fired power stations set to close, renewable projects have been emerging to take their place, including plans for a solar panel manufacturing site at nearby Liddell Power Station.\n\nMeanwhile, AGL is also pushing forward with its Hunter Energy Hub, which includes solar and wind projects as well as battery storage.\n\nChris D'Hotman said he \"often considers\" if he will need to change careers by moving into the renewable industry.\n\n\"Renewables are expanding at such a rapid rate,\" he said.\n\n\"It's something that we in the coal-fired sector ought to know more about.\"",

        "text": "The Northern Territory corrections commissioner says lockdowns are occurring \"all of the time\" at every NT prison, as inmate numbers continue to soar.\n\nMore than 1 per cent of the Northern Territory's population is incarcerated, with Department of Corrections (DOC) figures showing 2,834 people were behind bars as of Thursday.\n\nHalf of the people in jail are on remand, with the total prison population rising by 600 since the Country Liberal Party (CLP) was elected last August.\n\nDue to the rising prisoner numbers and staff shortages, lockdowns have been frequently implemented by the DOC.\n\nMore than 1 per cent of the NT's population is in prison. (Supplied)\n\nResponding to a question at budget estimates in NT parliament on Thursday, Corrections Commissioner Matthew Varley said he could not provide a specific figure on the number of lockdowns at adult prisons since September.\n\nInstead, he said there were \"lockdowns across all of the facilities all of the time\".\n\n\"[The number of lockdowns has] been substantial in the last number of months because of the rate of prisoner growth and the stretch that we have experienced,\" Commissioner Varley said.\n\n\" I would expect there would be some version of lockdown in most facilities most days. \"\n\n$460k repair works at Alice Springs jail Photo shows A tall fence with razor wire attached at the bottom and top. Blue sky and some jail buildings in the background. Overcrowding in the Alice Springs jail has contributed to a $460,000 repair bill at the facility.\n\nCommissioner Varley said it was difficult for the DOC to provide specific lockdown data, because they occurred \"in a range of scenarios\".\n\n\"From a cell or block or wing being locked down, to entire facilities,\" he said.\n\n\"It is relatively rare for a lockdown of an entire facility to occur because of the nature of staff shortages.\n\n\"What is more likely to occur is that the entire facility is locked down for short periods of time, depending on operational events.\n\n\"But [it is] more likely that various parts of the prison, various wings and cells are locked down \u2026 what we call rolling unlocks, which are staged locks and unlocks throughout the day.\"\n\nDuring the budget estimates session, the DOC did provide data on lockdowns in youth detention facilities.\n\nActing Deputy Commissioner Sasha Dennis said there were 25 \"rotational lockdowns\" between July 2024 and the end of March this year.\n\n\"They are due to operational requirements, such as low staffing or high levels of escorts, including court, medical, and leave of absences \u2014 requiring transport of young people outside of the facility,\" she said.\n\nThere were 55 youths in detention on Thursday, according to the DOC.\n\nPrisoners continue to be held in watch houses\n\nThe territory's three adult jails and two work camps cannot accommodate the entire prison population.\n\nPrisoners who cannot fit into those facilities are being held in police watch houses, where DOC staff have not been present since March.\n\nDuring budget estimates, Corrections Minister Gerard Maley said there were 70 prisoners in police watch houses as of Thursday.\n\nOf the 70 prisoners, 51 were being held at Palmerston watch house, 10 at Katherine watch house and nine at the watch house in Alice Springs.\n\nGerard Maley says there were 70 prisoners in police watch houses as of Thursday. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)\n\nMr Maley said 20 prisoners at the Palmerston watch house had been held there for more than a week, with one prisoner's stint stretching to 14 days as of Thursday.\n\nWhile in a watch house, prisoners do not leave their cell and lights remain on 24 hours a day, Mr Maley confirmed.\n\nMore than $19 million spent on overtime\n\nIn February, the NT government passed legislation allowing it to hire private and interstate guards to work in the corrections system.\n\nThe government subsequently contracted private security firm G4S to manage prisoner transfers in Darwin, in a bid to boost the overall workforce and reduce overtime payments.\n\nDuring budget estimates, Commissioner Varley said the overtime bill \"for custodial operations\" between July 2024 and the end of March this year reached $19.23 million, for 266,000 extra hours worked.\n\n\"That's an average of 355 hours per prisoner,\" he said.\n\n\"By the time we get to June 30, we'll probably end up with an overtime bill similar to what we did last year.\"",

        "text": "Australians are being urged to shop local and lend a hand to support farmers hit hard this past year by severe drought and floods.\n\nMany have been left wondering how they can help farmers after seeing the devastating impact of drought in South Australia and Victoria and flooding in Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nShopping local is one way, but there are also opportunities for everyday Australians to roll up their sleeves to work on farms, or even offer farmers a holiday.\n\nAgricultural groups say farmers and regional communities feel direct benefits if shoppers buy local produce. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\nAustralian Made chief executive Ben Lazzaro said buying local generated direct income and jobs, particularly in regional areas.\n\n\"We should be looking for Aussie products and produce 365 days a year,\" Mr Lazzaro said.\n\n\" But when [producers] are doing it tough, it makes sense for us all to put a little bit more in our shopping baskets. \"\n\nRecent rain not enough\n\nWhile parts of SA and Victoria have recently received some rain, it is not enough to break the prolonged drought and farms could take years to recover.\n\nBuy Local Buy SA marketing manager Penny Reidy encouraged shoppers to buy SA-grown citrus, which had been impacted by an extraordinarily hot, dry summer.\n\nPenny Reidy and Citrus SA chair Mark Doecke launching a citrus campaign at the SA Produce Market. (Supplied: Penny Reidy)\n\nWhile fruit size was down, quality and yields were still high.\n\n\"If you're buying oranges in the height of summer, chances are they're probably coming from the US \u2026 but if you buy in-season then you know that it's grown here in South Australia,\" Ms Reidy said.\n\n\"If you buy from a local fruit and vegetable store, and buy in-season, then you're supporting the local economy through the whole supply chain as well.\"\n\nDairy, wine battling multiple challenges\n\nAlong with taking a hit from drought and floods, South Australian Dairyfarmers Association's Rob Brokenshire said the dairy industry was also competing with cheaper imports.\n\nThe dairy industry wants supermarkets to clearly label Australian-made products. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\n\"This is a time when we need to push back on imports and we need to become parochial as South Australian and Australian, and buying locally absolutely makes a difference,\" Mr Brokenshire said.\n\nThe Australian wine industry has been battling on many fronts \u2014 from drought to reduced consumer demand and low grape prices.\n\nPaxton Wines head winemaker Ashleigh Seymour said small and medium-sized producers were doing it especially tough.\n\n\"Next time you're in the bottle shop trying to choose some wine for dinner, or take to a friend's house, try and buy Australian \u2026 especially as we go through these tough times,\" she said.\n\nAshleigh Seymour says the wine industry is battling on many fronts. (Supplied: Ben Kelly)\n\n\"Whether it's grape or lamb or grain production, it's not just that specific industry that is affected.\n\n\" It's all the other businesses that are around that and support that farming community, and that stretches way further than you can really imagine. \"\n\nVolunteers also needed\n\nFor those with some spare time or money, there are also charities collecting donations and volunteers to help farmers directly.\n\nBlazeAid relaunched its Give a Farmer a Break program, which \"matchmakes\" farmers and volunteers with help such as fence building, livestock agistment, and holidays.\n\nBlazeAid volunteers replacing a damaged farm fence in south-west Queensland. (Supplied: BlazeAid)\n\nBlazeAid founder Kevin Butler said city dwellers were reaching out wanting to help.\n\n\"If they can help avoid just one suicide or marriage break-up, or depression coming back to farmers going through hell, I think it's worth it,\" Mr Butler said.\n\n\"The idea is [volunteers] can come to your farm, you teach them how to feed the sheep or the dogs, water the garden, or whatever, and give you a break. Or give you a chance to do something else. Or even go on a holiday.\"\n\nRegional charity Rural Aid provides services such as free mental health programs, counselling, and water tank and hay deliveries to farmers directly.\n\nChief executive John Warlters said it had experienced a huge increase in demand and relied on public generosity to keep up \u2014 either as a monetary donation or volunteering.\n\nFloods have damaged farming infrastructure. (ABC Southern Qld: Jon Daly)\n\n\"It's donations from mums and dads, community groups and sporting clubs, but it's also from businesses big and small,\" Mr Warlters said.\n\n\"The more the situation is shared with the broader public, and the more people understand how tough it is at the moment, they definitely want to be part of the solution.\"",

        "text": "\u201cTurn that f---ing phone off! You and your f---ing phone!\u201d Barbagallo shouted at customers, as they screamed and exited the venue. \u201cGet out of my f---ing restaurant!\u201d\n\nHe stands over the customer, admonishing him, before shouting profanities at the group, pulling their tablecloth, smashing the remaining plates and glasses.\n\nFootage obtained by this masthead shows one of the customers recording a video message to his partner complaining about the spice of the food before celebrated chef Pietro Barbagallo looms in the corner of the clip.\n\nThey ordered wine and starters, but when the prawn pasta arrived, it was simply too spicy and the waitress agreed to replace the dish. The nasty turn the night then took was caught on camera.\n\nIt was a bustling Thursday evening at the heritage-listed terrace, with almost every white-clothed table filled as the trio took their seats. They were excited to try the Carlton restaurant that had recently gone viral on social media.\n\nDimmed lights, soft music and the smell of fresh sugo greeted the friends as they entered popular Italian eatery Kaprica for dinner.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nShe described two incidents as particularly memorable. She alleges Barbagallo once threw a pizza shovel at her head, then on a separate occasion exposed his genitals to her at his house after offering her cocaine and champagne.\n\n\u201cIt was relentless,\u201d she said. \u201cHe smashed plates on peoples\u2019 tables. He would shout all the time, throw things, smash glasses and plates.\u201d\n\nCarly Lauder worked for the celebrated chef in the early 2000s at his former restaurant, I Carusi in Brunswick. Having built a career in hospitality \u2013 where she still works today \u2013 Lauder said Barbagallo was by far the worst person she has ever worked for.\n\nCarly Lauder says Barbagallo exposed his genitals to her and threw a pizza shovel at her. Credit: Simon Schluter\n\nBarbagallo did not respond to repeated requests for comment or to a detailed list of emailed questions. When this masthead approached him at his restaurant this week again asking him to respond to the allegations, particularly of indecent exposure, he said, \u201cno, no, no\u201d before closing and locking the door.\n\nBarbagallo, who was credited by The Age in 2005 with kick-starting Melbourne\u2019s \u201cpizza revolution\u201d, also stands accused of indecent exposure, inappropriate sexual comments towards staff and financial mismanagement across his venues.\n\nInterviews with 19 current and former employees at Barbagallo\u2019s restaurants suggest this incident was not isolated, with allegations of aggressive outbursts stretching back decades. The claims come as the wider industry is struggling to overcome a historic work-hard-play-hard culture that critics say enabled poor conduct by those in positions of power.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him throw cutlery when he\u2019s mad, throw plates and smash them against the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary and dehumanising.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, several waitstaff have resigned from Kaprica citing Barbagallo\u2019s aggressive behaviour, including Petrea James, who said his outbursts were frequent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing this the whole time, and he\u2019s still being held up on a pedestal,\u201d she said.\n\nLauder decided to tell her story after The Age\u2019s Good Food published a positive review of Kaprica last month .\n\nThis account was corroborated through interviews with three people Lauder told at the time.\n\n\u201cHe disappeared then returned shaking his dick in everyone\u2019s face,\u201d Lauder said. \u201cThat was the only time he took his clothes off, but he made lewd disgusting sexual gestures towards all of us all the time. It was way before #MeToo. None of us ever thought to push back.\u201d\n\nOne customer was later filming a video message to send to his partner about his \u201cburnt lips\u201d, when Barbagallo confronted the table.\n\nKaprica in Carlton has seen a wave of new bookings after a viral TikTok campaign. Credit: Photograph by Chris Hopkins\n\n\u201cAll the pasta was running down the wall,\u201d said one witness.\n\nWhen the waitress returned to the kitchen to deliver the news, Barbagallo became enraged. He accused the customers of having eaten some of the pasta and smashed the ceramic plate against a kitchen wall.\n\nOne of the affected customers said the intensity of the chilli on the pasta made it \u201cinedible\u201d and that the waitress agreed to replace the dish as the complaint was not new \u2013 customers had complained about the spice before.\n\nThis masthead interviewed five eyewitnesses to Barbagallo\u2019s plate-smashing incident in April. They said he had appeared under a \u201ccloud\u201d throughout his shift.\n\nShe said his aggression quickly crossed a line, describing regular \u201coutbursts\u201d where he was \u201cshaking, pacing, throwing his arms around\u201d as he allegedly berated staff.\n\nWhile the incident came as a shock to customers, staff were not surprised. James joined Kaprica in mid-2024 and says she was warned Barbagallo had a \u201ctemper\u201d. She had worked with unpredictable bosses before in hospitality, and needed the money, so took the job.\n\n\u201cThe workers told us it was definitely not the customers\u2019 fault,\u201d one witness told this masthead. \u201cI was like, surely it wasn\u2019t the owner. The place is so well-known. We were like, \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom outside the restaurant, two witnesses saw a chair fly out the front door towards the customer. Two waitresses were seen exiting the venue, one in tears.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly awkward,\u201d one witness said. \u201cThe music was playing but everyone was shocked and disturbed.\u201d\n\nHis \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d was heard from the street. One witness thought \u201ca homeless person was in there attacking someone\u201d. Inside, the usually bustling restaurant fell silent.\n\n\u201cHe would say things like \u2018you\u2019re all f---ing idiots and I\u2019m the biggest idiot for hiring you all\u2019. Your blood would run cold,\u201d she said.\n\nAccounts of Barbagallo\u2019s volatile behaviour were supported by almost all staff interviewed by this masthead, who separately claimed he would have \u201cmelt-downs\u201d, \u201cscreaming matches\u201d and \u201cexplosions\u201d of anger.\n\nA dozen women who worked in various roles around Barbagallo backed these claims but declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.\n\nOne woman alleged he threw plates or \u201cpans of hot food\u201d every couple of weeks.\n\nAnother woman said she \u201cliterally had a plate thrown at me\u201d by Barbagallo.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some severe personality issues there,\u201d the woman said. \u201cHe\u2019s totally unhinged, totally.\u201d\n\nA third woman described an incident where Barbagallo allegedly held a plate above a customer\u2019s head and screamed: \u201cI\u2019m going to smash your head in if you don\u2019t f---ing leave my restaurant\u201d after the customer complained about slow service. \u201cAnd then he kind of switched back, was like, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother employee described feeling \u201cfrozen\u201d by his aggression. The staff taught each other to \u201cjust nod and look down\u201d until he stopped yelling, in episodes that appeared \u201cmanic\u201d and like he was \u201cstuck in a loop\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you apologise or even God forbid try to explain the mistake, he just gets angrier and angrier and angrier and angrier and reiterates the same point over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nJames said the outbursts made her feel anxious, as Barbagallo switched between abusive and friendly. \u201cI got the shakes,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, you get goosebumps. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nWhen James quit earlier this year, she sent a text message to Barbagallo, citing his \u201cserious aggression and conflict\u201d.\n\n\u201cI find the way you speak to your staff extremely inappropriate,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBarbagallo responded: \u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\nAnother staff member, who did not want to be named, sent a similar resignation text message this year, calling out Barbagallo\u2019s \u201cunacceptable behaviour\u201d and prior \u201coutbursts\u201d.\n\nHe responded: \u201cSorry you feel that way\u201d.\n\nComplaints about Barbagallo\u2019s aggressive behaviour date back to the early 2000s. Credit: Marina Oliphant\n\nFourteen former staff members alleged varying levels of sexually inappropriate behaviour from Barbagallo, ranging from comments about their appearances and over-sharing about his own sexual experiences.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Lauder alleged Barbagallo \u201calways spoke about sex\u201d, had sexual relationships with his employees, and openly talked about plans to hire attractive young women.\n\nOne former staff member, who quit last month after she was reduced to tears by Barbagallo multiple times, was critical of this language.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of sickening to me, even still, just because of how sexualised I know all the service staff are in the way that is almost like an active decision when they\u2019re hired.\u201d\n\nThe employee said Barbagallo would \u201clook you up and down\u201d before hiring staff and often turned away men with experienced resumes.\n\nJames supported this position, saying Barbagallo often hired women in their early 20s who worked part-time while studying nearby at Melbourne University.\n\nShe said Barbagallo routinely commented on the appearance of customers and waitstaff, including herself when she dyed her hair a darker red colour.\n\n\u201cHe told me I looked goth, really good. He wouldn\u2019t stop commenting on it. It was just classic creepy boss vibes,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cThen he would always point out other people who dressed goth to me, and then tell me he wanted to do bad things to them. That he knew he shouldn\u2019t like them but he does and that just makes it all the more enticing.\u201d\n\nAnother former waitress alleged Barbagallo also made sexualised comments to her, including telling her she could work fewer shifts because \u201cessentially men would pay for my company \u2026 And I could sell my body\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising at the time but not infrequent,\u201d she said.\n\nThe same woman recalled him saying \u201cshe\u2019s so hot I would f--- her\u201d about a customer, and sharing stories about his sexual experiences and drug-taking.\n\n\u201cIt became common knowledge to know his ex-lovers\u2019 full names because he would talk about it,\u201d she said.\n\nBarbagallo in 2004 at his first Melbourne restaurant, I Carusi. Credit: John Woudstra\n\nThree employees who worked with Barbagallo at I Carusi in the early 2000s said Barbagallo had sexual relationships with much younger staff.\n\n\u201cI remember at the time being like why the f--- are her parents not stepping in here?\u201d one former employee said, noting the staff, though younger, were still consenting adults.\n\n\u201cHe was so inappropriate with all the young staff, myself included. He\u2019d touch your back when you walked past him. He was so creepy. It was such a gnarly vibe.\u201d\n\nBarbagallo came onto Melbourne\u2019s culinary scene in 1998, opening a no-frills pizza restaurant in Brunswick East, I Carusi.\n\nHe expanded over the years to open venues in St Kilda and Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where complaints of aggressive and inappropriate behaviour continued to mount.\n\nBarbagallo was declared bankrupt in 2011, according to corporate documents, and shut his Lonsdale Street restaurant and ended his involvement with all I Carusi restaurants.\n\nPublic bankruptcy documents obtained by this masthead that were signed in June 2011 show Barbagallo had $500 to his name and debts of $1,223,631, including $267,000 to Carusi and $40,000 to Mercedes-Benz Finance.\n\nWhen he opened Kaprica in Carlton soon after, Barbagallo reportedly \u201cslaved away solo in the kitchen\u201d for the first six months \u201calmost like he was doing penance\u201d.\n\nBut staff claim there was a haphazard approach to managing the restaurant\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cThe entire business was in cash,\u201d said one person who worked as Barbagallo\u2019s informal assistant in 2015. \u201cSo we were paid in cash, payments from customers were in cash. I would drive my bike to deposit like $15,000 worth of cash and he would pay his rent and children\u2019s lessons out of that money.\u201d\n\nKaprica has long been popular with locals, and moved to a two-storey venue on Grattan Street as demand expanded over the years. However, bookings from new customers have rocketed in the past 18 months after Kaprica engaged marketing firm Einwick and social media producer Hano Lokman to advertise the venue.\n\nLokman\u2019s videos used off-beat scripts and dim lighting to create short fictional narratives to promote the restaurant, clocking up hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok. He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMultiple current and former staff said the social media craze strained the business as Barbagallo would over-book, causing long waits for tables or service.\n\n\u201cWhen it started getting busy, it [aggression] was more frequent because he literally couldn\u2019t manage the restaurant and manage himself,\u201d alleged one former employee.\n\nWhile Kaprica paid an hourly rate higher than average, more than a dozen employees said Barbagallo does not provide payslips and transfers wages directly to bank accounts using calculations from paper time sheets.\n\nTwo employees became worried about Barbagallo\u2019s failure to pay superannuation and tax on their wages last year, and were given access to his books for a day in an attempt to solve their issues.\n\n\u201cIt was sheets of random bits of paper strewn around the place, and there were things like where there would be a month missing from this person\u2019s pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it took months for it to go to the accountant and be in the accounts. It was just an incredible level of procrastination.\u201d\n\nScreenshots from a WhatsApp group of Kaprica staff show conversations about payment irregularities were common.\n\n\u201cSorry to keep asking but does anyone have news on tax?\u201d one employee wrote last September.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d another responded. \u201cLast I heard he messaged his accountant and he never got a response \u2026 Not really a good enough reason, it\u2019s his responsibility.\u201d\n\nText messages show another employee was sacked this month after they told Barbagallo they were underpaid for public holiday shifts and pushed for their full entitlements.\n\n\u201cYep there is a mistake on my behalf which I\u2019ll fix tonight,\u201d Barbagallo responded. \u201cAlso you should learn some manners. And finally I think it best you found employment elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe employee responded: \u201cManners?? Why am I being fired?\u201d\n\nIt took weeks of messages for Barbagallo to pay the employee, who followed up multiple times.\n\nAnother former employee said she saw text messages on the restaurant phone from a former staff member begging for superannuation payments months after they had left.\n\n\u201cWe would get text after text from this employee who was like, \u2018Come on Pietro \u2026 It\u2019s been six months. How are you still not replying to me? Please.\u2019 He was ignoring her.\u201d\n\nLauder said these were longstanding practices and behaviours that Barbagallo needed to be held accountable for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 31 years. I\u2019ve worked as a chef, front-of-house, late-night cocktail bars.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is ever any reason for anyone to lose their shit, shout at people, throw things. Nothing is ever that stressful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dinner. He\u2019s not saving lives. If you can\u2019t handle it, you\u2019re in the wrong job.\u201d",

        "text": "Loading Associate professor in clinical psychology at The University of Melbourne, Isabel Krug, whose research focuses on eating disorders, says while anyone in any sport can develop an eating disorder, certain \u201caesthetic-based\u201d sports like figure skating and gymnastics, which privilege thinness, pose a greater risk factor for athletes. \u201cThese can reinforce disordered eating behaviours, especially, restricting food and orthorexic tendencies [obsession with healthy food], and body dissatisfaction.\u201d The environment of high-performance sports \u2013 in which athletes\u2019 bodies are their tools \u2013 can also contribute. \u201cThe way we measure athletes\u2019 bodies, the way we talk about their bodies, the language we use, are all really important factors,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cSport can add fuel to the fire.\u201d Still, Jeacocke says work is being done to better understand the complex relationship between high-performance sport and eating disorders. In 2020, the AIS and National Eating Disorders Collaboration published a statement on the topic, outlining guidelines for athletes, coaches, support staff, clinicians and sporting organisations. Jeacocke, who co-authored the statement, says preventing and identifying eating disorders in athletes requires a multipronged approach. \u201cIt\u2019s taking a really holistic view of athletes, looking at their mental and physical health. So, how do we optimise health and well-being to maximise performance?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to win gold medals, we want to break world records, yes, but how we do that is super important,\u201d she says. Three athletes \u2013 current and former \u2013 share their thoughts on why elite sport can be such a breeding ground for disordered eating, and what finally set them on the path to recovery. \u2018I just needed someone to sit and listen\u2019 Gorry with daughter Harper. She says pregnancy and motherhood played a role in overcoming her eating disorder. Credit: FIFA via Getty Images While football is not a weight-based sport, Gorry says the culture of regular weigh-ins, body fat checks and density scans contributed to a creeping obsession over food and the way she looked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much pressure every day to perform, to be a certain body shape and to be at our peak,\u201d she says. Gorry, who became a Butterfly Foundation ambassador in 2024, would like to see less focus on weight and a more nuanced understanding of women\u2019s health. \u201cAs footballers, it doesn\u2019t make sense to be weighing in. Everyone\u2019s going to weigh differently, being female athletes, you could put on 3 kilograms while you\u2019ve got your period, and we don\u2019t talk about the reasons why,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a number at the end of the day, it should be how you feel in your body and how you\u2019re performing.\u201d So, what was the turning point that set her on the path to recovery?\n\nAlongside clinical treatment and pregnancy, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her body, support from teammates helped. \u201cA big part of it was actually my roommate in the Matildas at the time, Michelle [Heyman]. She noticed and asked, \u2018I can see that you\u2019re struggling. Are you okay? I\u2019m here for you\u2019.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed. I didn\u2019t need someone to try and help me. I just needed someone to sit there and listen and point me in the right direction without pushing me.\u201d Now a mother to Harper and Koby, she says her experience with an eating disorder has shaped how she parents, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation Clara [Markstedt, Gorry\u2019s wife] and I both have all the time around food, or even when Harper\u2019s looking at herself in the mirror, just making sure we\u2019re validating her in the right way.\u201d\n\n\u2018My self-worth was attached to football\u2019 In 2010, Brock McLean, now 39, had just moved from Melbourne Football Club to Carlton. Having recently suffered injuries, he had lost speed on the field. His coaches recommended he lose weight. \u201cAgainst the advice of nutritionists and doctors, I agreed to do it because I was so desperate to get back to playing footy. My mental health issues at the time was that my self-worth was attached to football,\u201d he says. Former AFL footballer Brock McLean. Credit: Lus Enrique Ascui \u201cI was at the very apex of professional football. You couldn\u2019t go any higher than that. So I developed a really unhealthy way of viewing myself.\u201d\n\nMcLean embarked on a restrictive meal plan. He would suppress cravings for certain foods for weeks on end before giving in and bingeing, then overtraining and eventually using laxatives. Loading These behaviours dovetailed with anxiety, depression and addiction, and he developed bulimia nervosa. Young men and boys are often underrepresented in conversations about body image and eating disorders, despite the fact around one-third of those who suffer from an eating disorder are male. McLean says the stigma around eating disorders and mental illness in men\u2019s sport meant he was afraid to seek help.\n\n\u201cI was really uncomfortable opening up to people. I just couldn\u2019t do it because I felt like it was emasculating, particularly for an eating disorder.\u201d After retiring in 2014 and moving into the corporate world, the self-worth he had derived from football transferred to climbing the corporate ladder. But through seeing a psychologist, the tide has slowly started to turn. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you look like, what your job title is, how much money you make. You\u2019re a good person, you treat people well, you\u2019re a great dad and husband,\u201d he says. \u2018I only can imagine what I could have achieved\u2019\n\nDr Jennifer Hamer was diagnosed with anorexia at age 12. A promising endurance runner in her home country of England who represented Great Britain at the European Championships, her eating disordered progressed with her sporting career. \u201cI was always carrying my eating disorder with me, which I believe held me back a lot,\u201d she says, explaining she was frequently getting injured and spending time at the physio in rehab. Dr Jennifer Hamer, a former endurance runner, now works with athletes to prevent eating disorders. Credit: Steven Siewert \u201cMy pure love for the sport became really, really scarred by the fact that it was now being controlled by an eating disorder.\u201d While Hamer says it\u2019s difficult to say whether she would have developed an eating disorder had she not been involved in sports, she feels her coaches were ill-equipped to support her and her family.\n\nLoading \u201cThere\u2019s a point in your eating disorder in the early stages where it doesn\u2019t affect you negatively \u2026 I was winning races, so they were like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s winning. But let\u2019s keep pushing her harder.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t going to say anything because I was loving it because I was abiding by the eating disorder rules, and I was getting away with all the things that I wanted to do.\u201d At 22, Hamer\u2019s eating disorder meant she was so weak she could no longer run, and she was admitted to an inpatient clinic. There, she was given a career-ending diagnosis: she had osteoporosis from years of disordered eating. But for Hamer, now 33, it\u2019s only in the past four to five years she\u2019s really entered a space of recovery. She\u2019s also discovered a love for ocean swimming which allows her to indulge her love for endurance sports.",

The Australia-South Africa Test match has been played by 22 cricketers re-acquainting themselves with red balls and the concept of a game going for five days.\n\nIt\u2019s not their fault that they\u2019re not ready: a lack of readiness has been built into its design, as if the powers of international cricket want to look like they\u2019re saving the Test format while doing everything they can to undermine it. Imagine if a football World Cup final were played as a one-off, out-of-season friendly for the benefit of Jeff Bezos. Not even FIFA could screw up that badly.\n\nNone of South Africa\u2019s players had taken part in a first-class game of cricket in the past five months. One, Lungi Ngidi, last bowled a red ball in a match in August 2024. (He looked a tad rusty.) Three of the Australians had played some county cricket in England last month, but for the rest, their last first-class cricket was three to six months ago.\n\nRusty? Just a bit. Australian viewers might be a bit rusty too. Those who wanted to watch the game had to pinch their noses, hold their breath and submerge themselves in the swamp that is Amazon. For the Test match not to be protected by anti-siphoning laws gives a pretty good idea of how Australian regulatory and broadcasting interests rate it.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In its past 31 games since the 2023 VFL grand final, Werribee have had seven players drafted to the AFL. It\u2019s a staggering strike rate, born of the most basic principles. \u201cThis is like a country local footy club that plays at a higher level,\u201d says coach Jimmy Allan, who hails from down the road at Lara and played for Werribee in the early 2000s before a storied SANFL career. His assistant Kyle Hartigan hits another note. \u201cWe\u2019re a community club \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have this without them,\u201d he says, crediting not just the people of Werribee but sprawling Wyndham City, the fastest-growing municipality in Australia. Werribee CEO Mark Penaluna with senior players (L-R) Jesse Clark, Renee Tierney, Maddie Di Cosmo and Dom Brew. Credit: Paul Jeffers Michael Barlow, poster boy for late-bloomers who was drafted to Fremantle from Werribee in 2010, needs no prompting to join the chorus. \u201cThe Werribee Football Club has been the most important organisation in my life.\u201d If community, connection and care underpin Werribee, the product of the 1965 amalgamation of four local clubs also boasts an asset almost as constant as the ancient river red gums that flank its Chirnside Park home. Mark Penaluna, in his 22nd year as CEO, is the heartbeat of the club. \u201cAnyone who has been associated with local footy, we\u2019re just an extension of that, we\u2019re just talking bigger numbers,\u201d Penaluna says. To be a community club, he reckons, means leaving your ego at the door. \u201cWe understand we\u2019re not just here to win a game of footy, this is something people look forward to each week \u2013 training, games, sharing the wins and losses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery footballer starts at a local club, where much is done by few. When they arrive at Werribee, it\u2019s made clear that everyone \u2013 from the office to maintenance to the property steward \u2013 makes up the club. \u201cIf you see a broom and the floor\u2019s dirty, the expectation is you pick the broom up, give it a sweep, and make it clean for the next person.\u201d Many people whose lives are enriched here never lace a football boot. Wyndham Community Education runs eight English classes each week, making the club an early connection point for new arrivals to the area. On Sundays, Anglican followers of Sojourners Church gather for services held by pastor Andrew Seedhom, who is also club chaplain. Loading On game days, Penaluna spends half an hour on the gate before Seedhom relieves him, greeting players\u2019 families and Werribee\u2019s fans. Everyone is included in successes little and large, from office staff to sponsors to the volunteers who keep the wheels of community clubs turning. For Penaluna, football and its importance to community are ingrained. His father captain-coached Port Melbourne Colts. As a five-year-old, he had two game-day jobs: listen to the opposition coach\u2019s address and report back; and in quarters played with no added time, stand behind the goals and get the ball back to the umpires ASAP if the Colts were trailing. \u201cAnd if we were in front, kick the hell out of it the other way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe ran the Western Region league for five years before arriving at Werribee in 2003. His first game-day task was helping volunteers George and Jimmy drag the barbecue out of the showers under the old grandstand, so the umpires could get changed. There was no canteen; the barbie was a major source of income. \u201cWe had one desktop computer, and if it rained we had to put bubble wrap over it because there was a hole in the roof and possums living up there.\u201d CEO Mark Penaluna and community development manager Majok Ngong at Chirnside Park. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui His staff consisted of one part-time venue manager. The club\u2019s 2025 season guide lists Penaluna as one of 28 employees. More people work in community roles than once worked for the entire club. Welfare manager Damien Frankling has been around since 2008, chaplain Seedhom for the past four years. \u201cHaving those constants helps enormously, honest conversations and all that stuff,\u201d Penaluna says. Facilities help. In 2008, the club went to council with a proposed upgrade that had cost close to $12 million upon completion a decade later. Income is drawn from Wyndham entertainment venues, with $300,000 put back into the community annually, including sponsoring every football club in the municipality. \u201cWe agreed with council that we\u2019ll continue to provide these programs and extend them, and make sure we only charge community organisation rates not commercial,\u201d Penaluna says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWerribee has been a \u201cstandalone\u201d VFL club since 2018, after affiliations with Western Bulldogs and North Melbourne. The latter endures through the North Melbourne Werribee Kangaroos in the VFLW and \u201cThe Huddle\u201d, which has delivered programs to more than 50,000 young people since 2016 to strengthen education and employment outcomes. The club hosts English language classes for new migrants. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui For Barlow, who coached the Bees to runners-up in 2023 before Allan brought home the club\u2019s second premiership last year, being standalone is crucial to success. In training together throughout summer, bonds and trust are built and players improve by challenging each other. Playing every home game at a different venue \u2013 from Wangaratta to Torquay \u2013 during the 2017 renovations fostered an \u201canyone, anywhere, anytime\u201d zeal. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t standalone, some of the guys I played with just wouldn\u2019t play,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cThey\u2019d go and try and find connection and community and togetherness at a local club.\u201d He regards Shaun Mannagh, drafted by Geelong in 2023 aged 25, as \u201cthe most club-oriented person I\u2019ve met in football\u201d. Loading With VFL rivals Williamstown and Port Melbourne to the east and Geelong to the west, Werribee must be creative in their recruiting. There are enough Geelong-based players to warrant a van (they spin a key to see who drives), while leagues to the north like Ballarat, Ovens and Murray and Goulburn Valley produce players who fuel the country vibe. Allan chuckles at the notion that developing footballers so well surely equates to a queue of Werribee wannabes stretching along Watton St. Even in a competitive market, he doesn\u2019t use recent draft success as a carrot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would never say, \u2018Come here and we\u2019ll get you drafted.\u2019 If a club thinks they need them on their list they\u2019ll find a way. Our job is to help them be the best player and best person they can be. I know it\u2019s a cliche, but we\u2019re genuinely invested in doing that. \u201cWith the five who\u2019ve gone [to AFL clubs] in my time here, not once did they ask, \u2018What do I need to do to get drafted?\u2019 Their questions were around, \u2018What can I do to help our team be the best we can be?\u2019 It\u2019s about playing your role and doing it better than anybody else. That\u2019s why these guys are getting a chance.\u201d Zac Banch, picked up by North in the mid-season draft. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Smiling again, Allan adds, \u201cWe\u2019re big on cliches.\u201d Hartigan\u2019s story offers a compelling blueprint. Overlooked as an 18-year-old after trying to be something he wasn\u2019t, he spent three years at Werribee \u201cand just went back to what I was good at, which was nullifying opponents\u201d. Eventually, Adelaide identified a need in defence, \u201cand I was in the right place, right time, playing my role\u201d. He played 135 games for the Crows and Hawthorn. The cliche won out.

Jennifer Soo Previous Slide Next Slide We don\u2019t celebrate the works burger enough. Beetroot-stained roll. Pre-sliced \u201ctasty\u201d cheese. Shredded iceberg. Pineapple. Egg. Your choice of sauce. Although there\u2019s no clear consensus as to how or why the burger came about (although a surplus of tinned goods created by the opening of Edgell and Golden Circle canneries in the 1940s might have had something to do with it), its unknown creator is up there with Peter Russell-Clarke and Grandma Poss in terms of their influence on everyday Australian food. I\u2019m quite serious about this \u2013 the \u201cAussie\u201d burger is one of the few culinary creations we can claim as legitimately unique. Try finding beetroot, pineapple and barbecue sauce between bread on any other continent. I bring all this up because I may have found the best works burger in Australia. Wingello\u2019s $18 burger with the lot. Jennifer Soo I say \u201cmay\u201d because it\u2019s an impossible claim to confirm without visiting every fish and chip shop. Who knows what takeaway lurks near Beechworth or Kalgoorlie or the industrial sheds of Croydon Park? (I\u2019m also conscious of Paul\u2019s Famous Hamburgers and its faithful in Sylvania.) But gee, Wingello Village Store and Post Office knows its way around a spatula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to David Bruggeman, who runs the one-stop Southern Highlands shop with his family, the general store\u2019s dates back to 1865. Wingello is home to about 600 people, and Bruggeman and his wife Lana took over its only shop 16 years ago, extending the mail, newspaper and basic grocery services to include a cafe with \u201csimply good food\u201d. \u201cYou won\u2019t find avocado or Turkish bread or any of that stuff here,\u201d he tells me. Wingello Village Store and Post Office owner David Bruggeman. Jennifer Soo You will, however, find a formidable selection of milk bottles, caramel buds and chocolate freckles along the counter, and a menu heavy with truck-stop classics plus a whipped cream-topped sundae. If the indoor fire is going, marshmallow roasting is encouraged. I suspect the BLT is a paragon of the form, and the cinnamon toast is a super-duper breakfast, but the $18 works burger is the headline act. The soft, flat bun comes from Bryant\u2019s Bakery in Goulburn. Local butchers supply the beef and house-cured bacon. Lettuce, tomato and free-range eggs come from nearby farmers; the pineapple and beetroot comes from a can. Sauce is from a bottle, unless you ask for the house-made mayonnaise, but that\u2019s better saved for chips. Tomato sauce on an Aussie burger, forever and ever, amen. (The only good thing about ETA Original Barbecue is the bottle design. Yes, yes, I\u2019ll begin the process of revoking my citizenship now.) (From left) Martin, Zach, James, David and Peter Bruggeman. Jennifer Soo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, all this adds up to a tower of fresh flavour where each bite is underlined by a different ingredient. The bacon is generous. The onions, translucent but not browned. It may take a few bites until you hit pineapple. The 130-gram patty is lean on fat, which some burger purists will hate, but I don\u2019t mind finishing the thing and still feeling human. The perfect trinity of salty, sweet and lightly pickled. I brought a second burger back to Moss Vale for my partner, who was less keen to leave the throw-rug of our Airbnb for the half-hour trip to Wingello. By this time, all the components have had more time to mingle and develop in their white paper bag. Brilliant with half a glass of last night\u2019s gamay at 11:30am. A one-stop Southern Highlands shop. Jennifer Soo Thanks go to two-time Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championship finalist, and taco chef, Toby Wilson for alerting me to the burger three weeks ago. Wilson only discovered it after seeing an ad for the cafe before The Penguin Lessons at Bowral\u2019s Empire Cinema. (NB: The Bruggeman family has a YouTube channel where you can watch all their house-made cinema ads, dating back to 2020. It is absolutely worth your time.)

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It seems fitting that the opening number on OneFour\u2019s debut album, Look At Me Now, is titled Change. A pulsing track that sees the group reckoning with the past and thinking about the future: \u201cAnd now the question is: will you remain the same?\u201d raps Jerome \u2018J Emz\u2019 Misa over a heavy beat. \u201cOr are you willing to do whatever it takes to change?\u201d Change has been the one constant in OneFour\u2019s turbulent 10-year history as Australia\u2019s most prominent hip-hop outfit, a period defined by upheaval, controversy, prison time and hype \u2013 anything but stability. Since forming in 2014, the all-Pasifika rap crew from Mount Druitt in Western Sydney have experienced a decade of turbulence. Credit: Mridula Amin Formed in 2014, the all-Pasifika rap crew from Mount Druitt in Western Sydney was initially composed of five members \u2013 brothers Jerome and Pio \u2018YP\u2019 Misa, Salec \u2018Lekks\u2019 Su\u2019a, Dahcell \u2018Celly\u2019 Ramos, and Spencer \u2018Spenny\u2019 Magalogo. They quickly became the face of Australia\u2019s drill movement, a sub-genre of hip-hop that emerged from Chicago a decade ago. It is known for its faster, heavier sound and raw lyrics, often depicting gang culture. Adopting this style, OneFour infused it with a uniquely Western Sydney flavour, references to \u2018eshays\u2019 and \u2018lads\u2019 speaking to a subculture born from the very same streets they grew up in. It didn\u2019t take long for the group to tap into viral success, with songs like 2018\u2019s What You Know and 2019\u2019s Spot The Difference going platinum on the ARIA charts and racking up hundreds of millions of streams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the buzz grew, so too did the accolades. ARIA nominations followed, while hip-hop superstars, including Skepta, Dave, A$AP Ferg, and the Kid Laroi, voiced their support for OneFour\u2019s warts-and-all portrait of street life in Mount Druitt. \u201cMy district has too much drillers, like who wants it? Like who wants war with Sydney\u2019s realest?\u201d Spot The Difference, OneFour But their meteoric rise was halted in 2019 when Lekks, Celly and YP were jailed for a pub brawl. That same year, a national tour was cancelled after venues began pulling out, something OneFour attributed to pressure from the police and confirmation that the group was being monitored by two elite police units \u2013 Strike Force Raptor, created to hunt underground criminal networks, and Strike Force Imbara, which investigates gang feuds. In a widely circulated voice memo supplied to the ABC, Sergeant Nathan Trueman from the Raptor squad promised, \u201cI\u2019m going to use everything in my power to make your life miserable until you stop doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d The constant noise around OneFour only seemed to boost their infamy. Their shows continued to be cancelled while their streaming numbers skyrocketed (they have an impressive 2.4 million monthly listeners on Spotify). OneFour have regularly been targeted by police and prevented from performing. Credit: YouTube The release of a 2024 Netflix documentary, Against All Odds, broadened their reach yet reinforced the idea that the story of OneFour had become more important than the music they produced. \u201cExactly right,\u201d says J Emz. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we needed a change. We\u2019re about the music, and we want people to know that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sitting with J Emz, Celly and Spenny in a back room of Sony Music\u2019s headquarters in Sydney\u2019s CBD. There are bowls of lollies on the table and slabs of soft drinks, but no one eats or drinks anything. This is the new look OneFour after a lineup change.

Alongside him is Celly, who was recently released after serving five years of his 10-year sentence for the brawl. Next to me is Spenny, who is softly spoken and polite but visibly uncomfortable with being interviewed. I ask them about that first track, Change, and whether the lyrics were born out of a challenge they set themselves. \u201cFor sure, I don\u2019t think any of us can pretend we haven\u2019t made mistakes,\u201d says J Emz. \u201cBut we\u2019ve grown up a lot. So much has happened in our career to knock us off track \u2013 some of that is our fault, some of it isn\u2019t, but we\u2019ve gotten much better at holding each other accountable.\u201d What does that look like? \u201cThere have been some heated chats for sure,\u201d admits J Emz, while Celly and Spenny nod in agreement. \u201cSometimes I got to remind the boys what they\u2019re going back to if this doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRapping about Sydney gang subcultures, OneFour\u2019s focus on the grittiness of the streets \u2013 violence, drug-dealing and run-ins with the police \u2013 blurred the lines between their art and life. Credit: Michael Candrick No one knows that better than Celly, whose incarceration meant he missed much of the album\u2019s development. Instead, he worked on his lyrics in prison and recorded once he got out. \u201cThe journey for me was different [with this album] being in jail; you can either sit there and waste your days or try to use the time wisely, so I started writing a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cAll you have is time to think about what you\u2019ve done to end up there and what you\u2019ll do not to go back, so the minute I got out, I was straight into it.\u201d \u201cI dropped that ball, time out, they threw me inside, I\u2019m back on the bench.\u201d Celly on Look At Me Now\u2019s Family The result is Look At Me Now, a sprawling 15-track album on which the group collaborates with several high-profile UK drill rappers, including Nemzzz, Headie One, and Abra Cadabra. The record also sees OneFour collaborate for the second time with the Kid Laroi on Distant Strangers. Laroi and OneFour first crossed paths when they were both coming up and have remained close throughout Laroi\u2019s success, with OneFour the opening act on his most recent tour of Australia. \u201cI get inspired by Laroi every time, any opportunity we get to be around him is a learning for us,\u201d says Spenny. \u201cThis is a guy on top, and he\u2019s still the same kid we knew from back in the day.\u201d OneFour with a young The Kid Laroi (third from the right) in Redfern.

According to the group, NSW police continue to pressure venues by demanding extra user-pays-police (where officers are hired to police a private event paid for by the venue), leaving venues unwilling to host the band in their hometown.

However, the decision as to whether an event will proceed lies with the relevant venue.\u201d Loading J Emz admits that, for the first time, he\u2019d encourage NSW Police to listen to their music. \u201cThe message is: we\u2019re different now, we\u2019re good people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be defined by what I did,\u201d adds Celly. \u201cI served my time, suffered the consequences, and this is the next chapter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The declining rates of vaccination in Australia are \"very distressing\", according to one immunologist, as the federal government looks to tackle declining immunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler launched the national immunisation strategy on Thursday, which aims to increase vaccine uptake and foster community trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the kind of program that experts have told SBS News is vital in protecting vulnerable communities and children from diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Dwyer, an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the University of NSW, told SBS News there has been an erosion of trust in vaccines.\n\n\n\n\"Declining rates of vaccination, especially among children in Australia, are very distressing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you look at what's happening in the US, with the dismissal of top vaccine officials, it's a worry. Misinformation can be spreading not only there but here as well,\" Dwyer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced on Monday he is removing all 17 sitting members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee and replacing them with new members.\n\n\n\n\n\nDwyer said it's necessary for the Australian government to take a proactive approach to improve vaccination rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got to counter this misinformation, which is far outweighing the good information that's available through social media,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat are the current childhood vaccination rates?\n\nData from 2020 to 2024 shows a decline in the vaccination rate among children under the age of five, according to Australia's National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of children in Australia are vaccinated, but the government and experts say the goal is to reach 95 per cent coverage to ensure strong community protection.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, vaccination rates among children under the age of five have declined between 2020 and 2024. Source: SBS News In 2024, 91.6 per cent of one-year-olds were fully vaccinated, a drop from 94.8 per cent in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-year-olds were less likely to be fully vaccinated, with 89.4 per cent in 2024, a 2.7 per cent drop from 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy age five, 92.7 per cent of children were vaccinated in 2024, compared to 94.9 per cent in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFully vaccinated coverage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continued to decrease in 2024 at all three age milestones.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the largest drop was recorded at 24 months of age, with coverage declining by 4.5 per cent since 2020.\n\n\n\nVaccination coverage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continued to decline in 2024 across all three milestone ages \u2014 one, two and 5 years. Source: SBS News \"Australia has high vaccination rates when you look globally, but our rates have fallen alarmingly,\" Dwyer said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This requires a positive campaign that makes people feel comfortable and yes, makes them feel a little guilty if they haven't done the best by their child by vaccinating them.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's the government's plan?\n\nThe national immunisation strategy aims to increase vaccination uptake across Australia over the next five years by reducing vaccine hesitancy and improving access.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan outlines priority areas, including enhancing vaccine access in First Nations communities, strengthening the immunisation workforce, and building trust.\n\n\n\nThe government's national immunisation strategy aims to improve vaccination uptake across Australia over the next five years by reducing vaccine hesitancy and improving access. Source: SBS News It also lists priority groups with conditions that put them at a greater risk of contracting or experiencing severe outcomes from vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes the elderly, pregnant women and children.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Trauer, the head of epidemiological modelling at Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, told SBS News these communities, especially those who may not be eligible for certain vaccines, are the most vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some infectious diseases, you are really looking to rely on vaccination coverage to totally eliminate the disease or reduce its severity,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If your vaccination coverage falls below a certain level, you get outbreaks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For lots of infectious diseases, you get substantial immunity against infection through the vaccine, and you can totally control them and even reach elimination for many infectious diseases just by reaching high enough coverage,\" Trauer said.\n\n\n\nWhile 'herd immunity' cannot \"totally protect\" people from some viruses, such as COVID-19, he said others, like measles, can be \"eliminated\" from the population.\n\n\n\nWhat if your child has missed a vaccine?\n\nTrauer said each vaccine has specific guidelines for the optimal age at which it should be given to a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's essential to consult a specialist about your options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would absolutely recommend that anyone in that situation go and see somebody with expertise in that area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is often possible and advisable to get some sort of catch-up schedule, particularly for the most important infectious diseases.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Jafar Panahi is one of Iran's most acclaimed filmmakers, yet most of the films he has produced over his 30-year career are banned in his home country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has been accused of \"propaganda against the regime\" and imprisoned twice by Iranian authorities since 2010. But that hasn't stopped the 65-year-old director from making work; instead, he has taken his filmmaking underground.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis latest film, It Was Just an Accident, draws inspiration from his time in prison, particularly his experience of solitary confinement at Tehran's notorious Evin prison in 2010.\n\n\n\nJafar Panahi made an unexpected appearance at the opening night of the Sydney Film Festival. Source: Supplied / SFF/Tim Levy Speaking with SBS News ahead of the film's Australian premiere, Panahi recounts being locked in a cell barely big enough to lie down and forced to sit blindfolded for weeks on end.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis only contact during this time was with a faceless interrogator, whose identity remains a mystery to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I only talked when they took me to interrogation \u2026 I would have sat on a chair facing the wall, with my eyes closed, blindfolded, and behind me was the interrogator. He would talk or write something, and give it to me,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOnly then did my sense of hearing work. It means that all your senses will fade, and you just become curious to see who you are dealing with and [try to] understand their personality from their voice.\n\n\"At that time, I tried to keep all the details of this voice in mind \u2026 How much of that voice is with me now, I don't really know. Whether I would remember it if the same person came and spoke behind me, I don't really know,\" Panahi says.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Iranian director wins top prize at Cannes, urging 'unity' and 'freedom' SBS News 25/05/2025 08:27 Play\n\nPanahi's lingering curiosity about his interrogator and whether he would recognise him if they encountered each other again forms the basis for the film, although he stresses it\u2019s not autobiographical.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt tells the story of a group of former political prisoners in Iran who stumble across and subsequently kidnap a man they believe to be their former torturer while on a road trip. They then wrestle with the dilemma of what to do: show mercy or exact revenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of it was my experience, and the rest of it was the experience of other friends in prison \u2026 I definitely didn't have the experience those friends had in prison,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I came out [of prison], after a while, the things I had heard would come to my mind and they would live with me, and I realised that I had to express them somehow, and eventually, when they were outpoured, it became 'It Was Just an Accident'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This film starts with the voice at the beginning, and then it follows with those stories.\"\n\n\n\nFrom persecution to innovation\n\nPanahi first started exploring experiences of imprisonment under Iran's regime in 2000 with his film The Circle, which is a critical analysis of the treatment of women in Iran from the perspective of two prison escapees.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle did he know he would be arrested and sentenced to time in prison just ten years later during Iran's Green Movement protests.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe then-50-year-old had been working on a film set amid the protests, which rose in response to the 2009 presidential election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \u2014 a result many believed was rigged.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Iran's Panahi winner at Berlin film fest\n\nHundreds, including Panahi, were arrested, and several were killed during the movement. He was subsequently banned from filmmaking, giving interviews and travelling outside of Iran for 20 years and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanahi managed to remain free, and it was at that point that he took his filmmaking underground.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the coming decade, he would produce some of the most notable films of his career, including 2011's This is Not a Film, which he co-directed with Mojtaba Mirtahmasb and famously smuggled out of the country on a USB wedged into a cake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I was first given a 20-year ban from working, I was thinking about what I should do now,\" Panahi says.\n\n\n\nShould I say goodbye to the cinema? Should I be sidelined? Or should I look for a solution to how to work?\n\nRather than act as a deterrent, the ban propelled Panahi into a period of innovation. Along with This is Not a Film, he produced Closed Curtain in 2013 and Taxi in 2015, which round out a trilogy of films shot covertly while Panahi was under house arrest in northern Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Taxi, which won the Golden Bear \u2014 the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival \u2014 Panahi took his renegade cinema to the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film is shot entirely from the inside of a car, using a camera attached to the windshield, which mimics an \"anti-theft device\" typically placed on car dashboards. The actors each enter and exit the scenes as Panahi, who is driving, picks them up and drops them off.\n\n\n\nTaxi was filmed secretly in Tehran, with Jafar Panahi posing as a taxi driver and using a camera disguised as a security device. Credit: Supplied \"We slowly found a solution to come out of the house and film on the street ... I found a solution to go into a village and even to the border. I could even send my group across the border,\" Panahi says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We found ways to do all of this. Of course, it had its own difficulties.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJust over a decade after his filmmaking ban was first enforced, in July 2022, Panahi was arrested when he went to the prosecutor's office in support of his fellow filmmakers, Mohammad Rasoulof and Mostafa Aleahmad, who were being held in detention.\n\n\n\nPanahi would spend the next seven months in prison, listening to stories from inmates \u2014 stories that would lay the groundwork for It Was Just an Accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had a lot of time and every time I talked to one of these people. They wanted to talk all the time, and I was an attentive listener; I sat and listened to what they had to say,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanahi was released in February 2023, just days after he started a hunger strike in protest against the behaviour of the security and judicial apparatus in Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe quickly set about working on his next film.\n\n\n\nIn Iran, all films must first get a production permit before filming begins, and then a separate screening permit after the film is completed. The country's culture and Islamic guidance ministry is responsible for the permits. Credit: Supplied\n\n'Film is valuable work'\n\nAs with his other films over the last 15 years, Panahi shot and produced It Was Just an Accident without obtaining the usual permissions required by Iran's culture and Islamic guidance ministry, which strictly regulates film production in the country. It was filmed in secret, and the female actors didn't wear the country's compulsory hijab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In countries that have totalitarian governments, they try to create conditions in any way possible that they are not united with each other,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we live inside Iran, we can feel this very well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the challenges of making films and the constant threat of imprisonment, Panahi remains resolute in his commitment to the art form.\n\n\n\n\"I'm a filmmaker who is focused on social issues. I get inspiration from the society I live in and I create my own film,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"First, I have to accept that that film is a valuable work that I can put my signature on.\"\n\n\n\nI really hope my film gets shown in Iran and that Iranians get to see it. I've worked very hard for it.\n\nInternational acclaim\n\nIt Was Just an Accident made its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where it received the Palme d'Or, one of the most prestigious film awards, given to the director of the Best Feature Film of the Official Competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanahi travelled to France for the ceremony, marking his first trip outside of Iran in 14 years. The moment he was announced as the winner, he appeared emotional, smiled, and remained seated for a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on the moment, he says he was thinking about a phone call he had received from prison in Iran just a day earlier.\n\n\n\nAfter his mentor Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi is the second Iranian filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or award. Source: Getty / Stephane Cardinale / Corbis \"This friend who contacted me said that 'we had found a sense of hope inside the prison and that we wanted to do something here after you succeeded',\" Panahi says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was moved by the call and says he felt a responsibility to live up to their hopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was constantly feeling responsible. I was constantly feeling anxious. I don't know what the right word would be to describe it. I was starting to think that there was a heavy burden on my shoulders. I didn't sleep that night,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they announced it [the Palme d\u2019Or], I just breathed a sigh of relief \u2026 I didn't have the strength to get up from my chair at all.\"\n\n\n\nI said to myself, 'this burden has been lifted off my shoulders and I won't disappoint those friends again. Now, they will be happy in prison.'\n\nThe film will screen for the first time in Australia this weekend at the 72nd Sydney Film Festival, which is also screening a retrospective of his feature films titled Cinema in Rebellion.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanahi made a surprise guest appearance at the festival's opening gala, which was kept under wraps for his safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis trip to Australia is his second time leaving Iran since 2010.\n\n\n\nIranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident will be screened at the Sydney Film Festival.

This may be my weakness, that I can't adapt to another place,\" Panahi says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Knowing myself, on the very first day I arrived [in Cannes] \u2026 I announced that I would come back [to Iran] under any circumstances, and I did what I believed in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not a brave person at all. I just announced this because I'm not able to live outside of Iran. What danger could there be? Is it more dangerous than a woman going out in Iran without wearing a hijab?\"\n\n\n\nDespite the heartfelt support of the world cinema community, Panahi's Palme d'Or win was not welcomed by Iranian officials, who summoned France's charg\u00e9 d'affaires after the French foreign minister called the film \"a gesture of resistance\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also publicly condemned the French government, citing its \"misuse of its role as host of a film event to advance its political agenda against the Islamic Republic of Iran\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite the criticism and ongoing concerns for Panahi's safety, the filmmaker returned home after the Cannes Film Festival, where he was greeted by fans at the airport, clapping and chanting \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" \u2014 the rallying cry of the women's rights movement sparked after the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As soon as you feel that hope has been created \u2014 that moment of receiving an award and that phone call that was in prison \u2014 as soon as you see these in the people who have come to welcome you, you feel happy.\"\n\n\n\nYou feel that you have created a sense of hope, especially in young filmmakers, that their films will finally pay off.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Defence Minister Richard Marles is downplaying concerns over news the United States government has placed the AUKUS defence agreement under review, threatening Australia's access to nuclear-powered submarines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've known about the review for some time. We welcome it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's being interviewed here on Sky News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do have a sense of confidence about the way in which AUKUS is playing out under the Trump administration, and that we will meet the pathway that we have committed to and that we've committed to in a treaty between our three nations, but in the context of that I think it's totally understandable that an incoming government will want to undertake a review.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third party to the AUKUS is the United Kingdom - and they are also reviewing the $368 billion defence pact.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's the US review of this massive submarine deal that has caused alarm in some quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt falls against a backdrop of doubts about Donald Trump's stance.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"Will you be discussing AUKUS with the prime minister, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"AUKUS, the Australia-US defence alliance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat exchange took place in February, and although Mr Trump later clarified that he does know what AUKUS is, it left lingering questions about whether it's seen as a priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the US review is to assess whether the agreement aligns with the Trump administration's 'America first' agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has already invested $800 million dollars as a down payment to secure three Virginia class nuclear submarines from 2032.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US defence bureaucrat conducting the review, according to reporting from the Financial Times, is Elbridge Colby.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's expressed scepticism about AUKUS before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we can produce the attack submarines in sufficient number and sufficient speed, then great but if we can't that becomes a very difficult problem because we don't want our servicemen and women to be in a weaker position and more vulnerable. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US submarine building program is lagging years behind its production schedule, prompting concerns Australia's submarines could be delayed or simply not delivered at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking with Sky, Richard Marles concedes that, on this front, there is work to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a big challenge, in getting those sustainment and production rates up. We knew that when we signed, when we reached the optimal pathway agreement back in March of 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNews of the review comes as the Trump administration pressures Australia to hike defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP, with US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth highlighting what he called \"a real and potentially imminent\" threat from China.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pushed back against that pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ah, no, what we'll do is we'll determine our defence policy, and we've invested - just across the forwards - an additional ten billion dollars in defence. What we'll do is continue to provide for investing in our capability, but also investing in our relationships in the region.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia currently spends around 2 per cent of GDP on defence, with a goal to raise that to 2.3 per cent within ten years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has pushed for a higher target of 2.5 per cent within 5 years, and 3 per cent inside the next decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefence spokesperson Angus Taylor has sought to highlight this difference in light of today's news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to know to what extent was the review triggered by Labor's failure to fund defence in this country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has also been critical of Australia's decision to level sanctions this week against two far-right Israeli ministers for inciting violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's other AUKUS partner, the UK, applied the same sanctions, along with Canada, New Zealand, and the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the US, a close ally and arms supplier to Israel, says the sanctions undermine its efforts to advance a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Taylor also questioned whether the decision to sanction Israel was a factor behind the US review.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, others suggest the US review points to a need for Australia to conduct its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is literally a denial of reality in Canberra. I don't think we're going to get any submarines from the Americans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaking this morning to the ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother outspoken former PM, Paul Keating, says in a statement that this \"might be the moment Washington saves Australia from itself\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens have also been critical of the AUKUS agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's defence spokesperson, Senator David Shoebridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you wanted to be reckless with Australia's defence, you would continue down the AUKUS path. Yet that is exactly what Labor and the Coalition are proposing to do, without any review. Right now, we need an urgent parliamentary review into AUKUS, which can't just be populated by the noddies in Labor and the coalition, but which must have critics of AUKUS on that parliamentary review. The Australian public deserves at least that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Marles has dismissed calls to dump AUKUS or develop a Plan B, saying there can be no more alterations after years of indecisive policy on defence acquisition.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Jay Allan was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver a decade later, after recovering, he founded the Australian Skin Cancer Foundation, hoping to support patients who have similar experiences, and promote sun safety messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Often people don't think (you need to apply sunscreen), especially in winter. But in many parts of Australia, U-V levels are 3 or above, right through the winter months. So really important when you go outside and even you think, 'oh it's cloudy today', we definitely recommend that (you) look at the U-V rating on your phone and often as I mentioned, the levels are 3 and above each day, you should follow the five sun safe rules including applying sunscreens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has the highest melanoma rates in the world, and is the third most common cancer in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunscreen has been at the heart of sun safety messaging for decades - but a new report has raised concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report from consumer advocacy group CHOICE has found that only four out of the 20 popular sunscreen products in Australia they tested actually match the rating of Sun Protection Factor - or S-P-F - they claimed to have.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe testing DOESN'T mean the sunscreen products are NOT working, but they might just not be as effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut CHOICE's chief executive Ashley De Silva says the issue here is that some products aren't aligned with what they HAVE claimed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We picked a whole range of brands, many products I think people would be familiar with across the country, and one thing it stands out is that it's not aligned to the brand, so you saw brands like Cancer Council and Neutrogena, they were both one of the four sunscreen that worked, but both of them have products that didn't make their claims as well, so it's not necessarily brand related, it's very specific to the product, and in one instance we had a product that scored as low as four when it was advertised as 50+, it was so low we re-tested it in a separate lab with a different batch of that product, and it came back with a five.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, sunscreen products with an SPF of 30 are already effective to use, while those in the range of 30 to 59 provide HIGH protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TGA says that regardless their brands and SPF levels, sunscreens need to be re-applied frequently.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the CHOICE report, half of the 16 products still fall into the SPF range between 30 and 50.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix of them are between 20 and 30 - which could be less effective if you often go outdoors.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHOICE contacted the brands following their reports, and while all the brands say they stand by their products, Ashley De Silva says the T-G-A need to take action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The TGA needs to kind of look at the fact that this is so far apart and what we are asking them to do is at least for the compliance testing on the 16 products that we've tested that didn't meet their claims.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, the T-G-A has said they are investigating the findings from CHOICE, and will take regulatory action as required.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, experts and advocates say the sun safety message remains the same - and the importance of sunscreen is unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Allan again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know, if you're using sunscreen at the moment and it's working, you're not getting burnt, then continue to do that. But I guess we'll wait for the second round of the testing to be done, but we just stick to what the scientists and the research points to and that is that sunscreen, you know, can prevent skin cancers, including basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and in a particular deadly melanoma. So until researchers and you know, come out and say that sunscreen is no good for you, then we can run with that message, but we just got to stick to the science at the moment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor David Whiteman from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute says other approaches for sun safety are also important.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Professor says sunscreen should only be the last line of defence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We advise people to seek shade from the sun, to protect their skin using hats and sunscreens, and adopt protective clothing, but sunscreen is really the last line of defence for skin that is unprotected to other measures, so it should never be the first line of defence, it's always something we apply to skin that we can't protect in other ways.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTamara Dawson is the founder of the Melanoma and Skin Cancer Advocacy Network.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe suggests checking the ultraviolet radiation - or U-V - before people head outdoors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important for all Australians to really understand what the U-V index is where they live, and what the U-V levels are, so in Melbourne, we can be a bit more careful with out sun protection over winter, but certainly in Queensland and other parts of Australia, there's a real opportunity for all Australians what their U-V exposure is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the 1980s, Australia has adopted the famous \"Slip, Slop, Slap\" public health campaign for sun safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Whiteman says sun protection measures can have different impacts on people with different skin tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the growth of immigration in Australia, he says authorities therefore need to rethink its public messaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look it certainly introduces new communication challenges, because no longer there's one-size-fits-all strategy work, so we need to make sure people at higher risks maintain their very high level of sun protection, and maintain vigilant against excessive sun exposure. But equally, there are other people who are at much lower risks, in fact have a risk of Vitamin D deficiency, so we must ensure that those people get the right message about how to protect themselves against low Vitamin Ds.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTamara Dawson has stressed the importance of including sun protection into daily routines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we have really high and harsh U-V levels in Australia. In the middle of summer, our U-V index reach 12, 13, 14, and the maximum in the UK or Europe at the peak of their summer is about 6. So there's so much we could all kind of implement our daily routine that can protect us from some of these harsh UV levels. The experts often tell us that incidental exposure, it's walking to the shops or food pick up. So it's not just the day that we are sitting on the beach that we need to think about our U-V exposure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jay Allan, his experience of melanoma is never far from his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says sunscreen is at the heart of his sun safe routine.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Wilson, the visionary force behind The Beach Boys and architect of the California sound, has died at the age of 82.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor millions, his music defined summers, dreams, heartbreak and hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut behind those shimmering harmonies was a man who spent a lifetime balancing brilliance with pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Hawthorne, California, Mr Wilson grew up in a household filled with music, pressure, and abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith his brothers Carl and Dennis, cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine, he formed a band that would soundtrack a generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even in their earliest hits, about surfing, cars, and high school romance, there were hints of something deeper - yearning, fragility, a search for meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Willman is chief music critic at Variety magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Wilson was so much more than a pop hitmaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we think of the great California acts of all time, the great LA bands of all time, we think of just a handful, the Beach Boys, the Doors, the Birds, not very many others. And the Beach Boys arguably are at the top of that heap and representing a California dream that may have been a little bit of an illusion. I think the world grew up thinking that everyone in California surfed because of the Beach Boys.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Wilson's masterpiece, Pet Sounds, released in 1966, remains a towering achievement in modern music.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a record that inspired Sergeant Pepper, moved the Beatles' Paul McCartney to tears, and gave us one of the most tender love songs ever written.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Willman says Wilson's ability to marry the simple with the symphonic set him apart from everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think Brian was the most talented musician in pop music of the 20th century, if we had to pick one. I'm not sure there's even competition for that; as much as we all love The Beatles, people like that, just in terms of being innately gifted, not as a lyricist, certainly not as a raconteur, he was not a particularly verbal person even in his best periods, but the sophistication of that music.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Brian Wilson's genius didn\u2019t come without cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was tormented by mental illness, fuelled in part by an abusive father, drug addiction, and the unbearable pressure of perfection.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe spent years in seclusion before reuniting with his daughters Carnie and Wendy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe later found love with Melinda Ledbetter, and although she died in 2024, their union helped him find late-life joy, and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith characteristic humility, Wilson reflected on being called an icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It means that I'm... I don't know exactly what it means. Do you know what it means? It just means that I\u2019m an icon. An icon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInducting Wilson into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Paul McCartney said his music had the power to make him cry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thank you sir, for everything that you've done for me, for making me cry, for having that thing that you can do with your music, you just put those notes, those harmonies together, stick a couple of words over the top of it and you've got me any day, ladies and gentlemen, Brian Wilson.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the sunny rebellion of Fun, Fun, Fun to the existential ache of I Just Wasn\u2019t Made for These Times, Brian Wilson\u2019s music was a diary of innocence lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn one occasion he reflected on his relationship with his fellow Beach Boys and problems during the original recordings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know - it's such a rough kind of memory for me because I had a lot of difficulty with the boys and they didn't want to cooperate with me so we just...we shelved 'Smile' in other words and I guess they probably said 'Oh that's good, I'm glad you shelved it.' I'm sure they were happy about that but you know. Sorry folks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his final years, Brian Wilson struggled with dementia and after his wife's death, his family placed him under conservatorship.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet, his music - still playing from radios and turntables and headphones around the world - remains ageless.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariety magazine's Chris Willman sums up his legacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean, a year or two ago they put out a Dolby Atmos version of the \u2018Pet Sounds\u2019 album, which is widely considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and it's really like listening to this incredible symphony when you're able to hear all those different parts. It just bowls you over. On top of just having very simple melodies, obviously, \u2018Fun, Fun Fun,\u2019 \u2018California Girls,\u2019 it's not that deep. So he could do the simple and the most complex music in the world, and there was nobody on his level in pop music.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cTurn that f---ing phone off! You and your f---ing phone!\u201d Barbagallo shouted at customers, as they screamed and exited the venue. \u201cGet out of my f---ing restaurant!\u201d\n\nHe stands over the customer, admonishing him, before shouting profanities at the group, pulling their tablecloth, smashing the remaining plates and glasses.\n\nFootage obtained by this masthead shows one of the customers recording a video message to his partner complaining about the spice of the food before celebrated chef Pietro Barbagallo looms in the corner of the clip.\n\nThey ordered wine and starters, but when the prawn pasta arrived, it was simply too spicy and the waitress agreed to replace the dish. The nasty turn the night then took was caught on camera.\n\nIt was a bustling Thursday evening at the heritage-listed terrace, with almost every white-clothed table filled as the trio took their seats. They were excited to try the Carlton restaurant that had recently gone viral on social media.\n\nDimmed lights, soft music and the smell of fresh sugo greeted the friends as they entered popular Italian eatery Kaprica for dinner.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nShe described two incidents as particularly memorable. She alleges Barbagallo once threw a pizza shovel at her head, then on a separate occasion exposed his genitals to her at his house after offering her cocaine and champagne.\n\n\u201cIt was relentless,\u201d she said. \u201cHe smashed plates on peoples\u2019 tables. He would shout all the time, throw things, smash glasses and plates.\u201d\n\nCarly Lauder worked for the celebrated chef in the early 2000s at his former restaurant, I Carusi in Brunswick. Having built a career in hospitality \u2013 where she still works today \u2013 Lauder said Barbagallo was by far the worst person she has ever worked for.\n\nCarly Lauder says Barbagallo exposed his genitals to her and threw a pizza shovel at her. Credit: Simon Schluter\n\nBarbagallo did not respond to repeated requests for comment or to a detailed list of emailed questions. When this masthead approached him at his restaurant this week again asking him to respond to the allegations, particularly of indecent exposure, he said, \u201cno, no, no\u201d before closing and locking the door.\n\nBarbagallo, who was credited by The Age in 2005 with kick-starting Melbourne\u2019s \u201cpizza revolution\u201d, also stands accused of indecent exposure, inappropriate sexual comments towards staff and financial mismanagement across his venues.\n\nInterviews with 19 current and former employees at Barbagallo\u2019s restaurants suggest this incident was not isolated, with allegations of aggressive outbursts stretching back decades. The claims come as the wider industry is struggling to overcome a historic work-hard-play-hard culture that critics say enabled poor conduct by those in positions of power.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him throw cutlery when he\u2019s mad, throw plates and smash them against the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary and dehumanising.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, several waitstaff have resigned from Kaprica citing Barbagallo\u2019s aggressive behaviour, including Petrea James, who said his outbursts were frequent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing this the whole time, and he\u2019s still being held up on a pedestal,\u201d she said.\n\nLauder decided to tell her story after The Age\u2019s Good Food published a positive review of Kaprica last month .\n\nThis account was corroborated through interviews with three people Lauder told at the time.\n\n\u201cHe disappeared then returned shaking his dick in everyone\u2019s face,\u201d Lauder said. \u201cThat was the only time he took his clothes off, but he made lewd disgusting sexual gestures towards all of us all the time. It was way before #MeToo. None of us ever thought to push back.\u201d\n\nOne customer was later filming a video message to send to his partner about his \u201cburnt lips\u201d, when Barbagallo confronted the table.\n\nKaprica in Carlton has seen a wave of new bookings after a viral TikTok campaign. Credit: Photograph by Chris Hopkins\n\n\u201cAll the pasta was running down the wall,\u201d said one witness.\n\nWhen the waitress returned to the kitchen to deliver the news, Barbagallo became enraged. He accused the customers of having eaten some of the pasta and smashed the ceramic plate against a kitchen wall.\n\nOne of the affected customers said the intensity of the chilli on the pasta made it \u201cinedible\u201d and that the waitress agreed to replace the dish as the complaint was not new \u2013 customers had complained about the spice before.\n\nThis masthead interviewed five eyewitnesses to Barbagallo\u2019s plate-smashing incident in April. They said he had appeared under a \u201ccloud\u201d throughout his shift.\n\nShe said his aggression quickly crossed a line, describing regular \u201coutbursts\u201d where he was \u201cshaking, pacing, throwing his arms around\u201d as he allegedly berated staff.\n\nWhile the incident came as a shock to customers, staff were not surprised. James joined Kaprica in mid-2024 and says she was warned Barbagallo had a \u201ctemper\u201d. She had worked with unpredictable bosses before in hospitality, and needed the money, so took the job.\n\n\u201cThe workers told us it was definitely not the customers\u2019 fault,\u201d one witness told this masthead. \u201cI was like, surely it wasn\u2019t the owner. The place is so well-known. We were like, \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom outside the restaurant, two witnesses saw a chair fly out the front door towards the customer. Two waitresses were seen exiting the venue, one in tears.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly awkward,\u201d one witness said. \u201cThe music was playing but everyone was shocked and disturbed.\u201d\n\nHis \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d was heard from the street. One witness thought \u201ca homeless person was in there attacking someone\u201d. Inside, the usually bustling restaurant fell silent.\n\n\u201cHe would say things like \u2018you\u2019re all f---ing idiots and I\u2019m the biggest idiot for hiring you all\u2019. Your blood would run cold,\u201d she said.\n\nAccounts of Barbagallo\u2019s volatile behaviour were supported by almost all staff interviewed by this masthead, who separately claimed he would have \u201cmelt-downs\u201d, \u201cscreaming matches\u201d and \u201cexplosions\u201d of anger.\n\nA dozen women who worked in various roles around Barbagallo backed these claims but declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.\n\nOne woman alleged he threw plates or \u201cpans of hot food\u201d every couple of weeks.\n\nAnother woman said she \u201cliterally had a plate thrown at me\u201d by Barbagallo.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some severe personality issues there,\u201d the woman said. \u201cHe\u2019s totally unhinged, totally.\u201d\n\nA third woman described an incident where Barbagallo allegedly held a plate above a customer\u2019s head and screamed: \u201cI\u2019m going to smash your head in if you don\u2019t f---ing leave my restaurant\u201d after the customer complained about slow service. \u201cAnd then he kind of switched back, was like, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother employee described feeling \u201cfrozen\u201d by his aggression. The staff taught each other to \u201cjust nod and look down\u201d until he stopped yelling, in episodes that appeared \u201cmanic\u201d and like he was \u201cstuck in a loop\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you apologise or even God forbid try to explain the mistake, he just gets angrier and angrier and angrier and angrier and reiterates the same point over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nJames said the outbursts made her feel anxious, as Barbagallo switched between abusive and friendly. \u201cI got the shakes,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, you get goosebumps. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nWhen James quit earlier this year, she sent a text message to Barbagallo, citing his \u201cserious aggression and conflict\u201d.\n\n\u201cI find the way you speak to your staff extremely inappropriate,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBarbagallo responded: \u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\nAnother staff member, who did not want to be named, sent a similar resignation text message this year, calling out Barbagallo\u2019s \u201cunacceptable behaviour\u201d and prior \u201coutbursts\u201d.\n\nHe responded: \u201cSorry you feel that way\u201d.\n\nComplaints about Barbagallo\u2019s aggressive behaviour date back to the early 2000s. Credit: Marina Oliphant\n\nFourteen former staff members alleged varying levels of sexually inappropriate behaviour from Barbagallo, ranging from comments about their appearances and over-sharing about his own sexual experiences.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Lauder alleged Barbagallo \u201calways spoke about sex\u201d, had sexual relationships with his employees, and openly talked about plans to hire attractive young women.\n\nOne former staff member, who quit last month after she was reduced to tears by Barbagallo multiple times, was critical of this language.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of sickening to me, even still, just because of how sexualised I know all the service staff are in the way that is almost like an active decision when they\u2019re hired.\u201d\n\nThe employee said Barbagallo would \u201clook you up and down\u201d before hiring staff and often turned away men with experienced resumes.\n\nJames supported this position, saying Barbagallo often hired women in their early 20s who worked part-time while studying nearby at Melbourne University.\n\nShe said Barbagallo routinely commented on the appearance of customers and waitstaff, including herself when she dyed her hair a darker red colour.\n\n\u201cHe told me I looked goth, really good. He wouldn\u2019t stop commenting on it. It was just classic creepy boss vibes,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cThen he would always point out other people who dressed goth to me, and then tell me he wanted to do bad things to them. That he knew he shouldn\u2019t like them but he does and that just makes it all the more enticing.\u201d\n\nAnother former waitress alleged Barbagallo also made sexualised comments to her, including telling her she could work fewer shifts because \u201cessentially men would pay for my company \u2026 And I could sell my body\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising at the time but not infrequent,\u201d she said.\n\nThe same woman recalled him saying \u201cshe\u2019s so hot I would f--- her\u201d about a customer, and sharing stories about his sexual experiences and drug-taking.\n\n\u201cIt became common knowledge to know his ex-lovers\u2019 full names because he would talk about it,\u201d she said.\n\nBarbagallo in 2004 at his first Melbourne restaurant, I Carusi. Credit: John Woudstra\n\nThree employees who worked with Barbagallo at I Carusi in the early 2000s said Barbagallo had sexual relationships with much younger staff.\n\n\u201cI remember at the time being like why the f--- are her parents not stepping in here?\u201d one former employee said, noting the staff, though younger, were still consenting adults.\n\n\u201cHe was so inappropriate with all the young staff, myself included. He\u2019d touch your back when you walked past him. He was so creepy. It was such a gnarly vibe.\u201d\n\nBarbagallo came onto Melbourne\u2019s culinary scene in 1998, opening a no-frills pizza restaurant in Brunswick East, I Carusi.\n\nHe expanded over the years to open venues in St Kilda and Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where complaints of aggressive and inappropriate behaviour continued to mount.\n\nBarbagallo was declared bankrupt in 2011, according to corporate documents, and shut his Lonsdale Street restaurant and ended his involvement with all I Carusi restaurants.\n\nPublic bankruptcy documents obtained by this masthead that were signed in June 2011 show Barbagallo had $500 to his name and debts of $1,223,631, including $267,000 to Carusi and $40,000 to Mercedes-Benz Finance.\n\nWhen he opened Kaprica in Carlton soon after, Barbagallo reportedly \u201cslaved away solo in the kitchen\u201d for the first six months \u201calmost like he was doing penance\u201d.\n\nBut staff claim there was a haphazard approach to managing the restaurant\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cThe entire business was in cash,\u201d said one person who worked as Barbagallo\u2019s informal assistant in 2015. \u201cSo we were paid in cash, payments from customers were in cash. I would drive my bike to deposit like $15,000 worth of cash and he would pay his rent and children\u2019s lessons out of that money.\u201d\n\nKaprica has long been popular with locals, and moved to a two-storey venue on Grattan Street as demand expanded over the years. However, bookings from new customers have rocketed in the past 18 months after Kaprica engaged marketing firm Einwick and social media producer Hano Lokman to advertise the venue.\n\nLokman\u2019s videos used off-beat scripts and dim lighting to create short fictional narratives to promote the restaurant, clocking up hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok. He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMultiple current and former staff said the social media craze strained the business as Barbagallo would over-book, causing long waits for tables or service.\n\n\u201cWhen it started getting busy, it [aggression] was more frequent because he literally couldn\u2019t manage the restaurant and manage himself,\u201d alleged one former employee.\n\nWhile Kaprica paid an hourly rate higher than average, more than a dozen employees said Barbagallo does not provide payslips and transfers wages directly to bank accounts using calculations from paper time sheets.\n\nTwo employees became worried about Barbagallo\u2019s failure to pay superannuation and tax on their wages last year, and were given access to his books for a day in an attempt to solve their issues.\n\n\u201cIt was sheets of random bits of paper strewn around the place, and there were things like where there would be a month missing from this person\u2019s pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it took months for it to go to the accountant and be in the accounts. It was just an incredible level of procrastination.\u201d\n\nScreenshots from a WhatsApp group of Kaprica staff show conversations about payment irregularities were common.\n\n\u201cSorry to keep asking but does anyone have news on tax?\u201d one employee wrote last September.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d another responded. \u201cLast I heard he messaged his accountant and he never got a response \u2026 Not really a good enough reason, it\u2019s his responsibility.\u201d\n\nText messages show another employee was sacked this month after they told Barbagallo they were underpaid for public holiday shifts and pushed for their full entitlements.\n\n\u201cYep there is a mistake on my behalf which I\u2019ll fix tonight,\u201d Barbagallo responded. \u201cAlso you should learn some manners. And finally I think it best you found employment elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe employee responded: \u201cManners?? Why am I being fired?\u201d\n\nIt took weeks of messages for Barbagallo to pay the employee, who followed up multiple times.\n\nAnother former employee said she saw text messages on the restaurant phone from a former staff member begging for superannuation payments months after they had left.\n\n\u201cWe would get text after text from this employee who was like, \u2018Come on Pietro \u2026 It\u2019s been six months. How are you still not replying to me? Please.\u2019 He was ignoring her.\u201d\n\nLauder said these were longstanding practices and behaviours that Barbagallo needed to be held accountable for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 31 years. I\u2019ve worked as a chef, front-of-house, late-night cocktail bars.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is ever any reason for anyone to lose their shit, shout at people, throw things. Nothing is ever that stressful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dinner. He\u2019s not saving lives. If you can\u2019t handle it, you\u2019re in the wrong job.\u201d",

        "text": "Loading Associate professor in clinical psychology at The University of Melbourne, Isabel Krug, whose research focuses on eating disorders, says while anyone in any sport can develop an eating disorder, certain \u201caesthetic-based\u201d sports like figure skating and gymnastics, which privilege thinness, pose a greater risk factor for athletes. \u201cThese can reinforce disordered eating behaviours, especially, restricting food and orthorexic tendencies [obsession with healthy food], and body dissatisfaction.\u201d The environment of high-performance sports \u2013 in which athletes\u2019 bodies are their tools \u2013 can also contribute. \u201cThe way we measure athletes\u2019 bodies, the way we talk about their bodies, the language we use, are all really important factors,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cSport can add fuel to the fire.\u201d Still, Jeacocke says work is being done to better understand the complex relationship between high-performance sport and eating disorders. In 2020, the AIS and National Eating Disorders Collaboration published a statement on the topic, outlining guidelines for athletes, coaches, support staff, clinicians and sporting organisations. Jeacocke, who co-authored the statement, says preventing and identifying eating disorders in athletes requires a multipronged approach. \u201cIt\u2019s taking a really holistic view of athletes, looking at their mental and physical health. So, how do we optimise health and well-being to maximise performance?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to win gold medals, we want to break world records, yes, but how we do that is super important,\u201d she says. Three athletes \u2013 current and former \u2013 share their thoughts on why elite sport can be such a breeding ground for disordered eating, and what finally set them on the path to recovery. \u2018I just needed someone to sit and listen\u2019 Gorry with daughter Harper. She says pregnancy and motherhood played a role in overcoming her eating disorder. Credit: FIFA via Getty Images While football is not a weight-based sport, Gorry says the culture of regular weigh-ins, body fat checks and density scans contributed to a creeping obsession over food and the way she looked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much pressure every day to perform, to be a certain body shape and to be at our peak,\u201d she says. Gorry, who became a Butterfly Foundation ambassador in 2024, would like to see less focus on weight and a more nuanced understanding of women\u2019s health. \u201cAs footballers, it doesn\u2019t make sense to be weighing in. Everyone\u2019s going to weigh differently, being female athletes, you could put on 3 kilograms while you\u2019ve got your period, and we don\u2019t talk about the reasons why,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a number at the end of the day, it should be how you feel in your body and how you\u2019re performing.\u201d So, what was the turning point that set her on the path to recovery?\n\nAlongside clinical treatment and pregnancy, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her body, support from teammates helped. \u201cA big part of it was actually my roommate in the Matildas at the time, Michelle [Heyman]. She noticed and asked, \u2018I can see that you\u2019re struggling. Are you okay? I\u2019m here for you\u2019.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed. I didn\u2019t need someone to try and help me. I just needed someone to sit there and listen and point me in the right direction without pushing me.\u201d Now a mother to Harper and Koby, she says her experience with an eating disorder has shaped how she parents, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation Clara [Markstedt, Gorry\u2019s wife] and I both have all the time around food, or even when Harper\u2019s looking at herself in the mirror, just making sure we\u2019re validating her in the right way.\u201d\n\n\u2018My self-worth was attached to football\u2019 In 2010, Brock McLean, now 39, had just moved from Melbourne Football Club to Carlton. Having recently suffered injuries, he had lost speed on the field. His coaches recommended he lose weight. \u201cAgainst the advice of nutritionists and doctors, I agreed to do it because I was so desperate to get back to playing footy. My mental health issues at the time was that my self-worth was attached to football,\u201d he says. Former AFL footballer Brock McLean. Credit: Lus Enrique Ascui \u201cI was at the very apex of professional football. You couldn\u2019t go any higher than that. So I developed a really unhealthy way of viewing myself.\u201d\n\nMcLean embarked on a restrictive meal plan. He would suppress cravings for certain foods for weeks on end before giving in and bingeing, then overtraining and eventually using laxatives. Loading These behaviours dovetailed with anxiety, depression and addiction, and he developed bulimia nervosa. Young men and boys are often underrepresented in conversations about body image and eating disorders, despite the fact around one-third of those who suffer from an eating disorder are male. McLean says the stigma around eating disorders and mental illness in men\u2019s sport meant he was afraid to seek help.\n\n\u201cI was really uncomfortable opening up to people. I just couldn\u2019t do it because I felt like it was emasculating, particularly for an eating disorder.\u201d After retiring in 2014 and moving into the corporate world, the self-worth he had derived from football transferred to climbing the corporate ladder. But through seeing a psychologist, the tide has slowly started to turn. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you look like, what your job title is, how much money you make. You\u2019re a good person, you treat people well, you\u2019re a great dad and husband,\u201d he says. \u2018I only can imagine what I could have achieved\u2019\n\nDr Jennifer Hamer was diagnosed with anorexia at age 12. A promising endurance runner in her home country of England who represented Great Britain at the European Championships, her eating disordered progressed with her sporting career. \u201cI was always carrying my eating disorder with me, which I believe held me back a lot,\u201d she says, explaining she was frequently getting injured and spending time at the physio in rehab. Dr Jennifer Hamer, a former endurance runner, now works with athletes to prevent eating disorders. Credit: Steven Siewert \u201cMy pure love for the sport became really, really scarred by the fact that it was now being controlled by an eating disorder.\u201d While Hamer says it\u2019s difficult to say whether she would have developed an eating disorder had she not been involved in sports, she feels her coaches were ill-equipped to support her and her family.\n\nLoading \u201cThere\u2019s a point in your eating disorder in the early stages where it doesn\u2019t affect you negatively \u2026 I was winning races, so they were like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s winning. But let\u2019s keep pushing her harder.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t going to say anything because I was loving it because I was abiding by the eating disorder rules, and I was getting away with all the things that I wanted to do.\u201d At 22, Hamer\u2019s eating disorder meant she was so weak she could no longer run, and she was admitted to an inpatient clinic. There, she was given a career-ending diagnosis: she had osteoporosis from years of disordered eating. But for Hamer, now 33, it\u2019s only in the past four to five years she\u2019s really entered a space of recovery. She\u2019s also discovered a love for ocean swimming which allows her to indulge her love for endurance sports.",

The Australia-South Africa Test match has been played by 22 cricketers re-acquainting themselves with red balls and the concept of a game going for five days.\n\nIt\u2019s not their fault that they\u2019re not ready: a lack of readiness has been built into its design, as if the powers of international cricket want to look like they\u2019re saving the Test format while doing everything they can to undermine it. Imagine if a football World Cup final were played as a one-off, out-of-season friendly for the benefit of Jeff Bezos. Not even FIFA could screw up that badly.\n\nNone of South Africa\u2019s players had taken part in a first-class game of cricket in the past five months. One, Lungi Ngidi, last bowled a red ball in a match in August 2024. (He looked a tad rusty.) Three of the Australians had played some county cricket in England last month, but for the rest, their last first-class cricket was three to six months ago.\n\nRusty? Just a bit. Australian viewers might be a bit rusty too. Those who wanted to watch the game had to pinch their noses, hold their breath and submerge themselves in the swamp that is Amazon. For the Test match not to be protected by anti-siphoning laws gives a pretty good idea of how Australian regulatory and broadcasting interests rate it.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In its past 31 games since the 2023 VFL grand final, Werribee have had seven players drafted to the AFL. It\u2019s a staggering strike rate, born of the most basic principles. \u201cThis is like a country local footy club that plays at a higher level,\u201d says coach Jimmy Allan, who hails from down the road at Lara and played for Werribee in the early 2000s before a storied SANFL career. His assistant Kyle Hartigan hits another note. \u201cWe\u2019re a community club \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have this without them,\u201d he says, crediting not just the people of Werribee but sprawling Wyndham City, the fastest-growing municipality in Australia. Werribee CEO Mark Penaluna with senior players (L-R) Jesse Clark, Renee Tierney, Maddie Di Cosmo and Dom Brew. Credit: Paul Jeffers Michael Barlow, poster boy for late-bloomers who was drafted to Fremantle from Werribee in 2010, needs no prompting to join the chorus. \u201cThe Werribee Football Club has been the most important organisation in my life.\u201d If community, connection and care underpin Werribee, the product of the 1965 amalgamation of four local clubs also boasts an asset almost as constant as the ancient river red gums that flank its Chirnside Park home. Mark Penaluna, in his 22nd year as CEO, is the heartbeat of the club. \u201cAnyone who has been associated with local footy, we\u2019re just an extension of that, we\u2019re just talking bigger numbers,\u201d Penaluna says. To be a community club, he reckons, means leaving your ego at the door. \u201cWe understand we\u2019re not just here to win a game of footy, this is something people look forward to each week \u2013 training, games, sharing the wins and losses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery footballer starts at a local club, where much is done by few. When they arrive at Werribee, it\u2019s made clear that everyone \u2013 from the office to maintenance to the property steward \u2013 makes up the club. \u201cIf you see a broom and the floor\u2019s dirty, the expectation is you pick the broom up, give it a sweep, and make it clean for the next person.\u201d Many people whose lives are enriched here never lace a football boot. Wyndham Community Education runs eight English classes each week, making the club an early connection point for new arrivals to the area. On Sundays, Anglican followers of Sojourners Church gather for services held by pastor Andrew Seedhom, who is also club chaplain. Loading On game days, Penaluna spends half an hour on the gate before Seedhom relieves him, greeting players\u2019 families and Werribee\u2019s fans. Everyone is included in successes little and large, from office staff to sponsors to the volunteers who keep the wheels of community clubs turning. For Penaluna, football and its importance to community are ingrained. His father captain-coached Port Melbourne Colts. As a five-year-old, he had two game-day jobs: listen to the opposition coach\u2019s address and report back; and in quarters played with no added time, stand behind the goals and get the ball back to the umpires ASAP if the Colts were trailing. \u201cAnd if we were in front, kick the hell out of it the other way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe ran the Western Region league for five years before arriving at Werribee in 2003. His first game-day task was helping volunteers George and Jimmy drag the barbecue out of the showers under the old grandstand, so the umpires could get changed. There was no canteen; the barbie was a major source of income. \u201cWe had one desktop computer, and if it rained we had to put bubble wrap over it because there was a hole in the roof and possums living up there.\u201d CEO Mark Penaluna and community development manager Majok Ngong at Chirnside Park. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui His staff consisted of one part-time venue manager. The club\u2019s 2025 season guide lists Penaluna as one of 28 employees. More people work in community roles than once worked for the entire club. Welfare manager Damien Frankling has been around since 2008, chaplain Seedhom for the past four years. \u201cHaving those constants helps enormously, honest conversations and all that stuff,\u201d Penaluna says. Facilities help. In 2008, the club went to council with a proposed upgrade that had cost close to $12 million upon completion a decade later. Income is drawn from Wyndham entertainment venues, with $300,000 put back into the community annually, including sponsoring every football club in the municipality. \u201cWe agreed with council that we\u2019ll continue to provide these programs and extend them, and make sure we only charge community organisation rates not commercial,\u201d Penaluna says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWerribee has been a \u201cstandalone\u201d VFL club since 2018, after affiliations with Western Bulldogs and North Melbourne. The latter endures through the North Melbourne Werribee Kangaroos in the VFLW and \u201cThe Huddle\u201d, which has delivered programs to more than 50,000 young people since 2016 to strengthen education and employment outcomes. The club hosts English language classes for new migrants. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui For Barlow, who coached the Bees to runners-up in 2023 before Allan brought home the club\u2019s second premiership last year, being standalone is crucial to success. In training together throughout summer, bonds and trust are built and players improve by challenging each other. Playing every home game at a different venue \u2013 from Wangaratta to Torquay \u2013 during the 2017 renovations fostered an \u201canyone, anywhere, anytime\u201d zeal. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t standalone, some of the guys I played with just wouldn\u2019t play,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cThey\u2019d go and try and find connection and community and togetherness at a local club.\u201d He regards Shaun Mannagh, drafted by Geelong in 2023 aged 25, as \u201cthe most club-oriented person I\u2019ve met in football\u201d. Loading With VFL rivals Williamstown and Port Melbourne to the east and Geelong to the west, Werribee must be creative in their recruiting. There are enough Geelong-based players to warrant a van (they spin a key to see who drives), while leagues to the north like Ballarat, Ovens and Murray and Goulburn Valley produce players who fuel the country vibe. Allan chuckles at the notion that developing footballers so well surely equates to a queue of Werribee wannabes stretching along Watton St. Even in a competitive market, he doesn\u2019t use recent draft success as a carrot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would never say, \u2018Come here and we\u2019ll get you drafted.\u2019 If a club thinks they need them on their list they\u2019ll find a way. Our job is to help them be the best player and best person they can be. I know it\u2019s a cliche, but we\u2019re genuinely invested in doing that. \u201cWith the five who\u2019ve gone [to AFL clubs] in my time here, not once did they ask, \u2018What do I need to do to get drafted?\u2019 Their questions were around, \u2018What can I do to help our team be the best we can be?\u2019 It\u2019s about playing your role and doing it better than anybody else. That\u2019s why these guys are getting a chance.\u201d Zac Banch, picked up by North in the mid-season draft. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Smiling again, Allan adds, \u201cWe\u2019re big on cliches.\u201d Hartigan\u2019s story offers a compelling blueprint. Overlooked as an 18-year-old after trying to be something he wasn\u2019t, he spent three years at Werribee \u201cand just went back to what I was good at, which was nullifying opponents\u201d. Eventually, Adelaide identified a need in defence, \u201cand I was in the right place, right time, playing my role\u201d. He played 135 games for the Crows and Hawthorn. The cliche won out.

Jennifer Soo Previous Slide Next Slide We don\u2019t celebrate the works burger enough. Beetroot-stained roll. Pre-sliced \u201ctasty\u201d cheese. Shredded iceberg. Pineapple. Egg. Your choice of sauce. Although there\u2019s no clear consensus as to how or why the burger came about (although a surplus of tinned goods created by the opening of Edgell and Golden Circle canneries in the 1940s might have had something to do with it), its unknown creator is up there with Peter Russell-Clarke and Grandma Poss in terms of their influence on everyday Australian food. I\u2019m quite serious about this \u2013 the \u201cAussie\u201d burger is one of the few culinary creations we can claim as legitimately unique. Try finding beetroot, pineapple and barbecue sauce between bread on any other continent. I bring all this up because I may have found the best works burger in Australia. Wingello\u2019s $18 burger with the lot. Jennifer Soo I say \u201cmay\u201d because it\u2019s an impossible claim to confirm without visiting every fish and chip shop. Who knows what takeaway lurks near Beechworth or Kalgoorlie or the industrial sheds of Croydon Park? (I\u2019m also conscious of Paul\u2019s Famous Hamburgers and its faithful in Sylvania.) But gee, Wingello Village Store and Post Office knows its way around a spatula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to David Bruggeman, who runs the one-stop Southern Highlands shop with his family, the general store\u2019s dates back to 1865. Wingello is home to about 600 people, and Bruggeman and his wife Lana took over its only shop 16 years ago, extending the mail, newspaper and basic grocery services to include a cafe with \u201csimply good food\u201d. \u201cYou won\u2019t find avocado or Turkish bread or any of that stuff here,\u201d he tells me. Wingello Village Store and Post Office owner David Bruggeman. Jennifer Soo You will, however, find a formidable selection of milk bottles, caramel buds and chocolate freckles along the counter, and a menu heavy with truck-stop classics plus a whipped cream-topped sundae. If the indoor fire is going, marshmallow roasting is encouraged. I suspect the BLT is a paragon of the form, and the cinnamon toast is a super-duper breakfast, but the $18 works burger is the headline act. The soft, flat bun comes from Bryant\u2019s Bakery in Goulburn. Local butchers supply the beef and house-cured bacon. Lettuce, tomato and free-range eggs come from nearby farmers; the pineapple and beetroot comes from a can. Sauce is from a bottle, unless you ask for the house-made mayonnaise, but that\u2019s better saved for chips. Tomato sauce on an Aussie burger, forever and ever, amen. (The only good thing about ETA Original Barbecue is the bottle design. Yes, yes, I\u2019ll begin the process of revoking my citizenship now.) (From left) Martin, Zach, James, David and Peter Bruggeman. Jennifer Soo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, all this adds up to a tower of fresh flavour where each bite is underlined by a different ingredient. The bacon is generous. The onions, translucent but not browned. It may take a few bites until you hit pineapple. The 130-gram patty is lean on fat, which some burger purists will hate, but I don\u2019t mind finishing the thing and still feeling human. The perfect trinity of salty, sweet and lightly pickled. I brought a second burger back to Moss Vale for my partner, who was less keen to leave the throw-rug of our Airbnb for the half-hour trip to Wingello. By this time, all the components have had more time to mingle and develop in their white paper bag. Brilliant with half a glass of last night\u2019s gamay at 11:30am. A one-stop Southern Highlands shop. Jennifer Soo Thanks go to two-time Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championship finalist, and taco chef, Toby Wilson for alerting me to the burger three weeks ago. Wilson only discovered it after seeing an ad for the cafe before The Penguin Lessons at Bowral\u2019s Empire Cinema. (NB: The Bruggeman family has a YouTube channel where you can watch all their house-made cinema ads, dating back to 2020. It is absolutely worth your time.)

A pulsing track that sees the group reckoning with the past and thinking about the future: \u201cAnd now the question is: will you remain the same?\u201d raps Jerome \u2018J Emz\u2019 Misa over a heavy beat. \u201cOr are you willing to do whatever it takes to change?\u201d Change has been the one constant in OneFour\u2019s turbulent 10-year history as Australia\u2019s most prominent hip-hop outfit, a period defined by upheaval, controversy, prison time and hype \u2013 anything but stability. Since forming in 2014, the all-Pasifika rap crew from Mount Druitt in Western Sydney have experienced a decade of turbulence. Credit: Mridula Amin Formed in 2014, the all-Pasifika rap crew from Mount Druitt in Western Sydney was initially composed of five members \u2013 brothers Jerome and Pio \u2018YP\u2019 Misa, Salec \u2018Lekks\u2019 Su\u2019a, Dahcell \u2018Celly\u2019 Ramos, and Spencer \u2018Spenny\u2019 Magalogo. They quickly became the face of Australia\u2019s drill movement, a sub-genre of hip-hop that emerged from Chicago a decade ago. It is known for its faster, heavier sound and raw lyrics, often depicting gang culture. Adopting this style, OneFour infused it with a uniquely Western Sydney flavour, references to \u2018eshays\u2019 and \u2018lads\u2019 speaking to a subculture born from the very same streets they grew up in. It didn\u2019t take long for the group to tap into viral success, with songs like 2018\u2019s What You Know and 2019\u2019s Spot The Difference going platinum on the ARIA charts and racking up hundreds of millions of streams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the buzz grew, so too did the accolades. ARIA nominations followed, while hip-hop superstars, including Skepta, Dave, A$AP Ferg, and the Kid Laroi, voiced their support for OneFour\u2019s warts-and-all portrait of street life in Mount Druitt. \u201cMy district has too much drillers, like who wants it? Like who wants war with Sydney\u2019s realest?\u201d Spot The Difference, OneFour But their meteoric rise was halted in 2019 when Lekks, Celly and YP were jailed for a pub brawl. That same year, a national tour was cancelled after venues began pulling out, something OneFour attributed to pressure from the police and confirmation that the group was being monitored by two elite police units \u2013 Strike Force Raptor, created to hunt underground criminal networks, and Strike Force Imbara, which investigates gang feuds. In a widely circulated voice memo supplied to the ABC, Sergeant Nathan Trueman from the Raptor squad promised, \u201cI\u2019m going to use everything in my power to make your life miserable until you stop doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d The constant noise around OneFour only seemed to boost their infamy. Their shows continued to be cancelled while their streaming numbers skyrocketed (they have an impressive 2.4 million monthly listeners on Spotify). OneFour have regularly been targeted by police and prevented from performing. Credit: YouTube The release of a 2024 Netflix documentary, Against All Odds, broadened their reach yet reinforced the idea that the story of OneFour had become more important than the music they produced. \u201cExactly right,\u201d says J Emz. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we needed a change. We\u2019re about the music, and we want people to know that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sitting with J Emz, Celly and Spenny in a back room of Sony Music\u2019s headquarters in Sydney\u2019s CBD. There are bowls of lollies on the table and slabs of soft drinks, but no one eats or drinks anything. This is the new look OneFour after a lineup change. YP left the group last year after becoming ordained as a Christian priest, while Lekks remains part of OneFour but was deported to New Zealand following his four-year prison sentence.

Alongside him is Celly, who was recently released after serving five years of his 10-year sentence for the brawl. Next to me is Spenny, who is softly spoken and polite but visibly uncomfortable with being interviewed. I ask them about that first track, Change, and whether the lyrics were born out of a challenge they set themselves. \u201cFor sure, I don\u2019t think any of us can pretend we haven\u2019t made mistakes,\u201d says J Emz. \u201cBut we\u2019ve grown up a lot. So much has happened in our career to knock us off track \u2013 some of that is our fault, some of it isn\u2019t, but we\u2019ve gotten much better at holding each other accountable.\u201d What does that look like? \u201cThere have been some heated chats for sure,\u201d admits J Emz, while Celly and Spenny nod in agreement. \u201cSometimes I got to remind the boys what they\u2019re going back to if this doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRapping about Sydney gang subcultures, OneFour\u2019s focus on the grittiness of the streets \u2013 violence, drug-dealing and run-ins with the police \u2013 blurred the lines between their art and life. Credit: Michael Candrick No one knows that better than Celly, whose incarceration meant he missed much of the album\u2019s development. Instead, he worked on his lyrics in prison and recorded once he got out. \u201cThe journey for me was different [with this album] being in jail; you can either sit there and waste your days or try to use the time wisely, so I started writing a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cAll you have is time to think about what you\u2019ve done to end up there and what you\u2019ll do not to go back, so the minute I got out, I was straight into it.\u201d \u201cI dropped that ball, time out, they threw me inside, I\u2019m back on the bench.\u201d Celly on Look At Me Now\u2019s Family The result is Look At Me Now, a sprawling 15-track album on which the group collaborates with several high-profile UK drill rappers, including Nemzzz, Headie One, and Abra Cadabra. The record also sees OneFour collaborate for the second time with the Kid Laroi on Distant Strangers. Laroi and OneFour first crossed paths when they were both coming up and have remained close throughout Laroi\u2019s success, with OneFour the opening act on his most recent tour of Australia. \u201cI get inspired by Laroi every time, any opportunity we get to be around him is a learning for us,\u201d says Spenny. \u201cThis is a guy on top, and he\u2019s still the same kid we knew from back in the day.\u201d OneFour with a young The Kid Laroi (third from the right) in Redfern.

According to the group, NSW police continue to pressure venues by demanding extra user-pays-police (where officers are hired to police a private event paid for by the venue), leaving venues unwilling to host the band in their hometown.

However, the decision as to whether an event will proceed lies with the relevant venue.\u201d Loading J Emz admits that, for the first time, he\u2019d encourage NSW Police to listen to their music. \u201cThe message is: we\u2019re different now, we\u2019re good people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be defined by what I did,\u201d adds Celly. \u201cI served my time, suffered the consequences, and this is the next chapter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: The Lott/Supplied\n\nOne lucky Aussie\u2019s life has just changed forever after taking out Powerball\u2019s incredible $100 million jackpot. Australia\u2019s newest multi-millionaire was the only winner in tonight\u2019s draw, which was Powerball\u2019s biggest jackpot of the year.\n\nThe jackpot doubled after last week's $50m draw failed to be won. While not many details are known about the winner yet, they now officially share the title of Australia\u2019s third-highest lottery winner.\n\nWhat is known is that the ticket was purchased in either NSW or the ACT.\n\nWith this week's massive offering, officials from The Lott anticipated up to half of all adults in the country would be purchasing a ticket.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTonight's winning numbers are: 28, 10, 3, 16, 31, 14 and 21, with the all-important Powerball number 6.\n\nPowerball\u2019s last big winner took home $30 million\n\nThe last big win was back in early May, when a man from Cessnock in NSW became an instant multi-millionaire with an incredible $30m win.\n\nHe burst into uncontrollable laughter when he heard the good news, and said he saw the win as a sign of good things to come after having a \"rough trot\" lately.\n\n\u201cI just had this ticket on the fridge. I was looking at it this afternoon and thought, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be lovely to win\u2019,\" he told The Lott.\n\n\u201cThe ticket was there with all the bills. There will be no more worrying about bills now. I don\u2019t care if I get a bill now!\"\n\nLast $100m winner shares how life has changed\n\nOnly six Aussies know what it's like to win $100m. One of those lucky winners was a Queensland woman who took home half of the record-breaking $200m Powerball jackpot last February.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReflecting on her win more than a year on, the new millionaire revealed she's since embraced a sea change, relocating from the suburb of Hawthorne in Brisbane to a serene coastal home.\n\n\"I often speak with my partner about the version of us from last year to now, and if only we knew what was to come,\" she said.\n\n\"On a day-to-day basis, not a huge amount has changed. I still get up for the 6am gym session, and the dog still needs to be walked and fed. The longer-term vision we have for our life is slowly coming together.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
