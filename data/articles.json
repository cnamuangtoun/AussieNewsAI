(Getty)\n\nNext week, the peak union body will argue for shorter working hours and the implementation of a four-day work week across Australia at the Economic Reform Roundtable in Canberra.\n\nIt's a plan ACTU President Michele O'Neil says would benefit both workers and businesses.\n\n\"People want to be able to have a life as well as be able to work, and they don't want to live to work,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"We don't want to see improvements just go to profits, just go to shareholders or executive bonuses.\"\n\nThe ACTU has proposed \ufeffbusinesses introduce a four-day week where possible and, where that model isn't appropriate, implement more rostered days off, increased annual leave, and redesigned rosters that prioritise employees' work-life balance.\n\nThese are top 10 'best' companies to work for in Australia View Gallery\n\nResearch from Australia and abroad suggests this plan would \ufeffboost performance, reduce burnout and improve employee health and retention across the country.\n\nIt could also help shorten the gap between productivity growth and wage growth in Australia.\n\nAnalysis from the Centre for Future Work revealed that if real wages had grown at the same rate as productivity since 2000, Aussies would be making about $350 more per week in 2025.\n\n\"Wages improving is critically important for living standards, but workers having more time to live is also important,\" O'Neil said.\n\nA reduced work week would also benefit businesses.\n\n\"If we've got a better balance between our work life and our home life, then when we come to work, we're more effective, we're more able to focus, we're more able to get the job done,\" O'Neil said.\n\n\"All of these things are benefits for employers, and this is not just unions and the ACTU saying this.\"\n\nOne \ufeff2023 study of ten Australian companies trialling the four-day week revealed that 70 per cent reported higher productivity.\n\nThe other 30 per cent \ufeffreported productivity levels were the same as pre-trial.\n\nWant a pay rise? These jobs experienced the fastest salary growth this year View Gallery\n\nThe ACTU argues that businesses across the country could see similar productivity boosts if only they would invest in capital, research and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 people.\n\nBut some sectors disagree.\n\n\ufeffThe Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association (ARCA) said a four-day work week would slash productivity and take a toll on hospitality businesses, especially in CBD.\n\n\"We can't cram service into fewer days,\" ARCA CEO Wes Lambert said in a press release.\n\nHe said \"a blanket four-day rule\" would be \"a death blow for CBD caf\u00e9s already struggling\" as one in 10 currently face closure.\n\nREAD MORE: Dramatic arrest as Aussie airport temporarily locked down\n\n\ufeffThe Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association (ARCA) isn't keen on the idea.

(Supplied)\n\nRamia Abdo Sultan, the executive member of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, has been calling for action for her family members and others in Palestine.\n\nBut she said the government's recognition was merely a \"symbolic step\" that did not address the \ufeff\"immediate and imminent\" issues faced by Palestinians.\n\n\"[My family] received news about Australia, as well as various other countries around the world, recognising Palestine in the next month, and they said, 'We want to hear about our right to actually exist first before an ocean of recognition. We want to know that we have a right to live, a right to self-determination and autonomy and agency, like every other person around the world',\" she said.\n\n\"That's what Palestinians on the ground in Gaza are saying.\"\n\nMussa Hijazi, a lawyer who spent some of his childhood growing up in Palestine, went further to call the prime minister's recognition \"a bit more sinister\" than a \"distraction\".\n\n\"Number one: it's very late. Two: it's symbolic. Three: it's creating a distraction from what is actually going on,\" he said. \ufeff\n\n\"We end up with this half-arsed attempt to basically quieten the public down by proposing possibly recognising a state at some stage, later down the track, subject to conditions,\" he added.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says Australia will recognise a Palestinian state. (Nine)\n\nAlbanese's sudden shift in policy followed building international momentum, sparked on July 25 when France announced it would be the first G7 country to move to recognise Palestine at the upcoming UN meeting.\n\nAlbanese \ufeffthen held phone calls with the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBy August 3, a pro-Palestine protest saw a historic crowd of between 100,000 to 300,000 people march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge against the images of growing starvation in Gaza.\n\nAlbanese's decision has put him at odds with the United States, which was notified of Australia's plan to recognise Palestine ahead of the announcement. \ufeff\n\nOrganisers of the mass bridge protest accused the government of acting with political motivation, adding that recognition is meaningless without sanctions.\n\n\"This decision is not borne of principle, but of political heat,\" Palestine Action Group Sydney said.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. (Janie Barrett)\n\nPro-Palestine protesters have been calling for the government to go further, to sanction Israel and stop any arms trade with Israel.\n\n\"We don't want symbolic steps and moves. We want actual tangible actions that are going to stop Israel from killing people again,\" Sultan said. \ufeff\n\n\"Once we have got a ceasefire, once people are being fed, once the Israelis have withdrawn, we can talk about all sorts of things, including a two-state, but right now it's a distraction,\" Hijazi said.\n\nIsrael's security cabinet last week approved a plan to take over Gaza City, ramping up military action in the besieged enclave. \ufeff\n\nThe United Nations has warned that this plan would trigger more calamity in Gaza, causing the \"unbearable suffering of the population\".\ufeff\n\nThe \ufeffWorld Health Organisation said the number of starvation-related deaths and malnutrition rates have spiked, while the United Nations estimates that at least 1300 Palestinians have been killed trying to access food since May 27. \ufeff",

        "text": "A man on Queensland's Sunshine Coast says he and his neighbours have been forced into a \"horrible\" limbo as they wait to learn if the government will take their homes.\n\nShaun Taylor said he was told before last year's state election that his Mountain Creek home had been marked for resumption to allow for the eventual construction of a rail line.\n\nBut the LNP government said in March that it would renege on its election promise to build the line to Maroochydore, instead stopping construction at Birtinya and running a \"metro-style\" bus service the rest of the way as part of a new multi-billion-dollar public transport project dubbed The Wave.\n\nResidents told homes in way of major rail project Photo shows Man with paper in a garage A group of residents on Queensland's Sunshine Coast say they have been blindsided by a state government decision to redirect a major rail corridor through their properties.\n\nThat announcement was initially met with relief by about 10 property owners at Mountain Creek, including Mr Taylor.\n\nBut nearly six months on from The Wave announcement, and a year since discovering their homes were in the firing line, the residents are still struggling to get answers about the fate of their homes.\n\nMr Taylor said they were unable to move on with their lives until they did.\n\n\"It's horrible, your mental health is almost shot,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\nThe electrician settled in Causeway Court nine years ago with his young family.\n\nThey believed they had found their forever home, but Mr Taylor said they could not even sell it without losing a considerable amount of their initial housing investment.\n\nProperties along the impacted street were only built within the past decade. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jessica Ross)\n\n\"We thought, 'Oh, let's just move', but we spoke to an agent and they said you won't get your value for your property. If anything, they'll low-ball you,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\n\"There's two people down the street from us whose houses weren't even on the [resumption] list, they want to sell up and retire. But they can't because nobody's interested. They've had their house on the market for almost six months.\n\n\" Three friends just took their homes off the market because they weren't getting their value. \"\n\nWrong number, try again\n\nMr Taylor said he spoke to local member Brent Mickelberg in March but had not spoken to him since.\n\nInstead, residents received a letter which included a \"direct line\" to someone within the transport department to talk to about the project.\n\n\"First of all the number didn't work, and then when I did get through about three weeks ago they didn't even have a design team or a planning team,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\n\" We would like to know what's happening, not be kept in the dark. \"\n\nMr Mickelberg was not available for an interview.\n\nIn a statement, a Department of Transport and Main Roads spokesperson said investigations were still underway into a preferred corridor for The Wave's \"metro-style\" bus service.\n\nAn artist's impression of The Wave public transport system.

(Supplied: Better Transport Queensland)\n\nBut new alignments, including the one that left the Mountain Creek residents in the firing line, have been made in recent years to support the technical requirements for Queensland Rail to safely operate trains.\n\nAlex Jago from advocacy group Better Transport Queensland said he did not want give affected residents \"false hope\" but it was possible that buses could run along the original corridor.\n\n\"The difficulty of putting a train line into Maroochydore was one of the drivers for going to a bus solution there,\" Mr Jago said.\n\n\"A bus is a lot more forgiving in terms of how steep it can go, how tight it can turn.\"\n\nThe Sunshine Coast will host several Olympic and Paralympic events in 2032, including the marathon.

That does create massive travel demand, and a lot of those people will need to travel to Brisbane.\n\n\" The more time we can spend not stuck in traffic, the better. \"",

(Supplied: State Library of Western Australia)\n\nThe purchase was funded out of the Noongar Charitable Trust, established in 2011 by the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council (SWALSC), as a way to distribute funds to projects supporting members of the Noongar claimant group in Western Australia.\n\nBut the purchase was referred to the WA ombudsman after concerns were raised by community members.\n\nThese included that the property was acquired without independent market valuation, evidence of a credible business plan or assessment of the ongoing operational funding requirements.\n\nThe purchase at the time represented around 50 per cent of the trust's value.\n\nAccording to the ombudsman\u2019s investigation, headed up by WA's Charitable Trusts Commissioner Bevan Warner, a \"scoping\" report on the El Caballo site valued the property at $32 million, but it was unclear how this figure was obtained.\n\nThe ombudsman\u2019s investigation was led by WA's Charitable Trusts Commissioner Bevan Warner. (ABC News: Daniel Fermer)\n\nA retrospective valuation undertaken found it was worth just $5.9 million at the time of purchase, leaving a shortfall of more than $6 million on the $12 million purchase price.\n\nASX-listed Equity Trustees (EQT) was responsible for distributing the funds on behalf of the Noongar trust.\n\nTrustee 'breached duties'\n\nIn a report tabled in WA's parliament yesterday, Mr Warner found EQT \"breached its duties as trustee\" in authorising the purchase, and has ordered the firm to pay restoration.\n\nMr Warner found EQT relied too heavily on the representations of a former chief executive officer of the SWALSC who proposed the plan, and did not \"independently and impartially\" consider the viability of the project.\n\n\"The trustees owed to the Noongar people the obligation of examining the proposal in some depth,\" Mr Warner wrote.\n\n\" This obligation was not met. \"\n\nThe investigation came about after the national charity regulator, the Australian Charities Not-for-Profits Commission (ACNC), found governance needed to be improved at EQT, but did not take further action.\n\nThe WA attorney-general then referred the matter to the ombudsman.\n\nConcerns were raised by EQT about the proposed purchase at the time, including querying why the property had remained on the market for so long.\n\nThe organisation also questioned whether an independent valuation should have been obtained.\n\nBut according to Mr Warner's investigation, these concerns were addressed by a consultant possibly arranged by the then SWALSC chief executive Wayne Nannup, writing to EQT that \"we believe that this purchase price represents excellent value of the site\" and it was \"better off saving the cost of obtaining an independent valuation\".\n\nWayne Nannup was the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council's chief executive at the time. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\nThe investigation found EQT did not carry through with seeking further assessment of the property's value, choosing to rely on valuations provided by consultants arranged by the SWALSC.\n\n\"The Commission considers the suggestion that the trustee forgo obtaining an independent valuation in relation to the purchase of an asset purportedly worth in excess of $12 million and requiring an application of half of the corpus of the trust fund, to avoid the cost of those valuations, which are likely to be modest compared to the purchase price, is unreasonable in the circumstances,\" Mr Warner wrote.\n\nFindings disputed\n\nEQT has always maintained it undertook sufficient due diligence.\n\nIt told Mr Warner's office that the uniqueness of the El Caballo property meant a standard property valuation could not be obtained, and that it relied on experts put forward by the SWALSC.\n\n\"We carefully considered the housing project put forward by the [SWALSC] and notably the social value it would bring to the Noongar people in the years to come,\" EQT said.\n\nEquity Trustees said it was committed to the intent of the Noongar trust. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson for Equity Trustees said they remained committed to the intent of the Noongar trust, to support projects directly benefiting the Noongar community.\n\n\"At its heart, these funds were always intended to enable and support a community-driven social housing strategy to contribute to the alleviation of homelessness, support domestic violence victims, and provide rehabilitation and aged care facilities for the Noongar community,\" the statement said.\n\n\" We disagree with the findings of the report and we are considering next steps. \"\n\nEQT has until mid-September to respond to the commission's decision that they owe reparations.\n\nThe commission has also referred matters relating to the SWALSC to the federal regulator of Indigenous organisations.\n\n\"Throughout the Commission's investigation various concerns have been raised by community members and on the information at hand about the conduct of current and former office-holders of [SWALSC],\" the report states.\n\n\"The Commission has determined that information obtained during its investigation warrants a proactive referral to ORIC (the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations), and this will be undertaken once this report is provided to the Attorney-General.\"\n\nThe ABC has approached the SWALSC for comment.\n\nLoading...",

In July, the deal was approved by the Trump administration.\n\nIn Jobrani's mind, the axing of Colbert's show is no coincidence.\n\n\"I love Colbert \u2014 I get my news from Colbert \u2014 he makes the news fun,\" he told ABC News in a Melbourne interview last month, after landing from Los Angeles for the start of his latest Australian tour.\n\nStephen Colbert's The Late Show will end its 11-year-run on CBS in May 2026.

I couldn't make fun of the president of Iran, that wouldn't work,\" he said.\n\n\" We are slowly seeing, maybe even fastly seeing, the American democracy crumble, and I think now it falls on our shoulders more and more as comedians to make fun of Trump, poke at him. \"\n\nJobrani's family left Iran for the US in 1978, when he was six years old.\n\nIt was just a year before Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fell to Islamist rulers, and his family, like many others at the time, made the decision to flee.\n\nIn our interview, he talks of how growing up as an Iranian in California at that time was a struggle.\n\nBut he says it framed the backdrop to much of his comedy, which focuses on the weird and often hilarious events that occur as a child of immigrants.\n\nThe Shah of Iran and his wife visited the White House in 1962.

(ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nPeter Murphy has lived in Lancelin for over a decade and is on the town's District Community Association.\n\nThe association was the driving force behind building the lookout in 2019.\n\nMr Murphy said the $245,000 jointly funded lookout became iconic for the town.\n\n\"It's the only place [in Lancelin] with a magic 360-degree view,\" Mr Murphy said.\n\n\"People congregate on the lookout with a glass of wine and a deck chair to watch the [New Year's Eve] fireworks.\"\n\nSand has eroded away, leaving the lookout at risk of falling away. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nBut the decision to remove the lookout before it crumbled away did not feel real to Mr Murphy.\n\n\"It's terrible, we never expected this sort of event to happen,\" he said.\n\n\"I think I, amongst other people, have in mind that this is temporary and we will get the lookout back.\"\n\nThe beach along Lancelin shows visible impacts of coastal erosion. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nRemoval 'emotional'\n\nGingin Shire president Linda Balcombe said the removal of Lancelin's lookout would be emotional for many people.\n\n\"I've been really sad about this whole thing, I wish we could save it,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it will make us realise what we can lose if we don't look after it.\"\n\nLinda Balcombe says the community is disheartened to lose their local lookout. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nLast month, council sounded the alarm on coastal erosion as predicted strong winter tides were putting homes and businesses at risk.\n\nFollowing ABC coverage of the damage erosion was causing Lancelin, the state government funded $150,000 to build a natural coastal barrier, designed to protect a local hotel for another few years once in place.\n\nBut Ms Balcombe said she felt not everyone understood the constant threat erosion posed to coastal communities.\n\nContractors and shire workers met on Tuesday morning before demolition works of the lookout began. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\n\"I don't think people understand enough what's been happening up and down the coast,\" she said.\n\n\"Some [residents] are quite surprised [at the erosion] and others will say it's cyclic and the beach will come back.\n\n\"And I understand that, but at the moment it's a concern.\"\n\nOther coastal towns such as Port Denison are also threatened by coastal erosion. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nWA coast under threat\n\nJust under a three-hour drive north of Lancelin, the town of Port Denison has the same battle.\n\nSix years ago, the shire worked with state government to control erosion in the area with stabilised earth procedures, which mixed existing beach sand with water and cement.\n\nBut Irwin Shire President Mark Leonard said a stretch of 600 metres was now at risk of eroding away.\n\n\"Behind that 600m stretch is around $40 million worth of public infrastructure, which is our rec centre, pump track, aged care units, roads, car parks,\" he said.\n\nMark Leonard says more funding is needed to continue mitigation works to slow the impact of erosion in Port Denison. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nIn July last year, extreme coastal erosion forced the demolition of Geraldton's marine rescue building, which cost $880,000 to reopen in 2016.\n\nThe shoreline of Point Moore, where the building sat, was lost to vicious waves rapidly.\n\nSeeing what had happened in Geraldton and now Lancelin, Mr Leonard said further mitigation works were needed in Port Denison before it was too late.\n\n\"Our point is that something needs to be done before your buildings are falling into the ocean, not while they're falling into the ocean,\" he said.\n\nMark Leonard says he thought the marina was playing a role in how the beach was behaving. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nErosion management 'complex'\n\nUniversity of WA coastal engineering lecturer Arnold Van Rooijen said shoreline erosion was not a new issue for sites along the state's coast.\n\n\"We see around some of these shorelines that have features that stick out into the ocean \u2026 nature essentially wanting to straighten the coastline,\" Dr Van Rooijen said.\n\n\"So it's quite common around the world and Australia to see areas experience ongoing retreat.\"\n\nArnold Van Rooijen says understanding the causes of coastal erosion is complex. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis )\n\nBut Dr Van Rooijen said large coastal infrastructure like ports influenced coastal processes with \"erosion on one side and accretion on the other\".\n\nHe said although contributions to erosion along the coast had recurring themes, a holistic approach was needed to minimise impacts.\n\n\"[WA] os a very long coastline, it's sparsely populated and very complex with a lot of limestone \u2026 cliffs and marine ecosystems,\" Dr Van Rooijen said.\n\n\"I think governments are working very hard to deal with this issue, but it's definitely not straightforward and every site needs a tailored approach.\"",

Six balls later, Jade-Wellington brilliantly ran out Emma Lamb (25) and, at 4-83 with 59 balls gone, the game was done.\n\nJade-Wellington finished with 2-27 off her 20 balls as the visitors won by 22 runs at Edgbaston, Phoenix closing on 6-152.\n\nPhoenix had opened up on Tuesday (local time) with a trio of Australians, Megan Schutt, skipper Perry and Voll, and Lanning tucked into them with English opening partner Lauren Wingfield-HIll.\n\nAll three bowlers were punished at a rate of more than 10-an-over, not helped by each conceding extras.\n\nPerry used seven bowlers to try to stem the flow, but only spinner Hannah Baker had any effect, dismissing both openers as she took 2-24 in her 20, by far the best economy rate.\n\nLanning was caught at deep midwicket by Lamb for a 19-ball 36, then Wingfield-Hill was taken by Perry at mid-off for 33 off 27.\n\nHowever, Alice Capsey had come in with the platform set and the big-hitting England batter, dropped on 21, thumped 52 off 29 balls.\n\nWhen she was out there were two balls left, Jade-Wellington was caught trying to hit the first for four, Ash Gardner then came in and hit her only ball to the boundary.\n\nPerry finished with 0-34 off 20 balls, Schutt 1-34 off her 20, and Voll's only five-ball set went for 20.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "The Victorian government is being urged to subsidise regional Victorians who must convert their homes and businesses to bottled gas or electricity, after a major retailer's surprise decision to cut compressed gas supply next year.\n\nSolstice Energy announced it would switch off compressed gas networks and stop trucking gas into 10 regional Victorian towns by the end of next year.\n\nMore than 1,100 households at Heathcote, Maldon, Marong, Swan Hill, Kerang, Nathalia, Robinvale, Terang, Lakes Entrance and Orbost will be affected.\n\nJust spent $40,000 on gas\n\nJohn Maynard and his wife Janelle run a cafe and events venue at Nathalia in northern Victoria and last year spent $40,000 installing natural gas during a renovation.\n\nJohn and Janelle Maynard opened Broken Willow restaurant just over a year ago (Supplied: John Maynard)\n\nHe said his business relied on gas for heating, cooking and hot water.\n\nMr Maynard heard about the Solstice gas switch-off after the ABC contacted him last week.\n\n\"If I've got to put electricity in, I've got to then spend probably another $20,000, plus to get my whole wall pulled out and put electricity into my wall, which I don't have at the moment to do,\" he said.\n\nMr Maynard said he also worried that if he switched to bottle gas, it might run out during a large function.\n\n\"We'd be in a lot of trouble,\" he said.\n\nJohn Maynard says he installed a natural gas connection a year ago. (Supplied: John Maynard)\n\nSolstice Energy said it would support every household and business affected by the gas cuts, providing $1,000 up-front payments, gas appliance subsidies, and support to switch to bottled gas.\n\nThose who opt to convert their homes to electricity are advised to apply for Victorian government rebates.\n\nA Victorian government spokesperson said it was providing up to thousands of dollars in discounts for electric appliances through the Solar Homes and Victorian Energy Upgrades programs.\n\nBut Mr Maynard said that was not enough.\n\n\"A lot of small restaurants and businesses around the area are struggling as it is and we need any help we can get,\" he said.\n\nMr Maynard said he was already paying $1,500 to $3,000 a month on gas and he would lose money by closing his business to complete works for the transition.\n\n\"We'd have to be shut down for I reckon two or three weeks just to change everything over,\" he said.\n\nGas switch off 'poorly planned'\n\nThe Victorian government launched the gas substitution road map in 2022 to drive down gas usage across the state.\n\nVictoria Energy Policy Centre head Professor Bruce Mountain said it represented a drastic change in direction, given previous Victorian government policy encouraged households to use gas.\n\nBruce Mountain says households should consider switching from natural gas. (ABC News: Peter Garnish)\n\n\"Households have invested. As a consequence, they have been locked into those choices,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Mountain said he believed Victorians should consider switching away from natural gas, as more suppliers could begin turning off supply.\n\n\"Gas is becoming more scarce, and as consumers use less, the viability of lines becomes even harder to sustain, and so they are progressively cut off,\" he said.\n\nSt Vincent de Paul national energy director Gavin Dufty said the gas cuts in regional Victoria had been poorly planned.\n\nGavin Dufty says it is a \"huge ask\" for home owners to make the costly conversion. (ABC News: Clint Jasper)\n\n\"The lack of coordination between Solstice and the Victorian government to provide long-term, fit-for-purpose solutions for these communities is a glaring, glaring omission,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got these two different options to go to LPG \u2014 back to the future \u2014 or electrify.\n\n\"The big issue here is, they're only giving people a year and a half to make what is quite a huge decision for these households.\n\n\"In the next 20 years, we may see more gas cuts, depending on the size of the communities on the reticulated gas network and government policy.\n\n\"If you're on the gas network at the moment, when your appliance fails and all that, do consider alternatives.\"\n\n'Better off in the long run'\n\nSolstice Energy chief executive Phaedra Deckart said switching from piped gas to bottled gas or electricity would be \"better for customers in the long run\".\n\nPhaedra Deckart says customers will be better off switching to bottled gas or electricity. (Supplied: Solstice Energy)\n\n\"The basis upon which the network was built assumed a much larger demand and a much greater number of customers,\" she said.\n\n\" We have tried everything to make this network viable, however, it is a very high-cost network to truck compressed natural gas to each of these regional towns, and ultimately, costs are going up for customers. \"\n\nSolstice Energy announced a 50 per cent price increase to the 10 impacted towns last Monday.\n\nCustomers had already been hit with an 80 per cent increase in January 2023.\n\nMs Deckart said Solstice would need to continue raising prices every year for its compressed gas service to remain viable.",

        "text": "After three-and-a-half hours in sweltering Ohio heat, Alexei Popyrin just ran out of gas in an epic Cincinnati Open third-round tie with ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n\nPopyrin lost 7\u20136 (7/5), 6\u20137 (5/7), 5\u20137 after a seesaw encounter that could easily have gone the other way.\n\nThe Australian, himself ranked 19, will have the consolation of a very good workout ahead of the US Open, and may appreciate some rest after such a draining encounter. However, his chances of a top 16 ranking and better seeding slot in New York appear to be gone.\n\nWhen Rublev's passing shot beat him to seal victory with the Russian's first match point, Popyrin looked very weary, then smiled ruefully as he dragged himself to the net to give his opponent a hug.\n\nAnother Aussie ousted in round three was Adam Walton.\n\nThe 26-year-old Queenslander was beaten 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/3) by Czech Jiri Lehecka, who is drawn to take on either number five seed Ben Shelton or Roberto Bautista Agut in the last 16.\n\nThe pair had slugged it out for three tight sets, interrupted in the last by a lengthy rain break.\n\nFirst up on Court 3, in front of a decent crowd mainly supporting Rublev, Popyrin's opening serve was broken from 40\u20130 up, but he broke back immediately, helped by a brace of double-faults by the Russian.\n\nThe first set thereafter went with serve to the tiebreak. After four mini-breaks, Popyrin served an ace at 5\u20135 then Rublev, facing set point, double-faulted.\n\nThe second set went with serve to the tiebreak, albeit Popyrin had to save three break points while forcing none. After double-faulting at 4\u20135 in the breaker he broke for 5\u20135, only for Rublev to sweep the next two points and the tiebreak.\n\nThe pair had been playing for more than 2 hours at this stage, in 32-degree heat. There followed an epic 28\u2013point service game in which Popyrin forced but failed to take four break points.\n\nThe match had begun in fierce sunshine shortly after 11:00am, local time, but for some time humidity had been rising and clouds building.\n\nSuddenly, with the third set poised at 2\u20131 to Rublev, and 30\u201330 on Popyrin's serve, a cloudburst flooded the court and sent players and spectators rushing for cover.\n\nPopyrin immediately went a break point down when they resumed just under an hour later, but saved it before serving out with two aces.\n\nThe match then went with serve until, at 30\u201330 and 5\u20136 down, the Australian had to step away from his serve due to a ringing mobile phone. It may have made no difference but his subsequent serves were not quite there and Rublev pounced.\n\nThe Russian now meets Argentina's Francisco Comensana, who beat Reilly Opelka 6\u20137 (4/7), 6\u20134, 7\u20135.\n\nAAP",

Another beautifully observed essay, \u201cThe House at Glenorie\u201d, explores the relationships between lauded architect Glenn Murcutt and artists Sydney Ball and Lynne Eastaway, for whom he designed a house in the middle of the bush at the titular Glenorie, about an hour north-west of Sydney.\n\nThe effect is one of discovery, or rediscovery, of contemporary artists worthy of our attention such as Gill, who represented Australia at the Venice Biennale in 2013 (her artwork is on the book\u2019s cover).\n\nIn a bold editorial (and marketing) move, the book\u2019s 12 essays are not named after the artists they cover (apart from the essay on Indigenous artist the late Mirdidingkingathi Juwarnda Sally Gabori). Instead, the essays are given more cryptic titles, such as \u201cThe World is Made of Layers\u201d (on Vivienne Binns), that relate in some way to the artists\u2019 attitudes or work.\n\nSprague situates himself in the essays as he visits the artists at their homes and studios and reflects on the conversations they have about art (apart from Gabori, whom he met only briefly, and Helen Maudsley, who was not available for interview). He is a searching and solemn writer, but on no occasion cynical. Even when he is not particularly keen on an artist\u2019s work \u2013 and he admits that he doesn\u2019t love Gabori\u2019s \u2013 he seeks to understand it. An art-school graduate and former artist who has worked as a curator and arts co-ordinator, Sprague continues to place art \u201csomewhere close to the centre of my life\u201d, and it\u2019s this that gives his writing an unusual empathy.\n\nCritic Quentin Sprague. Credit: Ross Coulter\n\nAs Sprague explains in the introduction, his love of art was piqued as a child when his single mother would take him and his sister on the 300-kilometre round-trip from their home in Monaro, regional New South Wales, to the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, leaving at dawn in the family\u2019s \u201ctwin-cab Kombi utility\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was visits to the National Gallery of Australia that truly imprinted on my young consciousness,\u201d he writes. He compares the \u201cquiet awe \u2013 enveloping, gentle, deadly serious\u201d of the gallery atmosphere back then to the galleries of today, which can sometimes seem as \u201cmere extensions of some vast industrial entertainment system\u201d.\n\nWhat Artists See is a counter to that \u201cvast industrial entertainment system\u201d; the pace is unhurried, reflective and psychologically probing \u2013 although at least one of the artists, abstract painter Karl Wiebke, seems to grow slightly impatient with Sprague\u2019s insistent need to find the \u201clesson\u201d in his art. Sprague hopes that \u201cWiebke might arrive at an overarching definition of his work\u201d. But Wiebke is not interested in absolutes. If Sprague in this instance is guilty of over-complicating things, he is self-aware enough to recognise it: \u201cIf I was after the \u2018lesson\u2019 of his work, this was surely it: don\u2019t expect a concrete revelation. Or, put another way, don\u2019t expect for the puzzle to be solved.\u201d",

        "text": "Frances Wilson has written about Thomas De Quincey and D.H. Lawrence and the Titanic. Now she has written about Spark with a brilliant recreative justice to the brilliant shot of lightning that illuminates everything Spark did, but also the formal brilliance of the work and the way it remained \u2013 in ways that are at once wacko and regally impressive \u2013 the imprint of a personality that was both magnificent and alarming.\n\nIt\u2019s extraordinary the magnetism of Muriel Spark and the extent to which her work has such an extraordinary power of definition, even when it seems in its ravishing way minor and whole aspects of her life seem eccentric to the point of derangement. But this is the woman to whom the New Yorker devoted an entire issue which contained the text of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , subsequently made into a film starring Dame Maggie Smith and widely regarded as the greatest novella of the mid-20th century.\n\nWilson, who has a captivating analytical mind and an exceptional narrative power that goes along with it, tells the stories of how Spark ran the Poetry Society and the weird chaps (sometimes military gents) she had to fight again and again to gain control. If you\u2019re going to read one work of criticism or critical biography this year read her: she\u2019s some kind of genius.\n\nAnd she does the fullest justice to the maddest stories imaginable. At one point in the 1950s, Spark is not only sleeping with a fellow called Stanford, she\u2019s sharing a journal with him \u2013 one that juxtaposes her cut-glass intensities with his smokey bombast. Then she becomes religious, embracing first Anglo then Roman Catholicism, and she is insistent that if they\u2019re to keep up the sex he had better take on God. He won\u2019t, but Spark (who has written a book about the Book of Job, The Only Question) does with great tolling bells on, while Stanford is possessive about her work.\n\nDame Muriel Spark in 1965.\n\nTogether, they edit Cardinal Newman\u2019s wonderful sermons. Meanwhile, Spark, who is heavily into dexedrine \u2013 and who is at work on a life of Mary Shelley \u2013 gets it into her head that she is receiving secret coded messages from T.S. Eliot (who has just written The Confidential Clerk and was impressed by her review).\n\nSpark\u2019s work goes from strength to strength even where it contains worlds within worlds as well as re-arranging the traditional hierarchies of leading men. There are devils and then there is Spark\u2019s strange double act with Evelyn Waugh\u2019s weird breakdown work The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold, which is full of parallel derangements to her own but which he celebrates with a generous blurb. It\u2019s also the case that Graham Greene, who admired that uncanny panoramic coldness in Spark\u2019s work and her command of the drama of introspection and self-annihilation, kept her alive with monthly cheques.",

        "text": "Paradoxically, such a proposal would not recoup as much money for taxpayers as removing deductions for single property investors, who ultimately cost the government more to subsidise. Loading The Australian Council of Social Services wants to phase out negative gearing entirely and halve the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount over five years. Meanwhile, the Grattan Institute recommends reducing the tax discount to 25 per cent and curbing negative gearing so that rental losses could no longer be offset against wage and salary income. Treasurer Jim Chalmers dismissed any changes to negative gearing or the capital gains tax discount in an interview on ABC News Breakfast on Thursday morning. He said the government was instead focusing on delivering more supply to help housing affordability. About 72 per cent of all investors own one property, ATO data shows, which some experts believe adds to rental insecurity. \u201cPenalising large landlords and exempting small ones is a bad idea,\u201d says Peter Tulip, chief economist at the Centre of Independent Studies.\n\n\u201cAustralia has a terrible problem with rental insecurity \u2013 huge numbers of people will have been evicted because their landlord has decided to sell the property. This is a much smaller problem in Europe or the United States, because their rental stock is owned by big corporations, who are happy for you to stay there for decades. \u201cWe have the wrong landlords, and ACTU wants to make that problem worse.\u201d Treasurer Jim Chalmers has ruled out any changes to negative gearing or the capital gains tax in an interview with the ABC on Thursday. Credit: Oscar Colman Independent economist Saul Eslake says keeping negative gearing benefits to just one property would only affect 29 per cent of investors, meaning \u201cmost people who have a negatively geared property would continue to have it under the ACTU proposal\u201d. Menzies Research Centre\u2019s 2024 research found 18 per cent of negatively geared investors are trade union members, and 65 per cent of negatively geared residential property investors had a taxable income of $120,000 or less. Negative gearing is used by 27,600 nurses and 28,000 teachers.\n\nDavies says while it may be more politically palatable to target large investors, it would make more sense to remove negative gearing altogether. \u201cIf the goal is to make housing more affordable, this won\u2019t make much difference to affordability,\u201d he says. His 2024 paper argues that access to the tax breaks should be conditional on minimum five-year fixed-term leases, one rent increase and inspection per lease period, dwelling quality, and below-market rent. Tulip agrees that tax concessions for investors are unimportant to housing affordability. \u201cSeveral good researchers have estimated their effect on affordability in different ways, and they find their effect is tiny \u2013 between 1 and 4 per cent.\u201d He says there is scope for amendments to the investor taxes.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Ralph Review suggested the capital gains tax discount to promote enterprise and risk taking, and my view is that applies more strongly to investment in shares or other business investment than real estate, where the huge capital gains accrued by landowners aren\u2019t done so for any sacrifice or effort on their part,\u201d he said. Loading Eslake says people should not be allowed to offset excess interest against their wage and salary income, and should instead \u201ccarry it forward as a deduction against the capital gains tax liability when they sell [their property].\u201d He rubbished claims that eliminating negative gearing would make affordability worse. \u201cIf landlords were to sell their investment priorities, who would they sell to? First home buyers or other owner-occupiers trading up,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, it would reduce the supply of rental housing, but it would also reduce the demand for rental housing by the same amount.\u201d Eslake says, despite what they say publicly, politicians and most Australians don\u2019t want the problem of housing affordability to be solved.",

An accomplished horseman who breaks in young stock for Weir at their Ballarat property, charging $2500-$3000 an animal, he attended the William Inglis Yearling Sales in Oaklands with his girlfriend on March 4 this year. While there, he registered his name with the auction house, bid successfully on the 12-month-old Doubtland filly and then used his bank account to settle the $20,050 bill \u2013 $14,000 for the horse and $6050 in fees. Unbeknown to Gordon, he was being watched by Racing Victoria integrity liaison officer Frank De Rango.\n\n\u201cI followed them into the auditorium and was in close proximity as Gordon and Weir stood at the rear of the auditorium, adjacent to the auctioneer\u2019s box,\u201d De Rango said in evidence. \u201cI then witnessed Gordon raise his hand and place a bid on lot 644. The bid was successful, and the relevant horse was knocked down to Gordon.\u201d Taige Weir has ambitions to become a trainer. Credit: Jason South De Rango, who attended the sales in a regulatory role relating to ownership and syndication, then tipped off Racing Victoria stewards. They charged Gordon with breaking AR 116 \u2013 \u201ca jockey is not permitted to own, take a lease or have any interest in a horse\u201d \u2013 which carries a mandatory two-year disqualification. Stewards offered him a three-month ban if he agreed to an early guilty plea.\n\nWeir\u2019s horse When stewards first approached Gordon on March 26, he claimed he was only trying to help his girlfriend. He said she wanted to buy a horse to kickstart her training career, but because she was short of funds it was \u201cagreed we would have a look together, but I would purchase the horse with her\u201d. Paperwork showed the Doubtland filly was not signed over to Weir until March 25 \u2013 three weeks after it was bought at the Inglis sales. Gordon was listed by Inglis as the \u201cpurchaser\u201d. But Gordon insisted the horse was always Weir\u2019s \u201cto pre-train and do whatever she wants with it\u201d.\n\nLoading \u201cMaybe I should have transferred Taige the money, and she could have put her name down,\u201d Gordon told stewards. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d Weir agreed. She said Gordon bid at the auction on her behalf because she \u201cgets nervous\u201d. \u201cHe obviously signed for it because the money was coming out of his bank account because he was helping me out,\u201d she told stewards. \u201cI obviously didn\u2019t know there was a rule involved, and I don\u2019t think Will did, either. Looking back, we wish that I had just done it myself.\u201d\n\nGordon pleaded not guilty to the ownership charge, his legal counsel barrister Damian Sheales told the tribunal, because he was only ever acting as Weir\u2019s agent. Sheales said Gordon always intended \u201cthat he would be repaid or reimbursed by Ms Weir\u201d. Trying to help Racing Victoria\u2019s integrity department wanted Gordon disqualified. \u201cIrrespective of whatever arrangement or understanding he may have had with his partner, the fact is, he on this day purchased this horse and was the owner,\u201d legal counsel Marwan El-Asmar said on behalf of stewards.\n\n\u201cThis idea of a jockey appearing as an agent at an auction and bidding completely undermines the integrity of the industry. And that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve never heard of a jockey bidding at an auction. Never.\u201d But the tribunal found that Gordon was acting as Weir\u2019s agent at all relevant times. Will Gordon rides in this year\u2019s May carnival at Warrnambool. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThat period [of agency] embraces registering for the sale, bidding and purchasing the horse,\u201d VRT chairman Judge John Bowman said. \u201cAs you said when interviewed by the stewards: \u2018I was just trying to help my partner ... when she didn\u2019t have the funds. I don\u2019t see how that damaged anyone or anything\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal dismissed the charge, pursuant to AR 116, against Gordon. Gordon pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of being involved in the buying of thoroughbred bloodstock (AR 118), and while stewards again called for a three-month disqualification, the tribunal settled on a $2500 fine. Fit and proper Whether Gordon ever rides in a race for his partner or for his prospective father-in-law remains to be seen. Taige Weir is yet to apply for a trainer\u2019s licence. Her father cannot reapply until the eve of next year\u2019s spring carnival. But even then, he has hurdles to overcome.",

        "text": "The Australian Council for Trade Unions (ACTU) is joining the call for a four-day work week to become standard across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peak body for trade unions says that reducing working hours is key to boosting productivity while lifting living standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says that alternatives can be offered where a four-day work week is not possible, such as adding more rostered days off, increasing available annual leave, and redesigning rosters. It expects a four-day work week model to maintain the same level of pay through the protection of current pay and conditions.\n\n\n\nACTU president Michele O'Neil said the move would ensure that all Australians would benefit from increased productivity and \"not just those with money and power\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Shorter working hours are good for both workers and employers,\" she said\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement follows the Reserve Bank's economic outlook on Tuesday, which downgraded the productivity outlook from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent, meaning the economy will grow by less than previously anticipated over the next two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACTU wants its productivity solution on the table at Treasurer Jim Chalmers' three-day economic reform summit next week .\n\n\n\nAustralians are working longer hours\n\nSince COVID-19, working hours in Australia have increased. A report from the Productivity Commission found that the record growth in hours did not result in increased output. Instead, productivity slumped overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four-day work week is one proposed solution to this. A 2023 study from Swinburne University examined 10 Australian companies trialling a four-day work week. They found that 70 per cent of the companies reported higher productivity. The 30 per cent that reported no gains found that productivity remained equal to pre-trial levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother peer-reviewed study found that a four-day work week can boost employee satisfaction as well as productivity. A survey of 2,896 employees working four-day weeks in organisations across Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland found shorter working weeks resulted in higher performance, a reduction in burnout, and better employee health and retention.\n\n\n\n'Shaking the tree for ideas'\n\nThe ACTU joins the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, who are also calling for a shorter work week ahead of the productivity roundtable next week.\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says next week's economic reform roundtable aims to \"shake the tree for ideas\" when it comes to boosting productivity. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas But not all workplaces are wanting to move in the same direction. The Australian Financial Review reported that some major banks are shifting their approaches to work culture after Westpac chief executive Anthony Miller sent a memo in December last year outlining his expectation for staff to work \"every day, including Christmas Day\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWestpac is one of the corporate entities contributing to the economic reform roundtable next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers told ABC Radio on Wednesday morning that the roundtable is about \"shaking the tree for ideas\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This economic reform roundtable is not to make decisions, it's to inform the government's decisions,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have an ambitious agenda that we're focused on delivering.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I got the Kyleena coil, like the teeny tiny - and it's so cute - and I was like just put it in me, at this point anything to stop me from being this cray cray girl and they were like okay, we will sort it for you. Went to the clinic and got it done, amazing. You don't even notice that it's there. The insertion was perfect. No pain, I've seen so many people being like 'it's the worst thing don't get it'. It changes your life, it changed my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome for it..\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I wish I knew before getting off hormonal birth control ten years ago. In case you don't know, my name is Evelyn and I'm holistic coach helping conscious women reclaim their bodies and take back control of their hormone health and fertility. So let's get into it, the first thing I wish I knew was that all of the problems that I had prior to going on birth control, like the hormonal acne and really painful periods, were all going to come back, and probably ten times worse than before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n... and some against it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate on birth control rages on TikTok.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm an OBGYN and I'm going to tell you the worst form of birth control. Get ready to take notes, cause you can't miss this. The number one worst form of birth control is, the one that doesn't work for you. So while an IUD may be highly effective - if you don't want it or you don't like it, that's not good for you. Birth control pills work really well if you take them perfectly but if you can't remember how to take a pill every day, that's not going to work for you. The best form of birth control is the one that you want that works for your lifestyle and that you can access.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Dr Jennifer Lincoln from Portland, in the US state of Oregon, speaking in a 2023 TikTok video.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch by La Trobe University analysed 100 TikTok videos on contraceptive health between August and September 2023 with the hashtags #birthcontrol, #contraception, #thepill, #naturalbirthcontrol and #cycletracking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers acknowledge the study is constrained by limitations including a potential for selection bias, the relatively small sample size, and the inclusion of English-language only videos.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven so, during that period those videos had collectively gained nearly five (4.85) billion views and 14.6 million likes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, published in the journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, only 10 per cent of the videos sampled were created by medical professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers found more than half - 53 per cent - of TikTok content creators clearly rejected hormonal birth control, while about a third - 34 per cent - expressed distrust in health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan Bugden is the La Trobe report's co-author and a lecturer in public health.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says a lot of the advice given on Tik Tok is based on personal experience and beliefs rather than medical advice or evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So there's a real opportunity for public health practitioners to join these platforms and disseminate accurate, reliable, non-judgemental content that's easily accessible to a huge range of individuals. We need to be partnering with trusted online voices that have this huge reach with young people and ensure that they're getting access to non-biased information that is informing their contraceptive beliefs and therefore then decision making.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe adds while videos by health professionals gained on average more likes and followers, TikTok\u2019s algorithms amplify influencers\u2019 voices, giving them greater reach than it gives medical experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Budgen says most of the influencers they analysed were explicitly endorsing natural birth control methods, methods known as 'fertility awareness'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A good example of why these videos are unreliable or what makes them ineffective on their own can be seen in some of the trends that we saw around a growing desire for a hormonal-free form of contraception.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says the videos failed to disclose any potential limitations, which can include motivation, partner cooperation and biological variabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe La Trobe lecturer in public health says what's worrying is that it will mislead a large proportion of young people by over-emphasising the reliability of the method - failing to discuss the potential risks of unplanned pregnancy or STIs.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says social media is reshaping health care providers\u2019 relationships with patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important that young people understand that a lot of the information online can be misleading or incomplete or biased. And so I would always encourage individuals to think about where the information's coming from. Always ask what could be informing that person's opinion. Has the uploader included any additional resources where you can go and find extra information or any evidence that supports the claims that they're making.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study notes TikTok offers an excellent public health opportunity to disseminate accurate contraceptive information accessible to all individuals, regardless of their background or resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Budgen says with TikTok\u2019s widespread reach, women\u2019s and public health organisations also have a significant role to play in countering misinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she urges people to seek credible contraceptive advice - that just because someone says they're a doctor or wears a lab coat, it doesn't mean they can be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Always ask your medical practitioner as well. Go in and have a discussion around some of the ideas you've seen online and ask how credible they are and how reliable they are, and ask them for evidence. You can always ask your GP for the clinical guidelines relating to any sort of medical recommendation that they're suggesting.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Members of Victoria's parliament are being urged to support proposed changes to a law that prevents some people with disability from speaking freely and publicly about their experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are set to introduce a bill to parliament today, alongside disability advocate Uli Cartwright, seeking to amend the 'gag law' \u2014 known as clause 37 \u2014 affecting those under guardianship or administration orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCartwright has long advocated for reform of this law based on his lived experience of such orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just outdated. It needs to be changed,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, guardianship laws vary state to state but gag laws, which restrict public comment on such arrangements, are enforced across most jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Nicole was seeking justice. She says her disability was used to discredit her in court\n\nFor many Australians currently or formerly subject to guardianship, including Cartwright, this limits their ability to speak openly about their experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move by the Greens seeks to change that in Victoria. The proposed amendment adds to calls of support from disability sector organisations, along with the Victorian Office of the Public Advocate \u2014 the state body responsible for advocating for the rights of people living with disability \u2014 which backed amending the legislation in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not only are we listening to advocates in the sector, but the Office of Public Advocate has also made their position pretty clear on this exact reform,\" Greens MP Anasina Gray-Barberio said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to be ensuring that legislation as it stands does not constrain the rights of people with a disability.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is clause 37?\n\nIn Australia, a person may be placed under guardianship or administration orders if they require help with decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn appointed guardian then has legal authority to make decisions or support decision-making on behalf of an individual about personal and lifestyle matters specified in an order. An administrator is someone granted authority over financial and property matters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, the so-called gag law refers to clause 37 in schedule 1 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) Act 1998, which states that, \"unless the Tribunal orders otherwise\", a person must not publish or broadcast information that could identify parties involved in guardianship and administration proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tribunal may make an order, \"only if it considers it would be in the public interest to do so\".\n\n\n\nThe Greens' proposed amendment is set to be introduced to parliament in Victoria on Wednesday. Source: AAP / Con Chronis This provision can effectively stop people from talking publicly about any of their experiences of guardianship or administration orders. This can also extend to VCAT proceedings, according to a spotlight paper published by the Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) in February.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Victorian MPs, the state's peak advocacy organisation for adults with intellectual disability, VALID, said the \"unnecessary restriction\" is applied automatically and \"assumes the need to protect people with disabilities\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Their will and preference is not taken into account,\" the letter reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It contradicts human rights principles, undermines transparency and public trust and curtails free speech.\"\n\n\n\nSBS News is investigating experiences of guardianship in Australia. Have you got a story to share?\n\nGet in touch at investigations@sbs.com.au or securely contact Emma Brancatisano at emmabrancatisano.journalist@protonmail.com .\n\nGray-Barberio said the current legislation has a \"silencing impact\" on those under guardianship or administration orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is so important for them to be able to have choice and control when it comes to their decision-making, to publicly share their lived experience and stories related to their guardianship. I think that is within public interest,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People living with disability or with chronic health [conditions] shouldn't have to ask for permission to tell their own story and lived experience.\"\n\n\n\nTelling Uli Cartwright's story\n\nCartwright, 30, is an advocate who lives with disability. He came up against the gag law several years ago when a documentary about his life became subject to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife is a Battlefield was acquired by SBS and broadcast in December 2021 as part of the International Day of People with Disability, after which it was available online via SBS' streaming service On Demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after it screened, VCAT raised concerns relating to Cartwright having identified himself as someone previously under the control of the State Trustees. SBS decided to take the program down to allow legal concerns to be addressed.\n\n\n\nUli Cartwright has been a long-standing advocate for reform. Credit: Otis Filley Cartwright applied to VCAT for a declaration that clause 37 did not apply in his case, with a tribunal deputy president making an order allowing the material to be published. This meant the documentary could go back online, and Cartwright could be legally identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nCartwright has been advocating for reform in Victoria ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost states and territories in Australia, except the ACT, ban the publication of information about guardianship proceedings in some way, according to the VLRC paper. This varies state by state, with Tasmania introducing changes last September.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the recommendations from the Disability Royal Commission was that states and territories should amend their laws to \"repeal provisions prohibiting publication of material identifying a party to the proceedings as the default position\".\n\n\n\nThe Victorian private member's bill, backed by Cartwright, proposes an amendment to clause 37 of the Act, which allows a represented person, or someone authorised by them, to disclose information about their proceedings without requiring tribunal approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there is a place for it [the gag provision],\" Cartwright said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do believe that there needs to be some protections in place to stop abuse and weaponisation of people's stories, whether that's with the media or with family members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the bill says the silence mechanism is not the default. It's an extra step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens' Gray-Barberio said the change would ensure a \"human rights approach\" to legislation in the state.\n\n\n\n'Simply the right thing to do'\n\nIn a letter to Victoria's parliament on 6 August, VALID's chief executive Fionn Skiotis called on all members to support the upcoming bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Provisions to protect privacy and limit the disclosure of sensitive and personal information, for example by parties other than the person subject to an order, will continue to exist,\" Skiotis said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our view, supporting this change is simply the right thing to do, for any elected representative in Victoria, so that all citizens in the state can enjoy the same freedoms and rights, whether they are a person with disability or not.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Advocates 'devastated, disappointed' with government's disability royal commission response SBS News 04:07 English\n\nIt follows disability service providers Yooralla and Life Without Barriers supporting gag law reform in Victoria in late 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Freedom for people with disability to speak with the media and share their experiences under guardianship is an important step in transparency and accountability and can contribute to safeguarding by individuals and organisations responsible for providing safe and quality support,\" Life Without Barriers said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nYooralla said current legislation is at odds with decision principles in the Guardianship and Administration Act 2019, which state that a person\u2019s will and preference should only be overridden to prevent serious harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While safety and privacy are a factor, the Act conflicts with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disability, which provides the rights of people with disability to freedom of expression and opinion and the participation in political and public life,\" its statement said.\n\n\n\nIn April 2023, the Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) also voiced support for reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OPA recognised there are \"valid reasons\" to limit the disclosure of sensitive and personal information discussed in guardianship and administration proceedings to protect the privacy of those under orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it said these should ensure the person's right to tell their own story is not inadvertently limited.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt called on the government to amend the legislation, saying: \"Ensuring people can freely tell their own stories will increase transparency and promote public trust in this essential safeguarding system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGray-Barberio said there has been \"no progress\" in reform since 2023.\n\n\n\nThis is one small section which we feel is really important, that we feel the government should recognise.\n\n\"The evidence is there, the calls are there from the community, from advocates, campaigners, as well as the Office of the Public Advocate. So really, it makes sense for them [the government] to come on board and support this reform,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian government has been contacted for comment.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Reserve Bank's interest rate cut will be felt as good news for millions of mortgage holders across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA announced a reduction in the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points from 3.85 per cent to 3.6 per cent. It marks the third rate cut this year, following similar reductions in February and May.\n\n\n\n\n\nRBA governor Michele Bullock acknowledged the cut comes as \"households are still feeling the pain of higher costs\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The board will keep doing what it needs to do to keep inflation down and maintain a healthy jobs market because when inflation is low and stable and people can get jobs; it's good for households, it's good for the community, and it's good for the broader Australian economy.\"\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said the decision was \"welcome relief\" for borrowers and would \"put more money in the pockets of people who are under pressure\" .\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how much will mortgage holders save?\n\n\n\nHousehold savings on the way\n\nAccording to financial comparison website Canstar, mortgage holders with a $500,000 loan can expect to save around $74 per month. This estimate is based on an owner-occupier paying principal and interest with 25 years remaining on the mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose with higher mortgages, up to $1 million, can expect to save around $148 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding the two previous rate cuts in February and May, the accumulated savings are even higher. Those with a $500,000 loan could potentially save $226 per month, while those with a $1 million loan could save up to $453 per month.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News\n\nWill the banks pass the savings on?\n\nA number of banks have promised to pass the rate cut in full to customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Westpac customers, a -0.25 per cent rate adjustment will be passed on for variable interest rate home loans from 26 August.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank says its cuts will come into effect on 22 August. Macquarie Bank announced its variable rates will be reduced as of 15 August.\n\n\n\n\n\nANZ and NAB have followed suit. Around 20 lenders also cut their variable rate ahead of the RBA's announcement.\n\n\n\nA number of major banks have promised to pass on the rate cut in full to customers. Source: AAP / Rick Rycroft Diana Mousina, deputy chief economist at AMP, urges caution as not all mortgage holders will be eligible for an automatic reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's not this automatic reduction to mortgage rates just because of what the RBA does. It may take a few months for it to actually get passed through to mortgage repayments.\"\n\n\n\nPaying more now to save later\n\nCanstar data insights director Sally Tindall suggests that some mortgage holders may benefit from keeping their repayments the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For those managing to hold their budgets together, consider keeping your repayments exactly the same,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every rate cut is another opportunity to invest back into your mortgage and potentially be debt-free months, if not years early.\"\n\n\n\nIf a mortgage holder who was sitting on a $600,000 loan in February kept their repayments steady, they would be paying $272 more per month in repayments than if they had lowered them to the minimum rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it would also mean shaving off three years and three months from the length of their mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, Tindall urges mortgage holders to weigh up what is best for them.\n\n\n\nA good time to talk to the bank\n\nMousina says, despite the cut announcement, mortgage holders are still paying more than they were a few years ago .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, any sort of rate cut can still be seen as relief, but given that rates were hiked so much it's just taking some of that increased pressure away. Mortgage holders are still paying more than they were a few years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMousina says that it's important to figure out if your current mortgage is appropriate for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You want to make sure your variable rate is the lowest you can have.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall says that after this rate cut, ambitious owner-occupiers should be able to set themselves a stretch target of 5.25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your mortgage rate is one number where you want to be aiming for well below average.\"\n\n\n\n",

That gives you a sense that here in Australia, we've been able to get inflation down, we're seeing interest rates come down three times in six months, and at the same time as we have maintained historically low unemployment as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leader of the Opposition says the Prime Minister is out of his depth in deciding that Australia will recognise a Palestinian state.\n\n\n\n\n\nSussan Ley has told 2GB Radio that the Coalition's position is recognition should come at the end of a peace process with Israel - and that doing it while Hamas is still fighting in Gaza makes it harder to achieve a two-state solution, and damages our relationships with allies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It dismisses that relationship in an appalling way, our friends, our allies. And most importantly it is disrespectful of the relationship with the U-S. Because any peace that happens in this region will be brokered by the U.S. And the prospects of a ceasefire are not good with this decision. The prospects take a step backwards.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Foreign Minister Penny Wong says the Australian government has made a considered decision that now is the best time for Australia to contribute to the momentum for a two-state solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has told Sky News that recognition could also be used to isolate Hamas, who the Minister says should have no role in governing Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Success is not guaranteed, but success never comes from just doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different outcome. And that's the judgement countries of the world, including Australia, are making.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nA date for the by-election in the New South Wales seat of Kiama has been announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nState Parliament speaker Greg Piper has confirmed the election will be held on September 13.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous MP Gareth Ward resigned on Friday as the parliament was preparing to vote to expel him after his conviction for sexual and indecent assault offences.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTropical reefs off the coast of Western Australia have suffered the worst coral bleaching ever recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the latest data collected by scientists, conditions have worsened across parts of the 1,500 kilometres of tropical reefs offshore.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas including Ningaloo and north Kimberley, which have been rarely affected before, have recorded heavy losses on the back of record sea surface temperatures around Australia last summer which were the warmest on record.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr James Gilmour, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says the heat stress was more intense and widespread than previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we've seen is temperatures have increased by a degree or up to four, and that has remained for several months, so it is really that cumulative heat stress that have caused corals to bleach, and in some instances, to cook and die.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington DC officials have moved to reassure residents after the deployment of 800 National Guardsmen to the city, on the orders of US President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration has also temporarily taken over the city's police department in an extraordinary assertion of presidential power in the nation's capital.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president says his actions are necessary to save the city from what he has described as a wave of lawlessness.\n\n\n\n\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser says there is no justification for what Trump has done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't believe or believe it's legal to use the American military against American citizens on American soil. I'm not a lawyer. And so but I think that's a fairly widely held fact. And so but we've seen them move, I think, the active military into California.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe military government in Mali has started to return home the historic manuscripts of Timbuktu, which were spirited out of their fabled northern city when it was occupied by al-Qaida-linked militants more than a decade ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the documents dating back to the 13th century were saved by the devotion of the Timbuktu library's Malian custodians, who carried them out of the occupied city in rice sacks, on donkey carts, by motorcycle, by boat and four-wheel drive vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport and in netball news,\n\n\n\n\n\nDonnell Wallam is returning to Australia to play for the Sunshine Coast Lightning in the Super Netball League next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has spent the last year in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "All of Australia's 'big four' banks have vowed to pass on the 0.25 percentage point rate cut handed down by the Reserve Bank of Australia, after it announced a reduction in the cash rate from 3.85 to 3.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank and Westpac were the first of the big four to announce they would pass the cut on in full to customers, with ANZ and NAB following. Macquarie also announced it would pass on the cut in full.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said the widely anticipated decision was \"welcome relief\" for borrowers and would \"put more money in the pockets of people who are under pressure\".\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers said Australians could thank themselves for lowering inflation but acknowledged that a cut to the official cash rate \"won't solve every problem we have in our economy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt marks the third interest rate cut of the year, following similar reductions in February and May.\n\n\n\nTuesday's announcement marks the third interest rate cut this year. Source: SBS News In July, the RBA board surprised the market by voting 6-3 to hold rates steady as it waited for the Australian Bureau of Statistics' June quarter inflation figures .\n\n\n\n\n\nThose figures, released in late July, showed annual inflation easing from 2.4 to 2.1 per cent . June labour figures also showed unemployment had risen to 4.2 per cent, another precondition for reducing interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Bui, an economist at financial services firm AMP, told SBS On the Money podcast the announcement is \"pretty much no surprise\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the RBA economic outlook, also released today, points to more rate cuts in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA still sees the unemployment rate peaking slightly higher from now as well as inflation sustainably landing in the midpoint of the target, so for me that's a sign of more rate cuts to come,\" she said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, some economists have criticised the central bank's decision to wait until August to announce the cut.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiana Mousina, deputy chief economist at AMP, said: \"I think it's the rate cut we didn't get in July.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think the Reserve Bank should have waited and caused disappointment, and also caused confusion in the markets.\"\n\n\n\nThreat of trade war easing\n\nIn a press conference announcing the decision, RBA governor Michele Bullock rejected questions about whether the board's rate-setting was restrictive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The board will keep doing what it needs to do to keep inflation down and maintain a healthy jobs market because when inflation is low and stable and people can get jobs, it's good for households, it's good for the community and it's good for the broader Australian economy,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA also pointed to global uncertainty caused by United States President Donald Trump's tariffs on the global economy .\n\n\n\nRBA governor Michele Bullock says global economic uncertainty remains even though the immediate threat of a trade war is easing. Source: AAP / Yuri Gripas \"The global outlook remains unpredictable even though it seems that the risk of a more damaging, widespread trade war has eased a bit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Bullock said the central bank still expected both global and domestic growth to slow over the rest of the year and into 2026 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't have a point estimate for where we might end up. You'll note in the forecasts we have inflation coming back down to target and the unemployment remaining where it is, with a couple more cash rate cuts in there. That's the best sort of guess. But things can change.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board reiterated its commitment to maintaining full employment and price stability, though acknowledged that weak demand from consumers could lead to job losses.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Others include the uncompromising Mike Parr, known for his confronting performance art, in a fascinating essay about Parr\u2019s collaboration and eventual falling-out with master printer John Loane. Another beautifully observed essay, \u201cThe House at Glenorie\u201d, explores the relationships between lauded architect Glenn Murcutt and artists Sydney Ball and Lynne Eastaway, for whom he designed a house in the middle of the bush at the titular Glenorie, about an hour north-west of Sydney.\n\nThe effect is one of discovery, or rediscovery, of contemporary artists worthy of our attention such as Gill, who represented Australia at the Venice Biennale in 2013 (her artwork is on the book\u2019s cover).\n\nIn a bold editorial (and marketing) move, the book\u2019s 12 essays are not named after the artists they cover (apart from the essay on Indigenous artist the late Mirdidingkingathi Juwarnda Sally Gabori). Instead, the essays are given more cryptic titles, such as \u201cThe World is Made of Layers\u201d (on Vivienne Binns), that relate in some way to the artists\u2019 attitudes or work.\n\nSprague situates himself in the essays as he visits the artists at their homes and studios and reflects on the conversations they have about art (apart from Gabori, whom he met only briefly, and Helen Maudsley, who was not available for interview). He is a searching and solemn writer, but on no occasion cynical. Even when he is not particularly keen on an artist\u2019s work \u2013 and he admits that he doesn\u2019t love Gabori\u2019s \u2013 he seeks to understand it. An art-school graduate and former artist who has worked as a curator and arts co-ordinator, Sprague continues to place art \u201csomewhere close to the centre of my life\u201d, and it\u2019s this that gives his writing an unusual empathy.\n\nCritic Quentin Sprague. Credit: Ross Coulter\n\nAs Sprague explains in the introduction, his love of art was piqued as a child when his single mother would take him and his sister on the 300-kilometre round-trip from their home in Monaro, regional New South Wales, to the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, leaving at dawn in the family\u2019s \u201ctwin-cab Kombi utility\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was visits to the National Gallery of Australia that truly imprinted on my young consciousness,\u201d he writes. He compares the \u201cquiet awe \u2013 enveloping, gentle, deadly serious\u201d of the gallery atmosphere back then to the galleries of today, which can sometimes seem as \u201cmere extensions of some vast industrial entertainment system\u201d.\n\nWhat Artists See is a counter to that \u201cvast industrial entertainment system\u201d; the pace is unhurried, reflective and psychologically probing \u2013 although at least one of the artists, abstract painter Karl Wiebke, seems to grow slightly impatient with Sprague\u2019s insistent need to find the \u201clesson\u201d in his art. Sprague hopes that \u201cWiebke might arrive at an overarching definition of his work\u201d. But Wiebke is not interested in absolutes. If Sprague in this instance is guilty of over-complicating things, he is self-aware enough to recognise it: \u201cIf I was after the \u2018lesson\u2019 of his work, this was surely it: don\u2019t expect a concrete revelation. Or, put another way, don\u2019t expect for the puzzle to be solved.\u201d",

        "text": "Frances Wilson has written about Thomas De Quincey and D.H. Lawrence and the Titanic. Now she has written about Spark with a brilliant recreative justice to the brilliant shot of lightning that illuminates everything Spark did, but also the formal brilliance of the work and the way it remained \u2013 in ways that are at once wacko and regally impressive \u2013 the imprint of a personality that was both magnificent and alarming.\n\nIt\u2019s extraordinary the magnetism of Muriel Spark and the extent to which her work has such an extraordinary power of definition, even when it seems in its ravishing way minor and whole aspects of her life seem eccentric to the point of derangement. But this is the woman to whom the New Yorker devoted an entire issue which contained the text of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , subsequently made into a film starring Dame Maggie Smith and widely regarded as the greatest novella of the mid-20th century.\n\nWilson, who has a captivating analytical mind and an exceptional narrative power that goes along with it, tells the stories of how Spark ran the Poetry Society and the weird chaps (sometimes military gents) she had to fight again and again to gain control. If you\u2019re going to read one work of criticism or critical biography this year read her: she\u2019s some kind of genius.\n\nAnd she does the fullest justice to the maddest stories imaginable. At one point in the 1950s, Spark is not only sleeping with a fellow called Stanford, she\u2019s sharing a journal with him \u2013 one that juxtaposes her cut-glass intensities with his smokey bombast. Then she becomes religious, embracing first Anglo then Roman Catholicism, and she is insistent that if they\u2019re to keep up the sex he had better take on God. He won\u2019t, but Spark (who has written a book about the Book of Job, The Only Question) does with great tolling bells on, while Stanford is possessive about her work.\n\nDame Muriel Spark in 1965.\n\nTogether, they edit Cardinal Newman\u2019s wonderful sermons. Meanwhile, Spark, who is heavily into dexedrine \u2013 and who is at work on a life of Mary Shelley \u2013 gets it into her head that she is receiving secret coded messages from T.S. Eliot (who has just written The Confidential Clerk and was impressed by her review).\n\nSpark\u2019s work goes from strength to strength even where it contains worlds within worlds as well as re-arranging the traditional hierarchies of leading men. There are devils and then there is Spark\u2019s strange double act with Evelyn Waugh\u2019s weird breakdown work The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold, which is full of parallel derangements to her own but which he celebrates with a generous blurb. It\u2019s also the case that Graham Greene, who admired that uncanny panoramic coldness in Spark\u2019s work and her command of the drama of introspection and self-annihilation, kept her alive with monthly cheques.",

        "text": "Paradoxically, such a proposal would not recoup as much money for taxpayers as removing deductions for single property investors, who ultimately cost the government more to subsidise. Loading The Australian Council of Social Services wants to phase out negative gearing entirely and halve the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount over five years. Meanwhile, the Grattan Institute recommends reducing the tax discount to 25 per cent and curbing negative gearing so that rental losses could no longer be offset against wage and salary income. Treasurer Jim Chalmers dismissed any changes to negative gearing or the capital gains tax discount in an interview on ABC News Breakfast on Thursday morning. He said the government was instead focusing on delivering more supply to help housing affordability. About 72 per cent of all investors own one property, ATO data shows, which some experts believe adds to rental insecurity. \u201cPenalising large landlords and exempting small ones is a bad idea,\u201d says Peter Tulip, chief economist at the Centre of Independent Studies.\n\n\u201cAustralia has a terrible problem with rental insecurity \u2013 huge numbers of people will have been evicted because their landlord has decided to sell the property. This is a much smaller problem in Europe or the United States, because their rental stock is owned by big corporations, who are happy for you to stay there for decades. \u201cWe have the wrong landlords, and ACTU wants to make that problem worse.\u201d Treasurer Jim Chalmers has ruled out any changes to negative gearing or the capital gains tax in an interview with the ABC on Thursday. Credit: Oscar Colman Independent economist Saul Eslake says keeping negative gearing benefits to just one property would only affect 29 per cent of investors, meaning \u201cmost people who have a negatively geared property would continue to have it under the ACTU proposal\u201d. Menzies Research Centre\u2019s 2024 research found 18 per cent of negatively geared investors are trade union members, and 65 per cent of negatively geared residential property investors had a taxable income of $120,000 or less. Negative gearing is used by 27,600 nurses and 28,000 teachers.\n\nDavies says while it may be more politically palatable to target large investors, it would make more sense to remove negative gearing altogether. \u201cIf the goal is to make housing more affordable, this won\u2019t make much difference to affordability,\u201d he says. His 2024 paper argues that access to the tax breaks should be conditional on minimum five-year fixed-term leases, one rent increase and inspection per lease period, dwelling quality, and below-market rent. Tulip agrees that tax concessions for investors are unimportant to housing affordability. \u201cSeveral good researchers have estimated their effect on affordability in different ways, and they find their effect is tiny \u2013 between 1 and 4 per cent.\u201d He says there is scope for amendments to the investor taxes.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Ralph Review suggested the capital gains tax discount to promote enterprise and risk taking, and my view is that applies more strongly to investment in shares or other business investment than real estate, where the huge capital gains accrued by landowners aren\u2019t done so for any sacrifice or effort on their part,\u201d he said. Loading Eslake says people should not be allowed to offset excess interest against their wage and salary income, and should instead \u201ccarry it forward as a deduction against the capital gains tax liability when they sell [their property].\u201d He rubbished claims that eliminating negative gearing would make affordability worse. \u201cIf landlords were to sell their investment priorities, who would they sell to? First home buyers or other owner-occupiers trading up,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, it would reduce the supply of rental housing, but it would also reduce the demand for rental housing by the same amount.\u201d Eslake says, despite what they say publicly, politicians and most Australians don\u2019t want the problem of housing affordability to be solved.",

        "text": "US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war was meant to rebalance global power in the United States\u2019 favour. Instead, China is playing the long game, enduring short-term economic pain to shape any eventual deal to its advantage.\n\nThe strategy appears to be working \u2014 for now. On Monday, Washington granted Beijing another 90-day reprieve, extending a pause on tariffs through November 10. China announced it would do the same. Markets welcomed the move, which offered some relief after months of tension. The delay will give Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s policymakers more time to plan their next move.\n\nTime is on Xi Jinping\u2019s side. Credit: AP\n\nTime is Xi\u2019s ally. So far, the clearest outcome of each round of talks has been a commitment to meet again. Despite Trump\u2019s insistence that China has taken significant steps to improve their trade relationship, Beijing has made no consequential concessions on any of his key concerns. (China has offered some small compromises, none on the scale of American demands.)\n\nThe extension has come at a delicate time for China\u2019s economy, which is plagued by sluggish domestic demand and a slowdown in the property sector. Bloomberg Economics says that it is among the few major nations without a clear timeline or terms for a deal, while others have struck agreements to secure lower tariffs. Even with this reprieve, it notes, Beijing faces average US tariffs of 40 per cent \u2014 almost 25 percentage points above the global average.",

        "text": "$20,050 bill Gordon was living and working with Taige Weir, assisting his partner with her fledgling pre-training business, when he took his willingness to help a step too far. An accomplished horseman who breaks in young stock for Weir at their Ballarat property, charging $2500-$3000 an animal, he attended the William Inglis Yearling Sales in Oaklands with his girlfriend on March 4 this year. While there, he registered his name with the auction house, bid successfully on the 12-month-old Doubtland filly and then used his bank account to settle the $20,050 bill \u2013 $14,000 for the horse and $6050 in fees. Unbeknown to Gordon, he was being watched by Racing Victoria integrity liaison officer Frank De Rango.\n\n\u201cI followed them into the auditorium and was in close proximity as Gordon and Weir stood at the rear of the auditorium, adjacent to the auctioneer\u2019s box,\u201d De Rango said in evidence. \u201cI then witnessed Gordon raise his hand and place a bid on lot 644. The bid was successful, and the relevant horse was knocked down to Gordon.\u201d Taige Weir has ambitions to become a trainer. Credit: Jason South De Rango, who attended the sales in a regulatory role relating to ownership and syndication, then tipped off Racing Victoria stewards. They charged Gordon with breaking AR 116 \u2013 \u201ca jockey is not permitted to own, take a lease or have any interest in a horse\u201d \u2013 which carries a mandatory two-year disqualification. Stewards offered him a three-month ban if he agreed to an early guilty plea.\n\nWeir\u2019s horse When stewards first approached Gordon on March 26, he claimed he was only trying to help his girlfriend. He said she wanted to buy a horse to kickstart her training career, but because she was short of funds it was \u201cagreed we would have a look together, but I would purchase the horse with her\u201d. Paperwork showed the Doubtland filly was not signed over to Weir until March 25 \u2013 three weeks after it was bought at the Inglis sales. Gordon was listed by Inglis as the \u201cpurchaser\u201d. But Gordon insisted the horse was always Weir\u2019s \u201cto pre-train and do whatever she wants with it\u201d.\n\nLoading \u201cMaybe I should have transferred Taige the money, and she could have put her name down,\u201d Gordon told stewards. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d Weir agreed. She said Gordon bid at the auction on her behalf because she \u201cgets nervous\u201d. \u201cHe obviously signed for it because the money was coming out of his bank account because he was helping me out,\u201d she told stewards. \u201cI obviously didn\u2019t know there was a rule involved, and I don\u2019t think Will did, either. Looking back, we wish that I had just done it myself.\u201d\n\nGordon pleaded not guilty to the ownership charge, his legal counsel barrister Damian Sheales told the tribunal, because he was only ever acting as Weir\u2019s agent. Sheales said Gordon always intended \u201cthat he would be repaid or reimbursed by Ms Weir\u201d. Trying to help Racing Victoria\u2019s integrity department wanted Gordon disqualified. \u201cIrrespective of whatever arrangement or understanding he may have had with his partner, the fact is, he on this day purchased this horse and was the owner,\u201d legal counsel Marwan El-Asmar said on behalf of stewards.\n\n\u201cThis idea of a jockey appearing as an agent at an auction and bidding completely undermines the integrity of the industry. And that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve never heard of a jockey bidding at an auction. Never.\u201d But the tribunal found that Gordon was acting as Weir\u2019s agent at all relevant times. Will Gordon rides in this year\u2019s May carnival at Warrnambool. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThat period [of agency] embraces registering for the sale, bidding and purchasing the horse,\u201d VRT chairman Judge John Bowman said. \u201cAs you said when interviewed by the stewards: \u2018I was just trying to help my partner ... when she didn\u2019t have the funds. I don\u2019t see how that damaged anyone or anything\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal dismissed the charge, pursuant to AR 116, against Gordon. Gordon pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of being involved in the buying of thoroughbred bloodstock (AR 118), and while stewards again called for a three-month disqualification, the tribunal settled on a $2500 fine. Fit and proper Whether Gordon ever rides in a race for his partner or for his prospective father-in-law remains to be seen. Taige Weir is yet to apply for a trainer\u2019s licence. Her father cannot reapply until the eve of next year\u2019s spring carnival. But even then, he has hurdles to overcome.",

        "text": "Motorists could soon be charged to travel through a popular Queensland beach town as locals demand something be done.\n\nMotorists could soon be charged to drive through one of Australia's busiest beach towns after its surge in popularity in recent years has left roads congested and parking options scarce, with the local council hoping the proposed fees will act as a deterrent to tourists.\n\nQueensland's Noosa Heads has long been a popular holiday destination, and during peak times roads such as Hastings Street on the beachfront can quite literally come to a standstill. These traffic jams have irked locals, who have pushed the council for a solution, and Noosa Shire Council has been consulting on plans to introduce a charge for those travelling in congestion-prone hotspots.\n\nIt is unclear how much the congestion fee would be or how it would be collected. However, there are suggestions that toll booths would be installed along the road where drivers would have to stop and pay, or drivers could pay via a tag in their car, most likely on weekends and school holidays to begin with.\n\nMore paid parking would also be introduced in busy areas, with lower costs for residents, and more transport infrastructure would be introduced to deter tourists from driving their cars along busy roads.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Destination Management Plan (DMP) claimed the town is \"being loved to death\" and the council acknowledged that it has to step in to mitigate the issues caused by tourists, while also accommodating them.\n\nAuthorities are now urging the public to provide feedback on the DMP, and have until September to do so. If given the green like, it will be the first congestion road charge of its kind in Australia. It's proved a successful idea in cities overseas such as New York which introduced congestion pricing on certain roads in January this year.\n\nVehicle recognition technology could be introduced to help\n\nThe council has proposed introducing vehicle recognition technology on its roads to help determine whether cars are owned by locals or are simply travelling through. This would be used to ensure residents aren't copping the brunt of the proposed changes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProfessor Matthew Burke from Griffith University previously told Yahoo News that congestion charges for tourists is \"not a new idea\" as several towns in the UK and Europe have them. When asked if he thinks it would be appropriate for Noosa, Professor Burke said that \"it's not illogical\".\n\n\"[It would] free up that strip and discourage people from heading in and causing congestion to everyone else,\" he said.\n\nIllegal camping continues to put pressure on beach town\n\nWhile many coastal regions across the country have been grappling with illegal camping, Noosa in particular has been overrun with travellers sleeping overnight in car parks.\n\nThe issue has become so significant that the council announced $333 fines will be issued to anyone caught illegally camping along the Peregian Esplanade or at Victory Park along Lorikeet Drive. The rules were introduced on July 24, with 50 fines handed out during two weeks in the area.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
