Nothing more that I could do,\" Vine said after covering the course in 13 minutes and 1.79 seconds at a staggering average of 56.179 kilometres per hour.\n\nA fraction quicker, he could even have been celebrating his third win of what has been a fantastic Vuelta for the 29-year-old Queenslander, who is set to win the King of the Mountains classification with just three stages left.\n\nVuelta time trial cut by half over safety reasons Photo shows Riders line up next to Palestinian protesters Organisers shortened the individual time trial over safety concerns as pro-Palestinian protesters have lined stages of this year's race.\n\nIt was not such a good day for fourth-placed Australian Jai Hindley, as he lost three more precious seconds to Briton Tom Pidcock in their battle for the last step on the podium.\n\nBritain's Olympic mountain bike champion Pidcock, who is enjoying a huge breakthrough Grand Tour, finished 22nd on the day, one place ahead of Hindley, to push his lead over the West Australian to 39 seconds.\n\nRealistically, there is only one big mountain test for Hindley to try to leapfrog Pidcock in the standings, a mountainous 20th stage that finishes atop the Bola del Mundo.\n\nThat should be the stage where Vine wraps up his King of the Mountains triumph in the blue polka dot jersey worn by the race's top climber, but he still has a big job to do to assist UAE Team Emirates-XRG leader Joao Almeida, who is only 40 seconds behind leader Jonas Vingegaard in the overall standings.\n\nAlmeida trimmed Vingegaard's lead by 10 seconds with a fine ride for third place in the time trial, seven seconds behind Vine.\n\nWhat made Vine's effort so impressive on Friday was that it came off the back of so many major efforts in the mountains over the past two-and-a-half weeks, but ultimately the 2023 Australian time trial champ just could not quite match Ganna's remarkable late burst.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I was looking down at the watts and not being able to go any faster,\" Vine said.\n\n\"I looked at the TV before I was setting off and he was doing 67 [kph] at one point. I don't think I even got close to that number. So yes, he was smooth.\"\n\nOne of the early starters, double world time trial champ Ganna, reckoned he struggled to find his rhythm early on a course that had been shortened by more than half from its originally scheduled 27.2km because of the threats of more possible pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nBut he was six seconds faster than Vine over the final 4 kilometres, and then had to wait for three hours to learn if his time would be bettered.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "In a manner of speaking, there are still moments when Jamal Fogarty doesn't feel like the best halfback in Canberra.\n\nIt's not that Fogarty is low on confidence ahead of Sunday's qualifying final against Brisbane.\n\nAfter his best season in first grade, where he's steered the Raiders to the minor premiership and has the big prize in his sights, self-belief has never been higher.\n\nIt's just that even now, at 58 and a quarter century after he retired, sometimes Ricky Stuart's still got it.\n\n\"Even at training now, he'll tell me 'grab the ball and kick it like this' and he'll do it perfect first go and I'll be out there doing 10 reps and I still can't get it right,\" Fogarty said.\n\n\"Sometimes he might tip me up if I don't do something well, but he's not trying to coach me to be like him.\n\n\"I've always respected that with Stick. I don't have the natural ability he did.\n\n\"He understands he's a bit more talented than I am. He knows my strengths and what I do well and he encourages those things.\"\n\nIn his playing days, Ricky Stuart was one of Canberra's very best. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nIt's just as well because the Raiders don't need their halfback to be Ricky Stuart, they just need him to be Jamal Fogarty and so far that's proven to be plenty.\n\nAfter not becoming a regular NRL player until he was 26 after spending more than half a decade in the Queensland Cup and only playing his 100th first grade game this year, eight seasons after his debut, Fogarty is having the kind of season that was worth the wait.\n\nHe's equal second among halfbacks for try assists and has the most assists of any finals halfback after becoming the fulcrum around which Canberra's attack turns.\n\nThe Raiders, who have never been afraid of being too weird to live and too rare to die, have always relied more than most on the unorthodox to score their points, which is why Fogarty says he's not surprised to see what break-out players like Ethan Strange and Kaeo Weekes have done this season.\n\n\"We saw bits of it last year, this year we're just seeing it more,\" Fogarty said.\n\nCanberra revel in their Strange new world Photo shows Ethan Strange of the Raiders celebrates scoring a try during the round 23 NRL match between Canberra Raiders and Manly Sea Eagles at GIO Stadium, on August 08, 2025, in Canberra, Australia. At 21 and on the back of a breakout season, Ethan Strange has the ball on a string, Canberra's finals fate in his hands and the rugby league world at his feet.\n\n\"When you're fit and healthy those moments are going to show up more often and in previous years we definitely weren't as fit as we are now.\"\n\nThe other major change has been Fogarty himself.\n\nHe's playing with a greater control, both of his team and his own game, than ever before but never with a heavy touch.\n\nFogarty gives Canberra just enough structure to back up the instinctive play without ever sanding down the jagged edges that make them hard to handle.\n\nThe balance they've found \u2014 which has helped them score the third-most points in the league \u2014 is a product of evolution rather than invention. It cannot be taught, only learned.\n\nCanberra might be the only place it could work and the Raiders might be the only team who could do it that way and even if Fogarty is not the perfect halfback he is the perfect halfback for this style, which is exactly why it's all come together the way it has.\n\nThe 31-year old is quick to heap praise elsewhere, especially on attacking coach Justin Giteau.\n\nFogarty is aiming to end his time with Canberra on the ultimate high. (Getty Images: Mark Nolan)\n\n\"He's always asking me how I want to play, which plays are going to be good for me and what style to play,\" Fogarty said.\n\n\"Having a coach give us that confidence and thinks so similar makes it easy for me to buy in.\n\n\"But the team has bought into that process as well, the coaches have put things in place that have made it easy for us to get our structure on and let the guys inside and outside me play their style within that structure.\"\n\nFor that system to work, every Raider has to be able to bring some manner of individual brilliance to the table and for Fogarty it's his kicking game.\n\nHe dominates that department for Canberra. It's not unusual for Strange, his halves partner, to only have one or two kicks a week and before he was rested for the final round of the regular season, Fogarty had more kicks, kick metres and attacking kicks than any other player in the competition.\n\nHis specialty is the knuckle-ball floating bombs that cut through the air at nightmare angles.\n\nCanterbury's Matt Burton can send them higher but Fogarty has a greater control, which means he utilises them far more regularly.\n\nWhen he hits them right they cannot be caught by friends or foes alike and a bouncing ball creates the kind of chaos on which Canberra thrives.\n\nFogarty's kicking game is his deadliest weapon. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)\n\n\"Ricky backs me and encourages me to practice them at training, not just at the end of training but in scrimmage as well,\" Fogarty said.\n\n\"Even if I shank it he goes 'don't worry about it, just get the next one', so it's good to not have that over your head.\n\n\"If you hit a sweet one at training and the outside backs drop it, I have a bit of a giggle and get into them, but that gives me confidence if we're in the right field position I can throw them up.\n\n\"I've been lucky to hit a couple of nice ones this year, but it's all from practice.\"\n\nRegardless of what happens against Brisbane or in the weeks to come, Fogarty's time as the ringmaster of Canberra's psycho circus is coming to an end.\n\nHe's off to Manly next year on a four-year deal that, given his later start in first grade, was impossible to refuse.\n\nBut there is much to be done before then, first against Brisbane and then with whatever lies beyond and this time of year pressure weighs heavy on any halfback.\n\nA lack of finals experience is often tipped as Canberra's weakness but this is Fogarty's fourth play-off campaign.\n\nHe knows what to expect and given he's been a leader for some time now \u2014 when he was at Gold Coast, he captained the first grade side in just his 16th NRL game \u2014 he knows how to transfer that knowledge to the Green Machine's prodigies.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe advice is simple and Fogarty follows it himself \u2014 back yourself and believe in yourself, no matter what, even if it took years for your first NRL game, even if your coach can do things you can't do, because all you need to be out there is you.\n\n\"I tell all the kids who come into grade for their first game, or when they come into the team, to just enjoy it, be yourself and have fun,\" Fogarty said.\n\n\"When you do those things, you're willing to do all the one-percenters better more often than that.\n\n\"When Jarrod [Croker] was still playing there were times when it'd be 18-all and he'd say 'alright, let's just have some fun out there, back ourselves and see how we go' and I'd be like 'that's pretty cool, that's Jarrod Croker saying that' and it put things in perspective.\n\n\"Don't worry about the pressure, just have fun with your footy, like you did when you were a kid. That's what it comes down to for me.\"",

(ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nBut for Mrs Mutch, it's about more than styling hair. She says the stories and community the far west has to offer keep her coming back.\n\n\"These women work so hard in the outback,\" she said.\n\n\" I love to be able to spoil them a little bit and just spend time with them and I just admire them. I think they're amazing. \"\n\n'My day to look after me'\n\nThe makeover magic all happens in an op shop on Wilcannia's main street.\n\n\"I've come every six weeks to do a normal hairdressing service and also I'm contracted for Catholic Care. So that might be 'providing' pamper days or it could be job ready or like working with the school with some of the students,\" she said.\n\nIt's local schoolteacher Karen O'Donnell's day off and she's in the chair getting her hair done.\n\nAunty O'Donnell's days at the local central school are hectic and she finds being pampered a welcome break from a busy schedule.\n\nSince Aunty O'Donnell, a Barkindji elder, returned to Wilcannia about five years ago, she has been making appointments with the travelling hairdresser.\n\n\"I work four days a week, so Julie knows that my fifth day is my day off to look after me,\" she said.\n\n\"So she did offer for me to come in and have a little package and [I'm] loving the experience.\"\n\nBarkindji elder Karen O'Donnell settles in for a chat, a laugh and Juliann Mutch's hair care. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nAunty O'Donnell believes Mrs Mutch's history in the area makes it easier for her to connect with locals.\n\n\"You just can't get anyone to do her job that she does,\" she said.\n\n\"She does travel to other smaller towns like Bourke [but] she really relates well with my family here \u2014 Barkindji mob and also non-Barkindji.\"\n\nKaren O'Donnell enjoys extra treats from Juliann Mutch. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nIt was also an opportunity for locals to access a service that \"bigger towns\" had, Ms O'Donnell said.\n\n\"Wilcannia is a wonderful place to live. It's been bagged out for a long time and look, it's just a lovely place and there are some beautiful people in town,\" she said.\n\n'Our hero'\n\nThe salon chair also doubles as a safe space where nothing is off the table.\n\nNatalie Batson, a mother of three who works on a station near Wilcannia, travels 40km to see Mrs Mutch.\n\nShe said, like Aunty O'Donnell, her life was busy.\n\nThey spend the appointment talking about beauty tips and life, the good parts and the bad.\n\nNatalie Batson travels 40km for the laughs, talk and styling tips when Juliann Mutch is in town. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\n\"Today I had my hair washed, which for station wives, that's a big thing,\" Ms Batson said.\n\n\"[I] have my hair washed, blow dried, straightened and styled and Juliann's always up for helping me with little styling tips to make my life easier, which is invaluable.\n\n\" It's so good for our mental health \u2026 we have the best laughs here and there's no topic that's off limits. We can talk about our sad days as well as our good days. \"\n\nShe said the service was invaluable to the community.\n\n\"She's one of our heroes, our travelling hairdresser, and it's a big ask for Juliann to be travelling these distances on the roads that sometimes get presented to her,\" Mrs Baton said.\n\nJuliann Mutch straightens Natalie Batson's hair \u2014 all part of the service she offers to make her clients \"feel special\". (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\n\"I already have to travel 40km just to get into town \u2026 If we didn't have this service [it] would be Broken Hill and for me that's 250km one way.\"\n\nGiving back\n\nMrs Mutch, who took up hairdressing 40 years ago after work experience in high school, likes the idea of giving back to her community via a service that is not often available.\n\nShe has been cutting hair and offering a safe space for a chat since starting with a salon in Broken Hill when she was 22.\n\nAfter having children and moving to Mildura, she felt a need to return to the region.\n\n\"I like to make people feel special,\" she said.\n\n\"I think you can change someone's day with a bit of kindness and looking sensational.\n\n\"If I've made someone else's day, that makes my day.\n\nIt's a five-hour trip to Wilcannia every six weeks for Juliann Mutch and something she looks forward to.

        "text": "His wife Maria is Peruvian, they have two grown-up sons, and he has said that at home they speak three languages. \u201cWe are kind of a United Nations at home,\u201d he said last year. He\u2019s an ocean swimmer, a keen reader of history, and he and his wife are looking for a home in Melbourne (and living in the Park Hyatt while they search for a place, The Australian Financial Review reported). Matos has said that ambition is one of his most important leadership beliefs,. About a decade ago, he started aspiring to run an international organisation, or a big domestic bank in an important market. He got a chance to realise this ambition when ANZ\u2019s board, chaired by Paul O\u2019Sullivan, picked the banker as ANZ\u2019s next chief executive late last year, soon after he had resigned from one of the biggest banks in the world, HSBC. Matos had risen to run HSBC\u2019s personal and wealth arm, and was reportedly seen as a contender to run HSBC, but missed out on the top job and left the London-headquartered giant in August 2024. He is paid $2.5 million a year to run ANZ, with the potential to make more than $8 million including bonuses, depending on whether he hits performance targets.\n\nWhile ANZ is one of the biggest companies in Australia with 43,000 globally, at HSBC Matos was responsible for a business with twice as many employees. He also led the HSBC response to a massive money laundering scandal in Mexico \u2013 a high-stakes clean-up task that lasted years. Although he had not experienced Australia\u2019s banking market firsthand before taking the job, he said this week he had observed it from Asia. One market participant who has met Matos says he appears keen to listen \u2013 in contrast to some offshore chief executives who have appeared to think they know what is best when they turned up in Australia. They say that in person, Matos comes across as low-key, serious and analytical. \u201cHe\u2019s very different to other CEOs who have come from abroad to Australia. He was really interested in what people have to say,\u201d they said. Loading While we don\u2019t know all his plans for ANZ yet \u2013 key details are expected at a strategy day next month \u2013 Matos has flagged some key principles. Some of his top priorities are to get the bank moving faster and to make its culture more performance-driven. He has suggested ANZ staff keep presentations to no more than five pages, and staff were also told meetings should have a clear purpose and agenda. The bank has also recently reminded staff they needed to turn up to the office at least 50 per cent of the time to get a bonus. Like many other corporate bosses, he believes spending some time in the office is important for career development, as well as mental health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to observe and to evolve if you are on Zooms and Teams \u2026 that face-to-face conversation is much more effective,\u201d he said last month, according to The West Australian. Even before this week\u2019s deep job cuts were announced, some ANZ staff had criticised or ridiculed Matos\u2019 approach, with some hitting the chat platform Reddit to vent. Giving him nicknames such as \u201cPapi\u201d and \u201cEl Nuno\u201d, some of these staff members anonymously made fun of the boss, while railing against the changes he is bringing. ANZ shares have lagged the bigger three rivals. Credit: Natalie Boog The Finance Sector Union has also been highly critical of the speed at which Matos is moving. The union said the pace of change pushed through by him caused last month\u2019s infamous email chaos \u2013 staff found out they were being sacked through an automated email telling them to return their laptop. Banking analysts and investors are generally more supportive of Matos\u2019 changes, though some say his plans are not without risk.\n\nThey believe change is needed mainly because ANZ is underperforming. Its shares have lagged the bigger three rivals and several bank-watchers think there is room to reduce costs. MST Marquee analyst Brian Johnson believes there is \u201ca degree of over-staffing\u201d in the bank, but he had thought cuts would involve about 2000 jobs, rather than the 3500 target Matos announced. Johnson says there is \u201cexecution risk\u201d that comes with cutting as deeply as this, but overall, he says the status quo at ANZ was not acceptable to shareholders. Loading \u201cI actually think he\u2019s a change agent. I think that he is genuinely motivated about fixing it up,\u201d Johnson says of Matos. There has been widespread speculation among analysts that with the job cuts announced this week, an October strategy will include details about more financial targets for the bank. Matos has also indicated that a big priority will be to deal with the expensive digital platform ANZ Plus, which has underwhelmed the market. Some think he could pull back on the ambitious tech project.\n\nImproving how the bank deals with non-financial risk is also high on Matos\u2019 to-do list. The bank is still awaiting the results of a regulatory investigation into potential \u201cconduct issues\u201d in its markets business, and is holding $1 billion in extra capital due to the banking regulator\u2019s long-standing concerns about weaknesses in ANZ\u2019s risk management. Investors say there are plenty of areas where ANZ needs work, and some said this week that Matos could cut the bank\u2019s dividend as part of a \u201cclearing of the decks\u201d. Importantly, Matos said this week that ANZ also had many strengths \u2013 such as being the most international of the Australian banks and having a flagship institutional bank \u2013 but he added that \u201cwe need to do some things better\u201d.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size After 25 years, Ian Thorpe has lost count of how many strangers swear they were inside the Sydney International Aquatic Centre on the night of September 16, 2000. It was the night Thorpe, a 17-year-old with size-17 feet, touched the wall first in the 400-metre freestyle final to claim Australia\u2019s first gold medal of the Sydney Olympics. Just over an hour later, Thorpe dived back in to anchor the men\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay, chasing down American superstar Gary Hall jnr to deliver a historic victory \u2014 capped by the famous air-guitar celebration that instantly entered folklore. When stopped on the street, Thorpe\u2019s response is always the same. \u201cI was there too!\u201d Australia\u2019s Ian Thorpe shows off his gold medal following the men\u2019s 400-metre freestyle swimming event at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Credit: Sygma via Getty Images The stories rarely stop there. Thorpe has heard them all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were the fans who refused to board their flight so they wouldn\u2019t miss his race. An excited woman once told Thorpe she gave birth while cheering him on. \u201cI was like, \u2018why were you watching?\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. We are sitting in a quiet corner of the same arena which once served as Thorpe\u2019s coliseum a quarter of a century ago, where millions around the world watched his brilliance. Next week marks 25 years since the Sydney 2000 Olympics. After a quick photoshoot beside his favourite lane four block, Thorpe, now 42, affords himself a moment to take it all in. Only a handful of public swimmers are using the pool, which allows Thorpe a rare hour away from the glare of being one of the world\u2019s most recognisable athletes. A world champion at 15, Thorpe lost all anonymity with his three gold and two silver medals in Sydney. Ian Thorpe dives in at the Sydney Olympics. Credit: Dallas Kilponen\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis pool is very familiar to me,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it was a generation ago, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it was yesterday either. It feels like just over a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I ever get to sit here and ponder my thoughts.\u201d Now he is, and the memories rush back \u2014 though some are hazy after the whirlwind of those 16 glorious days in 2000. What Thorpe never revealed publicly is that, for a fleeting moment, he considered walking away from swimming altogether after Sydney. It is a stunning admission. As Thorpe carried the Australian flag at the closing ceremony, with fireworks flashing above the Olympic stadium after performances from Kylie Minogue, Midnight Oil and INXS, Thorpe imagined a life away from the pool, free from the suffocating pressure. \u201cI actually thought, \u2018okay, that\u2019s enough for me. I\u2019ve done everything I set out to do\u2019,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cMy goal when I was young was to be an Olympian and my dream was to be an Olympic champion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Klim, Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett enjoying the closing ceremony. Credit: 2000 \u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018I want to be an astronaut\u2019. To be an Olympic champion is like going into space. Not many get to do it. I had accomplished that and considered for a very brief moment [walking away]. The closing ceremony was over and it was actually when the fighter jets were flying over the stadium. \u201cI then had a break, which I was having anyway, and in a great way, my world expanded. It was the inspiration that I got outside the pool that got me back in.\u201d The pressure to perform in Sydney was immense, especially in the 400m freestyle, where Thorpe was the overwhelming favourite. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cIt was assumed I would just win \u2026 but I\u2019m 17 and there\u2019s a human behind all of this. Yeah, I can do extraordinary things, but I\u2019m as awkward and uncomfortable as any 17-year-old in the world. I broke my leg less than a year out from the Olympics. People don\u2019t remember that. I was also accused of doping by the German head coach. It wasn\u2019t smooth sailing. I had doubts in myself until I heard the crowd roar, which gave me a brief second out of my head. That was what I needed to flick into race mode. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this until really recently, but they put the 400m freestyle and the men\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay on the same night so the Sydney Olympics would go off with a bang. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d Australian teammates (from left) Ashley Callus, Chris Fydler, Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe celebrate after winning gold and setting a new world record in the men\u2019s 4X100m freestyle relay event at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

The USA had never been beaten in the event. A swimsuit malfunction almost cost Thorpe his place on the blocks, but his nerves eased when Australia\u2019s lead-off man, Michael Klim, blitzed the first two laps. \u201cYou broke the world record,\u201d Thorpe told Klim. \u201cBut what was my time?\u201d Klim asked. \u201cI can\u2019t remember. Faster than anyone in history.\u201d Thorpe adds: \u201cI must have looked at Michael like, \u2018do not ask me again\u2019. He was banging my block. I looked up at him and said \u2018f\u2014k off, that is not going to help me\u2019. It was distracting but I was ready to race.\u201d After diving in almost level, Hall quickly surged ahead, silencing the Sydney crowd. But in the final 15 metres, \u2018Thorpedo\u2019 had other ideas.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Share\n\nNew wine bar and grocer The Corner is set to take over The Boathouse Palm Beach in late September, joining a spring wave of waterside pivots, reboots and launches across Sydney\u2019s hospitality sector. From Palm Beach in the north to Kyle Bay in Sydney\u2019s south, the city is stockpiling new waterside restaurant stock for summer. In November, British celebrity chef Rick Stein is expected to launch a 220-seat restaurant and bar overlooking Coogee Beach, while the team from northern beaches favourite Pilu at Freshwater plans to open Flaminia at Circular Quay. Head chef Sam Kane at upcoming venue The Corner, Palm Beach. Trent van der Jagt The Corner will bring a new concept to the peninsula, says head chef Sam Kane: \u201cI call it a grocery store with a wine bar.\u201d The Boathouse Group partnered with Kane to rebrand the parkside venue occupied by The Boathouse Palm Beach, which is now slated to close on Sunday, September 14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt used to be a homewares store [with] a cafe, but didn\u2019t have any [great] point of difference,\u201d Kane says. \u201c[Now], day-trippers will be able to pop in for supplies, some produce, a sandwich or some sunscreen.\u201d The Corner will be led by seasonal produce. Trent van der Jagt Kane worked at high-profile venues such as Bistro Moncur in Woollahra before relocating north for a five-year stint as head chef at Merivale restaurant Bert\u2019s Bar & Brasserie in Newport. When he left Bert\u2019s to spend more time with his young family, the chef decided to stay on the northern beaches. Inspired by the chef\u2019s relationships with food producers, The Corner plans to sell hard-to-find ingredients Kane himself would like to buy, while offering a strong eat-in program. As well as the daytime eat-in offering, on Friday and Saturday nights Kane will put his kitchen apron back on to pump out an $85 fixed-price dinner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be some similarities to the way I built dishes at Bert\u2019s, [including] elements of the crudo,\u201d Kane says. \u201cBut [the menu] mostly [consists of] new stuff built around the produce and [seafood] out of the Hawkesbury.\u201d Etheus opened at the former home of Promenade Bondi Beach. Steven Woodburn Going Greek One of the emerging trends on the Sydney waterfront is the number of restaurants pivoting to Greek food. Bondi Pavilion restaurant Promenade Bondi Beach recently joined the party, relaunching as Etheus in August. Now, diners plough through plates of spanakorizo or king prawn saganaki as they watch the waves roll in to Bondi Beach. It\u2019s a similar story at Woolloomooloo, where seafood restaurant Manta was reborn as the Greek-leaning restaurant Akti in June, and at Kyle Bay, where Jaaks Restaurant and Bar reopened on Friday, September 12 with a new concept and design revamp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJaaks head chef Arman Uz, who drew on his Turkish heritage during his previous role as executive chef for the hospitality group behind Sydney restaurants such as Maydonoz and Baharat, hopes the waterside restaurant can bring Greek island vibes to Sydney\u2019s southern suburbs. The new Jaaks dining room at Kyle Bay. Jaaks is ditching its upmarket, fine-dining pitch, and re-booting as a mezedopolio (tapas bar). \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d Uz says. \u201cTo me, degustation is a bit boring. Special occasion places, people need to plan [ahead]. [But, within our new format], you can [choose to] come for a couple of dishes, or a set menu.\u201d Greek food isn\u2019t new turf for Uz, who worked at Jaaks when he arrived in Sydney in 2017. He\u2019ll give the dishes his own twist: lakerda (preserved fish) with green tomato and papara, and salmon belly substituted for pork in a retooled version of Cyprus sausages known as sheftalies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFood doesn\u2019t have borders, Turkey and Greece share [many] common dishes,\u201d he says.

Got it Share\n\nThe only thing more unusual than the location of new eatery Sega is the pizza it serves. Inside a functioning laundromat on Elgin Street in Carlton, the team behind nearby Italian restaurant Al Dente Enoteca are putting their own spin on a style of stuffed pizza found across Italy. The pizza shop is housed inside a functioning laundromat in a glass-walled space that was about to be demolished. Chris Hopkins Chef and co-owner Andrea Vignali wasn\u2019t on the hunt for another venue. But the idea came to him when he was at Soap Spot Laundrette doing washing for the restaurant and noticed a defunct glass-walled cafe space which was once briefly home to coffee shop Two Snakes. \u201cI went back to have another look and saw it about to be demolished ... to put in vending machines,\u201d says Vignali. \u201cThe next thing you know I\u2019ve signed a lease on WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018No one really does it like this [in Melbourne].\u2019 Chef Andrea Vignali Structurally, little has changed. Sega has just freshened up the existing cafe space at the front of the laundromat, adding some new seating and splashes of pastel-green paint, which also colour the small but sunny courtyard beyond the washing machines. 1 / 8 Owner-chef Andrea Vignali preparing Sega\u2019s prosciutto di carpegna pizza.

Sega deals in what the team has dubbed pizza chiusa (\u201cclosed\u201d in Italian), inspired by the stuffed pizza farcita found across Italy. Instead of topping the pizza, the good stuff goes inside, creating something like a circular sandwich. At Sega, they cut each pizza base like a bread roll, load it with your fillings of choice and toast it until golden and gooey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article \u2018If you see hi-vis, keep going\u2019: Melbourne\u2019s most hidden restaurants and takeaway spots Vignali has collaborated with South Melbourne\u2019s Focacceria Pugliese on a custom pizza dough that\u2019s par-cooked in a wood-fired oven. It\u2019s delivered daily, ready to be filled before it finishes cooking in the sandwich press. \u201cWhen you eat it from the toaster, it has that wood-fired pizza taste,\u201d says Vignali. \u201cNo one really does it like this [in Melbourne].\u201d More classic options include ham and cheese, spicy salami with fior di latte and Vignali\u2019s own chilli paste, and a four-cheese combo of provolone, mozzarella, stracciatella and brie. Others are more cheffy, like one with rare roast beef from Al Dente and horseradish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s $22 for a full pizza, $15 for half, and $15 for toasties made with sourdough instead. The offering also includes drinks, such as matcha lattes and St Ali coffee, as well as a green-tinged hybrid tiramisu that combines both products for maximum caffeination. Plus, Sega is the only place you can get Tarts Anon sweets outside the latter\u2019s own locations, so you might find the pastry cabinet lined with anything from pecan slices to tiny rhubarb tarts.

        "text": "Treasury yields eased in the bond market following the release of economic reports, which were some of the final data releases left that could sway the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking before its meeting next week. The unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will cut its main interest rate for the first time this year.\n\nOne of Thursday\u2019s reports said more US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the number of layoffs could be rising. It\u2019s the latest discouraging signal on the job market, where hiring has slowed substantially. The labour market had seemed to be settling into a low-hire, low-fire state, but an increase in layoffs could put it in an even tighter vise.\n\nThe hope on Wall Street has been for a slowdown, but only for a precisely measured one. The job market has to be worrying enough to get the Fed to cut interest rates, which can give a kickstart to the economy and to prices for investments, but not so weak that it causes a recession.\n\nThe Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates throughout 2025 because of the threat that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could make inflation worse. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher.\n\nA report on inflation on Thursday showed prices are continuing to rise faster for US households than the Fed hopes, but only by the amount that economists expected. Consumers paid prices for food, petrol and other costs of living that were 2.9 per cent higher in August than a year earlier, a slight acceleration from July\u2019s 2.7 per cent inflation rate.",

        "text": "His wife Maria is Peruvian, they have two grown-up sons, and he has said that at home they speak three languages. \u201cWe are kind of a United Nations at home,\u201d he said last year. He\u2019s an ocean swimmer, a keen reader of history, and he and his wife are looking for a home in Melbourne (and living in the Park Hyatt while they search for a place, The Australian Financial Review reported). Matos has said that ambition is one of his most important leadership beliefs,. About a decade ago, he started aspiring to run an international organisation, or a big domestic bank in an important market. He got a chance to realise this ambition when ANZ\u2019s board, chaired by Paul O\u2019Sullivan, picked the banker as ANZ\u2019s next chief executive late last year, soon after he had resigned from one of the biggest banks in the world, HSBC. Matos had risen to run HSBC\u2019s personal and wealth arm, and was reportedly seen as a contender to run HSBC, but missed out on the top job and left the London-headquartered giant in August 2024. He is paid $2.5 million a year to run ANZ, with the potential to make more than $8 million including bonuses, depending on whether he hits performance targets.\n\nWhile ANZ is one of the biggest companies in Australia with 43,000 globally, at HSBC Matos was responsible for a business with twice as many employees. He also led the HSBC response to a massive money laundering scandal in Mexico \u2013 a high-stakes clean-up task that lasted years. Although he had not experienced Australia\u2019s banking market firsthand before taking the job, he said this week he had observed it from Asia. One market participant who has met Matos says he appears keen to listen \u2013 in contrast to some offshore chief executives who have appeared to think they know what is best when they turned up in Australia. They say that in person, Matos comes across as low-key, serious and analytical. \u201cHe\u2019s very different to other CEOs who have come from abroad to Australia. He was really interested in what people have to say,\u201d they said. Loading While we don\u2019t know all his plans for ANZ yet \u2013 key details are expected at a strategy day next month \u2013 Matos has flagged some key principles. Some of his top priorities are to get the bank moving faster and to make its culture more performance-driven. He has suggested ANZ staff keep presentations to no more than five pages, and staff were also told meetings should have a clear purpose and agenda. The bank has also recently reminded staff they needed to turn up to the office at least 50 per cent of the time to get a bonus. Like many other corporate bosses, he believes spending some time in the office is important for career development, as well as mental health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to observe and to evolve if you are on Zooms and Teams \u2026 that face-to-face conversation is much more effective,\u201d he said last month, according to The West Australian. Even before this week\u2019s deep job cuts were announced, some ANZ staff had criticised or ridiculed Matos\u2019 approach, with some hitting the chat platform Reddit to vent. Giving him nicknames such as \u201cPapi\u201d and \u201cEl Nuno\u201d, some of these staff members anonymously made fun of the boss, while railing against the changes he is bringing. ANZ shares have lagged the bigger three rivals. Credit: Natalie Boog The Finance Sector Union has also been highly critical of the speed at which Matos is moving. The union said the pace of change pushed through by him caused last month\u2019s infamous email chaos \u2013 staff found out they were being sacked through an automated email telling them to return their laptop. Banking analysts and investors are generally more supportive of Matos\u2019 changes, though some say his plans are not without risk.\n\nThey believe change is needed mainly because ANZ is underperforming. Its shares have lagged the bigger three rivals and several bank-watchers think there is room to reduce costs. MST Marquee analyst Brian Johnson believes there is \u201ca degree of over-staffing\u201d in the bank, but he had thought cuts would involve about 2000 jobs, rather than the 3500 target Matos announced. Johnson says there is \u201cexecution risk\u201d that comes with cutting as deeply as this, but overall, he says the status quo at ANZ was not acceptable to shareholders. Loading \u201cI actually think he\u2019s a change agent. I think that he is genuinely motivated about fixing it up,\u201d Johnson says of Matos. There has been widespread speculation among analysts that with the job cuts announced this week, an October strategy will include details about more financial targets for the bank. Matos has also indicated that a big priority will be to deal with the expensive digital platform ANZ Plus, which has underwhelmed the market. Some think he could pull back on the ambitious tech project.\n\nImproving how the bank deals with non-financial risk is also high on Matos\u2019 to-do list. The bank is still awaiting the results of a regulatory investigation into potential \u201cconduct issues\u201d in its markets business, and is holding $1 billion in extra capital due to the banking regulator\u2019s long-standing concerns about weaknesses in ANZ\u2019s risk management. Investors say there are plenty of areas where ANZ needs work, and some said this week that Matos could cut the bank\u2019s dividend as part of a \u201cclearing of the decks\u201d. Importantly, Matos said this week that ANZ also had many strengths \u2013 such as being the most international of the Australian banks and having a flagship institutional bank \u2013 but he added that \u201cwe need to do some things better\u201d.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size After 25 years, Ian Thorpe has lost count of how many strangers swear they were inside the Sydney International Aquatic Centre on the night of September 16, 2000. It was the night Thorpe, a 17-year-old with size-17 feet, touched the wall first in the 400-metre freestyle final to claim Australia\u2019s first gold medal of the Sydney Olympics. Just over an hour later, Thorpe dived back in to anchor the men\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay, chasing down American superstar Gary Hall jnr to deliver a historic victory \u2014 capped by the famous air-guitar celebration that instantly entered folklore. When stopped on the street, Thorpe\u2019s response is always the same. \u201cI was there too!\u201d Australia\u2019s Ian Thorpe shows off his gold medal following the men\u2019s 400-metre freestyle swimming event at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Credit: Sygma via Getty Images The stories rarely stop there. Thorpe has heard them all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were the fans who refused to board their flight so they wouldn\u2019t miss his race. An excited woman once told Thorpe she gave birth while cheering him on. \u201cI was like, \u2018why were you watching?\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. We are sitting in a quiet corner of the same arena which once served as Thorpe\u2019s coliseum a quarter of a century ago, where millions around the world watched his brilliance. Next week marks 25 years since the Sydney 2000 Olympics. After a quick photoshoot beside his favourite lane four block, Thorpe, now 42, affords himself a moment to take it all in. Only a handful of public swimmers are using the pool, which allows Thorpe a rare hour away from the glare of being one of the world\u2019s most recognisable athletes. A world champion at 15, Thorpe lost all anonymity with his three gold and two silver medals in Sydney. Ian Thorpe dives in at the Sydney Olympics. Credit: Dallas Kilponen\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis pool is very familiar to me,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it was a generation ago, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it was yesterday either. It feels like just over a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I ever get to sit here and ponder my thoughts.\u201d Now he is, and the memories rush back \u2014 though some are hazy after the whirlwind of those 16 glorious days in 2000. What Thorpe never revealed publicly is that, for a fleeting moment, he considered walking away from swimming altogether after Sydney. It is a stunning admission. As Thorpe carried the Australian flag at the closing ceremony, with fireworks flashing above the Olympic stadium after performances from Kylie Minogue, Midnight Oil and INXS, Thorpe imagined a life away from the pool, free from the suffocating pressure. \u201cI actually thought, \u2018okay, that\u2019s enough for me. I\u2019ve done everything I set out to do\u2019,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cMy goal when I was young was to be an Olympian and my dream was to be an Olympic champion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Klim, Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett enjoying the closing ceremony. Credit: 2000 \u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018I want to be an astronaut\u2019. To be an Olympic champion is like going into space. Not many get to do it. I had accomplished that and considered for a very brief moment [walking away]. The closing ceremony was over and it was actually when the fighter jets were flying over the stadium. \u201cI then had a break, which I was having anyway, and in a great way, my world expanded. It was the inspiration that I got outside the pool that got me back in.\u201d The pressure to perform in Sydney was immense, especially in the 400m freestyle, where Thorpe was the overwhelming favourite. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cIt was assumed I would just win \u2026 but I\u2019m 17 and there\u2019s a human behind all of this. Yeah, I can do extraordinary things, but I\u2019m as awkward and uncomfortable as any 17-year-old in the world. I broke my leg less than a year out from the Olympics. People don\u2019t remember that. I was also accused of doping by the German head coach. It wasn\u2019t smooth sailing. I had doubts in myself until I heard the crowd roar, which gave me a brief second out of my head. That was what I needed to flick into race mode. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this until really recently, but they put the 400m freestyle and the men\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay on the same night so the Sydney Olympics would go off with a bang. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d Australian teammates (from left) Ashley Callus, Chris Fydler, Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe celebrate after winning gold and setting a new world record in the men\u2019s 4X100m freestyle relay event at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

The USA had never been beaten in the event. A swimsuit malfunction almost cost Thorpe his place on the blocks, but his nerves eased when Australia\u2019s lead-off man, Michael Klim, blitzed the first two laps. \u201cYou broke the world record,\u201d Thorpe told Klim. \u201cBut what was my time?\u201d Klim asked. \u201cI can\u2019t remember. Faster than anyone in history.\u201d Thorpe adds: \u201cI must have looked at Michael like, \u2018do not ask me again\u2019. He was banging my block. I looked up at him and said \u2018f\u2014k off, that is not going to help me\u2019. It was distracting but I was ready to race.\u201d After diving in almost level, Hall quickly surged ahead, silencing the Sydney crowd. But in the final 15 metres, \u2018Thorpedo\u2019 had other ideas.\n\nAdvertisement",

From Palm Beach in the north to Kyle Bay in Sydney\u2019s south, the city is stockpiling new waterside restaurant stock for summer. In November, British celebrity chef Rick Stein is expected to launch a 220-seat restaurant and bar overlooking Coogee Beach, while the team from northern beaches favourite Pilu at Freshwater plans to open Flaminia at Circular Quay. Head chef Sam Kane at upcoming venue The Corner, Palm Beach. Trent van der Jagt The Corner will bring a new concept to the peninsula, says head chef Sam Kane: \u201cI call it a grocery store with a wine bar.\u201d The Boathouse Group partnered with Kane to rebrand the parkside venue occupied by The Boathouse Palm Beach, which is now slated to close on Sunday, September 14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt used to be a homewares store [with] a cafe, but didn\u2019t have any [great] point of difference,\u201d Kane says. \u201c[Now], day-trippers will be able to pop in for supplies, some produce, a sandwich or some sunscreen.\u201d The Corner will be led by seasonal produce. Trent van der Jagt Kane worked at high-profile venues such as Bistro Moncur in Woollahra before relocating north for a five-year stint as head chef at Merivale restaurant Bert\u2019s Bar & Brasserie in Newport. When he left Bert\u2019s to spend more time with his young family, the chef decided to stay on the northern beaches. Inspired by the chef\u2019s relationships with food producers, The Corner plans to sell hard-to-find ingredients Kane himself would like to buy, while offering a strong eat-in program. As well as the daytime eat-in offering, on Friday and Saturday nights Kane will put his kitchen apron back on to pump out an $85 fixed-price dinner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be some similarities to the way I built dishes at Bert\u2019s, [including] elements of the crudo,\u201d Kane says. \u201cBut [the menu] mostly [consists of] new stuff built around the produce and [seafood] out of the Hawkesbury.\u201d Etheus opened at the former home of Promenade Bondi Beach. Steven Woodburn Going Greek One of the emerging trends on the Sydney waterfront is the number of restaurants pivoting to Greek food. Bondi Pavilion restaurant Promenade Bondi Beach recently joined the party, relaunching as Etheus in August. Now, diners plough through plates of spanakorizo or king prawn saganaki as they watch the waves roll in to Bondi Beach. It\u2019s a similar story at Woolloomooloo, where seafood restaurant Manta was reborn as the Greek-leaning restaurant Akti in June, and at Kyle Bay, where Jaaks Restaurant and Bar reopened on Friday, September 12 with a new concept and design revamp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJaaks head chef Arman Uz, who drew on his Turkish heritage during his previous role as executive chef for the hospitality group behind Sydney restaurants such as Maydonoz and Baharat, hopes the waterside restaurant can bring Greek island vibes to Sydney\u2019s southern suburbs.

Jaaks is ditching its upmarket, fine-dining pitch, and re-booting as a mezedopolio (tapas bar). \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d Uz says. \u201cTo me, degustation is a bit boring. Special occasion places, people need to plan [ahead]. [But, within our new format], you can [choose to] come for a couple of dishes, or a set menu.\u201d Greek food isn\u2019t new turf for Uz, who worked at Jaaks when he arrived in Sydney in 2017. He\u2019ll give the dishes his own twist: lakerda (preserved fish) with green tomato and papara, and salmon belly substituted for pork in a retooled version of Cyprus sausages known as sheftalies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFood doesn\u2019t have borders, Turkey and Greece share [many] common dishes,\u201d he says.

Got it Share\n\nThe only thing more unusual than the location of new eatery Sega is the pizza it serves. Inside a functioning laundromat on Elgin Street in Carlton, the team behind nearby Italian restaurant Al Dente Enoteca are putting their own spin on a style of stuffed pizza found across Italy. The pizza shop is housed inside a functioning laundromat in a glass-walled space that was about to be demolished. Chris Hopkins Chef and co-owner Andrea Vignali wasn\u2019t on the hunt for another venue. But the idea came to him when he was at Soap Spot Laundrette doing washing for the restaurant and noticed a defunct glass-walled cafe space which was once briefly home to coffee shop Two Snakes. \u201cI went back to have another look and saw it about to be demolished ... to put in vending machines,\u201d says Vignali. \u201cThe next thing you know I\u2019ve signed a lease on WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018No one really does it like this [in Melbourne].\u2019 Chef Andrea Vignali Structurally, little has changed. Sega has just freshened up the existing cafe space at the front of the laundromat, adding some new seating and splashes of pastel-green paint, which also colour the small but sunny courtyard beyond the washing machines. 1 / 8 Owner-chef Andrea Vignali preparing Sega\u2019s prosciutto di carpegna pizza.

Sega deals in what the team has dubbed pizza chiusa (\u201cclosed\u201d in Italian), inspired by the stuffed pizza farcita found across Italy. Instead of topping the pizza, the good stuff goes inside, creating something like a circular sandwich. At Sega, they cut each pizza base like a bread roll, load it with your fillings of choice and toast it until golden and gooey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article \u2018If you see hi-vis, keep going\u2019: Melbourne\u2019s most hidden restaurants and takeaway spots Vignali has collaborated with South Melbourne\u2019s Focacceria Pugliese on a custom pizza dough that\u2019s par-cooked in a wood-fired oven. It\u2019s delivered daily, ready to be filled before it finishes cooking in the sandwich press. \u201cWhen you eat it from the toaster, it has that wood-fired pizza taste,\u201d says Vignali. \u201cNo one really does it like this [in Melbourne].\u201d More classic options include ham and cheese, spicy salami with fior di latte and Vignali\u2019s own chilli paste, and a four-cheese combo of provolone, mozzarella, stracciatella and brie. Others are more cheffy, like one with rare roast beef from Al Dente and horseradish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s $22 for a full pizza, $15 for half, and $15 for toasties made with sourdough instead. The offering also includes drinks, such as matcha lattes and St Ali coffee, as well as a green-tinged hybrid tiramisu that combines both products for maximum caffeination. Plus, Sega is the only place you can get Tarts Anon sweets outside the latter\u2019s own locations, so you might find the pastry cabinet lined with anything from pecan slices to tiny rhubarb tarts.

        "text": "Treasury yields eased in the bond market following the release of economic reports, which were some of the final data releases left that could sway the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking before its meeting next week. The unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will cut its main interest rate for the first time this year.\n\nOne of Thursday\u2019s reports said more US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the number of layoffs could be rising. It\u2019s the latest discouraging signal on the job market, where hiring has slowed substantially. The labour market had seemed to be settling into a low-hire, low-fire state, but an increase in layoffs could put it in an even tighter vise.\n\nThe hope on Wall Street has been for a slowdown, but only for a precisely measured one. The job market has to be worrying enough to get the Fed to cut interest rates, which can give a kickstart to the economy and to prices for investments, but not so weak that it causes a recession.\n\nThe Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates throughout 2025 because of the threat that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could make inflation worse. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher.\n\nA report on inflation on Thursday showed prices are continuing to rise faster for US households than the Fed hopes, but only by the amount that economists expected. Consumers paid prices for food, petrol and other costs of living that were 2.9 per cent higher in August than a year earlier, a slight acceleration from July\u2019s 2.7 per cent inflation rate.",
