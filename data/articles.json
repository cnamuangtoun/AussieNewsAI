(A Current Affair)\n\nIt means banks charging high fees to those who can least afford it will refund more than $93 million to customers, following ASIC's latest bank-fee review.\n\n\"Despite the improvements banks have made during our surveillance, there is clearly work to be done,\" ASIC chair Joe Longo said.\n\n\"It should not take an ASIC review to force $93 million in refunds or make banks assess their processes to ensure the trust and expectations placed in them are justified.\"\n\nASIC's previous bank-fee report found banks had kept at least two million low-income Australians, who rely on Centrelink payments, in high fee accounts.\n\nIn its latest report, the regulator cast the net over more banks and found even larger numbers of low- income Australians paying too much, particularly First Nations consumers.\n\nCareers that make the banks pause when it comes to securing a home loan View Gallery\n\n\"Our latest work has seen the total amount of bank refunds nearly triple to $93 million, and over one million customers moved into low-fee accounts, saving them an expected $50 million in future yearly fees,\" said ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland.\n\nProducts and processes across the 21 banks reviewed varied, along with banks' responses.\n\nThree of the four banks featured in ASIC's initial report - the ANZ Bank, Westpac and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank - have now committed to provide refunds of bank fees to a broader group of low-income customers who have been in high-fee accounts.\n\nNow after the latest review by the watchdog, more than 920,000 low-income customers\ufeff are in line to receive refunds totalling more than $93 million.",

(ABC Coffs Coast: Toby Hemmings)\n\n\"Modular and prefab are much better in terms of flexibility for the architect and they're much more energy efficient.\"\n\nState and federal governments are trialling modular housing, with the latest federal government budget investing $54 million to support the industry.\n\nNSW, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania have invested in pre-fabrication for social housing.\n\nSo far, NSW has rolled out modular social housing in South Grafton and Wollongong, with builds in Lake Macquarie and Shellharbour expected to be delivered by the end of the year.",

(Supplied: Seraphinne Vallora)\n\nWho created the images?\n\nThe images were created by London-based AI marketing agency Seraphinne Vallora.\n\nCo-founded by former architects Valentina Gonzalez and Andreea Petrescu, the company builds fashion campaigns for major brands using artificial intelligence.\n\n\"When we started, no one was doing this,\" the co-founders told the ABC in a statement.\n\n\"But with the global attention we've received and the results we've shown, we're seeing a massive shift in awareness.\"\n\nValentina Gonzalez and Andreea Petrescu are the co-founders of Seraphinne Vallora. (Supplied: Seraphinne Vallora)\n\nThey scored the Guess campaign after co-founder Paul Marciano \"slid into their DMs\" on Instagram.\n\nOnce they'd worked with the brand to learn their creative vision, Seraphinne Vallora generated the imagery.\n\nIt's a process they say can take several weeks and hundreds of iterations, as they work to perfect the texture, movement and details of the advertised product.\n\nThe resulting Vogue spread featured summery images of a blonde model wearing a floral mini dress and a striped maxi dress.\n\nIn one corner, there's a subtle disclaimer that the images are AI-generated.\n\nVogue printed a tiny disclaimer in the top-left corner of the right page (circled in red). (Supplied: Seraphinne Vallora)\n\nWhat has been the response?\n\nVogue has faced online backlash for including the ad in its latest print edition.\n\nOne reader says the magazine had \"lost credibility\".\n\nOthers pointed out that with the rise of AI, even models would not be able to compete with unrealistic beauty standards.\n\nVogue directed the ABC's inquiries to Guess, which did not respond by the deadline.\n\nSeraphinne Vallora created several AI-generated images for Guess. (Supplied: Seraphinne Vallora)\n\nRMIT fashion lecturer Rashmita Bardalai says Guess may have opted for an AI-generated model to cut the costs of traditional fashion shoots \u2014 both logistical and financial.\n\n\"It also gives them control over styling environments, so they can place models in any type of digital world,\" she said.\n\nHow could this impact beauty standards?\n\nSeraphinne Vallora says while they can create any kind of model, they've noticed online engagement plummets as soon as they experiment with \"more diversity\".\n\nThis includes different body types and facial features.\n\n\"Our reach would drop from 10 million views per month to just 1 million. That's a 90 per cent decrease,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"We're simply reflecting what has been established culturally and what audiences still respond to today.\"\n\nSeraphinne Vallora says the AI-generated images on their Instagram page are a response to audience behaviour. (Supplied: Instagram/@seraphinnevallora)\n\nDr Bardalai says fashion has made \"real progress\" in diversity in recent years, platforming models with different body types, ages, ethnicities and abilities, as well as trans models.\n\nShe says it's crucial AI is trained with unbiased datasets, to ensure it doesn't promote \"outdated beauty norms\".\n\nSeraphinne Vallora designed a brunette AI model for Guess as well. (Supplied: Seraphinne Vallora)\n\nThe Butterfly Foundation's Melissa Wilton says AI models may spark a surge in disordered eating, as people pursue increasingly \"unrealistic and unattainable\" beauty ideals.\n\nShe said a 2024 Dove report showed almost 50 per cent of Australian women felt pressured to alter their appearance because of online content, even when they knew images were fake or AI-generated.\n\n\"AI may also reinforce Eurocentric beauty ideals, such as light skin, straight hair and thinness, while also excluding racial minorities,\" she said.\n\nGuess has used AI-generated images in its summer campaign. (Supplied: Seraphinne Vallora)\n\nWhat is the future of fashion?\n\nSeraphinne Vallora say they expect demand for their AI-generated models will explode in the coming years.\n\nHowever, they say they don't want to replace traditional methods, but offer a faster, lower-cost \"creative alternative\".\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Bardalai says while AI offers \"really exciting potentials\" in the fashion space \u2014 including supporting sustainable design and reducing purchase returns \u2014 it's crucial it's properly regulated.\n\nSeraphinne Vallora says it can take weeks to create an AI-generated model for luxury brands.\n\nShe says AI images must also be clearly labelled \u2014 currently not a legal obligation in Australia.\n\nBut while AI models could \"disrupt workflows\" in certain fashion productions such as pre-launch teasers and lookbooks, Dr Bardalai says there's little risk they'll replace real-life models entirely.\n\n\"How do we use this as a tool and not as a substitute?\" she says.\n\n\"But the human touch, the emotional intelligence \u2014 of course, that remains irreplaceable.\"",

        "text": "The state government has come under fire over its plans to cut 165 jobs from the only department dedicated to regional New South Wales.\n\nThe Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) said the proposed changes would result in a 4 per cent reduction of staff.\n\nMore than 75 per cent of its workforce is based outside of Sydney, with its headquarters in Orange.\n\nThe department said the majority of the cuts would be made in regional areas.\n\nDPIRD secretary Steve Orr said it was a \"challenging decision\" that was \"not taken lightly\".\n\nMr Orr said DPIRD, previously Regional NSW, had swelled by 1,000 staff to more than 4,700 full-time equivalent workers under the Coalition government and following the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and bushfire events.\n\n\"Those [disaster] programs have come to an end but our workforce has remained reasonably high,\" he said.\n\nNSW Nationals leader and shadow agriculture minister Dugald Saunders described the move as \"cruel\" and \"gut-wrenching\" for country communities.\n\nDugald Saunders says the proposal will reduce the capability of a department designed to help country communities. (ABC Western Plains: Kenji Sato)\n\n\"This is sort of the heart and blood of our regions,\" Mr Saunders said.\n\n\"It's a double whammy, we lose people with capacity in employment in regional NSW and also the people they're supposed to be helping.\n\n\"Some of the teams where these redundancies will come from include agriculture and biosecurity, regional development \u2026 and enabling services in the Rural Assistance Authority (RAA) which is concerning.\"\n\nHe said the move was in direct contradiction of the DPIRD's aim of growing the primary industries sector and helping with economic development in the regions, by supporting the agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining industries.\n\nBudget challenges, swollen workforce\n\nIn a February budget estimates hearing, NSW Agriculture Minister Moriarty foreshadowed the need to reduce staff numbers due to budget challenges.\n\nThe move was expected to save the department approximately $22 million and improve its fiscal sustainability.\n\nMr Orr said the job cuts were set to affect roles that were made permanent despite only having temporary funding, back office administrative roles and duplicate management positions across several divisions.\n\n\"We've reduced our temporary workforce, our casual workforce. The challenge has very much been on our permanent workforce,\" he said.\n\nSteve Orr says a majority of cuts will come from regional areas. (Supplied: DPIRD)\n\nHe said the proposed job cuts would impact a small number of roles within the Rural Assistance Authority (RAA), which administers financial assistance to rural businesses and people during times of hardship, such as flood and drought.\n\nHe said there was no plan to reduce any RAA roles in grant administration.\n\nChanges to Local Land Services and Fisheries and Forestry have been ruled out.\n\n\"In terms of the direct services and front-line services which the department offers, there won't be impact on those particular services,\" Mr Orr said.\n\nThe number of senior executive roles has already been reduced by 15 per cent over the past two years, which rose by more than 50 to 192 between 2019-2023.\n\nDPIRD ruled out the removal of any RAA roles that assist primary producers with grants during natural disasters. (ABC Local: Margaret Burin)\n\nMr Orr said it was only a proposal at this stage and that no final decisions have been made.\n\n\"It's certainly challenging right across the department in terms of the impact that this will have on people,\" he said.\n\nThe DPIRD will undertake consultation over the next fortnight with impacted staff and public sector unions.\n\nThe total number of staff that will be affected is to be determined afterwards.\n\nDPIRD said in a statement that affected staff would be offered redeployment opportunities within the state's public service.\n\nThe ABC has contacted NSW Agriculture Minister Tara Moriarty for comment.",

        "text": "There's always been something about Finn Russell that sets him apart.\n\nOftentimes, it's his manner on the field, a sense that he is seeing things a little bit quicker than those around him.\n\nA darting run here, a no-look pass there, a chip kick out wide that catches half the crowd wondering what he has seen that they have not.\n\nIt is a flickering of brilliance that surrounds him whenever he gets the ball in his hands.\n\nHe is Scotland and the Lions' chief conductor, a maestro of rare talent, directing his Lions across the field with the confidence that only comes from the experience and self-belief that abounds from the 32-year-old.\n\nBut in the bowels of the MCG after the dramatic, last-gasp second Test victory, Russell stood out for other reasons.\n\nOne, he was wearing a Wallabies jersey at least three sizes too small for him \u2014 it was Tom Lynagh's, who professed to being a little starstruck when they opposed each other in the first Test.\n\nTwo, he had a garland of Caramilk Wallabies around his neck, provided by Bundee Aki.\n\n\"I think it's from Tonga,\" Russell said, by way of explanation.\n\n\"My daughter's been eating the chocolates,\" he added, a wry grin on his face.\n\nEven in a nondescript, breeze-blocked corridor, Russell finds a way to stand out.\n\nFinn Russell was given a chocolatey necklace to wear post-match. (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nCompleting a series victory with a game to play is huge for Russell, the continuation of a superb 2024/25 season where he has shrugged aside the one thing that had perhaps counted against him when his name was mentioned among the game's greats \u2014 a lack of trophies.\n\nScotland have improved out of sight since he made his senior international debut in late 2014, with the side finishing bottom of the Six Nations ladder the following spring without a win.\n\nA winless Championships has not happened since, but the Scots have still struggled to challenge the big boys of Europe, with an average finishing position of fourth.\n\nA lack of trophies has followed him domestically, too, be it with Glasgow Warriors or Racing 92.\n\nBut that changed when he moved to Bath, with whom he won the Premiership/Premiership Rugby Cup double, as well as the European Challenge Cup.\n\nFinn Russell won the Premiership final with Bath earlier this year. (Getty Images: Michael Steele)\n\nNow, in his third Lions tour, Russell has finally tasted success with a touring side \u2014 and as the side's undisputed number one stand-off.\n\n\"This year has been a very special year for myself,\" Russell said at the MCG.\n\n\"We won a couple of titles in Bath and I've not won much in my career, so to have won two with Bath and then this now, it's amazing. It's so special.\"\n\nRussell has been at the heart of everything the Lions have achieved on tour.\n\nIn the first Test, in Brisbane, it was the laconic Scot pulling the strings with a skill and speed that the under-prepared Wallabies simply had no answer to.\n\nThe Lions' opening try was a case in point: A darting run past one marker. An offload out of contact to release the man on his right. A floating pass all the way over three dumbfounded Wallaby defenders for Sione Tuipulotu to score.\n\nFinn Russell's magic offload helped keep the Lions on the front foot in Brisbane. (Getty Images: PA Images/David Davies)\n\nIt was textbook brilliance.\n\nIn Melbourne, it was different, but Russell was still there, crafting a complicated puzzle that eventually paid off.\n\nAfter the Wallabies scored their first points of the game, Russell gave the hosts a reminder that you simply cannot take your eyes off him, getting to halfway and punching a restart over the retreating defenders into the corner.\n\nIt was a reminder that, even if things were not going his way, the mercurial Scot had the capacity to simply will something into being.\n\nAs the game progressed, the Wallabies showed they were no longer the inert, overwhelmed squad who were cowed by the might of the British Isles' best.\n\nThe hosts had come out firing.\n\nSo Russell, without the plentiful ball he had enjoyed in Brisbane, made his impact in other ways, namely via some massive kicks out of hand to put the Lions on the front foot.\n\nFinn Russell's kicking game out of hand at the MCG was superb. (Getty Images: David Rogers)\n\n\"It's something I've been working for a little bit on this tour, especially in terms of getting that ball as far to their tryline as possible,\" Russell said.\n\n\"I had a few nice kicks today, which is good, and I think it's kind of my job. If I can get that as close as possible to the line, then we can launch different attacks off that.\n\n\"We can have a quick chat before the penalty [about] what we think and I'll say let's see where the kick goes, but if I miss it, it's OK. It's kind of confidence to myself that I can execute.\"\n\nThe Lions needed that degree of confidence and composure to fight back from 18 points down \u2014 the largest deficit the Lions have ever recovered from in a Test match \u2014 to score a winning try in the final seconds.\n\nRussell and his scrum half Jamison Gibson-Park were everywhere in that final passage of play, pulling those strings and ensuring the Lions got their magic moment.\n\nFinn Russell orchestrates everything that the Lions have done in the Test series.

(ABC News: Malcolm Sutton)\n\nBill said Uber drivers had a certain amount of time to accept a trip request. However he some drivers purposefully allowed the request to expire.\n\n\"At the airport, there's a queuing system, it's first in, first out,\" he said.\n\n\"But if [an Uber driver] doesn't accept the trip, it will go to the next driver, and then if he doesn't accept the trip, then so on and so on.\n\n\"All of a sudden, the app will determine that there's not enough drivers in the area, so the price will start to surge in that specific area.\"\n\nUnion aware drivers gaming system\n\nThe national secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Michael Kaine, told triple j hack he was aware of Uber drivers gaming the system, but he said it was for a valid reason.\n\n\"Drivers are innovative, they will band together, they will manipulate the system to try and push the prices up,\" he said.\n\n\"Because when the prices are up, the drivers get a fairer cut.\n\n\"A cut that allows them to pay for their fuel, to pay for their insurance, to pay for the running of the vehicle, to pay for their workers' compensation.\n\n\"Things that Uber expect them to bear but they're not providing them the rates to bear them.\"\n\nMichael Kaine says Uber drivers are innovative and will do \"whatever they can\" to make a living. (ABC Radio Brisbane: Kenji Sato)\n\nLast year, the government created legislation that introduced powers for the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for gig economy workers, including rideshare drivers.\n\nThese new laws mean the Fair Work Commission can set a base rate of pay, something which would mean rideshare drivers would get the same pay, no matter which app they worked for.\n\nMr Kaine said \"those rights are just in the process of being built\" and Uber drivers should be paid more in the meantime.\n\n\"They shouldn't have to be trying to manipulate the system just to make a living for themselves and their families,\" he said.\n\n\" Every Australian worker deserves reasonable pay. \"\n\nLoading...\n\nIn a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company had community guidelines which set out what \"behaviour isn't appropriate and what will cause a user to lose access to their Uber account\".\n\n\"Fraudulent activities such as deliberately increasing time and distance of a trip, accepting trip, order or delivery requests without the intention to complete, may result in loss of access to the Uber apps,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We work to inform driver partners and riders about those standards and take action to hold them accountable for their behaviour.\"\n\nThe company also said that up-front pricing that allowed riders to see an estimated cost of their journey before booking a car would help improve transparency, \"giving riders the option to decide how they get around, in a way that best suits their needs, timing, and budget\".\n\n'A bit of bulls***'\n\nAlex (left) and John say that it is not fair Uber drivers are gaming the system. (triple j hack: Rachel Rasker)\n\nFor 18-year-old Uber customers Alex and John, drivers on the platform often manipulate the system.\n\n\"That's a bit of bullshit, to be honest with you,\" Alex said.\n\n\"I mean, I definitely think they [Uber drivers] should be getting paid more.\n\n\"[But] I don't know about putting it on the customers, as opposed to the company, but I understand the struggle.\"\n\nJohn put forward an alternative solution for drivers.\n\n\"I'd almost rather they ask for a tip than just artificially pump the prices,\" he said.\n\n\"Because that's what it is.\"\n\nNeev says it is \"not good enough\" that some Uber drivers are passing an extra costs onto customers.

(ABC Rural: Melanie Groves)\n\nHe said the bees were expected to be transported via road train later this week, but sending bees across the Nullarbor came with its challenges.\n\n\"The thing with bees is you can't leave them on the truck for very long. You want to get them on and off there as quickly as you can,\" he said.\n\n\"They need around 2,000 beehives, but we are transporting around 600, so hopefully this will get some bees into their orchards.\"\n\nBrendon Fewster has led the hive mobilisation alongside a colleague. (ABC Rural: Jessica Hayes)\n\nMr Fewster said once the almond pollination season was over in South Australia, bees could not be returned west due to strict biosecurity protocols.\n\nSeasonal strain\n\nMr Fewster, a longtime beekeeper from the Gingin area, said the most recent season had also been one of the most challenging he could recall in Western Australia.\n\n\"We've had a lot of long, dry summers. The trees and bush are struggling,\" he said.\n\nThe WA beehives were purchased by a grower in South Australia. (Supplied: Brendon Fewster)\n\n\" It's the poorest season I've had \u2014 and I've been in the industry for about 30 years. \"\n\nBut despite the challenges, the director of the council did not rule out the cross-border collaboration becoming ongoing.\n\n\"We've been in contact with the almond growers over there, and it looks like this could become something that WA supports ongoing,\" Mr Fewster said.\n\n\"We've done it in such short notice, with only with about 10 days notice for our beekeepers.\n\n\"Next time, if we can organise ourselves earlier, I'm sure we could do it again with more bees going into South Australia.\"",

We normally do it ourselves, but yeah, little bit damp at the minute,\" Mr Barrett told the ABC as he raced to refill the aircraft in between showers.\n\nWith farm roads washed out and creeks running, getting onto the paddock to spray or spread fertiliser without getting bogged has been a significant challenge.\n\nKieran Barrett called in the aerial fertiliser spreaders to boost his wheat crop.

(ABC Great Southern: Mark Bennett)\n\nStruggles continue further inland\n\nDespite three strong cold fronts moving through the south west land division in the past week, there are still areas in the eastern Wheatbelt that need more rain.\n\n\"At Merredin, we are going to see slightly drier than average for August but close to median conditions for September,\" Dr Wilson said.\n\nAt Lake Grace and Narambeen, the bureau has predicted drier than average conditions and around median conditions for September.",

        "text": "The United Nations climate chief on Monday urged Australia and T\u00fcrkiye to resolve their long-running tussle over who will host next year's COP31 summit, calling the delay unhelpful and unnecessary.\n\nAustralia and T\u00fcrkiye submitted bids to host the high-profile conference in 2022 and both countries have refused to concede to the other side ever since.\n\nSimon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees COP summits, said the deadlock was undermining preparations.\n\n\u201cA decision needs to be made very quickly,\u201d he said at a Smart Energy Council event in Sydney.\n\n\u201cThe two proponents need to come together and between themselves and within the group to make that decision. The delay in making that decision is unhelpful to the process.\u201d\n\nThe annual UN talks rotate through five regional groups. COP31's host must be unanimously agreed upon by the 28 members of the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) bloc. The UN had set a deadline of June for the group to reach consensus.\n\nAustralia is seeking to co-host next year\u2019s summit with the Pacific to showcase its renewable energy transition. It had hoped to secure the bid, which has majority backing among its regional group, at COP29 in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe UK, a WEOG member, last week reiterated its support for Australia and \"expressed the hope that a decision would soon be reached\" during Australia-UK Ministerial Consultations held in Sydney.\n\nBut T\u00fcrkiye has rebuffed calls to drop out of the race, and instead doubled down on its efforts during interim talks in Bonn last month.\n\nWe have the numbers, but T\u00fcrkiye is closer to most of the attendees\n\nT\u00fcrkiye argues its Mediterranean location would help reduce emissions from flights bringing delegates to the conference, and has pointed out its oil and gas industry is smaller than Australia's.\n\nStiell said the deadlock was now affecting the planning of the COP process, involving thousands of delegates from 200 member countries.\n\n\u201cIn negotiations that are as complex as they are, that lack of clarity creates tensions that are completely unnecessary at this stage,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked for comment, the office of Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen referred to an interview where he said Australia\u2019s bid had the backing of 23 out of 28 WEOG members.\n\nAustralia had also approached T\u00fcrkiye multiple times to find a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution, he said.\n\n\u201cWe've got the votes. We could have all the votes in the world. If T\u00fcrkiye is not going to withdraw, that's still a challenge,\u201d Bowen told The Conversation Politics Podcast on Thursday.\n\nAt the same event, Stiell also called on Australia to set an ambitious 2035 emissions target and accelerate its clean energy transition.\n\nAustralia\u2019s national climate plan, due in September, would be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d that could send a message that \u201cthis country is open for clean investment, trade, and long-term partnerships\u201d, he said.\n\n- With Reuters",

        "text": "A landmark Victorian native title ruling handed down near Mildura has left residents with unanswered questions about how \"exclusive\" native title works.\n\nThe decision from earlier this month granted traditional owners from the Ngintait, Latji Latji and Nyeri Nyeri First Nations groups native title rights over an area along the south side of the Murray River, between Iraak, 40 kilometres south-east of Mildura, and Lindsay Point, 130km west of Mildura.\n\nAnd in a Victorian-first, the Federal Court has determined \"exclusive\" native title rights over some of that land.\n\nThe native title claim stretches from the South Australian border to Kings Billabong Park. (Supplied: First Nations Legal and Research Services)\n\nWhat is exclusive native title?\n\nNative title is a legal recognition that some traditional owners continue to hold rights to their land and waters, giving them the power to move about, camp, hunt, fish and teach on country.\n\nThe strongest form of native title is exclusive rights, which may be recognised in areas such as freehold property owned by an Aboriginal corporation.\n\nFirst Nations Legal and Research Services lawyer Eleanor Kay said it meant \"they've maintained their laws and customs and have an enduring connection to their country\".\n\nSenior lawyers Stacey Little and Eleanor Kay from First Nations Legal and Research Services. (Supplied: Eleanor Kay)\n\nBut Ms Kay said the exclusive native title of the prescribed body corporate, The First People of the Millewa-Mallee Aboriginal Corporation, did not mean land would be \"locked up\" or public access would be denied.\n\n\"There's no encroachment on the public right to access,\" she said.\n\nMs Kay said for most people living in north-west Victoria, the determination was more a legal change rather than a practical one.\n\nShe said farmland remained farmland, public land remained public, and boats still had access to waterways.\n\n\"It isn't going to really change anything for the everyday person living in this part of Victoria,\" Ms Kay said.\n\n\" It's just recognising what has always been their rights to their country and their laws. \"\n\nLatji Latji elder Aunty Janine Wilson and Wiradjuri elder Aunty Suzanne Connelly at the native title determination hearing earlier in July. (ABC News: Timu King)\n\n'It's a responsibility'\n\nThe Victorian government has confirmed freehold title takes precedence over exclusive native title rights.\n\nNgintait man Nathan Giles said the determination was a \"progressive\" decision to give traditional owners clarity and authority.\n\n\"It's not just a right through native title, but it's a responsibility that we have as First Nation mob from here to look after the country,\" he said.\n\n\" It's about protecting and healing our people. \"\n\nLawyer Peter Willis SC acted for the Victorian government in the native title determination. (ABC News: Timu King)\n\nLatji Latji junior elder, Aunty Melissa Jones, said native title meant traditional owners could go about protecting First Nations \"old people\" \u2014 ancestors buried across the Millewa-Mallee \u2014 by restoring the burial grounds without breaking rules or laws.\n\nOne suggestion is for the First Peoples of the Millewa-Mallee to build up logs as a barrier around burial grounds to stop sand from covering the burial sites during winds.\n\n\"You've got to tread lightly when walking on Latji Latji country, because our old people are out there,\" she said.\n\nKings Billabong may be the topic of discussion in further land rights negotiations. (ABC Mildura-Swan Hill: Tyrone Dalton)\n\nKings Billabong on agenda\n\nIn the recent determination, exclusive rights relate to Aboriginal-held freehold land already owned by Aboriginal organisations, or land held in trust or reserved for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples.\n\nThe Victorian government said any existing interest-holders, such as people with leases or licences over Crown land within that area, would be unaffected by the determination.\n\nIf traditional owners choose to exercise their exclusive rights over parcels of land, the First Peoples of the Millewa-Mallee would enter into negotiations with the Victorian government.\n\nThe government said it would go through a three-month public notice period, taking submissions from the public, before any agreement was struck.\n\nOnce agreed, the Aboriginal corporation would then have to apply to the Federal Court to vary the determination.\n\nFirst Nations men and boys celebrate the native title determination earlier in July. (ABC News: Timu King)\n\n\"Areas like Kings Billabong National Park will be part of that second stage of recognition,\" Ms Kay said.\n\n\"Places like Murray Sunset National Park will be subject to an agreement with the state, and we don't know exactly what that will look like.\"\n\nThe native title ruling for the Millewa-Mallee does not provide native title over minerals, petroleum and groundwater, which continue to be owned by the federal and state governments.\n\nThe CSIRO office at Irymple and the Mildura Recreation Reserve are also exempt.\n\nExclusive versus non-exclusive rights\n\nAlongside exclusive rights, there are also non-exclusive rights where the traditional laws and customs of the First Peoples of the Millewa-Mallee operate alongside state and Commonwealth law, and other land titles and licences.\n\nMarrah Law senior lawyer Henry Dow said under exclusive rights, an Aboriginal corporation could enter into an Indigenous land use agreement with another party.\n\nHenry Dow says state and Commonwealth law will often prevail over native title. (Supplied: Marrah Law)\n\nHe said this approach was common in other states, such as Western Australia, where traditional owner groups such as the Banjima People, in the Pilbara region, have entered into agreements with mining companies on exclusively-held land.\n\nOn non-exclusive land, where the state and native title coexist, the rules are a little different.\n\nAnd if they clash, Mr Dow said the law often reads that state and Commonwealth law will prevail over native title.\n\n\"You might have traditional laws, customs and rights within a national park where you would have non-exclusive native title,\" Mr Dow said.\n\n\" Now, under the act, that doesn't mean that you could discharge a firearm near a campground in the park or hunt particular species that might be protected under Victorian or Commonwealth law. \"\n\nThe right to hunt by native title holders was confirmed by the High Court of Australia in 1999 when the Queensland government tried to prosecute traditional owner and native title holder, Murrandoo Yanner, for taking and killing two crocodiles.",

        "text": "On Monday, after the period of exclusive negotiations for the consortium ended, Hutchison announced it remained in discussions with the consortium \u201cwith a view to inviting (a) major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium\u201d. \u201cChanges to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction \u2026 will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,\u201d it said. It also reiterated previous statements that it wouldn\u2019t proceed with any transaction that didn\u2019t have those approvals. Trump isn\u2019t going to willingly allow a Chinese state-owned company to have a substantial interest and say in the operation of the ports in Panama. Credit: Getty Images The key approval needed is, of course, China\u2019s. Hutchison is a Cayman Island-registered, Hong Kong-listed private business founded by Li via the acquisition of control of the venerable Hong Kong trading house, Hutchison Whampoa, in 1979.\n\nIt has reduced its exposure to China and Hong Kong over the years and now generates only about 12 per cent of its revenues from Greater China. It has substantial infrastructure and telecommunications interests in Europe, North America and Australia, where it owns the container terminals in Sydney and Brisbane, a 25 per cent interest in TPG Telecom and a significant portfolio of energy and transport infrastructure assets. Loading At face value, it shouldn\u2019t have been particularly vulnerable to pressure from Beijing, but it has obviously bowed to that pressure, which has reportedly included a directive from Beijing to its state-owned firms not to deal with any businesses linked to the Li family. Li Ka-shing\u2019s son Richard\u2019s ambitions of expanding his insurance business into the mainland have apparently been stalled, if not blocked. The \u201cmajor strategic investor from the PRC\u201d that Hutchison referred to in its stock exchange release is almost certainly the state-owned Cosco, one of the world\u2019s largest shipping and marine logistics companies.\n\nThe buying consortium was told that if Cosco wasn\u2019t included in the deal, the sale of the ports would be blocked. There have also been reports that Cosco is seeking rights that would enable it to veto any decisions by the consortium considered inimical to China\u2019s interests. Including Cosco in the consortium will create another point of tension between the US and China. Hutchison\u2019s ports sale includes assets located in the Panama Canal. Credit: Bloomberg Not only does Trump have a fixation with the Panamanian ports, to the point that he has threatened an invasion of Panama to gain control of them, but his administration has taken aim at China\u2019s global leadership in shipbuilding and container shipping. The US is proceeding with plans to charge punitive fees on Chinese-built ships entering US ports; fees that start at $US18 per net tonne of cargo, or $US120 per container, that would increase incrementally over time.\n\nTrump\u2019s ambition is to rebuild the US ship building and shipping industries. The US builds only a fraction of a per cent of the world\u2019s large commercial ships and has no meaningful presence in the global cargo shipping market. The collision of interests between the two major powers over the ports sale was regarded as important enough for it to be raised at the trade negotiations the US and China held in Switzerland in May. When the deal, and BlackRock\u2019s involvement in the acquiring consortium, was announced, Trump hailed it as both a victory for America and a personal triumph. Trump isn\u2019t going to willingly allow a Chinese state-owned company to have a substantial interest and say in the operation of the ports in Panama. China, which sees influence over the ownership of ports and shipping logistics around the world as a critical component of its geopolitical strategies, isn\u2019t going to readily relinquish either its influence over Hutchison or, if Cosco is successful, an opportunity to gain a more direct stake in the ports.\n\nOne possible solution raised is the carving out of the Panamanian ports from the larger deal, allowing US interests to control those ports while clearing the way for Cosco\u2019s involvement with the rest. That would, however, mean China would be relinquishing whatever influence it has today over the fastest shipping route between Asia and the east coast of America. The other would be that the deal falls over and the status quo prevails, though Hutchison, which stands to clear $US19 billion of cash from a sale, would see that as a major lost opportunity. Trump\u2019s trade wars and his new port charges for Chinese-built or -operated ships will have massively disruptive effects on global supply chains and global port activity and container shipping volumes.",

And while it has distinct echoes of the work of Liane Moriarty \u2013 whose Big Little Lies, Nine Perfect Strangers and Apples Never Fall have been so successfully adapted for screen in recent years \u2013 there\u2019s a pleasing and more grounded nuance to the way the characters and relationships are portrayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBella Heathcote plays Ange, the real estate agent with ambitions to become a developer and transform the sleepy seaside town. She leases the short-term rental to Isabelle, lives next door, frantically curates a perfect version of what she wants life to be, and hovers over the cul-de-sac like something between a guardian angel and a tyrant.

In the Disney+ series The Clearing, loosely based on the true story of Melbourne cult The Family, she was an adult wrestling with the complex relationship with the \u201cmother\u201d (Miranda Otto) who had abducted her as a young child. She has, in fact, been drawn to dark roles since the very start of her career, having made her debut in 2:37, a film about a suicide at an Adelaide high school. \u201cI am drawn to these darker characters who have an evolution from the start to the end,\u201d she says. \u201cIn The Clearing, my character was a broken flower, a little bit lost. But in this, there\u2019s such a drive in Isabelle. It\u2019s unrelenting, and then there\u2019s an aggressiveness to the character, which is really exciting to explore. \u201cI really love that trauma shows up and manifests itself in different behaviours. There\u2019s no right way to deal with trauma. Everyone handles it differently.\u201d On the surface, it would appear there\u2019s not a lot of trauma in her life.

Credit: ABC TV \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I always try to derive from my own past experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course, I have little traumas and things I went through that were not necessarily easy in my life. Me and my mum growing up together, just her and I, and her having schizo-affective disorder, it wasn\u2019t easy. But I still had the best childhood. All I knew was love.

The approach of these banks was varied, including the types of accounts and fees subject to remediation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank said it would not pay back $270 million in fees, saying they were disclosed to customers at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven additional banks committed to paying back $3.6 million, benefiting an extra 45,000 customers.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to improving customer access to low-fee accounts, ASIC said three of the participating banks had worked to migrate over 815,000 more low-income customers from high to low-fee accounts. This included Westpac, ANZ and Bendigo Bank, while CBA was planning to launch a new nominal fee account.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven additional banks had reviewed and improved their migration processes, while an extra nine had made it easier to access low-fee accounts, ASIC said. This includes five banks removing the requirement to attend a bank branch to show a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.\n\n\n\n\n\nNine additional banks have also improved their internal processes to serve First Nations customers, the report says. This included six banks collecting information on customers who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander to inform their service delivery.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Companies exploiting Indigenous communities, banking inquiry told\n\n\"Our intervention has forced many banks to take action, but more needs to be done to ensure financially vulnerable consumers are not put in this position again,\" Kirkland said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We encourage consumers to challenge their banks to ensure that they are in the best account for their needs. More importantly, we encourage banks to do more to proactively identify low-income customers and move them to low-fee accounts.\"\n\n\n\nHow have banks responded?\n\nA spokesperson for ANZ said it has implemented a number of changes since ASIC's first report last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As part of our further work, ANZ has also taken a deliberate decision to expand our remediation payments, leading to a larger cohort of customers being refunded fees and interest. This applies to a broad set of customers, not just First Nations customers,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ANZ believes taking an expansive approach to remediation is the right thing to do. We\u2019ve already refunded thousands of customers and expect these payments to be completed by mid 2026.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso among ANZ's changes are automatically moving customers who receive particular payments into an ANZ account into a low-fee account, unless they prefer otherwise, improvements to its account opening process for these customers and setting up a dedicated support line for First Nations customers.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for CBA said it \"acknowledges ASIC\u2019s concerns and the importance of fair and accessible banking for vulnerable and concession customers\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said CBA had paid over $25 million to approximately 87,000 First Nations concession customer accounts in \"goodwill payments\" \u2014 not as remediation for any contraventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately $270 million in fees charged to about 2.2 million low-income customers between July 2019 and October 2024, referenced in the report, were \"disclosed to customers and were charged in accordance with their terms and conditions,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concession customer group is a diverse cohort, including customers with varying levels of income, savings and home ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our approach focuses on delivering suitable options for this broad range of needs, providing sustainable, full-service banking for all Australians \u2014 particularly those in regional and remote communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson said plans to migrate customers to its new nominal account are \"temporarily paused pending the consideration by the ACCC of the proposed new authorisation for the Banking Code of Practice\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News also contacted Westpac and Bendigo Bank for comment.\n\n\n\n",

If you want to keep them, doubling down on clean energy is an economic no-brainer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's nothing new about Mr Stiell's pitc h- he is urging governments around the world to set ambitious climate targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says Australia is particularly vulnerable - saying climate change will be an economic wrecking ball if Australia doesn't act fast enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says, already, Australian homeowners are paying a cumulative four billion dollars per year for climate change-related disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, into the future, he says climate change could cripple Australia's prodigious food production ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe claims the country could lose 6.8 trillion dollars in Gross Domestic Product by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Climate Change Authority, headed by former New South Wales government minister Matt Kean, is preparing its advice to the federal government, which will inform that decision on precisely what the target will be.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's previously hinted at a reduction of 65 to 75 per cent on 2005 emissions levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kean says Australia has no choice but to be a world leader in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It needs to be ambitious to grab the economic opportunities that Simon so eloquently outlined. We need to make sure that we are leading the way, if we are to develop the industries that are going to underwrite our prosperity into the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision for 2035 has already been delayed by months.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kean says that's necessary to ensure the decision that is eventually made is the right one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've taken the time to do the deep, thorough analysis required. So when we stand up- when the government stands up- we can do so saying this number is in our national interest. So, I'm not going to apologise for taking the time and building the evidence required to get th decision right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kean says those on his former side of politics, like former National Party federal leader Barnaby Joyce, who want to scrap net-zero targets, are out of touch... pointing to the recent federal election result as evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's not the only climate change related fight going on at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and Turkiye are in dispute over who will host next year's United Nations climate change summit, known as COP31.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is seeking to hold the 2026 event in Adelaide to showcase its renewable energy transition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Turkiye is refusing to drop out of the hosting race, saying, amongst other things, that its location in the Mediterranean would actually lower carbon emissions from people travelling to the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Stiell says the UN wants Australia and Turkiye to sort it out amongst themselves, warning that the dispute is harming planning for the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our position is: please, work amongst your peers and resolve this quickly, so we can engage whomever is the successful candidate, so that we can all move the process forward.\"\n\n\n\n",

Thank you very much. Congratulations.\"\n\n\n\nThe US and EU account for almost 44 per cent of global GDP.\n\n\n\nThe deal will see a baseline rate of 15 per cent on goods made in the EU, although a 50% tariff will remain on European steel.\n\n\n\nBoth the UK - which recently announced a trade deal with Washington - and Australia face a 10% tariff on most items.\n\n\n\n\n\nUrsula von der Leyen appeared resigned to the deal for Europe.\n\n\n\n\"15% is not to be underestimated, but it is the best we could get.\"\n\n\n\nEconomists like Carsten, the Global Head of Macro for ING Research, aren't entirely convinced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you look at the economics and when you look where we sat at the start of the year, namely with hardly any tariffs, the European Union will clearly lose from this deal.\"\n\n\n\nAnd some European leaders, like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, are reserving judgement.\n\n\n\n\"I consider it positive that there is an agreement, but if I don't see the details, I'm not able to judge it properly.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump is denying he'd rushed the deal to distract from the Epstein Files saga, which has seen pressure on his administration continue to intensify over its handling of the files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh you've got to be kidding with that. No. It had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\n\nHis negotiators will now look to take another swing at a deal with China, amid reports the trade truce with Beijing will be extended by another 90 days.\n\n",

        "text": "A new report has found one in five Australian households are struggling to pay their energy bills, with renters being more heavily affected due to the \"woefully inadequate\" solar and insulation in rental properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than one in 10 households report spending more than 6 per cent of their income on energy bills, which, according to the Energy Consumers Australia (ECA) report, is a key indicator of energy hardship.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds on lower incomes are more likely to experience some form of financial stress, whether that's being unable to afford electricity bills or having to forgo heating and cooling to save power.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings come after electricity prices rose for almost half a million households in NSW, south-east Queensland, and South Australia on 1 July following an increase to the Default Market Offer \u2014 a reference price for electricity set by the Australian Energy Regulator.\n\n\n\nWhat did the report find?\n\nThe report highlights the dire financial situation facing thousands of Australians who must choose between paying their bills and running their utilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds with incomes of less than $50,000 per year were the most likely to face energy hardship, with 54 per cent of renters and 46 per cent of mortgage holders experiencing financial strain.\n\n\n\nThe report found many of the hardest-hit households are not accessing or aware of government assistance programs aimed at helping to ease energy costs. Source: SBS News These percentages drop markedly as household income increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the highest-earning households with incomes of at least $150,000 or more per year, only 11 per cent of renters and 6 per cent of mortgage holders faced energy hardship.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who own their own homes were far less likely to deal with these same financial pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Stephens, general manager of public affairs and strategy at ECA, told SBS News the findings show that an urgent response is needed from energy retailers and the government to address the financial strain faced by households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without decisive action, many Australians will continue to face unaffordable energy costs, unsafe living conditions, poor health outcomes, and sustained financial stress,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRenters are worse off\n\nStephens emphasised renters are \"disproportionately affected\" by higher energy prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many rental homes in Australia have the energy efficiency of a tent,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not only does this lead to higher energy costs, adding to cost of living pressures for renters, it also affects them financially, because energy inefficient homes cost more to heat and cool, thus further entrenching energy hardship.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The 'sacrifice' some home buyers are making to boost their borrowing power\n\nOne indicator of this is the proportion of households with access to solar panels and insulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 9 per cent of renters have access to solar power, compared to 41 per cent of mortgage holders and 48 per cent of outright homeowners.\n\n\n\nRenters are disproportionately more likely to be vulnerable to, or experiencing, energy hardship across all indicators of hardship. Source: SBS News Around two-thirds of renters also lack at least one form of insulation, such as ceiling insulation, floor insulation, double- or triple-glazed windows, or draft proofing, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile 64 per cent of mortgage holders and 80 per cent of those who own their homes outright have at least one of these features.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report argues that landlords aren't incentivised to invest in these features for tenants, as there is a limited financial payoff, while tenants often cannot afford to retrofit or don't want to invest in a property they don't own.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the ACT and Victoria have enforceable minimum energy efficiency standards for rental homes, most states and territories do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to see nationally consistent minimum energy performance standards for all rental properties in Australia,\" Stephens said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, reform is underway in some states.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, all jurisdictions committed to establishing a framework for energy-efficiency standards for renters by the end of 2022, with implementation to follow in subsequent years. While some states have made progress, others have lagged behind.\n\n\n\nWhat can you do about high energy bills?\n\nIf you are struggling to pay your power bills, regardless of home ownership, you do have options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first step is to speak with your energy provider as soon as you can and see what support they can offer you. Tell them you're having a hard time and that you need support to pay your energy bill \u2014 you have a right to receive help,\" Stephens said.\n\n\n\nBy law, providers must inform you if a better offer is available to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also required that all retailers have a residential customer hardship program, for which you can sign up.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows you to access various payment options, including adjusting the frequency or timing of your payments, as well as payment assistance or payment matching.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at comparison website Canstar, said millions of Australians are paying more than they need to for electricity and gas, simply because they haven't compared their options in a while.\n\n\n\nCanstar Blue research shows over two-thirds of Australians have been with the same provider for more than two years. Source: SBS News \"Our research shows switching from an average-priced plan to one of the lowest in the market could save a typical household up to $406 a year in some areas, even more for larger households,\" Tindall told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some households, this could be the difference between clearing their next couple of electricity bills and picking up the phone to their provider to ask them to go into hardship.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "On Monday, after the period of exclusive negotiations for the consortium ended, Hutchison announced it remained in discussions with the consortium \u201cwith a view to inviting (a) major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium\u201d. \u201cChanges to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction \u2026 will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,\u201d it said. It also reiterated previous statements that it wouldn\u2019t proceed with any transaction that didn\u2019t have those approvals. Trump isn\u2019t going to willingly allow a Chinese state-owned company to have a substantial interest and say in the operation of the ports in Panama. Credit: Getty Images The key approval needed is, of course, China\u2019s. Hutchison is a Cayman Island-registered, Hong Kong-listed private business founded by Li via the acquisition of control of the venerable Hong Kong trading house, Hutchison Whampoa, in 1979.\n\nIt has reduced its exposure to China and Hong Kong over the years and now generates only about 12 per cent of its revenues from Greater China. It has substantial infrastructure and telecommunications interests in Europe, North America and Australia, where it owns the container terminals in Sydney and Brisbane, a 25 per cent interest in TPG Telecom and a significant portfolio of energy and transport infrastructure assets. Loading At face value, it shouldn\u2019t have been particularly vulnerable to pressure from Beijing, but it has obviously bowed to that pressure, which has reportedly included a directive from Beijing to its state-owned firms not to deal with any businesses linked to the Li family. Li Ka-shing\u2019s son Richard\u2019s ambitions of expanding his insurance business into the mainland have apparently been stalled, if not blocked. The \u201cmajor strategic investor from the PRC\u201d that Hutchison referred to in its stock exchange release is almost certainly the state-owned Cosco, one of the world\u2019s largest shipping and marine logistics companies.\n\nThe buying consortium was told that if Cosco wasn\u2019t included in the deal, the sale of the ports would be blocked. There have also been reports that Cosco is seeking rights that would enable it to veto any decisions by the consortium considered inimical to China\u2019s interests. Including Cosco in the consortium will create another point of tension between the US and China. Hutchison\u2019s ports sale includes assets located in the Panama Canal. Credit: Bloomberg Not only does Trump have a fixation with the Panamanian ports, to the point that he has threatened an invasion of Panama to gain control of them, but his administration has taken aim at China\u2019s global leadership in shipbuilding and container shipping. The US is proceeding with plans to charge punitive fees on Chinese-built ships entering US ports; fees that start at $US18 per net tonne of cargo, or $US120 per container, that would increase incrementally over time.\n\nTrump\u2019s ambition is to rebuild the US ship building and shipping industries. The US builds only a fraction of a per cent of the world\u2019s large commercial ships and has no meaningful presence in the global cargo shipping market. The collision of interests between the two major powers over the ports sale was regarded as important enough for it to be raised at the trade negotiations the US and China held in Switzerland in May. When the deal, and BlackRock\u2019s involvement in the acquiring consortium, was announced, Trump hailed it as both a victory for America and a personal triumph. Trump isn\u2019t going to willingly allow a Chinese state-owned company to have a substantial interest and say in the operation of the ports in Panama. China, which sees influence over the ownership of ports and shipping logistics around the world as a critical component of its geopolitical strategies, isn\u2019t going to readily relinquish either its influence over Hutchison or, if Cosco is successful, an opportunity to gain a more direct stake in the ports.\n\nOne possible solution raised is the carving out of the Panamanian ports from the larger deal, allowing US interests to control those ports while clearing the way for Cosco\u2019s involvement with the rest. That would, however, mean China would be relinquishing whatever influence it has today over the fastest shipping route between Asia and the east coast of America. The other would be that the deal falls over and the status quo prevails, though Hutchison, which stands to clear $US19 billion of cash from a sale, would see that as a major lost opportunity. Trump\u2019s trade wars and his new port charges for Chinese-built or -operated ships will have massively disruptive effects on global supply chains and global port activity and container shipping volumes.",

And while it has distinct echoes of the work of Liane Moriarty \u2013 whose Big Little Lies, Nine Perfect Strangers and Apples Never Fall have been so successfully adapted for screen in recent years \u2013 there\u2019s a pleasing and more grounded nuance to the way the characters and relationships are portrayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBella Heathcote plays Ange, the real estate agent with ambitions to become a developer and transform the sleepy seaside town. She leases the short-term rental to Isabelle, lives next door, frantically curates a perfect version of what she wants life to be, and hovers over the cul-de-sac like something between a guardian angel and a tyrant.

In the Disney+ series The Clearing, loosely based on the true story of Melbourne cult The Family, she was an adult wrestling with the complex relationship with the \u201cmother\u201d (Miranda Otto) who had abducted her as a young child. She has, in fact, been drawn to dark roles since the very start of her career, having made her debut in 2:37, a film about a suicide at an Adelaide high school. \u201cI am drawn to these darker characters who have an evolution from the start to the end,\u201d she says. \u201cIn The Clearing, my character was a broken flower, a little bit lost. But in this, there\u2019s such a drive in Isabelle. It\u2019s unrelenting, and then there\u2019s an aggressiveness to the character, which is really exciting to explore. \u201cI really love that trauma shows up and manifests itself in different behaviours. There\u2019s no right way to deal with trauma. Everyone handles it differently.\u201d On the surface, it would appear there\u2019s not a lot of trauma in her life.

Me and my mum growing up together, just her and I, and her having schizo-affective disorder, it wasn\u2019t easy. But I still had the best childhood. All I knew was love.

Picture: NewsWire/ Jeremy Piper.\n\nNSW Bar Association Common Law chair David Hooke SC agreed with assertions from shadow treasurer Damien Tudehope that changes to a worker\u2019s right to a negligence claim were a \u201cmassively significant removal of workers\u2019 rights\u201d.\n\nThe inquiry was told Labor\u2019s proposed reforms would remove the ability for a psychologically injured worker to make a claim of negligence against their employer over their handling of a complaint unless they were above a 31 per cent WPI.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPeople rated at such a level are generally considered to not be fit to work again.\n\n\u201cOne can take it to extremes without being overly rhetorical about it because the effect of it would be that an employer could have numerous reports of the bullying or harassing conduct, do absolutely nothing about it, have the injury develop, have the injury continue to deteriorate in severity, and have no liability for common law damages unless the WPI was at least 31 per cent,\u201d Mr Hooke said.\n\nA range of legal experts, including from the Law Society of NSW and the Australian Lawyers Alliance, gave evidence on Tuesday, telling the inquiry they had not seen evidence of lawyers or doctors gaming the workers\u2019 compensation system through \u201ccoaching\u201d.\n\nThe committee has previously heard evidence that the biggest drivers of the deterioration of the scheme were \u201cever-rising WPI assessments\u201d and a rising number of new psychological claims.\n\nMr Oyetunji, whose role is independent from the government, told the committee on Tuesday that in terms of psychological claims the focus should be on claims management and addressing \u201croot causes\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA review of relevant audit office reports to the NSW parliament over the past 15 years shows that there have long been concerns about the financial sustainability of workers\u2019 compensation schemes,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Oyetunji quoted a 2011 report by the NSW Audit Office that warned the scheme was deteriorating, with \u201cliabilities increasing significantly\u201d, and that it may not be able to \u201csustain long-term funding\u201d.\n\nThe hearing comes as Mr Latham faces a series of troubling scandals, including allegations he abused his former partner.\n\nMr Latham has repeatedly denied the allegations, which are untested and part of an application for a private apprehended violence order filed with the Local Court by his ex-partner, Nathalie Matthews.\n\nMr Latham has not been charged with any criminal offence.\n\nThe Liberal Party has accused the state government of attempting to \u201cdiscredit\u201d amendments to Labor\u2019s reforms, put forward by Mr Latham and the opposition, \u201con the basis that Mr Latham\u2019s name is attached to them\u201d.\n\nNSW Treasurer Daniel Mookhey has so far rejected the proposed amendments. Picture: NewsWire/ Gaye Gerard\n\nMr Tudehope condemned Mr Latham\u2019s behaviour but noted the amendments were put forward before the allegations were made and defended talks with Mr Latham on the amendments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMark Latham is an elected member of parliament,\u201d Mr Tudehope said.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic of the manner in which the upper house operates is that I\u2019ve got to deal with all people in the upper house, notwithstanding that they do and say things that I don\u2019t agree with and would never endorse.\n\n\u201cBut, at the same time, I need to, in fact, occupy my position as the leader of the opposition in the upper house and achieve outcomes which I think deliver better results for legislation throughout.\u201d\n\nMr Tudehope said Mr Latham had \u201ctainted the whole of this process by what has occurred in relation to a whole lot of other issues\u201d, in regard to the proposed amendments.\n\nGreens MLC Abigail Boyd told the ABC her party had not made \u201cagreements or amendments with Mr Latham of any kind\u201d, and criticised Premier Chris Minns for singling out Mr Latham\u2019s role in the amendments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really telling that the moment that these particular revelations came out, the first thing they (Labor) did was call on the Coalition and the Greens to no longer \u2018work with Mark Latham on a particular Bill\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nNSW shadow treasurer Damien Tudehope said the opposition\u2019s amendments would save \u2018marginally less\u2019 than Labor\u2019s. Picture: NewsWire / Nikki Short\n\nMs Boyd told ABC 702 host Hamish Macdonald that Mr Latham had been \u201cvery unfairly attacking\u201d her for a long time, and assertions that she was now working with the former Labor leader were \u201cvery offensive\u201d.\n\nTreasurer Daniel Mookhey has so far rejected the proposed amendments, telling reporters on Friday that modelling from iCare of some of the amendments would \u201cpunish workers\u201d and increase premiums.\n\n\u201cMy message is clear to the Liberal Party: side with small business, side with victims of sexual harassment. Don\u2019t side with Mark Latham,\u201d he said.\n\nThe modelling reportedly found the proposed amendments put the burden on victims of sexual and racial harassment, as well as bullying, by requiring that they prove the perpetrator intended to harm them.\n\nMr Tudehope said the opposition\u2019s own modelling showed the amendments would achieve savings \u201cmarginally less\u201d than those the government claims it will deliver.\n\nThe government said the proposed legislation will address a \u201clack of focus on preventing psychological injury\u201d at work, adding: \u201cJust 50 per cent of workers with psychological claims are back at work within a year. For physical injuries, the rate is 95 per cent.\u201d\n\nThe hearing will continue on Tuesday.",
