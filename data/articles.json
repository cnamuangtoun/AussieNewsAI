        "text": "Leonard Lauder, the eldest son of cosmetics pioneers Est\u00e9e and Joseph H. Lauder and the former head of cosmetics giant Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, died on Saturday, according to an announcement by the company. He was 92.\n\n\"Throughout his life, my father worked tirelessly to build and transform the beauty industry, pioneering many of the innovations, trends, and best practices that are foundational to the industry today,\" Leonard's son William P. Lauder, who serves as chairman of the company's board of directors, said in the statement.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family in New York City, Leonard Lauder as a boy would join his mother on sales calls in salons and helped her pack boxes of powder and cleansing oils.\n\nLeonard Lauder, the eldest son of cosmetics pioneers Est\u00e9e and Joseph H. Lauder, pictured here in 2014. (Dennis Van Tine/PA Images/Getty Images)\n\nHe would later attend and graduate from Columbia University's School of Business after serving as a lieutenant in the US Navy for three years.\n\nHe formally joined Est\u00e9e Lauder at age 25 in 1958, when the company had just a handful of employees and under $1 million (approx. $1.5 million) in sales.\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies would grow into a global empire with a portfolio that includes Clinique, La Mer, The Ordinary, MAC Cosmetics and Bobbi Brown Cosmetics.\n\nAmong his many roles included serving as president for 23 years, beginning in 1972, and chief executive from 1982 to 1999.\n\nHe was named chairman in 1995 and held the role until 2009, according to the company.\n\nIn 1995, Lauder took the company public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26 a share.\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (EL) now has a market capitalisation of about $24.3 billion.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Lauder had a personal net worth of $15.6 billion.\n\nWhen asked what he would want to be remembered for during a 2020 interview with CBS News, Lauder replied: \"He listened \u2026 and he was kind.\"\n\nHe formally joined Est\u00e9e Lauder at age 25 in 1958. Lauder pictured here in 2023. (Getty Images for Wharton School')\n\nWithin 24 hours of meeting Lauder, one could expect intimate, often handwritten, notes from the beauty pioneer.\n\nIt was a sales technique that resembled the professional style of his mother, who was also known for believing business was about developing and maintaining relationships and making people feel important.\n\n\"At the beginning, we never advertised \u2026 we gave out samples,\" he told David Rubenstein, the co-founder of the Carlyle Group, in 2021.\n\n\"We gave out samples that were large enough. If you give a customer a sample of a product and they like it, they come back and buy it again and again and again \u2013 that's what builds the business.\"\n\nLauder has been credited with creating \"the lipstick index\" during the economic downturn following the attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nHe noticed that the purchase of cosmetics, especially lipsticks, tended to be inversely related to the economy because women replaced more expensive purchases with small pick-me-ups.\n\nIn the fall of 2001, US lipstick sales increased by 11 per cent.\n\nAnd back during the Great Depression, cosmetics sales overall increased by 25 per cent.\n\nLauder was also a devoted philanthropist and art collector.\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies would grow into a global empire.

Lauder, founded the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, which supports drug research to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's.\n\n\"His impact will be felt for generations to come thanks to his tireless philanthropy, advocacy, and creativity in tackling some of the world's greatest challenges. The number of lives he touched and positively impacted across all his endeavours is immeasurable,\" said Ronald Lauder, 81, who serves as chairman of Clinique Laboratories.\n\nThe company's founding family remains the biggest shareholder in the firm, and three members serve on the board of directors.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Judy Glickman Lauder, and his sons William and Gary.",

        "text": "Times were tough in 1989: mortgage interest rates were hovering around 17 per cent, and even Sydney's real estate market was feeling the pinch.\n\nBut someone still found $450,000 to spend on a single ram.\n\nAs the Country Hour gets ready to mark 80 years on air, the ABC picked the brains of former rural reporters about the stories they will never forget.\n\nFor Leigh Radford, the former head of ABC Rural, it was that day at the Royal Adelaide Show when a merino ram sold for a world-record price.\n\nLeigh Radford will never forget the day a ram sold for $450,000. (Supplied)\n\n\"It's just extraordinary that that amount of money was paid for a single ram,\" he said.\n\n\" But it was right at the top of the ride for the Australian wool industry. \"\n\nRiding on the sheep's back\n\nWool was once Australia's biggest export.\n\nIn 1950, the fibre was selling for $37 per kilogram, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but by 1970\u201371 the price had fallen to just $0.60 per kilogram.\n\nWool was Australia's top export in the 1950s. (Supplied: Collinsville Stud)\n\nThe industry was propped up with a Wool Deficiency Payments Scheme in 1971, and then a Reserve Price Scheme for wool, which operated between 1974 and 1991 and kept profits artificially high.\n\nIn 1985, West Australian Neil Garnett paid $10.5 million for South Australia's Collinsville stud.\n\nThe world record sale price for a merino was broken six times under his ownership, with the run culminating in the ram called JC&S Lustre 53.\n\nA record price of $47,000 for a ram was set in 1982 but beaten in 1989. (Supplied: Merino SA)\n\nTony Wetherall was the auctioneer for the record sale.\n\n\"The whole ram shed was absolutely packed, media everywhere; you could hear a pin drop,\" he recalled.\n\nMr Wetherall said overseas interest in Australian genetics helped to drive ram prices to record levels.\n\n\"Back in the day, Collinsville was selling a lot of semen, and that ram may have had a thousand orders at $50 a dose,\" he said.\n\nA 1995 ABC 7.30 story on Collinsville reported that a third of the Australian wool clip had direct genetic links to the stud, making it the most influential in the country.\n\nWool crash\n\nBut just a couple of years after the auction, Leigh Radford was reporting on another turning point for the industry.\n\nWool industry slump Photo shows A woman in a hat and white shirt stands in a sheep yard. Wool production is forecast to drop to its lowest level in 100 years, but young farmers remain optimistic about the future.\n\nThe Australian Wool Commission (AWC) was running the reserve price scheme, setting a minimum price for wool to smooth out fluctuations in prices for growers.\n\nIt would buy the wool that did not sell, store it, and sell it later when the market recovered.\n\nBut demand was softening and sometimes 90 per cent of the offering was being bought by the commission.\n\nMr Radford was soon reporting on the collapse of that scheme.\n\n\"It became like printing money, it became too good,\" he said.\n\n\"Supply ran ahead of demand, prices got to 1,200c per kilogram on an average basis and the floor price was running at about 870c.\"\n\nThe Collinsville Stud went into receivership in 1991, owing $43 million.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, it was reported Australian greasy wool production had fallen by 35 per cent.\n\nWhat happened to the ram?\n\nPaddy Handbury, a nephew of Rupert Murdoch, bought Collinsville in 1995 and Tim Della came on board as stud manager in 2008.\n\nMr Dalla was at the Adelaide Show that day as well, but he was just seven years old.\n\nHe is now Collinsville Stud's general manager and he said Lustre, the record-breaking ram, was put to work producing semen to sell for artificial insemination.\n\nTim Dalla (left) became manager of the Collinsville Stud and Tony Wetherall (middle) was the Elders auctioneer. (Supplied: Collinsville Stud)\n\n\"A lot of people used him through AI and he threw a lot of progeny,\" Mr Dalla said.\n\nLustre would sire three Adelaide Show supreme champions.\n\nBut the days of rams being worth more than houses appear to be over.\n\nMr Dalla said the top-priced ram since 1989 sold for $115,000 in 2022, a long way off the record price.\n\nSeasonal conditions are affecting wool growers now, with Collinsville recording its lowest rainfall figures since it was established in 1889.\n\nThis season has been the worst since the Collinsville Stud was established. (Supplied: Collinsville Stud)\n\nWhile the industry ponders how to deal with drought and increase demand for wool in the face of ongoing competition from artificial fibres, the Country Hour continues telling the stories of rural Australia.\n\nMr Radford is still broadcasting on the ABC and active in leadership roles in agricultural organisations around the world.\n\nBut he regards his career with the Country Hour as his finest work.\n\n\"It has been such a great privilege to meet people doing amazing things in very understated ways often,\" he said.\n\nThe 80th anniversary of the first Country Hour broadcast is on December 3, a milestone that makes it the longest-running radio program in the Southern Hemisphere.",

        "text": "When Luke Atkinson started a tabletop gaming club more than a decade ago, only 10 people turned up to its first session.\n\nThey squeezed into a small room at the local library to play a single game, and it was an altogether modest affair \u2014 but at its end, Mr Atkinson was jubilant.\n\nHe had only moved to the small town of in Kadina on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula earlier that year, and alongside a friend, Mark Dennett, had founded the group with the idea of making community connections in his new home.\n\nIn that light, the first event had been, for him, an unqualified success.\n\nThe group attracts more than 300 people to play games each year. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Declan Durrant)\n\nBut he could not have foreseen how his and Mr Dennett's club would prove an even greater one: the group, 13 years on, now has its own building, and more than 300 people come there to play games throughout the year.\n\nCopper Coast Tabletop, the gaming club the pair started, still runs three times weekly out of a former weigh station in the nearby town of Wallaroo.\n\nThey play everything, from Monopoly and Cluedo to miniature model games like Warhammer, or the card deck-builder Magic: The Gathering.\n\nThe club has, in many ways, been the beneficiary of the board-game popularity boom that has blown the industries out to an estimated $18.8 billion globally in the past decade.\n\nBut its success is also attributable to a larger social movement that has become particularly important in regional communities \u2014 combating loneliness.\n\nGame board's common ground\n\nIt's no secret making friendships can be difficult for people moving to regions, particularly if they don't play sport. And Mr Atkinson knows that all too well.\n\nSo when he arrived in Kadina, he thought one of his old hobbies might help him and others who felt the same way.\n\n\"When you first move to a town, you don't know anyone, and generally there's a lot of close-knit friendship groups because they've known each other for generations or went to school together,\" Mr Atkinson said.\n\nTabletop gamers meet three times a week in a former weigh station in Wallaroo. (ABC North and West: Declan Durrant)\n\n\"And I've loved board games and miniature games since childhood, for both the challenge and their artistic value, and I wanted to offer that same joy and connection to the wider community.\n\n\"Because developing an environment where people can just come and enjoy hobbies and not feel like an outsider \u2026 and just connect with people, that's so important.\n\n\"Moving to a new place can be lonely.\"\n\nTackling social isolation\n\nAccording to the Department of Human Services (DHS), 27 per cent of South Australians experience persistent loneliness, while 20 per cent experience persistent social isolation, meaning they had infrequent social contact for at least eight weeks at a time.\n\nThe DHS says South Australians are the second-most socially isolated people in the country behind the Northern Territory.\n\nFlinders University senior lecturer in social policy Ben Lohmeyer said in Australia, young people in particular were more vulnerable to loneliness than previously thought.\n\nBen Lohmeyer says a shared interest is a good way to connect with other people. (Supplied: Ben Lohmeyer)\n\n\"The key thing we want when tackling social isolation and loneliness is giving people a chance to make meaningful connections with others,\" Dr Lohmeyer said.\n\n\"Having choice over where they do that, particularly if they're choosing something that's a shared interest, sounds like a great way to build connections and get to know other people.\"\n\nHe said it was important for people to have a \"third space\" \u2014 somewhere outside of work and home.\n\n\"It could be sport, a religious community or a shared interest like gaming.\n\n\"But that third space is really important to give us a sense of connection and combat things like loneliness.\"\n\nA hobby from coast to coast\n\nAcross South Australia, on the Eyre Peninsula, another group of gamers gathers.\n\nIn Port Lincoln, Steven Johnson from the West Coast Youth and Community Support group runs games sessions every Thursday and it expands to more than board games.\n\nSteven Johnson started a Port Lincoln board-games group to help foster connections in the regions. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Duncan Bailey)\n\n\"We noticed that a lot of the clients I was working with, a lot of the people that I met, were gamers of some degree and shared a love for gaming,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n\"Through my program we try and link people who are a bit isolated in the community back into their community in all the wonderful areas that it has.\"\n\nWest Coast Youth volunteer Brett Pullham observes the virtual Dungeons and Dragons board. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Duncan Bailey)\n\nHe said the community was created for people who felt isolated and wanted to make friends who shared a similar interest.\n\n\"It just lets everybody come together in the same physical space and actually create some friendships.\"\n\nJack Treagus, Mr Pulham, Ryan Walker and Mr Johnson duke it out in a Dungeons and Dragons game. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Duncan Bailey)\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nBack in Wallaroo, Mr Atkinson reflected on the 13 years and the hundreds of people who have come along to Copper Coast Tabletop to play.\n\n\"This community is something special,\" Mr Atkinson said.\n\n\"For many of our members, especially those with social needs, the structured nature of games provides a framework for interacting, helping them build confidence and a sense of fairness.\n\n\"We've seen many people grow \u2014 not just in gaming skill, but in confidence and connection \u2014 and that's what keeps us going.\"",

(Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nNathan Pumplin is the chief executive of Norfolk Healthy Produce, a United States-based company marketing the plant.\n\nHe said the tomato had two snapdragon genes added, allowing it to make a class of antioxidants called anthocyanins, whose nutrients created the purple colour and were also associated with health benefits.\n\n\"They're what make blueberries coloured, blackberries, eggplant skins, purple potatoes,\" Dr Pumplin said.\n\n\" The purple tomato is just a tomato \u2014 what's special about it is it has the antioxidants that blueberries have. \"\n\nLong time coming\n\nThe plant was developed by Cathie Martin at the John Innes Centre, an independent laboratory in the United Kingdom.\n\nDr Pumplin says the purple colour is a by-product of the increased antioxidants in the tomato. (Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nShe co-founded Norfolk Plant Sciences, a company aimed at transferring the fruits of the research to people's plates.\n\nDr Pumplin said Professor Martin was a global leader in the study of how fruit and vegetables delivered nutrients to consumers.\n\nProfessor Martin previously received the Rank Prize for Nutrition \u2013 one of the field's most prestigious awards \u2013 for her work.\n\n\"She's also a type 1 diabetic, so her whole scientific career she's focused on ways to make the foods that we eat healthier and more nutritious,\" Dr Pumplin said.\n\nAfter 18 years of development the product was approved to be grown and sold in the US and has been on the market there for two years.\n\nDr Pumplin said the company last year sold more than 100,000 punnets of the fruit at grocery stores and 13,000 packets of seeds to home gardeners.\n\n\"We have a pretty decent cult following,\" he said.\n\nThe genetically modified tomato has been on sale in the US for two years. (Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nGoing global\n\nThe team is now taking the plant worldwide and is focusing on the Australian and Canadian markets.\n\nAll Aussie Farmers, a Victoria-based fresh produce marketing company, has entered an exclusive commercial partnership to bring the fruit here.\n\nManaging director Travis Murphy said there had already been plenty of interest.\n\n\"Food service guys are wanting to know when they can get it for their chefs and our retail guys are asking when they can have it to put into their retail shops,\" he said.\n\nThe tomatoes get their purple colour from snapdragon genes. (Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nHistorically, Australian consumers have been wary of the use of GM opinions\n\nAustralia has strict regulations on growing genetically modified crops and to date only canola, cotton, safflower, bananas and flowers have been approved.\n\nThe Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) is the government oversight body and crops will only be approved if they are proven to be safe for people and the environment.\n\nA spokesperson said a risk assessment of the purple tomato would be undertaken, which would lead to the development of a risk management plan to allow the plant to be grown and sold domestically.\n\nPublic consultation will begin in September.\n\n\"Written comments will be sought and the consultation will be open for at least 30 days,\" the OTGR spokesperson said.\n\n\"Anyone can register to receive notifications on the OGTR website.\"\n\nTravis Murphy says the plan is to roll out the new product to customers in Melbourne first. (Supplied: All Aussie Farmers)\n\nAll genetically modified foods for sale and consumption must also undergo a safety assessment by Food Standards Australia New Zealand.\n\nMr Murphy said the purple tomato would first be grown in greenhouses in south-east Queensland, should approval be granted by early next year.\n\n\"We'll roll it out to our customer base in Melbourne firstly, for the fruit shops and food service,\" he said.\n\nPurple and orange bananas\n\nIf approved the tomatoes will be grown in greenhouses in Australia. (Supplied: Norfolk Healthy Produce)\n\nDistinguished Professor James Dale is familiar with the approvals process for genetically modified fruit.\n\nHe leads the Queensland University of Technology's (QUT) Banana Biotechnology Research Program and has been able to get its genetically modified cavendish bananas approved.\n\nThe banana is resistant to Panama Disease Tropical Race 4, which has threatened commercial production in northern Australia.\n\nProfessor Dale said getting federal approval was difficult and required proof the fruit was safe for human consumption and the environment.\n\n\"The application went to hundreds of pages of information because we had to document how we did all of those measurements,\" he said.\n\nThe process took about 12 months, but Professor Dale said field trials in the Northern Territory had been completed.\n\nJames Dale has been working on developing a genetically modified banana for more than 20 years. (Supplied: Queensland University of Technology)\n\nMore trials will be conducted in north and south-east Queensland over the next three to four months before the crop will be grown commercially.\n\n\"We're just going to make sure that the banana performs as well over in Queensland, because that's where the vast majority of bananas are grown in Australia,\" Professor Dale said.\n\nThe disease-resistant variety is a standard yellow colour, but Professor Dale said the team was working to make bananas healthier and was developing an orange banana high in provitamin A and another high in iron.\n\nHe said a purple banana with high levels of anthocyanins was also possible.\n\n\"The purple patches that you see on banana leaves are actually anthocyanins,\" Professor Dale said.\n\n\" Moving that from just in the leaves into the fruit would be a real advantage. \"",

He's goofy. I think he's the perfect candidate for Rochester, the Red Wings and now the Nationals.\"\n\nSnyder, who wore a number 25 Nationals jersey with \"Bruce\" on the nameplate, said he drove through the night with Bruce and arrived in Washington at about 3am on game day.\n\nBruce sits in the dugout before the MLB game gets underway.

He also did a couple of practice bat retrievals with Mr Snyder's assistance before Nationals catcher Riley Adams stopped to pat him on his way out for pre-game work.\n\nHe did not work during the actual game, however, and will return to lower league duties afterward.\n\nBruce takes a spell during his hectic schedule at the game. (Getty Images: Jess Rapfogel)\n\nBruce is Mr Snyder's second dog work to with the Red Wings, following the late Milo, and both participated in campaigns to raise money for Rochester's Veterans Outreach Center and Honor Flight Rochester.\n\nThis week \u2014 which included an announcement from the Nationals that Bruce had earned a promotion \u2014 generated plenty of buzz even before his debut.\n\n\"Social media, everything like that seems like it's seriously blown up, and we love it,\" Mr Snyder said.\n\n\"Really good publicity with our goal and our mission of bringing people together.

(ABC News: Susan Oong)\n\nAfter a hiatus in 2024, as new artistic director Chris Twite settled in, the festival has returned with a program with enough shock value to keep up the intrigue.\n\nThis year \u2014 the festival's 11th \u2014 offered up coffin rides, an actual car crash, preserved sheep heads in jars, and staples Night Mass, and fire-pit filled Winter Feast and Dark Park.\n\nThe popular winter solstice nude swim is still to come, and will take place on Saturday, June 21.\n\nThe burning\n\nThe procession moved along the city's waterfront to Dark Park, carrying the Ogoh-Ogoh. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nThousands joined the procession of the Maugean skate effigy from parliament lawns to Macquarie Point for the Ogoh-Ogoh burning, marking the festival's finale.\n\nThe Maugean skate is an endangered species found only in world-heritage-listed Macquarie Harbour, on Tasmania's west coast. It is at risk of extinction.\n\nPlane-loads of interstate visitors travelled to Hobart to take part in the festival. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nSpectators packed into Dark Park to watch a timber pyre, with the skate craned atop, burst into flames.\n\nFireworks erupted from behind and within, as the timber structure slowly burned then eventually toppled to the ground.\n\nThe giant skate effigy was craned up to the top of a timber pyre. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nA flame was carried up a ladder by a fearless helper. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nThe Ogoh-Ogoh is based on a Balinese tradition of creating a paper-mache statue embodying chaos and disorder that is then burnt to exorcise negative energy.\n\nThroughout the festival, tens of thousands of peoples had committed their fears on pieces of paper and fed them into Maugean skate egg casings that were later burned with the skate.\n\nMr Twite said each year at the festival a Tasmanian animal under threat or endangered is chosen as the effigy.\n\nHe said the festival creatives work with a team of Balinese artists to create the sculpture and manage \"the receipt and holding of those fears\".\n\n\"It's a great spiritual weight on them to hold all of those fears from those tens of thousands of people, and then to see that those fears destroyed \u2026 it's a beautiful part of the festival,\" he said.\n\nChris Twite, who was announced as Dark Mofo's new artistic director in 2023, following the departure of inaugural director Leigh Carmichael. (Supplied)\n\nSkate the embodiment of biodiversity crisis\n\nLeonardo Guida, a conservation leader at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said there were as few as 4,100 Maugean skates left in Macquarie Harbour, which is also a site for controversial salmon farming.\n\n\"It's quite ironic that by we're burning off our fears and our anxieties, and the fear is quite genuinely that this animal could go extinct in less than 10 years, and this extinction is a global extinction,\" Dr Guida said.\n\nMacquarie Harbour is the only known home of the Maugean skate. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nDr Guida said the skate had become representative of Australia's biodiversity crisis.\n\nSalmon farms posed an extinction threat \u2013 but have they changed? Photo shows A juvenile skate on the sea floor. Tasmania's Maugean skate, a prehistoric ray known to exist only in one harbour on the state's west coast, is at risk of extinction as pollution levels from salmon farming increase, and environment watchers want action.\n\nEarlier this year, federal Labor rushed legislation through the lower house with the aim of guaranteeing salmon farming could continue in the harbour.\n\n\"I really hope that the burning of the Ogoh-Ogoh really does ignite action to save the animal,\" Dr Guida said.\n\nThe federal government has committed tens of millions of dollars towards improving the oxygenation of water in the harbour to \"help offset the affects of human activities\".\n\nWhile Dark Mofo festivities has wrapped up, the event officially comes to a close next week after the Nude Solstice Swim at Long Beach on June 21.",

        "text": "Margaret Niemann laughs off a question about her \"legacy\" in regional healthcare, but her impact is undeniable.\n\nThe retired general practitioner, whose career spanned four decades, was recently awarded an OAM in the King's Birthday honours for her services to medicine as a GP.\n\nDr Niemann's list of achievements is extensive, and includes long stints in remote Aboriginal communities, as well as providing groundbreaking access to mental health support in regional areas, long before such things became commonplace.\n\nEarly antenatal education\n\nGrowing up in a suburban household in the Melbourne region, with no relatives ever working in the health or care sectors, Dr Niemann's choice to go into medicine was unexpected.\n\n\"It just interested me,\" she said.\n\n\"I was curious about how people worked and what made them tick, and I thought medicine sounded like a way I could explore that.\n\nDr Niemann helped bring mental healthcare to Bairnsdale in East Gippsland. (Supplied: Margaret Niemann)\n\n\" That curiosity \u2026 maintained me through my [40-year career]. I just was always interested in the person in front of me. \"\n\nDr Neimann married a fellow med-school student, Michael Dawkins, a \"country boy\" who wanted to go into rural general practice.\n\nThe idea intrigued young Margaret, and they made their home in the East Gippsland town of Bairnsdale in 1984, settling down with their one-month-old baby.\n\nDr Niemann worked there as a GP-obstetrician while having her own children, and quickly noticed a gap in services for new mothers.\n\nPANDA \u2014 Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia \u2014 had started up in Melbourne a few years earlier, but Dr Niemann said \"there wasn't anything in the country at the time\".\n\nShe and some others in the community joined forces to start offering antenatal classes in the area.\n\nThe take-up was high, with strong interest from young mums and it helped solidify Dr Niemann's own interest in the area of mental health.\n\nA remote GP team\n\nAfter 12 years in Bairnsdale and three children, Dr Niemann and her husband needed a change.\n\nIt came in the form of a federal government push to have GPs living in remote Northern Territory communities, which led Dr Niemann and her husband to Maningrida, an Arnhem Land town of about 2,500 people, 500 kilometres east of Darwin.\n\nDr Niemann, left, said she enjoyed working in remote Aboriginal communities. (Supplied: Margaret Niemann)\n\nShe admitted it was nerve-racking, but with her husband, who she says is an \"excellent GP\", they \"made a good team\", providing much-needed healthcare and developing strong bonds with the Aboriginal community.\n\nDr Neimann said she and her husband would often go out hunting, fishing and foraging with the locals, giving them a fascinating insight into the culture.\n\n\"We just clicked \u2014 it worked well,\" Dr Niemann said.\n\nMental health care before its time\n\nDr Niemann said while she loved working in Aboriginal health, she was most proud of her achievements in mental health.\n\nWhen she began in the field, mental health care, as we now know it, was in its infancy, and psychological services in regional areas were pretty much non-existent.\n\nDr Niemann said her earliest work was with people with eating disorders, and it grew from there.\n\n\"There were no psychologists \u2026 so things like anxiety and depression, and even obsessive-compulsive disorder and PTSD were very hard to get any sort of support [for],\" she said.\n\nWhile in Bairnsdale, she began diving into the psychological effects of trauma, which dovetailed with her work in Aboriginal communities, where she quickly recognised the impact of intergenerational trauma.\n\n\"When I started, the idea [of] the psychological effects of trauma and PTSD was just not on the radar,\" Dr Neimann said.\n\n\"People didn't think about it [or] acknowledge it.\n\n\"[But now] it is recognised that it does cause \u2026 ongoing problems. We've progressed enormously from that time.\"\n\n'Life's good'\n\nDr Niemann is quick to point out that throughout her career, especially when working remotely, she has been part of a good team.\n\nShe retired during the COVID pandemic, and is loathe to use the word \"legacy\" when discussing the achievements and career that earned her a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the recent King's Birthday honours.\n\nDr Neimann and her husband still live in Bairnsdale, where she enjoys gardening, baking, crafting and catching up with friends and family.\n\nAfter a long career, \"life's good\", she said.",

(ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\nTwo months ago the Thargomindah township, nearly 1,000 kilometres west of Brisbane, was almost entirely inundated by a record-breaking flood.\n\nReminders of the disaster are everywhere \u2014 in the blue flood markers pasted around the arena, the drone photos scattered near the bar, and the stories exchanged over a beer.\n\nThe record-breaking flooding caused many residents to evacuate.

(ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nShearing and sharing stories\n\nAbout 80 shearers travelled from across Australia and New Zealand to Thargomindah to compete in the quick shears with the lure of a $41,000 prize pool, one of the largest in the country for shearing.\n\nThe event also hosted dachshund races, pig races, a colour run, and a flood debrief panel.\n\nThe Shearers Shindig attracts competitors from across Australia and overseas. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\nBullo Shire acting chief executive Tamie Warner said the flood panel was the first time many of the residents involved in the natural disaster had spoken about their experiences.\n\n\"We worked together, did what we had to do and made it happen,\" she said.\n\n\" But a few got emotional and that shows the effect it has had on a lot of people. \"\n\nTamie Warner spoke on the flood recovery panel. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nAs mayor, John \"Tractor\" Ferguson handed out the cash prize for each category at the end of the night \u2014 several winners shook their heads and insisted the money be returned to the community recovery fund.\n\nEach time, a cheer went up through the crowd.\n\nThe fastest time of the night was 25.52 seconds, taken out by New Zealander Hemi Power.\n\nIn the women's event, Marites Woods was the quickest on the clippers, shearing her sheep in just 33.22 seconds.\n\nThe fastest time of the night was 25.52 seconds. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nFlood impacts region's tourism\n\nThough many residents are still living in caravans, the sight of more caravans rolling into town with tourists is a welcome one.\n\nBulloo Shire Council tourism coordinator Danielle Tuit said the visitors brought a much-needed boost to local businesses.\n\n\"Our tourism industry would normally start on April 1, but that was the night the flood came through,\" she said.\n\n\" It's the ultimate time to visit and it's so very important to these outback communities. \"\n\nThere are flood markers all around Thargomindah showing how high the water came. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\nWhile the number of shindig attendees was down compared to previous years, those who came brought open wallets.\n\nBruce and Noni Kerr were on a road trip to Sydney and stopped in Thargomindah when they heard about the event.\n\n\"We heard it on the news and thought we'd come support them,\" Mr Kerr said.\n\nNoni and Bruce Kerr stopped in Thargomindah on their road trip to Sydney. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\nShearer Atareta Tekanawa-Semenoff was one of many New Zealand competitors who travelled for the quick shears competition.\n\n\"I'm here because I love supporting local outback speed shears and I saw what happened with the flooding,\" she said.\n\n\"Big ups to the community, what a way to come back.\"",

        "text": "This year, OPEC has been gradually bringing back some of the 6 million barrels a day of production it has held back over the past three years, but there is still a lot of spare capacity on the sidelines in a market that the International Agency says is already over-suppled, with the growth rate in supply about twice that of the growth in demand. Of far greater concern than Iran\u2019s own production is that of the other Middle Eastern producers. Iran has the potential, if it chooses to, to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only marine entry point to the Persian Gulf and arguably the most important choke point in the global energy supply chain. Nearly a third of the world\u2019s oil transits through the strait each day, and about 20 per cent of its LNG. If that trade were closed, or heavily disrupted, oil prices would soar, with estimates that they would reach somewhere between $US120 and $US150 a barrel. US President Donald Trump\u2019s misguided trade wars have left the global economy vulnerable. Credit: Bloomberg Traders are clearly discounting that possibility, partly because it would deprive Iran itself of its major source of revenue and upset its major customers, but more particularly because it would almost certainly drag the US, whose Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, directly into the conflict.\n\nIran has, in the past, threatened to block the strait but, apart from laying some mines during the 1980s war with Iraq, hasn\u2019t done so. Loading As long as Israel refrains from attacking its oil exports and the US remains only indirectly involved (by supporting Israel\u2019s defence against Iran\u2019s retaliatory strikes), the arguments for keeping the strait open would be stronger than the temptation to close it. If that were to change, it would be grim news for the rest of the world. Indeed, even the so-far relatively modest impact on oil prices isn\u2019t helpful. Last week, before the conflict began, the World Bank cut its forecast for global growth this year from 2.8 per cent last year to 2.3 per cent. Other economic agencies and forecasters have similarly downgraded the outlook to levels that, apart from the pandemic, were last seen in the aftermath of the 2008\u201309 financial crisis.\n\nThat\u2019s because Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are expected to severely depress global economic growth, and growth within the US in particular. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for US GDP growth by 90 basis points to a meagre 1.8 per cent earlier this year. The World Bank has US growth \u2013 2.8 per cent last year \u2013 halving to 1.4 per cent. Trump\u2019s trade wars have rendered what was reasonable global growth and a strong and out-performing US economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. With Trump\u2019s 10 per cent baseline tariffs on everyone already in place, the average US tariff has leapt from about 3 per cent to something in the high teens. The 90-day pause on his more draconian \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs will end on July 9, when many of America\u2019s trading partners will face even higher rates. The tariffs will undermine US and global growth and push up US and global inflation rates.\n\nConventionally, because they would adversely impact global trade and the global economy, they would also reduce demand for oil. If Middle Eastern supply were disrupted, however, the oil price would spike and add to global inflation, increasing the threat of global stagflation, or the combination of lower growth and higher inflation. When the US released its latest inflation data for May last week, a contributing factor to the headline number of 2.3 per cent \u2013 the best result for more than four years \u2013 was that oil prices traded as low as $US60 a barrel last month. While the inflation data has yet to reflect the impact of the tariffs \u2013 US importers had front-loaded their orders to get in ahead of the tariffs and therefore their impact will be delayed and probably show up progressively in coming months \u2013 the surge in oil prices, thanks to the new outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East, will add to the US inflation rate.\n\nIt also introduces a new dimension of uncertainty for the US Federal Reserve Board, whose Open Market Committee meets this week. Loading There is no expectation that it will cut US rates at this meeting, but the prospect of a September cut \u2013 up for discussion before Israel\u2019s attack \u2013 may have receded if oil prices remain at their current levels, or rise further. Other central banks will have to grapple with the same question mark over the trajectory of oil prices and their impacts on inflation. Trump\u2019s trade wars have rendered what was reasonable global growth and a strong and outperforming US economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Israel, with its strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and its attempt to destabilise the regime, has provided one that will already generate some wider economic stresses but has the potential to do considerably more damage if it doesn\u2019t remain contained.",

        "text": "Days after the meeting, Nganhurra resurfaced \u2013 not physically, but in a public statement by Norwegian company BW Offshore, which announced it had secured an agreement to acquire the vessel. \u201cGiven the limited availability of suitable FPSOs for redeployment, securing this unit places BW Offshore in a strong, competitive position,\u201d chief executive Marco Beenen said. While Nganhurra has been reborn, the question of what happens to offshore oil and gas infrastructure reaching the end of their lifespans is vexed. At an industry conference in Perth last week, delegates discussed the fate of another defunct floating production, storage and offloading facility: the decrepit and government-owned Northern Endeavour. Northern Endeavour, another former Woodside vessel, has for years been moored in the Timor Sea while it undergoes decommissioning.\n\nFour years after Woodside sold the vessel to Northern Oil and Gas Australia (NOGA) in 2015, Northern Endeavour was shut down amid safety warnings from the regulator, and NOGA collapsed just months later \u2013 forcing the government to step in. The Northern Endeavour, pictured in the Timor Sea in 2021. Credit: Boiling Cold Its decommissioning \u2013 funded by a levy on offshore oil and gas producers \u2013 demonstrates the risks of removing these giants from the ocean: in the worst-case scenario, 18,692 cubic metres of crude oil could have spilt into the Timor Sea. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources issued a tender to find a lead contractor for the next two stages of recycling the 43,000-tonne vessel. However, it was unable to find a tender that met the department\u2019s requirements or represented value for money. A spokesman for Resources Minister Madeleine King said the procurement process was ongoing.\n\nAs dozens of oil and gas facilities reach the end of their lifespan, there are growing calls for an Australian decommissioning and recycling industry to capitalise on the opportunities presented by offshore infrastructure. In 2023, King reaffirmed her support for the jobs generated by decommissioning to stay in Australia. \u201cAs industry starts investing to decommission $60 billion in offshore infrastructure, we want as much of that investment to be spent backing Australian industry and Australian jobs.\u201d Loading Australia\u2019s offshore energy operator NOPSEMA said in an information paper in January that, \u201crecent experience indicates that some titleholders do not develop appropriate or timely decommissioning plans, which has potential to increase risk to people and the environment\u201d. Unions say offshore oil and gas workers are perfectly placed to safely and responsibly undertake this work. The Maritime Union of Australia and Australian Workers Union have jointly called on government to reinvest more than $1 billion in levies collected from oil and gas producers into a fledgling recycling industry to safely and responsibly remove offshore infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s steel industry is ready and capable,\u201d said Australian Workers Union national secretary Paul Farrow. \u201cWe have workers prepared to do this job safely and efficiently, and our mills stand ready to recycle high-quality ferrous metals. Sending these materials abroad is a significant missed opportunity.\u201d Loading MUA National Secretary Paddy Crumlin said Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas infrastructure contains an estimated 3.7 million tonnes of high-quality ferrous metal, suitable for recycling into low-emissions steel. \u201cTowing the Northern Endeavour to [a third country] for dismantling is not just an absurd outsourcing of jobs \u2013 it\u2019s a 15,000-nautical-mile climate contradiction,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Key Points Nearly 1.9 million Australians are delaying or skipping critical care due to high specialist fees.\n\nSome specialists charge two to three times the Medicare rate, with annual costs topping $670 for some services.\n\nGrattan Institute urges reforms, including naming overcharging doctors and expanding access in underserved areas.\n\nAbout 1.9 million Australians are delaying or skipping critical medical care due to exorbitant fees for specialist doctors, a report by public policy think tank Grattan Institute has found.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report recommended naming specialists who charge excessive fees and scrapping medicare subsidies for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome private specialist doctors charge patients two to three times more than the rate Medicare sets for those services, the report found.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said patients of one specialist spent an average of $300 per year in 2023 \u2014 up 73 per cent since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage out-of-pocket costs for extreme-fee-charging specialists in 2023 reached $671 for psychiatry services and more than $350 for endocrinology, cardiology, paediatrics, immunology and neurology services.\n\n\n\nThe high costs leave critical health care out of reach for millions, causing patients in poorer pockets of Australia to wait months or years for urgent appointments, and leading to missed diagnoses, avoidable pain and added pressure on hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout four in 10 Australians visited a specialist in 2023/24.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout two-thirds across all specialities are private appointments, with patients receiving a Medicare rebate and paying a gap fee.\n\n\n\nGrattan's Health Program director Peter Breadon said the system was broken from start to end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everywhere, from how the system is planned and how training is funded through to how we target public investment and integrate the system between primary care and specialist care, it all really needs a lot of change,\" he told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Health Minister Mark Butler said private health insurers and specialists needed to do more to protect patients from exorbitant bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the Albanese government would upgrade the Medical Costs Finder, which helps patients find the best value for specialist medical advice, and was committed to working with stakeholders to improve cost transparency.\n\n\n\nThe report also recommends governments provide one million extra specialist appointment services every year in areas that receive the least care, a system in which GPs can get written advice from other specialists, modernise public specialist clinics, and allocate $160 million to expand specialist training for under-supplied specialities and rural training.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Medical Association president Dr Danielle McMullen said public hospital underinvestment and lagging Medicare rebates made it harder for patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The risks of delaying medical care are that the health problem gets worse,\" she said, adding it also puts pressure on GPs and hospitals in public and private clinics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doctors' association supports most of Grattan's recommendations, but said removing Medicare funding from specialists who charged excessive fees was not practical.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs governments negotiate the National Health Reform agreement, McMullen urged leaders to sort out longer-term funding for public hospitals and develop a health workforce data tracker to show where investment was needed.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Tasmania, known to its First Peoples as lutruwita, has long been a flash point in Australia's environmental struggles \u2014 from logging and mining to water protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, a new generation of palawa Aboriginal leaders is stepping up, continuing an ancient legacy of defending Country in the face of environmental destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tasmania, logging is a billion-dollar industry that supports over thousands of jobs and exports millions of tonnes of timber, woodchips and pulp overseas, primarily to feed paper mills in China and Japan.\n\n\n\nBut as vital carbon sinks and biodiversity havens shrink, Traditional Owners argue that the long-term environmental and cultural costs are far greater than the economic gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them is 25-year-old palawa lawyer Maggie Blanden. Last year, she made headlines by rejecting her nomination for Young Tasmania of the Year to protest a date \u2014 26 January \u2014 which she said represents genocide and stolen land.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlanden told NITV's The Point that she was raised with an understanding of both Aboriginal lore and \"settler\" systems and is training to be a lawyer to challenge colonial structures from within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Education is power for our mob,\" Blanden said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our old people were on the front line defending Country and that legacy continues today. They were protesting for their inherent rights to be Aboriginal people and to be on Country and yet they were being persecuted for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Becoming a lawyer was my part in that, breaking down those systems and really bringing us home to that key message . \"\n\n\n\nMaggie Blanden, a 25-year-old palawa lawyer, with the host of NITV's The Point, John Paul Janke. Source: SBS News It's a message that echoes across places like the Styx Valley, a stronghold of Tasmania's ancient forests and a hotspot for protests against logging.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery day vital carbon sinks and biodiversity havens shrink as forests are reduced to woodchips that are shipped offshore to become paper and fill the trays of the world's photocopiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an industry that supports over 5,500 jobs and contributes $1.2 billion to the economy, but Traditional Owners argue that the long-term environmental and cultural costs are far greater.\n\n\n\n\n\nRuth Langford, a Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Wurrung woman born in lutruwita, is one of the cultural caretakers fighting back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not actually a forest, it's a plantation. It's a single species tree,\" she said, gesturing to rows of identical trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is very sick country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concern that we have is these types of plantings create potentially catastrophic bushfires, as well as it's sucking all the water up.\"\n\n\n\nThe state government's Sustainable Timber Tasmania, formerly Forestry Tasmania, manages approximately 812,000 hectares of public production forest and promises a sustainable approach that is socially, economically and environmentally responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 1.2 million hectares of the state's forest is classified as old growth, of which eight per cent faces potential logging within the 'Permanent Timber Production Zone'.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery three years, the government releases a forestry plan that designates large areas for logging that include a patchwork of plantations and old-growth forests and there are fears that more protected areas could be opened up to potential logging.\n\n\n\n\n\nLangford says contractors often have little say in the areas they are harvesting, and many taxpayers are asking why they are continuing to foot the bill for an unsustainable approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't make economic sense,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government is subsidising all the roads, all the departments, and loses all of our carbon, loses all of the biodiversity, all of the water catchment and loses the very potential of what this could be both for timber production and also for future generations.\"\n\n\n\nRuth Langford, a Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Wurrung woman born in Tasmania (lutruwita), is one of the cultural caretakers fighting back. Source: Supplied Palawa woman Carleeta is part of a protest camp in Styx Valley and believes balance is possible and immediate change essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not saying completely stop the whole logging industry,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to go more towards different plantations and alternatives to logging these beautiful old-growth forests that have seen, not only our old fellows, but will see our future generations be able to come and sit under these same trees that their ancestors sat under.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the movement is a deep reverence for inter-generational responsibility. For Blanden, elders like Uncle Jim Everett (Puralia Meenamatta), who still physically defends forested areas, represent that legacy.\n\n\n\n\"He always says it's not about land rights \u2014 it's about the land's right. The right to be cared for. That's what we carry on our shoulders,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs climate change accelerates and biodiversity collapses, Blanden sees Aboriginal leadership as vital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They need us. Country needs us and it is our time to answer that call and come and protect Country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Point airs Tuesdays 7.30pm on NITV, and is available after the broadcast on SBS On Demand .\n\n\n\n",

This is the powerhouse. We're determined to keep that lead. That's why the government's investing strongly here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package includes $280 million to support post, digital, visual effects and video game development.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother $100 million will help kickstart the hunt for a location to serve as Sydney's second film studio.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Graham says there's a critical shortage of production space, with Disney Studios at Moore Park currently the city's only film studio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has played a pivotal role in blockbuster movies like Mad Max Furiosa and The Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Daniel Mookhey expects to see the investment spur economic activity and job creation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The industry supports over thirteen thousand direct jobs, and with this investment, we're confident that it's going to create a great degree of spillover. This is what it looks like to be boosting economic growth in New South Wales in the twenty first century.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the sector already injects more than $1 billion into the local economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe treasurer also announced new plans to cut red tape in an effort to make the movie and game-making as seamless as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of Screen New South Wales, Kyas Hepworth welcomed the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just exciting to see the government standing for the creative work as practitioners and storytellers within the state and we're not only looking at the state what happens in New South Wales affects Australia and elevates our storytelling globally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther states have been competing for big budget films, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland is giving a $71 million boost to its screen industry, and W-A forking out $300 million for a studio complex in Perth.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Homeowners hoping to reduce their power bills by installing solar panels are now considering whether new discounts for solar batteries will be worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1 July, the federal government's Cheaper Home Batteries Program will provide a 30 per cent discount on the upfront cost of installing eligible small-scale battery systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut homeowners like Victorian resident Lee Bolger, who invested in solar panels a few years ago, are now experiencing dramatic drops in their feed-in tariffs and are sceptical about the added benefit of batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeed-in tariffs \u2014 credits issued by energy retailers \u2014 allow solar owners to earn money for any unused electricity they generate, which is fed into the electricity grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rates vary across different states and electricity providers.\n\n\n\nAdam Corrigan, an energy efficiency expert and founder of Your Energy Friend, says each household is different, and there are many other energy-saving options to consider before spending thousands on solar and batteries.\n\n\n\nSolar disappointment\n\nBolger, who lives in the Victorian town of Great Western, says he installed 30 panels on his eight-bedroom home in March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe rents out rooms in his house to boarders and says they use a lot of electricity as they often have the air-conditioning and heating on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis 12-kilowatt system cost him $12,680 after rebates and other discounts, which he estimated he could recoup in around six years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the feed-in tariff at the time was around 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and now he only gets around 6 cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore drops are expected, with comparison website Finder saying the minimum rate for tariffs in Victoria will drop to 0.04 cents from 1 July, although better rates are available depending on the provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifteen years ago, they were as high as 60 cents.\n\n\n\nFeed-in tariff rates for solar panel owners can vary widely across different states and territories. Source: SBS News Bolger estimates his original feed-in tariff of 12c per kWh would have saved him around $1,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen combined with the estimated $1,000 worth of electricity he saves relying on energy generated from his own system, he receives a total benefit of $2,000 per year from his solar panels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the feed-in tariff drops to practically zero, the benefit from his panels will reduce to around $1000 a year, meaning the time Bolger would need to pay off his panels would almost double.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the experience has made him \"indifferent\" about the economic benefits of solar and he won't be recommending it to others.\n\n\n\nLee Bolger says he's now \"indifferent\" to the benefits of solar after his feed-in tariffs were reduced. Source: Supplied Bolger doesn't believe installing a battery will make a difference, because his solar panels won't generate enough excess energy to store \u2014 especially in winter when it's often raining and dark \u2014 to make the purchase worthwhile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My summer bills were ridiculously low. In winter, you will not generally get enough charge into the battery to make a big difference,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBattery discounts attractive for some but not others\n\nCorrigan says other households might be in a different position to Bolger, as the average NSW home only uses about 20kWh of electricity per day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW-based energy expert, who has a 1.5 kilowatt solar system, says he uses less than 10 kilowatt-hours a day, although his cooktop is powered by gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[For] most homes, a 10 kilowatt or 14 kilowatt battery will get you through the night easily,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, if you are cranking your air conditioner and you've got ducted air conditioning, it's probably only going to last you two, three hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrigan says batteries will work for some households and the new federal rebate does make the cost more affordable.\n\n\n\nA battery makes so much sense, because you can store that excess electricity you're generating in the middle of the day and then use it in the early evening.\n\nFinder has estimated the cost of a 10kWh battery could come down to between $6,713 \u2013 $8,904 due to the federal discount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Australia, the average household uses about 15 to 20kWh of electricity per day,\" a Finder spokesperson says.\n\n\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen looks at home battery systems during a visit to SolarHub in May. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch \"If most of your energy consumption is in the evening and you're paying a single electricity rate \u2014 let's use 32.34c per kWh as an average based on single-rate plans in our database \u2014 then with a 10kWh battery and using 80 per cent of its capacity, you could save about $850 a year,\" a Finder spokesperson says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, the actual savings can vary depending on the type of electricity plan you have, the rates you pay, your solar panel setup, your energy consumption patterns, and how much electricity you export back to the grid.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the federal battery discount applies nationally, the states and territories also have programs that can be used to further reduce the cost.\n\n\n\nLook at other options first\n\nCorrigan recommends considering other options before investing in expensive solar panels and battery systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe suggests Bolger should review his insulation and energy efficiency measures to reduce his electricity consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing he recommends for households is to analyse their power bills and shop around to get the best deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking your house more energy-efficient should be the next priority before considering solar panels and, finally, batteries.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your home more comfortable, get your insulation sorted and do your draft proofing. That's your best return on investment. That's your best bang for buck.\n\nCorrigan says simple changes such as installing heavy-lined curtains and a box pelmet (which goes around the top of the curtain) can be very effective at keeping your home warm, and are much cheaper than double-glazed windows, for example.\n\n\n\nHeavy curtains with a pelmet can be very effective in keeping your home warm. Source: Getty / Penpak Ngamsathain Using a thermal camera around the home can also show gaps in roof insulation where batteries might have been moved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You only need a 5 per cent gap in that insulation blanket, and the effectiveness of that insulation \u2014 the whole blanket \u2014 diminishes by almost a half,\" Corrigan says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you get into bed tonight and you pull the doona up, just cut some holes in it, see how well it works.\"\n\n\n\nCan you afford it?\n\nWhen considering whether to invest in a battery system, Corrigan says the first consideration is cost, as they are expensive and many people don't have the money sitting in the bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who already have a solar system should check whether their inverter is battery-compatible, as this could also raise warranty issues if it needs to be replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother consideration is what your next car will be.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australians are buying EVs even if they can't charge the cars at home\n\nCorrigan says in one to two years, electric vehicles will be capable of vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid functionality, allowing EV batteries to be used to power your home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people are already doing it,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are an attractive option because EV batteries generally have a huge capacity of around 50-70kWh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could run your home for days on it.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This year, OPEC has been gradually bringing back some of the 6 million barrels a day of production it has held back over the past three years, but there is still a lot of spare capacity on the sidelines in a market that the International Agency says is already over-suppled, with the growth rate in supply about twice that of the growth in demand. Of far greater concern than Iran\u2019s own production is that of the other Middle Eastern producers. Iran has the potential, if it chose to, to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only marine entry point to the Persian Gulf and arguably the most important choke point in the global energy supply chain. Nearly a third of the world\u2019s oil transits through the strait each day and about 20 per cent of its LNG. If that trade were closed, or heavily disrupted, oil prices would soar, with estimates that they would reach somewhere between $US120 and $US150 a barrel. US President Donald Trump\u2019s misguided trade wars have left the global economy vulnerable. Credit: Bloomberg Traders are clearly discounting that possibility, partly because it would deprive Iran itself of its major source of revenue and upset its major customers but, more particularly, because it would almost certainly drag the US, whose Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, directly into the conflict.\n\nIran has, in the past, threatened to block the strait but, apart from laying some mines during the 1980s war with Iraq, hasn\u2019t done so. Loading As long as Israel refrains from attacking its oil exports and the US remains only indirectly involved (by supporting Israel defence against Iran\u2019s retaliatory strikes), the arguments for keeping the strait open would be stronger than the temptation to close it. If that were to change it would be grim news for the rest of the world. Indeed, even the so far relatively modest impact on oil prices isn\u2019t helpful. Last week \u2013 before the conflict began \u2013 the World Bank cut its forecast for global growth this year from 2.8 per cent last year to 2.3 per cent. Other economic agencies and forecasters have similarly downgraded the outlook to levels that, apart from the pandemic, were last seen in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008-09.\n\nThat\u2019s because Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are expected to severely depress global economic growth, and growth within the US in particular. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for US GDP growth by 90 basis points to a meagre 1.8 per cent earlier this year. The World Bank has US growth \u2013 2.8 per cent last year \u2013 halving to 1.4 per cent. Trump\u2019s trade wars have rendered what was reasonable global growth and a strong and out-performing US economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. With Trump\u2019s 10 per cent baseline tariffs on everyone already in place, the average US tariff has leapt from about 3 per cent to something in the high-teens. The 90-day pause on his more draconian \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs will end on July 9, where many of America\u2019s trading partners will face even higher rates. The tariffs will undermine US and global growth and push up US and global inflation rates.\n\nConventionally, because they would adversely impact global trade and the global economy, they would also reduce demand for oil. If Middle Eastern supply was disrupted, however, the oil price would spike and add to global inflation, increasing the threat of global stagflation, or the combination of lower growth and higher inflation. When the US released its latest inflation data for May last week, a contributing factor to the headline number of 2.3 per cent \u2013 the best result for more than four years \u2013 was that oil prices traded as low as $US60 a barrel last month. While the inflation data has yet to reflect the impact of the tariffs \u2013 US importers had front-loaded their orders to get in ahead of the tariffs and therefore their impact will be delayed and probably show up progressively in coming months \u2013 the surge in oil prices, thanks to the new outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East, will add to the US inflation rate.\n\nIt also introduces a new dimension of uncertainty for the US Federal Reserve Board, whose Open Market Committee meets this week. There is no expectation that it will cut US rates at this meeting but the prospect of a September cut \u2013 up for discussion before Israel\u2019s attack \u2013 may have receded if oil prices remain at their current levels, or rise further. Other central banks will have to grapple with the same question mark over the trajectory of oil prices and their impacts on inflation. Loading Trump\u2019s trade wars have rendered what was reasonable global growth and a strong and out-performing US economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Israel, with its strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and its attempt to destabilise the regime, has provided one that will already generate some wider economic stresses but has the potential to do considerably more damage if it doesn\u2019t remain contained.",

        "text": "Days after the meeting, Nganhurra resurfaced \u2013 not physically, but in a public statement by Norwegian company BW Offshore, which announced it had secured an agreement to acquire the vessel. \u201cGiven the limited availability of suitable FPSOs for redeployment, securing this unit places BW Offshore in a strong, competitive position,\u201d chief executive Marco Beenen said. While Nganhurra has been reborn, the question of what happens to offshore oil and gas infrastructure reaching the end of their lifespans is vexed. At an industry conference in Perth last week, delegates discussed the fate of another defunct floating production, storage and offloading facility: the decrepit and government-owned Northern Endeavour. Northern Endeavour, another former Woodside vessel, has for years been moored in the Timor Sea while it undergoes decommissioning.\n\nFour years after Woodside sold the vessel to Northern Oil and Gas Australia (NOGA) in 2015, Northern Endeavour was shut down amid safety warnings from the regulator, and NOGA collapsed just months later \u2013 forcing the government to step in. The Northern Endeavour, pictured in the Timor Sea in 2021. Credit: Boiling Cold Its decommissioning \u2013 funded by a levy on offshore oil and gas producers \u2013 demonstrates the risks of removing these giants from the ocean: in the worst-case scenario, 18,692 cubic metres of crude oil could have spilt into the Timor Sea. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources issued a tender to find a lead contractor for the next two stages of recycling the 43,000-tonne vessel. However, it was unable to find a tender that met the department\u2019s requirements or represented value for money. A spokesman for Resources Minister Madeleine King said the procurement process was ongoing.\n\nAs dozens of oil and gas facilities reach the end of their lifespan, there are growing calls for an Australian decommissioning and recycling industry to capitalise on the opportunities presented by offshore infrastructure. In 2023, King reaffirmed her support for the jobs generated by decommissioning to stay in Australia. \u201cAs industry starts investing to decommission $60 billion in offshore infrastructure, we want as much of that investment to be spent backing Australian industry and Australian jobs.\u201d Loading Australia\u2019s offshore energy operator NOPSEMA said in an information paper in January that, \u201crecent experience indicates that some titleholders do not develop appropriate or timely decommissioning plans, which has potential to increase risk to people and the environment\u201d. Unions say offshore oil and gas workers are perfectly placed to safely and responsibly undertake this work. The Maritime Union of Australia and Australian Workers Union have jointly called on government to reinvest more than $1 billion in levies collected from oil and gas producers into a fledgling recycling industry to safely and responsibly remove offshore infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s steel industry is ready and capable,\u201d said Australian Workers Union national secretary Paul Farrow. \u201cWe have workers prepared to do this job safely and efficiently, and our mills stand ready to recycle high-quality ferrous metals. Sending these materials abroad is a significant missed opportunity.\u201d Loading MUA National Secretary Paddy Crumlin said Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas infrastructure contains an estimated 3.7 million tonnes of high-quality ferrous metal, suitable for recycling into low-emissions steel. \u201cTowing the Northern Endeavour to [a third country] for dismantling is not just an absurd outsourcing of jobs \u2013 it\u2019s a 15,000-nautical-mile climate contradiction,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "A common perception is that EVs depreciate faster than petrol cars. But with advances in battery technology and growing market maturity, that view is beginning to shift.\n\nIt's expected 110,000 new EVs will be sold in 2024 by the year's end - a 'major milestone'. Source: Reddit\n\nAs electric vehicle (EV) adoption grows in Australia, long-held myths around battery life, resale value, and long-term costs are being increasingly challenged by real-world data. But despite progress, some misconceptions \u2014 particularly around second-hand EVs \u2014 continue to influence buyer behaviour.\n\nOne of the most persistent beliefs is that EVs don't hold their value as well as petrol-powered cars. While there's evidence that this is starting to shift, especially with improvements in battery technology, consumer hesitation remains.\n\nScott Maynard, managing director of EV brand Polestar Australia, acknowledges that concerns around battery health have historically been a major sticking point. He says that\u2019s changing, particularly when buyers go through manufacturer-certified channels.\n\n\"Purchasing a used EV through a certified manufacturer network now includes a detailed battery 'report card,' which helps build trust and gives buyers the confidence to go ahead with a second-hand electric vehicle,\" Maynard told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nWA recently launched its impressive 'EV highway', spanning 70000 kilometres across the state. Source: WA Government/ Getty\n\nEletcric vehicle batteries improving\n\nMaynard has a vested interest in promoting the second-hand market. But many of his points are supported by independent data. Battery health software provider Geotab reports that the average annual degradation rate for EV batteries has dropped from 2.3 per cent in 2019 to 1.8 per cent in 2024 \u2014 a relatively modest figure compared to early concerns.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaynard also points to advances in battery management systems that help protect long-term performance by regulating temperature and usage patterns. He argues that this technology, along with the ability to repair individual battery modules rather than replacing entire packs, is helping shift buyer perceptions.\n\nHowever, public scepticism \u2014 often amplified by social media anecdotes \u2014 still plays a role in dampening confidence. And while some consumers are now embracing the used EV market as a more affordable entry point, challenges remain around financing, insurance, and rural infrastructure.\n\nMaynard believes these barriers can be addressed through stronger industry collaboration. \"What the EV industry needs to do is engage the insurance sector on battery technology and repairability,\" he said, suggesting this could eventually result in more favourable premiums for consumers.\n\nEV charging ports are increasing in numbers across the country. Source: Supplied\n\nCharging infrastructure is broading across Australia\n\nWhen it comes to running costs, he also argues that EVs are proving cheaper to own and maintain than many Australians expect \u2014 especially for households with access to home charging and rooftop solar. Still, access to these cost-saving advantages isn't evenly distributed, particularly in regional areas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRange anxiety continues to be a major concern, and while Australia now has more than 1,800 high-power charging locations, infrastructure reliability and coverage remain key issues. Maynard says more test drives and exposure to EVs are crucial in breaking down remaining hesitations.\n\n\"Education is crucial. Once you\u2019ve experienced the convenience of home charging and the smooth, quiet performance of an EV, it\u2019s hard to go back,\" he said.\n\n\"That\u2019s before you consider the environmental and health benefits of making the switch. It\u2019s crucial that we continue fighting misinformation around EVs and educating Australians about these benefits.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
