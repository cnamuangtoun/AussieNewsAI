It cited earlier attacks against Chinese in Japan and what it called Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's \"erroneous remarks\" on Taiwan, which it said undermined the atmosphere for China-Japan exchange.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, right, shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi when they met on the sidelines of an APEC summit in South Korea on October 31, 2025.

(Supplied)\n\n\"Now I'm getting this demand for permanent work,\" Shah told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"I think the culture is moving in that direction \u2013 everyone's got so many tattoos now, and piercings, the permanent gold teeth and diamond teeth is probably the next phase.\"\n\nBorn in Nairobi and raised in the suburbs of Perth, Shah decided to pursue dentistry after hearing that a schoolmate's dentist dad only had to work three days a week.\n\nHe went in blind and admitted he didn't have much \"natural talent\". \ufeff\n\nBut he persevered and completed his degree in 2015.\n\nThe idea for Dr Grillz\ufeff struck him just a few weeks later, when he went to see his favourite DJs perform.\n\n\"I won some backstage passes, so I met them before their show and they had grillz in,\" Shah said.\n\nThese are grillz, removable dental accessories often made from gold and diamonds. (Supplied)\n\nWhen he asked about the accessories, the DJs confessed they travelled abroad to buy them because grillz were so hard to find in Australia.\n\nShah immediately saw it as an opportunity.\n\nAfter the show, his mates wanted grillz of their own, so he connected with designers and jewellers to create them.\n\nIt became a hobby, one he shared online via his Dr Grillz Instagram page.\n\nMost of the dentists he worked with called it a \"gimmick\", insisting it wouldn't amount to anything.\n\nBut Shah's social media page had started to gain traction.\n\nBefore long, total strangers were reaching out to order custom grillz.\n\nStill working full-time as a dentist, Shah slowly built a team of designers, jewellers and technicians to help bring each set of custom grillz to life.\n\nShah has built a team of jewellers, designers and technicians who keep Dr Grillz going. (Supplied)\n\nHe did most of the work for Dr Grillz between appointments or on weekends, but Shah didn't mind dedicating that time to a creative outlet.\n\nAnd at up to $5000 a pop, grillz were becoming a lucrative little side hustle.\n\n\"A little silver tooth would maybe be $200 or $300, and if you wanted a little tooth gem that's somewhere between $30 and $50,\" Shah explained.\n\n\"But then, when the pieces start to get bigger, covering multiple teeth, then it'll move to that $500 to $1000 mark.\n\n\"And then when you add diamonds, or if they're very big pieces, it goes into the thousands \u2013 up to $5000.\"\n\nHe charges even more for permanent work, though it's not something he does often.\n\n\ufeffOn one occasion, Shah created a custom gold and diamond implant worth several thousand dollars to replace a patient's missing tooth.\n\nThis gold and diamond permanent tooth implant was created to fill the place where a client was missing a tooth. (Supplied)\n\nBut he's reluctant to do anything permanent that could damage a patient's natural smile \u2013 even though he could charge tens of thousands for it.\n\n\ufeff\"I'm still a dentist, my job is to protect your teeth,\" Shah said.\n\nDr Grillz is now a six-figure business and Shah will soon be opening a grillz studio in the Perth suburb of Northbridge.\n\nGetting to this point hasn't been easy but the challenges he's faced building this side hustle are nothing compared to his day job.\n\n\"The mishaps you have in dentistry, the complications and pain and bleeding, is a way worse headache than grillz ever will be,\" he said.\n\n\ufeffAt least his Dr Grillz clients are happy to see him \u2013 unlike many of the patients he sees working full-time across two private dentistry practices.\n\n\ufeff\"When you work as a dentist, no one's really that excited to see you,\" Shah laughed.\n\nAustralian musician Mia Rodriguez shows off a custom set of grillz from Dr Grillz. (Supplied)\n\nBut he never considered giving up work as a dentist to focus on Dr Grillz alone.\n\nAbout 55 per cent of Australians are currently earning money from a side hustle, or actively considering starting one, according to Westpac data.\n\nLike many of them, \ufeffShah has had to play it smart with his money to keep his business going.\n\nWithout his salary as a dentist to fall back on, he doubts Dr Grillz would be as successful as it is today \u2013 if at all.\n\n\ufeffHe urged other Aussies looking to build a brand or make cash on the side not to dive into a side hustle without considering how they'll pay rent when business is slow.\n\nShah encouraged other Aussies pursuing side hustles to keep their day jobs and focus on making smart money decisions. (Supplied)\n\nBecause there's nothing \ufeffthat can kill a small business quicker than poor financial planning.\n\n\"If you can have a job that pays your bills and things like that, then all the money your side hustle makes, you can reinvest into the business,\" he said.\n\n\"And even if that business doesn't grow into something that makes you $1 million, it will lead you into that next thing that might be the golden ticket for you.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

(ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nUnder the ACT's Work Health and Safety Act (2011), all asbestos removal work is required to be carried out by a licensed asbestos removalist.\n\n\"We need to have a certified asbestos assessor and contractor remove the contaminated sand and then provide a certificate to our schools that they are safe to return,\" Ms Berry said.\n\nJo Wood says the directorate is taking every step to \"prioritise safety\". (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nACT Education Directorate director-general Jo Wood said the directorate was responsible for the safety of staff and students according to \"very stringent work health and safety laws\".\n\n\"We are doing everything we can to be following every single step under our legislation, and ensuring we're doing that in a really risk-assured way,\" Ms Wood said.\n\n\"So I guess what I would say is people can have confidence that we're really considering the risk and really taking every step to prioritise safety.\"\n\nWhy are Catholic and independent schools open?\n\nAll employers within the ACT operate under the same legislation, including Catholic and independent schools.\n\nTracy Taylor, the executive director of Independent Schools ACT, said they had searched every school for the products and were \"confident\" they had acted appropriately.\n\n\"Out of our 18 schools, 11 of them confirmed they did not have any of the sand products on site,\" Ms Taylor said.\n\n\"Seven of them found some small samples on site and they all did the right thing and got the licensed asbestos assessors in who disposed of any of the suspected contaminated products.\"\n\nCatholic Education issued a statement this morning saying it was working closely with the Education Directorate and health and safety authorities.\n\n\"We believe we have contained all the affected sand and the risk in our schools is still low,\" the statement said.\n\nWhy are schools open in other states and territories?\n\nThe ACT Education Directorate is alone in its decision to close schools, other than one independent school in Brisbane and another in Tasmania.\n\nSince the products were recalled, officials and experts have said any asbestos found in the coloured sand posed a low health risk.\n\n\n\n\"It's two things: it's probably unlikely to become airborne, and the second is it's really a very short-term exposure,\" Professor Martyn Kirk from the ANU's National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health said.\n\n\"What we are worried about is when they breathe it in, not if they consume it.\n\n\"It's very unlikely in something like sand that you're going to get much in the air.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Giant Steps Tasmania in Deloraine said the closure would allow staff to safely remove the product, deep clean classrooms and seek further advice from specialists.\n\nMore coloured sand products recalled Kmart has recalled four coloured sand products over concerns of asbestos contamination.\n\nIn South Australia, 139 sites have now been found to have the coloured sand, with independent contractors coming in to clean surfaces where the product has been loose.\n\nIn Western Australia, residents were urged to take precautions, including storing the products in sealed containers in a secure location. The government's advice said not to dispose of the product but await further instruction.\n\nThe Queensland government has questioned how the Chinese-made products were allowed into the country.\n\n\"It's important that people are given up-to-date information and also that there is a proper analysis on how this was imported and distributed,\" Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said.\n\nVictoria is undertaking an investigation with the importer and supplier of the sand products.\n\nNo NSW public schools have been closed.\n\nAs a precaution, a safety alert has been sent to all NSW public schools to immediately and safely remove the sand products, if present.\n\n\"The health, safety, and wellbeing of students, staff, and the school community is the department's highest priority,\" A NSW Department of Education spokesperson said.",

        "text": "China's rules for imported seafood are among the reasons for a snap partial closure of Tasmania's rock lobster fishery, in an area where salmon farms are using the antibiotic florfenicol.\n\nJust hours after the commercial rock lobster season opened on Friday, the Natural Resources and Environment Department (NRE) closed two sections of the fishery south of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel in the state's south-east \"until further notice\".\n\n\"The [areas] were closed because they are within the 3-kilometre radius of where florfenicol has been used within the salmon pens,\" said Jane McGowan from the Tasmanian Rock Lobster Council.\n\n\" The decision to close is not because of florfenicol as a risk to human consumption, it's more under an abundance of caution to do with market access for our export markets. \"\n\nDifferent export markets have different rules. NRE's marine resources general manager, Dr David Midson, said the state's largest export market for lobster, China, had a requirement that there were no traces of antibiotics present in imported rock lobster.\n\nSalmon companies have received approval to use the antibiotic florfenicol. (Supplied: Tassal)\n\nLoading...\n\nPremier Jeremy Rockliff said the export market for rock lobster was \"a very, very sensitive market\".\n\n\"All primary producers, whether it be cherries or whether it be beef or whatever the case may be, have to be extra vigilant \u2026 and sensitive to the markets,\" Mr Rockliff told a budget estimates committee on Monday.\n\nHe said the closure was \"that extra precaution, if you like\".\n\nTasmania's farmed salmon industry received federal approval this month for the emergency use of the antibiotic florfenicol in its pens, following a mass mortality event last summer.\n\nThe state's Health Department has advised there are \"no reports of adverse human health effects from exposure to traces of florfenicol in meat or fish\".\n\nPublic health director Dr Mark Veitch has said that anyone who wants to avoid exposure to antibiotic residue should consider not consuming fish caught within 3 kilometres of a salmon pen being treated with florfenicol.\n\nThe state government has a live map showing where florfenicol is being used.\n\nClosure a 'smart move'\n\nBryce Way says he supports the closure of the two zones. (Supplied: Bryce Way)\n\nCommercial rock lobster fisher Bryce Way told ABC Radio Mornings closing the two zones was \"a smart move\" by NRE.\n\n\"It's important that everything we do meets our export rules and regulations,\" Mr Way said.\n\nBut he said the closure would have consequences.\n\n\"We've lost a large area that can't be fished \u2026 a nearly 6 square mile [15.5 square kilometre] area,\" he said.\n\n\"Which puts more fishing effort in a small area nearby.\"\n\nDr Midson told ABC Radio Mornings he expected the areas would be reopened to fishing within \"weeks\".\n\n\"The vast majority of the commercial rock lobster fishery is currently open, but that's not to downplay the impact, particularly on some fishers,\" he said.\n\n'Not something we're trying to hide'\n\nThe notice that NRE issued advising of the closure did not mention the reason for it.\n\nDr Midson said that was because the notice was a \"legal instrument\" that contained the information that was legally required.\n\n\"It's not something that we're trying to hide,\" he said.\n\nThere are concerns the closure will put more pressure on nearby areas. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nCommercial rock lobster fishers were also sent an email from NRE, which Mr Way said included more information.\n\nMr Way said he would like to see more warning of antibiotic use.\n\n\"The season opened on the 14th [of November] at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and we got an email at about 6:15 in the evening saying that as of that night, once you pull your gear, don't shoot them back into the water,\" he said.\n\n\"No one should have an issue with the zones closing for us commercially, the issue is the lack of discussion to the local commercial and recreational people that this could impact \u2014 there's no way the farms decided a few days ago to do this.\"",

        "text": "\"Never had such a picture moved and disturbed the Australian public.\"\n\nThat's art historian Patrick McCaughey, speaking at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) about what is arguably the most controversial artwork in modern Australian history.\n\nThe painting was Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles, and some people believe it played a part in Gough Whitlam's dramatic dismissal from government in 1975.\n\nThe abstract expressionist painting was purchased for $1.3 million (approximately $11.3 million today) by the Australian federal government to take pride of place in Canberra's yet-to-be-built Australian National Gallery (which would later become the NGA).\n\nIt was the highest figure ever paid for an American artwork at the time, and led to furious public debate about government spending and the value of art. Ultimately, it became a political weapon for the opposition, who would later block supply of the Whitlam government's budget.\n\nBut this was not the first time the Australian public had been gripped with controversy over an artwork, nor would it be the last.\n\nThe one about style\n\nThere wasn't much that could push World War II off the front pages in 1943, but one portrait was so controversial that it did just that.\n\nIn fact, the painting in question was described at the time by artist Mary Edwards as a \"Pearl Harbor attack on art\".\n\n\" Not a child or an expectant mother should be allowed in the Art Gallery at present. \"\n\nSo, what was this artwork that provoked so much furore? It was Portrait of an Artist (Joshua Smith) by Sir William Dobell.\n\nThe Archibald Prize was less than two decades old, and Dobell had already entered three times. In 1943, he decided to paint a portrait of his fellow artist, Joshua Smith.\n\nThe portrait was awarded the top prize, with the Contemporary Art Society declaring it the most important work of art entered in the competition. The portrait was hung proudly in the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\n\nBut not everybody was happy.\n\nDobell used the title Portrait of an Artist for his painting but it was listed in the catalogue of the 1943 Archibald Prize competition as Mr Joshua Smith. ( )\n\nSmith's parents were seemingly horrified by the portrayal of their son. Despite Smith originally telling Dobell he quite liked the piece, his parents apparently pleaded with the artist to withdraw the \"humiliating\" portrait from the prize, and even offered to buy it.\n\nMelbourne newspaper critic James Stuart MacDonald, who had been director of the National Art Gallery of NSW, described the portrait as the \"epitome of ugliness, malformation and gruesome taste\".\n\n\"Mr Joshua Smith looks like a man naturally deformed or crippled, and suffering, in addition, from malnutrition,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nArt historian Lorraine Kypriotis explained to ABC Nightlife that Dobell had \"an expressionistic style\" where he distorted the human body.\n\n\" Sometimes they'd be long and thin. Other times they'd be quite bulky. But you always got a sense of the character's true personality coming through in his works, like I think all great portrait artists. \"\n\nMacquarie University historian Dr Peter Edwell, who wrote a book about the controversy, says many people just thought the exaggerated style of the piece was ugly.\n\n\"What made the win controversial was that Dobell's painting was different to past winners and it was linked to the influences of modernism and caricature,\" Dr Edwell told The Lighthouse.\n\n\"There was also the belief that Smith was rendered in a way that suggested he was gay at a time when homosexuality was against the law.\"\n\nAfter the piece was announced as the winner, groups of \"concerned citizens\" met in Sydney and Melbourne, aiming to challenge the decision.\n\nEdwards and fellow Sydney artist Joseph Wolinski decided to take the matter to the courts.\n\nThey argued the work was not a true portrait, as it depicted Smith in a \"distorted and caricatured form\". They believed the prize money should be withheld, as it was contrary to the terms set out in J.F Archibald's will.\n\nLoading...\n\nA bizarre court case ensued, where lawyers debated and scrutinised the meaning of art. To add to their claim, Dr Vivian Benjafield was called to the stand to attest that a living, healthy person couldn't look the way Smith was represented.\n\n\"I would say that it represents the body of a man who had died in that position and had remained in that position for a period of some months and had dried up.\"\n\nIn the end, the Honourable Justice Ernest Roper dismissed the case, saying: \"The picture in question is characterised by some startling exaggeration and distortion ... It bears, nevertheless, a strong degree of likeness to the subject and is, I think, undoubtedly a pictorial representation of him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, record numbers of people visited the gallery to check out the controversial painting; the gallery extended its opening hours and prolonged the exhibition by a month.\n\nSmith is said to have never quite recovered from the humiliation of the ordeal. When he won the Archibald Prize for his portrait of John Solomon Rosevear the following year, many speculated that it was a consolation prize.\n\nDobell won the Archibald Prize again in 1948 for his portrait of Margaret Olley, and in 1959 for his portrait of Dr EG MacMahon.\n\nThe painting of Smith was all but destroyed in a fire in 1958, and subsequently restored.\n\nThe one about obscenity\n\nA Sydney artist identifying as a bisexual witch might not draw a second glance these days, but in the 1940s it wasn't so common.\n\nRosaleen Norton emigrated to Sydney from Dunedin in 1925, and went on to become a trailblazing, and often misunderstood, artist.\n\nA self-proclaimed witch, Norton experienced childhood visions. From around the age of 23, she practised trance magic and, later, sex magic, in various flats and squats in inner-city Sydney.\n\nTrance magic involved Norton meditating (sometimes with the assistance of various substances) and raising her consciousness, aiming to experience higher forms of existence.\n\nSex magic was developed by the infamous English occultist, Aleister Crowley, around 1904, and involves a complicated series of sexual rituals designed to induce spiritual awakening.\n\nSafe to say, the predominantly Christian Australian culture of the time was alarmed by the art Norton produced and exhibited.\n\nFirebird by Rosaleen Norton. ( ) Norton photographed with her cat in 1949. ( ) Rosaleen Norton's Bacchanal. ( )\n\nThe tabloid presses frequently derided the \"satanic\" work of the \"Witch of King's Cross\", saying it was obscene and encouraged devil worship. (Although Norton seemed to lean into this label, sometimes wearing a pointed witch's hat). She was also the subject of regular police surveillance.\n\nDuring an exhibition of her art at Rowden-White Library, University of Melbourne, in 1949, the Vice Squad seized several works deemed to be profane. Norton appeared in court on obscenity charges \u2014 the first such case against a woman in Victoria.\n\nShe was acquitted, but a later book of her art landed the printer in court on charges of producing an obscene publication, and the book was banned.\n\nNorton retired from public view in the 1970s and died of colon cancer in 1979. Her extraordinary life and the influence of her art were captured in a 2020 documentary, The Witch of King's Cross on Prime Video.\n\nThe one about government spending\n\nJames Mollison is \"one of the most important Australian cultural figures\", according to journalist and writer Tom McIlroy, but very few people have heard of him.\n\nMollison was a public servant, a gallery executive and an arts leader in Australia. And he was the man tasked by the Whitlam Government with putting together a world-class sample of art for a new national gallery in Australia, which had been delayed for years.\n\nMollison's mission was part of a slew of commitments from Whitlam's government that he claimed would \"refresh, reinvigorate and liberate Australian intellectual and cultural life\".\n\nLoading...\n\nCompelled to bring something different to the collection, Mollison started talking with art dealers in New York.\n\n\"I think from the very start he sees the potential to really shake things up and catch people unaware with something like a Jackson Pollock painting, to hang next to Renaissance artworks, French impressionism, great sculpture from centuries past,\" says McIlroy, who also wrote Blue Poles: Jackson Pollock, Gough Whitlam and the Painting that Changed a Nation.\n\n\"He wanted to make a statement, and I think he achieved that.\"\n\nComing in at a sale price of $1.3 million, the enormous painting was worth about a fifth of their total acquisition budget and had to be approved by the prime minister himself. Going against political advice, Whitlam decided that the price paid for the artwork should be made public.\n\n\"I think he knew from the very start that this was going to be a transformational purchase; I think he knew that it was something that would forever be associated with him and with his government,\" says McIlroy.\n\n\"From the very start, Whitlam spoke about the importance of the arts. He said that to be a civilised society in the modern world, governments needed to foster the arts.\"\n\nAnd so, a political ruckus was ignited.\n\nIn 2016 Blue Poles was estimated to be worth $350 million, which means it has increased in value more than 30-fold. ( )\n\n'$1.3m for dribs and drabs,' raged one newspaper headline.\n\n'Barefoot drunks painted our $1 million masterpiece', read another.\n\nMembers of Whitlam's own party publicly criticised spending government money on paintings that were \"weird\". James Mollison was dragged in front of the Senate for questioning.\n\nThe purchase came at a time of economic difficulty for many people, and the opposition seized the moment, linking the painting to criticism about the government's handling of the budget.\n\n\"It became a political weapon against the Whitlam government,\" says McIlroy.\n\n\"It gives people like Malcolm Fraser and a whole host of coalition MPs the opportunity to say their priorities are warped. We can do a better job in governing Australia.\n\n\" And I think it plays a small piece in the ultimate drama of the Whitlam government playing out a couple of years later in the dismissal. \"\n\nThe inside story of how Gough Whitlam's dismissal changed Australian democracy forever Gough Whitlam's dismissal began with a budget stand-off. This is the inside story of the political earthquake that changed Australian democracy forever.\n\nGough Whitlam was dismissed by governor-general Sir John Kerr in 1975, 50 years ago. But he remained staunch in his support of the work throughout his life \u2014 he and his wife put Blue Poles on their annual Christmas card for years, even after he left government.\n\nBlue Poles is now the most viewed artwork at the National Gallery of Australia. The gallery has only lent the painting to other institutions twice (to MoMA in 1998\u201399 and the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 2016).\n\nIn 2016, Blue Poles was estimated to be worth $350 million.\n\nThe one about exploitation\n\nIn May 2008, police descended on a gallery in Paddington, Sydney, and seized 20 photographs.\n\nThey were the work of renowned Australian photographer Bill Henson.\n\nThe art in question was a series of photographs of a naked 13-year-old girl, and followed complaints from child protection organisation Bravehearts.\n\nThe website of Roslyn Oxley9 gallery was also referred to the Child Protection Internet Unit and the matter was also referred to the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal public debate about art, consent, children and nudity.\n\nPolice spoke to the model and her family. ( )\n\nThe gallery received numerous threats and then prime minister Kevin Rudd labelled the work \"absolutely revolting\".\n\n\"Whatever the artistic view of the merits of that sort of stuff \u2014 frankly I don't think there are any \u2014 just allow kids to be kids.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the artistic community rallied behind Henson, with everyone from Cate Blanchett to author JM Coetzee signing an open letter of support.\n\n\"The work itself is not pornographic, even though it includes depictions of naked human beings,\" stated the letter.\n\n\"It is more justly seen in a tradition of the nude in art that stretches back to the ancient Greeks, and which includes painters such as Caravaggio and Michelangelo.\"\n\nEventually, the Australian Federal Police said they found Henson's work did not breach the law.\n\nThe artist welcomed the findings in a statement.\n\nBill Henson has been working as a photographer in Melbourne for more than 40 years. ( )\n\n\"It has been profoundly humbling to witness the depth of support for my work in these past weeks,\" Henson said.\n\n\"It is reassuring to see existing laws, having been rigorously tested, still provide a framework in which debate and expression of ideas can occur.\"\n\nBut high-profile anti-child abuse campaigner Hetty Johnston, from the Bravehearts group, said it was a dark day.\n\n\"This is a big green light for the commercial sexual exploitation of our children,\" she said.\n\n\"That we can't prosecute that in this country is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nThen-NSW Law Society president Hugh Macken said the decision established a simple fact: that nudity is not obscenity.\n\n\"Bill Henson is one of most eminent photographers. He is a man worthy of accolades, not persecution,\" he said.\n\nHenson was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2024 for his service to the visual arts and the promotion of Australian culture.\n\nThe one about financial influence\n\n\"I paint the world as I see it.\"\n\nThis was the simple but impactful statement made by artist Vincent Namatjira in May 2024.\n\nThe work of the Archibald Prize-winning artist was suddenly under an enormous global spotlight, after a reported request to have one of his portraits removed from the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nThe portrait in question was of Australia's richest woman, mining magnate Gina Rinehart.\n\nThe portrait of Gina Rinehart by Vincent Namatjira is done in the Western Aranda artist\u2019s bold style. ( )\n\nIt was part of an exhibit by Namatjira titled Australia in colour, and featured Rinehart alongside prominent figures such as Cathy Freeman, Adam Goodes, Scott Morrison, Julia Gillard, King Charles and many more.\n\nTo make matters more confusing, Swimming Queensland contacted the gallery directly, asking them to consider taking it down.\n\nRinehart's mining company, Hancock Prospecting, spends a great deal of money sponsoring Australian athletes: more than a quarter of Australia's 2024 Olympic team were directly supported by Rinehart.\n\nAnd apparently some of the swimmers didn't like the way the portrait portrayed their benefactor.\n\n\"We confirmed that a significant number of swimmers felt that way,\" said Swimming Queensland chief executive Kevin Hasemann.\n\n\"And having seen the portrait myself, it made sense that we would respectfully \u2014 and I emphasise respectfully \u2014 contact the gallery, make them aware of the way that we were perceiving it and hope that they might consider taking it down.\"\n\nThe monograph, titled Australia in Colour, is a collection of paintings of powerful people, said Namatjira. ( )\n\nThe National Gallery simply said that it welcomes public dialogue about its works.\n\nBut the National Association of Visual Arts says any pressure to remove a portrait that somebody doesn't like \"sets a dangerous precedent for censorship and the stifling of creative expression\".\n\nFor Namatjira, it's simple:\n\n\"People don't have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, 'why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?'\"\n\nThe one about political influence\n\nKhaled Sabsabi was shocked when he found out he had been selected to represent Australia in the 61st Venice Biennale Art Exhibition.\n\nThe prestigious annual event is often dubbed \"the Olympics of the arts world\", with countries selecting artists to represent them in a national pavilion.\n\nIn 2024, Australia's pavilion won for the first time in the prize's history, with the monumental installation kith and kin, by First Nations artist Archie Moore.\n\nSabsabi and longtime collaborator, curator Michael Dagostino, had missed out on the position three times before.\n\nLebanese-Australian Western Sydney artist Khaled Sabsabi began his creative life as a hip-hop performer. ( )\n\n\"There was a sense of joy, an extreme sense of joy, disbelief, shock, to be accepted in that context \u2014 as a migrant \u2026 as a Muslim,\" the Lebanese-Australian artist told ABC Radio National's The Art Show.\n\n\"It spoke to all the good things of what Australia stands for, and the values that we stand for.\n\n\"To have that taken away from you is heartbreaking.\"\n\nDays after the announcement, Creative Australia's decision to appoint the duo was questioned in The Australian newspaper, which pointed out two much older artworks of Sabsabi's that it found problematic, particularly in the light of conflict in the Middle East.\n\nSabsabi's video Thank You Very Much includes footage of the hijacked second plane crashing into New York's Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. It's coupled with vision of then-US president George W Bush thanking first responders in the days immediately following the attacks, before he launched the war on terror in retaliation.\n\nYOU (2007) was a multichannel video and sound installation, which was first shown in Khaled Sabsabi's solo exhibition at Campbelltown Art Centre in 2007 as a two-part installation. ( )\n\nYOU, a multi-channel video and sound installation first exhibited in 2007, features Hassan Nasrallah, the former leader of the Lebanese political party and militant group Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli air-strike in 2024.\n\nHezbollah was not listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the Australian government until 2021.\n\nAfter the article was published, the matter was raised in Question Time in the Senate by the federal opposition's arts spokesperson, Claire Chandler, who accused Labor of using taxpayer funds to showcase an artist who had \"repeatedly depicted terrorists and terrorist acts\".\n\nThings moved quickly then. Arts Minister Tony Burke called Creative Australia with questions, and an extraordinary board meeting was called. It was decided that the invitation to Sabsabi and Dagostino would be rescinded.\n\nStream Portrait Artist of the Year on ABC iview This captivating eight-part art competition series explores one of the most accessible and provocative forms of art \u2014 the portrait.\n\nThe Creative Australia board faced fierce criticism from the Australian arts community, who called into question the organisation's stated principles of arms-length funding.\n\nTwo key players in Australia's Venice participation, Creative Australia's head of visual arts, Mikala Tai, and project manager Tahmina Maskinyar resigned.\n\nThe only visual artist on the board, Lindy Lee, also quit.\n\nThe other artists shortlisted to appear at the Venice Biennale, including Hayley Millar Baker and James Nguyen, were quick to demand Sabsabi's reinstatement.\n\nAlmost six months after the snap decision, after an internal review, Khaled Sabsabi and Michael Dagostino were reinstated to represent Australia in 2026.\n\nThe pair welcomed the decision, describing the work planned for the Venice Biennale as \"inclusive\" and \"nurturing\", saying it was intended to \"bring people together\".\n\n\"The world is becoming much more polarised at the moment,\" Dagostino told ABC Arts. \"With this polarisation, there's a lack of understanding about other people's experience and a lack of empathy.\n\n\"Hopefully this work can bring people together that might have different viewpoints, but who will come together to have this experience where they're trying to understand the other person's position.\"\n\nWatch the new season of Portrait Artist of the Year free on ABC TV and ABC iview.",

        "text": "Another AFL draft has arrived, offering dozens of teenage footballers the chance to realise their dreams and clubs the opportunity to prepare for a brighter future.\n\nThe draft can be a complicated beast these days, with academies and father-son selections muddying the waters for clubs looking to secure the best talent.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the 2025 AFL draft.\n\nWhen is the AFL draft?\n\nThe 2025 AFL draft will be held over two nights on November 19 and November 20.\n\nThe first round will be completed on the first night, when a selection of players will be present at Docklands Stadium for the event.\n\nThe rest of the draft will be held on the second night. In total, 50 to 60 players are expected to be drafted this year.\n\nHow can I follow the AFL draft?\n\nABC Sport will have live blogs running on both nights of the draft, bringing you news and analysis of every pick.\n\nThe draft will also be broadcast live on Fox Footy and Kayo Sports.\n\nWhat time is the AFL draft?\n\nBoth nights of the draft will start at 7pm AEDT.\n\nHere are the corresponding times for other regions of Australia.\n\n6:30pm ACDT: South Australia\n\nSouth Australia 6pm AEST: Queensland\n\nQueensland 5:30pm ACST : Northern Territory\n\n: Northern Territory 4pm AWST: Western Australia\n\nWho are the players I should know before the draft?\n\nIt is widely expected that Willem Duursma \u2014 the fourth Duursma sibling to join the AFL/AFLW system \u2014 will be taken by West Coast with the first selection on Wednesday night.\n\nWillem Duursma is set to be the number one pick at this year's draft. (Getty Images: Paul Kane)\n\nOthers in the top-five mix are Zeke Uwland and Dylan Patterson (both members of Gold Coast's academy), Daniel Annable (a member of Brisbane's academy) and Harry Dean (a Carlton father-son).\n\nFrom the open pool of players available to all, Cooper Duff-Tytler, Sullivan Robey, Xavier Taylor, Sam Cumming and Dyson Sharp are the strongest top-10 candidates.\n\nWhat is the current order of picks in the first round?\n\nWest Coast West Coast Richmond Richmond Essendon Essendon Melbourne Melbourne Carlton Hawthorn Carlton GWS West Coast Western Bulldogs Gold Coast Adelaide Brisbane Gold Coast Geelong Fremantle Essendon Hawthorn Brisbane\n\nHow does the bidding system work in the AFL draft?\n\nThe AFL assigns each draft pick with a points value. The first pick in the draft has the most value, with 3,000 points, and the points value of each pick decreases all the way down until pick 54, the final pick of the third round, which is worth 14 points. Any picks from then onwards have no points value.\n\nBrisbane will swiftly match a bid for academy prospect Daniel Annable. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nThe points system is in place for two reasons: to require clubs to pay for matching bids on father-son prospects or academy prospects that are tipped to go high up in any given draft year.\n\nTeams who match bids for either a father-son or academy prospect get a 20 per cent discount. Teams are not obligated to match bids from other clubs, therefore allowing the player to be drafted by a different club.\n\nCan teams do trades during the draft?\n\nThey sure can!\n\nSince being introduced in 2018, the ability for teams to trade during the draft has added an extra wrinkle to the whole process.\n\nTeams can trade with each other using their own picks in the current draft as well as using picks in the 2026 or 2027 drafts.\n\nWhat is the father-son rule?\n\nThe father-son rule is one that is unique to the AFL and allows family traditions to be carried through generations.\n\nSimply put, if a player makes 100 or more appearances for a single club, then that same club has the right to draft the player's son.\n\nThere have been some famous father-son combinations to have played in VFL/AFL history, perhaps none more famous than Gary Ablett and Gary Ablett Jr, who both played for Geelong.\n\nTeams are not obligated to select a player under the father-son rule either. A famous example of this occurred in the 2015 draft when the Sydney Swans opted against drafting Josh Dunkley \u2014 now a three-time premiership player \u2014 whose father, Andrew, played 217 games for the club.",

(Supplied)\n\nFire still at forefront of community minds\n\nEsperance shire president and volunteer firefighter Ron Chambers said some members of the community were still on edge at the first sign of smoke, 10 years on from the deadly blaze.\n\n\"It's funny when you start talking to people and just how quickly they reminisce or how they sort of say that it doesn't seem like 10 years,\" he said.\n\nRon Chambers says people still keenly remember the deadly fires. (ABC Esperance: Andrew Williams)\n\nIn the decade since the bushfires, many of the coroner's 12 recommendations have been acted upon, including the establishment of an aerial firefighting fleet based in Esperance over harvest, new fire trucks, and a phone repeater tower installed at Peak Charles.\n\nMr Chambers believes further change is required, but acknowledges there have been positive improvements in the past decade.\n\n\"We've seen an awful lot of changes in and around the requirements and equipment and those sorts of things for volunteer firefighters, and a lot of technology that's been introduced into those sorts of realms.\"\n\nDan Sanderson and Greg Curnow say more money needs to be spent on bushfire mitigation. (ABC Esperance: Tara De Landgrafft)\n\nCascade farmer Greg Curnow lost his uncle Kym, or \"Freddy\" as he was known, in the 2015 blaze and said there was a lot left to be addressed.\n\n\"There has been some really good improvements and aspects to it, there are aspects that are quite disappointing though and still really haven't been addressed in a meaningful way,\" Mr Curnow said.\n\nMitigation still a major concern\n\nIn coroner Sarah Linton's 2019 report was a recommendation to instil a long term fire mitigation strategy for Esperance, funded over 10 years.\n\nAccording to the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES), since 2015 the state government has significantly increased its spending on bushfire mitigation on-ground works.\n\nLocal governments have been granted $9.5 million through the Mitigation Activity Fund Grants Program for on-ground works with $1.15 million of this spent within the Esperance Shire.\n\nA paddock of wheat grows at Cascade, north of Esperance. (ABC Esperance: Tara De Landgrafft)\n\nDan Sanderson, one of the farmers who spearheaded a privately funded review into the bushfires, said mitigation was key.\n\n\"When we did our review of the fire, and along with the coroner's findings from the inquest, mitigation was a big one and there are still problems with mitigation at the moment,\" Mr Sanderson said.\n\n\"I was looking at cost-effective solutions, and I've given up on the cost-effective solutions. All I want is effective solutions and that's probably been the biggest change for me in the last 10 years.\n\nFirefighters and farm response units battle an out-of-control bushfire at Grass Patch near Esperance on November 19, 2015. (Supplied: Department of Fire and Emergency Services)\n\nGreg Curnow agreed that mitigation was a priority, and said there needed to be more emphasis on local brigades carrying out the mitigation works.\n\n\"There's no 100 percenters in fire fighting, but mitigation is a 20 per cent. It's a big one,\" Mr Curnow said.\n\n\"It will be far more efficient, it will get done properly and safely, and at a fraction of the cost.\"\n\nDan Sanderson says not enough money is being spent of bushfire mitigation. (ABC Esperance: Tara De Landgrafft)\n\nWhile the agricultural community had been proactive in the decade since, Mr Curnow believed more money was needed for mitigation.\n\n\"We've invested significantly in machinery and firefighting apparatuses personally, and pretty much every business in this location does,\" Mr Curnow said.\n\n\"We had another incidence with a young man passing away two years ago, from almost the exact same sort of incident.\n\n\"These things happen \u2014 we're in a high-risk area with lots of reserves which are unmanaged, unmaintained.\n\n\"I think the risk is always going to be there, but if this continues, it isn't going to reduce without positive change.\"\n\nDan Sanderson looks at the quality of a paddock of wheat, 10 years on from the Esperance bushfires. (ABC Esperance: Tara De Landgrafft)\n\nStill waiting for legislation\n\nAnother point of contention for the Esperance community was the time it had taken for consolidated emergency services legislation to be drafted, which was another recommendation by the coroner.\n\nRon Chambers said they desperately wanted to see the detail of the bill.\n\n\"It is taking too long,\" Mr Chambers said.\n\n\"We need to get that act up so that we know what's in the act and the regulations that we'll work with.\"\n\nWheat growing at Greg Curnow's Cascade farm, a decade on from the 2015 bushfires. (ABC Esperance: Tara De Landgrafft)\n\nHowever Dan Sanderson hoped there would be enough time for regional brigades to review the act and have input before the legislation was enshrined in law.\n\n\"We need that consultation period where we can have a look at it and work at it,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm concerned now that it will get rushed through and there will be like three months. It's not gonna be long enough.\"\n\nDFES confirmed to the ABC that an Emergency Services Exposure Draft Bill was being prepared and that, once finalised, it would be released for public comment, including to regional brigades.\n\nHope for change\n\nWhile they continued to advocate for change, Dan Sanderson and Greg Curnow said they remained hopeful.\n\nGreg Curnow inspects some wheat at his property, which was impacted by the 2015 bushfires. (ABC Esperance: Tara De Landgrafft)\n\n\"Things have got a lot better responding to fires than what we went through in 2015,\" Mr Sanderson said.\n\n\" It's giving faith for the future, of being able to respond to fires better, and have less life-threatening instances. \"\n\nMr Curnow said while the improvements made in Esperance had not been replicated across the state, the local community had benefited from the change.\n\n\"I think we're in a hell of a lot better place than we were 10 years ago,\" he said.",

        "text": "Brisbane bus passengers have shaved an average of two minutes off their journeys in the first three months of the new bus timetable, new figures show.\n\nThe new bus network \u2014 the biggest change to Brisbane's timetables in two decades \u2014 started on June 30 this year.\n\nPatronage has increased by 17 per cent, while journey times have decreased by 7 per cent between July and September this year, when compared with the same period last year.\n\nBoth the state government and the city's council have lauded the early success of the new timetable, but transport advocates say improvements show the drastic need for a transport overhaul across south-east Queensland.\n\nData supplied to the ABC shows comparative analysis of patronage, journey and trip times for Brisbane buses between July and September 2024 and the same period this year.\n\nYear Trips ('000) Journeys ('000) Trip time (mins) Journey time (mins) 2024 22,072 15,900 18.2 31.6 2025 24,727 18,642 16.6 29.5 Per cent change 12% 17% -9% -7%\n\nThe data includes a period before Queensland's former Labor government brought in 50-cent fares in August 2024, which was found to have increased patronage.\n\nData at the end of the six-month 50-cent trial showed patronage increased on all public transport by 18.3 per cent, with bus travel up 15.8 per cent.\n\nTransport Minister Brent Mickelberg said the new bus network was giving commuters more frequent, reliable and connected services that actually worked for them.\n\nSince the new timetable, the proportion of buses that were on time increased by 5 per cent, up to 81 per cent.\n\nNew Brisbane bus timetable About three-quarters of Brisbane's bus services will change in some way, with services being cut, added, rerouted, renamed, or split in half.\n\nMr Mickelberg said Queenslanders had saved about $236 million on 114 million trips since 50-cent fares had been made permanent.\n\nLord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said the new network would deliver 160,000 extra trips every year and faster journeys for more than 45 million passengers.\n\n\"With more than 600 people moving to our city every week, we need to keep growing our transport network to keep Brisbane moving,\" he said.\n\n'No silver bullet' for congestion\n\nDespite the early success, peak motoring body RACQ said the new network had not had a meaningful impact on congestion, although it had not expected it to.\n\nRACQ head of public policy, Michael Kane, said the scale of congestion issues in Brisbane and south-east Queensland was such that there was no silver bullet.\n\n\"The bus network review should be considered as stage one of a much deeper and longer process of reform and change that is needed for public transport,\" he said.\n\nSix million people are expected to call south-east Queensland home by 2046. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)\n\nMr Kane said the organisation's member surveys since the new timetable launched showed that there was strong support for the Brisbane Metro in Brisbane and Logan.\n\n\"We can see the Brisbane Metro is very popular, but it's only two routes, mainly through the inner-city, and so what RACQ has been calling for \u2026 is a transformation of the bus network across the whole of south-east Queensland,\" he said.\n\nThe Adelaide Street tunnel, a dedicated connection for busways in the city, opened on September 29 and will affect the data in the future.\n\nBus services are now running on time about 80 per cent of the time. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nCr Schrinner said the council's focus had \"always been on helping residents get home sooner and safer, and these results show that's exactly what's happening\".\n\nTranslink's customer experience surveys for south-east Queensland bus passengers in 2025 showed an overall rating of 3.7/5 in July, 3.6/5 in August and 4.1/5 in September.\n\nBut council opposition leader Jared Cassidy said community feedback in surveys conducted by Labor painted a different picture, with the average rating of the network at 1.4/10.\n\nOf 361 responses, 70 per cent of people said their commute had increased, and 50 per cent said the number of transfers they had to perform had increased, while 70 per cent said they were not happy with the changes.\n\n\"Adrian Schrinner and his LNP council are pulling the wool over Brisbane's eyes,\" he said.\n\nWith south-east Queensland's population expected to reach 6 million by 2046, Mr Kane said current planning would not meet demand.\n\n\"We're going to catch up with Sydney's population in 20 years' time and Sydney has far greater levels of public transport and road infrastructure, which they've built over many decades, and in that 20 years, we will not be able to build the infrastructure that Sydney has today,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not going to be fixing congestion overnight.\"\n\nCalls for active transport links\n\nGriffith University transport and planning adjunct professor Matthew Burke said the new figures were in line with the expected outcomes of the new bus timetable, but it was great to see improvements in patronage and journey times.\n\n\"Anecdotally, there's been confusion for people in the changeover, that's always going to happen, but the department and operators seem to have done a reasonable job explaining the changes,\" he said.\n\nMatthew Burke says connecting active transport within suburbs and to public transport is the missing link for commuters. (ABC News: Glen Armstrong)\n\nHowever, the Bicycle Queensland chief executive said there was still a lot of \"mess in the system\" and authorities needed to address the disconnected and disjointed active transport network.\n\n\"[The new network] is proof of what's possible without a lot of money,\" he said.\n\n\"The southern bus network review was done without big additional investment into services; it was done through tactical planning and thinking about the system, not through mega projects and building.\n\n\"Buses on the north side will need a similar level of restructuring, and we shouldn't be afraid of doing that in a large hit like we did on the south side.\"",

(ABC Rural: Laurissa Smith)\n\n\"Then there's this thing we call soil moisture holding capacity, like how big is your water bucket, how much soil moisture can you store?\n\n\"The bigger the bucket, the deeper your soil, the longer your crop is going to grow.\"",

Now there are, in a tacit admission by the administration that, contrary to what it has consistently argued, that tariffs do raise prices and are increasingly paid by US consumers. Bananas and coffee illustrate perfectly how misconceived the tariffs are. Credit: Bloomberg Bananas and coffee illustrate perfectly how misconceived the tariffs are. The US imports almost all its bananas and coffee, most of its from South America and, in the case of coffee, from Brazil in particular. More than 99 per cent of US coffee is imported, with nearly a third of it from Brazil. Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on Brazil \u2013 a base 10 per cent tariff and an extra 40 per cent rate as punishment for the prosecution of Trump\u2019s friend and ideological ally, Jair Bolsonaro, for an attempted coup. Not surprisingly, the retail price of coffee has soared nearly 19 per cent from a year ago.\n\nSimilarly, the price of bananas, which the US mainly imports from Guatemala and Ecuador, is up about 7 per cent. Loading Beef prices, where even Australia, which has a trade deficit with the US, is subject to Trump\u2019s 10 per cent baseline tariffs, have also surged. According to the St Louis Federal Reserve, they are up by more than 14 per cent this year. The US herd is its smallest in 70 years, so the tariffs have a magnified impact on prices. More broadly, the US Tax Foundation has estimated that the tariffs have pushed up retail prices by 4.9 per cent this year, while the Yale Budget Lab has calculated that they will cost the average US household $US1800 ($2750).\n\nWith the political pain mounting, Trump has decided to roll back some of the tariffs on products that have high visibility with consumers and their perceptions of affordability. In other words, Trump\u2019s strategy for lowering prices is to unwind some of the tariffs that he has claimed would help lower prices. The administration consistently claims that prices and inflation are falling, when the official data, and households\u2019 own experiences, say otherwise. While not backing away from its erroneous claims, the move to lower tariffs on a raft of household staples contradicts that White House messaging. It is conceivable that the move to wind back some of the tariffs will be less effective than the White House hopes.\n\nIn the early months after the tariffs were announced, US importers stockpiled products before the tariffs came into effect, blunting their impact on prices. With Trump dithering over the introduction of the new duties, and constantly tinkering with them as trade deals were negotiated with individual countries and companies, importers generally absorbed some of their cost while waiting to understand where the final trade picture would settle (if it ever settles). More recently, a greater proportion of their cost has been passed onto consumers, a trend that is likely to continue. Goldman Sachs has calculated that, in April, US imports picked up about 64 per cent of the tab for those tariffs in force, with foreign exporters absorbing 14 per cent and US consumers 22 per cent. By October, the US companies were paying 27 per cent of the new costs, foreign exporters 18 per cent and US consumers 55 per cent. By mid-2026, Goldman has said, importers will pay 8 per cent, foreign exporters 25 per cent (as US importers identify suppliers willing to absorb more of the cost) and US consumers 67 per cent.\n\nAs was the case when, in Trump\u2019s last term he imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, there will also be an element of US companies using the protection they provide to raise their own prices. Trump\u2019s popularity and perceptions of his credibility as a manager of the economy have been sinking, raising concerns within the Republican ranks about their fate at next year\u2019s midterms. Credit: Bloomberg The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that the cost to steel-consuming companies was $US650,000 for every steel industry job saved by the tariffs and that they added $US270,000 to domestic steel producers\u2019 profits for each of those jobs saved. In any category where the US doesn\u2019t produce a product, or where its domestic industries can\u2019t fully supply products Trump has hit with tariffs \u2013 even some of those where he is reducing the rate of the duty \u2013 there is an opportunity for domestic companies to raise prices or, where tariffs are being reduced, for importers to maintain prices and boost their profitability in the process. For lovers of bananas and coffee, the tariffs might have been lowered, but the national emergency might not yet be over!",

        "text": "Localised: 95 per cent of patients will be alive 10 years after treatment. Locally advanced: The five-year survival rate is 70-90 per cent. Metastatic: This falls to 30 per cent. 2. What is my risk of developing prostate cancer? The average man\u2019s risk is one in eight, but certain cohorts have higher risks. For Afro-Caribbean men, the risk is one in four. There is more data on the way about patients with a family history of prostate cancer, and this is related to age (a first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at 55 or below is at greater risk than someone with a relative who had the disease at 90).\n\nLoading Then there are those with the BRCA gene mutation. There is no guarantee that you will have prostate cancer if you have the BRCA mutation, but there is a strong association. We\u2019re focusing on identifying high-risk groups to develop screening programmes. We give people a questionnaire and, depending on the answers, we decide whether they need a blood test and scanning. 3. What symptoms should I look out for? Prostate cancer in its early stages is asymptomatic, so we pick up a lot of people when they are having cholesterol checks, and a prostate blood test is suggested. Symptoms predominantly involve the waterworks, as the water pipe goes through the prostate. When the prostate enlarges, it can cause problems. Potential symptoms include blood in the urine, back pain, fatigue, and sometimes erectile dysfunction. Early disease is slightly ambiguous, but in more advanced disease, we see back pain and lymph node enlargement. Don\u2019t wait for symptoms if you are in a high-risk group.\n\nFatigue can be a sign of something more serious. Credit: iStock 4. What\u2019s the main test used for screening? The way we test for prostate cancer now is a blood test: the PSA (prostate-specific antigen). This is an enzyme that the prostate produces to keep the semen in a semi-liquid form. The test was invented in 1977 and is like any other blood test. 5. How accurate is the PSA test? The sensitivity (the ability correctly to spot cancer) of the PSA for detecting prostate cancer is 70-80 per cent, but the specificity (the ability correctly to diagnose the absence of cancer) is 30-40 per cent. The specificity is the issue, as PSA levels can fluctuate: it\u2019s prostate-specific but not prostate cancer-specific. If the prostate increases in size, or there\u2019s a prostate infection or a urinary tract infection, the PSA goes up. After recent ejaculation, the PSA goes up. If someone goes for a cycle ride and then has a blood test, the PSA goes up. Hence why we tend to use MRI scans alongside the PSA test.\n\n6. If I have a prostate cancer diagnosis, what happens next? Patients will have an MRI and biopsy, then return for a meeting. They\u2019ll go to a multidisciplinary team meeting with all specialists \u2013 oncologists, surgeons, nurses \u2013 who work together. We\u2019ll have a discussion with the patient and their family, ensuring liaison is the most important thing. We place patients into risk groups (low, medium, high) and discuss treatment options. The earlier that cancer is picked up, the more treatment options are available. If we\u2019ve picked it up at a more advanced level, the options are more restricted. Treatment options include: Close monitoring \u2013 PSA and MRI tests. PSA is a good monitoring tool and MRIs are far quicker when used in this way. This is not treatment, just keeping a watchful eye.\n\nLoading Focal therapy \u2013 treatment applied only to the specific areas with cancer identified by MRI. This can be ultrasound (high-intensity focused ultrasound to destroy cancerous areas) or focal cryotherapy (freezing and killing cells with very low temperatures). Focal therapy is less invasive but there\u2019s a 20-40 per cent chance the cancer can come back. Radiotherapy \u2013 radiation applied to kill cancer cells. This includes external beam radiation, brachytherapy (radioactive seeds placed in the gland), and targeted radiotherapy. Robotic surgery \u2013 removing the prostate using robot-assisted surgery for precision. This means significantly less blood loss and faster return to work than traditional open surgery. The main focus is to cure patients. Patients are given all options without bias. Patients can also decide to get another opinion \u2013 they do that a lot.\n\n7. How quickly does it spread? When prostate cancer is diagnosed, we look at three parameters: PSA level, grade on biopsy, and scan findings. Low-grade prostate cancer is slow-growing and the risk of progression is 20-30 per cent over 10 years. Intermediate-grade can spread over months to a few years. High-grade can be fast-growing and may spread in a few months. This needs urgent treatment.\n\n8. What are the potential side effects? No treatment has zero side effects. The main side effects are ejaculatory issues, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. In some cases, we provide hormonal treatment that induces a male menopause. Loading Testosterone is to prostate cancer what fuel is to fire, so sometimes we administer these hormones. This can cause mood changes, fatigue, breast enlargement, breast tenderness, anger issues, brain fog, and potential long-term bone loss, similar to women in menopause. There\u2019s also an associated risk of cardiac issues in the long term with hormone treatment. Getting back to your usual routine and function can take some time. Credit: iStock\n\n9. What can be done to alleviate the side effects? If someone has erectile issues, we can offer tablets, injections or vacuum pumps, or we can insert an inflatable cylinder into the penis \u2013 it\u2019s rare but it\u2019s done. If there is incontinence, most of the time normal function returns. We work on pelvic muscle training, and have pads, penile clamps, emotional support and counselling. We can implant an artificial sphincter, but robot surgery and aftercare is sufficiently advanced, meaning enough of the anatomy and nerve structure is preserved and very few people need the sphincter. Most of the time post-surgery, the first week is stormy, but within about three months, 70 per cent will regain control, and within 12 months most people are dry. Only 5 per cent have lasting issues. Faecal incontinence is more associated with radiotherapy and may require surgery \u2013 but this affects only 0.1 per cent. It\u2019s extremely rare and it all improves over time. With hormone treatments, we can give drugs to prevent breast enlargement. If they are experiencing hot flushes, we can offer acupuncture. Exercise is very helpful in dealing with weight gain or diabetes.\n\n10. Can people decide against treatment? Suppose a 93-year-old man is diagnosed with prostate cancer \u2013 we put him on a watchful waiting pathway, where we do some tests and keep an eye on them. The PSA is a good marker once there is a diagnosis. We use doubling time. If someone has a PSA test in January and they have a PSA of four, and by March it\u2019s eight, that is definitely something we need to investigate. We know overdiagnosis and overtreatment can be a problem and we do a lot of work to prevent that happening. If a patient doesn\u2019t want any treatment, we will watch them and test them. 11. How do I know whether the treatment is working? We monitor patients based on PSA levels, scans, and symptoms. We bring patients back to clinic, involve their GPs, and engage community nurses. Success rates are very high: 90-95 per cent for locally confined prostate cancer.\n\nThis depends on initial pathology, but if the cancer is confined to the prostate, we\u2019re talking about a significant chance of complete cure. We\u2019re seeing major improvements in survival data with modern treatments. 12. What is the effect on my fertility? Treatment will render you infertile. We routinely bank patients\u2019 sperm \u2013 if they haven\u2019t completed their family, we organise that the next day [after diagnosis], usually. 13. What are the chances of cancer coming back? It all depends on the treatment. Success rates are very high.",

But we didn't. We did the mature thing that created a pathway of common sense for better energy and climate policy in this country. And much of those principles are shared by the Liberal and National Party. And that's proven by the position we've got to. And while it might seem to have been a little torturous at times, I think you've got a better policy in front of the Australian people as an alternative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Police say it has seized a record amount of knives and machetes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 15,000 weapons have been taken off Victoria's streets so far in 2025, an average of 47 per day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the second consecutive year the record was broken, most weapons were taken during searches related to known offenders and police also targeted youth gang members.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush says there is no place for knives and machetes at shopping centres, bus stops or train stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" And Victoria Police will continue that focus to prevent this kind of crime.

And if we are to reach their target in 2050, they will have to double again. That's not responsible emissions reduction, that's not doing our fair share. Now this is hurting Australian families and it's hurting Australia's amazing small businesses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new stance comes after the Liberal party followed in the footsteps of their Coalition partners in scrapping net zero from their policy platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say they want to unlock more investment in gas supply and infrastructure, establishing an east coast gas reservation scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition also wants to strip climate change from the national energy regulator's list of objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal leader Sussan Ley and Nationals leader David Littleproud say they will remove emissions reduction considerations from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which should boost supply and lower prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nLEY: \"By giving the national electricity market the objective of affordable power we know that the investments we make and the rules that we set will be all about bringing energy prices down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLITTLEPROUD: \"Exactly and this is a practical way of changing the mandate of AEMO. Their first mandate is to source energy predicated on the 2030-35 targets, that means that we have latent supply, or base load, sitting there that we need to increase the supply of and actually drive down those prices by the simple principle of demand and supply.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSIRO and international energy experts have consistently found that renewable energy with storage and backup generation to ensure reliable supply - known as firming - is the cheapest form of new electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in their new energy plan, the Coalition hopes to shift away from renewables by removing nuclear technology bans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSIRO estimates it would take at least 15 years for Australia's first nuclear reactor to come online after these bans are scrapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals leader says they intend to boost fossil fuel production in the short term to help ease that transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taking a technology agnostic approach to that, when you look in my home state of Queensland, they intend to sweat out their coal-fired power stations. What you do by expanding it is you actually put that downward pressure right across all sources of energy and what it also does is it buys the time for us to transition into things like nuclear energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest report from the independent Climate Action Tracker puts the world on course for devastation, with global temperatures set to heat up by 2.6 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times by the end of the century.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say these rises could see the end of agriculture in the United Kingdom and much of Europe, with the loss of coral reefs, rising sea levels and lethal heat and droughts expected around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Joel Gilmore, from Griffith University, is a member of the Climate Council and an energy systems expert.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the new policy approach from the Coalition is a major setback for the climate and the future of renewables investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fighting against net zero is fighting against gravity. This is a future the whole world is moving towards and every time Australia flip flops on this policy, investors are starting globally to look at other places to invest. So it is critical that we have a clear, united view that we are going to do net zero and bring costs down for all Australians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says they will still seek to reduce emissions in alignment with countries around the world but they have not set any targets and are promising to remove what they describes as 'punitive' mandates against high emissions projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey'll also scrap penalties under the New Vehicles Emission Standard and ditch the tax benefit exemption policy for electric vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government immediately criticised the Coalition's policy update.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Penny Wong has told the ABC the decision to abandon net zero has pushed the Liberal party to the fringes of its conservative wing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This used to be a serious mainstream political party in this country and now it is overrun by the fringes. They are trying to outflank Pauline Hanson. And what I'd say to Sussan Ley and to Andrew Hastie and to Angus Taylor is you can't be more Pauline than Pauline. But ultimately, what their confused, divided approach will lead to is higher prices for Australians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senator says the weakened climate targets also show disrespect towards Pacific nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer comments have been backed by the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If anyone thinks that there is certainty in the Coalition going forward, then they're not paying any attention to the rabble and clown show that the Coalition have become when it comes to energy policy and climate policy. Uncertainty - that kills off investment and less investment means higher power prices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate policy has been a contentious issue within the Coalition for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the last two federal elections, the Liberal Party lost inner-city seats to independent candidates focused on climate action.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Liberal Senator Jonathon Duniam has rejected suggestions the climate policy reversal could hurt the Coalition at the next election or on the international stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow energy minister Dan Tehan says he believes voters will recognise the Coalition can deliver on the affordable energy promises that Labor took to the May federal election.\n\n\n\n",

However, the ACT has strong Work Health and Safety laws. And we are required to eliminate risk as much as is reasonably practicable. For asbestos, that means isolating the space, testing and remdiating. All of this is required to be done a by licensed absestos contractor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 100 people, mostly police, have been injured in Mexico City during demonstrations that saw thousands march in protest against corruption and deteriorating security conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTensions exploded when masked protesters tore down metal barriers protecting the National Palace, prompting riot police to respond with tear gas and smoke bombs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demonstrations have mostly been organised by Generation Z youth groups, who say they are angered by violence, including the assassination of Urupan Mayor Carlos Manzo.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtester Manuel Martinez says crime is the key issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We came because of what happened to Carlos Manzo.

Source: SBS, Getty Proficiency in Microsoft Office was the second-most in-demand skill across industries, while person-centred skills, including relationship management, leadership, relationship building, and team leadership, also rated highly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis, cleaning, project management, and investigation rounded out the top 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills that are considered qualifications, such as driver's licences and workplace health and safety certifications, weren't included in SEEK's analysis.\n\n\n\nWhat do the findings tell us?\n\nWhile there are increasing concerns around the use of AI in workplaces and potential job losses, SEEK's analysis suggests there's still strong demand for skills that only people possess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As tools and technology continue to transform the way we work, we can see that Aussie employers are prioritising human skills, or what can be known as 'power skills',\" Kylie Pascoe from SEEK's Customer Insights and Research team said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Businesses are looking for people who can communicate effectively, build strong relationships, and lead teams with empathy and clarity to do great work and make the most of new technology.\"\n\n\n\nIf you don't already have these in-demand skills, developing them through upskilling, training, or hands-on experience can help you stand out in the job market, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring your skills are listed prominently on your resume and job site profiles is also \"really important\" in helping recruiters assess if you're the right fit for any role you apply for, Pascoe added.\n\n\n\nHow to demonstrate your job skills in an interview\n\nIf you get to the interview stage of the hiring process, you'll typically be asked to give real-life examples of how and when you've used certain skills that are relevant to the role you've applied for.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to do this effectively is by using the STAR method to structure your responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe STAR method is broken down into four parts: situation, task, action, and result.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide context for your example, describe the situation that took place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen talk about what your task was in the situation, provide details about the action you took to resolve the situation, and finish by describing the result of that action.\n\n\n\n",

Australia have got this!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the night of November 16, 2005, when Socceroos member John Aloisi scored a penalty against Uruguay in front of more than 83,000 fans packed into Sydney's Olympic Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers watched around the country, including around 8000 fans in Melbourne's Federation Square, hoping to witness the historic moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yay!!!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n20 years later, this match remains the most watched event in S-B-S history.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd some of the key players of the night, including Aloisi, Mark Schwarzer and Josip Skoko, have reunited in Melbourne to reflect on the night that forever changed Australian football.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Aloisi says that night is a good memory for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The whole evening just had that belief and confidence that we are going to the qualifier for some reasons, just had that aurora about it, and taking that penalty, as I said, I never took a penalty so for that kind of my first penalty, was extra special and I still take it the same day same way today.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Socceroos great has been coaching at the A-League club Western United for the past three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe remains in a holding pattern after the club's expulsion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while his coaching career remains uncertain, Aloisi says he's watching many young players making their best kicks on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got a number of players who I think in 2023 knocking on the door and not too far away, and we give them that belief that from that encouragement to go, you know, play their game, play their football, and they've been really good in the past year with us. And yeah, that's what they are thriving for, they want to play for the Socceroos and the World Cup around the corner makes it extra bit, em, important for them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother hero in the game against Uruguay was Mark Schwarzer , whose penalty saves set the stage for Australia to win the penalty shootout.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says sometimes when he watches the footage, he still gets goosebumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We all knew... We were talking about that moment so many times, how important that moment was gonna be one day if we have a qualifier for World Cup, then obviously, when you accomplish it, the realisation of satisfaction and the overwhelming sense of like relief that football was on the map and people were taking it seriously.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe watershed moment on November 16, 2005, ignited a golden era.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext year's tournament in North America will mark the Socceroos' sixth consecutive World Cup finals appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchwarzer meanwhile is preparing for another career highlight, as one of seven people inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Schwarzer says he's relieved that following the victory in 2005, football has become an important sport in Australia.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The federal Opposition has emerged from joint party room talks spruiking a climate and energy policy that highlights power prices and removes specific emissions reduction goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFronting the media on Sunday afternoon, Opposition leader Sussan Ley said the plan was \"all about affordable energy and responsible emissions reduction\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why wouldn't you, as prime minister, prioritise affordable energy instead of the ideology of an 82 per cent renewable grid by 2030,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fundamentally, completely around the wrong way when it comes to looking after Australians who deserve a government that backs them in and understands that affordable power is the number one consideration for citizens in this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile saying the Coalition would keep Australia in the Paris Agreement, Ley would not be drawn on questions of whether the Opposition would submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations, as required from all signatories to the global climate treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've already said that we won't make any comments about targets from opposition, and that we will look at our NDCs, our short-term targets, once in government,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition meeting looms as Liberal rejects 'Nationals-lite' label after net zero dumped\n\nCountries that wish to fulfil their obligations under the Paris Agreement must ratchet up their targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions every five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a policy document released on Sunday, the Opposition said it would reduce emissions \"on average year on year, for every five-year period of Australia's Nationally Determined Contribution\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt did not specify by how much it would reduce emissions, only saying it would be done \"in Australia's national interest by doing our fair share considering the real performance of OECD countries\" and \"as fast and as far as technology allows, without imposing mandated costs on families or industry\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking alongside Ley, National Party leader David Littleproud said: \"We will make sure that we don't streak ahead, but we're not going to be a laggard and we should peg ourselves to what the rest of the world's doing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Liberals and National parties dropped a net zero by 2050 commitment from their platforms at recent party meetings.\n\n\n\nIn its policy document, the Opposition said: \"Whilst it is not our policy to set long-term targets, net zero would be a welcome outcome, if achieved through technology, choice and voluntary markets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral days ago, the Liberal Party put out a press release saying it would scrap Labor's emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 and \"not legislate mandates in government\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said last week that the Opposition's direction on climate and energy policy was \"choosing to take Australia backwards\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're walking away from jobs for Australians, and investment certainty for business,\" he told reporters on Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're walking away from climate action because they fundamentally do not believe in the science of climate change.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Bowen heads to Brazil to push Australia's COP31 hosting bid amid standoff with T\u00fcrkiye\n\nLittleproud said on Sunday the Albanese government was continuing \"to throw sledges at the Coalition about a 2015 debate about the science of climate change\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This debate is not one predicated on science. It is one predicated on economics,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong, a veteran of Canberra's so-called climate wars, earlier said the Coalition's decision to abandon net zero would do little to shift public opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatered-down climate targets would drive up power prices for Australians and show disrespect towards Pacific nations, Wong said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why over a third of this nation's citizens want to migrate to Australia\n\nThe Opposition's policy proposals\n\nThe newly released document \u2014 titled Affordable and Responsible \u2014 also outlines a policy called the Affordable Electricity Scheme, which the Opposition said would differ from the government's Capacity Investment Scheme by being more technology-neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey on Sunday criticised government agencies that \"invest or underwrite taxpayers' money in wind and solar, which don't need their help\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition has also said, if it were to win government, it would remove the emissions reduction objective from the National Energy Objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn emissions reduction objective was added to the rules governing national electricity, gas and related retail markets during the Albanese government's first term.\n\n\n\nThe Opposition also reiterated its support for lifting a moratorium on nuclear energy, which was first implemented federally under a former Coalition government in the late 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the policy document does not detail plans for building nuclear power facilities at the sites of existing coal plants, something former Opposition leader Peter Dutton took to the May election, at which the Coalition suffered a crushing defeat .\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the last two federal elections, the Liberal Party lost inner-city seats to independent candidates focused on climate action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition's plan also talks up the importance of gas in Australia's energy system, pledging to \"drive new gas exploration and development across key basins including Beetaloo, Narrabri, Barossa, Browse, Cooper and Scarborough \u2014 bringing significant new supply online\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Hopes dashed as global fossil fuel emissions increase in 2025 SBS News 04:44 English\n\n\"Approvals will be streamlined, infrastructure investment supported, and gas delivery added to the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation,\" the policy document read.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition also reiterated support for a \"prospective\" gas reservation policy \u2014 which Dutton had promised ahead of the 2025 election.\n\n\n\n\n\nA gas reservation \u2014 such as Western Australia has had since 2006 \u2014 would reserve a certain portion of Australia's gas for the domestic market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of Australian gas is currently exported, and some experts say this has raised domestic prices by making Australian companies compete with international buyers willing to pay more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "That should have been obvious to Trump and his advisers \u2013 as it was to most with a basic understanding of trade and economics \u2013 from the outset, but Trump\u2019s Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, was adamant during a Senate hearing in April, when the reciprocal tariffs were supposed to take effect, that there would be no exemptions or exclusions from them. Now there are, in a tacit admission by the administration that, contrary to what it has consistently argued, that tariffs do raise prices and are increasingly paid by US consumers. Bananas and coffee illustrate perfectly how misconceived the tariffs are. Credit: Bloomberg Bananas and coffee illustrate perfectly how misconceived the tariffs are. The US imports almost all its bananas and coffee, most of its from South America and, in the case of coffee, from Brazil in particular. More than 99 per cent of US coffee is imported, with nearly a third of it from Brazil. Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on Brazil \u2013 a base 10 per cent tariff and an extra 40 per cent rate as punishment for the prosecution of Trump\u2019s friend and ideological ally, Jair Bolsonaro, for an attempted coup. Not surprisingly, the retail price of coffee has soared nearly 19 per cent from a year ago.\n\nSimilarly, the price of bananas, which the US mainly imports from Guatemala and Ecuador, is up about 7 per cent. Loading Beef prices, where even Australia, which has a trade deficit with the US, is subject to Trump\u2019s 10 per cent baseline tariffs, have also surged. According to the St Louis Federal Reserve, they are up by more than 14 per cent this year. The US herd is its smallest in 70 years, so the tariffs have a magnified impact on prices. More broadly, the US Tax Foundation has estimated that the tariffs have pushed up retail prices by 4.9 per cent this year, while the Yale Budget Lab has calculated that they will cost the average US household $US1800 ($2750).\n\nWith the political pain mounting, Trump has decided to roll back some of the tariffs on products that have high visibility with consumers and their perceptions of affordability. In other words, Trump\u2019s strategy for lowering prices is to unwind some of the tariffs that he has claimed would help lower prices. The administration consistently claims that prices and inflation are falling, when the official data, and households\u2019 own experiences, say otherwise. While not backing away from its erroneous claims, the move to lower tariffs on a raft of household staples contradicts that White House messaging. It is conceivable that the move to wind back some of the tariffs will be less effective than the White House hopes.\n\nIn the early months after the tariffs were announced, US importers stockpiled products before the tariffs came into effect, blunting their impact on prices. With Trump dithering over the introduction of the new duties, and constantly tinkering with them as trade deals were negotiated with individual countries and companies, importers generally absorbed some of their cost while waiting to understand where the final trade picture would settle (if it ever settles). More recently, a greater proportion of their cost has been passed onto consumers, a trend that is likely to continue. Goldman Sachs has calculated that, in April, US imports picked up about 64 per cent of the tab for those tariffs in force, with foreign exporters absorbing 14 per cent and US consumers 22 per cent. By October, the US companies were paying 27 per cent of the new costs, foreign exporters 18 per cent and US consumers 55 per cent. By mid-2026, Goldman has said, importers will pay 8 per cent, foreign exporters 25 per cent (as US importers identify suppliers willing to absorb more of the cost) and US consumers 67 per cent.\n\nAs was the case when, in Trump\u2019s last term he imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, there will also be an element of US companies using the protection they provide to raise their own prices. Trump\u2019s popularity and perceptions of his credibility as a manager of the economy have been sinking, raising concerns within the Republican ranks about their fate at next year\u2019s midterms. Credit: Bloomberg The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that the cost to steel-consuming companies was $US650,000 for every steel industry job saved by the tariffs and that they added $US270,000 to domestic steel producers\u2019 profits for each of those jobs saved. In any category where the US doesn\u2019t produce a product, or where its domestic industries can\u2019t fully supply products Trump has hit with tariffs \u2013 even some of those where he is reducing the rate of the duty \u2013 there is an opportunity for domestic companies to raise prices or, where tariffs are being reduced, for importers to maintain prices and boost their profitability in the process. For lovers of bananas and coffee, the tariffs might have been lowered, but the national emergency might not yet be over!",

        "text": "Localised: 95 per cent of patients will be alive 10 years after treatment. Locally advanced: The five-year survival rate is 70-90 per cent. Metastatic: This falls to 30 per cent. 2. What is my risk of developing prostate cancer? The average man\u2019s risk is one in eight, but certain cohorts have higher risks. For Afro-Caribbean men, the risk is one in four. There is more data on the way about patients with a family history of prostate cancer, and this is related to age (a first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at 55 or below is at greater risk than someone with a relative who had the disease at 90).\n\nLoading Then there are those with the BRCA gene mutation. There is no guarantee that you will have prostate cancer if you have the BRCA mutation, but there is a strong association. We\u2019re focusing on identifying high-risk groups to develop screening programmes. We give people a questionnaire and, depending on the answers, we decide whether they need a blood test and scanning. 3. What symptoms should I look out for? Prostate cancer in its early stages is asymptomatic, so we pick up a lot of people when they are having cholesterol checks, and a prostate blood test is suggested. Symptoms predominantly involve the waterworks, as the water pipe goes through the prostate. When the prostate enlarges, it can cause problems. Potential symptoms include blood in the urine, back pain, fatigue, and sometimes erectile dysfunction. Early disease is slightly ambiguous, but in more advanced disease, we see back pain and lymph node enlargement. Don\u2019t wait for symptoms if you are in a high-risk group.\n\nFatigue can be a sign of something more serious. Credit: iStock 4. What\u2019s the main test used for screening? The way we test for prostate cancer now is a blood test: the PSA (prostate-specific antigen). This is an enzyme that the prostate produces to keep the semen in a semi-liquid form. The test was invented in 1977 and is like any other blood test. 5. How accurate is the PSA test? The sensitivity (the ability correctly to spot cancer) of the PSA for detecting prostate cancer is 70-80 per cent, but the specificity (the ability correctly to diagnose the absence of cancer) is 30-40 per cent. The specificity is the issue, as PSA levels can fluctuate: it\u2019s prostate-specific but not prostate cancer-specific. If the prostate increases in size, or there\u2019s a prostate infection or a urinary tract infection, the PSA goes up. After recent ejaculation, the PSA goes up. If someone goes for a cycle ride and then has a blood test, the PSA goes up. Hence why we tend to use MRI scans alongside the PSA test.\n\n6. If I have a prostate cancer diagnosis, what happens next? Patients will have an MRI and biopsy, then return for a meeting. They\u2019ll go to a multidisciplinary team meeting with all specialists \u2013 oncologists, surgeons, nurses \u2013 who work together. We\u2019ll have a discussion with the patient and their family, ensuring liaison is the most important thing. We place patients into risk groups (low, medium, high) and discuss treatment options. The earlier that cancer is picked up, the more treatment options are available. If we\u2019ve picked it up at a more advanced level, the options are more restricted. Treatment options include: Close monitoring \u2013 PSA and MRI tests. PSA is a good monitoring tool and MRIs are far quicker when used in this way. This is not treatment, just keeping a watchful eye.\n\nLoading Focal therapy \u2013 treatment applied only to the specific areas with cancer identified by MRI. This can be ultrasound (high-intensity focused ultrasound to destroy cancerous areas) or focal cryotherapy (freezing and killing cells with very low temperatures). Focal therapy is less invasive but there\u2019s a 20-40 per cent chance the cancer can come back. Radiotherapy \u2013 radiation applied to kill cancer cells. This includes external beam radiation, brachytherapy (radioactive seeds placed in the gland), and targeted radiotherapy. Robotic surgery \u2013 removing the prostate using robot-assisted surgery for precision. This means significantly less blood loss and faster return to work than traditional open surgery. The main focus is to cure patients. Patients are given all options without bias. Patients can also decide to get another opinion \u2013 they do that a lot.\n\n7. How quickly does it spread? When prostate cancer is diagnosed, we look at three parameters: PSA level, grade on biopsy, and scan findings. Low-grade prostate cancer is slow-growing and the risk of progression is 20-30 per cent over 10 years. Intermediate-grade can spread over months to a few years. High-grade can be fast-growing and may spread in a few months. This needs urgent treatment.\n\n8. What are the potential side effects? No treatment has zero side effects. The main side effects are ejaculatory issues, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. In some cases, we provide hormonal treatment that induces a male menopause. Loading Testosterone is to prostate cancer what fuel is to fire, so sometimes we administer these hormones. This can cause mood changes, fatigue, breast enlargement, breast tenderness, anger issues, brain fog, and potential long-term bone loss, similar to women in menopause. There\u2019s also an associated risk of cardiac issues in the long term with hormone treatment. Getting back to your usual routine and function can take some time. Credit: iStock\n\n9. What can be done to alleviate the side effects? If someone has erectile issues, we can offer tablets, injections or vacuum pumps, or we can insert an inflatable cylinder into the penis \u2013 it\u2019s rare but it\u2019s done. If there is incontinence, most of the time normal function returns. We work on pelvic muscle training, and have pads, penile clamps, emotional support and counselling. We can implant an artificial sphincter, but robot surgery and aftercare is sufficiently advanced, meaning enough of the anatomy and nerve structure is preserved and very few people need the sphincter. Most of the time post-surgery, the first week is stormy, but within about three months, 70 per cent will regain control, and within 12 months most people are dry. Only 5 per cent have lasting issues. Faecal incontinence is more associated with radiotherapy and may require surgery \u2013 but this affects only 0.1 per cent. It\u2019s extremely rare and it all improves over time. With hormone treatments, we can give drugs to prevent breast enlargement. If they are experiencing hot flushes, we can offer acupuncture. Exercise is very helpful in dealing with weight gain or diabetes.\n\n10. Can people decide against treatment? Suppose a 93-year-old man is diagnosed with prostate cancer \u2013 we put him on a watchful waiting pathway, where we do some tests and keep an eye on them. The PSA is a good marker once there is a diagnosis. We use doubling time. If someone has a PSA test in January and they have a PSA of four, and by March it\u2019s eight, that is definitely something we need to investigate. We know overdiagnosis and overtreatment can be a problem and we do a lot of work to prevent that happening. If a patient doesn\u2019t want any treatment, we will watch them and test them. 11. How do I know whether the treatment is working? We monitor patients based on PSA levels, scans, and symptoms. We bring patients back to clinic, involve their GPs, and engage community nurses. Success rates are very high: 90-95 per cent for locally confined prostate cancer.\n\nThis depends on initial pathology, but if the cancer is confined to the prostate, we\u2019re talking about a significant chance of complete cure. We\u2019re seeing major improvements in survival data with modern treatments. 12. What is the effect on my fertility? Treatment will render you infertile. We routinely bank patients\u2019 sperm \u2013 if they haven\u2019t completed their family, we organise that the next day [after diagnosis], usually. 13. What are the chances of cancer coming back? It all depends on the treatment. Success rates are very high.",

        "text": "It\u2019s not a fun time to be a Liberal Party moderate. This year\u2019s federal election wiped out a series of heavyweights, reducing the faction to just 16 members out of a partyroom of 51. It was also the second election in which teals tightened their grip over the inner-city seats traditionally the domain of moderate MPs.\n\nThe faction has now been comprehensively steamrolled on net zero, with the party of Robert Menzies last week adopting the climate change policies of a bunch of reckless and ignorant political operatives otherwise known as the Nationals.\n\nThe final policy is actually far worse than it seems at first glance. Not only has the Liberal Party abandoned any commitment to net zero, it also pledged to scrap Labor\u2019s legislated suite of emissions reduction mechanisms and opened the door to using taxpayer funds to subsidise new or extended coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe Herald does not dispute that rising energy costs are a massive challenge for consumers and industry. But for many conservative MPs, this new policy is climate denialism masked as concern for affordability.\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s partyroom showdown on net zero, Liberal moderates were threatening to quit the frontbench should the party drop its Scott Morrison-era commitment to net zero.",

        "text": "Sydney Airport is experiencing delays for many flights, particularly arrivals, as gusty westerly winds sweep across the region.\n\nAccording to the airport\u2019s flight schedule, many arriving flights are delayed by 10 to 30 minutes, while departures are largely on time.\n\nAt 11.10am, winds reached near gale force at WSW 51.8km/h, with westerly gusts affecting the airport throughout the morning.\n\nStrong westerly winds reaching 51.8km/h are delaying flights into Sydney Airport. Picture: NewsWire / Gaye Gerard\n\nA Sydney Airport spokesperson said the weather had forced a runway change.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cDue to weather, Airservices Australia has shifted arriving and departing flights to Sydney Airport\u2019s east-west runway, which may cause some delays throughout the day,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to Sydney Airport, strong westerly winds can significantly impact operations.\n\nWhen wind gusts exceed 20 knots (about 37km/h), Airservices Australia moves flights from the dual north-south parallel runways to the single east-west runway.\n\nSingle runway operations are in place due to strong winds, reducing airport capacity. Picture: Christian Gilles / NewsWire\n\nThis process, known as \u201csingle runway operations\u201d, reduces the airport\u2019s capacity.\n\nFor example, if the schedule allows 70 movements per hour, 15-20 flights may need to be cancelled each hour while the winds persist. After delays, clearing the backlog is further limited by regulatory hourly movement caps.\n\nPassengers are encouraged to check with their airline regarding the status of their flight and allow extra time when travelling to Sydney Airport.",
