I understand why it is a younger person's game, because it's quite traumatic to the body giving birth,\" she explained.\n\n\"I wasn't allowed to do a home birth because of my age.\"\n\nThe medical anxiety was coupled with thoughts which made her question herself.\n\n\"Is this right?

What will that be like?'\"\n\nNow at 55 with a nine-year-old daughter, Walton knows exactly what it is like.\n\nAnd she said her age \ufeffhas only enriched her parenting.\n\n\"\ufeffI became a happier, balanced, emotionally stable human being,\" Walton said.\n\n\"And that's why I say, when the student is ready, the teacher arrives.\"\n\nSeaway Counselling and Psychotherapy's Julie Sweet.

I feel ready.

My inner world feels more stable. My gratitude is deeper.\"\n\nSweet said she believes there is a cultural shift away from the nuclear version of motherhood.\n\nThrough her work, she\ufeff is seeing more women choose to delay having children to their late 30s and 40s.\n\n\"Women are realising that traditional expectations \u2013 about age, career, and family - don't need to dictate their choices,\" Sweet added.\n\n\"From a therapeutic perspective, this shift is meaningful for mental health. Choosing to become a parent later often brings greater self-awareness, emotional resilience, and clarity of values, which can positively influence parenting and family dynamics.\n\n\"Of course, older parents may face unique anxieties \u2013 around energy, health, or longevity, yet these are often balanced by a profound sense of readiness and life experience.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nHe holds a Bachelor of International Relations and Public Policy from the University of Queensland and a TAFE Diploma of Travel and Tourism Management.\n\nHe is also about to graduate with a TAFE Diploma in Travel and Tourism.\n\nYet even these qualifications have not been enough to secure him a job, Kertesz told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous and it's scary,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm a week away from finishing a diploma of travel and tourism and I'm looking for any employment that is available.\"\n\nA casual job unloading containers at a Brisbane port last month received 6600 applications. (Supplied)\n\nKertesz said the hospitality jobs he was applying for regularly had hundreds of applicants, and entry-level jobs, which appealed to a broad range of people from different backgrounds, often got thousands of applications.\n\nLast month, Kertesz applied for a casual job with the Port of Brisbane, unloading containers at $38 per hour, with no experience necessary.\n\nHe said he was dismayed when he saw the number of people who had applied - 6600.\n\n\"When you don't have any money to your name, all you want to do is work,\" he said.\n\n\"But how are you going to get a job when there are thousands of people ahead of you?\"\ufeff\n\nHaving spent several years teaching English overseas, Kertesz returned to Australia in 2023 and said he had been applying steadily for jobs ever since.\n\nHowever, he never expected it to be so hard.\n\n\"The government say they've created jobs, and they probably have. But they don't understand how hard it is to obtain employment in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very, very difficult - it's become like winning the lottery.\"\n\nKertesz said he was often being told he did not have enough experience for a job, or he was too old.\n\n\"I've applied for well over 300 jobs (online). I've gone out and pounded the pavement, and I'm getting told you need experience, or they want younger people,\" he said.\n\nKertesz said he had also applied for jobs at Woolworths and Aldi supermarkets.\n\nHe recently had a job interview with Woolworths, which was conducted by an AI bot, a trend previously reported on by nine.com.au .\n\nHis application was unsuccessful.\n\n\"Some companies give you a first interview, but the interview is with a robot,\" he said.\n\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous. How can a robot determine if you'll be good at the job or not?\"\n\nAside from the Woolworths AI interview, he had only received one other offer of an interview during his current job search, Kertesz said.\n\n\"I dressed up and everything for the interview, and I got to the building about 20 minutes early, and then they called me, saying that they are sorry, they had changed their minds and already filled the position.\"\n\nUnemployed out of work for longer, report finds\n\nKertesz's experience comes as a new report was released from Anglicare yesterday, highlighting the grim reality jobseekers face while searching for entry-level positions which are disappearing.\n\nAnglicare Australia's Jobs Availability Snapshot 2025 found that the chances of job seekers finding entry-level work were so low that \"even the most determined will be left behind\".\n\nThe report compared the number of people receiving JobSeeker payments with the number of entry-level positions advertised in August this year.\n\nIt found that for every entry-level vacancy, there were 39 job seekers, up from last year's figure of 35.\n\nChambers said the findings show the need for urgent reform to the welfare system.\n\n\"All of this shows that people are being failed by a system that treats unemployment as a personal fault instead of a policy failure,\" she said.\n\n\"Taxpayers are spending billions of dollars on private employment providers whose business model depends on compliance and punishment.\n\n\"They profit whether or not people find work.\n\n\"Meanwhile, people are stuck in endless appointments and meaningless activities \u2014 all while competing for jobs that simply aren't there.\"\n\nThis month, Australia's unemployment rate was sitting at 4.3 per cent in October, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThat figure is down from 4.5 per cent in September.\n\nAustralia's unemployment rate hit a record low of 3.2 per cent in October 2022 and has been slowly climbing since then.",

(Reuters: Robert Galbraith)\n\nJust yesterday, US tech darling Nvidia announced an impressive set of third-quarter earnings.\n\nIts revenue of $US57 billion ($88 billion) beat expectations and lifted the gloom around stretched valuations on markets as investors look past concerns about AI spending.\n\nIts share price shot up about 5 per cent at the open of Wall Street trade, but then the metaphorical music stopped, and sellers swooped into the market.\n\nNvidia's decline in the market sparked a broader sell-off.\n\nIt's unclear what triggered the initial wave of selling.\n\nThere are concerns on Wall Street that major tech stocks could be over-valued. (Reuters: Eduardo Munoz/File Photo)\n\nABC News has spoken to a number of analysts who speak of \"profit taking\".\n\nThere are fears neither the Federal Reserve nor the Reserve Bank will offer up any more interest rate cuts, with stretched valuations for the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks on Wall Street.\n\n\"There are a lot of cross currents in asset markets currently, exasperated by approaching year end and risk reduction after a generally positive year,\" Jamieson Coote Bonds co-founder, Charlie Jamieson, said.\n\n\" The volatility of equity and crypto assets are reminding investors that markets are not a one-way bet. \"\n\nBitcoin has fallen by more than a quarter from its all-time peak in October.

Is it macro-economic concerns or less central bank support as rate cuts look delayed?\n\n\"Is it funding pressures in US markets or concerns about sustainability of Japan or some European debt bubbles?\n\n\"It's likely all of the above,\" he concluded.\n\nJapan is becoming a magnet for money\n\nUS President Donald Trump visited new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi last month. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein)\n\nMr Jamieson's bond trading desk in Sydney is firmly fixated on the Japanese bond market.\n\nSpecifically, the so-called carry trade.\n\nIn very simple terms, extremely low Japanese interest rates, for decades, have encouraged global investors to borrow yen, and invest that money in higher-yielding markets.\n\nThose low interest rates have also encouraged the Japanese to park much of their considerable savings offshore in the hope of getting a decent return.\n\nThe bull market on Wall Street \u2014 post the global financial crisis and interrupted by the COVID-19 emergency \u2014 has provided a sound destination for that money.\n\nJapanese investors are keen to bring their money back home, experts say. (AFP: Kazuhiro Nogi)\n\nUS Treasury bonds have also been viewed by those holding cheaply borrowed yen as an attractive place to earn a return of anywhere between 3 and 4 per cent.\n\nIndeed, there's almost $US1.1 trillion ($1.7 trillion) invested by Japan alone in the US bond market.\n\nJapan's first female PM In the world of male-dominated politics, Sanae Takaichi has broken through an incredibly tough glass ceiling.\n\n\"The Japanese yields are now at levels where Japanese investors prefer bringing their money back to Japan,\" Swissquote Bank senior analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya recently wrote.\n\nOvernight, the 10-year Japanese government bond yield hit its highest point since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nInvestors are concerned that the new Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, will overspend in her soon-to-be announced budget.\n\nThat would require a larger-than-expected sale of Japanese government bonds to fund the spending.\n\nAs bonds are sold, the prices of those bonds drop and the interest rate \u2014 or yield \u2014 increases.\n\nLoading...\n\nThese investments then become more attractive to say, for example, Wall Street traders who are concerned about the US stock market heading south or Japanese investors currently holding investments in US Treasury bonds.\n\n\"The 10-year Japanese government bond yield surpassed levels where borrowing yen and placing it in US Treasuries makes no money after taking FX hedging costs into account,\" Ms Ozkardeskaya said.\n\n\"As a result, the Japanese pension funds are reportedly pulling $1.1 trillion out of the US Treasuries right now \u2014 meaning that one of the biggest Treasury buyers is turning into a net seller.\n\n\"In plain English, the [Japanese] may be pulling the rug from under the US Treasury market \u2014 that also affects riskier investments like tech, EM stocks and crypto.\n\n\"So maybe we will simply blame the Japanese if the Bank of Japan [BoJ] dares hiking rates come December \u2026 and that Santa remains stuck somewhere where there's still snow this Xmas,\" she wrote.\n\nIceberg ahead\n\nOlder investors will be nervously checking their superannuation balances as markets dip. (ABC News: Claire Moodie)\n\nOf course, it's unclear where global financial markets will head from here.\n\nIf there is a prolonged share market wipe-out, millions of Australians in and approaching retirement will become increasingly concerned about their nest eggs.\n\nThere's more than $4 trillion in Australian super, and a sizeable chunk is riding on the recent success of Wall Street.\n\nDud super options 'could cost retirees up to $205,000' Superannuation products that fail the federal government's performance test are still offered to those already retired at a potentially huge cost, according to the consumer advocate.\n\nWe also know the Reserve Bank has had one eye out for a financial markets \"meltdown\" as RBA governor Michele Bullock recently put it.\n\nA meltdown would give the central bank a compelling reason to consider resuming interest rate cuts.\n\n\"All of a sudden, there are risks, whilst market positions are still very heavily skewed toward pro-risk outcomes,\" Mr Jamieson said.\n\nThe usually sanguine stockbroking veteran Marcus Padley is sitting a little more upright at his desk today.\n\n\"US markets still falling in after-market trade (hmmm\u2026)\u2026 feeling a little precipitous,\" Mr Padley wrote to his newsletter Marcus Today subscribers.\n\n\"Buying the dip has become a dangerous sport.",

        "text": "As much as he won't admit it, the well has never fully run dry for Paul Kelly.\n\nAt 70 years old, he's still writing songs, sketching out vivid scenes with his poetic, storybook lyricism and well-worn guitar, and introducing himself again to a younger audience with his long-awaited return to triple j's Like A Version.\n\nKelly has surfaced in the Like A Version studio a few times over the segment's 21-year history.\n\nFirst it was in 2007, covering Amy Winehouse's breakthrough hit Rehab, with just his guitar and a microphone \u2014 no cameras, no frills.\n\nIn 2016, he returned with A.B. Original \u2014 the hip-hop duo comprising of Yorta Yorta man Briggs and Ngarrindjeri man Trials \u2014 as they covered his original song Dumb Things, and furthered his long history of collaborating with Indigenous Australian musicians.\n\nNearly 20 years after his first Like A Version, Kelly \u2014 with a full band this time \u2014 entered the LAV studio again. This time, like his original Amy Winehouse moment, he takes inspiration from yet another powerful femme voice: Kylie Minogue.\n\nLoading...\n\nTaken from Kylie's 1997 album Impossible Princess, Did It Again is Australia's seminal pop queen with a grittier edge, shortly before her iconic golden hot pants moment.\n\nPaul Kelly (in full length trousers) turns the track into a rollicking sing-along, one that invokes infectious and subconscious head-bobbing and toe-tapping.\n\n\"I'm a Kylie Minogue fan. Who isn't?\" Kelly said about the cover.\n\n\"I like the lyrics but musically I thought it was really strong, I thought it would really suit the band. So that's why we chose it. It's got a great sort of gear change and we just love playing it.\"\n\nKeeping his cover in the same key as the original, Kelly infused the track with his signature cadence, warmth and wry smile. There's no doubt he and his band were there to simply have fun.\n\nThe music video for Did It Again featured Minogue battling various personas of herself, namely Cute Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie and Indie Kylie. (Supplied: YouTube)\n\nHow To Make Longevity\n\nSo, what's the secret sauce for Kelly's long and storied career, which has no sign of slowing down?\n\nIt lies in the people around him \u2014 his band. People he's been performing with for more than three decades, in some cases.\n\n\"We sort of get along really well, we're not sick of each other, so going out on tour is always fun,\" Kelly told triple j Breakfast's Concetta and Luka.\n\n\"As far as writing stuff, you know, I just write songs one by one.\n\n\"And so long as they keep coming, when I've gotten enough, I go and record them and then go and play them.\n\nPaul Kelly's Take 5 As the 70-year-old songwriter prepares his 30th album, he talks about the music that has driven him creatively.\n\n\"It's pretty simple, really.\"\n\nOutside of playing shows, Kelly said they filled all the time \"waiting around\" as a band with activities and sharing stories that they've heard millions of times.\n\n\"We're all pretty sporty,\" he said.\n\n\"So, there's couple of runners in the band; there's a few swimmers. I'm a swimmer. Four of us play tennis, so we try to get on a tennis court, and there's a few of us who don't drink anymore.\n\n\"Well, I do, but we're about half and half split now.\"\n\nHe prefers to swim in the ocean and mixes it up between freestyle and breaststroke, for what it's worth.\n\nLoading...\n\nPaul Kelly recognises Kylie Minogue as \"unstoppable\"; a force of creative and experimental nature that never seems to go away.\n\nWe could say the same about him \u2014 he's just released Seventy, his 30th studio album.\n\nThe record, released following a sold-out arena tour, was led by the single Rita Wrote A Letter, a black comedy follow-up to beloved Christmas hit How To Make Gravy, released some 30 years later.\n\nSafe to say, he did it again.",

I'm proud to get that first goal and get the momentum going.\"\n\nCarpenter's goal gave Chelsea \u2014 which chose to rest Matildas great Sam Kerr from the match \u2014 a 1-0 lead, but Barcelona equalised via an Ewa Pajor goal eight minutes later.\n\nA late shot on goal from Carpenter went wide, and the match ended in a stalemate.\n\n\"It's a little disappointing, I think we deserved to win that game, we had chances we could have converted,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm very proud of the team performance. We stuck to the game plan and brought it to Barcelona.\n\n\"We showed what this team is capable of when we are really playing our roles. I'm proud for the point but disappointed we didn't get three.\"\n\nThe result has Chelsea sixth out of 18 teams in the league phase of the competition.\n\nChelsea next faces Roma and Wolfsburg as it chases a top-four berth, which will guarantee automatic qualification for the quarterfinals.\n\nBarcelona leads the standings with three wins and a draw from its four matches.",

        "text": "A national recall of 32 coloured sand products that may contain asbestos has highlighted cracks in the system to remove these items from mass online marketplaces, according to one of Australia's leading specialists on artificial intelligence.\n\nA seller had the \"14 Piece Sand Castle Building Set\" listed on eBay Australia on Wednesday \u2014 three days after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had issued a national recall for the Active Sandtub \"14 piece Sand Castle Building Set\" sold in Kmart and Target.\n\nThis \"14 Piece Sand Castle Building Set\" was for sale on eBay days after a recall was issued for a four-colour \"Active Sandtub 14 piece Sand Castle Building Set\" sold at Kmart and Target. (eBay Australia)\n\nWhen the ABC alerted eBay Australia to the listing, the item was removed.\n\neBay Australia only removed the product listing hours after being contacted by the ABC. (eBay Australia)\n\nAn eBay Australia spokesperson said the platform used artificial intelligence to stay informed of product recalls and to flag items listed for sale that might be subject to any ACCC notice so that they could be removed.\n\n\"Our AI tools proactively monitor and take action on product-safety alerts and recalls published in databases around the world \u2026 so we can swiftly enforce product safety measures,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to the ABC. \"This proactive approach enabled us to identify three product recalls for asbestos-contaminated coloured and decorative sand items, and our security team conducted global sweeps and removals in response. \"We use a combination of block-filter algorithms for unsafe items and AI-supported monitoring by in-house specialists.\"\n\nProfessor Toby Walsh, the chief scientist at the University of NSW's AI Institute, told the ABC that retailers using artificial intelligence to monitor product recalls and control their sales output presented a risk.\n\n\"eBay don't have a full understanding of exactly what they're selling \u2014 things are listed under different names in different categories,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"It's a quite hard problem for them, even if they know a particular product has been recalled and is dangerous and there's a notice out on it \u2026 to connect that with the items that are actually listed for sale in their databases.\"\n\nThe eBay website allows individuals and retailers to sell items to customers who either pay a fixed price or enter into an online auction.\n\nSellers create their own item descriptions and there is no requirement for them to list identifying product codes, which are used by regulators in recall notices.\n\nThe ABC also sent a series of questions to Amazon, Temu, and Shein, requesting details about their efforts to ensure the recalled products were not for sale on their platforms.\n\nOnly Temu and Shein had responded by the time of publication. A Temu spokesperson said the website did not sell \"the specific coloured sand product subject to the ACCC recall\" and that a review of similar items was underway.\n\n\"Temu does not allow products containing asbestos. Sellers must follow our platform rules and comply with all applicable laws and regulations,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"When a potentially non-compliant item is identified, we remove it immediately and take appropriate action.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Shein also said it did not sell the ACCC-recalled products, but similar sand items are being removed from circulation \"out of an abudance of caution\".\n\nAsbestos sand contamination a fluke discovery in a lab An Australian lab discovered asbestos in children's play sand by chance and regulators only found out about it because of a podcast interview, the ABC can reveal.\n\nIn the past week the ACCC has issued multiple recall notices for coloured sand products made in China over asbestos contamination concerns.\n\nOn Tuesday the ABC revealed that asbestos in the children's play items was only discovered by chance in an Australian laboratory that conducted sample examinations for staff training and machine testing.\n\nProduct testing has since detected traces of asbestos \u2014 tremolite and chrysotile \u2014 in different batches of the sand.\n\nAuthorities determined that because they were in states that were unlikely to form fibres they were considered \"very low-risk\".\n\nThe recall has seen dozens of schools closed in recent days and schools in the ACT, South Australia and Tasmania will remain closed this week.\n\nDozens of schools across the country were closed for deep cleaning and the removal of sand products after the recall was issued. (ABC News: Mark Moore)\n\nSouth Australian Education Minister Blair Boyer has called for a national inquiry into how the products were imported into Australia.\n\nFederal Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth said the Home Affairs Department would treat \"any imported kinetic sand\" shipped into Australia as high risk.\n\nThe ACCC said it was working with \"online marketplaces\" to enforce the recalls.\n\n\"The ACCC has engaged with online marketplaces to advise them of the recalls, ask that they ensure the products are not listed for sale, conduct a risk assessment regarding these types of products more generally and contact consumers that purchased these products to notify them that they have been recalled,\" an ACCC spokesperson said in a statement to the ABC. \"The ACCC urges businesses to check if they are affected by the current recalls, noting this information may be updated. \"If a business sells a consumer good after it has been voluntarily recalled, it may have engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. Fines and penalties apply for breaches of the [Australian Consumer Law].\"\n\nProfessor Walsh said the size of major retail platforms such as eBay and Amazon made it more difficult for product control on their websites.\n\n\"If you're a small company with an online presence selling stuff online, you can look through your own catalogue. With Amazon and eBay, there are too many products, too many listings for them to have human eyes look at what they're doing,\" he said.\n\n\"They're completely dependent on the accuracy of the AI to spot the products for them.\n\n\" Given that things are falling between the cracks, you do have to ask the question whether they put enough effort into making the AI accurate enough. \"\n\nWhat to know about the coloured sand recall Fifteen public schools in Canberra are closed today, and several others are partially closed, due to potential asbestos contamination in coloured sand sold at dozens of stores across Australia. Here is what we know.\n\nThe eBay Australia spokesperson said measures taken to remove products flagged by its internal AI systems needed to be periodically reviewed.\n\nThe ACCC said it advised businesses against only using AI to act on product safety concerns.\n\n\"Online marketplaces and retailers should not rely only on AI tools to identify unsafe products,\" a spokesperson told the ABC.\n\n\"The ACCC has encouraged online marketplaces who are signatories to the Australian Product Safety Pledge to investigate new technologies, including AI, to improve how they monitor for unsafe products and remove listings.\"",

        "text": "There is an old adage in sport \u2014 with injury comes opportunity and this season Melbourne has proven it to be so.\n\nThe Demons' months of pain in 2024, where every ounce was squeezed out of an aching playing group, can now be looked upon fondly as the club returns to a preliminary final this weekend, its fourth across 10 AFLW seasons.\n\nIts ninth-place finish last year, with six wins from 11 games, was the club's poorest ever return.\n\nMelbourne has come back to life this season to earn a preliminary final berth. (Getty Images: Michael Willson)\n\nMelbourne suffered its greatest ever loss, and averaged its second-lowest score throughout 2024 \u2014 two signals of just how far it had fallen from the lofty standards it set for itself.\n\nOther clubs might only dream of a bad season still resulting in a near-miss when it comes to finals, but for the ever-achieving Demons it was a low ebb.\n\nMelbourne's dangerous game style has over time been built on utilising handballs to clear congestion and slickly move the ball into space. Last year, as things became particularly tough, the Demons started to resort to territory-gaining kicks rather than the neat movement for which it was known.\n\nPersonnel problem solved\n\nPlayer availability was the first domino in the Demons' issues last year. Tayla Harris played less than one game before a shoulder injury ended her season.\n\nLiv Purcell copped severe facial fractures in a preseason match, keeping her on the sidelines until the final month of play.\n\nOther crucial players like Kate Hore, Lauren Pearce, Blaithin Mackin, Eliza McNamara and Sinead Goldrick missed footy with a litany of their own concerns.\n\nThe club was already going to be thin on the ground, with significant player movement across the preceding trade period meaning premiership players Eliza West, Libby Birch, Maddi Gay and Casey Sherriff all departed.\n\nThe Demons were up against it for much of the 2024 season. (Getty Images: AFL Photos/Albert Perez)\n\nBut it all meant that others were given the opportunity to fast-track growth they otherwise would not have been afforded.\n\nEliza McNamara \u2014 a lightly framed winger \u2014 became a more reliable contested ball player purely out of necessity. Shelley Heath made a permanent move to the midfield, offering speed and defensive coverage through the line.\n\nMegan Fitzsimon made her presence known as a hard-working forward/midfield rotation and Ryleigh Wotherspoon added a mid-sized option in attack.\n\nIn an ideal world, these pieces of adjustment would have happened in phases, rather than all at once. But now, after having its hand forced, Melbourne is benefiting.\n\nA return to style\n\nAfter straying away from its reasonably balanced handball to kick ratio in 2024, Melbourne has re-established its brand this year. Despite having been challenged with injury once more, it has been far more adept at covering absences.\n\n2024 2025 Differential Avg. Disposals 235.2 273 +37.8 % of Disposals as Handballs 41.1 42.9 +1.8 Avg. Inside 50s 31.7 41.1 +9.4\n\nThe club is getting its hands on the ball more reliably this year and using its handballing game to exit the contest before launching forward. It was a style on show throughout its qualifying final win over Adelaide, and one that made it particularly difficult to defend.\n\nMelbourne uses layers at stoppage to methodically think its way out, largely relying on the in-tight work of Tyla Hanks, Kate Hore, and ruck Lauren Pearce. Heath and McNamara are now reliably part of the next layer out, then the likes of Paxy Paxman, Maeve Chaplin, and Sinead Goldrick propel out of the defensive half to then become the launchpad into attack.\n\nThe rest of the Demons' game falls into place around those contested layers.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWhen these layers collapse in \u2014 something that has still reared its head in moments of panic this year \u2014 there is a vulnerability in the defensive line that can be exploited, but at its best, Melbourne's intricate extraction is a sight to behold.\n\nNow, back in a preliminary final, it must face the toughest task in footy in the North Melbourne steam train. The Roos' midfield is packed with stars, and they are on an industry-record-winning streak of 25 games \u2014 which began against the Demons back in week three last year \u2014 but Melbourne must trust in its system.\n\nWinning the ball at the contest, not being overawed by the opposition, and remaining disciplined in positioning will all be key to challenging the Roos.\n\nAnd, importantly, leaning on the experience that last year's challenges pumped into its role players across the field will give the Demons' their best hope at toppling the AFLW's best.",

(ABC News: Bill Ormonde)\n\nFor Broken Hill-based Ironman World Championship competitor Bella Kolianc, who competed in Hawaii last month, it was special to see such an accomplished athlete in her hometown.\n\n\"It's pretty inspirational actually just seeing him out here in a small community. It's very motivating,\" she said.\n\nChalmers, who grew up in Port Lincoln in regional South Australia, said he \"loves nothing more\" than coming back to country towns.\n\n\"I think the people are so much more friendly and nicer out here so I love it, and hopefully we can discover the next great Australian swimmer from Broken Hill,\" he said.\n\nSwimmers exit the water at Lake Pamamaroo after the race. (ABC News: Bill Ormonde)\n\nA 'strong message'\n\nBut Chalmers' visit to the Menindee Lakes, and his various speaking events, was about more than his successful swimming career.\n\nPartnering with Lifeline and their outback How's Ya Mate campaign, Chalmers came out to discuss mental health.\n\n\"Especially men struggle to say how they're really going,\" he said.\n\n\"Promoting something that's really near and dear to my heart makes a lot of sense to me.\n\n\" So, for me, I feel it's really important to actually speak up and let people know how I'm going, and secondly ask the question of how my friends are going. \"\n\nSince beginning in Broken Hill in 2016, the How's Ya Mate program has worked with local sporting teams to promote open conversations around mental health and then, secondly, how to manage if someone is not OK.\n\n\"We're small communities and we lean on each other. Our clubs are like our families often,\" Lifeline project coordinator Jacinta Cullen said.\n\nJacinta Cullen says people in regional communities \"lean on each other\". (ABC News: BIll Ormonde)\n\nFor Ms Cullen, the ability of children to connect with icons and hear about their vulnerabilities was important.\n\n\"Kids look up to these sporting icons and legends and just think \u2026 [they've] potentially had it easy,\" she said.\n\n\"To hear from Kyle, and other people that we've brought up in the past, that they've actually really gone through some tough times \u2026 sends that really strong message to kids to push through and to ask for help, to get help.\n\n\"These guys that they all look up to, that's exactly what they do.

That was the cherry on top.\n\n\"Since leaving Montpellier, my friend and I have spoken about that moment a few times.\n\n\"Not receiving flowers was one thing, but as two of only six black girls in the squad, receiving bananas wasn't something I could laugh off and forget about.\"\n\nMary Fowler (right) joined Manchester City after departing Montpellier. (Getty Images: Jess Hornby/FA)\n\nMontpellier's statement offered a different version of events.\n\n\"From a purely factual standpoint, the truth leaves no room for interpretation,\" the statement read.\n\n\"On June 1, 2022, the women's team played their last home match against Bordeaux.\n\n\"At the end of the match, as had been customary for several seasons, two players whose contracts were expiring \u2014 and who were therefore wearing the club's colours for the last time \u2014 were honoured with a bouquet of flowers.\n\n\"This was neither the case for Mary Fowler nor for the teammate mentioned in her book, both of whom were still under contract with the club until June 30, 2023.\n\n\"It would therefore have been rather inappropriate for the club to offer them a farewell gift.\"\n\nRegarding the alleged events inside the dressing room, Montpellier said it consulted those present that day and concluded there was no evidence to support Fowler's account.\n\n\"If incidents of this nature had been reported and proven, the club would have taken all necessary measures as soon as they were brought to its attention,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Racism is a serious issue that must not be exploited. The club wishes to reiterate its daily commitment to fighting all forms of discrimination.\"\n\nFowler also wrote in her memoir that she experienced mental health challenges while at Montpellier.\n\nMatildas coach Joe Montemurro, speaking in Sydney on Friday, said Fowler had displayed emotional strength to write about her experiences in the book.\n\n\"I just applaud Mary. Absolutely courageous to come out and talk about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a great example of what needs to be done if these things do happen.\"\n\nMontemurro said he had recently been in contact with the injured Fowler, although it was to discuss football matters.\n\n\"I've had a few messages from her and we've just spoken about football and going forward,\" he said.\n\nAP",

        "text": "But even Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King has said Woodside was partly to blame for the years-long process. We\u2019re also hearing constant talk about the need to fast-track development of critical minerals and rare earth resources to drive our renewables future. However, the critical minerals deal struck between Australia and the US last month highlights that government funding and trade agreements are increasingly focused on defence, not the energy transition that was pitched to Australians ahead of the election. In WA, we see a proposal to extract gallium from tailings at Alcoa\u2019s Wagerup refinery. We would expect that any such proposal would go through a rigorous environmental assessment process, but the current narrative around fast-tracking projects of \u201cnational significance\u201d could see a further dismantling of our national environment laws. Mining has costs for our environment and communities, and CCWA is well aware of the need to access minerals for renewables. But it\u2019s a different proposition altogether to further degrade our environment to fuel defence measures, without having an honest conversation with the community.\n\nOften, we see conversations framed around deregulation and the impossible challenges of \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d tape. What is missing from this conversation is a true account of the crisis nature is in, right across this state. Loading WA is home to eight of Australia\u2019s 15 biodiversity hotspots, and it contains between 600,000\u2013700,000 native species, many found nowhere else in the world. Across WA, 65 Threatened Ecological Communities are formally listed as such under the Biodiversity Conservation Act, with a further 390 identified as likely to be threatened and are a priority for listing. The toll is alarming. The Pilbara, one of the most prosperous regions in the country, has been developed at a significant cost.\n\nAlcoa\u2019s impact from strip-mining of our Northern Jarrah Forest has put precious flora and fauna on the brink of extinction, compounded due to climate change. As a movement, we have worked to elevate our concerns for nature, so they can be adequately accounted for in the planning of future projects in WA. Nature is well behind the eight-ball when it comes to industry, and industry-first rhetoric only reinforces that reality. While there is an argument for removing duplication in project approvals at a state and federal level, there is the dark art of using this as an excuse to compromise the entire process. Environment groups are not opposed to efficiency but what we want, and what the environment needs, is decision-making processes that ensure environmental protection.\n\nIn WA, we have a government hell-bent on passing a State Development Bill that, again, puts nature second to big business and industry. Loading It seeks to undermine the broad legislative outcomes we have agreed through parliament by creating a bill to rule over 40 pieces of existing legislation, including impacting the state Environmental Protection Act. Why would the federal government be handing over the assessment reigns to a state government that has shown scant regard for the protection of nature? In our political system, we have a dedicated resources minister. She does not consult heavily with environmental groups and makes no apologies in just backing the resources sector under her portfolio.",

        "text": "Their stories reveal both the extraordinary opportunity and the troubling brain drain facing Australia\u2019s tech sector. Andrew Tulloch: The billion-dollar brain Andrew Tulloch has left the AI start-up he co-founded to join Meta. If there is a face to the sheer financial madness of the 2025 AI talent wars, it is Andrew Tulloch. The man behind the $US1.5 billion headline is not a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d coder. Tulloch\u2019s background is one of pure, elite Australian academic achievement. Described by industry sources as shy and keen to retain a low profile, his resume speaks for itself. He graduated from one of Perth\u2019s most exclusive private schools, Christ Church Grammar, with the highest possible tertiary entrance rank (now ATAR) of 99.95 in 2007. He was school vice-captain, debating team captain, and a member of the first XI cricket and hockey teams. He studied at the University of Sydney, graduated in 2011 with first-class honours and a university medal in advanced mathematics. From there, he earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics and machine learning at Cambridge University.\n\nTulloch\u2019s staggering strategic value to Meta, however, comes from his first, 11-year stint at the company, which began after a brief period at Goldman Sachs in Sydney. At Meta (then Facebook), Tulloch was a pivotal engineer in the creation of PyTorch, the open-source AI framework Meta founded in 2016. PyTorch is not just a project at Meta, it underpins its entire AI strategy. It is the cornerstone upon which its research and production systems are built, and a key pillar of Zuckerberg\u2019s entire open-source AI philosophy. Loading In 2023, Tulloch left Meta. He did a stint at OpenAI before co-founding the start-up Thinking Machines Lab (TML) in February, alongside former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati. TML immediately became a formidable competitor, raising a staggering $US2 billion seed round at a $US12 billion valuation from investors including Andreessen Horowitz. Zuckerberg\u2019s pursuit of Tulloch was not merely an offensive move to gain a star researcher. It was a critical defensive manoeuvre to reclaim an irreplaceable asset and neutralise a profound competitive threat.\n\nMeta had reportedly tried to acquire TML outright to avoid losing ground in the AI race. When that failed, Zuckerberg personally targeted TML\u2019s key staff. Tulloch possessed deep, institutional knowledge of Meta\u2019s core AI engine and his role as co-founder of TML meant he was now using that expertise to build a next-generation competing system, backed by $US2 billion in investment. The $US1.5 billion offer (which, at the time, a Meta spokesperson said was \u201cinaccurate and ridiculous\u201d) was therefore not a \u201csalary\u201d in the traditional sense. It was a second attempt at an acquisition \u2013 this time, targeting the single human asset who built their engine, effectively neutralising the threat of him building a better one for a rival. While Tulloch initially declined the offer, the relentless campaign eventually succeeded. In late 2025, it was confirmed that Tulloch was leaving TML to rejoin Meta for an undisclosed, though undoubtedly massive, sum. Zuckerberg had, in effect, bought his engine-builder back. Sholto Douglas: The visionary at Anthropic Sholto Douglas never imagined working in AI when he was competing as one of the top 50 fencers in the world during his university years in Sydney.\n\nDespite applying to PhD programs in 2020 and being rejected, Douglas\u2019 independent research caught the attention of researchers at Google\u2019s AI research lab DeepMind, who recruited him on what he describes as \u201cthe most junior role that you could possibly be in\u201d \u2013 an L3 engineer with no track record. He arrived just a month before ChatGPT\u2019s release, when Google threw itself into panic mode.\u200b Anthropic researcher Sholto Douglas. \u201cThey took 1000 people and were like, \u2018Please figure out how to make a competitor to ChatGPT, your time starts now\u2019,\u201d Douglas says. \u201cThere was so much chaos and the field was so fresh that actually there was a lot of room for people to figure it out as you go along.\u201d \u200b Douglas is now a tech lead on Reinforcement Learning infrastructure at Anthropic, the AI lab founded by former OpenAI researchers that is now one of the primary contenders for the throne. He\u2019s working on \u201cscaling compute\u201d \u2013 effectively figuring out how to feed the AI more power and data to make it smarter. He describes the work as intense but deeply mission-driven. \u201cEveryone here is trying to bend the arc of history,\u201d he says. Douglas is coy about his own salary but is adamant that the reported numbers in the industry are real, as is the value that these researchers and engineers are delivering to their companies.\n\n\u201cCompanies are spending tens of billions of dollars on compute,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you figure out a way to make the model run 10 per cent more efficiently, you\u2019ve actually just saved billions of dollars ... The right people can make huge improvements.\u201d Douglas admits the poaching is relentless. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty CEO-driven,\u201d he says. Tech titans like Altman, Sergey Brin and Zuckerberg personally text and call researchers to recruit them. \u201cYou get a text from Sam [Altman] saying, \u2018Hey, would you like to chat?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re super nervous.\u201d Tristan Heywood: Making ChatGPT faster Douglas helped pull friend Tristan Heywood into the vortex. Heywood, an engineer who grew up in Sydney and was awarded the University Medal at the University of Sydney, watched from afar as Douglas landed a job at DeepMind.\n\nOpenAI researcher Tristan Heywood. \u201cIt really proved it was possible,\u201d Heywood says. He quit his job, spent three months intensely studying transformers and chatbots, and landed a role at OpenAI in January 2023, just as the ChatGPT craze was igniting. Heywood\u2019s job is tangible: he makes ChatGPT faster. As part of the inference team, he optimises the massive mathematical calculations required to generate text, ensuring the model can serve millions of users without melting down the GPU clusters. When asked about his salary, Heywood is straightforward: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, it is seven figures.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a wild stat,\u201d Douglas says of his friend\u2019s ascent. \u201cHe 10 times-ed his salary in a month.\u201d\n\nBut the money comes with a heavy psychological load. Heywood acknowledges the weight of working on technology that could reshape \u2013 or end \u2013 civilisation. \u201cIt is possible that, like, a real AGI [artificial general intelligence] could cause extinction of humanity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is kind of daunting that we have that responsibility.\u201d He worries about bad actors using the tech to develop bioweapons, a fear echoed by many in the safety-conscious corridors of OpenAI and Anthropic. Despite the existential dread, the thrill of the race is undeniable. Heywood\u2019s is a role that sits at the bleeding edge of human engineering. Ben Goodger: The architect of the internet If there is a singular architect of how humans experience the modern web, it is Ben Goodger. A New Zealander raised in Auckland, Goodger didn\u2019t just watch the browser wars of the past two decades; he won them.\n\nIn the late 1990s, while studying computer engineering at the University of Auckland, Goodger began sending code patches to Netscape, the dominant browser of the era. \u201cI got this ping on chat from one of the top engineers at Netscape saying, \u2018Do you want a job?\u2019\u201d he recalls. He accepted and moved to Mountain View for what was supposed to be a one-year internship. OpenAI executive Ben Goodger. He never really left the frontline. Goodger went on to ship the first version of Firefox in 2004, breaking Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the web. He moved to Google, where he was instrumental in creating Chrome, the browser that now runs the world. Eighteen months ago, he joined OpenAI to lead engineering on Atlas, a project that aims to do to the browser what ChatGPT did to search. \u201cIt puts ChatGPT at the heart of the browser,\u201d Goodger says of the new tool, which allows users to let the AI \u201cdrive\u201d their web experience rather than just retrieving information. He describes the shift as moving from a world of search queries to one where \u201chabits take over\u201d, allowing the AI to click around, fill out forms, and execute tasks on the user\u2019s behalf. Goodger compares the atmosphere at OpenAI to his early days at Google \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not the same, but it rhymes\u201d \u2013 describing a culture of enthusiasm to build and release products tempered by the heavy responsibility of serving 800 million weekly users.\n\nDespite his legendary status in Silicon Valley, Goodger says he retains the thick skin of an Antipodean expat. He dismisses the fervour around 10-figure compensation packages. \u201cI don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about crazy compensation packages,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m spending time with my team.\u201d He views the exodus of talent from Australia and New Zealand not as a crisis, but as a cultural trait. OpenAI\u2019s new AI browser Atlas. \u201cWe\u2019re explorers,\u201d he says of the Kiwi and Aussie diaspora. \u201cWe want to go out and see what the world\u2019s like ... it\u2019s just kind of a fact of life.\u201d While he notes the billboards in San Francisco are now exclusively advertising AI products, Goodger believes the tech scenes in Australia and New Zealand are richer than when he left 22 years ago. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t really care where you come from,\u201d he says. \u201cThe world wants to see what your idea is.\u201d Casey Flint: The AI strategist If Tulloch, Douglas, Goodger and Heywood are building the brains, Casey Flint is helping build the body. Raised in Winton, a rural Queensland town with a population of 800, Flint\u2019s journey to the C-suite of a frontier AI lab is perhaps the most unlikely of all.\n\n\u201cWe had a fly-in, fly-out doctor,\u201d she says of her childhood. \u201cWe were two hours away from the nearest IGA.\u201d Her story illustrates both the pull of Silicon Valley and what Australia risks losing.\u200b Growing up without permanent doctors, dentists or psychologists, Flint became fascinated with how technology could transform healthcare. That interest led to a biochemistry degree at the University of Queensland and eventually a six-year career at Uber, where she worked her way from intern to strategy roles spanning Brisbane, Sydney, Amsterdam, Japan and South Korea.\u200b Casey Flint was at Uber before joining Square Peg as an investment associate. Credit: AFR A pivot to venture capital at Square Peg gave Flint a front-row seat to Australia\u2019s AI ecosystem, and its limitations. She realised she wanted to be \u201cin the room when it happens\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d go to SF [San Francisco], I\u2019d have these conversations with researchers and founders here, and then I\u2019d come back and I\u2019d get pitched a concept that was like six to 12 months old by SF standards,\u201d she says. \u201cI found that a bit fatiguing, and really wanted to be at the very frontier.\u201d \u200b\n\nAfter a stint at Amazon Web Services focusing on AI investments, Flint joined ReflectionAI as chief of staff, working with former DeepMind and OpenAI researchers building what they describe as \u201csuperintelligence\u201d. The team recently launched Asimov, a code research agent for engineering teams.\u200b Flint worries about AI\u2019s economic implications for Australians like her family back in Winton. \u2018I come from a rural part of Australia \u2026 If you have all of this economic value and knowledge work basically being done overseas ... how are Australian businesses capturing value from that?\u2019 Casey Flint \u201cI come from a rural part of Australia,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are nearly enough people thinking about the economic implications. If you have all of this economic value and knowledge work basically being done overseas ... how are Australian businesses capturing value from that?\u201d She believes a new \u201cFAANG\u201d \u2013 comprising tech giants Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) \u2013 is emerging and is determined that \u201cReflection\u201d will one day form part of the acronym.\n\nJames Groeneveld: The rower who rebuilt the engine James Groeneveld was never meant to be fixing billion-dollar server stacks in Silicon Valley; he was supposed to be in a hospital ward back home. The Brisbane native headed to Harvard on a rowing scholarship with a clear, parental-approved plan: \u201cI\u2019d come back one day [as a] doctor, my mum would be happy, and everything would work out.\u201d That plan evaporated in his freshman year, derailed by a computer science course that left him enamoured with the power of code. Today, instead of hospital rounds, Groeneveld is dissecting the digital brains of Character.AI, one of the world\u2019s most heavily used consumer AI platforms. Character.AI chief intelligence officer James Groeneveld. Having cut his teeth at Google Brain managing the massive fleets of chips used to train early AI models, Groeneveld joined Character during a period of chaotic hyper-growth. His mandate sounds terrifying: rebuild the entire technological foundation of the company while millions of users were actively using it.\n\n\u201cWe were building the planes while flying,\u201d Groeneveld says of the six-month sprint to replace the prototype code written by brilliant \u2013 but commercially inexperienced \u2013 researchers. \u201cThey\u2019re brilliant mathematician types ... But not the best systems programmers building for scale.\u201d Groeneveld argues that the astronomical salaries defining his industry aren\u2019t just hype; they are a reflection of a sector where the rule book hasn\u2019t been written yet. He describes the industry as being at the \u201cvery beginning of the onion\u201d, lacking the established frameworks that exist in traditional web development. \u201cThere are no best practices, really,\u201d he says. Consequently, companies are forced to pay for the few engineers who understand the raw fundamentals of how these models interact with hardware. When a single training run costs $1 billion, the engineer who ensures it works is worth their weight in gold. \u201cTying the compensation to the outcome makes sense,\u201d Groeneveld says. \u201cIf one person can have that large of an economic outcome ... 2 per cent of that is nothing in the grand scheme of things.\u201d Despite his success in the US, Groeneveld remains a believer in the grit and determination of Australian talent. He points to rising stars such as the \u201cUnsloth\u201d brothers (Daniel and Michael Han), who began optimising AI models from a Sydney bedroom, as proof that Aussies are punching above their weight. For now, however, the centre of gravity remains in San Francisco, which is a long way from the rowing sheds of Brisbane.\n\nCan Australia and New Zealand compete? Should they try? The list of Australian AI leaders continues to grow. There is Joel Pobar, a veteran engineering leader who recently returned to Meta\u2019s superintelligence division after a stint at Anthropic. Clare Birch, a former quantum chemist and Blackbird investor, is now helping build the ecosystem at Mira Murati\u2019s Thinking Machines as chief of staff. And Ben Brooks, a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Centre, is shaping the global regulations that will govern these technologies. Joel Pobar is an Australian engineering leader who recently returned to Meta\u2019s superintelligence division after a stint at Anthropic. The consensus among the expatriates is clear: for now, the cutting edge is in San Francisco. You just have to be there. \u201cIt would be hard in Australia,\u201d Heywood says. \u201cOpenAI is ... very consequential. Everything they do is a lot more impactful.\u201d However, they believe Australia is not out of the game, provided it stops trying to build its own ChatGPT and starts playing to its strengths. \u201cAustralia is one of the best places in the world to build compute,\u201d Douglas says, citing the nation\u2019s solar capacity, stable rule of law and massive superannuation capital. \u201cThe world is going to be accelerator constrained for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nFlint echoes this \u201clower stack\u201d strategy. She believes Australia should become an energy and mineral superpower for the AI age, supplying the copper for the chips and the green energy for the data centres. \u201cWe need a lot of energy to power data centres ... Australia could become an energy superpower.\u201d Loading Heywood also has an idea for Australia, one that wouldn\u2019t necessarily stem the brain drain but might help maximise the benefits from AI. \u201cAustralia should ask American tech companies to release open-source models,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the [Australian] government is negotiating a big contract, they can push for that as part of negotiations. This would let Australian companies build on top of strong AI models, and also reduces the centralisation of the technology in the US.\u201d For now, though, the brain drain continues. San Francisco\u2019s pull \u2013 with its \u201cRenaissance\u201d vibe and its eye-watering compensation packages \u2013 is simply too strong.",

        "text": "What is Eminem\u2019s argument? Eminem objected to the trademark on several grounds. One argument is grounded in consumer law \u2013 that trading on the name Swim Shady could mislead or deceive customers into thinking they\u2019re buying a product associated with the rapper. In response, Swim Shady contends the two parties are in significantly different industries, and that a beach and lifestyle wear company in Australia is unlikely to be confused with the alter ego of a US rapper which was introduced in an EP in 1997. Eminem continues to sell official Slim Shady merchandise \u2013 one of several income streams that has built his net worth to a reported $US250 million. A Swim Shady beach umbrella Credit: Swim Shady\n\nEminem is also claiming the trademark should be refused because it was applied for in \u201cbad faith\u201d, pointing to the fact the business initially chose the name \u201cSlim Shade\u201d before \u201cSwim Shady\u201d. Jane Rawlings, barrister and acting director of Intellectual Property Program at the University of Technology Sydney\u2019s law faculty, said Eminem intervened promptly to protect his ability to use the trademark in the future. \u201cHe is saying, \u2018I\u2019m the real slim shady\u2019 and that the people behind Swim Shady are just imitating and could mislead the general public,\u201d Rawlings said. Crucially, Eminem did not have a trademark on the name \u201cSlim Shady\u201d in Australia at the time the Sydney business lodged its application for \u201cSwim Shady\u201d. This works against Eminem, said Olugbenga Olatunji, intellectual property and trademarks lecturer at the University of Sydney.\n\nJeremy Scott and Elizabeth Afrakoff are the husband and wife behind Swim Shady. Credit: Swim Shady \u201cThe way intellectual property works is it\u2019s the first in line that has the right, so Swim Shady would seem to have the stronger case on that point, because they filed their application first,\u201d Olatunji said. Instead, Eminem held trademarks for \u201cShady\u201d and \u201cShady Limited\u201d, but they have been the subject of non-use applications. In Australia, if there hasn\u2019t been genuine use of a trademark for three years and one month, there are grounds for removal. Eminem subsequently applied to trademark \u201cSlim Shady\u201d in Australia in January 2025. He also launched objections to Swim Shady\u2019s US and UK trademarks. Despite the dispute, the company was launched publicly and began selling products in December 2024.\n\nUltimately, because of the Madrid System for coordinating trademarks internationally, the Australian case could dictate the matter globally. Eminem performing at the Oscars in 2020. Credit: AP \u201cThe reason why Eminem is concentrating in Australia is because it\u2019s the root in which all other applications are made,\u201d Rawlings said. \u201cIf he can knock over Swim Shady\u2019s trademark here, all other applications overseas lose their priority.\u201d What\u2019s Katy Perry got to do with it? A key part of Eminem\u2019s argument is that while he may not hold a local trademark to \u201cSlim Shady\u201d, he does in the US, and that the US trademark has led to him acquiring a reputation in Australia. This is ground for opposing a trademark in Australia.\n\nLoading It is also the argument at the centre of another high-profile case. Since 2009, US singer Katy Perry has been fighting Australian clothing designer Katie Perry. The latter registered a trademark to sell clothing under the name Katie Perry in 2008, something which did not prevent the US artist from selling branded clothing when she toured Australia the next year. However, in 2019, Katie Perry launched legal action against the singer Katy Perry, whose birth name was Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, in Australia\u2019s Federal Court. The fashion designer alleged her trademark had been infringed when the singer had sold branded merchandise in Australia. The designer won the case but lost a subsequent appeal. The High Court will consider the reputation argument in what could force closure of the Australian Perry\u2019s clothing label. The verdict is also likely to set a precedent that will influence Eminem\u2019s case against Swim Shady, said Olatunji.\n\nKaty Perry in Australia in 2024. Credit: Eddie Jim \u201cAll of us are waiting on the High Court with bated breath as to whether general reputation is enough for famous artists,\u201d Olatunji said. \u201cIf it upholds [in favour of Katy Perry] then it\u2019s likely Eminem will prevail here too.\u201d Where to from here? Hearings are yet to be scheduled in either Australia or the US, but both sides are refusing to budge. \u201cIt\u2019s very much \u2018game on\u2019 on both sides of this,\u201d Rawlings said.",

As Gilmore and Moore return from two-year breaks, they are joined on the men\u2019s side by comebacks from Hawaiian three-time world champion John John Florence, and Brazil\u2019s Gabriel Medina (two titles), who has recovered from a torn pectoral. Generations collide: Molly Picklum, Carissa Moore and Stephanie Gilmore. Credit: Matt Willis It all makes for a perfect storm of 19 world titles returning to a WSL tour more aligned with surfing\u2019s traditional season structure. Gone is the controversial mid-season cut that Gilmore almost fell foul of in May 2022, a campaign which ended with the most remarkable of her eight world titles.\n\nThe one-day, winner-takes-all final five format also hits the bricks, with the 2026 world champion to be crowned once more based on cumulative points accrued across the entire season. Despite her stunning 2022 triumph running the field from fifth place, and knocking off that year\u2019s first-place finisher Moore, Gilmore summed up the thoughts of most surfers on the finals format in the hours after lifting her trophy. Stephanie Gilmore celebrates her record eighth world title in 2022. Credit: Beatriz Ryder/World Surf League \u201cCarissa in my mind is the real world champ this year,\u201d Gilmore said at the time. \u201cShe had such a stellar year. She had so many wonderful performances. I disliked this format, to be honest.\n\n\u201cI was like, the world champion should be crowned in all the different waves over the entire \u00adperiod of the year. Now [after winning the final from fifth-place] I love it.\u201d Moore\u2019s two runner-up finishes to Gilmore (2022) and Marks in 2023 despite dominating all season were held up by many as cause enough to ditch the finals format, though the Hawaiian has always been typically gracious about being beaten on the day. The 2026 format sets up an especially enticing season, with a historic world title crowning regardless of who wins it. For the first time, the world title will be crowned in the final event at Hawaii\u2019s Pipeline - as it was in the men\u2019s competition for years, but never the women\u2019s. The wave was long deemed too dangerous for the girls.\n\nPicklum, Simmers and a slew of the world\u2019s best women have smashed that perception, and now the iconic break shapes as pivotal to the 2026 championship, given a win there is worth 1.5 times a victory anywhere else. For Gilmore and Moore, the 2026 circuit could be tailor-made with an April kick-off at Bells Beach, followed by Margaret River and the Gold Coast. Stephanie Gilmore: one of the smoothest surfers in history. Credit: Pat Nolan/World Surf League Picklum, Simmers and Tyler Wright are all strong at Bells, but Gilmore is on another level - her four Bells triumphs sit behind only local icon Gail Couper\u2019s record 10 wins in the 60s and 70s. Gilmore is even better in her own backyard at Snapper Rocks. Again, no-one comes close to her six event wins from 18 appearances.\n\nHow the veterans return is the unknown, but history says Gilmore and Moore (eight wins herself across the three Australian events) could leave these shores well in the title race. Both have had previous wins at 2026 tour stops in Brazil, South Africa and California, with Gilmore also prevailing in El Salvador and Moore winning two competitions of the four contests held in wave pools. Locations in surfing are a bit like tennis grand slam surfaces and foreign pitches in cricket - a variety of waves play to certain surfing strengths and weaknesses. In announcing her comeback, Gilmore noted the tour\u2019s heaviest waves - Teahupo\u2019o (Tahiti), Cloudbreak (Fiji) and Pipeline - are \u201clocations where I don\u2019t have great results\u201d. To be fair, she\u2019s rarely competed at them because the tour just didn\u2019t stop there for women for so long.",

        "text": "Virgin Australia and Qantas are the latest airlines to restrict the use of power banks on planes after a spate of in-flight battery fires globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nVirgin Australia's new policy will come into effect on 1 December. Passengers will no longer be allowed to use power banks to charge other devices on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nPortable battery packs must also be kept within sight and easily accessible throughout the flight, meaning they should not be stored in overhead lockers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a limit of two power banks per person, with devices over 100 watt-hours requiring airline approval. Power banks exceeding 160 watt-hours will be prohibited.\n\n\n\n\n\nQantas and its subsidiary Jetstar will implement similar restrictions from 15 December.\n\n\n\nAt present, many airlines allow power banks in the cabin but not in checked bags due to the risk they could catch fire while unattended in the cargo hold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, various carriers including Emirates, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines have also moved to restrict the use of power banks in flight due to the risk of lithium batteries overheating and igniting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as passengers are increasingly travelling with power banks and other lithium-powered devices. An International Air Transport Association survey found that 44 per cent of passengers travel with a power bank, 83 per cent carry a phone and 60 per cent carry a laptop.\n\n\n\nPhones and laptops also use lithium batteries. Why are power banks the big concern?\n\nLithium-ion batteries can be highly flammable if manufactured incorrectly, stored inappropriately or damaged.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Neeraj Sharma, a professor at the University of New South Wales' chemistry school, there's less quality control around power banks compared to phones and laptops, which typically come from more established brands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's been extensive testing of the batteries that go inside products from major tech companies such Apple and Samsung, he noted, but this may not be the case for products from some other brands.\n\n\n\nQantas and Virgin Australia join a host of other carriers blocking the use of power banks on board. Source: AAP / Paul Miller Wesley Dose, a battery researcher and senior lecturer in the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, said: \"Some lower quality, cheaper devices have fewer safeguards, which comes with an increased risk of an incident involving these products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Another reason behind some incidents involving batteries is improper handling and use, such as using the wrong charger or damaging the device.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned consumers in July there was a growing list of defective power banks that were at risk of overheating and catching fire.\n\n\n\nVirgin pledged to review its onboard battery policy after a fire, believed to have been caused by a power bank, broke out in an overhead locker on a flight from Sydney to Hobart in July. The plane landed safely and no injuries were reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nA faulty power bank was also the likely culprit of a fire in the overhead luggage compartment of an Air Busan plane in South Korea earlier this year, which severely damaged the aircraft and injured seven people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plane was preparing to take off from Busan's international airport for a flight to Hong Kong when the fire started.\n\n\n\nIs a power bank likely to catch fire on a plane?\n\nThe concern about power banks on flights is rooted largely in the fact that an aircraft is a far more dangerous environment for a potential fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile battery fires are rare, the consequences can be quite severe, Dose explained, as they are difficult to put out and can release toxic gases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"... the main challenge is that the potential consequences of an incident on a plane, especially while in flight, are more severe than other situations.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australians are obsessed with Japan, but a new travel hotspot is emerging\n\nWhile battery fires are rare, the consequences can be quite severe, Dose explained, as they are difficult to put out and can release toxic gases.\n\n\n\nWhy do lithium batteries catch fire?\n\nLithium-ion batteries are energy-dense; they store a lot of energy in a small space. If something goes wrong inside, that energy can be released suddenly as heat \u2014 in some cases, in the form of a fire or explosion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Batteries can sometimes catch on fire because they enter 'thermal runaway', where the temperature of the battery increases uncontrollably,\" Dose explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This can happen for various reasons, including physical damage, exposure to heat, overcharging, and manufacturing defects.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of lithium batteries, when manufactured appropriately, are safe, according to the experts.\n\n\n\nThe risk increases with manufacturing defects, damage from dropping or crushing, cheap or poorly made batteries, overcharging or incorrect storage.\n\n\n\nHow do I safely use power banks?\n\nCheaper power banks can often fail to include safeguards that prevent overcharging and overheating. Sharma recommends sticking with reputable suppliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also important to be wary that damage to a battery pack can significantly increase the risks.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with a properly manufactured power bank, if you drop it and notice a dent, you should consider disposing of it, Sharma said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taking responsibility of and looking after your batteries is important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey should also be stored in a cool place, and you should unplug them once charged.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not advised to charge a power bank overnight.\n\n\n\n",

and supplies.\n\nA childhood development expert says a lack of food or essential items can impact a child for life.\n\nOverwhelmed charities say more Australian children could be dropping out of school as poverty-induced meal-skipping hits a growing number of families.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood relief charity OzHarvest has been running for 21 years, but says 2025 is the worst on record when it comes to food insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW state manager Richard Watson told SBS News that meeting growing demand is a \"daily challenge\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Food insecurity in Australia is often overlooked \u2014 we describe it as a hidden crisis that is affecting so many families right now,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Children are arriving at school tired and unfocused, families are stressed about how to stretch their budgets, and others [are] going without because they're prioritising other bills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOzHarvest delivers more than 700,000 meals across Australia to 1,550 charities, many of which are \"stretched to their limits\", Watson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our latest Community Needs Survey revealed a 54 per cent increase in people being turned away from charity doors, as frontline organisations struggle to meet the ongoing high demand.\"\n\n\n\n'Demand so high' some schools turned away\n\nA key sector accessing food relief is educational institutions, with OzHarvest working with 245 schools, TAFEs and colleges across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne program providing food relief for students is called Nourishing Schools, and it's organised separately through OzHarvest Western Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program's coordinator, Tim James, works with volunteers to pack 280 hampers each week as demand for the program grows in Perth and regional WA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We started off at about 24 schools and then the demand is so high, we've got more and more schools wanting to come on board,\" he told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Through the Nourishing Schools program, OzHarvest supplies fresh groceries and healthy snacks to schools for breakfasts and lunches, and also delivers pantry items for families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program supports over 140 schools, with many others being added to a waitlist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We try not to turn schools away, but we do have schools that are applying more recently that we just say: 'I'm sorry, we just don't have capacity, if we have the opportunity, then we'll get back to you',\" James said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The waiting list is growing, and we don't have great options in the immediate future of how we're able to include more schools.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile food security is a national challenge, Watson said it's most acutely felt in low-income and regional areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These schools often rely on food relief to ensure their students have access to regular, nutritious meals both at school and in the form of hampers to provide much-needed food for their household\", he said.\n\n\n\nChildren missing more than just meals\n\nDoug Taylor, CEO of The Smith Family, said more and more schools are trying to provide core support to students through meals and supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national children's education charity supports 73,000 disadvantaged students across Australia in 800 schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent foundation survey of these children's families found 60 per cent of parents found it hard to afford essential school items this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are increasing costs for school items, excursions and books and school uniforms, all of which are really important,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We often underestimate how important it is to have a school uniform like your peers in terms of being a part of the school community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor also said a \"new frontier of poverty\" is creating disadvantage in the classroom, as around 44 per cent of disadvantaged students don't have access to laptops at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many schools these days will have bring-your-own-device policies, which is great for young people's learning, but it's really challenging for families that don't have access.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor explained that poverty and disadvantage can also increase absenteeism and contribute to children dropping out of school.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Foodbank Australia CEO Kylea Tink SBS News 08:27 English\n\n\"Our school completion rate is at a historic low,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While some of that has to do with COVID-19, there are factors like mental wellbeing and disadvantage also contributing to that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nData from NAPLAN results show that a young person who experiences disadvantage \u2014 \"not having access to those educational essentials\" \u2014 can be four to five years behind their peers in literacy and numeracy, he added.\n\n\n\nImportance of nutrition, school supplies\n\nDr Hannah Kirk, a developmental psychologist and senior lecturer at Monash University, said children need \"adequate nutrition\" to maintain brain health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The brain uses a huge amount of the body's energy and needs to be fuelled accordingly,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Skipping meals leads to reduced glucose availability and can impact neural systems that support key cognitive processes such as attention and working memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without these foundational skills that allow us to concentrate and remember information, it is very challenging to acquire new knowledge and skills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk explained that being hungry at school can cause irritability and dysregulation that impacts classroom engagement.\n\n\n\n\"Nutritional inadequacies are associated with increased illness, poorer sleep, and reduced physical exercise, all aspects that can contribute to poorer development and increased school absence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA lack of supplies can also lead to social exclusion and reduced self-esteem as children may feel embarrassed or different, which can lead to social withdrawal and reduced \"socio-emotional development\".\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk said that educational engagement plays a \"huge role\" in children's developmental trajectories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Early disengagement from schools can lead to reduced skill development and restrict later employment opportunities, as well as elevating the risk of involvement with the justice system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is therefore crucial that children's engagement with education is prioritised.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Coalition is urging Labor to adopt its \"sensible\" demands for environmental law reform, setting the stage for a showdown over the issue in the final week of parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is determined to deliver the largest reform to Australia's environmental laws in 26 years by Christmas, requiring either the support of the Coalition or the Greens in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ongoing Senate inquiry into the legislation, launched last week, has heard that the laws need more clarity for business and the environment, with stakeholders advising the government not to rush.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley is offering Environment Minister Murray Watt a lifeline, stating the reforms can still pass next week if the Coalition's demands are met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they are adopted, then we will be supportive of legislation next week,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor faces a Christmas crossroads over its environment laws reboot\n\n\"However, if the government rejects sensible suggestions and chooses to put jobs at risk, then we will vote against them, with an open mind to revisit negotiations next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe remain constructive and are seeking a path through ... But Labor shouldn\u2019t be rash \u2014 the Parliament cannot rush to failure here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition environment spokesperson Angie Bell has repeatedly insisted the Coalition has engaged in \"good faith negotiations\" but argues the laws are \"unworkable\", stifling productivity and investment.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Greens are critical that the laws don't end native forest logging, and they exclude a climate trigger that would require projects to consider the impact of climate change.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Coalition demanding?\n\nUnder the laws, Watt wants to establish the nation's first-ever National Environmental Protection Agency, tasked with ensuring compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Coalition argues that any powers related to the assessment or approval of projects must remain with the minister, not a regulator.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition is seeking a succinct and workable definition of the unacceptable impact test for high-polluting projects, with the current proposal convoluted and opening the prospect for too many rejections.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, it requests a clearer definition for the industry on what constitutes a net gain or parameters for demonstrating how the project minimises harm or improves the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amendments include a review of penalties under the new laws, which include fines of up to $825 million for environmental regulatory violations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe removal of existing streamlined pathways for project approvals and new emissions reporting requirements are also areas of concern.\n\n\n\n'Take the time': Groups echo warning\n\nMany of the demands are echoed by business groups, who are calling for consensus and bipartisan support for the laws to ensure lasting reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Senate inquiry on Thursday, Business Council of Australia CEO Bran Black said the government should \"take the time to get the right amendments\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're concerned about is that the existing definitions of unacceptable impact deliver everything but. What it does is enhance vagueness,\" he told the committee.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental groups have urged the government not to cower to industry, stating definitions need to be based on what the science says.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations group in the Northern Territory are calling for a greater consultation to be enshrined in the laws to prevent the destruction of sacred Indigenous sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Land Council general manager Josie Douglas is urging the government to wait until next March and not \"make the mistakes of the past\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s a truncated process and the bill is being rushed through without opportunity for the public or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups to provide input and feedback,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding that the \"changes need to ensure the bill is strengthened and not watered down and not weakened\".\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the storied halls of Victoria's State Library, there was nothing like a Teresa Teng classic to unite the room of business and community leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Asian-Australian trailblazers from around the country, gathered in Melbourne for a night to toast their shared success.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them was 18-year-old Annie Zhou.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe won this year's under-25 rising star award, for her financial literacy training aimed at disadvantaged students across Australia, Asia and Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd another project of mine is the Brighter Futures Youth podcast, and that's where I interview leaders from various industries across the world about their insights about their careers on leadership to help young people find a way to navigate life and succeed in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian-born Ferdy Bong was awarded for his contribution in the corporate sector - expanding a major Australian retail business into China.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here after high school, went to uni and then graduated. So yeah, I did not expect to get to this level. I hope what I did can inspire other people as well, it's definitely a lot of challenges, but then I have a lot of strong support beside me too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coming-together of the country's best and brightest Asian-Australian leaders is now in its seventh year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the gathering is a celebration of success, it's also a chance to highlight the persistent lack of diversity in leadership positions among our workplaces and institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartine Letts is Group CEO of AsiaLink, based at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly five people of Asian background are in the ASX 100 leadership positions. Asian-Australians make up around one fifth of our population. By any measure, they are under-represented. It is the most dynamic region economically. It will be for many years to come. It is almost negligent of Australian companies not to think about the advantage of having senior Asian-Australians with an understanding and perspective of Asia on their boards, for example. So it's a question of good sense, of commercial good sense, as well as equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year's winner in the arts and culture category, was South Australian author Lyn Dickens.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also told SBS about the importance of visibility for Asian-Australians in public life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equality or the sense of diversity we have is quite fragile, and we definitely need things like this event, and other events to remind people in the community that they are Australian as well and they're part of the society.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational cricketer Usman Khawaja was among the most high-profile of the award recipients.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his acceptance speech for the sports award, he shared his own story about belonging in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not ashamed to say I was a little bit embarrassed about being an Asian growing up in Australia. All I wanted to do was be an 'Australian'. I can proudly say now that I am Australian. I'm Australian with Asian heritage. I was born in Pakistan and to me, that means the world, to be able to say that with confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year's overall winner - Dr Sonu Bhaskar - was awarded for his contribution to stroke research and health equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not need to erase one part of our identity to celebrate another. That hyphen in Asian-Australian is not a barrier.. it is a bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Bhaskar reflected on what he described as increasing hostility in recent months, directed at Indian-Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discrimination, racism that we face, does not define us. We must get better, and the best way to be a better Indian-Australian is to serve our community.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this year's overall winner, it was a pledge to continue working to break that bamboo ceiling.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the rising star winner Annie Zhou believes there are many more Asian-Australian leaders to come.\n\n\n\n",

That would mean 12 months with a lack of leadership, no COP president in place, no plan, that would be irresponsible for multilateralism and this challenge will... And don't want that to happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Bowen says the in-principle compromise will see the summit held in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, and a role of presiding over negotiations handed to Australia, which he would hold.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Pacific will be kept front and centre through the negotiations for the event next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pre-COP will be held in the Pacific, in a pacific island, and it's a pledging event for the Pacific Resilience Fund, which is so important to us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has told ABC he has spoken to his counterparts in Papua New Guinea and Fiji and that everyone should be happy with the compromise - but P-N-G's foreign minister Justin Tkatchenko has told the A-F-P that he's disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe development has made previous reports moot about the cost of hosting COP31 in Adelaide being around the $2 billion mark, a figure Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that this government even considered spending $2 billion of taxpayers' money on this exercise just goes to show how their priorities are all wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Australia Premier Peter Malinauskus has also dismissed the figure, after expressing his disappointment that the event won't be held in Adelaide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of the $2 billion figure, we hadn't seen evidence of that, but we had seen evidence of some very big numbers indeed that would have been a substantial expense.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has also expressed her disappointment, accusing the federal government of being compromised because of its relationships with fossil fuel companies, and therefore failing to secure the bid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They didn't want to pressure to come on the exports of coal and gas out of Australia. So, rather than standing up for our region and the Pacific, we've had the Prime Minister and his government bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel industry. An absolute disgrace... lack of leadership... and a failure on all levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, for advocates who travelled to Brazil this year, they hope the federal government does take more action to support the Pacific countries on the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Simon Bradshaw is the COP31 Lead at Greenpeace Australia.\n\n\n\n",

So yeah, unfortunately, obviously, that those two are out. But, I think, an exciting opportunity fortunate for Scotty and for Brendan Doggett, who is going to make his debut. Brendan has been a on a few tours with Australia... he is very skilful; I think he has improved a hell of a lot the last few years.

The highlights of the match were a spectacular bicycle kick goal by star midfielder Scott McTominay and a strike from halfway by Kenny McLean to seal the win.\n\n\n\n\n\nStriker Lyndon Dykes, who grew up on Queensland's Gold Coast, was also playing for Scotland, and he is likely to be at the World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorway and Austria are the other teams we will see at the tournament for the first time in 28 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorway beat Italy 4-1, thanks to two goals from their renowned striker, Erling Haaland, who plays for Manchester City in the English Premier League.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria secured their place with a 1-1 draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n\nWhich teams can still qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup?\n\nThis is not the end of the World Cup qualifier thrillers, with the final six places at the tournament to be decided in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nSixteen teams from Europe will play off for four places and six teams from the rest of the world will play off for two places.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve of the European teams finished runner-up in their group and the remaining four teams finished third in their qualifying group but made the playoffs because they were among the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League group winners.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 16 teams in the European play-offs are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Kosovo, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine, Wales, Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland, and North Macedonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo other qualifiers come from the winners of an Interconfederation playoff, which will be played between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jamaica, Suriname, New Caledonia, Bolivia and Iraq \u2014 coached by Australian Graham Arnold.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO \"Australia have got this\": Socceroos remember World Cup qualifier against Uruguay, 20 years on SBS News 03:57 English\n\nWhich big names won't be at the World Cup?\n\nWhile teams such as Cura\u00e7ao, Uzbekistan, and Cape Verde are making their World Cup debuts, and others are reappearing after several years, some big football names are going to miss the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nSerbia, Greece, and Hungary are the best-known European teams that have not qualified for next year's World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour-time World Cup winners Italy will have to qualify through the play-offs and are in danger of missing the tournament for the third time in a row, after failing to make Qatar 2022 and Russia 2018.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Socceroos lose to Colombia in New York as World Cup preparations continue\n\nChile, a two-time Copa America winner, has also failed to qualify for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican giants Nigeria and Cameroon, who have qualified for the World Cup six and seven times, respectively, will also not feature in the tournament.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "But even Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King has said Woodside was partly to blame for the years-long process. We\u2019re also hearing constant talk about the need to fast-track development of critical minerals and rare earth resources to drive our renewables future. However, the critical minerals deal struck between Australia and the US last month highlights that government funding and trade agreements are increasingly focused on defence, not the energy transition that was pitched to Australians ahead of the election. In WA, we see a proposal to extract gallium from tailings at Alcoa\u2019s Wagerup refinery. We would expect that any such proposal would go through a rigorous environmental assessment process, but the current narrative around fast-tracking projects of \u201cnational significance\u201d could see a further dismantling of our national environment laws. Mining has costs for our environment and communities, and CCWA is well aware of the need to access minerals for renewables. But it\u2019s a different proposition altogether to further degrade our environment to fuel defence measures, without having an honest conversation with the community.\n\nOften, we see conversations framed around deregulation and the impossible challenges of \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d tape. What is missing from this conversation is a true account of the crisis nature is in, right across this state. Loading WA is home to eight of Australia\u2019s 15 biodiversity hotspots, and it contains between 600,000\u2013700,000 native species, many found nowhere else in the world. Across WA, 65 Threatened Ecological Communities are formally listed as such under the Biodiversity Conservation Act, with a further 390 identified as likely to be threatened and are a priority for listing. The toll is alarming. The Pilbara, one of the most prosperous regions in the country, has been developed at a significant cost.\n\nAlcoa\u2019s impact from strip-mining of our Northern Jarrah Forest has put precious flora and fauna on the brink of extinction, compounded due to climate change. As a movement, we have worked to elevate our concerns for nature, so they can be adequately accounted for in the planning of future projects in WA. Nature is well behind the eight-ball when it comes to industry, and industry-first rhetoric only reinforces that reality. While there is an argument for removing duplication in project approvals at a state and federal level, there is the dark art of using this as an excuse to compromise the entire process. Environment groups are not opposed to efficiency but what we want, and what the environment needs, is decision-making processes that ensure environmental protection.\n\nIn WA, we have a government hell-bent on passing a State Development Bill that, again, puts nature second to big business and industry. Loading It seeks to undermine the broad legislative outcomes we have agreed through parliament by creating a bill to rule over 40 pieces of existing legislation, including impacting the state Environmental Protection Act. Why would the federal government be handing over the assessment reigns to a state government that has shown scant regard for the protection of nature? In our political system, we have a dedicated resources minister. She does not consult heavily with environmental groups and makes no apologies in just backing the resources sector under her portfolio.",

        "text": "Their stories reveal both the extraordinary opportunity and the troubling brain drain facing Australia\u2019s tech sector. Andrew Tulloch: The billion-dollar brain Andrew Tulloch has left the AI start-up he co-founded to join Meta. If there is a face to the sheer financial madness of the 2025 AI talent wars, it is Andrew Tulloch. The man behind the $US1.5 billion headline is not a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d coder. Tulloch\u2019s background is one of pure, elite Australian academic achievement. Described by industry sources as shy and keen to retain a low profile, his resume speaks for itself. He graduated from one of Perth\u2019s most exclusive private schools, Christ Church Grammar, with the highest possible tertiary entrance rank (now ATAR) of 99.95 in 2007. He was school vice-captain, debating team captain, and a member of the first XI cricket and hockey teams. He studied at the University of Sydney, graduated in 2011 with first-class honours and a university medal in advanced mathematics. From there, he earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics and machine learning at Cambridge University.\n\nTulloch\u2019s staggering strategic value to Meta, however, comes from his first, 11-year stint at the company, which began after a brief period at Goldman Sachs in Sydney. At Meta (then Facebook), Tulloch was a pivotal engineer in the creation of PyTorch, the open-source AI framework Meta founded in 2016. PyTorch is not just a project at Meta, it underpins its entire AI strategy. It is the cornerstone upon which its research and production systems are built, and a key pillar of Zuckerberg\u2019s entire open-source AI philosophy. Loading In 2023, Tulloch left Meta. He did a stint at OpenAI before co-founding the start-up Thinking Machines Lab (TML) in February, alongside former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati. TML immediately became a formidable competitor, raising a staggering $US2 billion seed round at a $US12 billion valuation from investors including Andreessen Horowitz. Zuckerberg\u2019s pursuit of Tulloch was not merely an offensive move to gain a star researcher. It was a critical defensive manoeuvre to reclaim an irreplaceable asset and neutralise a profound competitive threat.\n\nMeta had reportedly tried to acquire TML outright to avoid losing ground in the AI race. When that failed, Zuckerberg personally targeted TML\u2019s key staff. Tulloch possessed deep, institutional knowledge of Meta\u2019s core AI engine and his role as co-founder of TML meant he was now using that expertise to build a next-generation competing system, backed by $US2 billion in investment. The $US1.5 billion offer (which, at the time, a Meta spokesperson said was \u201cinaccurate and ridiculous\u201d) was therefore not a \u201csalary\u201d in the traditional sense. It was a second attempt at an acquisition \u2013 this time, targeting the single human asset who built their engine, effectively neutralising the threat of him building a better one for a rival. While Tulloch initially declined the offer, the relentless campaign eventually succeeded. In late 2025, it was confirmed that Tulloch was leaving TML to rejoin Meta for an undisclosed, though undoubtedly massive, sum. Zuckerberg had, in effect, bought his engine-builder back. Sholto Douglas: The visionary at Anthropic Sholto Douglas never imagined working in AI when he was competing as one of the top 50 fencers in the world during his university years in Sydney.\n\nDespite applying to PhD programs in 2020 and being rejected, Douglas\u2019 independent research caught the attention of researchers at Google\u2019s AI research lab DeepMind, who recruited him on what he describes as \u201cthe most junior role that you could possibly be in\u201d \u2013 an L3 engineer with no track record. He arrived just a month before ChatGPT\u2019s release, when Google threw itself into panic mode.\u200b Anthropic researcher Sholto Douglas. \u201cThey took 1000 people and were like, \u2018Please figure out how to make a competitor to ChatGPT, your time starts now\u2019,\u201d Douglas says. \u201cThere was so much chaos and the field was so fresh that actually there was a lot of room for people to figure it out as you go along.\u201d \u200b Douglas is now a tech lead on Reinforcement Learning infrastructure at Anthropic, the AI lab founded by former OpenAI researchers that is now one of the primary contenders for the throne. He\u2019s working on \u201cscaling compute\u201d \u2013 effectively figuring out how to feed the AI more power and data to make it smarter. He describes the work as intense but deeply mission-driven. \u201cEveryone here is trying to bend the arc of history,\u201d he says. Douglas is coy about his own salary but is adamant that the reported numbers in the industry are real, as is the value that these researchers and engineers are delivering to their companies.\n\n\u201cCompanies are spending tens of billions of dollars on compute,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you figure out a way to make the model run 10 per cent more efficiently, you\u2019ve actually just saved billions of dollars ... The right people can make huge improvements.\u201d Douglas admits the poaching is relentless. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty CEO-driven,\u201d he says. Tech titans like Altman, Sergey Brin and Zuckerberg personally text and call researchers to recruit them. \u201cYou get a text from Sam [Altman] saying, \u2018Hey, would you like to chat?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re super nervous.\u201d Tristan Heywood: Making ChatGPT faster Douglas helped pull friend Tristan Heywood into the vortex. Heywood, an engineer who grew up in Sydney and was awarded the University Medal at the University of Sydney, watched from afar as Douglas landed a job at DeepMind.\n\nOpenAI researcher Tristan Heywood. \u201cIt really proved it was possible,\u201d Heywood says. He quit his job, spent three months intensely studying transformers and chatbots, and landed a role at OpenAI in January 2023, just as the ChatGPT craze was igniting. Heywood\u2019s job is tangible: he makes ChatGPT faster. As part of the inference team, he optimises the massive mathematical calculations required to generate text, ensuring the model can serve millions of users without melting down the GPU clusters. When asked about his salary, Heywood is straightforward: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, it is seven figures.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a wild stat,\u201d Douglas says of his friend\u2019s ascent. \u201cHe 10 times-ed his salary in a month.\u201d\n\nBut the money comes with a heavy psychological load. Heywood acknowledges the weight of working on technology that could reshape \u2013 or end \u2013 civilisation. \u201cIt is possible that, like, a real AGI [artificial general intelligence] could cause extinction of humanity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is kind of daunting that we have that responsibility.\u201d He worries about bad actors using the tech to develop bioweapons, a fear echoed by many in the safety-conscious corridors of OpenAI and Anthropic. Despite the existential dread, the thrill of the race is undeniable. Heywood\u2019s is a role that sits at the bleeding edge of human engineering. Ben Goodger: The architect of the internet If there is a singular architect of how humans experience the modern web, it is Ben Goodger. A New Zealander raised in Auckland, Goodger didn\u2019t just watch the browser wars of the past two decades; he won them.\n\nIn the late 1990s, while studying computer engineering at the University of Auckland, Goodger began sending code patches to Netscape, the dominant browser of the era. \u201cI got this ping on chat from one of the top engineers at Netscape saying, \u2018Do you want a job?\u2019\u201d he recalls. He accepted and moved to Mountain View for what was supposed to be a one-year internship. OpenAI executive Ben Goodger. He never really left the frontline. Goodger went on to ship the first version of Firefox in 2004, breaking Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the web. He moved to Google, where he was instrumental in creating Chrome, the browser that now runs the world. Eighteen months ago, he joined OpenAI to lead engineering on Atlas, a project that aims to do to the browser what ChatGPT did to search. \u201cIt puts ChatGPT at the heart of the browser,\u201d Goodger says of the new tool, which allows users to let the AI \u201cdrive\u201d their web experience rather than just retrieving information. He describes the shift as moving from a world of search queries to one where \u201chabits take over\u201d, allowing the AI to click around, fill out forms, and execute tasks on the user\u2019s behalf. Goodger compares the atmosphere at OpenAI to his early days at Google \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not the same, but it rhymes\u201d \u2013 describing a culture of enthusiasm to build and release products tempered by the heavy responsibility of serving 800 million weekly users.\n\nDespite his legendary status in Silicon Valley, Goodger says he retains the thick skin of an Antipodean expat. He dismisses the fervour around 10-figure compensation packages. \u201cI don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about crazy compensation packages,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m spending time with my team.\u201d He views the exodus of talent from Australia and New Zealand not as a crisis, but as a cultural trait. OpenAI\u2019s new AI browser Atlas. \u201cWe\u2019re explorers,\u201d he says of the Kiwi and Aussie diaspora. \u201cWe want to go out and see what the world\u2019s like ... it\u2019s just kind of a fact of life.\u201d While he notes the billboards in San Francisco are now exclusively advertising AI products, Goodger believes the tech scenes in Australia and New Zealand are richer than when he left 22 years ago. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t really care where you come from,\u201d he says. \u201cThe world wants to see what your idea is.\u201d Casey Flint: The AI strategist If Tulloch, Douglas, Goodger and Heywood are building the brains, Casey Flint is helping build the body. Raised in Winton, a rural Queensland town with a population of 800, Flint\u2019s journey to the C-suite of a frontier AI lab is perhaps the most unlikely of all.\n\n\u201cWe had a fly-in, fly-out doctor,\u201d she says of her childhood. \u201cWe were two hours away from the nearest IGA.\u201d Her story illustrates both the pull of Silicon Valley and what Australia risks losing.\u200b Growing up without permanent doctors, dentists or psychologists, Flint became fascinated with how technology could transform healthcare. That interest led to a biochemistry degree at the University of Queensland and eventually a six-year career at Uber, where she worked her way from intern to strategy roles spanning Brisbane, Sydney, Amsterdam, Japan and South Korea.\u200b Casey Flint was at Uber before joining Square Peg as an investment associate. Credit: AFR A pivot to venture capital at Square Peg gave Flint a front-row seat to Australia\u2019s AI ecosystem, and its limitations. She realised she wanted to be \u201cin the room when it happens\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d go to SF [San Francisco], I\u2019d have these conversations with researchers and founders here, and then I\u2019d come back and I\u2019d get pitched a concept that was like six to 12 months old by SF standards,\u201d she says. \u201cI found that a bit fatiguing, and really wanted to be at the very frontier.\u201d \u200b\n\nAfter a stint at Amazon Web Services focusing on AI investments, Flint joined ReflectionAI as chief of staff, working with former DeepMind and OpenAI researchers building what they describe as \u201csuperintelligence\u201d. The team recently launched Asimov, a code research agent for engineering teams.\u200b Flint worries about AI\u2019s economic implications for Australians like her family back in Winton. \u2018I come from a rural part of Australia \u2026 If you have all of this economic value and knowledge work basically being done overseas ... how are Australian businesses capturing value from that?\u2019 Casey Flint \u201cI come from a rural part of Australia,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are nearly enough people thinking about the economic implications. If you have all of this economic value and knowledge work basically being done overseas ... how are Australian businesses capturing value from that?\u201d She believes a new \u201cFAANG\u201d \u2013 comprising tech giants Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) \u2013 is emerging and is determined that \u201cReflection\u201d will one day form part of the acronym.\n\nJames Groeneveld: The rower who rebuilt the engine James Groeneveld was never meant to be fixing billion-dollar server stacks in Silicon Valley; he was supposed to be in a hospital ward back home. The Brisbane native headed to Harvard on a rowing scholarship with a clear, parental-approved plan: \u201cI\u2019d come back one day [as a] doctor, my mum would be happy, and everything would work out.\u201d That plan evaporated in his freshman year, derailed by a computer science course that left him enamoured with the power of code. Today, instead of hospital rounds, Groeneveld is dissecting the digital brains of Character.AI, one of the world\u2019s most heavily used consumer AI platforms. Character.AI chief intelligence officer James Groeneveld. Having cut his teeth at Google Brain managing the massive fleets of chips used to train early AI models, Groeneveld joined Character during a period of chaotic hyper-growth. His mandate sounds terrifying: rebuild the entire technological foundation of the company while millions of users were actively using it.\n\n\u201cWe were building the planes while flying,\u201d Groeneveld says of the six-month sprint to replace the prototype code written by brilliant \u2013 but commercially inexperienced \u2013 researchers. \u201cThey\u2019re brilliant mathematician types ... But not the best systems programmers building for scale.\u201d Groeneveld argues that the astronomical salaries defining his industry aren\u2019t just hype; they are a reflection of a sector where the rule book hasn\u2019t been written yet. He describes the industry as being at the \u201cvery beginning of the onion\u201d, lacking the established frameworks that exist in traditional web development. \u201cThere are no best practices, really,\u201d he says. Consequently, companies are forced to pay for the few engineers who understand the raw fundamentals of how these models interact with hardware. When a single training run costs $1 billion, the engineer who ensures it works is worth their weight in gold. \u201cTying the compensation to the outcome makes sense,\u201d Groeneveld says. \u201cIf one person can have that large of an economic outcome ... 2 per cent of that is nothing in the grand scheme of things.\u201d Despite his success in the US, Groeneveld remains a believer in the grit and determination of Australian talent. He points to rising stars such as the \u201cUnsloth\u201d brothers (Daniel and Michael Han), who began optimising AI models from a Sydney bedroom, as proof that Aussies are punching above their weight. For now, however, the centre of gravity remains in San Francisco, which is a long way from the rowing sheds of Brisbane.\n\nCan Australia and New Zealand compete? Should they try? The list of Australian AI leaders continues to grow. There is Joel Pobar, a veteran engineering leader who recently returned to Meta\u2019s superintelligence division after a stint at Anthropic. Clare Birch, a former quantum chemist and Blackbird investor, is now helping build the ecosystem at Mira Murati\u2019s Thinking Machines as chief of staff. And Ben Brooks, a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Centre, is shaping the global regulations that will govern these technologies. Joel Pobar is an Australian engineering leader who recently returned to Meta\u2019s superintelligence division after a stint at Anthropic. The consensus among the expatriates is clear: for now, the cutting edge is in San Francisco. You just have to be there. \u201cIt would be hard in Australia,\u201d Heywood says. \u201cOpenAI is ... very consequential. Everything they do is a lot more impactful.\u201d However, they believe Australia is not out of the game, provided it stops trying to build its own ChatGPT and starts playing to its strengths. \u201cAustralia is one of the best places in the world to build compute,\u201d Douglas says, citing the nation\u2019s solar capacity, stable rule of law and massive superannuation capital. \u201cThe world is going to be accelerator constrained for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nFlint echoes this \u201clower stack\u201d strategy. She believes Australia should become an energy and mineral superpower for the AI age, supplying the copper for the chips and the green energy for the data centres. \u201cWe need a lot of energy to power data centres ... Australia could become an energy superpower.\u201d Loading Heywood also has an idea for Australia, one that wouldn\u2019t necessarily stem the brain drain but might help maximise the benefits from AI. \u201cAustralia should ask American tech companies to release open-source models,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the [Australian] government is negotiating a big contract, they can push for that as part of negotiations. This would let Australian companies build on top of strong AI models, and also reduces the centralisation of the technology in the US.\u201d For now, though, the brain drain continues. San Francisco\u2019s pull \u2013 with its \u201cRenaissance\u201d vibe and its eye-watering compensation packages \u2013 is simply too strong.",

        "text": "What is Eminem\u2019s argument? Eminem objected to the trademark on several grounds. One argument is grounded in consumer law \u2013 that trading on the name Swim Shady could mislead or deceive customers into thinking they\u2019re buying a product associated with the rapper. In response, Swim Shady contends the two parties are in significantly different industries, and that a beach and lifestyle wear company in Australia is unlikely to be confused with the alter ego of a US rapper which was introduced in an EP in 1997. Eminem continues to sell official Slim Shady merchandise \u2013 one of several income streams that has built his net worth to a reported $US250 million. A Swim Shady beach umbrella Credit: Swim Shady\n\nEminem is also claiming the trademark should be refused because it was applied for in \u201cbad faith\u201d, pointing to the fact the business initially chose the name \u201cSlim Shade\u201d before \u201cSwim Shady\u201d. Jane Rawlings, barrister and acting director of Intellectual Property Program at the University of Technology Sydney\u2019s law faculty, said Eminem intervened promptly to protect his ability to use the trademark in the future. \u201cHe is saying, \u2018I\u2019m the real slim shady\u2019 and that the people behind Swim Shady are just imitating and could mislead the general public,\u201d Rawlings said. Crucially, Eminem did not have a trademark on the name \u201cSlim Shady\u201d in Australia at the time the Sydney business lodged its application for \u201cSwim Shady\u201d. This works against Eminem, said Olugbenga Olatunji, intellectual property and trademarks lecturer at the University of Sydney.\n\nJeremy Scott and Elizabeth Afrakoff are the husband and wife behind Swim Shady. Credit: Swim Shady \u201cThe way intellectual property works is it\u2019s the first in line that has the right, so Swim Shady would seem to have the stronger case on that point, because they filed their application first,\u201d Olatunji said. Instead, Eminem held trademarks for \u201cShady\u201d and \u201cShady Limited\u201d, but they have been the subject of non-use applications. In Australia, if there hasn\u2019t been genuine use of a trademark for three years and one month, there are grounds for removal. Eminem subsequently applied to trademark \u201cSlim Shady\u201d in Australia in January 2025. He also launched objections to Swim Shady\u2019s US and UK trademarks. Despite the dispute, the company was launched publicly and began selling products in December 2024.\n\nUltimately, because of the Madrid System for coordinating trademarks internationally, the Australian case could dictate the matter globally. Eminem performing at the Oscars in 2020. Credit: AP \u201cThe reason why Eminem is concentrating in Australia is because it\u2019s the root in which all other applications are made,\u201d Rawlings said. \u201cIf he can knock over Swim Shady\u2019s trademark here, all other applications overseas lose their priority.\u201d What\u2019s Katy Perry got to do with it? A key part of Eminem\u2019s argument is that while he may not hold a local trademark to \u201cSlim Shady\u201d, he does in the US, and that the US trademark has led to him acquiring a reputation in Australia. This is ground for opposing a trademark in Australia.\n\nLoading It is also the argument at the centre of another high-profile case. Since 2009, US singer Katy Perry has been fighting Australian clothing designer Katie Perry. The latter registered a trademark to sell clothing under the name Katie Perry in 2008, something which did not prevent the US artist from selling branded clothing when she toured Australia the next year. However, in 2019, Katie Perry launched legal action against the singer Katy Perry, whose birth name was Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, in Australia\u2019s Federal Court. The fashion designer alleged her trademark had been infringed when the singer had sold branded merchandise in Australia. The designer won the case but lost a subsequent appeal. The High Court will consider the reputation argument in what could force closure of the Australian Perry\u2019s clothing label. The verdict is also likely to set a precedent that will influence Eminem\u2019s case against Swim Shady, said Olatunji.\n\nKaty Perry in Australia in 2024. Credit: Eddie Jim \u201cAll of us are waiting on the High Court with bated breath as to whether general reputation is enough for famous artists,\u201d Olatunji said. \u201cIf it upholds [in favour of Katy Perry] then it\u2019s likely Eminem will prevail here too.\u201d Where to from here? Hearings are yet to be scheduled in either Australia or the US, but both sides are refusing to budge. \u201cIt\u2019s very much \u2018game on\u2019 on both sides of this,\u201d Rawlings said.",

        "text": "And often forgotten with surfers - again particularly with the perpetually sunny, \u2018Happy\u2019 Gilmore - is just how competitive some of them can be. As Gilmore and Moore return from two-year breaks, they are joined on the men\u2019s side by comebacks from Hawaiian three-time world champion John John Florence, and Brazil\u2019s Gabriel Medina (two titles), who has recovered from a torn pectoral. Generations collide: Molly Picklum, Carissa Moore and Stephanie Gilmore. Credit: Matt Willis It all makes for a perfect storm of 19 world titles returning to a WSL tour more aligned with surfing\u2019s traditional season structure. Gone is the controversial mid-season cut that Gilmore almost fell foul of in May 2022, a campaign which ended with the most remarkable of her eight world titles.\n\nThe one-day, winner-takes-all final five format also hits the bricks, with the 2026 world champion to be crowned once more based on cumulative points accrued across the entire season. Despite her stunning 2022 triumph running the field from fifth place, and knocking off that year\u2019s first-place finisher Moore, Gilmore summed up the thoughts of most surfers on the finals format in the hours after lifting her trophy. Stephanie Gilmore celebrates her record eighth world title in 2022. Credit: Beatriz Ryder/World Surf League \u201cCarissa in my mind is the real world champ this year,\u201d Gilmore said at the time. \u201cShe had such a stellar year. She had so many wonderful performances. I disliked this format, to be honest.\n\n\u201cI was like, the world champion should be crowned in all the different waves over the entire \u00adperiod of the year. Now [after winning the final from fifth-place] I love it.\u201d Moore\u2019s two runner-up finishes to Gilmore (2022) and Marks in 2023 despite dominating all season were held up by many as cause enough to ditch the finals format, though the Hawaiian has always been typically gracious about being beaten on the day. The 2026 format sets up an especially enticing season, with a historic world title crowning regardless of who wins it. For the first time, the world title will be crowned in the final event at Hawaii\u2019s Pipeline - as it was in the men\u2019s competition for years, but never the women\u2019s. The wave was long deemed too dangerous for the girls.\n\nPicklum, Simmers and a slew of the world\u2019s best women have smashed that perception, and now the iconic break shapes as pivotal to the 2026 championship, given a win there is worth 1.5 times a victory anywhere else. For Gilmore and Moore, the 2026 circuit could be tailor-made with an April kick-off at Bells Beach, followed by Margaret River and the Gold Coast. Stephanie Gilmore: one of the smoothest surfers in history. Credit: Pat Nolan/World Surf League Picklum, Simmers and Tyler Wright are all strong at Bells, but Gilmore is on another level - her four Bells triumphs sit behind only local icon Gail Couper\u2019s record 10 wins in the 60s and 70s. Gilmore is even better in her own backyard at Snapper Rocks. Again, no-one comes close to her six event wins from 18 appearances.\n\nHow the veterans return is the unknown, but history says Gilmore and Moore (eight wins herself across the three Australian events) could leave these shores well in the title race. Both have had previous wins at 2026 tour stops in Brazil, South Africa and California, with Gilmore also prevailing in El Salvador and Moore winning two competitions of the four contests held in wave pools. Locations in surfing are a bit like tennis grand slam surfaces and foreign pitches in cricket - a variety of waves play to certain surfing strengths and weaknesses. In announcing her comeback, Gilmore noted the tour\u2019s heaviest waves - Teahupo\u2019o (Tahiti), Cloudbreak (Fiji) and Pipeline - are \u201clocations where I don\u2019t have great results\u201d. To be fair, she\u2019s rarely competed at them because the tour just didn\u2019t stop there for women for so long.",
