        "text": "Wall Street weakened overnight as investors worldwide get more skeptical about US investments because of President Donald Trump 's trade war and his criticism of the US Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order.\n\nThe S&P 500 sank 2.4 per cent in another wipeout on Monday. That yanked the index that's at the centre of many accounts 16 per cent below its record set two months ago.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5 per cent, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6 per cent.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis dies aged 88\n\nCharts on the screen of a Wall Street trader are seen through his glasses as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, on Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)\n\nPerhaps more worryingly, US government bonds and the value of the American dollar also sank as prices retreated across US markets.\n\nIt's an unusual move because Treasury bonds and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness.\n\nThis time around, though, it's policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world's safest investments.\n\nTrump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they're not rolled back.\n\nUS talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they're seen as a \"test case,\" according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.\n\n\"The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,\" Trump said in all capitalised letters on his Truth Social Network.\n\nHe also said that \"the businessmen who criticise tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,\" likewise in all caps.\n\nUS Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is being pushed by US President Donald Trump to slash interest rates. (AP)\n\nAlso hanging over the market are worries about Trump's anger at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.\n\nTrump last week criticised Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice.\n\nThe central bank has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its two per cent goal from more than nine per cent three years ago.\n\nTrump talked on Monday about a slowdown for the US economy that could be coming unless \"Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nA move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control.\n\nSuch a move could further weaken, if not kill, the US' reputation as the world's safest place to keep cash.\n\nAll the uncertainty striking pillars at the centre of financial markets means some investors say they're having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest.\n\nGold is now the premier safe-haven refuge for nervous investors. (Getty)\n\n\"We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,\" strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report.\n\n\"The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, technology stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week.\n\nThe full list of Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs View Gallery\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90.\n\nGold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others.\n\nIn the bond market, shorter-term US Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy.",

        "text": "The death of a pope starts a centuries-old ritual involving sacred oaths by the cardinals electing a successor, the piercing of ballots with a needle and thread after they're counted, and then burning them to produce either the white or black smoke to signal if there's a new leader for the world's 1.3 billion Catholics.\n\nThe election itself is shrouded in secrecy, with cardinals forbidden from communicating with the outside world what happened during the voting in the conclave behind the frescoed walls of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nSt. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned. Here is what happens when a pope dies, a period known as the \"sede vacante,\" or the \"vacant See.\"\n\nA file image of a giant monitor in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, from 2013 that shows the heavy wooden door to the Sistine Chapel being closed and locked, signalling the start of the conclave to elect a new pope. (AP)\n\nWho's in charge?\n\nIf the pope has died, the camerlengo, or chamberlain, must certify the death and seal the papal apartment. He runs administrative and financial duties of the Holy See until a new pope takes over.\n\nThe largely ceremonial job of camerlengo is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Irish-born American head of the Vatican's laity office.\n\nNearly all prefects of Vatican offices lose their jobs when a pope dies, but a few stay on, including the foreign minister and the master of liturgical ceremonies, who plays a key role in assembling the conclave.\n\nThe dean of the College of Cardinals summons the cardinals for the funeral, presiding at the Mass before the conclave begins. That position is currently held by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the retired head of the Vatican's office for bishops.\n\nIn November 2024, Francis reformed the rites to be used for his funeral, simplifying them to emphasise his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican. Francis has chosen to be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica, where his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani, is located.\n\nWorldwide mourning, rites and rituals following death of Pope Francis View Gallery\n\nWhat's the timing?\n\nThe death of a pope begins a precise sequence of events that include the confirmation of death in the pontiff's home, the transfer of the coffin to St. Peter's Basilica for public viewing, a funeral Mass and burial. Interment must take place between the fourth and sixth day after his death.\n\nAfter the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the \"novendiali\".\n\nDuring this period, the cardinals arrive in Rome. To give everyone time to assemble, the conclave must begin 15-20 days after the \"sede vacante\" is declared, although it can start sooner if the cardinals agree.\n\nWho can elect a pope?\n\nOnly cardinals under age 80 are eligible, and current regulations limit the number of electors to 120. According to the most recently updated Vatican statistics, there were 136 cardinals under age 80 and eligible to vote, though that number may change before the conclave begins.\n\nThose over 80 can't vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the \"existential peripheries\" to find those who suffer \u2014 an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election.\n\nA view of the Cardinals' tables in the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. The conclave will celebrate Mass here for prayers for inspiration to elect the successor. (AP)\n\nWho are possible candidates?\n\nAny baptised Roman Catholic male is eligible to be pope, but since 1378, only cardinals have been selected. Some current leading candidates:\n\nCardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, 70, Francis' secretary of state and a veteran Vatican diplomat.\n\nCardinal Marc Ouellet of Canada, 80, head of the Vatican's bishops office from 2010 to 2023.\n\nCardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria, 80, a student of Pope Benedict XVI, and thus ostensibly having appeal for conservatives.\n\nCardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines, 67, brought by Francis to head the Vatican's massive missionary office.\n\nCardinal Matteo Zuppi of Italy, 69, a Francis prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who headed the Italian bishops conference.\n\nWhite smoke is seen billowing out from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel and announcing that a new pope has been elected on March 13, 2013. (AP)\n\nHow are the votes taken?\n\nA first ballot is held in the Sistine Chapel on the afternoon after the initial Mass. If no pope is elected, over the ensuing days two ballots are held each morning and two each afternoon.\n\nThe ballots are rectangular pieces of paper with the words: \"Eligo in Summum Pontificem\" (\"I elect as supreme pontiff\") written on top, with a space for a name. Each cardinal makes his choice, folds the paper in half, walks to the front of the chapel and declares: \"I call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.\"\n\nHe then puts the ballot on a tray and tips it into a receptacle.\n\nThree designated cardinals, known as scrutineers, check each ballot to see if it is filled out correctly. Each name is read aloud and counted, with the results announced to the conclave after each round.\n\nIf no one gets the needed two-thirds of votes, the ballots are pierced with a needle and thread, which is then knotted and placed on a tray, and another round of voting is prepared.\n\nBenedict modified some of John Paul's 1996 conclave rules, most notably excluding his vision that a pope could be elected by a simple majority if voting was stalemated. Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority.\n\nThe life of Pope Francis View Gallery\n\nWhat about secrecy?\n\nBenedict also tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication.\n\nIn John Paul's rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe \"absolute and perpetual secrecy\" and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices.\n\nThey now declare: \"I take this oath fully aware that an infraction thereof will incur the penalty of automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See. So help me God and these Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hand.\"\n\nCardinals also are bound by secrecy, although the threat of excommunication only hangs over them explicitly if they are found to have accepted payment for their vote, allowed secular powers to influence it, or entered into pacts with other cardinals to back a candidate.\n\nBlack smoke emerges from the chimney on the Sistine Chapel as cardinals voted on the second day of the conclave to elect a pope in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, back in 2013. (AP)\n\nDo we have a pope?\n\nAfter the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.\n\nChemical cartridges are added to ensure there is no confusion over the color. To produce black smoke, a cartridge containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 the component of coal tar \u2014 and sulphur is burned with the ballots. For white smoke, a cartridge of potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin is burned with the ballots.\n\nBells also are rung to signal the election of a pope for further clarity.\n\nThe new pope is introduced from the loggia overlooking St. Peter's Square with the words, \"Habemus Papam!\" (\"We have a pope!\") and his chosen papal name. The new pope then emerges and gives his first blessing.",

        "text": "The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins.\n\nThey involve the certification of death and public display of his body for the faithful to pay their respects, followed by the funeral and burial.\n\nPope Francis revised various rites last year, simplifying the funeral rituals to emphasise his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes.\n\nBut the core elements remain, including the three key moments that must be observed between the death of a pope and his burial.\n\nThe reforms are incorporated into the slim red volume Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis, Latin for Rite of Burial for Roman Pontiffs .\n\nROLLING COVERAGE: \ufeff Pope Francis dies aged 88\n\nWhy were changes to the funeral rites necessary?\n\nWhile popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that elects their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites hadn\u2019t been undertaken since 2000.\n\nThe changes became necessary after Francis expressed his own wishes, and after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on December 31, 2022.\n\nFor Benedict, the Vatican had to work out the novelty of a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years.\n\nA few months later, Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the entire book of rites to simplify them.\n\nIn explaining the reforms, Ravelli said the changes aimed \u201cto emphasise even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world\".\n\nThe life of Pope Francis View Gallery\n\nThe declaration of death\n\nThe three main stations, or moments, occur first in his home, then in St Peter\u2019s Basilica, and then in the place of burial.\n\nThe reform allows for the formal confirmation of death to occur in Francis\u2019 personal chapel rather than his bedroom.\n\nIt is unclear why, the change may be more practical than anything since Francis chose to live in a small suite in the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta hotel rather than the Apostolic Palace. He has a personal chapel at Santa Marta.\n\nUpon the pope\u2019s death, the head of the Vatican health service examines the body, ascertains the cause of death and writes a report.\n\nThe body is dressed in white.\n\nThe body rests in the pope\u2019s personal chapel for the ritual pronouncement of death, presided over by the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See administration between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of another.\n\nThe camerlengo is American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, one of Francis\u2019 most trusted aides.\n\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber. (Getty)\n\nIn a change from the past, the rite no longer requires the body to be placed in the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.\n\nNow, the pope\u2019s body is placed in a wooden coffin, with a zinc coffin inside.\n\nThe pope is dressed in red liturgical vestments, his mitre \u2014 the traditional headdress of bishops \u2014 and the pallium woollen stole, a kind of scarf.\n\nThe Pasqual candle, a large, decorated candle used at Easter, is placed nearby.\n\nThe camerlengo drafts the formal declaration of death, attaching the certificate that had been prepared by the health service chief.\n\nThe master of liturgical celebrations, Ravelli, then decides when other faithful can pay their respects before the coffin is moved to St Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing.\n\nOnce in the basilica\n\nWhen the body is brought into the basilica, the Litany of Saints chant is sung.\n\nThe camerlengo leads the procession.\n\nIn another change, the pope\u2019s body is no longer placed on an elevated bier.\n\nRather, the simplified wooden coffin is placed facing the pews, with the Pasqual candle nearby.\n\nA general view of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. (Getty)\n\nThe sealing of the coffin\n\nThe night before the funeral, the camerlengo presides over the closing and sealing of the coffin, in the presence of other senior cardinals.\n\nA white cloth is placed over the pope\u2019s face.\n\nA bag containing coins minted during his papacy is placed in the coffin along with a one-page written account of his papacy \u2014 known in Italian as a \"rogito,\" a word indicating an official deed.\n\nIt is read aloud by the master of liturgical ceremonies and then rolled up and slipped inside a cylindrical tube that is placed inside the coffin.\n\nAnother copy is kept in the Vatican archives.\n\nThe covers of both the zinc coffin and the wooden one bear a cross and the papal coat of arms.\n\nFrancis\u2019 coat of arms, which he kept from when he was bishop, features a shield and the monogram of his Jesuit order, with the words \u201cMiserando atque eligendo,\u201d Latin for \u201cHaving had mercy, he called him\u201d.\n\nIt comes from an episode in the Gospel where Christ picks a seemingly unworthy person to follow him.\n\nThe funeral and burial\n\nThe funeral is presided over by the dean of the College of Cardinals or, if that is not possible, by the vice dean or another senior cardinal.\n\nThe current dean is Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91.\n\nThe vice dean is Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81.\n\nFrancis earlier this year extended both of their five-year terms rather than appoint new ones.\n\nFrancis\u2019 reform allows for burial outside the Vatican, with the camerlengo presiding. Various seals are impressed on the coffin, and it is placed inside the tomb.\n\nFrancis has said he wants to be buried not in St Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St Mary Major Basilica across town.\n\nHis choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).\n\nAfter every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jewelled golden book.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told Mexico\u2019s N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",

God's mercy dispels hatred and the spirit of revenge'.\n\n\" With God, may Pope Francis rest in peace. \"\n\nState premiers have also shared their condolences and praised the work of Pope Francis.\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan described him as a tireless advocate for the poor and a relentless voice for the marginalised.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns said Francis was a \"pope of the people\" and showed the power of the great Catholic teachings.\n\nSouth Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas extended his government's deepest condolences to the Catholic community and said his thoughts were with \"all those who found hope\" in Francis's teachings.\n\nAnd Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the pope had impacted the lives of millions through the values of faith, kindness and equality.\n\nPraise for Francis\n\nThe Archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, said his congregation stood united with the greater Catholic community in its grief.\n\n\"As the church enters this time of Easter filled with the light and hope of the world, it is with deep sadness that we have received the news of the death of His Holiness, Pope Francis,\" Archbishop Comensoli said.\n\n\"Pope Francis, who came from the peripheries of the world, has been a father of the poor, and a witness of joy and hope. May the Lord, he so faithfully trusted in, now welcome him into eternal life.\"\n\nPeter Comensoli was among those to pay tribute to Pope Francis.

He would have been meeting a thousand people a day and it was very moving for me. \"\n\nThe Imam of Australia's largest mosque has sent his condolences to the Catholic community on behalf of Australian Muslims.\n\nImam Kauser, National President and Missionary-in-Charge of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Australia, said Pope Francis had \"dedicated his life to helping the poor and those who were suffering from war, injustice, and persecution\".\n\n\"He was a kind and humble man who worked to bring people of different faiths together.\"\n\nPope 'could have done more' for abuse victims\n\nRichard Jabara urged the Conclave to elect a pope who would address abuse by clergy. (ABC News)\n\nDespite his record of meeting abuse survivors and offering apologies to victims, some advocates said Pope Francis could have done more to address the issue.\n\nAbuse survivor and head of the In Good Faith Foundation, Richard Jabara, said he felt Pope Francis missed an opportunity to address historic abuse by members of the clergy in Australia.\n\n\"My message obviously to the Conclave is hopefully that they pick a pope who will not forget us and probably do more,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there's always more that can be done.\n\n\"The Catholic Church did, in the end, come forward to help victims but they did it reluctantly and it took a royal commission to expose what they did.\"\n\nAnother advocacy group, Loud Fence, offered sympathy to those who were grieving, acknowledging that \"many face a painful tension between their spiritual beliefs and the Church's failures.\"\n\n\"During his papacy, Pope Francis spoke publicly about the devastating reality of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. He condemned abuse as a \"scourge\" that must be addressed by society as a whole, and he acknowledged the deep suffering of victim-survivors,\" Loud Fence said in a statement.\n\n\"While he took some steps toward confronting these injustices, much more is still needed.\"",

        "text": "If your child has recently started learning a musical instrument, you might be familiar with the struggle to get them to practise.\n\nFor many kids, spending time with their chosen musical instrument can be frustrating.\n\nPractising often involves learning unfamiliar music, working on techniques as well as correcting mistakes. Some kids can find the process repetitive and boring.\n\nAll your music questions answered Photo shows A red apple is carved with music symbols. A rubab sits on one side of the apple and a hard on the other. Text reads Music Class Music Class is a weekly deep dive into all things music, including musical terms, notation, theory and much more.\n\nForming the habit to practise is an important life lesson children need to learn, according to longtime music educator and researcher Anita Collins.\n\n\"The understanding that when we work at something, we will get better at it is a transferable skill,\" Dr Collins says.\n\nBut this is easier said than done.\n\nDr Collins and ABC Classic's Music Class co-host Genevieve Lang, who is also a professional harpist, share tips to make practising more manageable.\n\nWhy do you need to practise music?\n\nPractising is about developing skills, familiarity and confidence, Dr Collins says.\n\nEven people who are musically talented still need to practise, including the things they find repetitive and boring.\n\n\"What the brain does [while learning through repetition] is problem solving,\" Dr Collins says.\n\nPractising allows the brain to process the huge amount of musical information needed to develop the skill required to play the instrument or sing. It also allows the player to build the muscle coordination to perform more virtuosic or technical pieces of music.\n\nThat's really important for an instrumentalist like Lang.\n\nHow to set children up for success when they start learning music Photo shows A young girl in pigtails and denim overalls sits at a piano with sheet music. Her hands are on the keys as she reads the music. Learning music has many benefits including persistance and resilience.\n\n\"We have a phrase in Music Class: musicians are tiny muscle athletes,\" Lang says.\n\nLang says practising the music slowly at first can help with the learning process.\n\nShe uses \"slow practise\" to map out the movement of her hand on her harp, allowing her to concentrate on tempo and volume when she increases the speed.\n\n\"The other thing that slow practise allows you to do is relax in between every note,\" she says.\n\nRelaxing is important to keep musicians safe from injury through repetitive strain, especially for instruments like the harp which require players to hold a certain posture for a long period of time.\n\nBut if kids make mistakes while learning notes, it's important to pause and correct it before doing too many repetitions.\n\nOtherwise, \"they're just practising their mistake,\" Lang says.\n\nHow do you get kids motivated to practise?\n\nDr Collins compares practising music to building an exercise habit.\n\nKids need a goal or a reason to work towards, such as a performance or an exam.\n\nParents could start with having a designated space that's set up with a music stand, such as a corner of the room, and a nominated time to practise.\n\n\"The most important part is actually developing the habit,\" Dr Collins says.\n\nFor the first two to four weeks, \"what we're actually doing is not developing them musically,\" Dr Collins says.\n\n\" We're developing the habit that at a given time, I go to my space and I pick my instrument up and I do my practise. \"\n\nDr Collins and Lang have also role modelled practising music themselves.\n\nBoth incorporate music practise as part of their day, especially showing their kids how to be accountable to get better.\n\n\"I'm very honest with my kids when I need to practise,\" Lang says.\n\nLang's kids know when she needs to do more practise for upcoming performances.\n\n\"They will tell me 'mum, that doesn't sound too good yet'.\"\n\nBut conversely, Lang isn't averse to \"a good old bribe\" when it comes to motivating kids to practise.\n\n\"My son can earn screen time minute by minute when he practises his drums,\" she says.\n\nOn social media, parent Matthew Lorenzon employs a similar tactic. He uses low-cost computer technology to track how long his son practises, and activates a reward when he has finished.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"After ten minutes of practise, the internet turns on,\" Mr Lorenzon says.\n\nHow long do children need to practise?\n\nDr Collins says during the initial habit-forming stage, the practise session might take as little as two minutes.\n\n\"All they have to do is walk to that space, get their musical instrument out, play one thing and put their instrument down,\" she says.\n\n\"Without saying you must practise for a set amount of time, it will naturally happen because we've set them up with a habit to start with,\" she says.\n\nDr Collins emphasises there's no one-size-fits-all approach to determine how long kids should practise.\n\n\"It should be something that is talked through and monitored by both parents and their instrumental teacher,\" she says.\n\nThis should take into account the child's age, how long they've been playing the instrument, their learning style and the expectations of their parents and teachers.\n\n\"It should change regularly as the student improves as a player, strengthens their attention span and needs greater challenge,\" Dr Collins says.\n\nAs a harpist, Lang uses something called the Pomodoro Technique for her own practise routine.\n\nMany might already be familiar with the method from the workplace or studying.\n\n\"I would put on a timer for about 20 minutes to sit and play,\" she says.\n\nIf she's in flow when the timer goes off, Lang will carry on. But if the practise isn't going well, Lang will get up and do something else before continuing.\n\nEven though Lang plays the harp professionally, she doesn't believe in practising for hours. The limit of her attention span is about 45 minutes.\n\n\"That's the maximum sustained time that I can practise before I'm not able to place my attention on what I'm doing.\"\n\nShould kids still practise on a bad day?\n\nBoth Lang and Dr Collins emphasise that practise is about the daily process of learning music instead of tallying accomplishments.\n\n\"Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down, but ultimately, it's always going generally up,\" Dr Collins says.\n\nLang explains why it's not a straightforward process.\n\n\"[Just like adults], kids are not the same every day, and you can't set the same expectations from day to day,\" she says.\n\nShe describes how at the end of school terms when kids are tired, they're not able to learn new things.\n\nAfter the holiday, \"they come back and they are like sponges for instructions,\" Lang says.\n\n\"The important thing is that they just consistently persist,\" Lang says.",

        "text": "Iron ore is the economic lifeblood of Western Australia.\n\nLast year alone, a quarter of the state government's entire revenue came from iron ore royalties, flowing directly into state coffers from the red dirt of the Pilbara.\n\nThe government\u2019s iron ore royalty receipts increased by 8 per cent to $9.4 billion in 2023.\n\nBut the WA sector is about to face a new competitor in the form of the Simandou mine in the African nation of Guinea.\n\nSimandou holds one of the largest untapped high-grade iron ore deposits in the world.\n\nWhen is export slated to begin?\n\nAfter setbacks and delays, the massive mine is finally on track to deliver a fresh wave of high-grade iron ore to the market.\n\nSimandou in Guinea holds one of the world's largest untapped high-grade iron ore deposits. (Instagram: Rio Tinto)\n\nExport is slated to start by the end of the year, according to Rio Tinto, the principal investor in the region.\n\nIt expects production to ramp up over 30 months to a capacity of 60 million tonnes per year.\n\nAnd the iron ore from the Simandou deposit is expected to fetch a high price too.\n\nResources analyst Tim Treadgold said this was due to the grading process.\n\nTim Treadgold says the iron ore desposit at Simandou is very high grade. ( ABC News: Angela Ho )\n\nThe percentage of iron in the ore at Simandou is \"very high and very good\" at 65 per cent compared with the Pilbara's iron ore, which has \"dropped\" to an average of 61 per cent.\n\nWhile a few percentage points may not seem like much, a higher grade can indicate fewer impurities, meaning the commodity will fetch a higher price.\n\nCould Simandou be the 'Pilbara killer'?\n\nNot likely.\n\nThe project has been dubbed the 'Pilbara killer' for its potential to dethrone Australia's economic crown jewel.\n\nBut some economists and mining analysts believe the title is nothing more than a snappy headline.\n\nIron ore royalties account for a significant part of WA's income. (ABC Pilbara: Laura Birch)\n\nWA exported nearly 950 million tonnes of iron ore according to the state government's 2024 iron ore profile, making WA the largest iron ore supplier in the world and accounting for 38 per cent of global supply in 2023.\n\n\"Put it in perspective \u2014 60 million tonnes against [around] 900 million tonnes. Well, it's not even 10 per cent. It's not going to put WA out of business,\" Mr Treadgold said.\n\nHe also pointed out that mines start closing the moment they open because resources are finite.\n\n\"Mines are closing every day, and you need new mines to come online to fill the gap. It's a perfectly natural process,\" he said.\n\nEnd of an era with last train from WA iron ore mine Photo shows Empty iron ore wagons on train tracks in bushland near Kalgoorlie. WA's Yilgarn region has been home to iron ore mining on and off since the 1950s, but the final trainload of the steel-making ingredient has arrived at Esperance Port.\n\nChina is the largest market for WA's iron ore exports, followed by Japan and South Korea.\n\nIron ore production rose rapidly from the 2000s to the mid-2010s, in large part due to demand from China.\n\nBut Chinese steel production appears to be peaking, as the country shifts towards recycling its own scrap steel like the US and Europe.\n\nMr Treadgold said this \"natural progression\" meant less reliance on raw iron ore, with recycled steel becoming a main source.\n\n\"All the iron ore that's been turned into steel over the last couple of hundred years is still out there somewhere,\" he said.\n\n\" You can call it an above ground mine. There's an enormous industry involved in collecting scrap and reproducing it. \"\n\nBut Mr Treadgold believed this did not pose a real threat to the local iron ore sector, as WA could provide high-grade supplementary \"top-ups\" to production, finding a \"new place in the pecking order\".\n\nMatt Grudnoff, a senior economist at the Australia Institute, agreed the impact from Simandou was going to be far from dramatic.\n\nMatt Grundoff doesn't expect to see any dramatic effect from the output of the Simandou mine. (Supplied)\n\n\"If it has an impact, it will be over the longer term, and we will see the WA economy adjust over time,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it would necessarily spell the doom of the WA economy. It's likely just to see a slowdown in growth.\"\n\nSo what is the risk?\n\nWhile short-term effects aren't imminent, the WA economy's dependence on the resources sector has long raised eyebrows among leading national economists.\n\nIron ore production in WA rose rapidly from the 2000s to the mid-2010s. ( ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni )\n\n\"Financial planners will tell you to not put all your eggs in one basket. Absolutely, the WA economy has too many eggs in the iron or the resource basket,\" Mr Grudnoff said.\n\n\"Economic history is littered with examples of economies that were overly specialised, and then something came along and disrupted that market \u2026 and so those economies have withered and died.\"\n\nReducing WA's reliance on iron ore easier said than done Photo shows A dump truck emptying a pile of red dirt into a very large mine - there are hills in the background. Whether WA can ever develop industries to replace iron ore is a pressing question that appears to have few answers in Treasurer Rita Saffioti's inaugural budget.\n\nThe best economies are diversified but Mr Grudnoff conceded this was \"easier said than done\".\n\nIt's difficult to predict ahead of time what areas are beneficial to diversity into, according to Mr Grudnoff.\n\n\"It's the government's job, not necessarily to pick winners, but to allow the economy to be able to grow into areas that it is particularly good at and expand in those areas,\" he said.\n\nBut what if demand did dry up?\n\nHouse prices and unemployment rates in WA would be affected.\n\nWith mining workers typically earning high wages, the sudden loss of employment would have an \"immediate downward impact on house prices\", as unemployed workers rush to sell, unable to service a mortgage.\n\nConfidence WA well-placed to weather iron ore price slump Photo shows Iron ore stockpiles line up on a coastline China's cooling property market has seen iron ore prices tumble faster than expected this year, and the decline could see $3 billion wiped from the federal budget. How concerned should WA be?\n\n\"Yes, we would definitely see perhaps an uptick in unemployment. Yes, house prices in particular would be impacted by a slowdown,\" Mr Grudnoff said.\n\n\"We've seen this over decades, where the boom and bust in the mining industry has caused these ups and downs in the housing market.\n\n\"But more broadly, I think the economy would continue on, just perhaps at a slower rate.\"\n\nThe state budget forecasts WA's iron ore royalty income will drop to $5.7 billion in 2027-28, but that\u2019s based on the assumption the iron ore price will return to its long-term average.",

(AAP Image: Russell Freeman)\n\nAlmost $35,000 in recruitment costs were also incurred to employ Department of Families, Seniors, Disability Services, and Child Safety director-general Belinda Drew.\n\nThe total recruitment bill for all four appointments came in at about $162,500.\n\nThe government would not say why it was necessary to spend money on recruitment services, and it also would not explain the services that were provided to them.\n\nIn a one-line statement, a Crisafulli government spokeswoman said: \"Queensland's director-general appointments deliver a mix of experience and new energy and allow the government to deliver on its commitment of a fresh start.\"\n\nLabor also used recruitment services\n\nContract disclosures from the Public Sector Commission show the former Labor government also used external recruitment searches to hire department heads.\n\nThis included five recruitment services in their last year in power that collectively cost more than $207,000.\n\nCorporate job growth outstrips rise in frontline roles Photo shows Top of 1 William Street building in Brisbane CBD, taken from South Bank with bougainvillea flowers in the foreground. New data to be released today with Queensland's state budget reveals the state's public service has added about 11,700 full time equivalent employees in the past year.\n\nThe LNP government has confirmed five new directors-general were recently recruited through non-advertised processes.\n\nUnder treasurer Paul Williams was also identified following a recruitment search for a new chief executive officer for Queensland Treasury Corporation.\n\nDirectors-general are the most senior public servants in the Queensland government and can earn bigger salaries than the ministers they serve.\n\nThe most senior director-general under former premier Steven Miles was Mike Kaiser, who headed up Department of Premier and Cabinet.\n\nMr Kaiser was among the ten directors-general who left their roles when the LNP took office \u2014 most through mutual separation or termination.\n\nWhile in opposition, the LNP was critical of Mr Kaiser's appointment to the top job. He had previously served briefly as a state Labor MP in the earlier 2000s.\n\nPremier David Crisafulli appointed Damien Walker to succeed Mr Kaiser as director-general of the department.",

As a share of the economy, it reached 30 per cent after slipping to 27.8 per cent during the depths of the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe federal government is by far the biggest tax collector, bringing in $649 billion, an increase of 5.1 per cent.\n\nBut most states lifted their tax collections by far more. Victoria had the biggest increase, by a substantial 14.2 per cent, followed by NSW (11.8 per cent), South Australia (11.3 per cent) and Queensland (10 per cent).\n\nOn a per capita basis, federal taxation collections lifted by 2.6 per cent to $24,097 per person. This includes personal, company, superannuation and fringe benefits taxes.\n\nThe Victorian government lifted its tax hit per person by a nation-leading 9.5 per cent to a record $6348. In NSW, it grew by 8.8 per cent to $6016 while in Queensland, it increased by 6.6 per cent to $5051.\n\nDefying the trend was the ACT government where tax per person actually fell by one per cent to $5551.",

        "text": "Moses gathered the Eels playing group into a huddle and urged them to stay composed. The Tigers players were scattered across the field, with nobody looking or talking to each other.\n\nBut Moses\u2019 defining moment came in the 54th minute, when Tigers winger Sunia Turuva and Eels forward Luca Moretti were binned for their part in a melee that had spilled over the sideline at CommBank Stadium.\n\nHe finished with four try assists, including the kick for Simonsson, and a cutout ball for Josh Addo-Carr\u2019s first four-pointer.\n\nMoses returned from a foot injury to play his first game of the season, and was sensational in the 38-22 win over the Wests Tigers on Easter Monday.\n\nJones said of Moses\u2019 leadership at that crucial stage of the game: \u201cIt was going to be [interesting] how both teams responded to what had just happened \u2026 which team could get their focus the quickest. And that was Parramatta under Mitch. He gave them the drive and direction.\n\n\u201cMitch\u2019s ability to get the players together and work together, they kept fighting for each other.\n\n\u201cWith Mitchell coming back, you could also see the quality of Rylsey\u2019s coaching coming through. You need someone on the field who coaches and runs the team how you want them to be coached, and Mitchell does that. If you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d\n\nFive-eighth Dylan Brown was arguably the biggest winner from Moses return, and relished being able to return to his running game rather than steer the team around the park. Seeing Brown run for more than 160m and relishing the freedom, however, must have Newcastle scratching their head when you consider they paid him $13m over the next ten years to run the show like Moses.\n\nJones said of Brown: \u201cHe ran the ball more, he was noticed because he was such a great runner of the ball, and people tried to make him into something he\u2019s not. Unfortunately, like anything, we get influenced by outside views.",

        "text": "It has just gone midday and the warm and genial commentator orders a large cappuccino. When pressed again about his ability, or inability, to retain quiz-winning volumes of general knowledge, he has a logical explanation: race callers, he says, train their brains to forget. \u201cWe are learning and sieving, learning and sieving, learning and sieving,\u201d he says. Hill says that he can memorise a field of 15 horses in under five minutes, call them in a race and then forget them three minutes later. \u201cI don\u2019t retain stuff, I don\u2019t recall stuff,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI listen to the news a lot. I like listening to the news, and I will forget two days later what was in the news.\u201d\n\nHill chose this cafe because it is central to his story. Hill was eight when his father, Trevor, left the family. His brother, Timothy, was six. For the rest of their schooling life they were raised by their single mum, Susan, in her Altona Meadows house, which is just around the corner from Little Rosebery. Hill now lives in his mother\u2019s home, having agreed to buy his brother out when Susan died in August last year. Matt Hill in his favourite local haunt. Credit: PENNY STEPHENS \u201cShe worked so hard to own that home, you know,\u201d Hill says of his emotional attachment to the family house.\n\n\u201cThis area has been my whole life. I played basketball as a kid up the road, and we are literally 20 metres from where I caught the school bus for six years [to St Paul\u2019s College in North Altona].\u201d Hill\u2019s career is intrinsically linked to his mother. As a 15-year-old, she would drive him across the state to pursue his passion \u2013 calling races at Sale, Shepparton, Stawell and even as far afield as Mildura on Melbourne Cup Day. Matt Hill has called eight Melbourne Cups. Credit: Michael Rayner \u201cHer little yellow Toyota probably did about 400,000 clicks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d get on the phone and ring race clubs, and I\u2019d say, \u2018Would you like a race caller for your non-TAB meeting?\u2019 They\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, can you get here?\u2019, and Mum would drive me. \u201cThen what would happen is my grandfather, who loved racing, and so did my grandmother, they would come along, too. So it ended up being a family expedition.\u201d\n\nDespite his tender age and experience, Hill was always welcomed on course, especially at picnic race meetings where they had often relied on untrained members of the public to call their races. During one meeting at Pooncarie in NSW, the publican had a go and was so bad he was booed off the stand. The next year they agreed to give 16-year-old Hill a chance. When he wasn\u2019t crisscrossing the state, teenage Hill and his family would head to Flemington or Moonee Valley. There, he would find a spare seat or hunt out an empty broadcasting box in the grandstand, and call the races on his own. \u201cI should have been out chasing girls or with my mates, but I was honing what I was doing, you know, calling into a tape recorder,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my life, and I loved it. I would never have changed it, you know. I couldn\u2019t wait to get to Flemington and practise calling.\u201d\n\nHill says his mother never passed judgment on his work unless he mentioned it first. Loading \u201cThere\u2019d be times when I\u2019d come home, it might have been the Cox Plate or a big name, and I\u2019d say, \u2018Mum, I stumbled over a name there\u2019, or something, and she\u2019d go, \u2018Oh yeah, I noticed that.\u2019 \u201cShe would listen to everything. Even in her days in the nursing home, she was listening to me call the football on the radio. Half the time, it was a good way of knowing where I was.\u201d Hill still speaks to his father, who lives in Queensland, but says they are not close.\n\n\u201cMum worked at the National Bank, she was a PA, and then Dad was an engineer,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there\u2019s really no radio broadcasting, not even a racing background. I am self-made in a way.\u201d Hill, 44, says he comes to Little Rosebery three days a week. He spreads the newspaper across its wooden tables, studies the formguide and usually opts for something simple, like Vegemite on toast or a BLT, which the cafe has added to its menu especially for its regular guest. But today he is going to venture into uncharted waters. \u201cI\u2019m gonna hedge my bets,\u201d he says in his signature mellifluous tone. \u201cGonna have a smashed avo, and get some bacon on the side.\u201d\n\nI opt for one of their bestsellers \u2013 Thai chilli eggs. Hill is still working through his coffee, but I order a large glass of pear and apple juice to accompany my meal. Hill lives on his own, with his dog, and describes his profession as \u201cthe love of my life\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very cliche to say I am married to the job, but I am because it is my hobby as well. It really is,\u201d he says. \u201cI sort of live to work. I just love it.\u201d The multi-talented sport commentator is lucky to be alive. After he finished year 12, he started running errands at a Melbourne radio station, won a racing industry scholarship at 19 and became Sydney\u2019s main race caller. But it was on assignment in Beijing, calling at the 2008 Olympics for the Macquarie Radio Network, that he fell seriously ill. He was flattened by double pneumonia and his body started shutting down. There were fears he wouldn\u2019t survive.\n\nHill was flown to Hong Kong, where a medical professor, who had worked through the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, \u201cslammed\u201d him with a concoction of antibiotics. It was later discovered he had melioidosis, a bacterial disease spread through soil, air and water that had a 90 per cent death rate. \u201cIt is actually very similar to COVID,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI just happened to be unlucky \u2013 lucky and unlucky at the same time because to be brutally honest, if I were a smoker, if I had an unhealthy lifestyle, I wouldn\u2019t be here. I was young enough to fight it.\u201d Rather than slow him down, the near-death experience pushed Hill to work harder. \u201cAll I ever wanted to do was call at the Olympics,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it just made me so determined after that. It just made me want it more. It made me want to almost kind of prove myself, actually. Like, I felt like I just needed to prove myself again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why ... I saw the illness almost as a weakness, which was a silly thing to do because anyone can get sick, but I wanted to achieve even more then. \u201cSo, in a way you do realise, and I realise it now with the death of my mum some 16 years later, that we are not here for a long time.\u201d Hill called the Olympic rowing for Nine in Paris, as well as the athletics for Nine radio. But he is about to make a bigger splash in AFL. Fox Footy\u2019s Thursday night AFL callers Matt Hill (left) and Mark Howard. This year he is locked in to call 45 games for Fox Footy, alongside Mark Howard on Thursday nights and Dwayne Russell on Sundays, as well as 25 games for SEN radio on Friday nights.\n\nHe will also cover Melbourne\u2019s major race meetings every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. \u201cThis year is going to be the hardest year I\u2019ve ever worked,\u201d he says. \u201cMy biggest challenge, I\u2019ve found, is I naturally have a quick, quick flow because of calling horse races. So I don\u2019t want to sound like it\u2019s a race caller at the football \u2013 that\u2019s my challenge. \u201cBut it is a fast game. You know, you can be saying something, and the ball might go through four pairs of hands. I try and say as many players\u2019 names as I can, and I try to be as accurate as I can.\u201d Hill, who grew up watching and supporting the Western Bulldogs, says it is difficult to pick up footballers\u2019 numbers during a game, so he concentrates on their faces. Or their unique markings. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty old-fashioned approach in that I get Google Images up, and I just look at their faces as if I\u2019m meeting them for the first time,\u201d he says of his AFL preparation.\n\n\u201cYou just put a name to the face. Then I\u2019ll watch their game from the week before, so I\u2019ll study both of the teams from the week before. \u201cAnd then for me, the most important, this is where the race caller comes out in me. I don\u2019t know how many people do this, I have to be there an hour before the game because I want to see them physically in the flesh when they\u2019re warming up. The receipt for our lunch at Little Rosebery cafe. \u201cThen what I tend to do is look for their coloured boots, anything that\u2019s different \u2013 coloured boots, tattoos, strapping is important. \u201cIf there are a couple of players that look the same, and it might be something really simple, like, you know, a little tatt on the left knee or left shin, or just something that \u2013 if the ball\u2019s being given to a player quickly \u2013 I can pick up on who it is quickly.\u201d\n\nOur discussion returns to Hill\u2019s mother and his first Melbourne Cup call without her. \u201cTwo days after Mum died, my brother and I were driving to Tobin Brothers, to the funeral home, and Tim said to me, \u2018What do you reckon Mum would like played at her funeral?\u2019\u201d Hill says. \u201cHe said, \u2018She loved Life Is a Rollercoaster, by Ronan Keating\u2019. Within seconds, it came on the radio. So that was a bit sort of, \u2018Wow, she\u2019s still here.\u2019 \u201cThen on the day of her funeral, the week later, it was announced in the paper that Ronan Keating would sing on Melbourne Cup Day. He sang 30 minutes before the Melbourne Cup. \u201cSo I took that as a little bit of a \u2018she\u2019s still with me\u2019. And, thank Christ, he didn\u2019t sing Life Is a Rollercoaster before the Cup because that would have made me a wreck.\u201d",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nEvening mass held at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris paid tribute to Pope Francis - one of thousands of services around the world remembering the man who led the Roman Catholic church since 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis death was announced on Monday night by Cardinal Kevin Farrell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7.35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalised. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the one, triune God. Thankyou.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 266th pope has been praised for his outreach to the poor and the vulnerable; his concern for the environment; and his efforts to call for peace and seek an end to conflicts - like those in the Middle East, Ukraine and Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor, but alienated many conservatives with his critiques of capitalism and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Argentina, where Pope Francis was born, President Javier Milei released a statement on the Catholic leaders passing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Argentine Republic, a country with a long Catholic tradition and the homeland of Pope Francis, deeply mourns the departure of His Holiness and sends its condolences to the Bergoglio family. The President of the Nation accompanies in this sad moment all those who profess the Catholic faith and who found in the Supreme Pontiff a spiritual leader.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement on social media platform X, French President Emmanuel Macron said this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest. To unite people with one another and with nature. May this hope be reborn endlessly beyond him. To all Catholics, to a grieving world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was admitted to a hospital on February 14th, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalisation of his 12-year papacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis said he wished to be buried not in St Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St Mary Major Basilica across town.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the church where his favourite icon of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani, is located.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2024, Francis reformed the rites to be used for his funeral, simplifying them to emphasise his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says Pope Francis was never afraid of change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was a papacy of firsts. The first Pope to hail from the Americas, the first Jesuit Pope, and the first to take the name of that great champion of the poor St Francis of Assisi. Pope Francis' compassion embraced all humanity and today he will be mourned by Catholics and non Catholics alike.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton praised the Pope's lifestyle and vision for what was possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He lived frugally and simply, above all else, he was driven by Christ's values of mercy and forgiveness. He emphasized those values in his last Christmas address, saying, and I quote 'God's mercy can do all things. It unties every knot. It tears down every wall of division. God's mercy dispels hatred and the spirit of revenge.' With God, may Pope Francis, rest in peace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn St Peter's Square in Rome, thousands of mourners stood beneath the balcony where Pope Francis had blessed the crowd just the day before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany held rosaries and prayed for the pontiff.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome cried.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne person was seen wrapped in the flag of Argentina, the pope\u2019s homeland.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Johann Xavier says he has come to Rome to grieve and pay his respects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are really sad about it. We come from Australia, we are hoping that there was some chance to see him but then we heard about it when we came in here. It pretty much devastated all of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering for morning prayers outside Westminster Cathedral in London, priest Jonathan Beswick says he's deeply saddened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's one of those things you always know where you were when you heard the news. And I had a message from my wife just saying that the Holy Father had died. And I'd actually called her just a few minutes beforehand to come and pray. But the doors were closed. Obviously, the news hadn't got out until that moment. And so I turned around and came back again and just came here for morning prayer. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Cape Town, South Africa, Nazir Reddy is among those gathering at St Mary's Catholic Cathedral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a bit sad especially for all the Catholics around the world, it's a sad day. Many good people have come and passed on and we hope that the next Pope can be as good as the next and leave a good example.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres spoke for many in his tribute.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Early voting has begun for the federal election and millions of Australians are expected to submit their ballot ahead of election day on 3 May.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have spent the last few weeks pledging billions of dollars in commitments as they try to sell voters their vision for Australia's future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's an overview of the major national pledges so far. Scroll down as we've covered topics including Health , Small Business and Industrial Relations , Housing , the Cost of Living , Defence , Indigenous Affairs , Young People , Energy , and Migration .\n\n\n\nHEALTH\n\nLabor\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor hopes to incentivise more doctors to bulk bill patients as part of an $8.5 billion boost to Medicare , which also includes $400 million to train more nurses and doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will also open an extra 50 urgent care clinics \u2014 on top of the 87 already operating \u2014 by June 2026, at a cost of $644 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen suffering from endometriosis, pelvic pain or menopause will have access to more specialised clinics as well as cheaper medicines, with Labor pledging a $573 million boost to women\u2019s health.\n\n\n\nThis includes adding certain oral contraceptives, endometriosis medication and IVF medication to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has promised to cap the cost of most prescriptions to $25 (currently $31.60) \u2014 and $7.70 for concession card holders \u2014 by January 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor will expand access to free mental health support as part of a $1 billion investment in mental health services, which will include upgrading or establishing more than 100 mental health clinics with varying specialities. These will be supported by training an extra 1,200 mental health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has matched Labor's Medicare promise, with a $9 billion commitment including $400 million in financial incentives for junior doctors who enter general practice.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Billions pledged: What the parties are promising for your health this election\n\nDutton has also pledged $400 million towards youth mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes raising the number of subsidised psychology sessions from 10 to 20, restoring them to levels set by the Morrison government during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has also promised to go ahead with cuts to the price of medicines on the PBS as well as boost funding to women\u2019s health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens want to expand Medicare to include dental care and mental health.\n\n\n\nSMALL BUSINESS / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nCoalition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has pledged to make the small business instant asset write-off a permanent tax deduction, boosting it to $30,000 for businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton also wants to increase the number of small businesses in Australia by 350,000 over four years by offering tax incentives that encourage reinvestment.\n\n\n\nUnder the entrepreneurship accelerator scheme, businesses would pay tax on 75 per cent of their first $100,000 of taxable income, and on 50 per cent of the second $100,000. The ratio of tax paid will increase in the subsequent two years of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall and medium size businesses will also be able claim up to $20,000 in staff meals each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton has also walked away from plans to stop public servants from working from home , although he still plans to cut 41,000 Canberra-based jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has vowed to protect penalty rates for workers , and said it would enshrine them into law if it is re-elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also ban non-compete clauses, enabling workers earning under $175,000 to more easily switch jobs to a competing employer or to start a competing business.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March , the government legislated an extension to the $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses but has not committed to making it permanent.\n\n\n\nHOUSING\n\nBoth major parties have their sights set on making housing more affordable, although critics say their policies could drive up prices .\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor will expand its 5 per cent deposit scheme so that every first home buyer is eligible. The government will act as a guarantor for buyers to purchase with a smaller deposit (instead of the usual 20 per cent) saving them from having to pay lenders mortgage insurance. There will be no income limits or caps on places.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also build 100,000 new affordable homes exclusively for first home buyers, with construction to start in 2026/27.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore first home buyers will be able to access the Help to Buy shared equity loan scheme , which allows them to buy with a deposit of 2 per cent if they are willing to give the government a 30-40 per cent stake. Income caps will be increased from $90,000 to $100,000 for individuals, and property caps will also be increased.\n\n\n\nFirst-home buyers will get more support under the 2025 federal budget. Source: SBS News In addition to these measures, the government has committed $100 million to refurbish and build more crisis and transitional housing for women leaving domestic violence or at risk of homelessness.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor hopes to speed up the construction of homes as part of its existing target to build 1.2 million homes by 2029, pledging $626 million towards apprenticeship incentives for construction workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nApprentices in housing construction will receive an extra $10,000 at intervals, with the first payment at six months and the last when they complete their training.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Australians struggling to put together a deposit, a Dutton-led government would allow Australians to access $50,000 of their superannuation to buy a first home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has also pledged $5 billion for building infrastructure such as sewerage and water to support the construction of 500,000 new homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst home buyers will also be allowed to claim tax deductions on interest payments against the first $650,000 of their mortgage. The scheme will be available for the first five years for those who purchase a newly built home.\n\n\n\nBusinesses employing apprentices in areas where there's a skills shortage can get $12,000 a year for the first two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton says the housing crisis has been exacerbated by record levels of migration, peaking at 536,000 in 2022-23.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has pledged to cut net migration levels by 100,000 place s, which will include lowering the permanent migration program by 25 per cent and a 30,000 reduction in the number of foreign students starting higher education each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth major parties support a two-year ban on foreign investors from buying established homes, a policy that came into effect on 1 April 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition will also scrap the government's $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, which aims to deliver 55,000 social and affordable homes over five years.\n\n\n\nGreens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens will make housing a priority in the event of a hung parliament, calling for reforms to negative gearing and the 50 per cent capital gains tax (CGT) discount.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder its proposal, existing investors that negatively gear properties will be allowed to continue doing so but new investors will only be allowed to negatively gear one property in the future. CGT would be phased out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minor party is also pledging to cap rent increases to 2 per cent across two years.\n\n\n\nCOST OF LIVING\n\nLabor\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian households and businesses will receive an extra $150 in energy bill relief if Labor is re-elected . The money will appear as a credit on people's power bills in two $75 instalments over the last six months of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the government legislated two tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers. This means anyone earning more than $45,000 will save $268 in 2026/27 and $536 the year after. The Coalition has vowed to repeal the measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery taxpayer would also be eligible to claim an instant $1,000 tax deduction for work expenses, without filling out paperwork or receipts.\n\n\n\nLabor has pledged to provide three days of subsidised childcare per week for every family and scrap the activity test for families earning less than $530,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will also make medicines more affordable by capping most PBS prescriptions to $25 by January 2026 and $7.70 for concession card holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has matched Labor's promise for cheaper medicines.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also provide a one-off $1,200 tax offset to everyone earning between $48,000 and $104,000 when they lodge their 2025-26 tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorists can also expect to save money at the bowser, with a temporary fuel excise cut for the next 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $6 billion pledge will see fuel excise cut from 50 cents to 25 cents a litre, and is estimated to save a one-car household an average of $14 a week or roughly $700 over one year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians who want to buy a new ute will also benefit from the Coalition's plan to scrap penalties for high polluting vehicles due to take effect on 1 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton says he also has an aspiration to tackle bracket creep \u2014 so that personal income tax brackets rise regularly in line with measures like inflation \u2014 which would mean people keep more of their income. But this would only be looked at after the budget is in order and he has not provided a timeframe for this.\n\n\n\nGreens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are pushing for a $29 billion early childhood package, which would give families access to 50 hours of free childcare a week and extend pre-school to 30 hours a week for all three and four-year-olds.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts policy platform includes capping rental increases and making unlimited rent rises illegal, wiping student debt, and heavily subsidising public transport so that buses, trains, ferries and tram trips only cost 50 cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt plans to raise $514 billion to fund these commitments by introducing a 10 per cent tax for 150 of Australia's billionaires, and 40 per cent tax on excess profits for corporations with over $100 million in turnover.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party has also flagged changes to negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount , which it says would lower housing costs.\n\n\n\nDEFENCE\n\nLabor\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has vowed to bolster defence spending by $50.3 billion over the next decade , growing it from 2 per cent of GDP to 2.33 per cent by 2033-34.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Labor and the Coalition have pledged to seek an alternate buyer for the Port of Darwin and return it to Australian hands. It was leased in 2015 to Beijing-controlled Landbridge Group for 99 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton is yet to pledge a defence spending target but is expected to make an announcement ahead of Anzac Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has already promised to spend $3 billion on 28 extra fighter jets, increasing Australia's fleet of F-35s from 72 to 100.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The billion-dollar problem that neither Albanese nor Dutton wants to become a big issue\n\nGreens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens want to save $77 billion by cancelling AUKUS and severing what the party says is a \"reliance on US, UK and Israeli weapons supplies\".

However, this was blocked by both the Coalition and Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis forced the government to pass ministerial direction 111 , which has enabled it to reduce numbers by slowing visa processing and assigning quotas for international students to each university.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare told SBS Malayalam executive producer Deeju Sivadas there is no official cap but the ministerial direction would be used to get international student numbers back to where they were pre-pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Jason Bryce noticed it during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis local bank branch closed, as did three ATMs. Then the local supermarket temporarily went cashless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Card companies were talking about the dirtiness of cash, and people were saying, 'We've got to go cashless',\" Bryce told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That led to a big decline in the use of cash, and it looked like the cashless society was inevitable.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE A surcharge for cash payments? What could happen as Australians ditch notes and coins\n\nThe loss of the ability to pay in cash spurred Bryce to launch an advocacy group Cash Welcome, which encourages the use of cash to ensure it remains an option for consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group is calling for a nationwide campaign on Tuesday to get people to withdraw some cash and \"remind the banks and the government that cash is important to Australians\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Have money in your pocket so you can pay with stuff if you need to, but [Tuesday], particularly, it's like a vote against their cashless Australia,\" Bryce said.\n\n\n\nIs a cashless society inevitable?\n\nAround 1.5 million Australians mostly use coins and paper notes to make purchases every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's been a steady decline in the use of cash \u2014 and it took a new turn during COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, the share of in-person transactions made with cash halved, from 32 per cent to 16 per cent, according to the latest data from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).\n\n\n\n\n\nRBA's next report is due this year, but in the meantime, reports from other groups indicate the outlook for the prevalence of cash looks grim.\n\n\n\n\n\nCash will make up only 7 per cent of in-person transaction value by 2030, a drop from the current 10 per cent.\n\n\n\nAustralians' most preferred payment method is prepaid or debit cards, according to a report from payments provider Worldpay. Source: SBS News That figure, from a new report from global payments provider Worldpay, also shows Australians' most preferred payment method is prepaid or debit cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the group expects digital wallets will soon be the preferred option, capturing just over half of online and 38 per cent of in-person transaction value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cash's share of in-person shopping value dropped by more than two-thirds from 2014 to 2024. Yet the story of cash in Australia is one of a staunch defence,\" the report said.\n\n\n\nAustralians mostly use debit cards or prepaid methods for online purchases, with credit cards a close second, according to a report by payments provider Worldpay. Source: SBS News The closure of ATMs is also another factor attributed to the decline in the use of cash.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngel Zhong, associate professor of finance at RMIT University, believes Australia will be a functionally cashless society by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means the majority of payments will be in digital method. But it doesn't mean that you can't use cash,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I don't think people need to panic when it comes to the movement towards a cashless society, because we're talking about a functionally cashless society, not a fully cashless society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, RBA governor Michele Bullock said cash would \"be around probably for another 10 years\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Cash used to be king; but more people are saying no to coins and notes SBS News 12/04/2024 07:10 Play\n\nWhat are countries doing about cash's viability?\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 99.3 per cent of people in urban areas are within 1.6km of a free-to-use cash access point offering withdrawals, while this drops slightly to 98.7 per cent in rural areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome countries, such as Spain, France, Norway, and Denmark, as well as some states in the United States, have implemented mandates that require businesses to accept cash.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the federal government announced Australia would join the ranks from 1 January 2026. This mandate would require businesses supplying essential goods and services to accept cash, though details about which specific businesses have not yet been outlined.\n\n\n\nWhile Australia is moving towards a cashless society, cash usage remains relatively higher than in some Asian markets where the shift to digital payments is more pronounced, according to the Worldpay Global Payments report. Source: SBS News \"Because of the government mandate, I think we are on the right balance ... to ensure financial inclusion. That means those who want to use cash will get their cash,\" Zhong said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mandate will also phase out cheques \u2014 they will stop being issued by 30 June 2028 and will no longer be accepted from 30 September 2029.\n\n\n\nWhy do people prefer cash?\n\nExorbitant transaction surcharges and fees, security of your personal information, and reliability during tech outages are just some of the reasons why people prefer to stick to cash.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, shoppers at Coles and Woolworths reported being unable to make purchases during the CrowdStrike outage .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That incident, along with the others like the Optus incident, they highlighted some of the vulnerability of digital payments,\" Zhong said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Bryce, the Optus outage underscored the importance of carrying cash.\n\n\n\nA graph showing how the number of bank branches and ATMs has fallen in Australia. Source: SBS News \"I couldn't catch the train, couldn't make a payment because I was caught without cash,\" Bryce said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think there's been a big realisation in Australia that you don't want to get caught out without a $50 note or a $20 note in your pocket, because you don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, amid the gradual decline in cash use for transactions, demand for banknotes spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of banknotes in circulation increased by 22 per cent, or $19 billion, between March 2020 and its peak in December 2022, according to the RBA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, the central bank said, suggested banknotes were being hoarded to store wealth or for precautionary savings.\n\n\n\n",

It's really tricky to play a board game through Zoom, honestly, but he'll try! So he'll actually roll the dice for her and he will try to move the coins and try to... but I can tell that the bonding is really hard through the screen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nViji's here on a tourist visa as the family wait for her parent visa application to be processed.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer daughter, Supriya, says it's not easy knowing her mother is alone in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's been almost five years for her, because it's 2025 now. So the reason is because at that time, actually, my dad passed away towards the end of 2020, so I'm an only child, so she's basically there all alone because her brothers and sisters, don't live in the same city. So she's living all by herself in that house there and it is getting pretty lonely because of that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nViji is not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Labor came to power the backlog of parent visa applications has ballooned from 120- to 150 thousand.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite doubling the annual intake and issuing nearly 26-thousand parents visas, the average wait time remains 31 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wait time can be about half that, but only if you can pay 48,000 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Supriya's husband Mayur, the cost is difficult to justify for a 14 year wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If this was just a normal visa where it wasn't a contributory type, I understand, a 14 year wait, okay, fair enough. But this is contributory where we're playing a lot of money to bring her over here. So, certainly a 14 year wait, when you're paying so much. I don't think is reasonable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA Migration Review commissioned by Labor in 2022 described the parent visa system as cruel and unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggesting changes like a visa lottery or increasing temporary visas, the review also pointed out that the backlog could cause skilled migrants to look elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to a Western Sydney forum during the campaign, the Prime Minister says he is aware of the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to bear in mind for many of the residents in Western Sydney, too. They don't want, people who are migrants, Mum and Dad to have no access here either.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when asked by SBS ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Migrants don't want Mum and Dad to be locked out of the country. Will Labor increase the cap on parent visas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we'll do is we'll work through an orderly migration program.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition has pledged to slash permanent migration by 25 per cent in an effort to free up housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton has maintained he\u2019d reveal which visa categories he\u2019d cut after the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is until today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is the coalition planning to cut parent visas?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've said in relation to migration, and again this is a big difference between the two parties. We're going to cut migration by 25\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Will you cut parent visas? \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a significant contributor to young Australians locked out of housing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Will you reduce parent visas?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In relation to parents, I've been clear about this - it's an important part - an important part of the migration program. And we're not going to reduce those.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder pressure over high migration, Labor has had little appetite to address the growing parent visa backlog, even as demand for skilled migrants grows.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Coalition pledges to slash permanent migration to free up housing - the question remains - which visas would be cut?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbul Rizvi is the former Immigration Department Deputy Secretary, he says it will likely be parent visas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mr Dutton's announcement that he will reduce the migration program from 185,000 to 140,000. Undoubtedly the first category he will cut is parents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile cost of living reigns supreme in the suburbs, it's not the only issue that will sway voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to be casting a vote based on a major economic policy because that actually wouldn't be something I'm looking into that much, but this is something that actually cuts close to home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this message for both major parties in an election that could be won or lost in the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thousands of people similar to us. Who are also waiting. So our request to the government, whoever that is, is to consider and not slash the parents visa, the contributory visa so that we can bring our family back here.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Church, has died, the Vatican has announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis died at his residence in the Vatican's Casa Santa Marta on Easter Monday, the Vatican's news service said, after suffering a stroke and irreversible heart failure. He was 88.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow, I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell said, announcing Francis' death on the Vatican's TV channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised.\"\n\n\n\nThe Vatican has a set of succession protocols that follow the announcement of a pope's death, marking the end of one papacy and the start of the next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese have been practised over centuries and some date back to ancient Rome.\n\n\n\nConfirmation and funeral preparations\n\nFarrell, the pope's camerlengo or chamberlain, officially confirms the death. He then seals the pope's private apartment and prepares the funeral.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camerlengo and three assistants decide when the pope's coffin will be taken into St Peter's Basilica for public viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also ensure that the pope's so-called 'Fisherman's Ring' \u2014 a signet ring traditionally given to the pope during his papal inauguration, used to sign and seal documents \u2014 and his lead seal are broken, so they cannot be used by anyone else. No autopsy is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe death triggers a nine-day mourning period called the Novendiale.\n\n\n\nThe date of the funeral and burial will be decided by the cardinal. It will likely be held in St Peter's Square four to six days after the death. Cardinals will meet on Tuesday to start planning the funeral.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pope approved funeral protocols for himself last year, opting to cut some papal funeral traditions and simplify certain rituals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis's body was to be laid on Tuesday AEST in a single coffin of wood and zinc in the Santa Marta chapel, ahead of the transfer to St Peter's Basilica to lie in state, likely on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis said in 2023 he would like to be buried at the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, departing from the tradition of almost 100 popes who chose to be buried in the Vatican Grottoes.\n\n\n\nPast popes have been buried in three-layered coffins, but Francis has chosen a single coffin made of zinc and wood.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe College of Cardinals oversees day-to-day business during what is called the interregnum \u2014 the period between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor. They have limited power, and much of the central Church administration grinds to a halt.\n\n\n\nElecting a new pope\n\nThe conclave \u2014 a secretive voting ritual to elect a new pope \u2014 starts in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel between 15 and 20 days after the death. The cardinals, who are confined to the Vatican for the duration of the conclave, decide the exact day.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll cardinals under the age of 80 can take part in the secret ballot. They need a majority of at least two-thirds plus one to elect the new pope, so the voting can take several rounds spread over numerous days.\n\n\n\nWhen the conclave is concluded, the new pope is asked if he accepts and what name he wishes to take.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world learns a pope has been elected when an official burns the paper ballots with special chemicals to make white smoke pour from the chapel's chimney. They use other chemicals to make black smoke, which indicates an inconclusive vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dean of the College of Cardinals steps onto the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica to announce the new pope, who then appears and gives the crowd his blessing.\n\n\n\n",

So, a 14-years wait, when you're paying so much, I don't think is reasonable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are thousands of people in our position, so my sincere request to whoever forms government after the election is to increase the numbers of parent visas so the wait time isn't so long.\"\n\n\n\n'The offset would be in the billions'\n\nDespite the increasing demand for parent visas, political pressure over Labor's handling of immigration \u2014 which hit record levels in the post-COVID-19 bounce back \u2014 has left little appetite to reform this complex system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Parkinson Migration Review commissioned by Labor in 2022 found the parent visa system was \"cruel and unnecessary\" and forced families to wait for a visa \"that would never come\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has recommended changes such as increasing the number and length of temporary visas issued for parents, as well as potentially introducing a visa lottery.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer deputy secretary of the Immigration Department Abul Rizvi said a lottery would be \"unfair to those who are already in the list and have been waiting for years\".\n\n\n\n\n\nRizvi said that, while it's important for the government to offer skilled migrants the chance of family reunion, bringing aging migrants into the country is costly to the already stretched health and aged care system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As someone who advocated for parent visas to be increased, the trade off is Treasury will say to you: 'Okay, then you find the offsets in the budget to pay for this.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the offsets would be in the billions.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Nige has waited 16 years to reunite with his wife.

Our son can hardly speak Tamil now \u2026 so to have family here would help him with the language and impart the Indian culture, which is important,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've worked in Australia for two decades, we pay our taxes, so I feel like we're being treated a bit unfairly compared to other Australians.\"\n\n\n\nMajor-party migration agendas\n\nSpeaking at a Western Sydney Forum a fortnight ago, the prime minister said he was well aware that this issue was one faced by some members of his audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we have to bear in mind for many residents in Western Sydney who are migrants \u2026 they don\u2019t want Mum and Dad to have no access here either forever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when asked if he would commit to increasing the cap, he only said: \"What we\u2019ll do is run an orderly migration program.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has said it will continue its current plans to reduce migration as per Treasury forecasts, with no new immigration-policy announcements throughout the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasury forecasts net migration to return to 260,000 by 2024-25, and 225,000 the following year, although it previously underestimated net migration numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Coalition has said it would reveal details of its planned 25 per cent reduction to the permanent migration program after the election, which would shrink the intake from 180,000 per year to 135,000 \u2014 a reduction of 45,000 visas.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition to cut international student numbers by 80,000, raise visa application fees\n\nDutton has also said a Coalition government will cut net overseas migration \u2014 i.e. the difference between the number of people entering and leaving Australia \u2014 by 100,000 places.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration minister Tony Burke told SBS the Coalition\u2019s proposed cuts to permanent migration were \"reckless\" and the pledge to not cut parent visas would mean deeper cuts would be made to the skilled visa category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don\u2019t see how Peter Dutton hits his targets without us having fewer of the people we need to work in aged care, pick fruit and build houses.

Well, with the Greens in the balance of power, we will force Labor to do what is needed. We know that it's time to end those insidious, dangerous gambling ads that are wrecking families and destroying people's lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says the Labor party is considering changes to parent visas to tackle a backlog that has seen wait times for visa applicants extend up to 50 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says the government's inquiry has found that between 2010 and 2022, the applications backlog more than doubled to 120,000 from around 35,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Parkinson review was one of the three reviews that took place that showed the mess that we had to clean up. The Department simply didn't have enough staff. We are working on these issues, but we inherited an absolute mess, when we came to office.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Peter Dutton has pledged a Coalition government would not cut Australia's annual parent visa intake.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor increased the intake from 4,500 to 8,500 when it came to government.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork is underway to establish Tasmania's first Sea Country Indigenous Protected Area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe listing will support conservation, protection and management of the area, which includes ecologically important seagrass beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal for the Protected Area will focus around the Furneaux Islands in Bass Strait also known as Tayaritja.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Beth Strain from the University of Tasmania says a management plan is being developed in a collaboration between her campus, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, and Deakin University in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're aiming to do is basically to primarily map the seagrass beds around the Furneaux Group, because basically they're large and extensive, probably thought to be the largest around Southern Australia, but they haven't been extensively mapped before this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the Defence Secretary has become embroiled in a second scandal over his use of the Signal app.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been reported that Pete Hegseth shared details of a March attack on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis in a message group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell has dismissed the reports, saying in a post on X that he believes it's a witch-hunt by the media to destroy anyone committed to Trump's agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Democrat lawmakers have called for Mr Hegseth to be sacked, saying his actions have put lives at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris has held its first Easter celebration since reopening to the public in December 2024, following years of reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gathering has brought together leaders and faithful from various Christian denominations for a shared moment of prayer, unity, and reflection beneath the newly restored Gothic vaults of the centuries-old cathedral.\n\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop Laurent Ulrich has delivered an address to worshippers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, welcome to this renovated cathedral that some of you are of course discovering today, I mean discovering it by being inside it, because I imagine that many of you saw it on the 7th and 8th of December. It\u2019s a great joy. A great celebration, a great time of peace in our hearts and, we hope, a great peace that rises in the hearts of all people to fight against the spirit of division.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nBig guns Lachlan Kennedy and Gout Gout have both been knocked out of the $40,000 Stawell Gift foot race.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points Five people from two universities in the US were able to see a colour not usually visible to humans.\n\nScientists made this possible by using lasers to optically stimulate individual photoreceptor cells on the retina.\n\nThe previously unseen hue colour has been named 'olo'.\n\nA new colour has been discovered, but so far, just five people in the world have been able to see it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe colour was identified as part of research done at the University of California (UC), Berkeley in the United States and has been called 'olo'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who viewed the colour described it as a blueish-green of unprecedented saturation.\n\n\n\nHow was olo discovered?\n\nThey were all participants who had laser pulses shot into their eyes as part of a scientific experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was done by \"optically stimulating individual photoreceptor cells on the retina\" through a system the researchers dubbed 'Oz'.\n\n\n\nWhile the human eye has three types of cone cells \u2014 S, L, and M, with each one sensitive to different wavelengths of blue, red, and green, respectively \u2014 their spectral sensitivities overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCones convert light energy into electrical signals and specialise in sensing light that is responsible for colour vision and sharp, daytime vision.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the research paper, in normal vision, \"any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighbouring L and/or S cones\", because its function overlaps with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, through the use of the Oz system, the cones can be stimulated separately, \"which in principle would send a colour signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Theoretically, Oz expands the natural human colour gamut to any (L, M, and S) colour coordinate,\" the paper stated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Colour matching confirms that our attempt at stimulating only M cones displays a colour that lies beyond the natural human gamut.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe truest version of olo would therefore be defined as \"pure M activation\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Stem cells from sac could be breakthrough for stroke victims SBS News 20/02/2018 02:54 Play\n\nAdvancing research around colour blindness\n\nThe research paper suggests the Oz system, which discovered olo, may provide insight into the possibility of enabling a wider array of colour vision in people who are colourblind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oz can be programmed to probe the plasticity of human colour vision,\" the paper said.\n\n\n\nSeeing olo\n\nWhile olo may become the most talked about colour this week, it is unlikely to become the Pantone colour of the year any time soon, due to the fact it is inaccessible to the human eye without retinal stimulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who took part in the visual experiment and viewed olo were scientists, three from UC Berkeley who are co-authors on the paper and two from the University of Washington, who participated in the research.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been reported that the name 'olo' was chosen as it denotes the binary 010, indicating that of the L, M, and S cones, only the M cones are switched on.\n\n\n\n'Open to argument'\n\nProfessor John Barbur, a vision scientist at the University of London in the United Kingdom, is reported to have said that while the research was a \"technological feat\" in stimulating selective cone cells, the discovery of a new colour was \"open to argument\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbur, who was not involved in the experiment that identified olo, has said the perceived brightness of a colour may change depending on changes to cone sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a share of the economy, it reached 30 per cent after slipping to 27.8 per cent during the depths of the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe federal government is by far the biggest tax collector, bringing in $649 billion, an increase of 5.1 per cent.\n\nBut most states lifted their tax collections by far more. Victoria had the biggest increase, by a substantial 14.2 per cent, followed by NSW (11.8 per cent), South Australia (11.3 per cent) and Queensland (10 per cent).\n\nOn a per capita basis, federal taxation collections lifted by 2.6 per cent to $24,097 per person. This includes personal, company, superannuation and fringe benefits taxes.\n\nThe Victorian government lifted its tax hit per person by a nation-leading 9.5 per cent to a record $6348. In NSW, it grew by 8.8 per cent to $6016 while in Queensland, it increased by 6.6 per cent to $5051.\n\nDefying the trend was the ACT government where tax per person actually fell by one per cent to $5551.",

The Tigers players were scattered across the field, with nobody looking or talking to each other.\n\nBut Moses\u2019 defining moment came in the 54th minute, when Tigers winger Sunia Turuva and Eels forward Luca Moretti were binned for their part in a melee that had spilled over the sideline at CommBank Stadium.\n\nHe finished with four try assists, including the kick for Simonsson, and a cutout ball for Josh Addo-Carr\u2019s first four-pointer.\n\nMoses returned from a foot injury to play his first game of the season, and was sensational in the 38-22 win over the Wests Tigers on Easter Monday.\n\nJones said of Moses\u2019 leadership at that crucial stage of the game: \u201cIt was going to be [interesting] how both teams responded to what had just happened \u2026 which team could get their focus the quickest. And that was Parramatta under Mitch. He gave them the drive and direction.\n\n\u201cMitch\u2019s ability to get the players together and work together, they kept fighting for each other.\n\n\u201cWith Mitchell coming back, you could also see the quality of Rylsey\u2019s coaching coming through. You need someone on the field who coaches and runs the team how you want them to be coached, and Mitchell does that. If you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d\n\nFive-eighth Dylan Brown was arguably the biggest winner from Moses return, and relished being able to return to his running game rather than steer the team around the park. Seeing Brown run for more than 160m and relishing the freedom, however, must have Newcastle scratching their head when you consider they paid him $13m over the next ten years to run the show like Moses.\n\nJones said of Brown: \u201cHe ran the ball more, he was noticed because he was such a great runner of the ball, and people tried to make him into something he\u2019s not.

        "text": "It has just gone midday and the warm and genial commentator orders a large cappuccino. When pressed again about his ability, or inability, to retain quiz-winning volumes of general knowledge, he has a logical explanation: race callers, he says, train their brains to forget. \u201cWe are learning and sieving, learning and sieving, learning and sieving,\u201d he says. Hill says that he can memorise a field of 15 horses in under five minutes, call them in a race and then forget them three minutes later. \u201cI don\u2019t retain stuff, I don\u2019t recall stuff,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI listen to the news a lot. I like listening to the news, and I will forget two days later what was in the news.\u201d\n\nHill chose this cafe because it is central to his story. Hill was eight when his father, Trevor, left the family. His brother, Timothy, was six. For the rest of their schooling life they were raised by their single mum, Susan, in her Altona Meadows house, which is just around the corner from Little Rosebery. Hill now lives in his mother\u2019s home, having agreed to buy his brother out when Susan died in August last year. Matt Hill in his favourite local haunt. Credit: PENNY STEPHENS \u201cShe worked so hard to own that home, you know,\u201d Hill says of his emotional attachment to the family house.\n\n\u201cThis area has been my whole life. I played basketball as a kid up the road, and we are literally 20 metres from where I caught the school bus for six years [to St Paul\u2019s College in North Altona].\u201d Hill\u2019s career is intrinsically linked to his mother. As a 15-year-old, she would drive him across the state to pursue his passion \u2013 calling races at Sale, Shepparton, Stawell and even as far afield as Mildura on Melbourne Cup Day. Matt Hill has called eight Melbourne Cups. Credit: Michael Rayner \u201cHer little yellow Toyota probably did about 400,000 clicks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d get on the phone and ring race clubs, and I\u2019d say, \u2018Would you like a race caller for your non-TAB meeting?\u2019 They\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, can you get here?\u2019, and Mum would drive me. \u201cThen what would happen is my grandfather, who loved racing, and so did my grandmother, they would come along, too. So it ended up being a family expedition.\u201d\n\nDespite his tender age and experience, Hill was always welcomed on course, especially at picnic race meetings where they had often relied on untrained members of the public to call their races. During one meeting at Pooncarie in NSW, the publican had a go and was so bad he was booed off the stand. The next year they agreed to give 16-year-old Hill a chance. When he wasn\u2019t crisscrossing the state, teenage Hill and his family would head to Flemington or Moonee Valley. There, he would find a spare seat or hunt out an empty broadcasting box in the grandstand, and call the races on his own. \u201cI should have been out chasing girls or with my mates, but I was honing what I was doing, you know, calling into a tape recorder,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my life, and I loved it. I would never have changed it, you know. I couldn\u2019t wait to get to Flemington and practise calling.\u201d\n\nHill says his mother never passed judgment on his work unless he mentioned it first. Loading \u201cThere\u2019d be times when I\u2019d come home, it might have been the Cox Plate or a big name, and I\u2019d say, \u2018Mum, I stumbled over a name there\u2019, or something, and she\u2019d go, \u2018Oh yeah, I noticed that.\u2019 \u201cShe would listen to everything. Even in her days in the nursing home, she was listening to me call the football on the radio. Half the time, it was a good way of knowing where I was.\u201d Hill still speaks to his father, who lives in Queensland, but says they are not close.\n\n\u201cMum worked at the National Bank, she was a PA, and then Dad was an engineer,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there\u2019s really no radio broadcasting, not even a racing background. I am self-made in a way.\u201d Hill, 44, says he comes to Little Rosebery three days a week. He spreads the newspaper across its wooden tables, studies the formguide and usually opts for something simple, like Vegemite on toast or a BLT, which the cafe has added to its menu especially for its regular guest. But today he is going to venture into uncharted waters. \u201cI\u2019m gonna hedge my bets,\u201d he says in his signature mellifluous tone. \u201cGonna have a smashed avo, and get some bacon on the side.\u201d\n\nI opt for one of their bestsellers \u2013 Thai chilli eggs. Hill is still working through his coffee, but I order a large glass of pear and apple juice to accompany my meal. Hill lives on his own, with his dog, and describes his profession as \u201cthe love of my life\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very cliche to say I am married to the job, but I am because it is my hobby as well. It really is,\u201d he says. \u201cI sort of live to work. I just love it.\u201d The multi-talented sport commentator is lucky to be alive. After he finished year 12, he started running errands at a Melbourne radio station, won a racing industry scholarship at 19 and became Sydney\u2019s main race caller. But it was on assignment in Beijing, calling at the 2008 Olympics for the Macquarie Radio Network, that he fell seriously ill. He was flattened by double pneumonia and his body started shutting down. There were fears he wouldn\u2019t survive.\n\nHill was flown to Hong Kong, where a medical professor, who had worked through the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, \u201cslammed\u201d him with a concoction of antibiotics. It was later discovered he had melioidosis, a bacterial disease spread through soil, air and water that had a 90 per cent death rate. \u201cIt is actually very similar to COVID,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI just happened to be unlucky \u2013 lucky and unlucky at the same time because to be brutally honest, if I were a smoker, if I had an unhealthy lifestyle, I wouldn\u2019t be here. I was young enough to fight it.\u201d Rather than slow him down, the near-death experience pushed Hill to work harder. \u201cAll I ever wanted to do was call at the Olympics,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it just made me so determined after that. It just made me want it more. It made me want to almost kind of prove myself, actually. Like, I felt like I just needed to prove myself again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why ... I saw the illness almost as a weakness, which was a silly thing to do because anyone can get sick, but I wanted to achieve even more then. \u201cSo, in a way you do realise, and I realise it now with the death of my mum some 16 years later, that we are not here for a long time.\u201d Hill called the Olympic rowing for Nine in Paris, as well as the athletics for Nine radio. But he is about to make a bigger splash in AFL. Fox Footy\u2019s Thursday night AFL callers Matt Hill (left) and Mark Howard. This year he is locked in to call 45 games for Fox Footy, alongside Mark Howard on Thursday nights and Dwayne Russell on Sundays, as well as 25 games for SEN radio on Friday nights.\n\nHe will also cover Melbourne\u2019s major race meetings every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. \u201cThis year is going to be the hardest year I\u2019ve ever worked,\u201d he says. \u201cMy biggest challenge, I\u2019ve found, is I naturally have a quick, quick flow because of calling horse races. So I don\u2019t want to sound like it\u2019s a race caller at the football \u2013 that\u2019s my challenge. \u201cBut it is a fast game. You know, you can be saying something, and the ball might go through four pairs of hands. I try and say as many players\u2019 names as I can, and I try to be as accurate as I can.\u201d Hill, who grew up watching and supporting the Western Bulldogs, says it is difficult to pick up footballers\u2019 numbers during a game, so he concentrates on their faces. Or their unique markings. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty old-fashioned approach in that I get Google Images up, and I just look at their faces as if I\u2019m meeting them for the first time,\u201d he says of his AFL preparation.\n\n\u201cYou just put a name to the face. Then I\u2019ll watch their game from the week before, so I\u2019ll study both of the teams from the week before. \u201cAnd then for me, the most important, this is where the race caller comes out in me. I don\u2019t know how many people do this, I have to be there an hour before the game because I want to see them physically in the flesh when they\u2019re warming up. The receipt for our lunch at Little Rosebery cafe. \u201cThen what I tend to do is look for their coloured boots, anything that\u2019s different \u2013 coloured boots, tattoos, strapping is important. \u201cIf there are a couple of players that look the same, and it might be something really simple, like, you know, a little tatt on the left knee or left shin, or just something that \u2013 if the ball\u2019s being given to a player quickly \u2013 I can pick up on who it is quickly.\u201d\n\nOur discussion returns to Hill\u2019s mother and his first Melbourne Cup call without her. \u201cTwo days after Mum died, my brother and I were driving to Tobin Brothers, to the funeral home, and Tim said to me, \u2018What do you reckon Mum would like played at her funeral?\u2019\u201d Hill says. \u201cHe said, \u2018She loved Life Is a Rollercoaster, by Ronan Keating\u2019. Within seconds, it came on the radio. So that was a bit sort of, \u2018Wow, she\u2019s still here.\u2019 \u201cThen on the day of her funeral, the week later, it was announced in the paper that Ronan Keating would sing on Melbourne Cup Day. He sang 30 minutes before the Melbourne Cup. \u201cSo I took that as a little bit of a \u2018she\u2019s still with me\u2019. And, thank Christ, he didn\u2019t sing Life Is a Rollercoaster before the Cup because that would have made me a wreck.\u201d",

Source: Sylwia and Marcus Logan/The Logans Down Under\n\nTwo families camping in a \u201clittle\u201d Aussie town over the Easter long weekend got quite a fright on Saturday when they awoke to find that a much less fluffy animal had decided to pay them a visit this year.\n\nAfter heading off in their caravan to enjoy the school holidays, Sylwia and Marcus Logan, and their two young children, decided to stop off in Williamstown, about an hour northeast of Adelaide, before making their way back home to Melbourne.\n\nThe family, who documents their travels online, was joined by another who had set up a trailer and tent nearby. However, neither expected the next visitor that rocked up.\n\n\u201cI was doing the dishes and my daughter yelled \u2018snake, snake!\u2019,\u201d Sylwia told Yahoo News Australia on Monday, referring to her six-year-old Maia. \u201cIt was less than a metre away. It was literally right next to her.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI was so proud of her. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s seen a snake in real life and she did the right thing.\u201d\n\nMaia later told Sylwia she initially thought the animal was a stick until she saw its \u201ccute\u201d face. The owner of the tent immediately started to \u201cmove things around\u201d to prevent the red-bellied black snake from entering, but it didn\u2019t deter it at all.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing we could do to stop it,\u201d the mum said. \u201cI always thought that snakes, as long as you make noise and you move around, they keep away.\u201d\n\nWithout hesitation the creature made a beeline for the tent and slipped inside.\n\n\u201cThe thing that was kind of odd is the fact that we were all standing around, and it just cruised under the car, straight to the tent, just between us all. It didn\u2019t seem to care at all,\u201d Marcus explained. Concerned, the group contacted a local snake catcher who was then captured on video removing the determined animal.\n\nSnakes out and about over Easter holidays, catcher warns\n\nIn the footage, the licensed expert can be seen walking up to the tent as the campers direct him \u201cstraight inside\u201d. After he emerges moments later holding the red-belly\u2019s tail, the group of young children that had gathered to watch gasped in awe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty,\u201d Maia exclaims as a woman in the background asks if the creature is \u201ca baby\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a baby but not as big as they can get \u2014 still a mature adult,\u201d the catcher responds, adding that it is a \u201clittle late in the season\u201d for snakes to be roaming around.\n\n\u201cIt should be cooling off by now so with the lingering warm weather, they\u2019re still out and about,\u201d he tells the crowd, assuring them it was likely the only snake in the area as this time of year they\u2019re typically \u201csolo\u201d.\n\nThe deadly snake was relocated further up the road. Source: Sylwia and Marcus Logan/The Logans Down Under\n\nHowever, he did admit that last week and the Easter holidays had been \u201csurprisingly busy\u201d.\n\nAs the temperature climbed over 30 degrees on Wednesday, tradies on a construction site just north of Adelaide\u2019s CBD were stopped in their tracks by two eastern brown snakes tightly coiled around one another. Workers initially thought the pair were mating but quickly realised it was actually an incredible fight for dominance just before they retreat to hibernate over the winter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCouple relieved young daughter spotted deadly snake\n\nSylwia and Marcus said they were relieved Maia had spotted the red-belly so she could alert everyone.\n\n\u201cImagine if no one noticed and then someone went into the tent,\u201d the mum told Yahoo, admitting it \u201cfreaks her out\u201d to think about the number of times a deadly creature has been in their presence without them knowing.\n\nGiven the variety of iconic wildlife in Australia, and their love of adventure, the couple said all they can do is educate their children.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Don\u2019t be paranoid. Don\u2019t harm the snake, keep your distance and respect the nature around you,\u201d Sylwia said, noting the close encounter brought up a \u201cfew important lessons\u201d people should keep in mind when travelling \u2014 always keep your tent zipped, double check first aid kits for snake bite supplies, and undergo a first aid course.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
