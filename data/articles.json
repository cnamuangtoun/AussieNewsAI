(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (AP)\n\nBillions of dollars in Australian exports from beef and sheep to pharmaceuticals and the media may be on the receiving end of American punishment, if an updated list of US trade grievances is anything to go by.\n\nBut there is increasing speculation Trump may ditch his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" \u2013 matching dollar for dollar any fees charged by foreign countries on what they import from the US \u2013 in favour of blanket imposts.\n\nThe Washington Post reported White House aides had drafted a proposal to impose tariffs of about 20 per cent on most imports to the US.\n\nGeorge Washington University Assistant Professor of Economics Steven Hamilton said he expected the Trump administration to go down that much less complicated and more economically devastating route.\n\nHe predicted the direct impact of that approach Down Under would be maybe ten times that felt from the aluminium and steel tariffs imposed earlier this year but still \"not huge\".\n\n\"I'm not actually that worried about the direct effect of the tariffs on Australia. It's quite small,\" he said.\n\nGeorge Washington University assistant professor of economics Steven Hamilton. (Supplied)\n\n\"The thing that we worry about is \u2026 the broader fallout across the world, which, you know, if a lot of countries do retaliate there'll just be a chilling of global trade right?\n\n\"And that's very bad for Australia. When we're a country, a small country that imports a lot of things.\"\n\nIn the shorter term, it \"wouldn't be insane\" to suggest a significant trade shock would trigger a US recession, in turn triggering a global recession.\n\nThe US is Australia's fourth biggest trading partner. Last financial year it imported $37.5 billion in goods and services, led by business services, Intellectual property charges, beef, gold and pharmaceutical products, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .\n\nBeef is one of Australia's biggest exports to the US. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nThat figure is dwarfed by the $212.7 billion sent to China, leading Hamilton to suggest the flow-on effects on global trade and any shrinking of the Chinese economy would hit Australia much harder than the initial charges.\n\nTariffs are taxes charged on businesses importing goods, not on countries themselves, and the price increases are usually passed on to the consumer. Economists say they can be used to increase tax revenue or protect local industries \u2013 but not both at the same time \u2013 and generally lead to worse economic conditions.\n\nThat's why Hamilton expects the tariffs will drive up prices for US consumers on all imported goods \u2013 and local goods too thanks to increased demand \u2013 while shrinking US wages.\n\nThe potential upheaval comes at a critical time for Australia as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton criss-cross the country to convince voters their the safest pair of hands to guide the country through the uncertainty.\n\nThey threw it all behind Trump - and lost more than $300 billion View Gallery\n\nWhile tariffs and Trump more generally have loomed large over the campaign so far, and Labor, has sought to tie Dutton to Trump, both leaders have taken a relatively softly-softly approach.\n\nWhen the updated Office of the US Trade Representative Foreign Trade Barriers report was released this week highlighting complaints about biosecurity, the PBS and the news media bargaining code, Albanese immediately took them off the table in any potential tariff negotiations.\n\nAustralia doesn't impose any tariffs on US imports but the report took issue with Australian restrictions on US beef, pork, chicken, apples and pears designed to keep out disease and a proposal to impose Australian content quotas on streaming services, among others.\n\nHamilton warned responding in kind with retaliatory measures would only harm Australia.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is expected to announce his biggest tariffs to date on April 2. (Bloomberg)\n\n\"It doesn't matter what we do. It doesn't matter what we say. It doesn't matter what we offer,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the end goal is to make America kind of fully self-sufficient.\n\n\"And there's only one way to do that, yeah, and, and the cost of that is that Americans will be poorer, and there's no real, you know, alternative.\"\n\nTrump and his advisers have contradicted themselves over the past days and weeks as they have tried to set expectations about what would be announced.\n\nEverything from reciprocal tariffs on all countries, the enactment of delayed 25 per cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and tariffs on lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals and microchips have been proposed. Trump has already announced auto tariffs that are set to go into effect on April 3.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Life sentence for son who killed mum and tried to claim insurance money\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during a press briefing in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025, in Washington.

        "text": "Have you ever felt like your body odour changes from one day to the next?\n\nIt can be a little gross, but sweating is completely normal, as is a little variation from time to time in the quantity and scent.\n\nHere's what experts have to say about the relationship between body odour, sweat glands and hormones.\n\nDifferent types of sweat\n\nDeshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist and associate professor with the University of New South Wales, says there are \"different types\" of sweat glands.\n\nEccrine sweat glands are distributed over the entire body, for example, on the forehead, where Dr Sebaratnam says sweat is less likely to encounter the bacteria that makes it smelly.\n\nABC Lifestyle Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nHowever, apocrine sweat glands are found in places such as our armpits and groin, where there are hair follicles.\n\nDeshan Sebaratnam is a dermatologist working at Liverpool Hospital in Sydney. (Supplied: Deshan Sebaratnam)\n\n\"They don't just release water and salts and things like that, they also release other chemicals, [and] these chemicals then get broken down by bacteria,\" Dr Sebaratnam says.\n\nThose bacteria dying contributes to bromhidrosis, a medical term for excessive or unpleasant body odour.\n\nDr Sebaratnam says where the sweat is coming from can make a difference.\n\n\"There are other variations like how much you're sweating, how easily it's wicked away, the environment, and maybe your own perception or awareness.\"\n\nWhat role can hormones play?\n\nPav Nanayakkara, a gynaecologist at Jean Hailes for Women's Health, says hormones help to regulate lots of different bodily functions.\n\n\"One of them is temperature and there can be lots of different hormones that help regulate this,\" she says.\n\n\"During various phases of a woman's reproductive life \u2026 there's big shifts in hormones, but even within the [menstrual] cycle itself there can be some shifts.\"\n\nPav Nanayakkara says hormones help with thermoregule our bodies. (Supplied: Jean Hailes for Women\u2019s Health)\n\nFor example, after ovulation a woman's oestrogen levels start to fall and progesterone levels can increase. Dr Nanayakkara says patients can feel hotter and produce more sweat as a result.\n\nDr Nanayakkara also says falling oestrogen levels and higher amounts of androgens such as progesterone and testosterone, which occurs after ovulation and also around menopause, can \"change the composition of sweat, but also make it more appealing to bacteria\".\n\nThis can mean your body is producing \"certain thicker compositions of sweat that bacteria like more, and then you get more odour associated with that\".\n\n\"All of the odour that comes from sweat is from bacteria,\" Dr Nanayakkara says.\n\nWhat's an ordinary amount of sweat variation?\n\n\"Some people don't sweat at all, other people sweat a lot,\" Dr Sebaratnam says.\n\nHe says hyperhidrosis is a condition that may apply to those of us who sweat excessively. The condition can impact particular parts of the body, such as the face and head.\n\nIt some instances, a change in the amount or odour of sweat could indicate a more serious condition, Dr Sebaratnam says.\n\n\"If all of a sudden you notice a change in the quality of your sweating, then that's something that should prompt you to see a doctor [or dermatologist about].\"\n\nDr Nanayakkara says fluctuations, such as those through a monthly menstrual cycle, are normal.\n\nBut she says if sweat \"suddenly starts to become persistently odorous, one of the things [for women] to be thinking about is, you know, are my oestrogen levels falling is, could this be a sign of menopause?\n\n\"Obviously it depends on what age the patient is, but you might be starting to look for other symptoms.\n\n\"Any change that's persistent may warrant further investigation.\"\n\nHow to manage smelly sweat\n\nIf you want to manage your body odour, Dr Nanayakkara suggests starting with non-invasive methods such as deodorant and tweaking your diet and exercise routine.\n\n\"We know that things like spicy foods and red meats can increase body odour, whereas things like fruit and vegetables tend to reduce odour.\"\n\nEverything you need to know about 'natural' deodorants Photo shows A person holding a white roll-on deodorant in their hand. The background has yellow and pink flowers with green leaves. There's a difference between deodorant and antiperspirant, for starters.\n\nShe adds that exercise may also \"help balance hormones\".\n\nFor managing the odour itself, she recommends \"gentle soaps and cleansers for higher-risk areas like armpits and groin areas.\"\n\nDr Sebaratnam says \"over-the-counter, aluminium-based antiperspirants\" can help. He recommends applying it at night, after a shower when you're relaxed and not sweating.\n\nDeodorant that can help \"mask\" body odour and over-the-counter skin products with benzoyl peroxide can help clear the \"bacterial load\" that causes sweat to smell.\n\nThere are also treatment options, such as medications and Botox, for those who experience excessive sweating, he says.\n\nBut, for most of us, sweating is completely normal, even if it occasionally makes us a little more smelly.\n\nThis is general information only. For personal advice, you should see a qualified medical practitioner.",

        "text": "Elite Australian rules football is older than it ever has been before. Not just in the sense that the game is now 160 years old, more so the people that are playing it at the top level.\n\nThis week, Collingwood is set to name the team with the oldest average age since the first bounce of the VFL footy 128 years ago.\n\nLed by 406-game veteran Scott Pendlebury, the Pies remain thick in premiership contention despite the years on the ledger. Even if Collingwood doesn\u2019t break the record this week, it is due to take the mantle at some point this season.\n\nAnd the team that Collingwood will take the record from isn't from footy's distant past, but from Geelong\u2019s 2022 grand final team.\n\nIn fact, the ten oldest teams in VFL/AFL history have hit the field since the 2020 season.\n\nAt the same time footy's youth \u2014 and their future promise \u2014 has never been brighter.\n\nThe start to the 2025 season has seen the game's youngest players impact proceedings more intensely than any time in the last decade.\n\nJust last week Essendon legend Tim Watson declared: \"I think right now we've got the greatest array of young talent bubbling up that we've ever had in the game and that we've ever seen.\"\n\nThis year's draft class was feted as one of the finest in the 30-plus year history of the draft. It's early days, but the youngsters given an opportunity so far have performed to that billing.\n\nThis dichotomy between young and old has spread in recent years. Young players getting an ever-increasing share of the attention from media and fans. But players continue to play longer, more productive careers than ever before.\n\nSo in the battle of footy ages, who wins?\n\nTeenage riot\n\nLet's look at that impactful 2024 AFL draft crop for a second.\n\nEarly in the season outstanding performances have introduced this year's draft crop to a wider AFL crowd. Murphy Reid has wowed onlookers out west, while the draft's top pick, Sam Lalor, has been largely as advertised for Richmond. All across the country the young talent has shown flashes of future promise, if not more.\n\nBut not a lot of those first year players have hit the park yet \u2014 just 16 so far.\n\nFremantle rookie Murphy Reid, who went 17th overall in last year's draft, has enjoyed an excellent start to his AFL career. (Getty Images: Daniel Pockett)\n\nAll up, 67 players in their first eligible draft year (turning 18-years-old in 2024) were selected in the national draft last year. They were joined by eight more 18-year-olds in the rookie draft and six more academy nominated rookies. That group of 81 players makes up about 10 per cent of the league.\n\nThat's in line with the number of youngsters that usually make AFL lists in any given year. But just because you are on an AFL list doesn't mean you'll play AFL games. After all, 42 players sit on AFL lists (excluding category B rookies), and only 23 suit up to play.\n\nAs a result someone needs to miss every week. More often than not, that's the kids.\n\nMost young players struggle when they come into the league. Many are fresh off high school, and some are still finishing their studies.\n\nMost are still physically developing and even grow taller in the years that follow their drafting. Compared with professional athletes that have been dedicated to the craft for years, it\u2019s often a long journey for even the highest credentialed young players.\n\nTake former number one draft pick Jack Watts. When Melbourne picked Watts at the top of the 2008 draft, the teenager was seen as the potential saviour for the long- suffering club. The weight of expectation from the club, its fans and the media was huge.\n\nJack Watts struggled under the weight of expectation after being selected first overall by Melbourne in the 2008 draft. (Getty Images: Hamish Blair, file photo)\n\n\"Anything I did really well was expected \u2014 that's what you're meant to do. Because if I played my best game of footy as an 18-year-old and that's the standard, that's what you should do every week,\" Watts told former teammate Russell Robertson on his podcast last year.\n\n\"Then when you're not quite living up (to expectations) ... that was the hardest thing for me I found.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAnother number one pick echoed that sentiment, but with a twist. For Giants star Aaron Cadman, the biggest pressure wasn't external media focus but his own standards.\n\n\"It's more pressure \u2014 I put pressure on myself. The first preseason we'd do these contested marking drills and I'd be getting like flogged,\" he told the GWS podcast The Green Room last year.\n\n\"I'd walk off the track (thinking), 'oh mate what are you doing? You're pick one, you've got to do this, you're better than this, you're better than that', and then there's a rush to be the best.\"\n\nAaron Cadman was taken by the GWS Giants with the first overall pick in the 2022 draft. (AAP: Morgan Hancock)\n\nIf that's the pressure felt to perform placed on the kids most likely to succeed, imagine that on those on the fringes, at a club far from their home town.\n\nClubs are more willing to account for this development time than ever. Clubs also seemingly are willing to sit players until they are ready, particularly in key positions around the ground.\n\nThere is some truth in the conventional wisdom that key position players take more time to develop. The tallest players do start slower and take longer to hit their peak, though often also sustain their performance for longer into their 30s.\n\nBy contrast, smaller players are often able to more readily contribute right away.\n\nThis also holds for the number of games played in each role. Just two 19-year-old specialist rucks have played a game since 2019.\n\nAccounting for development seems to be more factored in list management decisions as well. In what is considered a cut-throat industry leeway tends to be given to the side of youth.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of late bloomers and developmental stars that give sides hope that their draft crop just needs a year or two to really thrive.\n\nIn the meantime someone needs to play \u2014 and win \u2014 those games.\n\nHelping the aged\n\nRemember that bit about the AFL getting older than ever before? There's a fair bit of evidence to back that up.\n\nJust 12 years ago, players aged 32 or older made up less than one per cent of all AFL player point contributions across the league.\n\nLast year, that number had increased almost tenfold. At the same time the contribution of young players has dipped significantly.\n\nThe success of an increasing number of older players and older teams \u2014 along with advances in training and sports science \u2014 have led to more teams rolling the dice with over 30s players.\n\nPrevious peaks in average player age have coincided with major events, such as the ending of wars or the introduction of fuller professionalism in the sport.\n\nThis current drive instead seems to be coming from elsewhere.\n\nPlayers like Pendlebury have focused on their preparation for the season \u2014 and recovery during it \u2014 to help drive their careers forward.\n\n\"I think all the recovery stuff's cool \u2014 like sauna, ice bath \u2026 heaps of people always ask, 'does that work?', (but) I think the best thing is sleep. So I always prioritise sleep, making sure I get to bed (at a) similar time, every day wake up the same time,\" Pendlebury told Collingwood media last year.\n\n\"I'll go today now and do some sauna into ice bath. So maybe three little rotations, 15 (to) 20 (minutes) in the sauna, three or four minutes in the ice bath ... I've been doing it for 20 years and they don't get easier \u2014 I feel like they actually get colder.\"\n\nCollingwood veterans Scott Pendlebury and Steele Sidebottom set the record for most games played as teammates earlier this season. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nCompared with the part time players of old \u2014 and sometimes questionable preparation habits \u2014 the modern approach may be helping to stretch careers out.\n\nBut this drive might be more about recognising that traditional ideas around the declines of players might be off base.\n\nInstead of jettisoning an aging player at their first slump, teams seem more willing to evaluate on full merits.\n\nRegardless of the exact blend of reasons, Collingwood is set to break a record for aging, and the young talent this year is off to set records of their own.\n\nSo it might be true \u2014 footy might be getting older, but youth is brighter than ever.",

        "text": "Khaled Sabsabi, the Lebanese-Australian artist dumped as Australia's representative at the 2026 Venice Biennale, has spoken publicly for the first time since Creative Australia withdrew his highly prized commission.\n\nIn an interview with ABC Radio National's The Art Show, Sabsabi described the impact of the Commonwealth arts funding body's February decision as \"devastating\".\n\nHe says two artworks that triggered Creative Australia's decision \u2014 raised first in the media and later in parliament \u2014 have been \"grossly misrepresented\".\n\n\"I am an artist, I am a storyteller. [The power of art] lies within the possibility of creating conversations and platforms, even if we as a society find those conversations to be difficult.\n\n\"But regardless, as a cohesive society, we need to have these conversations.\"\n\nListen to the podcast Photo shows The Art Show Visual artists tell you why and how they create! From studio visits, intimate interviews, and live issues, we take art out of the gallery and into your ears.\n\nSabsabi says he was both pleasantly surprised and shocked by the decision to award the Venice contract to him and curator Michael Dagostino, a longtime collaborator, after missing out on three previous occasions.\n\n\"There was a sense of joy, an extreme sense of joy, disbelief, shock, to be accepted in that context \u2014 as a migrant \u2026 as a Muslim.\n\n\"It spoke to all the good things of what Australia stands for, and the values that we stand for, and to have that taken away from you is heartbreaking,\" he says.\n\nSabsabi was 11 when his family emigrated to Australia from war-torn Lebanon in 1977.\n\nHe grew up in Western Sydney, as did Dagostino, with whom Sabsabi formed what's known as \"the artistic team\" for the next instalment of the Venice Biennale in 2026.\n\n\"It [was] extraordinary, not just for me but my family, my community,\" Sabsabi says.\n\n\"I'm not unique. Australia is built on multiculturalism and the idea of a very diverse society. So it was quite a validating acknowledgement for myself, and also for Michael as well.\"\n\nSabsabi began his career as a hip-hop performer before becoming a multidisciplinary artist. (ABC News: Teresa Tan)\n\n'Weaponised' artwork\n\nSabsabi says his artwork has been misread.\n\n\"It's dangerous when artwork becomes politicised and weaponised.\n\n\"Every faith has the right to exist and coexist. Our [Venice Biennale] proposal was about existence and coexistence. I don't understand, I really don't understand [the criticism of older artworks]. Actually I find it quite disgusting, to be honest with you,\" Sabsabi says.\n\nKhaled Sabsabi exhibition indefinitely postponed Photo shows A man standing in front of a blue painting smiles gently Monash University has pulled a show featuring the work of the Lebanese Australian artist.\n\nDays after Sabsabi's appointment was announced, the decision was questioned in a business column in The Australian newspaper, which identified two works by Sabsabi \u2014 an 18-second video called Thank You Very Much from 2006; and the 2007 video work YOU, now in the collection of Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nThank You Very Much includes footage of the hijacked second plane crashing into New York's Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.\n\nThe footage is coupled with vision of then US President George W Bush thanking first responders in the days immediately following the attacks, before he launched the war on terror in retaliation.\n\nYOU, a multi-channel video and sound installation first exhibited in 2007, features Hassan Nasrallah, the former leader of the Lebanese political party and militant group Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli air-strike in 2024.\n\nHezbollah was not listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the Australian government until 2021.\n\nThe day after the column appeared in The Australian, the federal opposition's arts spokesperson, Claire Chandler, raised Sabsabi's appointment during Question Time in the Senate.\n\nSenator Chandler accused Labor of using taxpayer funds to showcase an artist who had \"repeatedly depicted terrorists and terrorist acts\".\n\nSenator Chandler directed her question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Upper House, Senator Penny Wong.\n\n\"With such appalling anti-Semitism in our country, why is the Albanese government allowing a person who highlights a terrorist leader in his artwork to represent Australia on the international stage at the Venice Biennale?\", she asked.\n\nIn a supplementary question, she accused Sabsabi of \"promoting Osama bin Laden\".\n\n\"Will the Albanese government immediately reverse the decision for Mr Sabsabi to represent Australia at the Venice Biennale?\" Senator Chandler said.\n\nArtworks 'misrepresented'\n\nSabsabi strongly rejects the characterisation of him in parliament and the media.\n\n\"Those works have been grossly misrepresented,\" he says.\n\n\"Those works are about the brutality of war and the sensationalism of propaganda, and how propaganda starts with one ideology or idea, and it manifests itself and grows and grows \u2026 to become a distortion. It's important to understand that,\" Sabsabi says.\n\nAccording to his gallerist, Josh Milani, Sabsabi fears the reputational damage caused by Creative Australia's decision to dump him from the Venice Biennale will irrevocably harm his career. (ABC News: Teresa Tan)\n\nHe has expressed concern that these artworks in particular have raised objections nearly two decades after their creation, adding that he is not aware of any complaints from any member of the public when they were first exhibited in 2006 and 2007 or subsequently.\n\nFurthermore, \"this is not the proposal that we put for Venice 2026\", Sabsabi says.\n\nWhy Sabsabi was dumped\n\nSabsabi was selected as Australia's representative to the world's oldest biennial exhibition of contemporary art in December 2024, although the decision was not announced publicly until early February.\n\nThe appointment followed a competitive tender process overseen by Creative Australia, with candidates shortlisted by a panel of local and overseas arts industry advisers.\n\nIt is understood that the panel never met as a group, but made their recommendations individually to Creative Australia, with overseas-based panel members doing so via video conference.\n\nAs the commissioning body, the final decision was made by Creative Australia's CEO, Adrian Collette, and the organisation's former head of visual arts, Mikala Tai.\n\nThe selection process, which differs slightly from that used to determine Australia's last three representative artists, is now the subject of a review called by Creative Australia.\n\nHow the decision to dump Khaled Sabsabi unfolded Photo shows A man standing in front of a blue painting smiles gently Creative Australia's chair warned if he did not act with urgency to dump artist Khaled Sabsabi from representing the nation at the Venice Biennale, the agency would risk being swept away by a \"tidal wave\" of controversy. The controversy came anyway.\n\nA series of events followed Senator Chandler's comments that would prove decisive.\n\nThe Arts Minister, Tony Burke, phoned Adrian Collette, who \u2014 by his own admission \u2014 had already phoned Robert Morgan, the chair of the Board, after being tipped off about Senator Chandler's questions in parliament.\n\nSpeaking on Arts in 30, Mr Burke denied he interfered in Creative Australia's decision-making.\n\nBriefing notes are prepared for the minister in case such matters are raised in Parliament, and he says his phone call related to apparent omissions in the background material provided by Creative Australia.\n\nCollette and Morgan resolved to summon an extraordinary meeting of the board within hours (one board member, Professor Larissa Behrendt, was absent and largely uncontactable while on a trip to Norfolk Island).\n\nThe board met for an hour and a half, and, Collette told Senates estimates, there were \"no dissenting voices\" when voting to rescind the Venice commission publicly awarded to the artistic team of Sabsabi and Dagostino six days earlier.\n\nCreative Australia defended the move in a statement, saying it had acted to maintain social cohesion and to prevent \"a prolonged and divisive debate\" which might erode public support for the arts.\n\nSabsabi was informed that a board meeting had been called, and according to Collette's evidence to a Senate Estimates hearing, was called on to briefly explain the artworks in question.\n\nCollette testified that he later phoned Sabsabi to notify him of the board's decision but that he did not speak to Sabsabi himself, because the artist was too upset to speak.\n\nThe next day, two key players in Australia's Venice participation, Creative Australia's head of visual arts, Mikala Tai, and project manager Tahmina Maskinyar resigned.\n\nThe only visual artist on the board, Lindy Lee, also quit.\n\nIncreasing polarisation\n\nIt pays to consider the highly pressurised environment in which Creative Australia's decision was made.\n\nReported incidents of anti-Semitism have been on the rise since the Hamas incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war on Gaza.\n\nIn the same period, reported incidents of Islamophobia have also spiked.\n\nIslamophobic and anti-Semitic incidents on the rise Photo shows A woman in a black suit and pink shirt with dark hair, is back to back with a man in a black suit and white shirt. Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents in Australia are at unprecedented levels as the Israel-Gaza war rages.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Australia's cultural sector has been riven by the Gaza war, mirroring \u2014 and, at times, exceeding \u2014 the toxicity and polarisation in public discourse.\n\nThe discord has swept across the sector, engulfing the Australian arts community in ways that before October 7 would have been hard to predict.\n\nSo where does that leave Khaled Sabsabi?\n\nSabsabi's gallerist, Josh Milani, of Brisbane's Milani Gallery, says unless the peak body for the arts moves to reinstate the artist, \"his career is finished\", citing the chilling effect of Creative Australia's decision on Melbourne's Monash University Museum of Art (MUMA).\n\nFlat Earth, an exhibition featuring Sabsabi was scheduled to open in June, but has been \"postponed\" indefinitely.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, a Monash University spokesperson said it had \"identified a need for the museum to deepen its collaboration and engagement\" on the exhibition.\n\nThe Monash University spokesperson said that the postponement followed \"consultation with our communities\".\n\nSince the backflip, Creative Australia has been under attack from the community it was constituted by the Albanese government to serve.\n\nIt has been accused by many of betraying the principle of artistic freedom and of yielding to political interference \u2014 at odds with one of its primary functions: to operate at arm's length from government.\n\nIt has also garnered criticism from a broad section of the visual arts community, one of the core stakeholder groups and main beneficiaries of the funds it disburses on behalf of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe board's unprecedented decision to revoke Sabsabi and Dagostino's commission has also exposed the peak arts body to claims that it overreacted to media and political pressure.\n\nAlmost immediately, the artists and curators shortlisted for the Venice Biennale 2026 \u2014 Sabsabi's competition \u2014 unanimously and strongly condemned the decision.\n\nIndustry upheaval over artist dropped from cultural event Photo shows Two man stand on street wearing black suits. One smiles and one has serious expression. Industry resignations and anger have followed the shock decision by Creative Australia to drop artist Khaled Sabsabi from one of the world's most prestigious cultural events.\n\nIn a joint statement, they pre-emptively refused any prospective offer by Creative Australia to accept what they regarded to be a tainted commission.\n\nIt leaves open the very real possibility that the Australia Pavilion will be mothballed in 2026, following Australia's most successful outing ever in 2024.\n\nDespite being targeted by sections of the media for his use of social media, Kamilaroi and Bigambul artist Archie Moore won Australia the coveted Golden Lion for best national participation, with curator Ellie Buttrose.\n\nEvery curator to represent Australia in Venice \u2014 with one exception \u2014 signed an open letter to Creative Australia urging that Sabsabi and Dagostino be reinstated and for transparency over the decision-making processes that led to the sacking of the artistic team.\n\nDesire to 'move beyond'\n\nMilani has published an impact statement detailing the personal harm and reputational damage he says Creative Australia has inflicted on Sabsabi.\n\n\"Their decision had already set in motion the dismantling of his career and livelihood,\" Milani wrote.\n\n\"This indefinite postponement [by MUMA] is a direct result of Creative Australia's complete abandonment of him as an artist and a human being.\n\n\"They have allowed the mischaracterisation of him as a terrorist sympathiser to go unchecked. It should be clear, he is against terrorism and violence in all its forms and he is against racism in all its forms, including anti-Semitism.\n\n\"Creative Australia has not cleared Khaled's name \u2014 the spectre of misinformation about him and his work remains, and continues to dismantle and destroy his reputation, as the decision by Monash University exemplifies.\n\n\"The development also shows Creative Australia's conduct has empowered censorship within the arts sector,\" he wrote.\n\nMilani argues that \"reinstatement is the only way to heal the wound of this decision\" and has urged the board of Creative Australia to \"do the right thing\".\n\nCreative Australia did not respond to The Art Show's most recent request for an interview, but has said previously that it will await the findings of a review into the selection process before commenting, adding, \"There is essential context that must be considered.\"\n\nFor his part, Sabsabi says the episode has profoundly shaken him, personally and professionally, and despite establishing a crowdfunding campaign to mount the exhibition he and Dagostino proposed for Venice, he is genuinely unsure of his future as an artist.\n\n\"I mean, we would like to be reinstated and move beyond this ridiculous situation.\n\n\"There is great uncertainty \u2014 even if this work will materialise. Everything has become so challenging for us. But we hope for the best. I mean, that's all we can do is hope for the best\".",

With the row over whether Tasmania can afford a new stadium a long way from ending, Labor may think it can be a spectator to the melee. But, if Labor votes for the project and it goes badly, it'll be tied to the failure as well.\n\nThe Tasmanian Planning Commission is currently assessing the proposed stadium and released a draft report on Monday which was scathing of the government's claims about the project.\n\nUnder the current POSS process, the commission will prepare a final report to be released in September and then MPs will get to vote on whether to approve the project or reject it.\n\nIn question time today, independent MP Kristie Johnston asked the premier if the government had sought or received advice about ways to move ahead with the stadium outside of the POSS process.\n\nMr Rockliff told parliament he spoke to his department yesterday seeking that advice.\n\nHe said he would consider all options given the significance of the project for the state, flagging the POSS assessment of the stadium may be abandoned.\n\n\"Why wouldn't I? Because we've committed to the process that we're going through now,\" he said.\n\n\" At the end of the day, POSS process or enabling legislation, this parliament will have its say. \"\n\nIt is unclear what form any special legislation to approve the stadium might take, if the POSS process was abandoned.\n\nGreens leader Rosalie Woodruff suggested an approval or permit could be \"rushed through this house in a matter of days\" and urged the premier to reveal what he was planning.\n\nMr Rockliff was unable to answer, telling parliament the advice had not yet come back.\n\n\"What I'm about is ensuring that we get this job done and we get a Tasmanian team in the AFL and AFLW and that's why I've been so committed to this project,\" he said.\n\n\"We will reach in and get this job [done].\"\n\nJeremy Rockliff has doubled down on his support for the stadium.

(Supplied: Unitywater)\n\nA 22-kilometre-long pipeline was constructed to transport Class A treated wastewater from the South Caboolture sewage treatment plant.\n\nIt is pumped to the Moodlu quarry storage facility, then onto farmland north-west of Brisbane.\n\nTwin View Turf's Lawrence Stephenson says the recycled water has changed the way it can farm. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nThe irrigation scheme will divert more than 2.6 gigalitres (2.6 billion litres) of recycled water annually.\n\nPreviously, it was discharged into the Caboolture River, flowing into Pumicestone Passage and Moreton Bay, a nutrient-sensitive environment under increasing pressure from urbanisation.\n\nUnitywater staff have been working on projects to improve the health of the Caboolture River. (Supplied: Unitywater)\n\nUnitywater chief executive Anna Jackson said she didn't want people to get the wrong idea of what was being discharged, \"which is clear, highly treated water\".\n\nBut she said it would divert a nutrient load of 11 tonnes of nitrogen and nearly 2,000 tonnes of phosphorous annually to be used as nutrient-rich irrigation water on farmland.\n\n\"The alternative for us was to build a longer pipe that would have led to an ocean outfall for longer-term population growth,\" Ms Jackson said.\n\nIn Australia, wastewater is usually discharged to waterways or oceans via pipelines.\n\nAnna Jackson says the Wamuran Irrigation Scheme is a \"win-win\" for farmers, ratepayers and the environment.

(ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nIn a recent visit to Singapore, Moreton Bay City Mayor Peter Flannery was impressed by how it reused what is described as \"new water.\"\n\nHe said horticulture played a significant role in Moreton Bay's economy by producing crops, including strawberries, raspberries, pineapples, avocados and turf.\n\nWater a precious resource\n\nJust a small proportion of Australian agricultural irrigation comes from recycled water.\n\nBut Queensland government climate modelling indicates droughts will increase in both frequency and duration by 2059.\n\n\"It's a great use of something that's a natural asset that we usually get rid of,\" Councillor Flannery said.\n\nThe recycled water will be withheld from the pineapples within a month of harvest. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nFor Pinata Farms general manager Gavin Scurr, it provides security to produce pineapples and berries, whatever the weather.\n\n\"We're in a wet period at the moment, but it will be dry again soon, and whenever it's dry, water is always a challenge,\" Mr Scurr said.\n\n\"It limits our production, and it limits our ability to deliver consistent fruit to consumers.\n\n\" And what this scheme does is it underpins the water supply. \"\n\nThe third-generation grower said he had no concerns about the safety of using treated water that was not fit for drinking to irrigate crops for human consumption.\n\nThe recycled water has been cleared for use on fruit crops with strict conditions. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nHe said Pinata Farms had been using a similar recycled water scheme to grow berries for 15 years in Stanthorpe.\n\nThe Southern Downs Regional Council uses Class A recycled water to provide irrigation for horticulture, sports and recreation grounds, the golf course and school sports fields.\n\n\"The water doesn't come in contact with the berry crop at all. It's all put in underneath the plastic,\" Mr Scurr explained.\n\nRecycled water is dispersed under plastic to keep it clear from the strawberries fruits. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\n\"There's a plastic barrier there for weeds and other purposes that protects the fruit from any of this water, so it doesn't come into any contact.\"\n\nWhile pineapples would receive overhead irrigation in their developmental stage, Mr Scurr said they would not be watered within one month of harvest.\n\n\" So it's incredibly safe. In fact, the water is much cleaner than our existing water out of the creek. \"\n\nPinata Farms says it will prioritise using recycled water to leave more water in its dams and creeks. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nMr Scurr said his family would prioritise using the recycled water on crops, allowing farm dams to stay full and overflow into creeks and ecosystems.\n\n\"Other growers downstream from us will now have more water coming down the creek than there would have in the past as well,\" he said.\n\nTwin View Turf was the first farm to use the Wamuran Irrigation Scheme on about 200 hectares.\n\nLawrence Stephenson has welcomed the Wamuran Irrigation Scheme. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nGeneral manager Lawrence Stephenson said they had used nearly 200 megalitres of recycled water since the scheme was commissioned this year.\n\nMr Stephenson said it was a \"complete change in agricultural practices\" from having to \"ration\" water.\n\n\" It now means that we can use as much water as the plant can sustain to maximise our production through all stages of the growing cycle. \"\n\nFive farms will be included in the initial stage of the scheme. The irrigation water is currently subsidised.",

Trillions \u2014 the dollars held by Australian workers in superannuation can make you dizzy.\n\n\"There's $4.2 trillion of members' money under management in superannuation,\" says Mary Delahunty, chief executive of peak body the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA).\n\n'That makes Australia one of the top investors in the world.\"\n\nASFA's new study suggests compulsory super has boosted household savings by more than $500 billion since its inception, and it is reducing the government's need to pay for the age pension \u2014 the main income support for older people.\n\nASFA says we're also spending vastly less than many other countries to give people a better retirement.\n\nAustralia currently spends around 2.3 per cent of our GDP on the aged pension, but that figure is falling (gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all the goods and services created in a year).\n\n\"It'll go down to around 2 per cent by 2060,\" says Ms Delahunty.\n\n\"This is against a backdrop of an aging population with increased health needs.\n\n\" It's bucking the trend internationally. Most OECD countries are [spending] 9 per cent and growing, and they will be above 10 per cent by 2060. \"\n\nMary Delahunty says superannuation has transformed the lives of workers. (ABC News: Simon Tucci)\n\nThe only country spending a smaller portion of GDP on the age pension currently is South Korea (1.3 per cent) but by 2060, that's predicted to be 7.5 per cent.\n\n\"We are the only ones going in the other direction \u2026 and it's the compulsory super system that has delivered that to every taxpayer.\"\n\nAccording to the latest federal budget, in 2024-25 alone, tax concessions on superannuation 'contributions' cost the federal government $29.2 billion in revenue forgone, tax concessions on super 'earnings' cost $22.2 billion in revenue forgone, and other miscellaneous concessions cost $3.8 billion.\n\nBut ASFA says when the cost of those super tax concessions is added to age pension costs, the total cost to government \"is still relatively low and sustainable.\"\n\nIt says the cost of tax concessions for super contributions is projected to remain stable at around 0.9 per cent of GDP, while the cost of concessions for investment earnings is projected to rise from 1 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2062-63.\n\nDo Australia's super tax concessions take from the poor and give to the rich? Photo shows Three piggy banks sit in a row in white, pink and blue on a pink background. Their snouts are of differing shapes. Australia's super tax concessions will cost the government almost $60 billion in 2025-26, which is $9 billion more than expected. How can we afford it?\n\n\"Overall, the total cost of the age pension and tax concessions for superannuation is projected to rise marginally - from 4.2 per cent of GDP to 4.4 per cent of GDP by 2062-63,\" it says.\n\n\"This is remarkable given the expected ageing of Australia's population. This means that the cost of Australia's retirement income system will remain more affordable than almost every other OECD country.\"\n\nSam Sicilia, chief investment officer at super fund HostPlus, said the primary purpose of super is to provide people with \"dignity in retirement\", but noted another intention was to reduce the reliance on the government age pension.\n\n\"What you'll find is, as account balances grow over time, in the future there will be less relying on government pension, and therefore it will reduce the burden on the taxpayer.\"\n\nAnd there is only one size for super: bigger.\n\nFrom July this year, 12 per cent of the value of all the pay packets in Australia will go into the superannuation system annually, locked up until people retire or turn 65 and can access it.\n\nMegamoney as funds look globally to invest\n\nThe amount of money in super is hard to comprehend \u2014 total superannuation assets were $4.1 trillion at the end of the September 2024 quarter, according to ASFA.\n\nCath Bowtell, chair of IFM Investors, puts it simply: \"That's just a lot of money.\"\n\nIFM Investors represents so-called \"industry\", or profit-to-member, funds like AustralianSuper, HESTA and Rest, funds including AMP and Zurich that manage people's accounts for profit, as well as institution-based corporate funds such as Qantas Superannuation Plan and Telstra Super.\n\nIt looks after $230 billion in assets, from a 250-kilometre toll road in Indiana in the US, to container port terminals in Vancouver (Canada) and Adelaide, Perth and Darwin airports.\n\n\"There's $US2 billion ($3.2b) flowing into the [super] system every week that we have to invest.\n\n\"That's just a lot of money that has to be put to work for Australian working people and we have to scour the world, now.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe country's largest fund, AustralianSuper, has more than 40 staff in New York.\n\nLast year, Australian Retirement Trust opened an outpost in London, while Aware Super already had an office in the UK's financial hub.\n\n\"The size of the system [currently] is 1.5 times the size of the Australian economy, growing to two times the size of the Australian economy in the foreseeable future,\" Ms Bowtell notes.\n\nSam Sicilia agrees most Australians wouldn't understand the epic scale our system has grown to.\n\n\"We currently have the fourth-largest pension pool of capital in the world,\" he says, with only the US, the United Kingdom and Canada ahead.\n\n\" The Australian system is mandatory, and it will surpass the UK and Canada within the next five to seven years, so we will end up being the second-largest pool of capital in the world. \"\n\nWe'll have the silver medal for retirement savings, with just approximately 8 per cent of the population of the United States.\n\nBig funds, not even taking into account more than 621,000 self-managed super funds holding more than $1 trillion, currently hold 21 per cent of the shares trading on the Australian stock exchange.\n\nThe funds could easily afford all Australian stocks, but instead spread their risk across different financial instruments and assets like land, office towers and toll roads.\n\nThat scale is raising big questions about our financial system.\n\nSuper's ability to amplify and dampen shocks\n\nIn its recent Financial Stability Review \u2014 a bird's-eye look at the resilience and stability of our financial system \u2014 the Reserve Bank of Australia called out the scale of super.\n\n\" The superannuation sector's significant growth, rising connectedness with banks and increasing footprint in financial markets creates new risks, including the ability to amplify shocks. \"\n\nAs the sector has grown, its connections with the banking system have increased: superannuation funds directly hold nearly one-third of bank short-term debt securities and over one-quarter of equity issued by domestic banks.\n\nAustralian super funds provide a huge amount of the funding for domestic banks. The RBA says that's both a source of stability and a potential risk. (Supplied: ASFA)\n\n\"Consequently, superannuation funds have the potential to amplify shocks in the financial system,\" the report says.\n\nThis could happen if the investment decisions of funds were to become \"more correlated or concentrated in times of generalised market stress\".\n\nThis did happen at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when funds increased their sale of banks' \"debt securities\" back to those same banks, which added to the pressure they were under to find funding. It made finding cash more expensive.\n\nWhat does 'slow motion sell-down' mean for super? Photo shows Blurred numbers on the ASX stock boards The Australian share market is now close to what financial market participants call a \"technical correction\".\n\nBut the flip side is that a key tenet of superannuation is the concept of \"preservation\" of money for retirement.\n\nBecause people can't access their super until they turn 65, even when shocking things happen \u2014 for example, the pandemic \u2014 there isn't a surge of people trying to remove their money from their super accounts, because they're not allowed to.\n\nThat means superannuation funds are still searching for investments when others flee.\n\n\"As long-term investors, superannuation funds can support financial stability by deploying capital in a counter-cyclical manner, including when volatility spikes and asset prices fall,\" the report adds.\n\nBecause super funds are investing for a long horizon and most customers can't pull their money, market dips are an opportunity to buy assets at a cheap rate rather than a disaster that sees customers lining up to withdraw their cash at a loss.\n\nThe sector is also structured in a way that \"help[s] limit the build-up of systemic risks\", including by having variable returns, it notes.\n\nSuper a 'patient provider of capital', industry says\n\nThe super industry, predictably, doesn't see its size as a weakness.\n\nASFA's Ms Delahunty says the \"interconnectedness of super with the banking system and other financial systems around the world\" is something the sector has been watching closely \u2014 and is one of the key reasons funds diversified into investing in different things in different parts of the world.\n\n\"We invest in Australia and increasingly, invest internationally, and we work pretty closely with the central bank on what some of those risks might be,\" she says.\n\n\"On the flip side of that stability is this patient provider of capital that actually can invest counter-cyclically as well. So it is an argument with two sides of a coin, I suppose.\"\n\nHostPlus's Sam Sicilia says Australia's \"four very strong, very stable banks\" served the nation well during the pandemic and added to financial stability. But they weren't alone.\n\n\"The superannuation funds had capital, and now have arguably more capital to provide a backstop in case there is a financial event,\" he told ABC News at the Asia Pacific Financial and Innovation Symposium in Melbourne.\n\n\" We can fund companies, we can fund investments. We could fund banks to help them through liquidity needs in the event of a crisis \u2026 a large pool of capital provides stability to the financial system. \"\n\nSuper funds searching for liquidity\n\nDeutsche Bank macro strategist Lachlan Dynan says the scale of Australian superannuation investments means that, in many ways, they've \"outgrown\" the options here.\n\nLachlan Dynan says super has at times outpaced GDP growth. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\nThat's because \"what they care about is not just returns, but liquidity as well\", meaning that they need to see money coming in from their investments, but they also want the ability to get money out if needed.\n\n\"As they become a bigger chunk of markets, the potential concern is that they want to access more liquidity overseas.\n\n\"Accessing greater and more diverse investment opportunities overseas is probably also partly a motivator of that.\"\n\nHe can understand the Reserve Bank's concern about the impact of super in a potential financial shock.\n\nReplenishing your superannuation if you accessed it early Photo shows A pink piggy bank sits on a pile of Australian money More than 3 million Australians raided their retirement nest egg during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"What the RBA and some others have been focused on is the risk that, in a global shock, the funds could come under pressure from their foreign exchange hedge [investments],\" Mr Dynan says, referring to a situation where funds have to deliver cash to avoid a \"margin call\" or potential losses.\n\n\"There might be a concern that in order to meet that cash, they potentially need to sell some Australian dollar assets.\n\n\"Given they own such large chunks of some key markets, then the chance for kind of an exacerbating force on those markets is there from simply the presence of super in those markets,\" he explains.\n\nThat is tempered, he notes, by a recent example \u2014 when, during the pandemic, people were given \"early access\" to their superannuation.\n\nIt's been estimated that 3 million Australians withdrew around $38 billion from their accounts under the scheme.\n\n'Super for houses' mooted by Coalition in election fight\n\nIf elected, the Coalition says it would write laws that would allow first home buyers to use up to 40 per cent of their superannuation balance towards a home.\n\nThis would help people enter the housing market by allowing them to use up to $50,000.\n\nTo be able to withdraw that amount, they would require a super balance of $125,000 \u2014 most people aged 40 and under don't have half that much, according to the Australian Tax Office.\n\nThe Coalition did not answer questions about the proposal, but said in a statement that using super to buy a house was better than being a lifelong renter:\n\n\"Under a Coalition government, we are recommitting to allow first home buyers to access a portion of their own superannuation to help with the deposit hurdle.\n\n\"This means Australians can buy their first home sooner by slashing the time taken to save a deposit by three years, on average.\n\n\" Reports including the Intergenerational Report show owning your own home historically plays an important role in supporting retirement outcomes for Australians. \"\n\nThe Labor Party was asked to comment on the proposal but did not respond by deadline.\n\nPrevious discussion of the idea \u2014 which was taken to the 2022 election by the Coalition \u2014 has noted that it would increase demand for housing and be likely to boost prices.",

        "text": "Australians are calling for more local government funding for community facilities, tourism and infrastructure maintenance as regional councils say they are financially disadvantaged.\n\nAhead of the federal election, some local governments are calling for more adequate support to provide improved services to their communities.\n\n\"More accommodation is needed in a popular town, and investment in getting small, local businesses and things for the community.\" \u2014 Giulia Delzoppo, Renmark, SA. \"In our rec centre, adding in better sports facilities like fans, air conditioners or scoreboards, because it's really hard to practice or play in there when it's really hot or you can't keep up with the scores.\" \u2014 Elsie Lindner, Renmark, SA. \"As travellers we would love to see more RV friendly towns, because the money we spend when we stop goes back into the community.\" \u2014 Bev and Josh Gardner, Far South Coast, NSW. \"Upkeep of our roads and buildings, and other infrastructure that has fallen behind in the maintenance cycle.\" \u2014 Darcy Biggs, Deniliquin, NSW.\n\nHannah Lindner and her daughter Elsie, 10, in Renmark. (ABC Riverland: Elyse Armanini)\n\nWhere does the money come from?\n\nThe majority of council revenue is obtained through rates and charges, but a large proportion is acquired through Financial Assistance Grants which provide untied funding to use on local issues, projects and key priorities.\n\nIt is made up of two components: general purpose funding, which is distributed between the states and territories on a per-capita basis, and local roads support, distributed according to fixed historical shares.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers' 2025-26 federal budget revealed local governments will receive $3.45 billion, approximately 0.51 per cent of Commonwealth taxation revenue, including a $144 million increase to the assistance grants.\n\nFederal budget winners and losers Find out who is set to benefit and who may miss out in the Albanese government's final budget ahead of an election in May.\n\nIn the Coalition's budget reply, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton did not reveal any specific funding for local government.\n\nSubmissions to the parliamentary inquiry into local government sustainability revealed the distribution of federal funding was not balanced.\n\nThe inquiry heard councils were being increasingly relied on to manage services previously overseen by Commonwealth, state and territory governments, such as health, aged care, childcare and mental health.\n\nOne submission from the Grattan Institute said Financial Assistance Grants favour densely populated states and similar-sized councils in different states received \"vastly different funding outcomes\".\n\nA majority of councils across Australia are considered regional, rural or remote. (Supplied: Dave Hartley Photography)\n\n'Disadvantaged' councils\n\nIn South Australia's Riverland region, Renmark Paringa Council chief executive Tony Siviour said the state was disadvantaged in the allocation of federal funding.\n\nHave Your Say: What matters to you this federal election? Photo shows A graphic showing a range of reader comments about potential issues in Australia's 2025 federal election. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say.\n\nHe noted the neighbouring Wentworth Shire Council in New South Wales, with about 8,000 ratepayers, had received $2 million more in untied funding than his district with approximately 10,000 residents.\n\n\"You can imagine how much good that would do for us in terms of balance in our budget,\" Mr Siviour said.\n\n\"We do get some supplementary funding to acknowledge that, but it doesn't make it up to the amount that we should get as per population.\"\n\nHe said he could not put a dollar figure on what funding the council was seeking, but said an \"adequate amount\" was needed to \"be more sustainable and help cover the costs of council operations\".\n\nTony Siviour says the regional council is struggling financially. (ABC Riverland: Elyse Armanini)\n\nLocal Government Association of South Australia president Heather Holmes-Ross said funding from Commonwealth taxation revenue had almost halved since the mid-1990s.\n\nDr Holmes-Ross said the per capita formula used to determine the funding for each council no longer reflected the needs of certain councils, particularly in the regions.\n\n\"[We need] a formula that's needs-based so the councils servicing areas that don't have the capacity to pay are still able to provide for their communities,\" she said.\n\n\"The work that we're doing at a council level is far greater than it used to be, but the funding increases haven't been equal to that.\n\n\" It's really disappointing when we see the other tiers of government expecting us to do more and then not funding us to do it. \"\n\nShe acknowledged councils had the option to increase rates, but said the cost-of-living crisis made it difficult to implement rate rises.\n\nMid Murray Council Mayor Simone Bailey says smaller regional councils are being left behind by the federal government. (Supplied: Mid Murray Council)\n\nIn the state's Mid Murray region, Mayor Simone Bailey said councils like hers were being \"left behind\" in a \"broken and outdated system\".\n\nShe said federal funding was a \"fundamental issue\" and the equity divide between metropolitan and regional councils in SA was stark.\n\nMs Bailey said wealthier councils were able to charge for services like parking to provide additional revenue, an option less available to regional councils.\n\n\"Our councils here in the regions are only getting about 30 per cent of what the state assesses our needs are,\" she said.\n\n\" If we had the correct funding, we wouldn't have to apply or beg for grants. \"\n\nMannum is one of the main towns within the Mid Murray Council area. (Supplied: Dave Hartley Photography)\n\nInquiry to inform future decisions\n\nFederal Local Government Minister Kristy McBain said funding had increased for the Roads to Recovery initiative, and \"transparent grant programs\" were available for housing, energy and growth opportunities.\n\nShe said the inquiry's findings would inform future funding arrangements.",

Bred to love this sort of trip fresh and is one to keep an eye on. 8. I Am Overs debuted with a close third in a small field at Gosford a couple of weeks ago. Likely improver on that and is in the mix. 2. Gaeilge hasn\u2019t yet lived up to early promise but gave a sight when third at Newcastle behind Buffalo after leading. How to play it: Ohope WIN\n\n1. Engine Room looks a promising type, and he comes through a strong maiden from back in October where he split Snitzanova and Brigidine Gal at Kensington. If he handles the ground he will be a major player. 9. She Rex hasn\u2019t done a lot wrong in her three starts for as many placings at the end of last year. Muswellbrook trial winner a couple of weeks ago and is capable of showing up. 7. Manukau was a shade disappointing on debut but improved with a closing second at Hawkesbury last time out. Still on the up and a wet track might be a plus. 3. Now Is The Hour us on the way up and has been right in the market in his two runs back. Extra trip might suit him now.\n\nHow to play it: Engine Room WIN\n\nRace 3\n\n12.

Placed here on a wet track on debut. 9. California Sunrise hasn\u2019t finished worse than fourth in seven starts and while best is probably at 1400m plus she can run a race fresh. Have to keep her safe. 8. Linwood wasn\u2019t fancied in betting at her only start but swept home to win on a heavy track here back in July.

Dr Evil ran about as well as he could on a dry track coming off a seven-week break at Hawkesbury, running into third.

Arqana was a solid favourite at Flemington a month ago and didn\u2019t really make an impact, staying about midfield all the way. Never won on a good track, so the conditions will suit her this time. 7. Imposing Pier looked the winner when he darted through on the inside at Hawkesbury last time only to be nailed on the line. Consistent type who can be around the mark again. 8. Inferencia is in career-best form and is in line for a hat-trick after leading all the way in a Midway at Rosehill.

Others are more specific to a particular era, like the thrill of getting an obscure record mailed to you from overseas, followed by the bitter discovery it\u2019s warped. This is among the first of many misfortunes to befall Angus (Ed Oxenbould), the hapless hero of Jonathan Ogilvie\u2019s nostalgic teen movie Head South, set in Christchurch at the end of the 1970s. When Angus does get to listen to the debut single from John Lydon\u2019s Public Image Ltd, his world changes, as the film signals by shifting to widescreen. Before long, he\u2019s ditching his shaggy haircut for short back and sides, adding staples to his school uniform and dreaming about starting a band. Ed Ozenbould is a mild-mannered New Zealand sort of punk. Credit:\n\nHe\u2019s a very New Zealand sort of punk, apologising that his hair isn\u2019t all it should be (\u201cI\u2019m trying to get it to stick up more\u201d). He also can\u2019t stop smiling \u2013 partly from anxiety, but also from mingled joy and relief at having found his tribe. As it turns out, everyone on the local scene is a poseur of one sort or another. If anything, the coolest guy in sight is Angus\u2019 morose but kindly dad Gordon (the versatile veteran Marton Csokas), with his tweed suits and a voice that could be used to advertise whisky. Angus himself is a comparably unexpected mix of traits, a gormless innocent who might still have some potential as a stage performer along Ian Curtis lines (Oxenbould, an Australian who became an internationally known child star a decade ago, is an actor to look out for). A New Zealander who has worked a good deal in Australia, Ogilvie has had an odd, mostly under-the-radar career, combining a furtive temperament with a fondness for gimmicks. Such gimmicks aren\u2019t absent here, ranging from visual tricks such as jump cuts and film burn effects to the convoluted metaphor alluded to in the title. Still, this is the film where Ogilvie shows what he really has in him. You don\u2019t have to know he started out in the 1980s directing music videos for Christchurch\u2019s Flying Nun label \u2013 which gets a shout-out here \u2013 to deduce that portions of Angus\u2019 story must be autobiographical.",

        "text": "Hi, over the next five weeks, I\u2019ll be blogging about the seat of Wills as the 2025 federal election unfolds.\n\nI\u2019m normally an investigative reporter for The Age \u2013 investigative reporters never miss an opportunity to push their stories, so please read my most recent reporting on Australia\u2019s $4 billion cosmetic injectables industry here. But during the federal election, I\u2019ll follow full-time Labor MP Peter Khalil, the Greens\u2019 Samantha Ratnam, Liberal Jeff Kidney, Socialist Sue Bolton, and all of the other candidates in this northern suburbs seat.\n\nLabor\u2019s Peter Khalil, Sydney Road, Brunswick, and the Greens\u2019 Samantha Ratnam. Credit: Marija Ercegovac\n\nWills covers progressive northern suburbs like Brunswick and Coburg, and Labor-leaning areas like Pascoe Vale, Fawkner, Oak Park and Glenroy. But a redistribution has added some of Australia\u2019s most green booths \u2013 in Fitzroy North and Carlton North \u2013 to Wills for the first time.\n\nThis is likely to hand Ratnam and the Greens an advantage. However, as I moved around the seat in the past week, preparing for the launch of this blog today, I noticed plenty of Peter Khalil signs on house fences in both Carlton North and Fitzroy North. Maybe that advantage, like so many Greens predictions of victory here, will be an illusion again. It\u2019s been a phenomenon in this seat for more than a decade that the Greens talk up their chance of snatching Wills from Labor and then ultimately a win fails to materialise.\n\nAt the 2022 election, I spent six fascinating weeks in the seat of Chisholm, roaming its suburbs, which include Box Hill, Burwood, Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley. There, it was clear a few weeks out that Liberal MP Gladys Liu would struggle to hold the seat from Labor\u2019s Carina Garland. Ultimately, Garland won easily with a 7 per cent swing to her and Labor. So far in Wills, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the Greens\u2019 talk of this being a potential win is just that \u2013 talk \u2013 or if the voters of this economically and ethnically diverse seat will finally turn out for them. Or will voters back Khalil and the status quo?\n\nRatnam has stood in Wills against Khalil before, in 2016. Then, she came close to ending the party\u2019s near-continuous hold on the seat since its creation in 1949. Ratnam secured 45 per cent of the vote. Khalil ultimately won but had to rely on preferences from other parties. Since then, no Greens candidate has come near Khalil, who has expanded his majority in the seat on a two-party preferred basis to 9 per cent.\n\nLoading\n\nKhalil, 52, was born in Melbourne to Egyptian parents and grew up in public housing. Ratnam, 47, born to Sri Lankan parents who left that country because of civil war, is a strong candidate in her own right. In the nine years since she last ran, her profile has grown and grown \u2013 first as the mayor of Moreland (now Merri-bek) Council, and then as the state leader of the Greens in Victoria.\n\nWills, famously represented by former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke from 1980 until his retirement in 1992, is named after William John Wills who, alongside Robert O\u2019Hara Burke, perished on their ill-fated expedition from Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nAt the centre of Wills is Bell Street, the major arterial road which once acted as the so-called hipster-proof fence in previous elections, with Labor voters to the north and Greens voters to the south. But rising house prices punched a hole in that fence, with younger, Greens-voting progressives increasingly settling in suburbs such as Pascoe Vale and Coburg North. The big issues here, as with everywhere in Australia right now, are housing, the cost of living, and health policy (particularly the cost of care).\n\nBut the vicious politics over Israel and Palestine is the really significant factor in this suburb \u2013 just as it is in many of Sydney\u2019s most ethnically diverse seats. Ten per cent of Wills was Muslim at the 2021 census, so the Gaza war is sure to be a big focus. The first time I chatted to the campaign teams for either side, they talked up what I can only assume is their hoped-for outcome on this issue. Labor argues Israel-Palestine is of vastly less importance to most voters in this seat than the more mainstream issues like health and the cost of living. The Greens say Israel-Palestine is the first thing many residents talk about when Ratnam and her team doorknock homes here. So we will see.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an exciting five weeks. Please send any tips you\u2019ve got relating to this seat, to any of the candidates, or really anything a voter in Wills might be interested in, to my email, clucas@theage.com.au, my Proton mail, claylucas@protonmail.com, or via Signal on +61439828128. This really will be one of the most fascinating battles in Australian politics in 2025 \u2013 I hope you will follow it with me.",

        "text": "\u201cOur user growth is stagnant, revenue is unimpressive, and we\u2019re barely breaking even,\u201d he is reported to have written in an email to X employees. This month, The New York Times, citing another internal X email, said that as of March 3, X had generated $US91 million of advertisements so far this year against a target for the March quarter of $US153 million. Loading In December, funds management giant Fidelity, which has a small stake in X, valued its holding at almost 72 per cent less than what it paid for it. On that basis, the $US33.5 billion of equity in Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter would be worth less than $US10 billion before factoring in any acquisition premium. So, how does a company that one of the world\u2019s biggest investors values at less than $US10 billion come to be valued at $US33 billion today?\n\nThere\u2019s an element of symbiosis to the xAI/X deal. Musk has said in the past that he would give X a 25 per cent stake in xAI as payment for the access to X\u2019s vast user database that xAI has been using to train the learning model for its Grok chatbot. There is therefore a strong link between X\u2019s value and that of xAI\u2019s (assuming Musk did hand over the 25 per cent stake). xAI was launched by Musk in 2023 and has cashed in on what was, until recently, a boom in AI stocks. In late December, it raised $US6 billion at a company valuation of between $US40 billion and $US50 billion and, as recently as last month, it was looking to tap investors for another $US10 billion in a fundraising that valued it at $US75 billion. Now, apparently, it is valued at $US80 billion. That\u2019s a huge uplift and one that has been against the AI sector\u2019s trend, with Nvidia \u2013 the 21st-century equivalent of a supplier of picks and shovels during the gold rush \u2013 losing more than 21 per cent of its value over the same period that xAI\u2019s value was apparently rising by more than half. The \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d mega tech stocks, which also rode the AI boom, have fallen 20 per cent since late December. There was a lot of activity around xAI and X last month, just before the merger\u2019s announcement.\n\nX itself also raised new funds last month, reportedly raising $US900 million or so at an eyebrow-raising enterprise-level valuation of \u2026 just over $US44 billion. Musk is said to have contributed to that raising. It was convenient that, just before the merger was agreed \u2013 presumably while it was still being finalised \u2013 xAI\u2019s valuation had lifted to $US80 billion and X\u2019s had risen to $US44 billion (including the debt). Where, only weeks ago, [Musk and X\u2019s minority shareholders] were sitting on paper losses of more than $US20 billion, they have got out ... at roughly their purchase prices. X\u2019s 25 per cent of xAI had gone from being worth $US10 billion or $US12 billion three months earlier to $US20 billion, and its own fund-raising helped validate an equity value of about $US33 billion. There\u2019s a circularity to those numbers and dealings that, apart from being curious, makes the transaction \u2013 and the valuation of X \u2013 work.\n\nBoth xAI and X are, of course, private companies controlled by Musk, so it could be argued that he\u2019s just shuffling bits of his empire around. It also should be said that, leaving the numbers aside, the combination of artificial intelligence companies and social media, with their troves of user data and vast user databases, makes sense. Indeed, Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta Platforms, is pursuing a similar strategy. It is conceivable that the combination will create value that could never be realised by a standalone X and recover, within xAI, the unrealised losses that flowed from the absurd premium Musk paid for Twitter and the way he has since managed it. In any event, X\u2019s minority shareholders, most of whom are friends and backers of Musk, are hardly going to complain about the deal. They, and Musk, have been bailed out by xAI, regardless of what that convenient fundraising last month might have signalled.\n\nWhere, only weeks ago, they were sitting on paper losses of more than $US20 billion, they have got out, albeit in a paper swap, at roughly their purchase prices. There is a big overlap between the shareholders in X and xAI (beyond Musk) but there may be some investors exposed only to xAI. If anyone were disgruntled by the deal, it\u2019d be those investors, having had their interest diluted to acquire a business, at an inflated value, that is struggling and breaking even at best. Loading Musk is, however, riding high within the Trump administration, which has given him power and advantaged his businesses, and he\u2019s also made huge amounts of money for his loyal supporters over the years. Unless xAI\u2019s next valuation comes in markedly lower than $US113 billion, complaints are unlikely. One of the unusual aspects of the deal is that there was only one external investment bank adviser, Morgan Stanley, helping both sides of the transaction.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump is calling it Liberation Day [[April 2]]... but for the rest of the world, Mr Trump's tariffs are already causing significant grief.\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 2nd has for weeks been declared the date when the US President announces further details on a wave of new reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as nations globally have already suffered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium products - while Canada and Mexico have been hit with 25% tariffs on goods, and China - 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says the President is focused on 'fixing the wrongs of the past' and repairing the United States' economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those days of America, beginning tomorrow being ripped off are over. American workers and businesses will be put first under President Trump, just as he promised on the campaign trail. The president's historic action tomorrow will improve American competitiveness in every area of industry. Reduce our massive trade deficits and ultimately protect our economic and national security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key elements already announced is a 25% tariff targeting the automotive industry, which is expected to take effect on the 3rd of April.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the other announcements are concerned, according to the Washington Post, aides are considering a plan that would raise duties on products by about 20% from nearly every country, rather than targeting certain countries or products.\n\n\n\n\n\nA White House spokesperson has shut down any speculation ahead of the President's announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut countries have already vowed to respond with their own counter-tariffs, including Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney insists Canada will impose retaliatory measures if there are additional measures announced against his country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"US President Donald Trump is in the process of trying to fundamentally restructure the US economy. And that means that our economy here needs to change dramatically as well. And as I made clear to President Trump in our call last week, I will reject, I will reject all attempts to weaken Canada. All attempts to wear us down, to break us down so that America can own us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union has also issued strong words and actions against the United States since President Trump's first set of tariffs last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU responded to President Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs by unveiling countermeasures up to 44 billion dollars [[26 billion euros]] worth of American goods exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nEU Commissioner Ursula Von Der Leyen says Europe once again has strong plans in place if negotiation fails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Europe did not start this confrontation. We think it is wrong. But my message to you today is that we have everything we need to protect our people and our prosperity. We have the largest single market in the world. We have the strength to negotiate. We have the power to push back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico is adopting a softer approach, after a phone call with Canada's PM where the two countries agreed to further cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum emphasised on Tuesday [[April 1]] that Mexico does not subscribe to a retaliatory response regarding the US tariffs but says Mexico is prepared to respond strategically.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Sheinbaum added that there are additional lists of alleged drug traffickers for extradition to the US, as President Trump has repeatedly framed the imposing of tariffs as a response to Mexico failing to stop drug trafficking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do not believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation. Of course, measures are taken because measures are taken on the other side, but the dialogue must continue. It's not about tit-for-tat, but about what is best for Mexico and how to face this situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition is also coming from within the United States - including from President Trump's Democratic adversaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party have introduced legislation in the US Senate aimed at blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York Democrat Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says the tariffs will be 'the largest tax increase on American consumers in modern times'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"President Trump says, quote, 'I couldn't care less if prices go up.' To American families, America, you hear that Donald Trump says he couldn't care less if you pay more. And it's not just a little -- the estimates go as high as 6,500 dollars more for the average American family. To the family that's sitting down Friday night and trying to figure out, do they have enough money to go on that vacation or to visit grandma or maybe to to buy a car.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFears of escalating prices are paramount for ordinary consumers in the United States - including these Manhattan residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nPERSON 1: \"I'm worried about the tariffs.\"\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\nPERSON 1: \"Because it's going to make up most of what I buy more expensive. If it still remains available.\"\n\n\n\nPERSON 2: \"Well, the increase in prices, things are tough enough as it is now, you know, and then increasing prices is going to hurt a lot of pocketbooks here.\"\n\n\n\n",

The national minimum wage has increased by around $7,500 a year since then.\n\n\n\nAlbanese targeting low-paid workers\n\nLabor estimates that there are around three million Australians who would benefit from an award wage increase, including cleaners, retail workers and childcare workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national minimum wage is currently $24.10 per hour, which equates to $915.90 per 38-hour week or $47,626.80 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has supported wage increases in the last three annual wage reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fair Work Commission is an independent body that considers increases to award rates.\n\n\n\nAlbanese has also brushed off suggestions that small businesses would struggle to pay their staff more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you pay a low-paid worker more money, it doesn't go to savings, they do spend it, because they're doing it tough,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\nWage increase will likely be tied to inflation\n\nIn considering whether to grant a wage increase, the Fair Work Commission will consider the current inflation rate. Increasing wages too much could also raise inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could make it harder for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to reduce interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with inflation coming down and interest rates falling, Labor believes it has a strong case for the commission to back wage increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, which is within the RBA's target range of between 2 and 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA made a rate cut at its February meeting that resulted in rates being reduced from 4.35 per cent to 4.1 per cent. It followed 13 consecutive rate rises, starting in May 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the central bank kept the rate on hold this past Tuesday, citing global uncertainty as a reason for caution.\n\n\n\nDutton supports wage increases\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton said he supports wage increases while criticising Labor's economic management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Families have gone backwards under this government,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Real wages have gone down under this government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The prime minister is out there telling Australians they have never had it better off, that everything is good, we have turned the corner, but that's not the experience of families we're speaking to.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Theo doesn't like to be put in one box.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sydney-based actor always knew he wanted to pursue a career in the performing arts. And he doesn't want to be limited to just one domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have always known that I have always wanted to be an actor since I was a very little kid. Since I was under five years of age. Because I enjoy making people laugh. And I enjoy the craft itself. Because in my eyes, the performing arts is a sacred form of arts and should be regarded as such. And also, acting is part of who I am.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat dream was made more challenging with a diagnosis at the age of eight of what is now known as Autism Spectrum Disorder, but which before a 2013 reclassification included Asperger's syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder refers to a range of conditions impacting the way the brain learns; and also how it processes sensory information - such as light and noise.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lifelong condition affects each individual differently - impacting their ability to interact with people and the world around them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can have profound consequences on employment and education outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Michael, he made a decision early on to define life on his own terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I also decided a long time ago that I would no longer take no for an answer when it comes to my goals. Because I found myself taking no for an answer from others. But no one was hardly taking no for an answer for me. So I thought to myself: why should I do that for them?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, at the age of 25, he achieved his first major on screen role, on the Australian documentary series 'Love on The Spectrum', which follows young adults on the autism spectrum as they navigate the world of dating and relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the encouragement to pursue his passions has been very rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What living with it can be like and how difficult it can be to find love on the spectrum (are autistic). Because people on the spectrum have to work twice as hard to achieve their goals; what they want in life. Because there are some people in this world that aren't willing to give them that chance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe didn't find a lasting love interest on the show, but it led him to the relationship he is now - with his partner, Jessica.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has also led to other projects, including entering the world of podcasting and his latest venture: a children's book.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says having that support from those around him has allowed him to showcase what he can offer and contribute - and it has made all the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the task of achieving one's full potential can be understood through the analogy of a seed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How is a peach pit ever supposed to become a tree if you never give it a chance to grow? And the only way that they can grow is to be given the chance to fulfill their potential, unlock their potential, fulfill their goals and become whatever they wish to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also why he supports the latest campaign commissioned by autism service provider Aspect to encourage Australians from all walks of life to improve their understanding of how they can make a positive impact in the lives of autistic people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted by YouGov in February [[2025]], finding that 45 per cent of those surveyed admitted to having a limited understanding of autism.\n\n\n\n\n\nA third of respondents said they did not know what to say if someone disclosed they are autistic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO of Aspect, Jacqui Borland, says the research is revealing on the progress made in the 17 years since the United Nations declared an international day to improve awareness and understanding of autism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So look I don't think there is ongoing research. Aspect commissioned this piece of research just to find out where we're at. So we have had autism awareness campaigns for a number of years. So we do know that with 1 in 40 people diagnosed on the autism spectrum; a lot of Australians do now have a personal connection with autism. So we know that awareness is growing stronger. But the next stage to awareness is understanding. This piece of research was really trying to get past awareness - to just how well people think they understand autism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHeld annually on April 2, the global day (World Autism Awareness Day) promotes the full realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms for autistic individuals, ensuring their equal participation in society.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Borland says the true potential of autistic Australians has yet to be realised, particularly when it comes to employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Autistic people are unemployed or underemployed to a far greater degree than the general population and even to a greater degree to people with other types of disability. So what that tells us is there is this large group of people who do have skills and who do want to work. If we can just understand, make those adjustments to our workplaces; perhaps to our hiring practices in the first place. Then there is a potential to really - for the betterment of our community - include autistic people in the workforce.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says simple adjustments can be made in the workplace that benefit the whole workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nThings like written instructions provided ahead of time, setting up a quiet room for meditation, or the provision of noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the sound level in offices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just being flexible in terms of how you might communicate. The sort of environment you might expect an autistic person to be in. How busy that environment is. How noisy that environment is. But very much being led by the autistic person and what they tell you supports them. Because first and foremost, we know that every autistic person is different. The best thing we can do is to ask them individually how we can support them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor mother-of-two, Ainslie Robinson receiving a diagnosis for autism as an adult was a turning point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I was raised in the '80s; and not much was known about autism back then. So there was the searching for answers back then. But there just wasn't the information to be had. So my diagnosis did come after my son's. I self-identified with my son, which was when I was 33 and he was just on 3 years old and I then sought official diagnosis shortly thereafter. It gave me permission to be kinder to myself because before that period of my life I thought that the way I interacted with people - and the way that I did everything was essentially wrong. And that takes a toll on a person and their mental health - a significant one. Once I had the diagnosis, it allowed me to be a lot more compassionate with myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA researcher and working-in-partnership officer at Aspect, she now spends a lot of time bridging the gap to overcome misunderstandings that impact attitudes towards autistic people.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the best approach is to be curious - and get to know people as humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that is the greatest way to open that conversation in a really neutral way. And over time learning how interactions might be different with that person. Just seek clarity, instead of getting upset with the person. I would just like to see when I'm out and about and I happen to mention that I - or one of us - in our ragtag band of misfits is autistic. That random people that I encounter can say: oh, I know this about autism. Or demonstrate a level of understanding and empathy. I think that would be pretty cool.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Theo says he also supports that piece of advice - and adds: small actions can have a big impact.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points White House aides have reportedly drafted a plan to impose 20 per cent tariffs on most goods imported into the US.\n\nAnthony Albanese has vowed not to compromise Australian trading standards for the US.\n\nTrump will unveil his long-awaited global tariff plan on Thursday Australian time.\n\nAhead of United States President Donald Trump's expected release of more trade tariffs on Thursday, a new US report has taken aim at Australian meat, apples, pears and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report released by the US Trade Representative has highlighted \"foreign barriers\" to US trade. It also mentions Australia's mandatory media bargaining code that requires technology platforms to pay local media organisations for content, and requirements on streaming services to feature Australian content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the news bargaining code, pharmaceuticals, and biosecurity measures on the import of meat and fruit in particular were not up for negotiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those issues are not up for negotiation from the Australian government,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will defend Australia's interests. The idea that we would weaken biosecurity laws is like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia prohibits the import of uncooked poultry meat from all countries except New Zealand, it has strict controls on beef and pork, and also prohibits the importation of apples and pears from the US due to concerns about several pests.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns were also raised about \"delays\" to notifications to patent holders on pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a rare moment of unity amid an intensifying election campaign, Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he agreed with Albanese's stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I agree with the prime minister's position. I'm not going to compromise issues of national significance and importance,\" Dutton said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as plans for 20 per cent tariffs on most goods imported to the United States are expected to be announced on Thursday, on what Trump has dubbed 'Liberation Day'.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Party leaders position themselves on international issues\n\nFor weeks, Trump has flagged 2 April in the US as the deadline by which the country will impose an array of new tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said on Sunday that reciprocal tariffs will target all countries that impose duties on US goods, and the White House said on Monday that any country that has \"mistreated\" the US should expect to receive a tariff.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump also says a 25 per cent tariff on car imports will take effect on 3 April.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is due to unveil his tariff plan at an event in the Rose Garden at 4pm on Wednesday local time, which is 7am AEDT on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House officials say no final decision has been made about the size, scope, and target of the tariffs.\n\n\n\nFactories around the world, from Japan to the United Kingdom to the United States, had an activity slump in March as businesses braced for Trump's tariffs, although some registered a bounce in the race to get goods to consumers before the new measures hit. Source: AP / Jae C. Hong/AP The White House said on Tuesday that the reciprocal tariffs Trump will announce on 2 April will go into effect immediately, and car tariffs will proceed as scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, aides are considering a plan that would raise duties on products by about 20 per cent from nearly every country, rather than the more targeted approaches that have also been considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe administration anticipates the new duties could raise more than US$6 trillion ($9.6 trillion) in revenue that could be sent on to US citizens as a rebate, the paper reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nA White House aide said any report ahead of tomorrow's event is \"mere speculation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican president has already imposed tariffs on aluminium and steel imports and has increased duties on all goods from China, raising tensions with the country's largest trading partners.\n\n\n\nCanada has vowed to respond with its own tariffs, and US companies say a 'Buy Canadian' movement is already making it harder for their products to reach that country's shelves.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther countries have threatened countermeasures as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nSigns are already emerging that the US economy is losing momentum, which some experts argue is due, in part, to uncertainty fostered by Trump's chaotic approach to economic policy making.\n\n\n\n",

We will defend Australia's interests. The idea that we would weaken bio-security laws is - as my mum would say - cutting off your nose to spite your face. In order to defend the exports that total less than 5 per cent of Australia's exports, you undermine our bio-security system? Not on my watch.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese hasn't spoken to the US president on the phone since February.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're putting forward a position. What happens is that phone calls come together when things are agreed. I have very clearly indicated, Australia is not negotiating over the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We're not negotiating over the news bargaining code. We won't undermine our biosecurity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has once again offered his views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is one of the reasons people voted for him, because they felt that he was on their side, okay? And that's the challenge for our leaders, and they've got to be able to stand up. And if that means you get a brickbat (criticism) or a Truth Social post, you know, saying 'you're weak and ineffectual, you don't know anything about China, China' ... If you're spooked by that you shouldn't be in the job.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition Leader, Peter Dutton, is positioning himself as the best person to represent Australia on the international stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter (Anna): \"If Australia doesn't get a tariff exemption, who will you see as being to blame? Albanese or Donald Trump?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the President of the United States is going to stand up for America, I'm going to stand up for Australia. And it seems that the Prime Minister isn't able to stand up for our national security. He isn't able to stand up for home buyers. He isn't able to stand up families, and he isn't able to stand up against people who are trying to do a deal that's not in our country's best interests.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, the Prime Minister confirmed a Chinese vessel was travelling around Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter: \"Do you have concerns about it Mr Albanese?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of course I'd prefer that it wasn't there. But we live in circumstances where just as Australia has vessels in the South China Sea and vessels in the Taiwan Strait and a range of areas this vessel is there. What our task is to do is to make sure that we represent Australia's national interests. We do that each and every day. And I have every confidence in our Defence Force and our security agencies to do just that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton told Newcastle commercial radio 2HD more could be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there are significant assets that we can deploy to provide a projection of our own force, etc, to make sure that we call out the behaviours. The mapping of undersea cables, which is what's taking place at the moment with that vessel, is something that the Prime Minister should be explaining to the Australian people, why is the ship doing that?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton, a former policeman, has been raising community safety during his time in Melbourne, hosting a crime roundtable with the Liberal candidate for Bruce.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe announced more cuts to what he sees as wasteful government spending, saying he'd scrap $2 billion in federal funding for Melbourne\u2019s contentious multi-billion dollar Suburban Rail Loop.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton says the larger rail project is unrealistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a $200 billion policy which is pie in the sky (unrealistic). It's not going to happen. And Anthony Albanese is joined at the hip with (aligned with Vic Premier) Jacinta Allan on that project.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says he'll narrow the commonwealth government spend to the rail connection to Melbourne Airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will take traffic off the road. It will bring Melbourne up to the same status as many of the freight airports across the world, including here in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says that's not how the project works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have announced today cutting for funding, which will be about delivering a railway line to the airport, and said it's about delivering a railway line to the airport.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nLast October, more than 40,000 people descended on Wiradjuri country in Bathurst over four days for the Koori Knockout.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a rugby league competition that brings together Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teams from communities around New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Calma is the National Coordinator for Tackling Indigenous Smoking, and he told NITV the Knockout's major sponsor wanted it to become smoke- and vape-free, an idea he fully supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it's in the interests of our mob. We want to stay healthy. We want to stay fit. We want to lead long lives. we want to be able to transfer our languages, our cultures, our knowledges, on to our young ones.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for the focus on smoking and vaping is clear: smoking remains the leading preventable cause of chronic disease and death among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total health burden gap.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking significant Indigenous events smoke-free is not the only initiative encouraging people to get rid of their cigarettes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also a program at the University of Newcastle, led by Wiradjuri woman Associate Professor Michelle Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the failure of the health system is that we have these wonderful, glossy guidelines that tell you what the best way is, to do smoking cessation. But then when I turn to our people and say, is this what you get? They say, nope. That's the failure. The failure is that we're not looking at a problem, and for smoking being the biggest preventable cause of death and disease, we should be putting so much effort into supporting people to quit, because we know that affects so many other health burdens of disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo that end, the professor and her team have designed a box called The Which Way? Quit Pack.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside that box is combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy items \u2013 also known as NRT \u2013 like patches and gum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've run two trials of the pack so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kennedy says the success of both trials has convinced her that it was wrong to assume the uptake of quit smoking programs would be low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we found was one, we ran out of money so fast. The first trial was meant to go for about 18 months \u2013 and we had money for 90 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And in three months, we had 165 people sign up. Nearly everyone wanted nicotine replacement therapy, and we quite literally couldn't keep up with the demand. We ran out of money. We had to go find little pieces of money here, there and everywhere to keep it going. And so that really shaped and changed what we thought we knew about what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people wanted.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nQuit rates reached 34 per cent at six months of the trial \u2013 far higher than previous smoking cessation efforts with Indigenous communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the next trial had even higher demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the next trial, in eight months, we had nearly 800 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people sign up to the study and start their journey to quit smoking and vaping. So we've learned that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people want support to quit smoking and vaping, that they do want access to nicotine replacement therapy, and that when they're given that nicotine replacement therapy in combination \u2013 which is where you would wear a patch and have gum \u2013 that our people do successfully quit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team at the University of Newcastle say this isn't just about public health: it's about culture, family, and community survival.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kennedy says the packs are woven with cultural pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterally.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the Nicotine Replacement Therapy, each box includes community-developed resources, links to government support apps like My QuitBuddy, videos on managing cravings, and even socks in the colours of the Aboriginal flag, a partnership with Aboriginal social enterprise Clothing The Gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also always add something that builds pride in culture. And so we partner with Clothing The Gaps, which is an Aboriginal social enterprise down in Naarm (Melbourne). And we have \u2013 one of the favourites is socks \u2013 and they have red, black and yellow socks in their box as well. So into the new study, we'll be making some new brochures, a range of new videos and content to explain what to do when you get a craving, working through things like your smoking triggers, addressing previous challenges in quitting and how people can think about those and draw on those to make their own plans for the future. So the box will be new and improved for this new trial.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program has just received a $4.7 million grant to go national.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt means the kits will evolve even further, offering tailored content on smoking triggers, planning for relapses, and helping people build sustainable quitting strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Associate Professor Kennedy says while the materials are important, it\u2019s the way they\u2019re delivered that matters - and by whom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a team (that's) I don't think like any other in health research. So I'm a proud Wiradjuri woman, and I've grown up here in the Awabakal and Worimi community, so very connected to the community here, even though it's not my traditional community. But one of the biggest and best things about our project is that everyone on the project is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and from diverse backgrounds, not just in terms of cultural backgrounds or community backgrounds, but even the skills and expertise that our people bring. There's a lot more to being really good at research than just having a PhD.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong her team are social workers, psychology students, nurses, and tobacco treatment specialists.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome started out just looking for casual work and are now leading cutting-edge research.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir faces are used in promotional material, and that visibility builds trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe've seen in the most recent trial of this that using the faces of our team in all of our promotion on our website builds that sense of trust for the community, because most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people don't want to do research. But this study is so different because it's us. They have trust in us. They know who's doing all of the work behind it, and who's going to take on the work to make this a reality for the lives of our people into the future, beyond just the funded research trial.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that from 2002 to 2018\u201319, smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people declined, particularly among youth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong 15\u201317-year-olds, the smoking rate dropped from 33 per cent to 13 per cent, with 85 per cent having never smoked by 2018\u201319, up from 72 per cent in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall smoking among Indigenous Australians aged 15 and over fell from 48 per cent to 41 per cent, and daily smoking dropped from 45 per cent to 37 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, they remained 2.9 times more likely to smoke than non-Indigenous Australians, with rates ranging from 29 per cent in major cities to 58 per cent in very remote areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nKayden Roberts-Barker is a Wiradjuri man and Aboriginal Research Officer at the University of Newcastle, and is on Dr Kennedy's team.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says quitting is harder in rural and remote communities due to high costs and limited access to support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you've got rural and remote people that are trying to access support options, and you've given them for instance, a pack of smokes is $50 , but then you've got an NRT product that's out there, but then that's $60, it doesn't really entice them to want to quit smoking because of their behaviour change but also the accessibility to the support options that are out there, which I think is a big barrier for our people to access those support options within the small, rural and remote communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Institute's study was conducted before vapes were widely available.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Roberts-Barker says many in Indigenous communities now consider cigarettes to be un-cool, with vapes the new cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the traditional way of smoking is kind of that yucky smell, the segregation, I guess you could say that smoking has, where is vaping is definitely more acceptable within the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany believe that vapes are better for one's health than cigarettes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Kennedy says that is a misconception.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has kept interest rates on hold, denying borrowers back-to-back mortgage relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a move widely expected by economists, the R-B-A's new monetary policy board held the cash rate steady at 4.1 per cent at its meeting today.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets had priced in just a ten per cent chance of a cut, despite the central bank kicking off a long-awaited rate easing cycle in February.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the lack of further relief for borrowers, Treasurer Jim Chalmers maintains that his government have turned Australia's economic fortunes around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rates have already started coming down this year and that's a good thing. When we came to office inflation and interest rates were both rising and now inflation and interest rates are both falling. This reflects the progress we've made together as Australians on inflation. Now we know that cost-of-living is front-of-mind for many Australians and it's absolutely front-and-centre in the budget I handed down last week and it's central to the big differences between the parties as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says Australia will not compromise on bio-security, medicine prices or its crackdown on social media companies when negotiating on trade with the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese was asked about a new U-S trade report which lists a series of grievances the Trump administration has with the Australian government.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes ahead of a new wave of tariffs due to be announced on what Donald Trump has called \"liberation day\" later this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says he's still hoping for a positive outcome from negotiations with the U-S, but not at any cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One is the news bargaining code, the second is pharmaceuticals and the third is bio-security. Those issues are not up for negotiation from the Australian Government. We will defend Australia's interests. The idea that we would weakened bio-security laws is like cutting off your nose to spite your face. In order to defend the exports that total less than 5 per cent of Australia's exports, you undermine our bio-security system. Not on my watch.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong says Australia is reshaping its humanitarian priorities in the wake of the United States slashing its global aid program.\n\n\n\n\n\nU-S President Donald Trump is currently dismantling U-S-A-I-D, the agency responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of its grants are being terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move is already having severe repercussions for impoverished or war-stricken countries who remain reliant on international assistance for food and medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the latest federal budget, the Albanese government delivered a slight boost to the $5 billion annual foreign aid spend in line with inflation, redirecting a $120 million from global funds to programs in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Wong says Australia must focus on its immediate security interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was an increase in the budget in aid in accordance with indexation and its a big difference from the billions of dollars that Peter Dutton and the Coalition took out of aid while in office which left a vacuum in the Pacific for others to fill so had a direct impact on Australia's national security. We have reshaped the aid budget to reflect the reality of the U-S-AID cuts. The vast majority of Australian aid goes to the Pacific and Southeast Asia because it's in this region that Australia's security interests lie.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says education funding should be made conditional upon whether states can agree to remove what he calls a \"woke agenda\" from Australian schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to Sky News last night, Mr Dutton says he believes students are being indoctrinated at their schools with an agenda stemming from universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also raised potential cuts to the Education Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd today, when asked again about the issue, he says he wants students to think for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to make sure our kids, whether they are school or secondary school or young Australians at universities, are receiving the education of their parents would expect them to receive. And our position will reflect community standards in relation to what is being taught at our schools and our universities. I support young Australians being able to think freely, being able to assess what is before them, and not being indoctrinated with what is the agenda of others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare has condemned Opposition leader Peter Dutton's claims that Australian schools have been infiltrated by a \"woke agenda\", claiming children should be protected from the Coalition's own agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Clare says the school curriculum Mr Dutton's complaining about is one approved by the Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m focused on making sure that our kids can read and write, not this extreme agenda of Peter Dutton. The curriculum that he's talking about is a curriculum that was signed off on by the former Liberal government three years ago today, 1st of April 2022. When Peter Dutton started saying today that he\u2019s going to cut funding to health and education, I thought it was an April fool\u2019s, but he said it last night as well. And that should put the fear of God into any Australian that cares about our kids.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nPoland's Secretary of State says United States President Donald Trump must act economically against Russia if he wants the war in Ukraine to end quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as MrTrump says he doesn't want to move forward on previously threatened tariffs on Russia as he pushes for Russian President Vladimir Putin to follow through on his part of the proposed peace deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, the U-S and European Union applied tariffs aimed at blocking their international oil sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, Russia has used what's been called a \"shadow fleet\" of 1000 ships to evade these sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolish Secretary of State W\u026badys\u026baw Bartoszewski told S-B-S that if Mr Trump punishes countries that accept Russian oil, Russia will be under pressure to end the war soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if President Trump wants to have a quick peace agreement on reasonable terms, he has to put pressure on Putin. So we'll see. I mean secondary sanctions on countries which buy near Russian oil and gas would be lethal for Russia. Lethal. Absolutely, because all the money they make is because of selling illegal sales of oil and gas because they cannot sell it by pipelines. So we'll see. But that would be the most effective way to end the war fast.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cricket, opening batsman Sam Konstas has earned his first central contract with Cricket Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19-year-old rose to fame upon the international cricket scene with a spectacular innings on test debut in December against India in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe central contract will put him on an annual retainer worth at least several hundred thousand dollars - and that's before any match payments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chair of Selectors for the men's national team, George Bailey, says Konstas is a young player with promising upside who will continue to develop.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "An average borrower may be able to take out an extra $40,000 for their home loan if the Coalition wins the upcoming federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition housing spokesperson Michael Sukkar said on Tuesday the Coalition would reform the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) if elected, so that it must consider the impact of its rules on access to housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSukkar said this included reducing the \"overly cautious\" serviceability buffer to increase a buyer's borrowing power if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently APRA requires banks to consider the capacity of a borrower to pay back their loan if interest rates rise by 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis buffer was raised to 3 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic when the official cash rate was at an all-time low of 0.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSukkar said reducing the buffer could result in thousands more first home buyers securing mortgages.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial comparison site Canstar has calculated that someone on an average full-time salary of $103,024 per year could borrow $40,000 more if the buffer was reduced to 2 per cent (instead of the current 3 per cent), on a 30-year-loan with a 6 per cent interest rate.\n\n\n\nBut it's unclear how much the serviceability buffer would drop by even if the Coalition was elected. Opposition leader Peter Dutton acknowledged: \"ultimately it is a decision for APRA\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But our position is to make sure that you can get into housing as quickly as possible\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSukkar also flagged changes to lenders mortgage insurance (LMI) so that buyers whose parents are unable or unwilling to guarantee their loans are not disadvantaged.\n\n\n\n\n\nLMI is usually required to be paid if a buyer can't raise a 20 per cent deposit for a loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don\u2019t think they should be paying higher interest rates,\" Sukkar said.\n\n\n\nAre there any downsides to changing the serviceability buffer?\n\nMardy Chiah, associate professor of finance at the University of Newcastle, said reducing the serviceability buffer could increase borrowing power but warned it could also increase house prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The increased borrowing capacity may fuel housing demand, which potentially increases house prices further \u2014 offsetting the benefit of increased borrowing capacity,\" Chiah said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential changes to LMI would also enable buyers to borrow more money.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Are international students to blame for the housing crisis?\n\nBut Sukkar said would like to see the buffer changed to be more responsive to market pressures and interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has to be a buffer that ultimately adjusts with the market,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No bank is incentivised to lend to someone who can't repay them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change has also been backed by the Property Council of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sadly, it has never been harder for first-home buyers in this country,\" chief executive Mike Zorbas said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"APRA should factor in first-time buyers when shaping regulations with an eye to boosting homeownership, maintaining balance and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions.\"\n\n\n\n'Hard to work out', Albanese says\n\nCommenting on the Coalition's plan, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was \"hard\" to work out exactly what it was promising first home buyers, while highlighting his own policy for young house seekers.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Cost of Living Secrets: Mortgages SBS News 07/05/2024 25:50 Play\n\n\"One of the things that we have done is to ensure that banks won't take into account people's HECS debt which is really important,\" he told reporters on Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese said students would also be provided with a further 20 per cent discount off their higher education debt, on top of the $3 billion the government had reduced HECS debt by [through] changing the indexation arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'll [also] give every young person a tax cut.\"\n\n\n\n",

Back in class and looks a good chance. 9. Just A Journey is on debut after a couple of recent trials where she wasn\u2019t asked for a lot over the shorter trips. Bred to love this sort of trip fresh and is one to keep an eye on. 8. I Am Overs debuted with a close third in a small field at Gosford a couple of weeks ago. Likely improver on that and is in the mix. 2. Gaeilge hasn\u2019t yet lived up to early promise but gave a sight when third at Newcastle behind Buffalo after leading. How to play it: Ohope WIN\n\n1. Engine Room looks a promising type, and he comes through a strong maiden from back in October where he split Snitzanova and Brigidine Gal at Kensington. If he handles the ground he will be a major player. 9. She Rex hasn\u2019t done a lot wrong in her three starts for as many placings at the end of last year. Muswellbrook trial winner a couple of weeks ago and is capable of showing up. 7. Manukau was a shade disappointing on debut but improved with a closing second at Hawkesbury last time out. Still on the up and a wet track might be a plus. 3. Now Is The Hour us on the way up and has been right in the market in his two runs back. Extra trip might suit him now.\n\nHow to play it: Engine Room WIN\n\nRace 3\n\n12. Modella is straight out of maiden company, but she couldn\u2019t have been any more impressive showing a sharp dash to score easily at Kembla back in late January. Placed here on a wet track on debut. 9. California Sunrise hasn\u2019t finished worse than fourth in seven starts and while best is probably at 1400m plus she can run a race fresh. Have to keep her safe. 8. Linwood wasn\u2019t fancied in betting at her only start but swept home to win on a heavy track here back in July. While 1200m likely short of her best this prep she could show up.\n\nHow to play it: Modella WIN\n\nRace 4\n\n5. Dr Evil ran about as well as he could on a dry track coming off a seven-week break at Hawkesbury, running into third. Loves a wet track and around the mile is his sweet spot so he has to be a good each-way chance in an open race. 2. Arqana was a solid favourite at Flemington a month ago and didn\u2019t really make an impact, staying about midfield all the way. Never won on a good track, so the conditions will suit her this time. 7. Imposing Pier looked the winner when he darted through on the inside at Hawkesbury last time only to be nailed on the line. Consistent type who can be around the mark again. 8. Inferencia is in career-best form and is in line for a hat-trick after leading all the way in a Midway at Rosehill. Has a show.\n\nHow to play it: Dr Evil EACH-WAY",

Others are more specific to a particular era, like the thrill of getting an obscure record mailed to you from overseas, followed by the bitter discovery it\u2019s warped. This is among the first of many misfortunes to befall Angus (Ed Oxenbould), the hapless hero of Jonathan Ogilvie\u2019s nostalgic teen movie Head South, set in Christchurch at the end of the 1970s. When Angus does get to listen to the debut single from John Lydon\u2019s Public Image Ltd, his world changes, as the film signals by shifting to widescreen. Before long, he\u2019s ditching his shaggy haircut for short back and sides, adding staples to his school uniform and dreaming about starting a band. Ed Ozenbould is a mild-mannered New Zealand sort of punk. Credit:\n\nHe\u2019s a very New Zealand sort of punk, apologising that his hair isn\u2019t all it should be (\u201cI\u2019m trying to get it to stick up more\u201d). He also can\u2019t stop smiling \u2013 partly from anxiety, but also from mingled joy and relief at having found his tribe. As it turns out, everyone on the local scene is a poseur of one sort or another. If anything, the coolest guy in sight is Angus\u2019 morose but kindly dad Gordon (the versatile veteran Marton Csokas), with his tweed suits and a voice that could be used to advertise whisky. Angus himself is a comparably unexpected mix of traits, a gormless innocent who might still have some potential as a stage performer along Ian Curtis lines (Oxenbould, an Australian who became an internationally known child star a decade ago, is an actor to look out for). A New Zealander who has worked a good deal in Australia, Ogilvie has had an odd, mostly under-the-radar career, combining a furtive temperament with a fondness for gimmicks. Such gimmicks aren\u2019t absent here, ranging from visual tricks such as jump cuts and film burn effects to the convoluted metaphor alluded to in the title. Still, this is the film where Ogilvie shows what he really has in him. You don\u2019t have to know he started out in the 1980s directing music videos for Christchurch\u2019s Flying Nun label \u2013 which gets a shout-out here \u2013 to deduce that portions of Angus\u2019 story must be autobiographical.",

        "text": "Hi, over the next five weeks, I\u2019ll be blogging about the seat of Wills as the 2025 federal election unfolds.\n\nI\u2019m normally an investigative reporter for The Age \u2013 investigative reporters never miss an opportunity to push their stories, so please read my most recent reporting on Australia\u2019s $4 billion cosmetic injectables industry here. But during the federal election, I\u2019ll follow full-time Labor MP Peter Khalil, the Greens\u2019 Samantha Ratnam, Liberal Jeff Kidney, Socialist Sue Bolton, and all of the other candidates in this northern suburbs seat.\n\nLabor\u2019s Peter Khalil, Sydney Road, Brunswick, and the Greens\u2019 Samantha Ratnam. Credit: Marija Ercegovac\n\nWills covers progressive northern suburbs like Brunswick and Coburg, and Labor-leaning areas like Pascoe Vale, Fawkner, Oak Park and Glenroy. But a redistribution has added some of Australia\u2019s most green booths \u2013 in Fitzroy North and Carlton North \u2013 to Wills for the first time.\n\nThis is likely to hand Ratnam and the Greens an advantage. However, as I moved around the seat in the past week, preparing for the launch of this blog today, I noticed plenty of Peter Khalil signs on house fences in both Carlton North and Fitzroy North. Maybe that advantage, like so many Greens predictions of victory here, will be an illusion again. It\u2019s been a phenomenon in this seat for more than a decade that the Greens talk up their chance of snatching Wills from Labor and then ultimately a win fails to materialise.\n\nAt the 2022 election, I spent six fascinating weeks in the seat of Chisholm, roaming its suburbs, which include Box Hill, Burwood, Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley. There, it was clear a few weeks out that Liberal MP Gladys Liu would struggle to hold the seat from Labor\u2019s Carina Garland. Ultimately, Garland won easily with a 7 per cent swing to her and Labor. So far in Wills, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the Greens\u2019 talk of this being a potential win is just that \u2013 talk \u2013 or if the voters of this economically and ethnically diverse seat will finally turn out for them. Or will voters back Khalil and the status quo?\n\nRatnam has stood in Wills against Khalil before, in 2016. Then, she came close to ending the party\u2019s near-continuous hold on the seat since its creation in 1949. Ratnam secured 45 per cent of the vote. Khalil ultimately won but had to rely on preferences from other parties. Since then, no Greens candidate has come near Khalil, who has expanded his majority in the seat on a two-party preferred basis to 9 per cent.\n\nLoading\n\nKhalil, 52, was born in Melbourne to Egyptian parents and grew up in public housing. Ratnam, 47, born to Sri Lankan parents who left that country because of civil war, is a strong candidate in her own right. In the nine years since she last ran, her profile has grown and grown \u2013 first as the mayor of Moreland (now Merri-bek) Council, and then as the state leader of the Greens in Victoria.\n\nWills, famously represented by former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke from 1980 until his retirement in 1992, is named after William John Wills who, alongside Robert O\u2019Hara Burke, perished on their ill-fated expedition from Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nAt the centre of Wills is Bell Street, the major arterial road which once acted as the so-called hipster-proof fence in previous elections, with Labor voters to the north and Greens voters to the south. But rising house prices punched a hole in that fence, with younger, Greens-voting progressives increasingly settling in suburbs such as Pascoe Vale and Coburg North. The big issues here, as with everywhere in Australia right now, are housing, the cost of living, and health policy (particularly the cost of care).\n\nBut the vicious politics over Israel and Palestine is the really significant factor in this suburb \u2013 just as it is in many of Sydney\u2019s most ethnically diverse seats. Ten per cent of Wills was Muslim at the 2021 census, so the Gaza war is sure to be a big focus. The first time I chatted to the campaign teams for either side, they talked up what I can only assume is their hoped-for outcome on this issue. Labor argues Israel-Palestine is of vastly less importance to most voters in this seat than the more mainstream issues like health and the cost of living. The Greens say Israel-Palestine is the first thing many residents talk about when Ratnam and her team doorknock homes here. So we will see.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an exciting five weeks. Please send any tips you\u2019ve got relating to this seat, to any of the candidates, or really anything a voter in Wills might be interested in, to my email, clucas@theage.com.au, my Proton mail, claylucas@protonmail.com, or via Signal on +61439828128. This really will be one of the most fascinating battles in Australian politics in 2025 \u2013 I hope you will follow it with me.",

        "text": "\u201cOur user growth is stagnant, revenue is unimpressive, and we\u2019re barely breaking even,\u201d he is reported to have written in an email to X employees. This month, The New York Times, citing another internal X email, said that as of March 3, X had generated $US91 million of advertisements so far this year against a target for the March quarter of $US153 million. Loading In December, funds management giant Fidelity, which has a small stake in X, valued its holding at almost 72 per cent less than what it paid for it. On that basis, the $US33.5 billion of equity in Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter would be worth less than $US10 billion before factoring in any acquisition premium. So, how does a company that one of the world\u2019s biggest investors values at less than $US10 billion come to be valued at $US33 billion today?\n\nThere\u2019s an element of symbiosis to the xAI/X deal. Musk has said in the past that he would give X a 25 per cent stake in xAI as payment for the access to X\u2019s vast user database that xAI has been using to train the learning model for its Grok chatbot. There is therefore a strong link between X\u2019s value and that of xAI\u2019s (assuming Musk did hand over the 25 per cent stake). xAI was launched by Musk in 2023 and has cashed in on what was, until recently, a boom in AI stocks. In late December, it raised $US6 billion at a company valuation of between $US40 billion and $US50 billion and, as recently as last month, it was looking to tap investors for another $US10 billion in a fundraising that valued it at $US75 billion. Now, apparently, it is valued at $US80 billion. That\u2019s a huge uplift and one that has been against the AI sector\u2019s trend, with Nvidia \u2013 the 21st-century equivalent of a supplier of picks and shovels during the gold rush \u2013 losing more than 21 per cent of its value over the same period that xAI\u2019s value was apparently rising by more than half. The \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d mega tech stocks, which also rode the AI boom, have fallen 20 per cent since late December. There was a lot of activity around xAI and X last month, just before the merger\u2019s announcement.\n\nX itself also raised new funds last month, reportedly raising $US900 million or so at an eyebrow-raising enterprise-level valuation of \u2026 just over $US44 billion. Musk is said to have contributed to that raising. It was convenient that, just before the merger was agreed \u2013 presumably while it was still being finalised \u2013 xAI\u2019s valuation had lifted to $US80 billion and X\u2019s had risen to $US44 billion (including the debt). Where, only weeks ago, [Musk and X\u2019s minority shareholders] were sitting on paper losses of more than $US20 billion, they have got out ... at roughly their purchase prices. X\u2019s 25 per cent of xAI had gone from being worth $US10 billion or $US12 billion three months earlier to $US20 billion, and its own fund-raising helped validate an equity value of about $US33 billion. There\u2019s a circularity to those numbers and dealings that, apart from being curious, makes the transaction \u2013 and the valuation of X \u2013 work.\n\nBoth xAI and X are, of course, private companies controlled by Musk, so it could be argued that he\u2019s just shuffling bits of his empire around. It also should be said that, leaving the numbers aside, the combination of artificial intelligence companies and social media, with their troves of user data and vast user databases, makes sense. Indeed, Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta Platforms, is pursuing a similar strategy. It is conceivable that the combination will create value that could never be realised by a standalone X and recover, within xAI, the unrealised losses that flowed from the absurd premium Musk paid for Twitter and the way he has since managed it. In any event, X\u2019s minority shareholders, most of whom are friends and backers of Musk, are hardly going to complain about the deal. They, and Musk, have been bailed out by xAI, regardless of what that convenient fundraising last month might have signalled.\n\nWhere, only weeks ago, they were sitting on paper losses of more than $US20 billion, they have got out, albeit in a paper swap, at roughly their purchase prices. There is a big overlap between the shareholders in X and xAI (beyond Musk) but there may be some investors exposed only to xAI. If anyone were disgruntled by the deal, it\u2019d be those investors, having had their interest diluted to acquire a business, at an inflated value, that is struggling and breaking even at best. Loading Musk is, however, riding high within the Trump administration, which has given him power and advantaged his businesses, and he\u2019s also made huge amounts of money for his loyal supporters over the years. Unless xAI\u2019s next valuation comes in markedly lower than $US113 billion, complaints are unlikely. One of the unusual aspects of the deal is that there was only one external investment bank adviser, Morgan Stanley, helping both sides of the transaction.",

        "text": "Footage of a Sydney Metro train travelling at speed with the doors wide open has emerged on social media.\n\nThe doors of a Sydney Metro flew open on a carriage full of commuters on Wednesday morning. Source: Reddit/Aggressive-Move-4725\n\nFootage has emerged of a Sydney Metro train travelling with its doors wide open during rush hour on Wednesday morning.\n\nDozens of commuters crammed into the carriage clung to handrails while the Metro whizzed through the exposed concrete tunnel. It was travelling between Chatswood and Crows Nest stations, and the trains are known to hit speeds of up to 100 kilometres per hour. Passengers' hair can be seen blowing in the wind on the driverless train.\n\nBen McKimm confirmed to Yahoo News he was travelling on the Metro at the time and said \"the thing just took off as they were trying to fix it\".\n\nFootage from inside the Metro appears to show two workers in black positioning themselves closest to the open doors and communicating with others on walkie talkies. The digital sign above reads, \"the door is out of service\".\n\nSydney Metro apologises for 'door fault' during rush hour\n\nThe CEO of Metro Trains Sydney told Yahoo News the incident was first reported just after 8 am and two workers on board the train were instructed to try \"remotely fix the issue\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There was Customer Journey Coordinator (CJC) and Customer Operations Lead (COL) on board the service. They were contacted by our Operational Control Centre,\" Daniel Williams said. After attempts to fix the issue were unsuccessful, workers were instructed to \"manually close the door\".\n\n\"To enable the train to complete its short journey to the next station, two staff members stood by the door until the service came to a stop. The door was able to be closed at the next station, and the metro removed from service,\" Williams said. \"We apologise to customers for the concern this caused.\"\n\nThe incident is now being investigated by Sydney Metro.\n\nMetro faces scrutiny as expansion work forces station closures\n\nThe Sydney Metro first opened back in May 2019 and connected various locations between Chatswood and Rouse Hill's Tallawong station in the city's north. The network has since expanded and new Metro stations were opened in August connecting the existing line to locations in the city before ending in Sydenham.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the continued expansion has been fraught with commuter delays and train station closures, making it increasingly more painful for Sydneysiders to get around the city during rush hour. The T3 Bankstown train line will now remain closed for longer than the 12-month period initially proposed, and the T6 line is now gearing up for an unscheduled 63-day closure. Up to 60,000 commuters have been forced to catch replacement buses and it's predicated to only get worse.\n\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, but the disruption is required to complete the rigorous testing to prepare for first passenger services,\" Sydney Metro said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

The area typically floods during the wet season in April, but conditions have been exacerbated by ex-Tropical Cyclone Dianne.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"No one really knows how long it's going to be [that] we're going to be stuck here for,\" Milner told 7News. \"[We've] come up here for a bit of a fish, and sort of took a turn for the worse.\n\n\"No one really knows what's happening.\"\n\nWhile the group have been given some supplies to help them pass the time, including a football, it's largely \"a waiting game\". \"No one can really give us answers on how long we'll be here for,\" Milner said. \"We'll just have to play it day-by-day and take things as they come.\"\n\nEx-Tropical Cyclone Dianne formed over the Indian Ocean before making landfall on the Kimberley coast of Western Australia as a Category One system. After weakening into a tropical low, it continued inland, bringing heavy rainfall and flooding to multiple regions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe remnants of Dianne also impacted parts of the Northern Territory and Queensland.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
