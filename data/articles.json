        "text": "It was love at first sight when Yvette Colomb spotted Elsa on a greyhound adoption site.\n\nOriginally a racing dog, Elsa was almost euthanised before Colomb rescued her and gave her a second shot at life, only to see her horrifically poisoned a few years later.\n\nIt was 2020 and they were on a property about an hour north of Sydney when Elsa suddenly started to vomit.\n\nElsa the greyhound was a happy, active dog before she was poisoned in 2020. (Supplied)\n\n\ufeffColomb immediately put Elsa in the back of the car and raced to Sydney, where her daughter took Elsa straight to the emergency vet.\n\n\"I remember I looked at her and it was the last time I looked at her before she was quite disabled,\" Colomb told 9news.com.au.\n\nBy the time Elsa arrived at the vet, she'd vomited again, suffered a seizure and had to be put on life support.\n\nThat's when the vet called Colomb and revealed her dog had been poisoned.\n\nElsa had accidentally ingested \ufeffsodium fluoroacetate poison baits, better known as 1080.\n\nThe poison is used across Australia to cull foxes, rabbits, wild dogs and feral cats by applying it to food items which are left out for animals to find.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nVets doubted Elsa would survive after ingesting a 1080 poison bait. (Supplied)\n\nDerived from a \ufeffnaturally occurring compound found in multiple Australian plants, some Australian animals have developed a tolerance to 1080.\n\nBut pets have not.\n\n\ufeffDogs may also ingest these baits and be poisoned, causing \ufefffrenzied running, uncontrollable vomiting, howling, confusion, coma and even death.\n\nJust a few milligrams of 1080 can be lethal to most dogs and \ufeffthere's no antidote, though vet treatment can aid a dog's survival.\n\n\"The vet said, 'very few animals survive it and it's very unlikely that Elsa will survive,'\" Colomb said.\n\nAlthough she didn't have pet insurance, Colomb begged the vet to do anything to save her dog \u2013 and he did.\n\nREAD MORE: Bullets sprayed at Sydney home as toddler slept inside\n\nElsa's vet bill was almost $20,000 after the poisoning. (Supplied)\n\nMiraculously, Elsa pulled through.\ufeff\n\nShe spent almost two weeks at the emergency vet\ufeff and needed additional rehabilitation, resulting in a $20,000 bill.\n\nColomb paid about $8000 out of her own pocket and fundraised the rest, then set up a Facebook page dedicated to Elsa's recovery\ufeff and to warn other dog owners.\n\nDespite surviving the 1080 poisoning, Elsa was left permanently disabled. \ufeff\n\n\"When we brought her home, it was almost like having an enormous newborn baby,\" Colomb said.\n\n\"She was totally bedridden and it was around-the-clock care for her ... it took her months to learn to walk again.\"\n\nCaring for Elsa was expensive \u2013 she did hydrotherapy and had to be on a special diet for months after the poisoning \u2013 but like many Aussies, Colomb said she would do anything for her dog.\n\nElsa walked with a wobble and had mobility issues for the rest of her life, but her health really started to decline in 2025.\n\nElsa needed hydrotherapy and a special diet to help her recover from the poisoning. (Supplied)\n\nShe died at home in \ufeffColomb's arms in June.\n\n\"She was like lying flat against me, and she had her head against my chest, and I just patted every very gently,\" Colomb said.\n\nDevastated by the loss, \ufeffshe took comfort from the 10,000 animal lovers who had followed Elsa's story in her Facebook group.\n\nNow she's campaigning to outlaw the baits that almost killed Elsa five years ago, left her disabled and cost the family thousands in vet care.\n\nAccess to 1080 is highly restricted in Australia and its use is regulated by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), state and territory government agencies and local land management authorities.\n\nUse of the poison varies across the country and baits are tailored to the target species and the local \ufeffecosystem.\n\nBut scientists and animal rights groups disagree on how 'humane' 1080 is and after seeing how Elsa suffered, Colomb doesn't want any animal \u2013 pet or pest \u2013 to go through the same thing.\n\nYvette Colomb has started a petition to ban 1080 baits in Elsa's memory. (Supplied)\n\n\"It's a horrible way to die and I understand that foxes need to be taken care of, but I think we need to do it in a responsible and humane way,\" Colomb said.\n\n\"I don't think we can just drop poison into our environment and hope for the best.\"\n\nShe started a Change.org petition \ufeffthat has already attracted more than 3000 signatures and plans to petition Federal Parliament to reconsider the use of 1080 across the country.\ufeff\n\nColomb's only regret is not taking action and campaigning for a ban on 1080 sooner.\ufeff\n\n\"Why did I wait so long? I need to make Elsa's memory count.\"",

(Nine)\n\nAnd that's the case even though girls in many parts of the world have access to fewer resources, such as food and medical care, than boys do.\n\nThat female toughness holds true in extreme circumstances, as Virginia Zarulli, now an associate professor of demography at Italy's University of Padua, found when she analyzed survival data across seven historical populations experiencing famines, epidemics and enslavement.\n\nUnder these brutal conditions, women outlived men across almost all ages and locations, including among the \"high-mortality\" populations who confronted famine in Ukraine, Ireland and Sweden; enslavement in Trinidad; and measles epidemics in Iceland, according to her 2018 study, published in the journal PNAS.\n\nEven newborn girls in these environments had a higher survival rate than newborn boys \u2014 a hint that the female survival advantage is rooted in biology.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Ship attacked in Red Sea after rebels claim bulk carrier sinking\n\nSince viruses and bacteria are always mutating, an immune system that can quickly adapt is more resilient. (Getty)\n\nEssential female strength also shows up today in places where women experience fewer extreme physical stresses overall: \"When we analyze the empirical data, for modern people it shows that death rates for men are higher than for women, pretty much at every age,\" Zarulli said.\n\nRecognizing and building on these sex-based differences can help transform how we approach health care, including treatments for cancer and vaccine protocols \u2014 making medicine more precise, personalized and effective, especially for women.\n\nFemale chromosomes and hormones\n\nPeople assigned female at birth have two X chromosomes, a fundamental advantage over XY, the chromosomes males have at birth.\n\nThat's because the X chromosome is much larger, containing roughly 10 times more genes.\n\nFemale bodies therefore have access to a wider range of immune genes, making their defense system remarkably strong and diverse.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Trump announces 25 per cent tariff on two key trading partners\n\nPeople assigned female at birth have two X chromosomes, a fundamental advantage over XY, the chromosomes males have at birth. (Getty)\n\nAs neurogeneticist and evolutionary biologist Dr. Sharon Moalem wrote in \"The Better Half: On the Genetic Superiority of Women,\" his book about the XX chromosome advantage, \"Women have immunologically evolved to out-mutate men.\"\n\nSince viruses and bacteria are always mutating, an immune system that can quickly adapt is more resilient.\n\nEstrogen, generally higher in female bodies, also confers a variety of immune advantages.\n\nAs a result, female mammals \u2014 including humans \u2014 have better-equipped immune systems, in both their innate, generalized responses and their adaptive, specialized responses.\n\nFemale bodies also have higher counts of active neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell that fights infections.\n\nScientists have also found that female bodies have more robust B cell activity \u2014 the action of white blood cells that adapt to fight off viruses or bacteria.\n\nThis advantage may also be due in part to estrogen, and researchers are trying to tease apart what is mediated by hormones, what is affected by genes and what might be attributable to other causes.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Texas flood death toll hits 70 as 21 children found dead\n\nEstrogen, generally higher in female bodies, also confers a variety of immune advantages. (Getty)\n\nWomen produce more targeted antibodies to fight infections and also retain immunological memory longer, making their bodies more adept at responding to future infections, according to researchers.\n\nthis all leads to \"the very well-known phenomenon that males tend to be more susceptible to a lot of diseases than females \u2014 though not in every disease or every individual, of course,\" said Marlene Zuk, a Regents Professor and evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul.\n\nSince female bodies mount stronger immune defenses, they generally have a stronger vaccine and virus response, a greater ability to fight off sepsis and a decreased risk of some cancers.\n\nThe downside of this powerful system, however, is that women get more autoimmune diseases than men do.\n\nWomen are also more likely to live with chronic illness after surviving diseases that would have killed male bodies.\n\nThe effect of testosterone\n\nTestosterone also seems to be an immune disadvantage, and males have more of that hormone than females do.\n\nZuk said that in early experiments scientists found they could \"neuter male animals and their immunity would get better or inject female animals with testosterone and their immunity would get worse.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Father who died saving his family among victims of the Texas flooding tragedy\n\nTestosterone also seems to be an immune disadvantage, and males have more of that hormone than females do. (Getty)\n\nWhy?\n\nIt may be that testosterone enables male animals toward greater reproductive success by \"living hard and dying young,\" Zuk said.\n\nSome of the female immune advantage may be male immune disadvantage, and while it's accepted that hormones affect immunity, determining to what degree is an ongoing research question.\n\nPhysiology and culture\n\nSome scientists argue that lifestyle and culture lead to a significant part of the male longevity disadvantage.\n\nAs a population, men tend to smoke more, drink more alcohol and engage in riskier activities than women, and men tend to exclude most women from more physically dangerous jobs.\n\nStudies focused on what happens when women adopt some of the unhealthy habits traditionally more likely among male populations, such as smoking, still show that women live longer than men, Zarulli said.\n\nAs a population, men tend to smoke more, drink more alcohol and engage in riskier activities than women (Getty)\n\n\"In populations where men and women had the same lifestyle, there was still a difference in mortality \u2014 women had a higher life expectancy than men.\"\n\nThe female advantage is likely due to more than genetic and hormonal factors, according to new research: It's also found in the very structure of women's bodies.\n\nAt North Carolina State University, a team led by microbial ecologist Erin McKenney and forensic anthropologist Amanda Hale conducted a landmark study measuring the lengths of the small intestines in cadavers for the first time since 1885.\n\nThe team discovered that women's small intestines were significantly longer than men's \u2014 an advantage that allows women to extract more nutrition from the same quantity of food.\n\nThis finding, published in the journal PeerJ in a 2023 paper, might be explained by the extra demands on female bodies throughout human history: \"The vast majority of the nutrients you need to replenish your system \u2014 especially during reproduction and nursing, like protein and fat \u2014 that's what's being absorbed by your small intestine,\" Hale said.\n\nThis could be a key piece of the \"Female Buffering Hypothesis\" \u2014 the idea that female biology evolved to withstand environmental and physiological stress better \u2014 according to Hale.\n\nTraditional medical research has long ignored the complexities of the female body. As these genomic and physiological functions are better studied and understood, the drivers behind the strength and resilience of the female body will come into focus.",

(Supplied: Stuart Hurst)\n\nThe 62-year-old went to disembark from the Virgin flight, only to find three spokes of his chair's wheel were bent and there was a hole in the wheel's rim.\n\n\"You've got no idea of the stress levels,\" Hurst said, while explaining the logistics of trying to get back to his Rockdale home that day.\n\nJust a month earlier, while flying back from Auckland, Air New Zealand accidentally left his wheelchair behind.\n\nFlying with Latam Airlines to Auckland in December 2023, Hurst's wheelchair was damaged so severely that the repairer suspected it had been dropped from the cargo hold onto the tarmac.\n\n\"The axle was bent, the wheel was bent, and I was hotel-bound for the whole time I was in Auckland,\" Hurst said.\n\n\"It meant I couldn't go and meet my grandson, who had just been born and was in hospital.\"\n\nAll up, Hurst says he has personally experienced his wheelchair getting lost or damaged by airlines five times in the last three years.\n\nHurst's frustration and despair led him to start a Change.org petition, calling on the airlines to treat wheelchairs \"with the respect and care they deserve\".\n\n\"It's not sympathy we're after, it's just empathy. I just want them to treat our chairs with the understanding that they are our lifelines - it's how I get around,\" Hurst said.\n\nStuart Hurst travels often. Pictured at left is a notice he has attached to his wheelchair for airline baggage handlers. (Supplied: Stuart Hurst)\n\nHurst said there was also little consistency shown by the airlines when things went wrong.\n\nVirgin covered the cost of repairing his wheelchair and offered him a travel voucher as compensation, while Latam paid only for the chair to be fixed.\n\nAir New Zealand, meanwhile, was brilliant in their response, and bent over backwards to make sure he got home safely in a taxi, with his wheelchair delivered to his door the next day, Hurst said.\n\nBut no matter how great the airline's actions after the event, the fact remained that having a wheelchair damaged or lost was a devastating and all too common experience for plane passengers with a disability, he added.\n\nWhile there are no statistics available to show recorded incidents in Australia, figures from the US Department of Transportation reveal that, in 2023, more than 11,000 wheelchairs or mobility scooters were lost or damaged by airlines.\n\nHurst has always been an avid traveller, both before and after the accident where he lost the use of his legs.\n\nIt was during a trip to Nepal in 2018 when he was paralysed in an almost fatal crash.\n\nHurst was airlifted to Bangkok after the catastrophic accident, where he spent a month in hospital undergoing multiple brain surgeries before being flown back to Sydney.\n\n\"I was brain dead,\" Hurst said.\n\n\"My brothers were called into Royal North Shore Hospital and I was on the bed with tubes hanging out everywhere.\n\n\"Doctors said that it was as good as I'd get, and I'd need 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week care.\n\n\"Don't ask me how, or why, but I got through it. I was in hospital for 23 months. I've just been so lucky.\"\n\nHurst's appetite for travel has led him to start the website The Travelling Para and he said he hoped to use his platform to help advocate for the change that passengers with a disability desperately needed.\n\nIn response to Hurst's petition, Air New Zealand general manager customer, Alisha Armstrong, said: \"At Air New Zealand, we understand how essential wheelchairs and other types of mobility equipment are to our customers, and we take our responsibility to handle them with care extremely seriously.\n\n\"We have been in touch with Mr Hurst directly and thank him for bringing attention to this important issue.\n\n\"We recognise there is always more we can do to improve the travel experience for customers with accessibility needs.\"\n\nA Virgin Australia spokesperson said the airline was committed to ensuring that travelling with Virgin Australia was safe, accessible and dignified for all our guests.\n\n\"We recognise there is work to be done involving stakeholders from across the aviation ecosystem, including airlines and airports, to improve the travel experience for guests with a disability.\n\n\"We are actively engaged with government and industry stakeholders on accessibility matters and we will continue to work closely as the new Aviation Standards are developed as an output of the Aviation White Paper.\"",

        "text": "Mirra Andreeva was the last person on Centre Court to realise she beat Emma Navarro, a result that made her the youngest woman in 18 years to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals.\n\nAndreeva was so focused on not thinking about the score \u2014 and avoiding looking at Roger Federer \u2014 that the 18-year-old Russian did not realise the fourth-round match was over when Navarro netted a forehand.\n\nSo instead of celebrating a 6-2, 6-3 win, the seventh-seeded Andreeva calmly turned back to her baseline and started fiddling with her racket, seemingly getting ready for the next point.\n\nIt wasn't until she noticed the reaction from the crowd \u2014 and coach Conchita Martinez \u2014 that it dawned on her she won.\n\n\"Honestly, I just kept telling myself that I'm facing break points. I tried to tell myself that I'm not the one who is up on the score, I'm the one who is down,\" Andreeva said in an on-court interview.\n\n\"In the end I completely forgot the score. I'm happy that I did it because I think that [otherwise] I would be three times more nervous on the match point.\"\n\nAndreeva became the youngest player since Nicole Vaidisova in 2007 to reach the women's quarterfinals at the grass-court grand slam.\n\nThe score was not the only thing Andreeva tried to ignore.\n\nShe was also afraid to look up at the Royal Box, where eight-time Wimbledon champion Federer was sitting with his wife Mirka.\n\n\"I really tried my best not to look over there in the box, because I knew that as soon as I would look there I would just completely lose my focus,\" she said, before addressing the couple directly.\n\n\"Honestly, it means a lot to me that you came and watched my match. It's been one of my dreams to see you in real life. So when I saw both of you I got really, really nervous.\"\n\nThe 10th-seeded Navarro had beaten defending champion Barbora Krejcikova in the previous round, ensuring there would be yet another first-time champion.\n\nIt will be the ninth different women's champion in the past nine Wimbledons.\n\nSerena Williams was the last repeat champ in 2016.\n\nAndreeva will next face Belinda Bencic, who also reached her first Wimbledon quarterfinal \u2014 11 years after making her debut at the All England Club.\n\nBencic beat 18th-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 earlier on number one court.\n\nBelinda Bencic was overcome with emotion after booking a spot in the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time in her career.

(ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nAs one of its graduates, Mr Sands intends to return for another term and is encouraging relatives and friends to join him.\n\nBut he said many might be reluctant to acknowledge their literacy limitations.\n\n\"I tried to tell them, break that shameness, that barrier in front of you,\" Mr Sands said.\n\n\" Break that out of the road and you won't have no fear, all that shameness be gone. \"\n\nFrom student to teacher\n\nThe Literacy for Life Foundation estimates between 40 and 70 per cent of Aboriginal adults have low English language literacy, a figure that is up to 90 per cent in some remote communities.\n\nThe foundation's executive director, Jack Beetson, said it was a real problem.\n\n\"We've got whole households that can't even read the dosage on a Panadol packet,\" Professor Beetson said.\n\n\"Yet our households are also the households that are home to more chronic disease than any other section of our community.\n\n\"Imagine being in a household where you've got sick children, sick adults and sick grandparents all at the same time and all of those medicine doses are committed to memory.\n\n\" If that was any other section of the Australian community, that would be considered a national disaster. \"\n\nLiteracy for Life is modelled on the Yes, I Can program developed in Cuba. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nThe program \u2014 based on a Cuban model called Yo, S\u00ed Puedo (Yes, I Can) \u2014 began at Wilcannia in Far West New South Wales in 2013.\n\nThe concept involves having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander locals delivering course content in a way that is tailored to the community.\n\nDwayne Street's life turnaround began when he took the program as a student.\n\nThe 49-year-old has since gone on to deliver the course to people like Mr Sands.\n\nDwayne Street started as an adult learner and now helps teach literacy skills. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\n\"I'm pretty blessful that I got the opportunity to teach my mob, and hopefully, this will spread right around Australia,\" Mr Street said.\n\nThe Yarrabah local admitted he found the classroom environment \"pretty challenging\" at first.\n\n\"But as we went on, I got used to it,\" he said.\n\nDoing it for the kids\n\nSome adult literacy learners take the plunge back into the classroom to improve their job prospects.\n\nMany are doing it for their children, including Mr Sands, who wants to set an example for his 12-year-old daughter Livvy.\n\nAshleigh Richards, 26, and her partner Lex Costello graduated in Yarrabah just two weeks after the birth of their third child.\n\nLex Costello and Ashleigh Richards say they wanted to be able to read to their children. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\n\"I felt comfortable being around people I know,\" Ms Richards said.\n\n\"When I was at school, I was down in Rockhampton, with hardly no-one I knew.\"\n\nThe couple wanted to improve their literacy to read to their children and help them with their studies.\n\nLiteracy for Life Foundation director Wendy Ludwig said people who reached adulthood without basic literacy skills often developed coping mechanisms, such as taking forms home to be filled out.\n\n\"It's very difficult for people, after having developed those skills and strategies \u2026 to then say, 'I actually need help and I want to learn how to do it myself,'\" Dr Ludwig said.\n\nFunding a challenge\n\nIn 2013, the foundation estimated it would cost $1.3 billion over 10 to 15 years to eradicate functional illiteracy in Indigenous communities.\n\nBut over the past decade, it has run on a \"piecemeal\" basis in different communities where funding becomes available.\n\nLiteracy for Life is helping tackle low literacy rates in Aboriginal communities. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nLiteracy for Life has recently secured federal funding to continue for another four years in Yarrabah, and to expand to Cairns, Mossman and Mapoon in Far North Queensland.\n\nDespite boasting a course completion rate of 59 per cent \u2014 much higher than mainstream government-funded initiatives for First Nations adults \u2014 it has never secured long-term funding to expand more broadly.\n\nWendy Ludwig says teaching adults literacy skills can help entire households. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\n\"By having one literate person in a household, that then has a ripple effect on other people living in that house, and especially in terms of being able to support and help nurture young people,\" Dr Ludwig said.\n\nDr Ludwig said changes were needed at school level too, such as a shift toward teaching Indigenous students English as a second language, instead of framing them as \"bad speakers\" of English.\n\n\"I think that is a really fundamental part of some of the challenges for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids in schools,\" she said.",

(Supplied: Tasmanian Archives)\n\n\"Bathing in the Macquarie River was a favourite sport of the boys, and they were often on hot days allowed to leave school at three o'clock instead of four for this purpose,\" the report said.\n\nDespite the boys' pedigree, it was reported some were still caught smoking.\n\n\"Boys of today will be glad to learn that boys of that generation were no better, and probably no worse, than they are now, and some of the Horton College boys used to indulge, as boys always do, in surreptitious smokes,\" the report said.\n\n\"One old boy, at present in Hobart, tells a story of a schoolmate who produced a couple of clay pipes and some fig tobacco, and persuaded him to master the gentle art of smoking behind a wood fence.\"\n\nPortico of light\n\nTasmanian landscape photographer Luke Tscharke brought Horton College back into the limelight by capturing the portico with a bright aurora australis behind it in 2018.\n\nLuke Tscharke captured the portico with the aurora overhead.

Get them out of the spotlight as well, in terms of not have to deal with my issues so much as a person off-field.\"\n\nRioli said he carried a weight of past indiscretions including his 18-month suspension from 2019 for trying to swap his marijuana-tainted urine sample with a clean sample in a drug test while at West Coast.\n\nDescribing the suspension as a \"dark time\", Rioli feared he may be scaring recruiters from drafting Indigenous players.\n\nThe number of Indigenous players has dropped to 62 this year, from a high of 87 in 2020.\n\n\"I know it's mainly because of COVID,\" Rioli said of the declining Indigenous representation.\n\n\" I do hold a bit of blame myself a little bit for some of the stuff I have been through, in terms of clubs not trusting Indigenous players. \"\n\nThe 104-gamer said he continued his career partly to rectify any such perception.\n\n\"I felt that was my driver to come back to footy \u2026 be the light in terms of 'we can go through this',\" he said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

It's flat, it's smooth, it's quick,\" commuter Steve Jones said.\n\n\" The new highway is great and the job they've done, particularly for the last six months, has been incredible. \"\n\nRita Saffioti says the cost blowout is due to rising construction prices worldwide. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nMinister blames rising costs\n\nIn WA's Legislative Council estimates last week, Transport Minister Rita Saffioti blamed the price escalation on rising construction costs around the world.\n\n\"I am very proud that we have delivered the Bussell Highway duplication,\" she said.\n\n\"It was not an election commitment, but I was very determined to get it done, and we did it through negotiations with the Commonwealth.\"\n\nThe Bussell Highway duplication is not the only road project that has blown out in WA's south.\n\nThe cost of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road that opened late last year \u2014 now the Wilman Wadandi Highway \u2014 swelled to $1.46 billion, more than $600 million over what was initially estimated.\n\nThe Wilman Wadandi Highway links the Bussell and Forrest highways.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nBeside his broken right collarbone, Philipsen might have two broken ribs, his Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck team said, adding he needed surgery.\n\nCoquard looked remorseful when he spoke to media outside the Cofidis team bus after the stage.\n\n\"I've seen the images again, I really didn't know what happened in the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"I would like to say sorry to Philipsen and Alpecin, even if it was not an intentional act.\"\n\nAnother crash with 3 kilometres left felled double Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel, who was able to continue.\n\nThen, with the finish in sight, a few more crashed \u2014 including Coquard, who somersaulted off his bike.\n\nThe 174km fourth stage is another hilly one for all-rounders like Van der Poel and his former cyclo-cross rival Wout van Aert. It starts from Amiens and ends with five consecutive small climbs to the Normandy city of Rouen.\n\nThis race is entirely in France, with no stages held abroad as in previous years, and ends on July 27 in Paris.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nRisks of silica exposure\n\nIn March, the NSW government formed an expert taskforce of government, medical, industry and union representatives to address silica-related health risks to tunnelling project workers across the state.\n\nMonash University professor of respiratory pharmacology Jane Bourke said workers in industries like tunnelling, mining and construction, and those working with engineered stone bench tops, could be exposed to silica dust.\n\n\"If it [silica dust] is ground to very small-sized particles, it can bypass all the body's normal defence mechanisms that we have when we breathe in things that shouldn't be in our body,\" she said.\n\n\"The body's not able to cough it out or clear it from the lungs. And this eventually causes inflammation and scarring of the lungs.\"\n\nProfessor Bourke said silicosis in the tunnelling industry was \"an area of emerging concern\", after more than a dozen Sydney tunnel workers were diagnosed with the incurable disease.\n\n\"It would be naive to think that the disease is absent in other workplaces where there would be a similar level of risk,\" she said.\n\n\" There's no safe levels of silica \u2026 exposure is dangerous and everything should be done to ensure that workers are not exposed to it in the first place. \"\n\nJane Bourke says preventing exposure to silica dust is the most important way to protect workers. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nIn a statement, FGJV said it prioritised \"the safety and wellbeing of its workforce as a fundamental aspect of the operation\".\n\n\"FGJV is proactive and works in collaboration with health and safety representatives and SafeWork NSW to ensure the highest standards of wellbeing for those delivering Snowy 2.0,\" it said.\n\nSafeWork NSW told the ABC it had an \"active presence in tunnelling projects\".\n\nProject setbacks\n\nThe Snowy 2.0 project is expected to provide up to 2.2 gigawatts of electricity to the national grid once completed.\n\nThe controversial project is expected to start delivering power in late 2027, following a string of setbacks.\n\nWork on the $12 billion project stopped in January when concerns were raised about the status of \"last resort\" chambers, designed to be used in an emergency when workers were unable to evacuate.\n\nUnderground work was also halted again for three weeks in late February, after a ventilation fan imploded on site and sent metal shrapnel flying through the air.",

        "text": "Eighteen months after a Broken Hill high school was forced to close indefinitely due to a major mould infestation, demolition work has begun.\n\nMore than 600 Willyama High School students had to be relocated to alternate schools in January last year after the start of term one.\n\nThe public high school in Far West New South Wales was earmarked for demolition last March after an independent hygienist report found the mould infestation was so extreme the building would have to be stripped down to its bricks to be safe again.\n\nThe rebuild, which local MP Roy Butler believes will cost between $90\u2013100 million, is expected to start early next year, with students returning from 2027.\n\nIn the past, locals living near the site voiced concerns about potentially coming into contact with hazardous material, including mould or asbestos, during the demolition.\n\nWhat appears to be insulation and other raw materials is being cleared and pushed into piles. (ABC Broken Hill: Bill Ormonde)\n\nIn a statement, a NSW Department of Education spokesperson said surrounding residents should not worry.\n\n\"Before heavy demolition began in the area, all associated hazardous materials were safely removed, and the area inspected to confirm remediation was safely completed,\" they said.\n\n\"The safety and wellbeing of our students, workers and the community is our highest priority, and we will keep the community updated as work progresses.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the process had been carefully staged to \"prioritise safety and minimise disruption to the local community\".\n\n\"All demolition activities are being undertaken in alignment with the Remediation Action Plan developed by an independent hygienist for the site,\" they said.\n\nThe NSW government announced last month it had allocated more than $50 million in the state budget to start the Willyama High School rebuild.",

        "text": "Jannik Sinner advanced to the Wimbledon quarterfinals despite hurting his right elbow in a fall and dropping the first two sets, because his opponent, Grigor Dimitrov, had to quit with an injured pectoral muscle.\n\nThe top-seeded Sinner hadn't dropped a set in the tournament until falling behind 19th seed Dimitrov 6-3, 7-5.\n\nBut at 2-2 in the third set, Dimitrov stopped playing.\n\nIt's the fifth consecutive grand slam tournament where the 34-year-old Dimitrov has retired hurt. He also did it at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and US Open.\n\n\"He's been so unlucky in the past couple of years. An incredible player. A good friend of mine, also. We understand each other very well, off the court, too,\" Sinner said.\n\n\"I hope he has a speedy recovery.\"\n\nOn the last point against Sinner, Dimitrov served and immediately clutched his chest with his left hand. He took a few steps and crouched, before sitting on the grass. Sinner walked over to that side of the court to check on him.\n\n\"My pec,\" Dimitrov told Sinner.\n\nDimitrov \u2014 a three-time major semifinalist, including at Wimbledon in 2014 \u2014 then went to the sideline, sat in his chair and was checked by a trainer and doctor.\n\nAs Dimitrov talked with them, Sinner knelt nearby. After a delay of a few minutes, Dimitrov walked toward the locker room with the medical personnel.\n\nSoon, he re-emerged and said he couldn't continue.\n\n\"I don't take this as a win, at all,\" Sinner said.\n\n\"This is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us.\"\n\nTwo hours earlier, it was Sinner down on the ground and seemingly in trouble. He was hurt in the opening game, when his foot gave out from under him and he slipped and fell behind a baseline, bracing his fall with his right hand while still holding his racket.\n\nDuring a medical timeout while trailing 3-2 in the second set, Sinner winced as a trainer massaged the elbow.\n\nSinner's coaches, Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, looked on from their box with concern.\n\nSinner was given a pill to take and play resumed. He frequently shook his right arm or rubbed his elbow between points.\n\nSinner needed treatment on his troublesome right elbow during the match against Dimitrov. (Getty Images: Jordan Pettitt)\n\nThe 23-year-old Italian is a three-time grand slam champion who will play the 10th-seeded Ben Shelton of the United States for a berth in the semifinals. Sinner leads the head-to-head series 5-1 and has won their past five matches, all in straight sets, including at Wimbledon last year and the Australian Open this year.\n\nSinner entered Monday having lost a total of just 17 games in the tournament, tying the record for the fewest in the Open era by man at Wimbledon through three completed matches.\n\nRight after he fell behind by two sets against Dimitrov, the match was paused so the stadium's retractable roof could be closed because of fading sunlight.\n\nTwo-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray was not a fan of that decision, writing on social media: \"So ridiculous to close the roof at this stage of the match. At least an hour of light left \u2026 well over a set of tennis can still be played..its an outdoor tournament!\"\n\nAbout a half-hour later, the match was over.\n\nAP",

        "text": "While grazing cattle and sheep quietly move through the Mitchell grass plains of Boyd Webb's outback station, a harvester is reaping what he has sown in a nearby paddock.\n\nHis property at Muttaburra sits in the geographical centre of Queensland and the heart of its grazing country, but for the past four seasons it has also been home to a cropping experiment.\n\nGrowing grain without irrigation, he plans to bury the sorghum being cut as insurance for the next time the rain stops and his pasture dies.\n\nBut far from an outlier, he is part of a growing push to grow crops in the bush.\n\nCrops bring stability\n\nMr Webb has sown more than 280 hectares of dry land sorghum between his cattle and sheep paddocks that he will use to feed his animals in the next dry.\n\n\"As sure as night follows day, it will get dry in this country again,\" Mr Webb said.\n\nA harvester cuts the sorghum crop before it is stored in a silage pit. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nSpat into the back of a truck, the cut sorghum is moved to a deep pit that can store up to 3,000 tonnes of feed for years.\n\nStored this way, the green plant material ferments and becomes silage, a kind of \"pickled pasture\" that preserves the nutrients.\n\nThe silage will allow Mr Webb to keep feeding stock long after the grass stops growing.\n\n\"We're not [going to be] pushed into a corner and have to sell [stock] because we've run out of feed or it hasn't rained,\" he said.\n\n\" If we hit four or five dry years in a row, we'd have enough feed up our sleeves to get us through it. \"\n\nHe plans to expand his crop to more than 600 hectares next year, increasing the amount of feed he can store on the property.\n\nThe sorghum is cut, compressed and stored in pits in the ground. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nEventually, he wants to have 20,000 tonnes of silage sorghum in storage.\n\n\"There'll be droughts here every few years, so the fact that we can grow in a good season and put it away for a dry season is going to be worth a lot,\" he said.\n\n\" Building up to that over a period of time would allow us to basically feed every animal on the place for a year. \"\n\nWhile recent years have been a much-needed reprieve from the decade-long millennium drought, Mr Webb said those dry times still weighed heavily on the minds of producers.\n\nGrowing the sorghum allowed him to diversify and offered stability to his business in a part of the country where turbulent weather was common.\n\nBoyd Webb says growing sorghum has been a steep learning curve. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nGrowing dry land crops that rely on rain for moisture might seem risky in country known for its dry times, but Mr Webb said the rain in good seasons was enough to store moisture in the soil and plants.\n\n\"If you've got enough moisture to grow Mitchell grass, you've got enough moisture to grow sorghum,\" he said.\n\nA tractor is used to push and compress cut sorghum in a pit. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\n\"It may be that you don't plant a crop every year, maybe [you do it] every second year.\n\n\"Basically, you keep letting it rain, store the moisture, and then once you've got enough moisture there to grow your crop, you can grow it.\"\n\nA steep learning curve\n\nMr Webb is not alone in experimenting with growing his own feed.\n\nIn the Northern Territory some of the biggest names in cattle have applied for permits to clear country for cropping, including Gina Rinehart's Helen Springs Station and Consolidated Pastoral Company (CPC).\n\nAt a recent Farm to Feed forum in Katherine, Andrew Cochrane, who previously managed CPC's Isis Downs station in western Queensland but now runs Newcastle Waters, shared their approach.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe said while some feed and supplements were still brought in, having access to their own feed had benefits, especially for younger cattle.\n\n\"That weaning process \u2026 it's a very integral time and a big stress period on those animals,\" Mr Cochrane said.\n\n\"You can smooth that out and keep them on a rising growth plane, we're turning those cattle off much sooner than in previous years.\n\n\"It's a two-fold benefit \u2014 it's not just those weaners doing well and gaining weight, it's the cow's body condition [as well].\"\n\n'A whole new world'\n\nTony Hayne is a vet, cattle producer and cotton grower at Douglas Station.\n\nHe planted silage hay this year and used cottonseed to supplement during the dry season, when protein was hard to source in the Top End.\n\n\"It takes a lot of pressure off through the dry and it's a by-product of the cotton,\" he said.\n\n\" For us, it's probably almost as important as the white, fluffy stuff that comes off. \"\n\nThe cropping experiment is unusual in Muttaburra, which is in the heart of grazing country. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nIn the four years since Mr Webb started experimenting, he has grown oats for hay and two sorghum crops before this latest crop.\n\nHe said \"farmer error\" had forced a steep learning curve with every new crop he planted.\n\n\"It's a whole new world,\" he said.\n\n\"Probably the biggest limiting factor is how quickly we can absorb it, understand it and implement it \u2026 to an outsider there's a lot to learn.\n\nBoyd Webb hopes the sorghum crop will feed his stock through the next drought. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\n\" I knew nothing about ploughs and planters, and I still don't know anything, but I'm having an accelerated learning curve. \"\n\nTo get started, Mr Webb purchased second-hand machinery and equipment, and while that initial outlay could be expensive, he said older equipment did the job.\n\n\"When I started, all our farming equipment was basically less than what you'd buy a buggy for,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be expensive because we're not trying to grow a cereal crop.\n\n\"I think that's where farming is going to end up out here. It won't be for growing cereals, it'll be for supporting the livestock industry.\"\n\nBoyd Webb runs cattle and sheep alongside his sorghum crop at Weewondilla. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)",

        "text": "In other words, Trump, having failed so far to bully countries into offering him the one-sided concessions he has been demanding, is effectively extending his deadline and the period for negotiations yet again, indefinitely. So much for \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d and the \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d Loading In turns out that trade negotiations are more complicated, and his tariffs less intimidating, that he thought. Most trade deals take years, not months, to negotiate. What\u2019s particularly significant about the first round of letters, apart from official communications between heads of state being posted on a privately-owned social media site, is that they target two of America\u2019s major trading partners and closest allies. Japan and South Korea between them generate nearly 10 per cent of US goods imports and are major investors within the US.\n\nJapan is the largest foreign investor in US Treasury bonds, with holdings of more than $US1 trillion, and its auto companies alone have invested about $US62 billion ($A95 billion) in the US auto industry. South Korean companies have invested close to $US115 billion in the US over the past three years and its Hyundai auto group, by itself, has said it will invest $US21 billion in its US business over the next three years. South Korea has, or thought it had, a free trade agreement with the US. Hyundai Motor vehicles bound for shipment parked at the company\u2019s plant in Ulsan, South Korea. Credit: Bloomberg Both countries are critical to America\u2019s ambitions of containing China\u2019s ambitions in the Asia Pacific region and both have co-operated \u2013 at some cost to their companies and economies \u2013 with US attempts to curtail China\u2019s access to the most advanced semiconductors, the building blocks for most advanced industrial and military technologies. It\u2019s insulting to those countries for Trump to say, as he did, that it was \u201ca great honour\u201d for him to send their leaders letters threatening them with punitive tariffs unless they bend to his will or to say that the letters demonstrate \u201cthe strength and commitment of our Trading Relationships.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s invited those countries, among America\u2019s closest trade and security partners, to \u201cparticipate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States, the Number One Market in the World, by far.\u201d They could be forgiven for thinking that they already do. Loading Yes, they, like the other countries being targeted with the so-called reciprocal tariffs \u2013 Thailand (36 per cent rate), Indonesia (32 per cent), Malaysia (25 per ent) and South Africa (30 per cent) were among the others \u2013 have trade surpluses with the US, which in Trump\u2019s mind means they are ripping the US off via unfair trade practices. The view of most non-MAGA trade economists, however, is that the $US1.2 trillion US trade deficit in goods has more to do with Americans spending more than they produce \u2013 living beyond their means \u2013 than it does with unfair trade practices. In the letters, Trump described the deficits as \u201cunsustainable\u201d and a major threat to the US economy and national security.\n\nThe reality is that America\u2019s last trade surplus was in 1975, so for half a century America has sustained, and generally prospered despite those trade deficits without them threatening its national security. Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise the prices for imported goods for consumers, input costs for its manufacturers and disrupt its companies supply chains. Those effects will occur in the near term. Trump keeps asserting that the countries subjected to the tariffs will pay them but it is America and Americans that will have to absorb the cost of raising the duties paid by its importers from less than the 2.5 per cent effective average rate before Trump embarked on his trade war to something, once the reciprocal and sectoral tariffs are factored in, that could be well above 20 per cent. While the objective of the tariff policy is ostensibly to coerce foreign companies into investing in domestic manufacturing within the US, even if that were successful (and any success is likely to be relatively modest) it would take years for new plants to be constructed and skilled workforces to be assembled and, almost by definition, the costs of the end products would be higher than those of the imports they displace. The more likely \u201csuccess\u201d the policy might have in reducing the US trade deficit is if it ignites stagflation \u2013 reduced economic growth but increased inflation \u2013 and a recession that pulls US living standards and consumption and the demand for imported goods down.\n\nTrade wars are mutually destructive, with everyone losing. In America\u2019s case, the damage will be self-inflicted. Trump\u2019s obsession with Tariffs also betrays a misunderstanding of the nature of today\u2019s US economy. He\u2019s fixated on the trade deficit in goods, but the US economy is services-based. More than 75 per cent of US GDP is generated by the services sector; less than 25 per cent by goods-producing sectors. America has a trade surplus in services. In the letters, Trump warns that goods that are transhipped \u2013 goods that originate in a third country, which means China \u2013 will face an even higher tariff. That was a feature of last week\u2019s deal, or at least the framework of a deal, the US announced it has reached with Vietnam, where the \u201creciprocal\u201d rate of 20 per cent would be doubled for transhipped goods. He also threatened that, should the countries raise their own tariffs in response to US tariffs, that rate would be added to the rate the US charges.",

        "text": "It was just the second time this tournament that the former world No.1 had dropped serve. But arguably the key moment in deciding where this set was headed came in the second game, when Djokovic had the chance to immediately break back on de Minaur\u2019s serve. Djokovic made a decent-enough return, which de Minaur countered with a backhand slice, but the Serbian superstar lost balance and awkwardly flayed a forehand well long. De Minaur held two points later for 2-0, then benefited from another erratic Djokovic serving performance in the fifth game. Djokovic dumped a mid-court backhand into the net, then double-faulted on the second point and again at break point to fall 4-1 behind. One last unforced error off Djokovic\u2019s racquet \u2013 his 16th for the set \u2013 handed de Minaur a 6-1 lead. Demon misses his chance\n\nSecond set, Djokovic wins 6-4\n\nAny number of points seemed like crucial ones throughout this set as Djokovic began to assert his authority on the contest, only for de Minaur to repeatedly hit back. After they traded breaks to begin the second set, Djokovic poured the pressure on again to restrict de Minaur to 30-40. An incredible 35-shot rally followed, ending with de Minaur missing a backhand slice down the line. Djokovic sensed the moment, putting his finger behind his right ear and urging the crowd to make some noise. But de Minaur reeled in his 3-1 deficit to again level the set through six games. Djokovic came out on top in another titanic rally in the seventh game \u2013 this time 31 shots \u2013 to leave de Minaur 0-30, and the Australian eventually relented on serve. However, the critical moment for the set was still to come as Djokovic served to level the match at a set-all.\n\nDe Minaur had already had a break point, but the second one was where his big chance came, on a Djokovic second serve. The Aussie pounced on it, pounded a forehand at Djokovic\u2019s feet, then, on a mid-court ball, ballooned a forehand long. Djokovic clinched the set two points later. Impatience costs de Minaur Third set, Djokovic wins 6-4\n\nBoth players fended off a break point each to start the set, and they held until four-all, when Djokovic made his move.\n\nDe Minaur found himself in a 15-40 hole, but a superb inside-out forehand set up the easiest of put-away volleys. On the second break point, he nailed a 206km/h first serve out wide \u2013 exactly what he was after \u2013 that enabled him to step into the court, but he sprayed a forehand wide going for a winner. De Minaur\u2019s aggressive mindset helped him throughout the match, but, just like the previous set, his impatience and lack of execution at a key time cost him dearly. Djokovic leaked a forehand error in the next game to fall to 30-all, but was celebrating a two-sets-to-one lead soon after when he won a 27-shot rally with the simplest of dinks into the opposite service box. The damage was done two shots earlier when he ripped a cross-court forehand that sent de Minaur scurrying off court before forcing him to sprint across the other side with an off forehand near the opposite sideline. Brutal baseline warfare\n\nFourth set, Djokovic wins 6-4\n\nAfter saving a break point in the opening game, de Minaur stormed to a 4-1 lead as he threatened to send the match to a deciding fifth set. Djokovic even faced a break point to go 5-1 down, where de Minaur could not quite chase down an angled drop volley that ended up being his only opportunity for the game. The 24-time major champion made it out of the game without further damage, then tightened the screws. De Minaur defended back-to-back break points on excellent second serves and baseline play that drew Djokovic errors and got him back to deuce. But the Australian went break point down again trying to force the issue on his forehand. This is where Djokovic showed his mettle.\n\nA 32-shot rally followed of side-to-side brutal baseline warfare, but Djokovic took the initiative on a de Minaur backhand slice to rip a cross-court forehand on an extreme angle before crushing an inside-out forehand winner. Loading Starting with the final two points of that game, Djokovic captured 14 of the last 15 to complete his four-set defeat of a gallant de Minaur, who was left ruing his performance on the biggest of points. De Minaur won 36 of 52 points on rallies lasting nine shots or longer \u2013 an extraordinary feat \u2013 but Djokovic claimed four such exchanges mentioned above of 27 shots-plus at clutch moments that helped decide the match.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Reg Mombassa looks out of place in the middle of Sydney\u2019s CBD. As the longtime creative force behind the clothing brand Mambo and frontman of the band Mental As Anything, the musician and artist is synonymous with suburbia: fibro houses, beach shacks, and backyard barbecues, that kind of thing. \u201cI don\u2019t like the city that much,\u201d he admits, glancing up at the looming skyscrapers behind him. \u201cBut I love this restaurant.\u201d Sitting next to Reg is his younger brother, Peter O\u2019Doherty, also a former member of Mental As Anything, and a successful artist in his own right. Whether out of sibling obligation or genuine agreement, he echoes his brother\u2019s sentiments. \u201cI try to avoid coming into the city if I can, but this place is special.\u201d The place in question is The Malaya, a one-time Sydney institution, founded in 1963 by Wong Tai See, a merchant seaman who migrated to Australia from Hong Kong in the 1940s. Formed on a whim by a group of bored art students in search of free drinks, Australia\u2019s prankish Mental as Anything went on to forge a career spanning several decades. Credit: The original Malaya was located at 787 George Street, close to Central Station and Chinatown (the new version opened in April, just down the road at 225 George Street), before relocating to King Street Wharf in 2001, where it became a staple for long-lunching businessmen looking to make a dent with the corporate credit card. However, in the 1970s, The Malaya was overrun by a different crowd: students, artists, and musicians, curious folk who had heard whispers of the signature Sichuan eggplant that would sober you up in a mouthful. Among the devotees? A group of kids soon to be known as Mental As Anything. \u201cWe would come here all the time because it was open late and always reliable,\u201d says Mombassa. \u201cAnd the best thing is, it all feels the same, the menu, the food, the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo prove his point, Mombassa reels off his favourites for the three of us to share \u2013 salt and pepper prawns, the coconut beef rendang and a Singapore curry fish. O\u2019Doherty nods in agreement, before catching himself. \u201cWell, actually, it looks a bit different to how it did in the 1970s, but then again, so do we.\u201d Alongside bands like INXS, Cold Chisel and ACDC, the Mentals, as they\u2019re affectionately known, helped provide the soundtrack to Australia in the 1970s and 1980s. The group formed in Sydney in 1976 when Martin Murphy (also known as Martin Plaza) met fellow student Chris O\u2019Doherty (Reg Mombassa) at the National Art School. Coconut beef rendang: aromatic coconut, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime base. Credit: Janie Barrett The duo was soon jamming in guitarist and vocalist Mombassa\u2019s Darlinghurst flat. Murphy, on guitar and vocals, brought in his college friend Steve Coburn on bass guitar, while another student, David Twohill (also known as Wayne de Lisle), was recruited on drums. According to Mombassa, their first gig was spectacularly unspectacular. \u201cIt was a party in Balmain at Martin\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s place,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a huge repertoire, so we played Can\u2019t Be Satisfied by Muddy Waters three times.\u201d In 1977, Peter O\u2019Doherty replaced Coburn, and the group added Andrew Smith (known as Greedy Smith). With this, the classic Mental as Anything lineup was complete. The group would remain unchanged until 2000, when O\u2019Doherty and Mombassa departed the band to focus on their two-piece act, Dog Trumpet. There was no controversial split; it was simply the closing of a chapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe certainly had a good run for people who didn\u2019t plan on being in a popular band,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty, between mouthfuls of prawn. \u201cWe travelled the world and wrote some great songs.\u201d \u201cYes, I suppose so,\u201d adds Mombassa. I worry Mombassa\u2019s reflection on his musical legacy is as modest as his appetite (my plate is piled with rendang while his sits largely untouched). Following their debut single, The Nips Are Getting Bigger, the band had Australian top 10 hits in 1981 with If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too? and Too Many Times, and in 1985 with Live It Up, which also featured in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee. At their peak, the Mentals sold millions of albums, toured the US and Europe, and topped the charts at home and abroad. Surely, that counts as a great run? \u201cIt\u2019s just a strange thing always to look back, I\u2019m not sure if it is helpful,\u201d says Mombassa. As the Singapore curry arrives, a glorious coral trout, surrounded by tomato and eggplant, talk turns to an upcoming-but-untitled Mental As Anything documentary, directed by Matthew Walker (I\u2019m Wanita), which charts the band\u2019s unlikely rise. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the last 18 months sitting like this, side by side, sifting through the memories,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s good, and sometimes it\u2019s bad, you\u2019re reminded of the disappointing and frustrating moments, as well as the enjoyable parts.\u201d The documentary features hours of archival footage, which means the pair have been poring over early vision of Smith, who passed away in December 2019, following a heart attack. Smith\u2019s death at 63 came as a shock, though Mombassa reliably informs me that the average life span of a rock and roller is \u201cabout 60\u201d. \u201cA lot of our contemporaries and friends are getting sick or dying,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be dangerous to find fame when you\u2019re young, and then it fades away, and you\u2019re not sure what to do with yourself. Some of them just burn out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 66 and 73, respectively, O\u2019Doherty and Mombassa are doing quite well, but both admit mortality is never far from their minds. \u201cI think as you get older, you become very aware of how much time is behind you and how little is in front of you,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cWhich explains why there is a lot of existential angst in all the songs that we write these days.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. The pair\u2019s latest album, their ninth as the double act Dog Trumpet, has a deceptively optimistic title, Live Forever, which is also the name of the lead single. Upbeat as it may sound, the lyrics are quite the opposite. \u201cSometimes I am afraid of everything in the world,\u201d sings Mombassa on the album opener. \u201cAnd sometimes I am ashamed to be a human, it\u2019s a shame.\u201d Salt and pepper prawns: wok-tossed with cracked black pepper. Credit: Janie Barrett Midway through a parcel of san choy bow seems like an inopportune moment to ask Mombassa if he\u2019s really, truly, afraid of everything, but he\u2019s more than happy to answer. \u201cWell, I think if we can\u2019t transform our consciousness, we\u2019re headed for extinction,\u201d he says matter-of-factly, returning his food to the table. \u201cWe need to get away from this obsession with alpha males and aggression, fuelled by guys like Trump and Putin, fascists masquerading as politicians.\u201d O\u2019Doherty feels much the same way, admitting that while the world has always been \u201ccruel and unjust\u201d, a uniquely modern issue has supercharged the collective anxiety: \u201cThe big problem is that we don\u2019t seem to be able to agree on facts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing we can actually agree on is that no one needs dessert. Mombassa nurses sparkling mineral water, while O\u2019Doherty and I opt for a glass of 2019 Morningside Pinot Noir. It\u2019s hard to solve the world\u2019s issues when you\u2019re stone-cold sober. \u201cTwenty-odd years ago, we demonstrated the US invasion of Iraq with 100,000 other people in Sydney,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cBefore that, in the 1970s, we protested Vietnam too,\u201d adds Mombassa. \u201cExactly,\u201d O\u2019Doherty continues. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my point. In my opinion, the right wing has always been dangerous, but considering where we find ourselves [now], people like Bush and Reagan seem almost reasonable in retrospect.\u201d Talking politics over a nice meal might be frowned upon, but with Mombassa on hand to rib his brother \u2013 \u201cYou pining for the Bush administration?\u201d \u2013 the mood remains upbeat. Chris O\u2019Doherty aka Reg Mombassa\u2019s artworks came to the attention of Mambo\u2019s founder Dare Jennings in the mid-1980s. They went on to become synonymous with the renowned Australian surf and leisurewear label. Credit: Mambo Australia This ability to mix light and shade has long been a hallmark of Mombassa\u2019s creative output, whether writing songs or creating T-shirts for Mambo. \u201cThe designs were political but ambiguous, so I often see people wearing my shirts and wonder if they know,\u201d laughs Mombassa. \u201cPeople have made similar comments about our songs, both with Mentals and Dog Trumpet; there is a cheerful melody hiding something deeper,\u201d he says. \u201cBut don\u2019t be fooled by the positive sound, I still want you to think, \u2018what the f--k are we all doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

And despite shunning traditional materials such as diamonds and gold for resin or steel, these unique pieces can still command considerable sums.\n\nIf you ask Anne Rutland, a collector of contemporary jewellery, to choose between a chunk of gold or a well-designed piece of contemporary jewellery, it\u2019s a clear decision. \u201cGold in its raw form is just soulless, dead,\u201d says Rutland, who has spent the last 25 years collecting contemporary jewellery.\n\nContemporary jewellery may not involve massive diamonds and 24-carat gold, but the unique pieces \u2013 such as this collection by Lisa Roet \u2013 can still demand considerable sums.\n\nOne of her first acquisitions was a simple brooch, priced at $20 by Melbourne based artist/jeweller Roseanne Bartley. When her momentum for collecting built, Rutland purchased a couple of neck pieces by Carlier Makigawa from Gallery Funaki in Melbourne. Priced at well over $2000 for each, the value has since increased significantly.\n\n\u201cA similar neck piece was purchased by the Decorative Arts Museum in Paris,\u201d says Rutland. \u201cContemporary jewellery is still fairly niche and many still don\u2019t get the idea of wearing something that\u2019s more about the story it tells, than the value of materials,\u201d she adds.",

And that means that certain powers like our security will always remain in our hands. Now, that is a fact. And no-one in Israel will allow or agree to anything else, because we don't commit suicide. We want life. We cherish life. For ourselves, for our neighbours and I think that we can work out a peace between us and the entire Middle East with President Trump's leadership.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Netanyahu also announced he has nominated Mr Trump for a Nobel Peace Price, saying the President has forged peace in one country after another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly has voted to adopt a resolution highlighting the plight of women and girls and decline of human rights under the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n116 countries voted for the resolution, introduced by Germany, and 12 abstained.

        "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will meet today, and most economists expect the central bank to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.6 per cent, its third reduction this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists say lower inflation and softer GDP growth are supporting the case for another rate cut, leaving the RBA with little choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadline inflation dropped to 2.1 per cent in May, down from 2.4 per cent in April, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrimmed mean inflation, RBA's preferred measure, also fell to a three-and-a-half-year low of 2.4 per cent in May from 2.8 per cent in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevika Shivadekar, an economist at financial services firm RSM Australia, said last month's inflation figures were the decisive factor behind a likely rate cut in July.\n\n\n\n\"Softer GDP growth, subdued business conditions, weak consumer sentiment and tame inflation readings all point to price pressures fading faster than the Bank first thought, so waiting until August to make a cut makes little sense,\" Shivadekar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said projected interest rate cuts are unlikely to have a follow-on effect on increased household spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even with earlier cuts, households are still cautious. Retail sales have been muted, and people seem to be saving for a rainy day rather than splashing out. A lower cash rate will help, but other worries, such as global uncertainty and possible tariffs, are weighing on spending,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some economists remain unconvinced about a July rate cut and believe the RBA may wait until August instead.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian home prices climb to record high amid lower interest rates and supply shortage\n\nWestpac chief economist Luci Ellis said a cut was no \"shoo-in\", but the board would have no clear rationale to hold until August as even a hotter-than-expected June inflation outcome would be unlikely to change the equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A decision to cut in July is one of timing and tactics, not whether to cut at all,\" said the former Reserve Bank economist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the question is now or in five weeks' time, the juice is not worth the squeeze. Just get on with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut independent economist Sherman Chan told the ABC: \"The Reserve Bank has made it pretty clear that the quarterly CPI [Consumer Price Index] series is their preferred measure [of inflation], so there is a chance they may wait until the June quarter CPI data before they decide,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That would be in August.\"\n\n\n\nWhat a lower cash rate means for mortgages\n\nIf banks pass the reduction on in full, financial comparison website Canstar estimates the average variable rate for owner-occupiers could fall to about 5.55 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, Canstar's data insights director, said the expected cut is a sign Australia has started its descent down the \"rate hike mountain\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While the relief from an RBA cut is reasonably minuscule in comparison to the previous 13 hikes, four of which were doubles, every small release of pressure is welcome. A third cash rate cut in four meetings will also be further confirmation we're now coming down the other side of the rate hike mountain,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How Australia's slowing economy could affect your mortgage repayments\n\n\"Whenever rate relief comes, we expect the banks to step up and pass it on in full to their variable customers. This would see the average owner-occupier variable rate drop to around 5.55 per cent; however, borrowers can and should aim lower than this,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Canstar said many borrowers are choosing not to pocket the savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just 10 per cent of eligible Commonwealth Bank customers asked to lower their direct debits after May's reduction, while the rest left repayments unchanged,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\n\nWill rates fall further this financial year?\n\nShivadekar expects the cash rate to end the financial year at 3.35 per cent, implying one more cut following the anticipated July move.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said if household spending falters further, there could be room for an additional cut that would nudge the rate towards 3.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at our global peers, they are somewhat cautious and still responding to inflation control measures, but the RBA is responding to local conditions, including slowing private sector momentum, reduced public stimulus, and China's outlook. All three are very important for us domestically.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "In other words, Trump, having failed so far to bully countries into offering him the one-sided concessions he has been demanding, is effectively extending his deadline and the period for negotiations yet again, indefinitely. So much for \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d and the \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d Loading In turns out that trade negotiations are more complicated, and his tariffs less intimidating, that he thought. Most trade deals take years, not months, to negotiate. What\u2019s particularly significant about the first round of letters, apart from official communications between heads of state being posted on a privately-owned social media site, is that they target two of America\u2019s major trading partners and closest allies. Japan and South Korea between them generate nearly 10 per cent of US goods imports and are major investors within the US.\n\nJapan is the largest foreign investor in US Treasury bonds, with holdings of more than $US1 trillion, and its auto companies alone have invested about $US62 billion ($A95 billion) in the US auto industry. South Korean companies have invested close to $US115 billion in the US over the past three years and its Hyundai auto group, by itself, has said it will invest $US21 billion in its US business over the next three years. South Korea has, or thought it had, a free trade agreement with the US. Hyundai Motor vehicles bound for shipment parked at the company\u2019s plant in Ulsan, South Korea. Credit: Bloomberg Both countries are critical to America\u2019s ambitions of containing China\u2019s ambitions in the Asia Pacific region and both have co-operated \u2013 at some cost to their companies and economies \u2013 with US attempts to curtail China\u2019s access to the most advanced semiconductors, the building blocks for most advanced industrial and military technologies. It\u2019s insulting to those countries for Trump to say, as he did, that it was \u201ca great honour\u201d for him to send their leaders letters threatening them with punitive tariffs unless they bend to his will or to say that the letters demonstrate \u201cthe strength and commitment of our Trading Relationships.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s invited those countries, among America\u2019s closest trade and security partners, to \u201cparticipate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States, the Number One Market in the World, by far.\u201d They could be forgiven for thinking that they already do. Loading Yes, they, like the other countries being targeted with the so-called reciprocal tariffs \u2013 Thailand (36 per cent rate), Indonesia (32 per cent), Malaysia (25 per ent) and South Africa (30 per cent) were among the others \u2013 have trade surpluses with the US, which in Trump\u2019s mind means they are ripping the US off via unfair trade practices. The view of most non-MAGA trade economists, however, is that the $US1.2 trillion US trade deficit in goods has more to do with Americans spending more than they produce \u2013 living beyond their means \u2013 than it does with unfair trade practices. In the letters, Trump described the deficits as \u201cunsustainable\u201d and a major threat to the US economy and national security.\n\nThe reality is that America\u2019s last trade surplus was in 1975, so for half a century America has sustained, and generally prospered despite those trade deficits without them threatening its national security. Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise the prices for imported goods for consumers, input costs for its manufacturers and disrupt its companies supply chains. Those effects will occur in the near term. Trump keeps asserting that the countries subjected to the tariffs will pay them but it is America and Americans that will have to absorb the cost of raising the duties paid by its importers from less than the 2.5 per cent effective average rate before Trump embarked on his trade war to something, once the reciprocal and sectoral tariffs are factored in, that could be well above 20 per cent. While the objective of the tariff policy is ostensibly to coerce foreign companies into investing in domestic manufacturing within the US, even if that were successful (and any success is likely to be relatively modest) it would take years for new plants to be constructed and skilled workforces to be assembled and, almost by definition, the costs of the end products would be higher than those of the imports they displace. The more likely \u201csuccess\u201d the policy might have in reducing the US trade deficit is if it ignites stagflation \u2013 reduced economic growth but increased inflation \u2013 and a recession that pulls US living standards and consumption and the demand for imported goods down.\n\nTrade wars are mutually destructive, with everyone losing. In America\u2019s case, the damage will be self-inflicted. Trump\u2019s obsession with Tariffs also betrays a misunderstanding of the nature of today\u2019s US economy. He\u2019s fixated on the trade deficit in goods, but the US economy is services-based. More than 75 per cent of US GDP is generated by the services sector; less than 25 per cent by goods-producing sectors. America has a trade surplus in services. In the letters, Trump warns that goods that are transhipped \u2013 goods that originate in a third country, which means China \u2013 will face an even higher tariff. That was a feature of last week\u2019s deal, or at least the framework of a deal, the US announced it has reached with Vietnam, where the \u201creciprocal\u201d rate of 20 per cent would be doubled for transhipped goods. He also threatened that, should the countries raise their own tariffs in response to US tariffs, that rate would be added to the rate the US charges.",

        "text": "It was just the second time this tournament that the former world No.1 had dropped serve. But arguably the key moment in deciding where this set was headed came in the second game, when Djokovic had the chance to immediately break back on de Minaur\u2019s serve. Djokovic made a decent-enough return, which de Minaur countered with a backhand slice, but the Serbian superstar lost balance and awkwardly flayed a forehand well long. De Minaur held two points later for 2-0, then benefited from another erratic Djokovic serving performance in the fifth game. Djokovic dumped a mid-court backhand into the net, then double-faulted on the second point and again at break point to fall 4-1 behind. One last unforced error off Djokovic\u2019s racquet \u2013 his 16th for the set \u2013 handed de Minaur a 6-1 lead. Demon misses his chance\n\nSecond set, Djokovic wins 6-4\n\nAny number of points seemed like crucial ones throughout this set as Djokovic began to assert his authority on the contest, only for de Minaur to repeatedly hit back. After they traded breaks to begin the second set, Djokovic poured the pressure on again to restrict de Minaur to 30-40. An incredible 35-shot rally followed, ending with de Minaur missing a backhand slice down the line. Djokovic sensed the moment, putting his finger behind his right ear and urging the crowd to make some noise. But de Minaur reeled in his 3-1 deficit to again level the set through six games. Djokovic came out on top in another titanic rally in the seventh game \u2013 this time 31 shots \u2013 to leave de Minaur 0-30, and the Australian eventually relented on serve. However, the critical moment for the set was still to come as Djokovic served to level the match at a set-all.\n\nDe Minaur had already had a break point, but the second one was where his big chance came, on a Djokovic second serve. The Aussie pounced on it, pounded a forehand at Djokovic\u2019s feet, then, on a mid-court ball, ballooned a forehand long. Djokovic clinched the set two points later. Impatience costs de Minaur Third set, Djokovic wins 6-4\n\nBoth players fended off a break point each to start the set, and they held until four-all, when Djokovic made his move.\n\nDe Minaur found himself in a 15-40 hole, but a superb inside-out forehand set up the easiest of put-away volleys. On the second break point, he nailed a 206km/h first serve out wide \u2013 exactly what he was after \u2013 that enabled him to step into the court, but he sprayed a forehand wide going for a winner. De Minaur\u2019s aggressive mindset helped him throughout the match, but, just like the previous set, his impatience and lack of execution at a key time cost him dearly. Djokovic leaked a forehand error in the next game to fall to 30-all, but was celebrating a two-sets-to-one lead soon after when he won a 27-shot rally with the simplest of dinks into the opposite service box. The damage was done two shots earlier when he ripped a cross-court forehand that sent de Minaur scurrying off court before forcing him to sprint across the other side with an off forehand near the opposite sideline. Brutal baseline warfare\n\nFourth set, Djokovic wins 6-4\n\nAfter saving a break point in the opening game, de Minaur stormed to a 4-1 lead as he threatened to send the match to a deciding fifth set. Djokovic even faced a break point to go 5-1 down, where de Minaur could not quite chase down an angled drop volley that ended up being his only opportunity for the game. The 24-time major champion made it out of the game without further damage, then tightened the screws. De Minaur defended back-to-back break points on excellent second serves and baseline play that drew Djokovic errors and got him back to deuce. But the Australian went break point down again trying to force the issue on his forehand. This is where Djokovic showed his mettle.\n\nA 32-shot rally followed of side-to-side brutal baseline warfare, but Djokovic took the initiative on a de Minaur backhand slice to rip a cross-court forehand on an extreme angle before crushing an inside-out forehand winner. Loading Starting with the final two points of that game, Djokovic captured 14 of the last 15 to complete his four-set defeat of a gallant de Minaur, who was left ruing his performance on the biggest of points. De Minaur won 36 of 52 points on rallies lasting nine shots or longer \u2013 an extraordinary feat \u2013 but Djokovic claimed four such exchanges mentioned above of 27 shots-plus at clutch moments that helped decide the match.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Reg Mombassa looks out of place in the middle of Sydney\u2019s CBD. As the longtime creative force behind the clothing brand Mambo and frontman of the band Mental As Anything, the musician and artist is synonymous with suburbia: fibro houses, beach shacks, and backyard barbecues, that kind of thing. \u201cI don\u2019t like the city that much,\u201d he admits, glancing up at the looming skyscrapers behind him. \u201cBut I love this restaurant.\u201d Sitting next to Reg is his younger brother, Peter O\u2019Doherty, also a former member of Mental As Anything, and a successful artist in his own right. Whether out of sibling obligation or genuine agreement, he echoes his brother\u2019s sentiments. \u201cI try to avoid coming into the city if I can, but this place is special.\u201d The place in question is The Malaya, a one-time Sydney institution, founded in 1963 by Wong Tai See, a merchant seaman who migrated to Australia from Hong Kong in the 1940s. Formed on a whim by a group of bored art students in search of free drinks, Australia\u2019s prankish Mental as Anything went on to forge a career spanning several decades. Credit: The original Malaya was located at 787 George Street, close to Central Station and Chinatown (the new version opened in April, just down the road at 225 George Street), before relocating to King Street Wharf in 2001, where it became a staple for long-lunching businessmen looking to make a dent with the corporate credit card. However, in the 1970s, The Malaya was overrun by a different crowd: students, artists, and musicians, curious folk who had heard whispers of the signature Sichuan eggplant that would sober you up in a mouthful. Among the devotees? A group of kids soon to be known as Mental As Anything. \u201cWe would come here all the time because it was open late and always reliable,\u201d says Mombassa. \u201cAnd the best thing is, it all feels the same, the menu, the food, the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo prove his point, Mombassa reels off his favourites for the three of us to share \u2013 salt and pepper prawns, the coconut beef rendang and a Singapore curry fish. O\u2019Doherty nods in agreement, before catching himself. \u201cWell, actually, it looks a bit different to how it did in the 1970s, but then again, so do we.\u201d Alongside bands like INXS, Cold Chisel and ACDC, the Mentals, as they\u2019re affectionately known, helped provide the soundtrack to Australia in the 1970s and 1980s. The group formed in Sydney in 1976 when Martin Murphy (also known as Martin Plaza) met fellow student Chris O\u2019Doherty (Reg Mombassa) at the National Art School. Coconut beef rendang: aromatic coconut, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime base. Credit: Janie Barrett The duo was soon jamming in guitarist and vocalist Mombassa\u2019s Darlinghurst flat. Murphy, on guitar and vocals, brought in his college friend Steve Coburn on bass guitar, while another student, David Twohill (also known as Wayne de Lisle), was recruited on drums. According to Mombassa, their first gig was spectacularly unspectacular. \u201cIt was a party in Balmain at Martin\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s place,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a huge repertoire, so we played Can\u2019t Be Satisfied by Muddy Waters three times.\u201d In 1977, Peter O\u2019Doherty replaced Coburn, and the group added Andrew Smith (known as Greedy Smith). With this, the classic Mental as Anything lineup was complete. The group would remain unchanged until 2000, when O\u2019Doherty and Mombassa departed the band to focus on their two-piece act, Dog Trumpet. There was no controversial split; it was simply the closing of a chapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe certainly had a good run for people who didn\u2019t plan on being in a popular band,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty, between mouthfuls of prawn. \u201cWe travelled the world and wrote some great songs.\u201d \u201cYes, I suppose so,\u201d adds Mombassa. I worry Mombassa\u2019s reflection on his musical legacy is as modest as his appetite (my plate is piled with rendang while his sits largely untouched). Following their debut single, The Nips Are Getting Bigger, the band had Australian top 10 hits in 1981 with If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too? and Too Many Times, and in 1985 with Live It Up, which also featured in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee. At their peak, the Mentals sold millions of albums, toured the US and Europe, and topped the charts at home and abroad. Surely, that counts as a great run? \u201cIt\u2019s just a strange thing always to look back, I\u2019m not sure if it is helpful,\u201d says Mombassa. As the Singapore curry arrives, a glorious coral trout, surrounded by tomato and eggplant, talk turns to an upcoming-but-untitled Mental As Anything documentary, directed by Matthew Walker (I\u2019m Wanita), which charts the band\u2019s unlikely rise. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the last 18 months sitting like this, side by side, sifting through the memories,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s good, and sometimes it\u2019s bad, you\u2019re reminded of the disappointing and frustrating moments, as well as the enjoyable parts.\u201d The documentary features hours of archival footage, which means the pair have been poring over early vision of Smith, who passed away in December 2019, following a heart attack. Smith\u2019s death at 63 came as a shock, though Mombassa reliably informs me that the average life span of a rock and roller is \u201cabout 60\u201d. \u201cA lot of our contemporaries and friends are getting sick or dying,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be dangerous to find fame when you\u2019re young, and then it fades away, and you\u2019re not sure what to do with yourself. Some of them just burn out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 66 and 73, respectively, O\u2019Doherty and Mombassa are doing quite well, but both admit mortality is never far from their minds. \u201cI think as you get older, you become very aware of how much time is behind you and how little is in front of you,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cWhich explains why there is a lot of existential angst in all the songs that we write these days.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. The pair\u2019s latest album, their ninth as the double act Dog Trumpet, has a deceptively optimistic title, Live Forever, which is also the name of the lead single. Upbeat as it may sound, the lyrics are quite the opposite. \u201cSometimes I am afraid of everything in the world,\u201d sings Mombassa on the album opener. \u201cAnd sometimes I am ashamed to be a human, it\u2019s a shame.\u201d Salt and pepper prawns: wok-tossed with cracked black pepper. Credit: Janie Barrett Midway through a parcel of san choy bow seems like an inopportune moment to ask Mombassa if he\u2019s really, truly, afraid of everything, but he\u2019s more than happy to answer. \u201cWell, I think if we can\u2019t transform our consciousness, we\u2019re headed for extinction,\u201d he says matter-of-factly, returning his food to the table. \u201cWe need to get away from this obsession with alpha males and aggression, fuelled by guys like Trump and Putin, fascists masquerading as politicians.\u201d O\u2019Doherty feels much the same way, admitting that while the world has always been \u201ccruel and unjust\u201d, a uniquely modern issue has supercharged the collective anxiety: \u201cThe big problem is that we don\u2019t seem to be able to agree on facts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing we can actually agree on is that no one needs dessert. Mombassa nurses sparkling mineral water, while O\u2019Doherty and I opt for a glass of 2019 Morningside Pinot Noir. It\u2019s hard to solve the world\u2019s issues when you\u2019re stone-cold sober. \u201cTwenty-odd years ago, we demonstrated the US invasion of Iraq with 100,000 other people in Sydney,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cBefore that, in the 1970s, we protested Vietnam too,\u201d adds Mombassa. \u201cExactly,\u201d O\u2019Doherty continues. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my point. In my opinion, the right wing has always been dangerous, but considering where we find ourselves [now], people like Bush and Reagan seem almost reasonable in retrospect.\u201d Talking politics over a nice meal might be frowned upon, but with Mombassa on hand to rib his brother \u2013 \u201cYou pining for the Bush administration?\u201d \u2013 the mood remains upbeat. Chris O\u2019Doherty aka Reg Mombassa\u2019s artworks came to the attention of Mambo\u2019s founder Dare Jennings in the mid-1980s. They went on to become synonymous with the renowned Australian surf and leisurewear label. Credit: Mambo Australia This ability to mix light and shade has long been a hallmark of Mombassa\u2019s creative output, whether writing songs or creating T-shirts for Mambo. \u201cThe designs were political but ambiguous, so I often see people wearing my shirts and wonder if they know,\u201d laughs Mombassa. \u201cPeople have made similar comments about our songs, both with Mentals and Dog Trumpet; there is a cheerful melody hiding something deeper,\u201d he says. \u201cBut don\u2019t be fooled by the positive sound, I still want you to think, \u2018what the f--k are we all doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "To'o, Haas cleared to play for NSW in Origin decider\n\nBrian To'o has been declared fit for the State of Origin decider, after NSW coach Laurie Daley confirmed he would play an unchanged team at Accor Stadium.\n\nTo'o got through a full training session with NSW teammates on Tuesday night, despite suffering a grade-two tear to the lateral ligament in his knee.\n\nPayne Haas will also play for the Blues despite barely training in the lead-up because of a back issue that has plagued the Brisbane prop all season.\n\nThe Blues' Brian To'o has been cleared to play in the State of Origin decider. (Richard Wainwright/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nNSW used Monday evening as their last major training run before the Wednesday night showdown, with only a light walk-through at Accor Stadium on Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Brian trained all the (Monday) session ... he did everything and looked in good spirits,\" Daley said.\n\n\"Payne did a little bit, but we always knew going into the game that Payne would be on restricted duties. He will be ready for the game.\"\n\nNSW have been something of a walking wounded for the past week, with Penrith players comparing the situation to their injury-hit 2021 premiership run.\n\nHalfback Nathan Cleary has battled a groin issue since the eve of game two, and while the Blues say he will be fine to kick in general play, there will be no goal-kicking.\n\nSecond-rower Hudson Young has also battled a groin injury that sidelined him for part of last week's training, but he too is fine to face Queensland.\n\nBut it is the Haas situation that is perhaps the most remarkable.\n\nThe front-rower was the Blues' best in the series-opening win at Suncorp Stadium after barely training in the lead-up due to a quad strain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe back issue continued to be a problem before he was again solid in the game-two loss, and he would be favourite to be named man of the series if NSW win on Wednesday.\n\nNSW coach Laurie Daley says Payne Haas will play in Origin III, despite a restricted lead-up. (Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"Given what he was gone through in this series .... what he does is amazing,\" Daley said.\n\n\"Because of what Payne has done in the past you are prepared to back him.\n\n\"It probably helps him more than hinders him. He plays big minutes as a front-rower, plays every game and battles on.\n\n\"So he probably needs a bit of a freshen up to be fair. He wanted to do more last night.\n\n\"But it's not about having him right on a Monday night, it's important to have him right on the Wednesday.\"",

        "text": "'No words': how Slater knows what Munster is feeling\n\nIf there's anyone who understands what Cameron Munster has gone through in the lead-up to the State of Origin decider, it's Queensland coach Billy Slater.\n\nSlater knew there was nothing he could say to make everything better when he sat with Munster in his room at Queensland camp on Sunday, the day the new Maroons captain learned of his father Steven's sudden death.\n\nMunster vowed then and there to Slater that, after spending some time with his family, he would lead Queensland in Wednesday's Origin decider - one of the biggest games of his career.\n\n\"He didn't have a lot of answers for a lot of other things, but he gave that one to me pretty straight,\" Slater said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It's a huge game and he wants to be a part of that.\"\n\nMaroons coach Billy Slater and captain Cameron Munster fronted the media ahead of Origin II. (Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nTo give him as much time as possible with his family, the Maroons booked Munster on a separate flight that would get him to Sydney in time for Tuesday afternoon's captain's run at Accor Stadium.\n\n\"I can't wait to give him a hug,\" Slater said ahead of Munster's reunion with the team.\n\n\"Naturally, he's been pretty upset over the last couple of days, but I think the last couple of days he's been where he's needed to be, and that's with his mum and his sister.\"\n\nSlater understood the best thing he could do for Munster sitting in his room on Sunday was to be there as a mate, and give him all the time he needed with family.\n\nThe coach knew that because he lost his own father Ronnie earlier this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There's no real words that fix any of this,\" Slater said.\n\n\"Unfortunately there's not a switch (to flick).\n\n\"I haven't dealt with this as a coach, but I've dealt with it as a person. I lost my father in January. I know what it's like and Cam's an inspiration for many people.\n\nBilly Slater can empathise with Cameron Munster, having lost his own father this year. (Steven Markham/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"He's a hero to many people in Queensland. I can only imagine his dad would've been his first inspiration and his first hero. He'd be hurting right now.\"\n\nThat's why Slater knows Wednesday night is the time for the Maroons to show up for Munster, just as he showed up for his teammates guiding them to victory against the odds in Origin II.\n\n\"Their skipper is going to need them on Wednesday night,\" Slater said.\n\n\"I'm sure it'll give them a huge boost, to see their mate going through something that you only go through once in your life, losing your father. I'm sure it's going to have a huge impact on them.\"\n\nCameron Munster led by example in the Maroons' victory in State of Origin II. (Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nSlater has already seen his senior players leading the group with aplomb in Munster's absence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt's been a blessing for the group to have Josh Papalii, the Canberra prop called out of representative retirement to reinvigorate the forward pack.\n\n\"It's a feel, with 'Papa',\" Slater said of the veteran's impact on the squad.\n\n\"The best way I could describe it is it's probably a calmness. Big Tino (Fa'asuamaleaui) has been like a little puppy dog, following him around all week.\"",

        "text": "All Blacks captain Scott Barrett has been ruled out of New Zealand's second and third rugby Tests against France after injuring his ankle in the series-opening win.\n\nBarrett was replaced midway through the second half of the first Test in Dunedin, which the All Blacks won 31-27.\n\nScans have since revealed a tear in Barrett's calf muscle.\n\nBack-rower Ardie Savea will lead the All Blacks in the second Test in Wellington on Saturday. The All Blacks have yet to name a replacement for Barrett at lock.\n\nAll Blacks assistant coach Scott Hansen said Barrett was a massive part of the team.\n\n\"We're obviously disappointed to lose the skip, but we've got to go forward,'' he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We trust our depth. There is an opportunity for someone else to step up.\"\n\nHansen said it wasn't yet clear how long Barrett will be sidelined.\n\n\"We'll just take it week for week,\" he said. \"He'll be keen to get back as quickly as possible, but we obviously have to do what's right for him in the injury process.\"",
