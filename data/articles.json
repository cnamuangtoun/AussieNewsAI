(Getty)\n\nBut a new Adelaide University study suggested the question of social media's impact on children's mental health was more complex than anticipated.\n\nResearchers analysed the wellbeing and after-school social media usage of more than 100,000 Australian children in grades 4 to 12 over three years.\n\nThey were all categorised as non-users, moderate users, or high users of social media.\ufeff\n\nModerate use of social media has been linked to better mental health in older girls.

The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term.\n\nNow, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's new portrait in the Smithsonian. (AP)\n\nThe White House did not say whether it sought any changes.\n\nNor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions.\n\nBut Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4.\n\nhe Republican administration said the effort would \"ensure alignment with the president's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"\n\nTrump's original \"portrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThat section concludes: \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\"\n\nThe exhibit has had text referring to Trump's impeachments removed. (AP)\n\nThen the text continues: \"After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\"\n\nAsked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \"unmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery\".\n\nThe portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president.\n\nSimilar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.\n\nThe Smithsonian in Washington, DC. (Getty)\n\nSitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.\n\nIngle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.\n\nThe gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.\n\n\"The museum is beginning its planned update of the America's Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\" the gallery statement said.\n\n\"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name.\"\n\nOne of Trump's impeachments was over the US Capitol riot. (AP)\n\nFor now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.\n\nAnd, the gallery statement noted, \"The history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\"\n\nTrump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents US history and culture.\n\nHe has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.\n\nTrump replaced Joe Biden's portrait in the White House with the picture of an autopen. (Margo Martin/X via CNN Newsource)\n\nIn the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.\n\nAt the White House, Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2013 with the exception of Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2013 along with plaques describing their presidencies.\n\nThe White House said at the time that Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques.\n\nNotably, Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \"by far, the worst President in American History\" who \"brought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\"",

        "text": "It's hard enough for women to be taken seriously in the sporting landscape.\n\nEven more so in 2010. And even more so when you're sporting the name of a men's legend.\n\nWhen Alyssa Healy arrived on the national scene, the immediate question was how much of her ascension was due to her skill and how much was due to her lineage as the niece of former men's Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy.\n\nBut it didn't take long to prove it was the former and she's done it for almost 20 years now.\n\nAlyssa Healy retiring from cricket after losing 'competitive edge' Australia captain Alyssa Healy announces she will retire from all forms of cricket after a multi-format series against India in February and March.\n\nIf the name wasn't enough, Healy was thrust into national headlines when she was just 16 for being the first girl named in the historically male first XI at the prestigious Barker College in Sydney's northern suburbs.\n\nAn email campaign allegedly started by a Barker old boy labelled the inclusion of a future Australian captain in the boys' team as \"disgraceful\" and \"an attack that cannot be accepted\".\n\nHealy said her favourite memory of her time at the school was laughing with her friends while watching the principal run from one end of the school to the other to do media interviews because of a \"scandal\" she caused.\n\nWho'd have thought a wicketkeeper named Healy would ever achieve more than Ian? (Getty Images: Michael Dodge)\n\nThat combination of skill to earn her place and sardonic wit to dismiss what wasn't worth her time helped her navigate her own awkward teenage years and also those of professional women's cricket in Australia.\n\nHealy, like Ellyse Perry and Phoebe Litchfield, has always spoken highly of her time playing with boys in representative and high school cricket teams.\n\nThey and others have spoken about how much it helped them in their early development, but Healy has never tried to dismiss the blindingly obvious that that is not every young girls' experience.\n\n\"If you're more comfortable playing with your mates, you can do that, but if not, you can play with the boys as an opportunity,\" she told Code Sports last year.\n\n\"I think there's pros and cons to both. I think if we want to keep more girls in the game, we keep them playing with their friends.\n\nAlyssa Healy warms up before a match in 2010. (Getty Images: Matt King)\n\n\"As the boys get bigger, stronger throughout the late teenage years, that poses a different challenge for us. And I think the girls that want to take up that challenge, I think is a really cool thing, but that's not necessary for everybody.\"\n\nDespite a largely positive experience, Healy described constantly having to prove herself as worthy of a seat at the table as a \"death by 1,000 cuts\" that left her with self-doubt that plagued her even after being picked for Australia just a few years after her high school exploits made the front page.\n\nHaving been plucked out of her casual KFC job to play 10 internationals before she was 20 and winning a T20 World Cup within months of her debut in 2010, Healy struggled mightily for runs and averaged in the mid teens in both ODIs and T20s for the first seven years of her career.\n\nShe recalls watching a teenage Meg Lanning burst onto the scene and blowing everyone away with a ton in her second ODI, another in India and then a 45-ball century in a cruisy nine-wicket win over New Zealand at North Sydney Oval in 2012.\n\nHealy was at the other end on 30 off the same number of deliveries and carried on to 62 off 69, which was then her highest ODI score, but she said watching Lanning made her question: \"Maybe I'm not good enough\".\n\nKnee, calf and hand injuries have sidelined Healy in the past few years.

(Getty Images: Matt Roberts/ICC)\n\nA few weeks of pointless speculation followed before Healy was confirmed as the obvious replacement, taking the reins in 40 games since then, with just four more left.\n\nRecently, injuries and the women's team's schedule have allowed us to get a glimpse into what is surely Healy's future.\n\nHer presence in the commentary box in the past few summers has been one of the smoothest transitions from player to broadcaster.\n\nThat is surely aided by regularly being on the player's mic during WBBL games and easing into that space via her podcast, Willow Talk.\n\nBut most of it can be attributed to Healy's own competence and sense of humour helping her ride the waves that have been crashing around her since she was a child.\n\nHaving carved out her own space in the Australian sporting landscape despite the weight of her last name, Healy has also managed her relationship with men's star fast bowler Mitchell Starc expertly.\n\nAlyssa Healy (left) and Mitchell Starc (right) have handled their public relationship expertly. (Getty Images: Robbie Stephenson/PA Images)\n\nThe pair have known each since they were both wicketkeepers in rep sides as kids in Sydney and married in 2016 to form one of the greatest sporting power couples this country has seen, spotted in the stands at one another's games whenever their busy schedules allowed it.\n\nHealy's role in the commentary box commentating on his game could be awkward to navigate for a less intelligent or assured person, but, particularly this summer, she has handled it brilliantly.\n\nIt would be pointless to ignore the fact she lived with the bloke taking 31 wickets across five Tests, but the conversation has never taken on the sort of \"I secretly hate my spouse\" tone of a 1990s sitcom that could be tempting and so easy to lean on for cheap comedy points.\n\nNor has she shied away from her pride and admiration of his exploits, all while maintaining her status as an expert in the field and a great of the game.\n\nIt's a tightrope walk to be sure, but nothing to write home about for a woman who's been on high wires for two decades.\n\nThis article's author is not related to Alyssa Healy in any way.",

        "text": "The director of Adelaide Writers' Week (AWW) has resigned after days of furore regarding the decision to cancel a scheduled appearance by a Palestinian-Australian author.\n\nLouise Adler said the decision to cancel the appearance by Randa Abdel-Fattah was made by the Adelaide Festival board and came despite her \"strongest opposition\".\n\nSince Abdel-Fattah's appearance was cancelled, more than 180 participants have chosen to boycott Writers' Week \u2014 throwing the future of the event and the broader Adelaide Festival into doubt.\n\nIn an open letter published in The Guardian, Ms Adler said she could not be party to silencing writers.\n\nMs Adler, who is on the Jewish Council of Australia's advisory committee and is the daughter of Holocaust survivors, said Abdel-Fattah's appearance had been cancelled \"after pressure from pro-Israel lobbyists, bureaucrats and opportunistic politicians\".\n\n\"The increasingly extreme and repressive efforts of pro-Israel lobbyists to stifle even the mildest criticism has had a chilling effect on free speech and democratic institutions,\" she said.\n\nRanda Abdel-Fattah's appearance at Adelaide Writers' Week has been cancelled. (Supplied: Bendigo Writers Festival)\n\nAbdel-Fattah told ABC Radio Adelaide it was a \"tragedy\" that one of the most \"incredible directors and icons in Australia's cultural history\", Ms Adler, had felt she had to resign over the controversy.\n\n\"I think it's a tragedy it has come to this, it could easily have gone the other way,\" she said.\n\nOn Tuesday, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas reiterated his support for the board's decision to cancel the appearance, but said he did not have the power to direct the board.\n\n\"What Writers' Week does with this community is up to them. It's their event. Their decisions,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't speak for the board. I can't speak to the board.\"\n\nThe premier said he has not spoken with Ms Adler about Abdel-Fattah's inclusion on the AWW program.\n\n\"I have opened Writers' Week. I've stood up for Writers' Week, I've defended Louise Adler in the past,\" he said.\n\nAdelaide Writers' Week has faced a growing boycott. (Supplied: Adelaide Festival)\n\nMr Malinauskas has previously cited numerous anti-Israel and anti-Zionist social media posts by Abdel-Fattah in his support for the author's exclusion from AWW.\n\nThe ABC has contacted the SA government and the Adelaide Festival for responses.\n\nLast week, the board said while it was not suggesting Abdel-Fattah or her writing had any connection to the Bondi attack, based on her past statements, it would \"not be culturally sensitive\" to go ahead with her appearance at the festival, scheduled to begin on February 28.\n\nThe list of authors who have withdrawn from the event includes former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, Trent Dalton, Peter Greste, Hannah Kent and Evelyn Araluen.",

(ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nIndeed, the price of gold jumped to a record $US4,563.61 per ounce, as many sought the precious metal as a haven.\n\n\"Powell has had enough of the carping from the sidelines and is clearly going on the offensive,\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\n\"This open warfare between the Fed and the US administration \u2014 and to the extent that you take Powell's comments at face value \u2014 it's clearly not a good look for the US dollar.\"\n\nEx-Fed chair Yellen condemns probe\n\nThe news that one of their own has come under attack has drawn condemnation from former Fed chiefs.\n\nUS network CNBC reported that former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said the investigation compromised the central bank\u2019s independence.\n\nYellen reportedly added the news was \"extremely chilling\".\n\nReuters is also reporting the investigation was approved and started by Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington and an ally of Trump's\n\nPlaying with fire\n\nJerome Powell's term ends in May, after which a new Trump appointment will lead the US Federal Reserve.\n\nBut Powell is due to continue as head of the bank's interest rate-setting committee, the FOMC.\n\nSo this appears to be a particularly overt attempt by Trump to attack the institution itself and its ability to set monetary policy.\n\n\"President Trump's move appears to be a last-ditch effort to pressure Jay Powell not only to end his term as chair in May, but also to step down concurrently from the FOMC, despite that term not expiring until January 2028,\" Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said.\n\n\"Trump is playing with fire in his repeated attempts to pressure the Fed into cutting rates.\n\n\"It risks backfiring if it undermines market confidence in the independence of the US Federal Reserve and pushes long-term bond yields higher.\"\n\nDamaging the Fed's independence would push longer-term interest rates higher because bond investors would see US debt as riskier \u2014 the riskier the debt, the higher the cost or yield of it.\n\nLoading\n\nA significant increase in US longer-term interest rates would be a wrecking ball through the economy.\n\n\"After all, in the US it is long-term rates \u2014 not the Fed's control over short-term rates \u2014 that determine mortgage rates and most corporate borrowing costs,\" David Bassanese said.\n\n\"Rumours that President Trump may nominate his economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, as the next Fed chair will do little to reassure markets about the Fed's independence.\"\n\nA major US economic downturn, a plummeting US dollar and unpredictable US interest rates would create global financial chaos.\n\nThe Australian economy would not escape that extraordinary economic downdraft.",

[what] we\u2019re learning as we\u2019re going is that the Earth system and the climate system is really very complicated.\n\nWhen you start putting more energy into the atmosphere \u2026 the energy expresses itself in extraordinary ways. So we have, as we know, these extraordinary downpours and flooding events, we have these periods of just amazing rain.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing this as well in California. So you get these very wet periods, you get flooding. You can get an interaction of the flooding with burnt areas. And then before you know it, you can switch back to drought ... and then, to add insult to injury, we\u2019ve been getting these incredible windstorms, and windstorms go with wind-driven fires, and wind-driven fires are just the worst because they move so quickly.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size What\u2019s in a name? If you are the celebrated Professor Jagnoor Jagnoor, it adds up to a legacy of defying racist, religious and sexist stereotypes. A question about her name is one that Jagnoor, an epidemiologist and the head of injury prevention at the George Institute for Global Health, anticipates when we arrange lunch at Mediterranean-influenced restaurant St Siandra, near the Spit Bridge in Sydney. It is often the first thing others ask the global drowning prevention expert or quietly ask people who know her before they meet. Despite knowing Jagnoor for a decade while reporting on water safety, I have never questioned her about it. (Maybe it is because my full name is Julie Anne Julie Power, a weird family story.) Jagnoor\u2019s name was a snub to convention by her mother, Dr Manmeet Kaur, a health promotion educator. Called a tautonym, it is a bit like being called Thomas Thomas. Unusual for India, it was her mother\u2019s way of rejecting the practice of naming a child in a way that immediately pigeonholes religion and caste. \u201c[My mother] was progressive for her time,\u201d says Jagnoor, who moved to Australia more than 20 years ago to do a master\u2019s degree in public health (and ended up staying, marrying and having two children). Between delays caused by roadworks, Mosman Council\u2019s temperamental parking meters, the arrival of photographer Edwina Pickles, and me getting lost, it takes us time to settle into St Siandra and order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJagnoor chose the restaurant because it is near water, the foundation of civilisation, a source of joy to many, and sorrow to the families of the 300,000 around the world who fatally drown every year. She has been instrumental in reducing drowning rates in parts of the world where the equivalent of a kindy class of children aged one to five from the poorest of families fatally drowns every week. That compares with one kindy class a year in Australia. Jagnoor chose a restaurant near water, a source of life but also heartache. Credit: Edwina Pickles The fix? Jagnoor worked with local communities to establish small free creches that provide supervision and preschool education for children who live near ponds and other water bodies while their mothers work. It lifts all boats. Described by Jagnoor as the \u201cleast glamorous fix for the biggest ripple effect\u201d, these creches reduce the risk of drowning by more than 80 per cent, improve the employment of women, and kickstart the education of young children. But more on that later. To start with, Jagnoor recommends the flat bread, something she makes three times a day. \u201cFood is a love language,\u201d she says. Everything in her home is made with ginger and garlic, she confides, a precursor to a delightful discussion about the joys of Indian lime pickle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the potato flatbread with smoked garlic and some roasted cauliflower, both as good as she promised, Jagnoor sums up her backstory. An only child, she was born in Chandigarh in north-western India to two progressive academics in an era when India appeared to be embracing the Chinese one-child policy that also favoured boys over girls. Potato flatbread at St Siandra. Credit: Edwina Pickles If her parents had followed Sikh convention, her surname would\u2019ve been Kaur. \u201cMy mother thought: \u2018I have one child. I have a daughter, and I\u2019m not going to give her a surname. It represents your religion and your caste. And if you want to have equity in society, you don\u2019t want to have those hierarchies\u2019.\u201d \u201cShe always said, \u2018I never want you to be boxed in, I would like you to be a global citizen\u2019. \u201cYou were born a human,\u201d her mother told Jagnoor. \u201cWe all are, and then we are tagged and labelled in different ways. I would like you to die a human.\u201d \u201cI hold that dear to my heart,\u201d Jagnoor says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJagnoor \u2013 a vegetarian \u2013 orders the eggplant katsu, and I order the hanger skewers and a salad. We both drink tap water. When her main course arrives, I have FOMO. The eggplant is crunchy and crisp, and when she cracks it open, it oozes with creaminess. She gives me a taste. Then another. My skewers are good, but not quite as delicious. Over lunch and follow-up chats, Jagnoor talks about prejudice towards people with brown skin in global research, and a bias that results in academics from the Global North being deferred to and given first credit rather than local experts. The eggplant is crisp on the outside but creamy inside. Credit: Edwina Pickles As someone who lives in Castle Hill but was born in India, who works in Sydney (at the George Institute and UNSW) but travels to the subcontinent for work and family, Jagnoor sees herself as a kind of \u201cdouble agent\u201d able to navigate both worlds. Australia is home to more than 900,000 people born in India, the most recent census found, and Indians are one of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing population groups. Jagnoor, voted one of the 40 most influential Asian-Australians under 40 a few years ago, says they are underrepresented in leadership roles like hers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOriginally graduating as a dental surgeon in India, hearing an interview about an undertaker who worked in Delhi\u2019s slums changed her life. The undertaker said he had found a little girl cuddling her dead father\u2019s body, seeking warmth in Delhi\u2019s bitter winter. \u201cBecause there was no clothing, no blankets,\u201d Jagnoor explains. \u201cIt was that level of poverty and inequity in a city that has so much affluence.\u201d Raised to believe that health and education are great equalisers, she switched to studying a master\u2019s in public health at Sydney University, intending to devote herself to overcoming inequality. While undertaking a doctorate and coming across a chart relating to the so-called Million-Death Study, which identifies the causes of death in India, she found her calling. \u201cI realised that ... drowning is the leading cause of death for children aged one to three,\u201d she says. The chart that opened Jagnoor Jagnoor\u2019s eyes, showing the steep rise of children who died from drowning from one to five in India Credit: Jagnoor Jagnoor \u201cI was looking at a line diagram \u2013 I still have that figure right in front of my eyes \u2013 where on your X axis, you have your age groups, and you\u2019re looking at zero to one, one to two, etc. and you see this steep line going up. \u201cAnd you look at that variable, and the cause of death is drowning. That number, having that evidence, was definitely the triggering thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Not in media and definitely not in the toys that I played with. So to now be able to see myself in Barbie is mindblowing. And the impact that this is going to have on little girls is so exciting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doll is designed to reflect some of the ways neurodiverse people may experience the world, including articulated elbows and wrists to allow for stimming hand movements, a gaze that is slightly averted rather than making direct eye contact, and accessories linked to sensory processing and communication.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was developed with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network for its Fashionistas collection, which already includes dolls representing a wide range of skin tones, body types, medical conditions and disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor of Social and Development Psychology at Durham University in the UK, Monique Botha, believes it is an important move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of autistic children who will see a Barbie with ear defenders and an AAC device, which is a communication device, and absolutely be delighted. They will be delighted that there is a toy that might capture a bit of their experience, that they can see themselves in someone else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian developmental scientist and autistic mother, Doctor Kristyn Somners, says she won't be buying this toy for her children.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recently released a video on instagram explaining her concerns over the creation of a visual template for autism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the moment that exists, autistic kids, particularly girls will start to be compared to it. The second problem I see is that it creates a right way to be autistic. If your autism does not look like this, if you don't use an AAC, if you stim visibly, if you mask, this doll does not say that you're being included, it says you are not being autistic the right way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut autistic content creator Ellie Middleton says this doll reflects a broader shift in how autism is understood, moving away from traditionally masculine representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Up until very recently, autism was seen as something that was something that young white boys had and it was kind of especially a male thing. It was seen as something that was almost like one specific type rather than a spectrum. And I think we're starting to see the movement of society understanding that actually women can be autistic, people of colour can be autistic, adults can be autistic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile others have voiced concerns the Barbie could actually be enforcing stereotypes, rather than broadening inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Botha advises this - as with all representation - is not universal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There will also be an entire group of autistic people who don't particularly see themselves in this toy, who don't feel represented, and a toy cannot possibly represent everyone. Similarly, from other research, we know that children who play with ultra-thin dolls also, it affects how they see themselves and is related to an increased strive towards thinness itself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iconic doll is famous for embodying different professions and identities since her creation in the 1950s and this latest iteration comes as autism policy is being formed around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicole Rogerson is CEO of Autism Awareness Australia and a parent of an autistic adult.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile recognising the autistic community will have a range of opinions on this Barbie, she believes this isn't a reflection of meaningful progress in improving the lives of autistic people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It did make me honestly roll my eyes a little bit and say in the grand scheme of the challenges that the autism community has both nationally and internationally, you know a doll is not really going to do much here. It's really important for the autism community to be able to look at today and say look, great there is a doll. But let's get back to the serious work we need to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA year ago, Australia launched its first National Autism Strategy, a seven-year plan that dedicates more than $42 million in its first phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Rogerson says this is a time of stress and uncertainty for many families.\n\n\n\n",

She said she was unaware at the time of the scale or severity of the attacks.\n\n\n\nAbdel-Fattah has said she is considering her legal options in the wake of the board's decision, which she described as an \"obscene attempt\" to associate her with the Bondi Beach terror attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board has said it was not suggesting Abdel-Fattah or her work had any connection to the attack, but that proceeding with her appearance would \"not be culturally sensitive\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAdler, a former publisher and editor and the Jewish daughter of Holocaust survivors, has been a consistent defender of the right of Palestinians to speak freely.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was highly critical of the board's reasoning in her opinion piece.\n\n\n\nShe wrote the decision to dump Abdel-Fattah \"weakens freedom of speech and is the harbinger of a less free nation, where lobbying and political pressure determine who gets to speak and who doesn't\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe argued the decision reflected a wider pattern within Australian arts organisations, pointing to previous controversies involving the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Creative Australia and the collapse of the Bendigo Writers Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her view, boards with limited arts experience had been unnerved by political pressure and coordinated campaigns.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Writers pull out of Adelaide festival as dropped Palestinian author claims 'racist' treatment\n\nHer column echoed concerns raised by 17 prominent cultural figures \u2014 all former senior leaders of the Adelaide Festival \u2014 who wrote an open letter condemning the board's decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe signatories challenged the South Australian government to appoint people with arts expertise to the festival board, stating: \"We note there are currently none.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A former director of Adelaide Writers' Week says this year's beleaguered literary event is \"untenable\" as organisers admit they've received a \"significant\" community response to a decision to drop a Palestinian Australian author.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's no official word yet on whether the event will proceed without a majority of its scheduled speakers, who've announced they will no longer appear following the removal of author and academic Randa Abdel-Fattah from the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adelaide Festival board last week said Abdel-Fattah would no longer appear at Adelaide Writers' Week because it would not be \"culturally sensitive\" following the Bondi Beach terror attack referring to \"past statements\" she had made, which they did not specify.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News on Sunday reported that three board members, as well as the chair, resigned following a crisis meeting, after the number of authors cancelling their scheduled appearance reportedly hit close to 100.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Adelaide Festival spokesperson confirmed on Monday afternoon that former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern had also withdrawn from the festival, but did not provide details about when she withdrew or her reasons.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Board members, chair quit from Adelaide Festival as fallout from dropped author grows\n\nJo Dyer, who was director of Adelaide Writers' Week until 2022, said this year's event \u2014 due to start on 28 February \u2014 was \"untenable\" without 80 per cent of its scheduled writers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has virtually no writers left in its lineup,\" Dyer told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said it was a \"sad state of affairs\" to watch the festival turmoil amid the \"unprecedented\" turn of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's only been a few days that this crisis has engulfed the organisation,\" Dyer said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have heard of nothing, ever in the history of the festival which has undermined the international standing of the Adelaide Festival as much as the events of the last few days.\"\n\n\n\nIt's estimated around 80 writers have cancelled their appearance at the Adelaide Writers' Week event. Source: AAP / Joanna Kordina Dyer is among a group of former festival leaders who've written an open letter to call for Abdel-Fattah's reinstatement.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she didn't agree with the \"egregious incursion on the principle of freedom of artistic expression\" made by the board's decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People come to these events specifically to hear views with which they may not be familiar. Some of them are going to be uncomfortable. Some of them, people are going to disagree with, a bit mildly or vehemently,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But what writers forums like Writers' Week have shown is that if we are able to have these conversations in civilised ways.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this year's literary event in limbo, Julian Hobba, Adelaide Festival Corporation executive director, issued a statement on Monday saying: \"Following the Adelaide Festival Board's decision on Thursday 8 January and the significant community response, Adelaide Writers' Week and Adelaide Festival are navigating a complex and unprecedented moment and will share further updates as soon as we are able.\"\n\n\n\nConcerns after board resignations\n\nDyer has also raised questions over whether the board is still functional in its current composition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adelaide Festival Corporation Act 1998 stipulates the board must consist of a maximum of eight members, appointed by the governor, with at least two women and two men.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board currently consists of three women and one man \u2014 Leesa Chesser, Mary Couros, Brenton Cox, and Jennifer Fuller as the government observer.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Writers pull out of Adelaide festival as dropped Palestinian author claims 'racist' treatment\n\nDyer said the board appears to be no longer \"lawfully constituted\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very difficult for the organisation, generally, to operate without a functioning board. Quite apart from anything else, is that the board of directors are always very important around festival time,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said he's received advice on Sunday night the board is still formally, constitutionally capable of making decisions, and that the act didn't stipulate a minimum number of board members.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he had raised concerns about the reputational damage to the festival and the potential economic hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The people who run the festival which is the board as they should have got this into a pretty awful situation, which is unfortunate,\" he told reporters on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalinauskas has said he is prevented by law from directing the board. But last week, the premier said he had made \"it clear that the state government did not support the inclusion of Dr Abdel-Fattah\" in the festival program when asked for his opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the ABC on Monday, Dyer accused the premier of heaping \"unbearable pressure on the board to rescind the invitation to Dr Abdel-Fattah\", which she said was \"completely inappropriate\".\n\n\n\nWho is Randa Abdel-Fattah?\n\nAbdel-Fattah had been scheduled to appear at Writers' Week to discuss her new novel, Discipline, about an academic and journalist facing censorship, set against the backdrop of the 2021 Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is a lawyer, an award-winning author of multiple novels and an academic at the Department of Sociology at Macquarie University.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdel-Fattah is the daughter of Palestinian and Egyptian parents, and has been a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has previously faced criticism from the Coalition, as well as from some Jewish organisations and media outlets, over comments about Israel and Zionism, including an alleged post saying Zionists had \"no claim or right to cultural safety\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAn $870,000 Australian Research Council grant that Abdel-Fattah received to examine Arab and Muslim Australian social movements was suspended for almost a year amid an investigation into her expenditure and potential conflicts of interest. She was cleared of any wrongdoing and it was reinstated.\n\n\n\nLiberal senator Sarah Henderson said she commended the board's decision to remove the Palestinian Australian author, saying it was \"deeply disappointing\" she had been invited in the first place, saying the academic had posted an image of a Palestinian paratrooper on her Facebook page a day after the October 7 attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdel-Fattah confirmed she had posted an image of a person parachuting with a Palestinian flag in the wake of October 7 in an interview with the ABC on Monday afternoon, but said she was unaware at the time of the scale or severity of the attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the post was intended as a symbolic expression of besieged Palestinians \"breaking out of their prison\", and that she did not support the killing of civilians.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday morning, Abdel-Fattah told ABC radio her objections and critique of Zionism, a political ideology, were being conflated with antisemitism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have never, ever attacked Jewish people,\" she told ABC radio on Monday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am attacking a political ideology and the state which is carrying out a genocide against my people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA report last year by the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry \u2014 which does not speak on behalf of the world body and has faced harsh Israeli criticism \u2014 found that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has repeatedly denied is committing genocide in Gaza and rejected the report's findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdel-Fattah has labelled the board's decision to dump her from the event as \"extremely racist\" and an \"obscene attempt\" to associate her with the Bondi Beach terror attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is currently considering her legal options.\n\n\n\n",

I think everybody needs someone that pushes you to be better, to give your 100 per cent, and I think that's what we are doing every time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, we are, I believe everyone is different in a way, so, it's good for the sport to have different personalities and game styles, and it's great, you know, to share a court with him I see a completely different point of view, how to approach certain points.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld number four Novak Djokovic, who holds the record for most men's Australian Open titles at 10, will be looking to challenge the younger men to extend that achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Open is the first of the four major tennis tournaments held each year that make up the Grand Slam series, alongside the French Open in Paris, the Wimbledon Championships in London and the US Open in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt includes a range of match types, including men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles and doubles, as well as mixed doubles, junior championships, wheelchair, exhibition matches and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt $111.5 million, this year's prize pool is the largest in the tournament\u2019s history \u2014 a 16 per cent increase on 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opening week started on Monday 12 January, with hundreds of lower-ranked hopefuls competing in qualifying rounds to secure their spot in the main draw.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main draw will start on Sunday, 18 January and run for two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Madison Keys took home the women's Australian Open trophy - the 30-year-old's first Grand Slam win in her career.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American, now ranked ninth in the world, says tennis can be unpredictable but she's hoping to defend her title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously after you win a slam expectations go up. So, I think I've played the past year with higher expectations, but I think I'm really just trying to go out and start the year off as best as I can and play some really good tennis and I'm excited to see how all of the chips fall.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHot on the heels of the reigning champion is the world number one women's player Aryna Sabalenka who fell short in last year's final.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Russian has taken home the Brisbane International trophy earlier in the month and hopes to build off this momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah it's super special, I'm happy to hold this trophy. I'm happy to start season on a very strong note. Nobody knows what's what's gonna happen in the future but the only one thing I'm sure is that I'll be there, I'll be fighting. I'll do my best to to go as far as possible and do a little bit better than the last year and that's that's where my focus is. My focus is on my game, on developing myself and making sure that I'm strong and healthy heading to the AO.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld number four and reigning French Open champion, Coco Gauff, is also hoping she can start her season with a bang in Australia, with the American telling Channel Nine she's been training hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Last year I felt like I started off my season pretty strong. So, looking forward to hopefully doing the same thing. But you never know what to expect at the start of the year. You've been practising for a few weeks straight. So hopefully the things that I've been working on in practice can translate over.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother big name to watch out for this year is Polish player Iga \u015awi\u0105tek who won Wimbledon last year and is currently ranked world number two.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to local Australian Open hopes, there's none better than men's world number six player Alex de Minaur.\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Minaur has been in good form lately, recently defeating Poland's Hubert Hurkacz on home turf in Sydney in the United Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tells the Australian Open YouTube channel that he's planning on being a title threat this tournament after making it to the quarter finals last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would love nothing more than to have a deep run there and keep building upon what I've been doing the last couple years. And hopefully I'll be a threat for the title. That would be very very nice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRising star Maya Joint is another Australian to watch after the 19-year-old has had a phenomenal couple of years after entering 2024 ranked 684th in the world, but soaring to world number 32 by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint is guaranteed to be seeded for this year's Australian Open, meaning she won\u2019t face off against a higher-ranked player until at least the third round, giving her a great chance to have a lengthy run in the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther top 100 players representing Australia include women\u2019s singles players Daria Kasatkina and Alja Tomljanovic plus men Alexei Popyrin and Adam Walton.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / James Ross Players also compete to bolster their rankings on the official leaderboards, maintained by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for women and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for men.\n\n\n\nWhen is the Australian Open 2026?\n\nThe main draw for this year's AO will start on 18 January and run for two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nMen's and women's singles quarter-finals will take place on 27 January, with women's semifinals on 29 January and men's semifinals on 30 January.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe women's singles grand final will be held on 31 January, with the men's singles grand final the next evening, 1 February.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe men's and women's doubles finals will also be held over that weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're extra keen to get stuck in, good news \u2014 you don't have to wait for the main draw to kick off to see some great tennis.\n\n\n\nOpening week started on 12 January, with hundreds of hopefuls competing in qualifying rounds to secure their spot in the main draw.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers who have not automatically qualified for the main draw (through their global ranking) are required to win three matches to secure one of the 16 places available in each of the men's and women's singles draws.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the qualifiers, opening week also includes practice sessions each day that are open to the public, live concerts, and exhibition events like the One Point Slam \u2014 where world pros and amateurs alike will compete for a $1 million prize, with matches won by whoever gets a point first.\n\n\n\nWho will be competing in the Australian Open?\n\nThere's a strong mix of both established heavy-hitters vying for glory and newcomers hoping to make their mark on the tournament this year \u2014 both international stars and homegrown heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of the big names, Italian Jannik Sinner will be hoping to win his third consecutive AO (and fifth Grand Slam title), after coming out on top in the men's singles in 2024 and 2025 . He's currently ranked second, behind Spanish world number one Carlos Alcaraz \u2014 another player set to draw attention at this year's AO.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two players faced off in the finals of all three other Grand Slams last year \u2014 with Alcaraz winning the French Open and US Open, and Sinner winning Wimbledon in between.\n\n\n\nSpain's Carlos Alcaraz (left) and Italy's Jannik Sinner (right) each won two Grand Slam titles last year \u2014 with the other coming runner-up both times. Source: Getty / Matthew Stockman World number four Novak Djokovic, who holds the record for most men's AO titles at 10, will also be looking to extend that achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAO 2025 women's singles winner Madison Keys will also be hoping to defend her Australian crown at this year's event, after beating Belarusian world number one Aryna Sabalenka last year . Sabalenka is the most recent Grand Slam title winner, emerging victorious at the US Open last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther big names this year include Polish player Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, who won Wimbledon last year and is currently ranked world number two, and American player Coco Gauff, who took out first place in the French Open and is currently ranked world number three.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of local talent, rising Australian player Maya Joint is a clear one to watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19-year-old has had a phenomenal couple of years \u2014 entering 2024 ranked 684th in the world, soaring to world number 32 by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint will also benefit in this year's tournament from seeding \u2014 the process in which the top 32 players (as determined by world rankings) are arranged in the draw to ensure they don't play one another too early.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint is guaranteed to be seeded for this year's AO, meaning she won't face off against a higher-ranked player until at least the third round.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeding will be confirmed this week, with the official draw revealed on 15 January.\n\n\n\nAustralian player Maya Joint has enjoyed a rapid rise in recent years. Source: AAP / AP / Rick Rycroft World number six Alex de Minaur, Australia's top singles player, will also be a major draw, having reached the quarter-finals last year before being bested by eventual winner Sinner .\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Minaur has been in good form lately, recently defeating Poland's Hubert Hurkacz on home turf in Sydney during AO warm-up the United Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther players representing Australia this year that are worth keeping an eye on include women's singles players Daria Kasatkina and Ajla Tomljanovic, plus men Alexei Popyrin, Adam Walton, James Duckworth, Aleksander Vukic and Tristan Schoolkate. All are ranked within the top 100 of either the WTA or ATP.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Slam tennis is always full of twists, and it's worth keeping an eye on the smaller courts throughout the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Open is also no stranger to surprise upsets: last year, 19-year-old American qualifier Learner Tien knocked out Russian player Daniil Medvedev \u2014 then ranked world number five \u2014 in the second round.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS legend Venus Williams will play in this year's main draw, after receiving a wildcard slot. The 45-year-old has not played in Melbourne since 2021, and it will mark her first time playing outside the US since 2023.\n\n\n\nHow can I watch the Australian Open?\n\nThis year, Australians can watch the AO live and free via Channel 9 and its streaming platform 9Now. Stan Sport (which requires a paid subscription) will also have every match live and on demand.\n\n\n\n",

We have manufacturing plants opening up at a level nobody has ever seen before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government in total is committing around 28 billion dollars to fund a series of measures to support the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Shadow Resources Minister Susan McDonald told Sky News she is concerned domestic policy will impede Australia's international plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have been warning for years that Labor needs to ensuring the supply of these critical minerals and that means insuring mining. That means not introducing more legislation like the EPB. It means reducing the costs of processing. You know, if we just talk about gallium for a second. I mean, that is a by product of bauxite mining and yet, bauxite processing is on its knees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of Australia's critical minerals have been processed in China, which controlled close to 90 per cent of the resource's global supply chain last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat reliance is shared by other advanced economies, with finance ministers from G7 nations in Washington D-C to discuss the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will be there to spruik Australia's place on the critical minerals supply chain - and potential to disrupt China's monopoly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the resources minister, it signals Australia's place on the global stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What this says is that whilst Australia is not a member of the G-7, because of our extraordinary resources sector and natural advantages in resources and critical minerals we are welcome at these forums as a leader in rare earths and critical minerals globally.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "United States Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says the justice department has served the central bank with subpoenas and threatened criminal indictment over his testimony about the Fed's building renovations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move represents a major escalation in US President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as quickly as Trump prefers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subpoena relates to his testimony before the senate banking committee in June, Powell said, regarding the Fed's US$2.5 billion ($3.7 billion) renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump criticised as excessive.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell cast off what has up to this point been a restrained approach to Trump's criticisms and personal insults, which he has mostly ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, on the weekend, he issued a video statement in which he bluntly characterised the threat of criminal charges as simple \"pretexts\" to undermine the Fed's independence when it comes to setting interest rates.\n\n\n\nPowell said: \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a sharp departure from the Fed's understated response to Trump so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe central bank has tried to placate the administration by dialling back some policies, such as efforts to consider the impact of climate change on the banking system, that the administration clearly opposed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his June testimony, Powell disputed some of the criticisms levelled against the Fed's renovation of two historic office buildings, which have ballooned in cost.\n\n\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe justice department in a statement said it can't comment on any particular case, but added attorney general Pam Bondi \"has instructed her US attorneys to prioritise investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the subpoenas, Powell becomes the latest perceived adversary of the president to face a criminal investigation by the Trump administration's justice department.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump himself has urged prosecutions of his political opponents, obliterating institutional guardrails for a justice department that for generations has taken care to make investigative and prosecutorial decisions independent of the White House.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What would the fallout be if Donald Trump tries to fire the Federal Reserve chief?\n\nThe potential indictment has already drawn concern from one Republican senator, who said he'll oppose any future nominee to the central bank, including any replacement for Powell, until \"this legal matter is fully resolved\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" said North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, who sits on the banking committee, which oversees Fed nominations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.\"\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share A A A\n\nConsumer tsar Gina Cass-Gottlieb has sounded a warning over the proliferation of artificial intelligence systems in online retail, saying bots deployed by rival businesses could collude to fix prices. Speaking to this masthead, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair highlighted the risks of AI \u201cagents\u201d or bots, which will be a key focus for the watchdog this year. AI-powered bots can act on behalf of consumers, but there is a risk they are tricked into higher-cost deals. Michael Howard As well as highlighting the risk of cartel conduct by AI-powered bots, Cass Gottlieb also warned of AI\u2019s potential to \u201csupercharge\u201d scams, and an emerging trend among companies of overplaying the extent to which machine learning actually features in their software or products to justify charging consumers more, in a practice dubbed \u201cAI washing\u201d. Cass-Gottlieb said a key concern for the regulator in 2026 would be the rise of AI agents, which have risen in prominence over the past year as tech companies race to release more sophisticated models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificially intelligent bot \u201cagents\u201d can act on behalf of a user to search for products, compare prices and execute transactions based on previously gathered information on their needs and preferences. Related Article AI Would you let a bot choose your insurance for you? Equally, AI agents can be used by companies to tailor marketing to specific consumers, as well as conduct other business such as sourcing products and dealing with suppliers. Multi-agent systems, where several AI agents work together on a shared goal, are increasingly used by businesses to boost efficiency. Cass-Gottlieb said that AI agents could also collude with each other to fix prices, meaning that consumers comparing prices might be misled into accepting prices that aren\u2019t the cheapest. Even AI agents acting on behalf of a shopper could be fooled into such purchases. Her warning comes as an ACCC research paper found that while AI agents had the potential to help shoppers and firms, \u201cas businesses increasingly incorporate AI agents, agent-to-agent communications and dealings will become more commonplace\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI\u2019s ability to learn from a customer\u2019s personal data means it can manipulate their preferences and the purchasing decisions of an AI agent they\u2019ve deployed, more effectively than traditional nudges, the ACCC has found. ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the rise of AI-powered bots raised the risk of cartel conduct. Edwina Pickles Even without an AI agent acting for a consumer, AI agents deployed by businesses can use personal data to tailor marketing to an individual\u2019s real-time consumer behaviour such as their emotional vulnerabilities, something that would amount to a \u201chypernudge\u201d in pressuring them into a sale. In terms of cartel conduct, while some businesses could instruct algorithms to price fix deliberately, the ACCC has warned the widespread use of AI agents by businesses could give rise to the risk of AI agents \u201clearning to collude with one another, even when collusion is not intended by their developers or operators\u201d. It referenced research that \u201ccompetitors using the same AI agent may end up exchanging competitive pricing information, without knowing or intending to do so\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, Cass-Gottlieb said \u201cthere are some pretty serious risks for cartel conduct. \u201cThere have already been some cases internationally looking at algorithmic collusion, so looking at the problem of anti-competitive conduct and once you ask the question whether AI systems are intelligent enough to work out that it is in the interests of the people deploying them to co-ordinate their conduct,\u201d Cass-Gottlieb said. Related Article Food On gelato and in coffee: Australian olive oil\u2019s health-led boom She referenced a recent matter in the United States where the Department of Justice reached a settlement with a real estate platform over allegations an algorithmic rent-setting software allegedly allowed landlords to compete less and boost prices they charged tenants. \u201cThere is manifestly a capacity for this to be done at an incredibly sophisticated level, informed by highly up-to-date data with very rapid analysis using AI,\u201d Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn such cases of algorithmic collusion, the ACCC has noted businesses \u201cmay lead to corporations disputing their liability for the outputs or actions\u201d of their agents. However, a Treasury review of AI and consumer law in October found that existing laws were suitable. Cass-Gottlieb said it was important for laws to keep pace with the development of AI technology to ensure Australians weren\u2019t worse off in the end. \u201cThe hope is that it\u2019s a net positive, that it enables better informed consumers \u2026 (but) the fear is that it enhances the capacity to do these sorts of negative (methods)\u201c. Increasingly sophisticated AI-image, voice and website generation is also a prime concern for the ACCC. Fake reviews are another issue Cass-Gottlieb expects to grow worse with AI\u2019s proliferation, due to its ability to generate convincing reviews. It also means that ghost stores are easier to set up, she said. These are websites purporting to be the online presence for local bricks-and-mortar small businesses running closing down sales but which don\u2019t actually exist and instead \u201cdrop-ship\u201d poor quality products from overseas. \u201cIt can supercharge scams, so that the messages that we receive just appear so much more believable because they\u2019re targeted to us in a more effective and believable way, even before you ask about AI voice replication,\u201d Cass-Gottlieb said.

The specifics of the deal are still unclear, with a brief joint statement from the two companies saying only that the next generation of Apple AI models will be based on Google technology, but will continue to use Apple\u2019s \u201cPrivate Cloud Compute\u201d architecture. The statement was published on Google\u2019s blog. Apple\u2019s iPhones will soon be powered by new AI features built on Google tech. The announcement comes after years of pressure from analysts and investors for Apple to plug a perceived AI gap, with the company drip-feeding elements of its \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d suite and delaying its new Siri while competitors raced ahead with experimental generative AI. The development is obviously a win for Google, and for Wall Street\u2019s AI hype-pushers. Parent company Alphabet briefly broke above a $US4 trillion ($5.9 trillion) market capitalisation on Tuesday as shares rose 1.7 per cent following the announcement, making it the second-largest firm after Nvidia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nAI Does Apple really need to become an AI company? Tim Biggs Consumer Technology Writer Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the move was what the Street had been waiting for, \u201ca stepping stone to accelerate [Apple] AI strategy into 2026 and beyond\u201d. The deal could be a threat to Samsung, which also leans heavily on Google AI to differentiate its phones from Apple\u2019s, and to OpenAI which wants its ChatGPT to find a home on iPhones. But what will the development mean for consumers? On the one hand, the tech industry\u2019s enthusiasm for AI is far greater than the average phone user\u2019s need for more generative features. An OPPO Australia survey published in October found only four per cent of respondents thought AI was an important factor in choosing a phone. Behind the scenes, AI can positively affect smartphone elements people actually care about \u2013 improving battery life, maximising storage space, powering computational photography \u2013 but the more language-focused or creative elements explicitly marketed as AI have received a lukewarm welcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe buzziest of Gemini capabilities, including real-time voice conversations and image generation, have proven to be hit-and-miss, while the chatbot itself continues to struggle when it comes to serving reliable and verified information without invention or confusion (and Gemini is not alone in this).

If it uses Google\u2019s raw resources to create responsible features, the iPhone could become a superior overall platform for AI. If consumers consider the major issues with these features to be around privacy, utility and seamless integration, Apple is ideally positioned to deliver an experience that\u2019s preferable to what is currently found on Pixel and Galaxy phones. However, the iPhone-maker also has other challenges ahead of it. It appears determined to deliver the more personal, more context-aware AI Siri it originally promised years ago, but it needs to find a way to avoid the problem Gemini and ChatGPT have with lying and overconfidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple also runs platforms favoured by the creative industry, and will likely want to avoid the perception that its technology is based on art that Google has scraped and repurposed behind creators\u2019 backs. The final piece of the puzzle will be price. Consumers currently pay Apple subscription money for tangible benefits including cloud storage and premium news content, but will the company charge for high-end AI like Google and OpenAI do? Perhaps unsurprisingly, analysts view that as inevitable. \u201cThis was a necessary move for Apple to deliver its own personal assistant within its hardware ecosystem, while expecting to deliver a new subscription-based revenue stream to the largest consumer installed base in the world,\u201d Ives said.

If you are the celebrated Professor Jagnoor Jagnoor, it adds up to a legacy of defying racist, religious and sexist stereotypes. A question about her name is one that Jagnoor, an epidemiologist and the head of injury prevention at the George Institute for Global Health, anticipates when we arrange lunch at Mediterranean-influenced restaurant St Siandra, near the Spit Bridge in Sydney. It is often the first thing others ask the global drowning prevention expert or quietly ask people who know her before they meet. Despite knowing Jagnoor for a decade while reporting on water safety, I have never questioned her about it. (Maybe it is because my full name is Julie Anne Julie Power, a weird family story.) Jagnoor\u2019s name was a snub to convention by her mother, Dr Manmeet Kaur, a health promotion educator. Called a tautonym, it is a bit like being called Thomas Thomas. Unusual for India, it was her mother\u2019s way of rejecting the practice of naming a child in a way that immediately pigeonholes religion and caste. \u201c[My mother] was progressive for her time,\u201d says Jagnoor, who moved to Australia more than 20 years ago to do a master\u2019s degree in public health (and ended up staying, marrying and having two children). Between delays caused by roadworks, Mosman Council\u2019s temperamental parking meters, the arrival of photographer Edwina Pickles, and me getting lost, it takes us time to settle into St Siandra and order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJagnoor chose the restaurant because it is near water, the foundation of civilisation, a source of joy to many, and sorrow to the families of the 300,000 around the world who fatally drown every year. She has been instrumental in reducing drowning rates in parts of the world where the equivalent of a kindy class of children aged one to five from the poorest of families fatally drowns every week. That compares with one kindy class a year in Australia. Jagnoor chose a restaurant near water, a source of life but also heartache. Edwina Pickles The fix? Jagnoor worked with local communities to establish small free creches that provide supervision and preschool education for children who live near ponds and other water bodies while their mothers work. It lifts all boats. Described by Jagnoor as the \u201cleast glamorous fix for the biggest ripple effect\u201d, these creches reduce the risk of drowning by more than 80 per cent, improve the employment of women, and kickstart the education of young children. But more on that later. To start with, Jagnoor recommends the flat bread, something she makes three times a day. \u201cFood is a love language,\u201d she says. Everything in her home is made with ginger and garlic, she confides, a precursor to a delightful discussion about the joys of Indian lime pickle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the potato flatbread with smoked garlic and some roasted cauliflower, both as good as she promised, Jagnoor sums up her backstory. An only child, she was born in Chandigarh in north-western India to two progressive academics in an era when India appeared to be embracing the Chinese one-child policy that also favoured boys over girls. Potato flatbread at St Siandra. Edwina Pickles If her parents had followed Sikh convention, her surname would\u2019ve been Kaur. \u201cMy mother thought: \u2018I have one child. I have a daughter, and I\u2019m not going to give her a surname. It represents your religion and your caste. And if you want to have equity in society, you don\u2019t want to have those hierarchies\u2019.\u201d \u201cShe always said, \u2018I never want you to be boxed in, I would like you to be a global citizen\u2019. \u201cYou were born a human,\u201d her mother told Jagnoor. \u201cWe all are, and then we are tagged and labelled in different ways. I would like you to die a human.\u201d \u201cI hold that dear to my heart,\u201d Jagnoor says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJagnoor \u2013 a vegetarian \u2013 orders the eggplant katsu, and I order the hanger skewers and a salad. We both drink tap water. When her main course arrives, I have FOMO. The eggplant is crunchy and crisp, and when she cracks it open, it oozes with creaminess. She gives me a taste. Then another. My skewers are good, but not quite as delicious. Over lunch and follow-up chats, Jagnoor talks about prejudice towards people with brown skin in global research, and a bias that results in academics from the Global North being deferred to and given first credit rather than local experts. The eggplant is crisp on the outside but creamy inside. Edwina Pickles As someone who lives in Castle Hill but was born in India, who works in Sydney (at the George Institute and UNSW) but travels to the subcontinent for work and family, Jagnoor sees herself as a kind of \u201cdouble agent\u201d able to navigate both worlds. Australia is home to more than 900,000 people born in India, the most recent census found, and Indians are one of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing population groups. Jagnoor, voted one of the 40 most influential Asian-Australians under 40 a few years ago, says they are underrepresented in leadership roles like hers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOriginally graduating as a dental surgeon in India, hearing an interview about an undertaker who worked in Delhi\u2019s slums changed her life. The undertaker said he had found a little girl cuddling her dead father\u2019s body, seeking warmth in Delhi\u2019s bitter winter. \u201cBecause there was no clothing, no blankets,\u201d Jagnoor explains. \u201cIt was that level of poverty and inequity in a city that has so much affluence.\u201d Raised to believe that health and education are great equalisers, she switched to studying a master\u2019s in public health at Sydney University, intending to devote herself to overcoming inequality. While undertaking a doctorate and coming across a chart relating to the so-called Million-Death Study, which identifies the causes of death in India, she found her calling. \u201cI realised that ... drowning is the leading cause of death for children aged one to three,\u201d she says. The chart that opened Jagnoor Jagnoor\u2019s eyes, showing the steep rise of children who died from drowning from one to five in India Jagnoor Jagnoor \u201cI was looking at a line diagram \u2013 I still have that figure right in front of my eyes \u2013 where on your X axis, you have your age groups, and you\u2019re looking at zero to one, one to two, etc. and you see this steep line going up. \u201cAnd you look at that variable, and the cause of death is drowning. That number, having that evidence, was definitely the triggering thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Rozlyn de Bussey worked on the QVB in her early 20s. Since then, she has worked full time as a glass artist. Alex Ellinghausen Now the city is staring down a proposal from retailers who want to replace the QVB\u2019s coloured glass on the ground floor on Market Street with clear glass, which greatly \u201csaddened\u201d de Bussey. From 1985 to 1987, de Bussey and her fellow apprentices embarked on a labour-intensive refurbishment process, cutting more than 73,000 pieces of glass \u201cfrom morning until night\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInternal, external, we cut every bit of glass in the QVB,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was tedious and laborious. We were beginners, but good beginners. You\u2019re working fast, you\u2019re diligent in what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019re getting the work done efficiently.\u201d They worked offsite at a Pyrmont factory, using templates and patterns of varying sizes to guide their work before the glass was transported and installed at the QVB. There were no traces of any blueprints for the centre panel in this QVB arch, so artists had to come up with a new design. James Brickwood \u201cPrecision is everything,\u201d according to de Bussey. \u201cIf you\u2019re a millimetre off at the bottom of a building, you\u2019re going to be 100 millimetres off at the top.\u201d Some of her fondest memories as a young glass artist were forged during her two-year stint working on the QVB. Even after more than 30 years, she feels prouder than ever for the opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Heritage \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u2019: Retailers want to scrap the QVB\u2019s stained-glass windows She said any retailer \u201cshould be proud to be in the building\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s vital to actually keep what\u2019s there and appreciate it. Even to replace it with modern glass today, it would probably cost a lot more than what it did,\u201d de Bussey said. And it isn\u2019t the first time there has been a push for change. In 1959, the QVB faced complete demolition when then-lord mayor of Sydney Harry Jensen announced plans to replace the building with a civic square and car park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it was saved, the building remained idle as debate over its fate swirled for decades before it was classified by the National Trust in 1974. Lord Mayor Clover Moore was on the council committee that approved the restoration in the 1980s, and said the QVB was one of her favourite buildings in Sydney. These stained-glass windows outside Market St could be replaced with clear ones if a development application is waved through. Louie Douvis \u201cThe Queen Victoria Building is an icon, and one of our most important heritage buildings in the City,\u201d Moore said. \u201cToday the QVB stands in all her glory, testimony to the original vision for the building and the superb craftsmanship of the artisans who put it all back together again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho else was part of the glass restoration efforts? Standing underneath the QVB\u2019s vast central dome that is 19 metres wide and 58 metres tall, it is difficult to imagine how one person could have painted all the glass \u2013 but that was precisely what glass artist Rodney Marshall did. Rodney Marshall painted the QVB\u2019s central dome, which spans 19 metres. James Brickwood Rodney Marshall was one of the glass painters behind the 1980s refurbishment of the QVB. James Brickwood Marshall and his business partner Steve Taylor won a competitive tender process, and in 1985 were tasked with the mammoth effort to restore and repaint almost every glass panel in the building, with the help of apprentices such as de Bussey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get the job, there were a few people quoting. We were very excited about the whole thing,\u201d Marshall said. Rodney Marshall working on the QVB in the 1980s. Shockwaves from the nearby 1978 Hilton Hotel bombing caused extensive damage to the QVB and presented the pair with further challenges, but together they meticulously combed through council archives, library records, architect designs, and even the Herald\u2019s own archives to piece together accurate blueprints of the original glass. When he could not find any design traces for one of the main windows, Marshall opted to paint the panels with original designs instead. The process also involved removing the windows, measuring them, cutting glass with templates, painting the panels, kiln firing, coating the glass with putty, and then reinforcing it with steel bars for added strength.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a huge job, with long hours and some days that ended at 9 or 10pm. But it was a wonderful thing to work on \u2013 there was no doubt about it,\u201d the 84-year-old said. Working with glass was an extremely tedious and meticulous process, Marshall said. And while Marshall\u2019s intricate glass windows aren\u2019t the ones on the chopping block \u2013 the ones that could be scrapped were glazed by a different company \u2013 he is adamant that nothing of heritage significance should be removed from the QVB.

Got it Share A A A\n\nDiscussing finances and investing is close to taboo in most families, but that\u2019s not the case for grandmother Vicki Price. Instead, she actively encourages it. Having spent more than 30 years investing, the 76-year-old has made it her mission to openly discuss which investments and asset classes have worked \u2013 and importantly, which haven\u2019t \u2013 with the women in her family. For many families, discussing money can feel awkward or taboo. Dominic Lorrimer Price has overseen her own share portfolio on behalf of herself and her husband since she was in her late 50s, so she feels well-equipped to drive the family conversations. While she admits it was a case of trial and error in those early days, she\u2019s since learned the benefit of leaving investments time to mature, and how to research companies she wants to invest in over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVicki Price, 76, has made it her mission to educate her family about investing. \u201cI\u2019m the one that pushes things along after a bit of research, sharing what I\u2019ve learned with my two daughters, my granddaughter and my sister,\u201d Price says. For years, family group chats and get-togethers have quickly turned to the topic of who has been investing in what, and what the returns have been like. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about me giving advice, but more about sharing what each of us are investing in, and what returns we\u2019re achieving.\u201d Price started investing out of necessity in the beginning, hoping she could build her retirement savings. \u201cWhen we reached our early 50s, we didn\u2019t have much saved as we had been raising kids, so I was looking to build the nest egg.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrice started out with a CommSec portfolio, but now uses Stockspot to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Others in her family invest in silver, property and shares. Over the years, her investment portfolio has experienced steady growth. Price says her husband doesn\u2019t have much interest in investing, so leaves her to make the decisions. \u201cI always do my homework, researching all the big investment companies and looked at their returns, and I could see you were just a small cog in a big wheel, and I didn\u2019t like that.\u201d Over the next decade, women are expected to inherit and control approximately 65 per cent of the nearly $5 trillion set to change hands in the largest intergenerational wealth transfer on record. This will see women become the primary decision-makers for family budgets and wealth creation. So, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that a growing number of women are turning to investing, now accounting for 42 per cent of investors with active holdings \u2013 up 18 per cent over the past three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite ongoing efforts to close the gender gap, women still trail men in finances. The average Australian woman has $428,000 in net wealth, compared to $597,000 for men \u2013 a 40 per cent gap. This comes down to factors such as lower workforce participation, the gender pay gap and more time spent out of the workforce raising children, along with superannuation disparities.
