        "text": "The maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the US as Britain's struggling auto industry begins to respond to the 25 per cent tax on vehicle imports imposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nJaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain\u2019s biggest carmakers, said the pause would take place this month.\n\n\u201cThe USA is an important market for JLR\u2019s luxury brands,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.\u201d\n\nJaguar Land Rover is pausing shipments of its cars to the US as it assesses Donald Trump's tariffs. (CNN)\n\nAnalysts said they expect other British carmakers to follow suit as the increased tariffs heap more pressure on an industry that is already struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cI expect similar stoppages from other producers as firms take stock of what is unfolding,\u201d said David Bailey, an automotive industry expert and professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham.\n\nThe number of cars made in the UK dropped 13.9 per cent to 779,584 vehicles last year, according to the SMMT. More than 77 per cent of those vehicles were destined for the export market. UK factories export cars such as Nissan's Qashqai and Juke, BMW Mini, and Toyota Corolla, as well as Land Rover and Jaguar models.\n\nREAD MORE\ufeff\n\nRange Rover sports utility vehicles in the paint shop at the company's manufacturing plant in Solihull, UK.

SMMT figures show that exports to the US jumped 38.5 per cent from a year earlier in December, 12.4 per cent in January and 34.6 per cent in February.\n\n\"This was manufacturers like JLR trying to get ahead of the game in terms of getting inventory to the U.S. before the tariffs were implemented,'' Bailey said.\n\nBritish carmakers shipped 8.3 billion pounds ($17.5 billion) worth of vehicles to the US in the 12 months through September, making cars the single biggest goods export to the US, according to government statistics.\n\nBut cars make up a relatively small part of overall trade between Britain and the U.S., which is heavily weighted toward services.",

        "text": "It's worth watching.\n\nWith everything that's happening in the world, where is Australia's sovereign wealth fund (the Future Fund) investing on behalf of Australians?\n\nIt recently released its six monthly investment update.\n\nThe update shows what stocks it bought and sold between June and December, and what returns its stock holdings are generating.\n\nInvestments in weapons manufacturers and aerospace companies\n\nWe've previously written about the controversy surrounding a list of 30 \"defence companies\" the Future Fund has direct shareholdings in (i.e. global weapons manufacturers and aerospace companies).\n\nYou can see the original list here.\n\nLet's revisit that list to see how the Future Fund's investments in those stocks are going (according to its Periodic Investment Report 31 December 2024).\n\nFuture Fund's investments were always politicised Photo shows An aerial view of coal extracted from the Narrabri mine, with a landscape of lakes and mountains behind it. The federal government has been accused of politicising the Future Fund by changing its mandate, but its investments have always been tangled up in politics.\n\nThe latest data show that, between June and December, the value the fund's shareholdings in the companies on that list jumped by $94 million.\n\nThe value of its shareholdings increased significantly in Axon Enterprise Inc. (+132.5 per cent), Elbit Systems (+102 per cent), Lockheed Martin (+52.5 per cent) and Thales (+41.98 per cent).\n\nThe value of its shareholdings in Northrop Grumman (+33.4 per cent), the Boeing Co. (+26.6 per cent), and RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon Technologies) (+13.9 per cent) also rose noticeably.\n\nMany of those companies are the subject of international divestment campaigns.\n\nThe table below shows the value of the fund's shareholdings in those companies.\n\nIn the table, a change in the value of the shareholdings reflects the Future Fund's decision to buy (or sell) more of each stock, an increase (or decrease) in the price of each stock, or both.\n\nNorway's sovereign wealth fund has many of those companies on its exclusions list for things like human rights violations, production of nuclear weapons, and particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms.\n\nHowever, there's currently a debate in Norway about the wisdom or otherwise of maintaining such strict ethical guidelines for its sovereign wealth fund in today's environment, when the global security landscape is evolving rapidly and defence spending is rising.\n\nJust last month, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned these were \"momentous and dangerous\" times and Europe was now living in \"an era of rearmament\".\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nWith that in mind, another Future Fund investment worth watching is Palantir Technologies.\n\nBetween June and December, the value of the fund's shareholdings in Palantir increased from $5.5 million to $20 million (+263 per cent).\n\nThe company's share price jumped by 192 per cent in those six months, and the Future Fund bought more stock, increasing its shares from 144,897 to 163,479.\n\nWhat does Palantir do?\n\nWhat does the supermarket chain Coles and the CIA have in common? Photo shows Office workers walk past a Coles supermarket. Coles plans to deploy data company Palantir's tools across more than 840 supermarkets to cut costs and \"redefine how we think about our workforce\". At a time of increased food insecurity, Australians should question if this is the right direction.\n\nIt sits on the frontier of Big Data analytics (it was named after the seeing stones in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings).\n\nEarly in its life, it received seed funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm, and much of its revenue derives from government clients such as military, immigration departments, and police agencies, in the United States and overseas.\n\nIt has been the subject of a slew of books about Silicon Valley's billionaires and the deep connection between modern national security and the surveillance state.\n\nIts artificial intelligence software has helped US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials conduct workplace raids, family separations and deportations.\n\nIt's the subject of international divestment campaigns due to its \"strategic partnership\" with Israel's military.\n\nIt also works with large companies such as Rio Tinto, WesTrac, and Coles supermarkets (it has offices in Canberra and Sydney).\n\nThe US billionaire Alex Karp, chief executive and co-founder of the company, published a book in February titled: The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the West.\n\nIt's currently ranked No.1 on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nIn the book, Mr Karp argues \"the West\" is superior and software and technology companies must forge a deeper bond with the state to help the West maintain its geopolitical and economic dominance this century.\n\nNorway's sovereign wealth fund recently took a huge $US1.4 billion position in Palantir (significantly increasing its stake in the company).\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nTesla and BYD shares\n\nThe Future Fund also piled into Tesla stocks in the second half of last year.\n\nIts purchases roughly coincided with the election of US President Donald Trump in November.\n\nTesla sales slump in US Photo shows Elon Musk stands infront of the smashed windows of a Cybertruck Elon Musk's electric vehicle company has also been targeted by vandals in recent months amid backlash to his embrace of far-right politics.\n\nBetween June and December, the value of the Future Fund's Tesla shareholdings jumped from $159.2 million to $472.7 million (+196 per cent).\n\nThat's nearly half a billion dollars.\n\nTesla's share price jumped by 104 per cent in those six months, and the Future Fund increased its shareholdings by 34.8 per cent (from 537,358 to 724,704 shares).\n\nBut we'll have to see what happens to those shareholdings when the Future Fund releases its next six-monthly investment update.\n\nTesla shares have plummeted 40 per cent in value this year, due partly to the global backlash against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk.\n\nBYD takes on Tesla with ultra-fast EV chargers Photo shows People stand around a car with all its doors open with a sign in beg letters on the wall behind reading BYD. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has unveiled its ultra-fast charger that promises to take just five minutes to fully power EVs \u2014 putting heat on rival Tesla in the process.\n\nInterestingly, the Future Fund also owns shares in Tesla's rival, the Chinese car maker BYD, but its shareholdings in BYD are small in comparison.\n\nAnd the fortunes of BYD are tracking in the opposite direction of Tesla's right now.\n\nBYD generated $170 billion in revenue in 2024 (soaring past Tesla's annual revenue of $155.5 billion).\n\nIt reported a 73 per cent surge in net profit to a record $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter last year, and its share price is up 32 per cent this year.\n\nBetween June and December, the value of the Future Fund's BYD shareholdings rose from $10.6 million to $17.9 million (+69 per cent), and it bought 88,900 more shares.",

Pretty angry and mad,\" McCormick told the tour's social media channels.\n\n\"So I figured I've tried a lot of things, and I just figured I'd shut myself up. So I put tape over my mouth.\"\n\nDid it work?\n\nNot judged on his score. After opening with a 1-over 73, he posted a 72 in the second round and missed the cut.\n\nMcCormick, who had a year on the PGA Tour in 2024, said he tried other methods of improving his game, such as reading books and talking to people.\n\nBut nothing seems to work for the 33-year-old, who turned professional in 2014.\n\nMcCormick missed the cut in Savannah after reaching 36 holes on 1-over. (Getty Images: Mogie Adamchik)\n\n\"I've run out of ideas, and I thought about the tape thing a couple of weeks ago,\" McCormick said.\n\n\"So just unfortunately it came down to that today. I was hoping maybe it would help me. Can't say that it did or didn't.\"\n\nOne reason for the extraordinary move was McCormick said he did not want to create a negative experience for his playing partners.\n\n\"Having a tough time, and that was my solution today,\" he said.\n\nAP",

An Aboriginal community in far west New South Wales works through grief for lost loved ones with a hands-on project using the art of mosaic.\n\nMr Parsons enrolled in a four-week course at TAFE NSW teaching people concreting skills to make headstones.\n\nHe has learnt how to make his own moulds, place and pour concrete, cure it and finish the surface.\n\nHe was also taught how to finish the base of the headstone so that the image sticks out from the surface like braille.\n\n\"By everyone doing their own design, it's telling their own stories,\" Mr Parsons said.\n\nMr Parsons is making a memorial that represents his father's life. (ABC Central West: Toby Hemmings)\n\nTAFE NSW head teacher of construction trades Mark Penman said the idea for the course came about when he noticed how many unmarked graves there were in rural or remote cemeteries across the region.\n\n\"Best case scenario, there was a little white timber cross on the grave but due to weather events, these are destroyed or eroded over time,\" Mr Penman said.\n\n\" The costs of buying a headstone are really high and out of reach for people in these communities. \"\n\nCowra cemetery has a number of graves without a permanent memorial. (ABC Central West: Toby Hemmings)\n\nHonouring a life\n\nThe course has been held in western New South Wales communities such as Collarenabri, Lightning Ridge and Brewarrina, and most of the participants have been Aboriginal people.\n\nAt the latest session, held recently in Cowra, students spent a day at the local cemetery to get a sense of how many graves lacked a permanent monument.\n\nDella Williams and her sister were among the 15 participants and were making headstones for their parents, who died more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"We lost count of how many graves need [a headstone]. Quite a few up there,\" Ms Williams said.\n\nShe said the cost of buying a headstone could range from several hundred to several thousand dollars and that meant the more permanent memorials had previously been beyond the budget of many grieving families.\n\n\"The community can't afford these things, so we can go out and make it ourselves. It works out easier for us.\n\n\"We can continue on with this, make some more for the rest of the community that really needs it.\n\n\"We made our own crosses but the rain damages that, so these will be more secure.\"\n\nIndenting butterflies into the corners is a way of personalising the tombstone. (ABC Central West: Toby Hemmings)\n\nCareer potential\n\nParticipants in the course also receive their white card upon completion, potentially unlocking a further career in the local construction industry.\n\nThe induction certificate recognises individuals who have completed the safety training needed to work on construction sites.\n\nMr Penman said the nature of the course appealed to people who might never have considered vocational training before.\n\nStudents can personalise and style the headstones they make however they like. (Supplied: Hayden Ellis)\n\n\"It can be extremely sensitive and personal to people,\" he said.\n\n\"Having that buy-in and really hoping to have a quality finished product at the end of it really provides motivation.\n\n\"To think that this could also be a pathway into a full qualification would also be a great outcome.\"\n\nSo far, the course has been run in communities across the north and far west of the state, and there are plans to head to Lake Cargelligo later this year.\n\nIn Cowra, the Local Aboriginal Land Council intends to continue to make headstones for the community after the course is finished.",

This usually works perfectly, being the start or middle of Queensland school holidays, except for this year.\n\nIn 2025 it falls on the final weekend of school holidays in both Queensland and Victoria, a move that's been dubbed \"a bit strange\" by some tourism providers and parents alike.\n\nABC Lifestyle Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nIn New South Wales, the ACT, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, the Easter long weekend will be part-way through their school holidays.\n\nWhile kids in the Northern Territory will already be back in the classroom before Easter after a one-week break.\n\nSo why do school holidays differ in states and territories? And what challenges does it create?\n\nWhy school holidays aren't the same\n\nEach state and territory education department is responsible for its holidays \"because they're all responsible for their own education\", according to Dr Rebecca English.\n\nShe's a former teacher and education researcher at the Queensland University of Technology on Turrbal and Yugara lands.\n\nDr Rebecca English is a lecturer at QUT and a former teacher. (Supplied)\n\n\"The curriculum (except for NSW who do their own thing) is set at national level through the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority,\" she says.\n\n\"But each state is responsible, through various mechanisms, for implementing the curriculum.\n\n\"So, they can modify and alter things \u2026 and holidays seem to be a natural extension of that.\"\n\nWe asked each state and territory education department how they decide the dates for school terms and holidays.\n\nThere were some commonalities.\n\nThey all set the dates three to five years in advance.\n\nThey all consult with other sectors, such as Catholic education, independent schools and, where possible, other Australian jurisdictions.\n\nAnd they try to have consistent term lengths and examination periods each year.\n\nIn Queensland, term dates are set approximately three years ahead.\n\n\"To help schools, school communities, and the public with long-term planning,\" an Education Queensland spokesperson says.\n\n\"Each element is carefully considered to ensure a well-structured and balanced school calendar.\"\n\nThe general pattern is 190-200 school days per year for government schools. (ABC News: Steve Keen )\n\nThe South Australia Department for Education told us that setting holiday dates takes in a number of considerations.\n\n\"Such as, 40 weeks of instruction time for the year, divided into four terms of equal length, with two weeks of holiday between them,\" a spokesperson says.\n\n\"The Easter holiday period is normally taken into account, depending on where it falls.\n\n\"The Christmas holiday extends until the first non-public holiday after Australia Day, if possible.\"\n\nThe number of working days for teachers also needs to be consistent with the relevant industrial agreements, which may be different for each state or territory.\n\nWhile there is a general pattern of 190-200 school days per year for government schools, public holidays create their own localised interruptions.\n\n\"The other issue, of course, is with different public holidays in different states,\" Dr English says.\n\n\"I think all of it depends on so many different factors and each state and territory would be in the same boat.\"\n\nPrivate school holidays different again\n\nPaul Kidson, a senior lecturer in educational leadership, Australian Catholic University, says there is the added complexity of private and independent school holidays, which can also differ within states and territories.\n\n\"In the early days of these schools, they needed an earlier finishing date so rural students could return home.\n\n\"And the tradition has stuck.\"\n\nHow do mismatched school holidays affect your family, friendships and travel? We'd love to hear. Email lifestyle@abc.net.au\n\nSeasonal factors when determining holidays\n\nWhere you live in Australia can also have an impact on the length of school holidays.\n\nThe Northern Territory has a longer mid-year break (three weeks) during the northern dry season to allow Territorians to take advantage of milder weather conditions.\n\nChairman of Queensland Tourism Industry Council Shane O'Reilly says having the Easter long weekend at the end of the school holidays is strange.

Sam Cardone hasn't had a problem taking her children on short trips during the school term. She says they're better off for the experience.\n\n\" So, it's better when it's sort of near the beginning or in the middle at least but having it right at the very end is a bit strange. \"\n\nThe New South Wales education department told us that the timing of Easter \"should not determine the end of Term 1 vacation\".\n\n\"If Easter falls outside the school vacation period, it should be observed as a separate four-day holiday,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nIf you're like me and your kids will miss a bit of school after Easter for holidays or to visit family and friends, Dr English says not to worry.\n\n\"They will learn so much more from being away with their family on holidays,\" she says.\n\n\"You all are doing important stuff like building relationships, negotiating where you're going to go, working together as a family.\"",

Reducing that income stream will mean less support for Australian students, fewer research breakthroughs and fewer opportunities to grow the skills our economy needs.\"\n\nInternational students blamed for rental crisis\n\nThe opposition leader told reporters at a housing development on Melbourne's outskirts that it was necessary to reduce the number of international students coming into the country to free up homes for young Australians.\n\n\"When you look at the price of the cost of rents over the last couple of years, they've skyrocketed under this government,\" he said.\n\nMore uncertainty on the cards for international students Photo shows A man in graduation outfit.

That's really our main priority here.\"\n\nA University of South Australia study this year found there was no link between the number of international students and the cost of rent.\n\nMr Sheehy, from Universities Australia, warned against making international students scapegoats for the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cStudents make up less than 6 per cent of the national rental market.

(Simon Frazer: ABC News)\n\nAt some point after Mr Cotton's complaint was received, McMahon was removed from the role of parish priest \u2014 someone who is responsible for a particular location and celebrates mass in that parish regularly.\n\nBut he was never stopped from practising as a priest altogether.\n\nHe became a relief priest, filling in when other priests were on holidays or ill.\n\n\"That continued pretty much through the years until his death in 2012. Parishioners were not informed as to his history,\" Mr Cotton said.\n\n\" To let him into parishes in they way they did was mind-bogglingly bad and stupid practice. \"\n\nAllegations from the 1950-1990s\n\nMcMahon was moved around various Christian Brothers schools in Western Australia and South Australia before he returned to his home state of Tasmania to become a priest.\n\nLawyer Judy Courtin's firm represents 10 McMahon victim-survivors.\n\nJudy Courtin says McMahon's victims could number in the hundreds. (ABC News: Peter Healy)\n\n\"McMahon was raping and sexually assaulting children over a period of 35 to 40 years. He started in Tasmania in the 50s, when he was still training to be a Christian Brother,\" Dr Courtin said.\n\n\"He was still raping and sexually assaulting children in the 90s when he returned to Tasmania.\"\n\nShe said he was moved every one to two years while he was a Christian Brother.\n\nDr Courtin estimated there could be 200 or more victims of McMahon, \"because we know that only about 5 per cent of boys who are sexually assaulted by Catholic clergy will ever report to the police\".\n\n'Abuse allowed to continue'\n\nA West Australian parliamentary committee heard evidence about McMahon as part of its inquiry into the options available to survivors of institutional child sexual abuse in WA who are seeking justice.\n\nIn its report from 2023, the Community Development and Justice Standing Committee said it understood McMahon \"abused children at every school he attended\".\n\n\"Despite knowledge of the abuse by at least the 1990s, Father McMahon's abuse was allowed to continue,\" the report said.\n\nThe committee also said it received evidence that \"the Archdiocese [of Hobart] allowed Father McMahon to continue as an active priest until his death in 2012\".\n\nA Western Australian parliamentary inquiry said it understood McMahon had \"abused children at every school he attended\". (ABC News: Loretta Lohberger)\n\nIt said \"credible evidence\" from Mr Cotton included that 24 men had come forward alleging assault by McMahon, \"including one from Tasmania when he was a priest\".\n\nThe committee also received evidence that the Christian Brothers had been paying compensation to victims of McMahon \"since at least the early 2000s\".\n\nThe Trustees of the Christian Brothers made a compensation payment to Mr Cotton in 2019 for the abuse he experienced while a student at Aquinas College.\n\nPeter Cotton made a successful claim for compensation for abuse he experienced as a child. (Supplied: Peter Cotton)\n\n'They run the risk of this all happening again'\n\nMr Cotton said while his contact with the Archdiocese of Hobart through his research had been \"cordial and professional\" he was concerned the archdiocese \"don't seem to have learnt from the experience of McMahon\".\n\n\"The Archdiocese of Hobart should own up to this situation. If they're not prepared to look into it seriously and make some admissions, they run the risk of this all happening again,\" he said.\n\n\"There should be a judicial inquiry looking into the way they dealt with my complaint and the complaints that followed, and what they did about McMahon, and how they used him, continued to use him as a [relief] priest despite these credible claims against him,\" he said.\n\nMr Cotton said he would also like to see the archdiocese publish a notice about McMahon that would invite others to come forward to make a complaint or seek support.\n\nPeter Cotton would like to see a judicial inquiry set up to look at how the Archdiocese of Hobart dealt with his complaint, and the complaints that followed. (ABC News: Matthew Holmes)\n\nNo comment from archbishops\n\nThe ABC asked the Archdiocese of Hobart for interviews with both Archbishop Doyle and the current Archbishop of Hobart, Julian Porteous, and gave an outline of what the interviews would cover.\n\nA spokesperson declined both interviews, saying:\n\n\" For reasons of confidentiality the Archdiocese of Hobart does not publicly comment on individual matters. \"\n\nThe ABC then went back to the archdiocese with specific questions for both archbishops, which included how the McMahon matter was handled at the time and what, if anything, had been learnt from it.\n\nNeither archbishop responded to any of the questions.\n\nLeah Bromfield says transparency is \"really, really important\" for victim-survivors of child sexual abuse. (Supplied: Australian Centre for Child Protection)\n\nThe director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection at the University of South Australia, Professor Leah Bromfield, said it was \"so important\" that institutions acknowledge and be transparent about their past mistakes.\n\n\"For victim-survivors that's about being seen, that's about an organisation demonstrating that they actually learned and that children in the future will be safer,\" Dr Bromfield said.\n\nDr Bromfield said institutions needed to do more than say sorry, they needed to \"act sorry\".\n\n\"And part of acting sorry when it comes to child sexual abuse is acknowledging your past, is being transparent,\" she said.\n\nThe WA parliamentary inquiry also wrote of the importance of transparency:\n\n\"Institutions that maintain an unholy wall of silence can only be doing so as a strategy to limit their financial liability rather than providing just outcomes for victim/survivors. Transparency would be a game-changer,\" its report said.",

        "text": "Read the story in Chinese\n\nWith a looming federal election, it's no surprise the major parties are paying close attention to the Chinese-Australian vote.\n\nAt the last election, the swing against the Liberals in electorates with a high concentration of Chinese Australians was almost twice that of other seats.\n\nAs polling day approaches, there's one part of the nation attracting particular attention.\n\nFor the first time this year, the Menzies electorate in Victoria has the most Chinese-Australian voters, followed by the neighbouring seat of Chisholm, after electoral boundaries were redrawn.\n\nThe redistribution shifted most of the suburb of Box Hill, which has a high Chinese-Australian population, from Chisholm into Menzies.\n\n\"There is this idea that whatever happens in outer eastern Melbourne dictates what happens to the whole country,\" said Jill Sheppard, a political scientist from the Australian National University.\n\nDr Sheppard said the redistribution made both seats more marginal and puts more of \"a national spotlight\" on the electorates.\n\nIn light of the changes, the ABC visited Menzies and Chisholm to find out what issues Chinese-Australian voters care about.\n\nCost of living key issue\n\nLinda Bekesi says cost of living and the quality of childcare are some issues she is most concerned about. (ABC News: Lachlan Bennett)\n\nChinese-Australian Linda Bekesi \u2014 who has lived in Box Hill South for five years \u2014 was in the Chisholm electorate but thanks to the redistribution is now a first-time voter in Menzies.\n\nDespite being in a new electorate, the issues Mrs Bekesi cares about haven't changed.\n\nThe mother-of-two cited the cost of living, the cost and quality of childcare, and security \u2014 including protection of personal data \u2014 as things that matter to her the most.\n\nInstead of short-term fixes, Mrs Bekesi wants the government to come up with a long-term plan to address the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"We've been having this cost-of-living crisis for some time now, so it's not really getting resolved in my view,\" she said.\n\nMrs Beksei, who spoke with the ABC for this story before Four Corners revealed failures and systemic issues in Australia's childcare sector, said she was not happy with the quality of the care her child had received.\n\nShe's pulled her child out of one centre because it \"wasn't a good fit\" and wants childcare practices across the board to be reviewed.\n\n\"So that they're actually meeting the needs of our children \u2026 not just working for the bottom profit line,\" she explained.\n\nVoters 'care deeply' about Australia-China relations\n\nRui Gu lives in Chisholm and wants Australia to have a good relationship with China. (ABC News: Kai Feng)\n\nIn more than 15 interviews the ABC did with voters in Menzies and Chisholm, the cost of living, housing affordability and community safety were raised as key issues.\n\nWhile Chinese Australians were also concerned about education, health and aged care, Sino-Australia relations was also a significant issue for voters, said Luxin Liu, a Chinese-Australian community political commentator.\n\n\"Many first-generation migrants also care deeply about Australia's relationship with China,\" Dr Liu said.\n\nSuch is the case for Rui Gu, who migrated to Australia from China 30 years ago and lives in Chisholm.\n\n\"For a lot of Chinese Australians, Australia is our second home, but China was our motherland, so we'd like to see Australia and China develop a friendship,\" said Mr Gu.\n\nLiu Luxin says the major parties are being careful with messaging to Chinese-Australian voters. (Supplied)\n\nMr Gu said if the bilateral relationship was good, it benefited Chinese Australians who work in business, education, tourism and trade sectors here.\n\n\"There's an old Chinese saying \u2014 being harmonious but maintaining differences,\" he said.\n\n\"Politics shouldn't get in the way of trade. We shouldn't shut the doors to business just because of political differences.\"\n\nDr Liu said both major parties were being more careful this time around with messaging to Chinese-Australian voters after the 2022 federal election results.\n\nJill Sheppard says Chinese-Australian voters may not take the parties on face value. (Supplied)\n\nIn the last election, in the top 15 seats with Chinese-Australian voters, the swing on a two-party-preferred basis was 6.6 per cent toward Labor, compared to 3.7 per cent in other seats, Liberal Party analysis found.\n\n\"I think it is really important to remember just how willing Chinese-Australian voters are to punish candidates in governments that they don't feel are talking to them,\" Dr Sheppard said.\n\n\"What's a particular challenge with Chinese-Australian voters is that they're not willing necessarily to take the parties on face value.\"\n\nRedistribution could impact results\n\nAlbanese and Dutton shake hands at LNY celebration in Box Hill. (Supplied: ABAW)\n\nIt's a point not lost on Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton, who both visited Box Hill during Lunar New Year celebration events at the beginning of the year.\n\nShaking hands and smiling for local Chinese media, both leaders promised more financial support to the community's cultural events.\n\nLiberal MP Keith Wolahan won the seat of Menzies with a 0.7 per cent margin at the 2022 election, but because of the redistribution Menzies is now a notional Labor seat, according to ABC election analyst Antony Green.\n\nOne in four voters in Menzies are new to the electorate, Mr Wolahan said.\n\n\"The challenge for incumbents like me is that, although we like to think we've worked hard over three years, for a quarter of the electorate, they don't know you,\" he said.\n\nAustralian politicians take to Chinese social media Photo shows Collage of Australian politicians on Red. Of Red's 150 million active users, almost 700,000 are based in Australia. That presents both opportunities and risks for Australian politicians.\n\nGabriel Ng is the Labor candidate for Menzies, and it's his first tilt at politics.\n\n\"I think with any first-time candidate, there are some nerves, but I'm being well supported,\" he said.\n\nIn Chisholm, the redistribution has improved the Liberals' chance of defeating Labor, predicted Antony Green.\n\nBut Labor incumbent Carina Garland isn't paying too much attention to pre-election number crunching.\n\n\"If the analysts were all correct last time, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you as the member for Chisholm, yet here we are,\" Ms Garland said.\n\nLiberals' candidate for Chisholm, Katie Allen, said there has been \"a change in mood\" in Chisholm.\n\n\"The question is just how much,\" Dr Allen said.\n\nRead the story in Chinese: \u9605\u8bfb\u4e2d\u6587\u7248",

Newly minted doctor Noah Szto brings together music, comedy and PowerPoint to offer a skew-eyed look into the realities of what it takes to pursue a career in medicine. Med School is at ACMI until April 20. Credit: Ian Laidlaw While Szto does not shy away from getting into the weeds of his particular experiences, he does a deft job of navigating both the specific and the broad. If you are or know someone who is in the medical field, there are enough \u201cin\u201d jokes to make you feel catered to, but not so many to be alienating to everyone else. Yes, this is a show all about medicine and med school, in particular \u2013 Szto performs the whole thing in scrubs (and, yes, there is a minor medical procedure as promised). At the same time, if you\u2019ve never set foot in a hospital, the running themes \u2013 art v science, prestige over precarity, loss of identity, and being worn down by an institution \u2013 extend far beyond the medical field. If you\u2019ve ever had to make the sensible choice over following your passions, the core of this show taps into that complex web of feelings, jazzes it up with a song, a dance and a laugh, and offers up a glimmer of hope.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Elizabeth Flux\n\nFrankie McNair and Isaac Haigh | The Booth Variety Spectacular & Formal Apology Hour!\n\nArts Centre Melbourne \u2013 Members Lounge, until April 20 Tabitha Booth (a resplendent Frankie McNair in character) has been on air for 12 years \u2013 you may know her as the Long-Forked Lady. But as she inauspiciously turns 40, she\u2019s being Substance-ed by young upstart Isaac Haigh. What antics can we expect from our favourite emotionally dysregulated silver-screen siren in her final show as host? The Booth Variety Spectacular & Formal Apology Hour! is on at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. As soon as you step into the Member\u2019s Lounge, you\u2019re immediately transported into the frenzied hubbub of a live-studio audience. This immersive veracity is maintained throughout \u2013 audience members are handed cue cards, the lights go up between the filming of zany segments, and we become privy to the unravelling of both Tabitha and the show as the night progresses. This meticulous attention to detail is mirrored in the set, costumes, ensemble cast and variety show ephemera. Perennially shimmying, McNair has perfected performing a woman perpetually on the brink, while Haigh is impeccable as her smooth, supercilious co-host-turned-interloper. Alice Tovey is our guest comedian of the night and although her contemporary references disrupt the old-world feel of 1969, it\u2019s a solid set. The funniest moments transpire within the many immaculately constructed layers of the show: the action unfolding behind Tabitha as she demurs about turning 40, the televised close-ups of remonstrations, the uproarious ad breaks, and the disconnect between what\u2019s seen to be happening and what\u2019s actually happening in the thrilling denouement.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nLou Wall | Breaking the Fifth Wall\n\nComedy Republic, until April 20 The zeitgeist rumbles through every MICF. This year, it\u2019s all about AI, conspiracy theories, truthism and bald-faced lies. Breaking The Fifth Wall is on until April 20. Lou Wall has built an entire show around telling porkies for laughs. Even though we\u2019re told this upfront, the various betrayals, twists and turns that unfold as the hour progresses land perfectly every time. Wall is from the iPad Kid generation of comics for whom multimedia is always close at hand. This forms part of the elaborate set-up as we whiz through PowerPoints, Facebook Messenger recaps, deepfakes and Wall dialling into tense FaceTimes with themself. It\u2019s an amped-up, maxed-out variety hour with a compelling meta-narrative, incorporating games, comedy tunes, sneaky sleight of hand and even some slam poetry. Wall is so relaxed and natural in every guise they inhabit, it\u2019s no wonder we are putty in their hands.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nGuy Montgomery | I\u2019ve noticed so many things, It\u2019d be unfair to keep them to myself\n\nAthenaeum Theatre, until April 20 Will he or won\u2019t he? This question (no spoilers as to why) will run through your mind regularly during the offbeat ponderings of Guy Montgomery, who by his own admission is staying in much nicer accommodation since the roaring success of his television panel game show Guy Montgomery\u2019s Guy Mont-Spelling Bee. I\u2019ve Noticed So Many Things, It\u2019d Be Unfair To Keep Them To Myself is on until April 20. Self-deprecating as he warms up the crowd, the show launches with aplomb. On this night, he seems genuinely stunned that \u2013 when asked \u2013 a bloke in the front row publicly shares his actual email address. Montgomery\u2019s artful play on words, his over-arching smarts and congeniality is lapped up. Thoughts on water temperature, real estate agents and zoos are riotous. It feels like the room is hanging on his every syllable. Each quip is met with laughter. It\u2019s a delightful ride. And ultimately, the burning question that repeatedly surfaces gets answered.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nEmma Holland | Don\u2019t Touch My Trinkets\n\nACMI, until April 20 Art lover Emma Holland\u2019s origin story begins with being told off for touching the iconic Capitoline Wolf statue in Rome. Denied this contact, she embarks on a life where she will have unfettered access by making her own, which she displays here for us (but no touching). Don\u2019t Touch My Trinkets is at ACMI until April 20. Credit: Your Local Film Lab Don\u2019t Touch My Trinkets artfully combines physical comedy, props, audience engagement and PowerPoint presentation. Holland has many strings to her comedy bow and plays them to perfection, eliciting delighted laughter from the audience. She works the crowd with ease, using direct eye contact and the smallest of gestures to draw the whole room in. As Holland ends the show, she raises questions about her own relationship to art, creativity and audience. What ethical quandaries does it bring up? Have we become complicit in her weaponising the art form of comedy? It\u2019s an interesting question that Holland ultimately leaves hanging, instead opting for an ending with more laughs.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nAnisa Nandaula | You Can\u2019t Say That\n\nThe Victoria Hotel, until April 20 Anisa Nandaula is disarmingly charming, luring you in with her warmth and candour onstage. She shares how she acclimatised to Australian culture after migrating from Uganda, growing up in blaringly white cities in Queensland. You Can\u2019t Say That is at the Victoria Hotel until April 20. Nandaula\u2019s approach is conversational, from asking audience members casual questions, like their vocation, to more probing ones, such as if they\u2019ve ever cut anyone out of their lives, eliciting interesting responses. For those unnerved by the limelight, she gives them latitude to rebuff her advances by responding with a \u201cbye b\u2014\u201d. This generates an air of comfort, with one attendee chiming in on Nandaula\u2019s enquiry about culturally diverse friendship groups: \u201cThere\u2019s black people in Thornbury!\u201d Her set starts off a little awkwardly as she occasionally falters her delivery and doesn\u2019t quite land the punchlines. When she eventually hits her groove, she\u2019s unstoppable, playing out scenarios with a bombastic side-eye and confident strut. If you\u2019re seeking a comedic act that will keep you at ease, Nandaula should be your pick.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nLizzy Hoo | Deja Hoo\n\nThe Victoria Hotel \u2013 Banquet Room, until April 20 If you weighed Lizzy Hoo\u2019s likeability, you\u2019d break the scales. In a testament to her skills, she\u2019s racked up a multitude of television credits \u2013 including her 2023 Amazon Prime Video comedy special, Hoo cares!? \u2013 since her stand-up debut in 2017. Deja Hoo is on at The Victoria Hotel until April 20. Credit: Chris Hillary Confidently, she poses the question \u201care you ready for the best night of your life?\u201d before embarking on a fun showcase of witticisms, celebrating her Chinese-Malaysian Irish-Australian heritage. There\u2019s a slew of absorbing stories about dating, brotherly bullying, the joys of living solo and the perfect gift selection for a mother. The audience chuckles along. A line about greyhounds is blooming hilarious. It\u2019s not a Lizzy Hoo show without a tale about dad, Chan Hoo, she says \u2013 admitting a quick call to her brother furnishes her with yet another delightful story to share.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nHarry Jun | Friendship Safari\n\nThe Greek \u2013 Apollo, until April 20 Most classic stand-up falls into one of three categories: contrarian edgelord, trauma spiller, affable friend. Luckily, Harry Jun belongs to the latter, and that might just be the whole point of his show. Friendship Safari is at The Greek until April 20. While Friendship Safari is ostensibly about friendship and its complexities, Jun moves swiftly onto other subjects. There are snippets from a previous life as a schoolteacher \u2013 among other life stories \u2013 with some bemusing curveballs. His past wrangling dead-eyed teen children turns out to be a skill set transferable to bringing high energy to a quiet night. The night I go, only three people are in the audience. Yet, Jun takes it on the chin and delivers the show nonetheless with aplomb, although his brio gives way to a glimmer of defeat at the very end. If every comedian\u2019s got a schtick, Jun\u2019s is trivia. There\u2019s a sense of watching an earnest friend regale you with their learnings and seeing how much fun they have doing it. In a world of chaos and irony, Jun\u2019s sincerity charms.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan\n\nSuren Jayemanne | There\u2019s A World Where My Head Ought To Be\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 There\u2019s a World Where My Head Ought Be is at the Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. Suren Jayemanne used to sell himself as the guy who gave up accounting to do comedy, but is now turning over a new leaf. When someone else called him an artist, he saw himself as one for the first time. He\u2019s a smart comedian and unafraid to raise the stakes. Jayemanne is also having somewhat of an identity crisis provoked by getting a new photograph for his license. It\u2019s worse than you think. In his photo, he\u2019s a white woman. His time waiting at VicRoads has Jayemanne considering the divine within ourselves, and he thinks we should all be considering it, too. It\u2019s the kind of smart comedy brave enough to bring big questions into the room and rely on the gravity of the story to bring the humour. The result is a satisfying show with something to say.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nAlanah Parkin | Garage Sale\n\nDouble Tree by Hilton, until April 6 Allow yourself to be transported to Narre Warren South (39 kilometres south-east of Melbourne) for Alanah Parkin\u2019s debut solo show, where older couple Denise and Greg are downsizing \u2013 hence, holding a garage sale. Garage Sale is at DoubleTree by Hilton until April 6. Among the sale items strewn across the stage are hats, scarves, doilies and a video porn collection. A wonderfully unpredictable, somewhat chaotic, 50 minutes of escalating comedy-drama ensues, presented by a variety of lively, absurd characters. Grandma is a hoot. A litany of giggles follows as the audience is invited to participate in a Jane Fonda-esque workout routine. Video and voiceover vignettes allow Parkin to dart backstage for necessary costume changes, giving rise to amusing moments. Clearly gifted, Parkin revels in gloriously ridiculous scenarios (picture a poetry-reciting rag-doll or a self-help guide for aged-out choir boys) in a quirky show that takes a rather unexpected turn.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nPierre Novellie | Must We?\n\nThe Westin, until April 18 It\u2019s easy to warm to this giant Millennial good boy in a baby-blue suit. His crisp delivery and Attenborough-esque enthusiasm might not endear him to the more blokey comedy crowd, but anyone at the Douglas Adams end of the humour spectrum will find themselves in good hands here. Must We? is at The Westin until April 18. He\u2019s a detail guy: an impromptu bit of audience banter has him noting that our shrinking chocolate teddy bear snacks are due to illegal gold mining in Ghana. His brain carries a lot that way. The show\u2019s first third is likeable if not groundbreaking guy-with-a-mic bizzo, but the remainder is tighter and generates those barks of recognition that fine observational comedy evokes. The show sticks the landing, too, with a quietly insistent reminder that stand-up, like society, must be a broad church if its members are to survive. (And for the blokes: denim condoms.)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by John Bailey\n\nAlex Ward | Clip Clop Don\u2019t Stop\n\nSwiss Club, until April 20 Do you have pretty privilege? You probably don\u2019t know if you do, according to how the theory goes. Alex Ward is convinced she has something similar: pretty approachable. That\u2019s where you have a face that welcomes everyone and anyone to strike up conversation, ask you for directions or assume you work here \u2026 wherever here happens to be. Clip Clop Don\u2019t Stop is at the Swiss Club until April 20. Being approachable has led to some entertaining situations, which Ward easily wins over her audience by telling us about. This show is filled with likeable banter and quick jokes. Mostly the target of her humour is herself, making her material all the more approachable. It\u2019s relatable humour to go with her relatable face. This is a neatly structured show which takes satisfying sidetracks, entertaining diversions and clever callbacks. The audience keeps up a steady rate of laughter throughout. It takes skill to make it look this easy, which Ward does.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nZo\u00eb Coombs Marr | The Splash Zone\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr is a master of meta. Her fast-paced comedy can be variously subversive, confoundingly circular and wildly clever. The Splash Zone is a light-hearted offering \u2013 and about as straight up and down as Marr gets. The Splash Zone is at the Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. Credit: Christa Holka We hear of growing up in Grafton, in northern NSW, life-defining moments that arrive while waiting for a train, Aussies abroad and Americans Down Under, and Trump-loving patrons who seem a bit lost. References to ADHD and audience distractions collide with commentary on social fragmentation, conspiracy theories and the growing disconnect between thoughts and facts. As a whole, the show relies too much on said audience distractions and cultural references. Some of the punchlines are predictably daggy, but the fans lap them up. While Marr\u2019s award-winning character, Dave, skewered gendered structures in comedy to perfection almost a decade ago, a sidebar here about nasty male comedians misses the mark at a festival that has made increasing efforts to celebrate diversity in recent years. It\u2019s early in the run, but Marr\u2019s latest offering feels somewhat disjointed itself. Then again, perhaps that\u2019s the point.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nAmy Gledhill | Make Me Look Fit On The Poster\n\nThe Westin, until April 5 We\u2019re barely two minutes into Amy Gledhill\u2019s show and the audience is already swinging underwear in the air. Make Me Look Fit On The Poster is at The Westin until April 5. Just to be clear, no one was actually undressing \u2013 but having a show start with strangers handling mysterious undergarments certainly loosens a crowd up. This is what Gledhill\u2019s stand-up is all about \u2013 stripping down to crack up. Fresh off the back of her award-winning Edinburgh Fringe Festival run, she shares personal tales like she\u2019s chatting with a best friend. We learn about her experiences of \u201ccursed\u201d oral sex, and the time she mistook Stranger Things\u2019 Finn Wolfhard for a \u201clittle tiny orphan boy\u201d. Sprinkled in between the gags, she confides in us about her admittedly low self-esteem and warped body image.\n\nLoading Granted, not every yarn sticks the landing \u2013 a three-minute spiel about how much toilet paper she accumulates fizzles hard \u2013 and some of her references are too British to translate to an Australian crowd. But what she lacks in knee-slapping punchlines, she makes up for in both physical comedy (her re-enactment of dangling from a tree like a \u201clittle ginger bauble\u201d was chef\u2019s kiss) and genuine relatability. Maintaining knicker-swinging energy for an hour is no easy feat, but Gledhill gives it a fair crack.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets Flo & Joan starring George Fouracres | One Man Musical\n\nArts Centre Melbourne - Fairfax Studio, until April 20 Comedic duo Flo & Joan have built a show around the idea that nothing brings people together like hating Andrew Lloyd Webber. They\u2019re back this year with a 60-minute, high-energy tour of the man they describe as a legendary \u201ccockroach of the West End\u201d. Or, for legal reasons, a purely farcical one-man show about a random cat-loving narcissist who loves organ-heavy riffs and hating Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nThe show was a runaway hit at Edinburgh Fringe last year. Part-swansong, part-musical biopic, Flo & Joan fill the show to the brim with biographical details and melodic parodies of Webber\u2019s classic style. Meanwhile, actor George Fouracres plays a short-tempered and entitled Webber, sitting on a throne dressed in purple velvet as he swings from the self-obsessed showstopper, All About Me, to nostalgic ballads mourning his glory days. One Man Musical is on at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. Moments that parodied Webber stood out over those that simply recounted his life. One scene, backed by bubble machines and technicolour lighting, married creative pastiche and biography spectacularly. But the show ultimately struggles to make the leap from Fringe venue to the Arts Centre\u2019s Fairfax Studio. Loading Muted sound design left Fouracres out in the cold, making his high-octane delivery style seem overzealous and his high-pitched vocals like an attempt to overcompensate by yelling. It\u2019s a bit grating. But for that reason, maybe One Man Musical has perfectly captured what it might be like to spend an hour with this living legend \u2013 for better or for worse.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed Guy Webster\n\nJude Perl Tries To Finish A Sentence\n\nArts Centre Melbourne \u2013 The Show Room, until April 20 As the title of this show suggests, Jude Perl finds herself unable to say anything that doesn\u2019t upset someone and is hyper focused on using \u201ccorrect\u201d language when expressing herself. Hence, why she can\u2019t finish a sentence unless she\u2019s belting out tunes on her piano. Jude Perl Tries To Finish A Sentence is at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. There\u2019s something interesting to be said about the age of moral outrage we\u2019re currently in and the polarised views that rest on either end of the spectrum. But Perl\u2019s prevaricating show veers perilously close to embracing moral ambiguity at a time when crusades are being waged against \u201cwokeism\u201d and clear-eyed renunciations of injustice are being met with suppression. The framing of Perl\u2019s show is such, but the scaffolding is weak as well. Perl inhabits different characters \u2013 a sentence mentor, an uncouth best man at a wedding, a cancelled pop star of yesteryears \u2013 to express the difficulty of forming a thought in the oversaturated world we live in and the corrosive power of nostalgia.",

        "text": "Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s weaker economy coupled with the Treasury\u2019s razor-thin headroom leaves the UK exposed to a \u201cnegative spiral\u201d similar to Greece\u2019s debt meltdown a decade ago, according to one of the world\u2019s biggest investment firms. Neil Robson, the head of global equities at Columbia Threadneedle, said Britain\u2019s \u00a32.8 trillion ($6 trillion) debt pile, which nearly outstrips the size of the economy, leaves it vulnerable as Trump\u2019s tariffs increase the risk of a global recession. Robson said: \u201cWe have had a Liz Truss moment here in the UK. Could we have a Labour version of that? Possibly. I think it\u2019s quite likely.\u201d He said Britain\u2019s current financial situation mirrored the lead-up to the eurozone meltdown when bond markets turned aggressively against Greece when investors suddenly realised the country could not balance its books.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you think about the problem of being very indebted, you can be as indebted as you like as long as your nominal growth is higher than your interest rate.\u201d \u201cBut if ever your nominal GDP growth stalls \u2013 not just on a temporary basis \u2013 below your interest costs then you\u2019re in a real negative spiral, and it can move really quickly. We saw that with Greece during the great financial crisis.\u201d British Chancellor Rachel Reeves had banked on faster economic growth to offset the UK\u2019s rising debt bill over the next five years, but an expected economic slump from The the US president\u2019s trade war has left that plan in tatters. Trump slapped a flat 10 per cent tariff on all nations, rising to as high as 50 per cent for the worst off. Although Britain escaped with the flat 10 per cent rate, its exposure to the global economy means growth forecasts are likely to be pared back and could trigger a crisis for UK debt, known as gilts, which are bought and sold by global investors.\n\n\u2018Double blow\u2019 for Britain Bruno Schneller, the managing partner at Erlen Capital Management, warned that the bond markets could turn against the UK if investors lose faith in Reeves\u2019s economic plan. Loading \u201c Trump\u2019s tariff blitz risks triggering a global stagflation shock \u2013 and for the UK, that\u2019s a recipe for a gilt crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cSlower growth, higher inflation and a jittery investor base could combine to push UK borrowing costs higher at the worst possible time. This isn\u2019t just trade war fallout; it\u2019s the kind of external shock that can crack already fragile debt markets.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs could deal a double blow to the UK \u2013 stalling global growth while fuelling inflation. That\u2019s a nightmare for any chancellor trying to stabilise debt. If markets lose confidence in the UK\u2019s fiscal path, a gilt sell-off isn\u2019t just possible \u2013 it\u2019s probable.\u201d It follows a dramatic week for the global economy after the scale of Trump\u2019s tariffs blitz caught markets by surprise. The turmoil also prompted JP Morgan to raise the risk of global recession this year to 60 per cent from 40 per cent as investor panic rattled stock markets around the world. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the US president\u2019s tariff increases were \u201csignificantly larger than expected\u201d. Credit: AP Although UK gilts have been boosted so far by Trump\u2019s tariffs, investors have warned this could soon change.\n\n\u201cIf Trump doesn\u2019t course-correct, this crisis will affect many different areas in global markets,\u201d said Harald Berlinicke, a partner at Sarnia Asset Management. Risk of more tax rises The gloomy message comes shortly after the chancellor slashed welfare benefits to restore \u00a39.9 billion of fiscal headroom at the Spring Statement. The Office for Budget Responsibility warned that in a worst-case scenario, a full-blown trade war risked wiping out all the margin of error she had left herself against her fiscal rules. This means that after a record \u00a340 billion tax-raising budget in October, Reeves may be forced to come back for more tax increases in her autumn Budget. Trump has vowed to persist with his aggressive tariffs despite last week\u2019s market bloodbath, insisting \u201cit\u2019s going very well\u201d and that the economy is \u201chealing\u201d.\n\nLoading The turmoil would be \u201csomething we are going to remember for a very long time\u201d, Robson said. \u201cRisks of recession have clearly gone up. I don\u2019t see why there won\u2019t be a recession at the moment. It\u2019s difficult to see what the solution is unless America walks back on this,\u201d he said. Some of the world\u2019s most important financial leaders have warned Trump that his aggressive trade policies will wreak havoc by depressing growth and fuelling inflation. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said on Friday that the president\u2019s tariff increases were \u201csignificantly larger than expected\u201d and so the same would \u201clikely be true of the economic effects\u201d.",

She\u2019s 71 years old, 160 centimetres tall, and exuberant as hell in blue-green hair, blasting through a recorder solo before chucking the instrument offstage. Cyndi Lauper performs at Rod Laver Arena, April 2, 2025. Credit: Martin Philbey The crowd are in tulle skirts, glitter and colourful wigs, which are on sale in the foyer \u2013 the money goes to her charity, Girls Just Wanna Have Fundamental Rights. Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. She still has a voice like a box of crayons, bright, messy, and expressive. She uses everything, with soaring vibrato, sometimes audibly out of breath, imprecise and alive. The set is \u201980s-heavy, leaning most on her \u201983 debut She\u2019s So Unusual, with some middle-of-the-road \u201990s stuff and, to my delight, the song she did for The Goonies thrown in.\n\nIt\u2019s a talky night. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bang-bang show,\u201d she says unapologetically in her irresistible Brooklyn drawl (\u201cIt\u2019s a paww-deee!\u201d). She tells us about family, the cousin who had a pigeon coop on her roof, the women who raised her and the way they\u2019d cut up old clothes and make something brand new with them. She does the same with her art, of course. Many of her songs are written by others but she makes them utterly her own. She tells us she recorded I Drove All Night, written for Roy Orbison, because there were no songs on the radio about women driving. \u201cWhen you get in the car and you can drive anywhere you freakin\u2019 want, that\u2019s a power song.\u201d Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top.

As this outfit\u2019s designer Christian Siriano told her: \u201cThe gays want glamour.\u201d For the evergreen Time After Time, Melbourne\u2019s Tones and I joins for a duet that\u2019s like every wedding dance floor you\u2019ve ever been on: messy and beautiful. And she delivers True Colours flawlessly, standing on a small satellite stage in the middle of the arena with a long rainbow scarf metres in the air.\n\nFor the finale, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, she\u2019s joined by The Veronicas, who sink into the background in a stage designed in polka-dot tribute to artist Yayoi Kusama. Even this, her signature tune, is a cover of a late-\u201970s pop-punk number, sung by a man, but I defy you to listen to that original and think of it as anything less than a sketch for Lauper to colour in and make something wonderful, defiant and punch-the-air fun.\n\nReviewed by Will Cox DANCE\n\nPoesis and The Bastard \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 5 The latest Dancehouse double bill features two works that differ wildly in their commitments to technique and virtuosity, but which together make for an invigorating and provoking evening of dance theatre. Gabriella Imrichova\u2019s cheekily titled The Bastard aims to challenge expectations with a surprising blend of theatre, performance art and only little dance. It\u2019s a bit punk and a bit mongrel, but consistently funny.\n\nThis is a performance in two halves. First, we get a dry parody of non-dance, a somewhat dated form of experimental dance in which movement is withheld: it\u2019s slow and repetitious and very low effort. Loading Either side of this performance, Imrichova addresses the audience, simulating apprehension about its reception: about whether it fits the context and whether it works as dance. It\u2019s mischievous but not without charm. Then follows a wild rant about art and novelty. There were a few walkouts on opening night, but that\u2019s surely a victory for an artist who declares that trolling is a creative practice. Prue Lang\u2019s Poesis sits more securely within the conventions of contemporary dance. It\u2019s a duet in which the two dancers generate striking compositions from subtle contrasts in form, line and intention.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We picked a number one invention of the year and this year it is the retail DNA test, pioneered by a company called 23andMe. Essentially what it is, it comes in this box, you open it up, inside is a vial, you spit in the vial, you send them the spit and they will scan your genome and they will tell you what health conditions you might be at risk for. We consider this to be an absolutely revolutionary invention that will change forever the way we think about healthcare and the way we think about our personal information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Time Magazine's announcement of the invention of the year in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company 23andMe had begun two years earlier in 2006 with a simple premise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you could know more about your DNA, you could understand your ancestry, your risk factors for health conditions and could even ensure your medical treatment was personalised for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the almost twenty years since the arrival of 23andMe, has the genetic revolution actually happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No. It turns out biology is always more complicated than what we hoped.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Dr Philipp Bayer, one of the researchers behind an open-source database for people who had completed a direct-to-consumer genetic testing kit to upload their results.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the group created OpenSNP in 2011 to open access to everyone, not just the pharmaceutical companies that could afford access to commercial data sets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey hoped that by increasing access to genetic data, more medical discoveries could occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a blog post, a fellow researcher said it would give the individual the choice to contribute rather than having researchers or companies broker the access.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Bayer says genetic research hasn't gone the way that was expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And back then we didn't know how much one of these pieces of DNA can tell you about someone's disease or propensity to disease or probability to develop some other melody in your life. We just didn't know back then, and by now, 14 years later, we know that the biology is always more complicated than you assume. There's always far more factors working on figuring these outcomes, and it's just not the single data point that can help you predict what's happening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jan Charbonneau is an adjunct researcher at the Centre for Law and Genetics at the University of Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that for some customers in the US, the results of genetic data testing can actually have unexpected impacts on eligibility for health insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you sign up for health insurance through your company, whatever, you attest that you do not know of any genetic predispositions. Well, if you've had a 23 and me test, of course that's not part of your health record. But by saying no thinking, you're keeping your genetic results out of the official records. Of course that could compromise your health insurance later.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the US Government passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act which protects against genetic discrimination in employment, a law that was expanded to include health insurance plans a year later.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, a doctors group has been campaigning for similar legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government announced in September 2024 that it would ban genetic discrimination in life insurance - but no legislation has passed yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Medical Association vice president, Associate Professor Julian Rait, says the future of the ban is uncertain as we head into a federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well look, we are still confident that the government's heart is in the right place about this particular piece of legislation. Obviously it\u2019s been deferred as a consequence of the election and we would hope that in the new term of whatever the government might follow that we would be able to advocate for that legislation being passed and obviously then promulgated so that people are better protected.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMA's statement on genetic testing says genomics will rapidly transform the sector, and should be incorporated into everyday healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Associate Professor Rait says people should consult their doctor when considering one of these tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The AMA has forewarned since about 2012 of the ethical challenges of genetic testing, in particular the privacy risk and also the cybersecurity risks, because of the shared nature of the information. It's not just your own DNA in some ways, it's also shared by many family members. And so, therefore there's the potential for information to be exposed that might not be necessarily, you know, to the comfort of all the other members of the family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers behind OpenSNP have decided to delete all of their data, along with their website, at the end of April.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Bayer says the decision comes from a cost benefit analysis amid the issues with 23andMe - and the growth of far right governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is this data actually helping people or will it be used to the detriment of people and to us currently looks like it'll be more used to the detriment of people. So that's triggered this decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer customers of 23andMe are also asking questions about what to do with their data, now 23andMe have filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Rait says there are concerns around data protection, with some customer data appearing on the dark web after 23andMe experienced a data breach in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's the legitimate sale of the company's assets as the bankruptcy proceeds that is also raising questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has said in a statement that the sale would not impact how customer data is managed, but the Attorney-General of California, where the company's headquarters is located, has warned customers to consider deleting their data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now there are procedures in place to be able to go in and ask 23andMe to delete your data. My question has always been, first off, will they do it? They tell you they're going to do it. What kind of confirmation do we have other than you get an email from them saying, we've deleted your data. But when you shop and think where that data has gone, how could we possibly delete it from these large databases?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Charbonneau says the sale of the company will result in the sale of their information.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says some customers might not understand yet that's what could happen - given they had to read 13 different documents to understand what they were signing up for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, even as lawyers, we have struggled with some of them and I wonder if the general public, what do they make of a jurisdiction clause? What do they make about assigning their rights in their DNA? Do they understand what these things mean in terms of their actual protections?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Charbonneau has one piece of advice for those who are still considering a direct to consumer DNA test: to consider everything.\n\n\n\n",

This tariff policy is completely unreasonable for the development of the global economy, and even for the development of the US economy itself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has promised that if re-elected, Labor will reduce the cost of installing a typical home battery by 30 per cent from July 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nBatteries store power from solar panels for households and businesses to use when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed discount would reduce the upfront cost of the 11.5-kilowatt-hour battery purchased for a household by $4,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall businesses and community facilities would also be eligible for a battery discount.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor says it expects the discount to help see 1 million new batteries installed by 2030 under the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure is estimated to cost $2.3 billion over the forward estimates, including in the 2025-26 budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nFootage from a slain Palestinian medic appears to contradict Israeli claims about the deaths of 15 medics in southern Gaza on the 23rd of March.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society recovered the mobile phone of one of the men killed which shows an almost seven-minute interview filmed from inside the moving vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows clearly marked ambulances driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights. The vehicle is stopped, pulling up alongside an ambulance that had come under fire earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen gunfire erupts and the screen goes black.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani says troops opened fire on vehicles that had no prior clearance to enter the area, and were driving with their lights off.\n\n\n\n\n\nParamedic Munzer Abed survived the attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe confirmed the veracity of the video - and says he rejects Israel's account of what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was heavy shooting directly at us in the vehicle. I took cover, going down in the cabin, in the backseat to protect myself from the shooting. I didn't hear a sound from my colleagues . I didn't see them because I was then surprised by people speaking Hebrew, who turned out to be special forces from the Israeli army, wearing their uniforms, and with guns and night vision goggles. They opened the side door, in the back, (leading) to me and they kicked me out of the vehicle. They made me take off all my clothes, then they let me put on my underwear.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military says it did not randomly attack any ambulances, insisting they opened fired on who they believed were Hamas militants approaching them in suspicious vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael says a review is being conducted into the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nAid organisations have been praised for their humanitarian response to Myanmar's devastating earthquake as the death toll continues to climb - now reaching over 3300.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights says aid groups have been acting with courage, skill and determination to help the survivors, despite reports the junta has been restricting aid supplies to quake-hit areas where communities did not back its rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN's aid chief Tom Fletcher says the population has already been struggling to cope with widespread food insecurity and displacement caused by the post-coup civil war.\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer aid worker Zaw Win says they are also concerned about how to prevent disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that diseases like cholera could break out in the community. The big issue is to manage trash properly as people are staying on the street and throwing away a lot of waste. That is the concern for people in the city.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nBrawling NRL fans could face the prospect of stadium bans following a clash between supporters at Friday night's classic match between rivals South Sydney and the Sydney Roosters.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Venues New South Wales spokesman says anyone found to be committing brawling offices will be dealt with by police, and face being stopped from coming to future events.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Police have confirmed officers were called to a section of Accor Stadium during the second half of the game.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not often a brand-new federal electorate is created.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Western Australia, the seat of Bullwinkel is the latest example.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first member for Bullwinkel will be elected at the upcoming federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor local resident and sheep farmer Peter Boyle, the live sheep export issue is key to his economic livelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been farming here since 1855. I don't know where we are going to go next year, because there's huge reduction in sheep numbers all around us. We won't be able to buy shore sheep and fatten them for my type of market. It's going to be very difficult even to supply it for live shipping.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government has announced it is banning live sheep exports by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says it has a clear mandate to reverse the ban\u2014promising to \"Keep the Sheep\" if it wins the upcoming election.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud says the first step would be restoring trust with Middle Eastern trading partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My first international trip will be to Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, to Morocco - to show them some respect, that we are an important part of their food security. And we should be a trusted partner that they can rely on. And when this madness has ended, and that they can rely on us to continue to send with the best animal welfare standards in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the fight for Bullwinkel is about more than just agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new federal seat was introduced to accommodate Western Australia\u2019s growing population - bringing WA\u2019s total to 16 federal electorates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanning Perth\u2019s eastern suburbs and parts of the Wheatbelt, it bridges two very different communities - each with their own priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtin University political expert, John Phillimore, says that mix makes it difficult to predict the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Notionally a Labor seat, with a pretty close margin of two to three per cent. But I think most commentators would expect that in a normal federal election year, it would probably be a marginal Liberal seat because Labor got such a huge vote last time around.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Coalition, the key challenge is making rural issues resonate with suburban voters - where cost of living is the biggest concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a small barbershop in the heart of the electorate, shop owner Hussein Naser says times are tough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has four kids, a mortgage and runs his own business\u2014but with rising costs, he's struggling to keep up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019ve had to cut the staff down because customers stopped spending enough money. We still have the same customers, but they don\u2019t come as regularly as before. So some of them, every fortnight, they then come every month. And the people that come every month, they start coming from two to three months.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Labor candidate Trish Cook, the economy is front and centre of her campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when she visited Bullwinkel recently, she was shielded from media questions on live exports\u2014with [[Veterans' Affairs]] Minister Matt Keogh stepping in before she eventually responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrish Cook was pressed on whether focusing too much on cost-of-living concerns could risk alienating farming communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, I am campaigning on the issues that matter to the people. So, I am a nurse, I've been a nurse for a long time, I've lived in this area for 20 odd years. I know this area very well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for voters like Hussein Naser, the biggest issue isn\u2019t just what politicians promise - it\u2019s whether they follow through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Politicians will promise you lots of stuff. But if they promise ten things, how many will actually be done?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to the race for Bullwinkel, the answer may depend on party politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike at the federal level, where the Coalition is united, the Nationals and Liberals in WA risk splitting the vote - especially if they clash on state issues.\n\n\n\n",

Based on the proposed new legislation, Italians living abroad can no longer apply for citizenship by demonstrating ancestry through their great-grandparents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria (not her real name), who was born in Australia but gained Italian citizenship through descent, spent years navigating the citizenship process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on her own struggle to secure an Italian passport, she feels for other Italian-Australians who will now face even greater hurdles in attaining citizenship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I ended up slipping my paperwork under the door of the Italian consulate in Brisbane,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They refused to open the door for me to give them the papers in person because apparently there was no security available to be present, even though I had prearranged and confirmed my appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"$700 worth of paperwork slid ominously under a door. It was such a massive gamble.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though Maria's application was successful in the end, it was exactly two years after Maria took the risk of leaving her paperwork at the consulate before her Italian citizenship was recognised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe only found out she was successful by receiving a voting slip for an Italian election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really feel for those who are now in limbo because so much work goes into preparing documents, not to mention costly lawyer fees, only to have the door literally shut in your face when proving your heritage,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Who you need to be friends with to apply for Australian citizenship\n\nWhat are the changes?\n\nUnder existing rules, anyone who can prove they had an Italian ancestor who was alive after 17 March 1861, when the Kingdom of Italy was created, can seek citizenship.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the new legislation introduces several restrictions that particularly impact applicants residing abroad:\n\n\n\nItalian citizenship will now be automatically granted only up to the second generation, meaning only those with at least one parent or grandparent born in Italy will be eligible\n\nFor children born abroad to Italian citizens, automatic citizenship will apply only if one of their parents had resided in Italy for at least two continuous years before their birth\n\nThe new rules apply retroactively from 27 March 2025 \u2014 impacting individuals regardless of their birth date.\n\nIn a statement, the Italian consulate in Melbourne said: \"These reforms are part of a broader effort to modernise citizenship laws in line with contemporary migration patterns and international standards\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes \"will free up resources to make consular services more efficient, allowing them to focus exclusively on those with a genuine need, based on their actual connection to Italy,\" it added.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE World leaders are cracking down on dual citizens \u2014 and Peter Dutton wants to join them\n\nWhy did the Italian government make the change?\n\nItalian foreign minister and deputy prime minister Antonio Tajani \u2014 a member of the conservative Forza Italia party, which governs in a coalition led by the nationalist right-wing Brothers of Italy \u2014 has defended the new rules, arguing that the citizenship process had been misused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, over the years, there have been abuses and citizenship requests that went somewhat beyond genuine interest in our country,\" Tajani said last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly's foreign ministry said would-be Italians have swamped consulates abroad with requests for passports, which provide visa-free entry to more countries than almost any other nationality.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, the number of Italians living abroad rose by 40 per cent, from 4.6 million to 6.4 million, many registering thanks to their newfound nationality, according to the foreign ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\nTajani said companies were making a fortune by helping people track down their long-forgotten ancestors and seek birth certificates needed for applications \u2014 clogging up municipal offices with their demands for documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are striking down very hard against those who want to make money from the opportunity of becoming an Italian citizen,\" Tajani said, adding that in future, nationality requests would be handled directly in Rome to free up overburdened consulates.\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly has a population of around 59 million, which has been shrinking over the past decade. The foreign ministry has estimated that, under the old rules, 60 to 80 million people worldwide were eligible for citizenship.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane-based Italian lawyer Fabrizio Fiorino said that both sides of politics in Italy seem to be in agreement, signalling that citizenship reforms were long overdue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The last time we had a citizenship reform was 1992, so Italy is overdue for change,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAn estimated 0.6% of Australians were born in Italy according to the ABS. Source: SBS News\n\nBacklash from the Italian-Australian community\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, just over one million Australians have Italian ancestry, and more than 160,000 Australian residents were born in Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian parliament has four overseas electorates, and representing citizens in Australia is Nicola Car\u00e8 \u2014 the Democratic Party MP for the constituency of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Antarctic (AAOA).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that the AAOA electorate has 250,000 Italian citizens living abroad, with the Guardian reporting an estimated 140,000 registered Italian voters living in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nCar\u00e8 told Australia's Il Globo newspaper that the changes are \"an attack on the fundamental rights of emigrants and their descendants\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The recent changes to the Italian citizenship law are unacceptable and ridiculous,\" Car\u00e8 said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Becoming an Italian citizen is not just a formality; it's a recognition of identity, culture and belonging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These changes upend and deny acquired rights, undermining the dignity of millions of Italians abroad and their families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Giacobbe, the Democratic Party senator for the AAOA, also criticised the decree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What difference does it make to grant citizenship to someone who, before the birth of their children, lived for two years in Italy compared to someone who hasn't lived in Italy but deeply experiences Italian identity while living abroad?\" Giacobbe told SBS Italian.\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal experts have also voiced concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian-based Italian lawyer Alessia Comandini noted that while discussions about tightening citizenship rules had gone on for some time, the immediate implementation of the decree has left many applicants in limbo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen cases where people who had all their documents prepared suddenly had their appointments cancelled with no explanation,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe decree is currently in effect but requires parliamentary approval within 60 days to become permanent law.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after the decree was enacted, the Italian consulates in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth all announced that appointments and applications for citizenship by descent had been suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly the Melbourne consulate has since publicly stated that it has resumed processing citizenship applications.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we learn to live with the effects of climate change?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat question was considered at length at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP-13, in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere, the international community came to understand that climate adaptation is just as important as mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Simon Bradshaw, a fellow with the Climate Council and director at Climate-KIC Australia, explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In responding to climate change, there's really two key tasks. First and most important is we've got to get our greenhouse gas emissions down as fast as possible by moving beyond fossil fuels. That's coal, oil and gas to renewable energy. That's essential to limiting future harms. We're already seeing a real acceleration in the impacts of climate change and worsening fire seasons, more destructive storms and downpours. Now, the second thing we have to do at the same time is adapt and build our resilience and learn to cope with these various impacts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, in 2008, the federal government initiated the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility to develop the knowledge decision-makers needed to effectively adapt Australia to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut its findings are yet to be translated into action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lag is reflected in a new report by researchers at Monash University.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found local action on climate adaptation remains insufficient across tiers of government, with little change over the decade between 2012 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-author and Adjunct Senior Research Fellow at Green Lab in the Monash Business School, Dr Michael Spencer, says that's despite willingness from vulnerable communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says those who have experienced bushfires, coastal erosion, flooding and drought want to help create adaptation measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The governance structures weren't there, the finance wasn't there, the means of implementation wasn't there. So, in order to actually act on that information, you need to have the capacity to act, you need to have the governance regime at a local level to act, and you need to have access to the funds to actually implement that action.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA second study, by researchers at the University of New South Wales, has found disaster recovery is being delayed by a lack of strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLead researcher and inaugural Judith Neilson Chair in Architecture at the University of New South Wales, Professor David Sanderson, says top-down bureaucracy has stifled any meaningful effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a global evidence truth that the best recovery is as localised as possible. But we have in Australia and elsewhere systems which are largely top down and the sweet spot is supporting recovery of communities rather than, if you like, directing from afar. That's a quick summary of a complex story, but what we've noticed in our research \u2013 and again in pretty much every country \u2013 local governments are tasked with a lot of the picking up the pieces, if you like, but yet are woefully under-resourced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also says short-term solutions are wasteful and rob vulnerable communities of the chance to build resilience in the face of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A kneejerk political reaction \u2013 it often is to think quick, we need to build temporary housing after a disaster and that's all over the place. But the problem with temporary housing is it's slow, it's expensive, and there's really a plan for what to do afterwards. So, we're arguing that temporary housing, if you build it, is an absolute last resort. There may be arguably a case for it, but a last resort and there must be a plan for its investment in continuation afterwards. There must be a plan for its investment in continuation afterwards so it's a valuable asset to the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shortfall in strategy has also accelerated cost-of-living pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Treasury's Intergenerational Report pointed to the escalating costs of natural disasters borne by taxpayers, which reached $7 billion in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Spencer says those higher costs are reflected in insurance policies and in other ways that are less immediately detectable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Natural disasters, which have a very dramatic impacts and you're seeing the impact of that in your insurance policies. In the last quarterly CPI, insurance was one of the biggest areas of increase in terms of cost of living. But the slow burn is in things like health and mental health, and we tend to not take as much notice of those areas because they're very slow, but cumulatively they can be just as severe if not more severe than the natural disaster impact.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 Climate Trauma study by the Climate Council found 80 per cent of Australians experienced some form of disaster at least once since 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason for that, Dr Bradshaw says, is houses are being zoned and built in high-risk areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fair to say that updates to planning regulations have just not kept up with the increasing impacts of climate change, be that flood risk or be that fire risk. Now, we have seen some improvements here, some re-zoning, some restrictions on building in particularly flood prone areas. But we do still have new developments being built on flood plains and we still have an enormous number of our houses built in places where people are inevitably going to face real difficulty in future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stressing urgency, Dr Spencer says the way adaption efforts are approached needs to be more holistic, pointing to what he calls \"district modelling\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Climate impacts don't respect jurisdiction. They will cross jurisdictions of local government, they'll involve the catchment management authority, they'll involve the chamber of commerce. So, the challenge is to cross jurisdictional boundaries, but also institutional silos. In Australia and in many other parts of the world, we tend to put responsibility for adaptation into our silos but we need to see it as an integrated whole. So the first thing is how we bring all those different players together in order to deal with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Bradshaw says the only way forward is to listen to those on the front lines of the climate crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These impacts aren't felt equally, and we need to have a mind to those who were particularly exposed and vulnerable in our community. It was a few years ago on Masig Island and the Torres Strait Islands where we saw that communities there were working with almost no external support to hold back the coastal erosion using old tires and pallets, anything at their disposal and have been trying so hard to get additional resources to protect their islands and their millennia-old connection to place there. We need to be really listening to and looking out for those on the front lines of this crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government will deliver its now-overdue new National Climate Risk Assessment and National Adaptation Plan after the election.\n\n\n\n",

And sometimes they would get exceeding, and that's why I potentially left the other learning consultant role. I was so despondent with it because I thought, are you not seeing what I see?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what has gone wrong with Australia's early childhood education and care system?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problems within the sector rest on multiple fronts and make for a complicated web of policy, workforce education and regulation issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand it, we need to look at how early childhood education and care is provided and funded in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEarly Childhood Education and Care in Australia hasn't always been a for-profit enterprise or been available to for-profit providers. So, in the seventies when childcare was originally introduced and funded by the Commonwealth, the system was built around direct subsidies provided to not-for-profit services. And they were able to regulate the qualification levels of staff. The Commonwealth used its funding to position childcare as a public good.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was University of Sydney Department of Political Economy Professor Elizabeth Hill explaining the impact government childcare subsidies have had on the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subsidies support the cost of early childhood education and care - the subsidy is given to families to purchase a service they want to use and is then paid to that service when the child enrols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut then there was, we've had increased participation of women in, paid work and by the 1990s, there was real pressure on the federal government to expand the provision. And so at that point, federal government subsidies started to be extended to for profit providers, and that really changed the landscape in terms of who owns and who provides those services.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gave private investors incentive to open childcare centres to be provided by a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit suppliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildcare has become increasingly popular amongst commercial property investors, who can open centres with supportive government funding without being regulated by the government in terms of how they run, staff or locate their centres.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Childhood Australia CEO Samantha Page highlights the problems that occur when childcare services are opened as profit-making ventures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have what we call childcare deserts, which is where we have no services available to families because the numbers of children are too small or because providers simply have chosen not to go into that community. Particulary in regional and remote areas. We also have a problem with oversupply. So, If you've got too many services in one community, they're all competing for the same pool of staff, for the same children. And half empty services are not good, they're not viable and they're not high quality generally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidelines for childcare quality regulation are written under the National Quality Framework and enforced by state and territory regulators working under The Australian Children\u2019s Education & Care Quality Authority ((ACECQA)).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Authority responded to the recent investigations into unsafe for-profit services by taking action against the operators, and trying to ensure that 91 per cent of Australia's services are meeting or exceeding the National Quality Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's 2024 Productivity Commission found that these regulators, like most areas of the early childhood education and care sector, are under-resourced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe early childhood education and care profession is amongst the lowest paid in Australia and has been historically undervalued.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Hill says this is because it's a hyper-feminised workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that early childhood education and care has been normalised as women's work has meant that it's been historically undervalued. There's been a lot of change in the attitude of the public, but workers are still waiting for that attitude and that revaluation of their work to be reflected in their professional wages.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poor treatment of these educators means students don't choose to study early childhood education past entry level qualifications.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly childhood specialist Victoria Mack says the profession is viewed as an option of last resort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know even when I was working at TAFE, and we'd have some of the students that they would start their cert three coming through tafe and they would say to us, oh, you're good with children or you're not very good at all maths and science, you're not going to get into uni, so you can just go and do childcare. I think sometimes these young girls go into early childhood and night-long daycare centres, and they don't see another option for them. I mean, I was an early childhood teacher and I had an opportunity to do lots of different things. I've worked overseas in international schools as an early childhood teacher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a federal election looms, calls have been heard across the sector to address the problems in Australia's early childhood education and care system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government has responded by saying it intends to take action against dodgy providers and improve childcare policy in consultation with state government regulatory bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Childhood Australia CEO Samantha Page says it's also time to value early childhood education and care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The profession itself is really, very strong. We have a code of ethics, we have teaching standards we have the national quality standards. I think theres a strong and positive identity for early childhood educators and teachers. We need the rest of the country to see that. And we wanna recognise that the people who work in those services are educators and teachers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Newly minted doctor Noah Szto brings together music, comedy and PowerPoint to offer a skew-eyed look into the realities of what it takes to pursue a career in medicine. Med School is at ACMI until April 20. Credit: Ian Laidlaw While Szto does not shy away from getting into the weeds of his particular experiences, he does a deft job of navigating both the specific and the broad. If you are or know someone who is in the medical field, there are enough \u201cin\u201d jokes to make you feel catered to, but not so many to be alienating to everyone else. Yes, this is a show all about medicine and med school, in particular \u2013 Szto performs the whole thing in scrubs (and, yes, there is a minor medical procedure as promised). At the same time, if you\u2019ve never set foot in a hospital, the running themes \u2013 art v science, prestige over precarity, loss of identity, and being worn down by an institution \u2013 extend far beyond the medical field. If you\u2019ve ever had to make the sensible choice over following your passions, the core of this show taps into that complex web of feelings, jazzes it up with a song, a dance and a laugh, and offers up a glimmer of hope.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Elizabeth Flux\n\nFrankie McNair and Isaac Haigh | The Booth Variety Spectacular & Formal Apology Hour!\n\nArts Centre Melbourne \u2013 Members Lounge, until April 20 Tabitha Booth (a resplendent Frankie McNair in character) has been on air for 12 years \u2013 you may know her as the Long-Forked Lady. But as she inauspiciously turns 40, she\u2019s being Substance-ed by young upstart Isaac Haigh. What antics can we expect from our favourite emotionally dysregulated silver-screen siren in her final show as host? The Booth Variety Spectacular & Formal Apology Hour! is on at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. As soon as you step into the Member\u2019s Lounge, you\u2019re immediately transported into the frenzied hubbub of a live-studio audience. This immersive veracity is maintained throughout \u2013 audience members are handed cue cards, the lights go up between the filming of zany segments, and we become privy to the unravelling of both Tabitha and the show as the night progresses. This meticulous attention to detail is mirrored in the set, costumes, ensemble cast and variety show ephemera. Perennially shimmying, McNair has perfected performing a woman perpetually on the brink, while Haigh is impeccable as her smooth, supercilious co-host-turned-interloper. Alice Tovey is our guest comedian of the night and although her contemporary references disrupt the old-world feel of 1969, it\u2019s a solid set. The funniest moments transpire within the many immaculately constructed layers of the show: the action unfolding behind Tabitha as she demurs about turning 40, the televised close-ups of remonstrations, the uproarious ad breaks, and the disconnect between what\u2019s seen to be happening and what\u2019s actually happening in the thrilling denouement.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nLou Wall | Breaking the Fifth Wall\n\nComedy Republic, until April 20 The zeitgeist rumbles through every MICF. This year, it\u2019s all about AI, conspiracy theories, truthism and bald-faced lies. Breaking The Fifth Wall is on until April 20. Lou Wall has built an entire show around telling porkies for laughs. Even though we\u2019re told this upfront, the various betrayals, twists and turns that unfold as the hour progresses land perfectly every time. Wall is from the iPad Kid generation of comics for whom multimedia is always close at hand. This forms part of the elaborate set-up as we whiz through PowerPoints, Facebook Messenger recaps, deepfakes and Wall dialling into tense FaceTimes with themself. It\u2019s an amped-up, maxed-out variety hour with a compelling meta-narrative, incorporating games, comedy tunes, sneaky sleight of hand and even some slam poetry. Wall is so relaxed and natural in every guise they inhabit, it\u2019s no wonder we are putty in their hands.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nGuy Montgomery | I\u2019ve noticed so many things, It\u2019d be unfair to keep them to myself\n\nAthenaeum Theatre, until April 20 Will he or won\u2019t he? This question (no spoilers as to why) will run through your mind regularly during the offbeat ponderings of Guy Montgomery, who by his own admission is staying in much nicer accommodation since the roaring success of his television panel game show Guy Montgomery\u2019s Guy Mont-Spelling Bee. I\u2019ve Noticed So Many Things, It\u2019d Be Unfair To Keep Them To Myself is on until April 20. Self-deprecating as he warms up the crowd, the show launches with aplomb. On this night, he seems genuinely stunned that \u2013 when asked \u2013 a bloke in the front row publicly shares his actual email address. Montgomery\u2019s artful play on words, his over-arching smarts and congeniality is lapped up. Thoughts on water temperature, real estate agents and zoos are riotous. It feels like the room is hanging on his every syllable. Each quip is met with laughter. It\u2019s a delightful ride. And ultimately, the burning question that repeatedly surfaces gets answered.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nEmma Holland | Don\u2019t Touch My Trinkets\n\nACMI, until April 20 Art lover Emma Holland\u2019s origin story begins with being told off for touching the iconic Capitoline Wolf statue in Rome. Denied this contact, she embarks on a life where she will have unfettered access by making her own, which she displays here for us (but no touching). Don\u2019t Touch My Trinkets is at ACMI until April 20. Credit: Your Local Film Lab Don\u2019t Touch My Trinkets artfully combines physical comedy, props, audience engagement and PowerPoint presentation. Holland has many strings to her comedy bow and plays them to perfection, eliciting delighted laughter from the audience. She works the crowd with ease, using direct eye contact and the smallest of gestures to draw the whole room in. As Holland ends the show, she raises questions about her own relationship to art, creativity and audience. What ethical quandaries does it bring up? Have we become complicit in her weaponising the art form of comedy? It\u2019s an interesting question that Holland ultimately leaves hanging, instead opting for an ending with more laughs.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nAnisa Nandaula | You Can\u2019t Say That\n\nThe Victoria Hotel, until April 20 Anisa Nandaula is disarmingly charming, luring you in with her warmth and candour onstage. She shares how she acclimatised to Australian culture after migrating from Uganda, growing up in blaringly white cities in Queensland. You Can\u2019t Say That is at the Victoria Hotel until April 20. Nandaula\u2019s approach is conversational, from asking audience members casual questions, like their vocation, to more probing ones, such as if they\u2019ve ever cut anyone out of their lives, eliciting interesting responses. For those unnerved by the limelight, she gives them latitude to rebuff her advances by responding with a \u201cbye b\u2014\u201d. This generates an air of comfort, with one attendee chiming in on Nandaula\u2019s enquiry about culturally diverse friendship groups: \u201cThere\u2019s black people in Thornbury!\u201d Her set starts off a little awkwardly as she occasionally falters her delivery and doesn\u2019t quite land the punchlines. When she eventually hits her groove, she\u2019s unstoppable, playing out scenarios with a bombastic side-eye and confident strut. If you\u2019re seeking a comedic act that will keep you at ease, Nandaula should be your pick.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nLizzy Hoo | Deja Hoo\n\nThe Victoria Hotel \u2013 Banquet Room, until April 20 If you weighed Lizzy Hoo\u2019s likeability, you\u2019d break the scales. In a testament to her skills, she\u2019s racked up a multitude of television credits \u2013 including her 2023 Amazon Prime Video comedy special, Hoo cares!? \u2013 since her stand-up debut in 2017. Deja Hoo is on at The Victoria Hotel until April 20. Credit: Chris Hillary Confidently, she poses the question \u201care you ready for the best night of your life?\u201d before embarking on a fun showcase of witticisms, celebrating her Chinese-Malaysian Irish-Australian heritage. There\u2019s a slew of absorbing stories about dating, brotherly bullying, the joys of living solo and the perfect gift selection for a mother. The audience chuckles along. A line about greyhounds is blooming hilarious. It\u2019s not a Lizzy Hoo show without a tale about dad, Chan Hoo, she says \u2013 admitting a quick call to her brother furnishes her with yet another delightful story to share.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nHarry Jun | Friendship Safari\n\nThe Greek \u2013 Apollo, until April 20 Most classic stand-up falls into one of three categories: contrarian edgelord, trauma spiller, affable friend. Luckily, Harry Jun belongs to the latter, and that might just be the whole point of his show. Friendship Safari is at The Greek until April 20. While Friendship Safari is ostensibly about friendship and its complexities, Jun moves swiftly onto other subjects. There are snippets from a previous life as a schoolteacher \u2013 among other life stories \u2013 with some bemusing curveballs. His past wrangling dead-eyed teen children turns out to be a skill set transferable to bringing high energy to a quiet night. The night I go, only three people are in the audience. Yet, Jun takes it on the chin and delivers the show nonetheless with aplomb, although his brio gives way to a glimmer of defeat at the very end. If every comedian\u2019s got a schtick, Jun\u2019s is trivia. There\u2019s a sense of watching an earnest friend regale you with their learnings and seeing how much fun they have doing it. In a world of chaos and irony, Jun\u2019s sincerity charms.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan\n\nSuren Jayemanne | There\u2019s A World Where My Head Ought To Be\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 There\u2019s a World Where My Head Ought Be is at the Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. Suren Jayemanne used to sell himself as the guy who gave up accounting to do comedy, but is now turning over a new leaf. When someone else called him an artist, he saw himself as one for the first time. He\u2019s a smart comedian and unafraid to raise the stakes. Jayemanne is also having somewhat of an identity crisis provoked by getting a new photograph for his license. It\u2019s worse than you think. In his photo, he\u2019s a white woman. His time waiting at VicRoads has Jayemanne considering the divine within ourselves, and he thinks we should all be considering it, too. It\u2019s the kind of smart comedy brave enough to bring big questions into the room and rely on the gravity of the story to bring the humour. The result is a satisfying show with something to say.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nAlanah Parkin | Garage Sale\n\nDouble Tree by Hilton, until April 6 Allow yourself to be transported to Narre Warren South (39 kilometres south-east of Melbourne) for Alanah Parkin\u2019s debut solo show, where older couple Denise and Greg are downsizing \u2013 hence, holding a garage sale. Garage Sale is at DoubleTree by Hilton until April 6. Among the sale items strewn across the stage are hats, scarves, doilies and a video porn collection. A wonderfully unpredictable, somewhat chaotic, 50 minutes of escalating comedy-drama ensues, presented by a variety of lively, absurd characters. Grandma is a hoot. A litany of giggles follows as the audience is invited to participate in a Jane Fonda-esque workout routine. Video and voiceover vignettes allow Parkin to dart backstage for necessary costume changes, giving rise to amusing moments. Clearly gifted, Parkin revels in gloriously ridiculous scenarios (picture a poetry-reciting rag-doll or a self-help guide for aged-out choir boys) in a quirky show that takes a rather unexpected turn.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nPierre Novellie | Must We?\n\nThe Westin, until April 18 It\u2019s easy to warm to this giant Millennial good boy in a baby-blue suit. His crisp delivery and Attenborough-esque enthusiasm might not endear him to the more blokey comedy crowd, but anyone at the Douglas Adams end of the humour spectrum will find themselves in good hands here. Must We? is at The Westin until April 18. He\u2019s a detail guy: an impromptu bit of audience banter has him noting that our shrinking chocolate teddy bear snacks are due to illegal gold mining in Ghana. His brain carries a lot that way. The show\u2019s first third is likeable if not groundbreaking guy-with-a-mic bizzo, but the remainder is tighter and generates those barks of recognition that fine observational comedy evokes. The show sticks the landing, too, with a quietly insistent reminder that stand-up, like society, must be a broad church if its members are to survive. (And for the blokes: denim condoms.)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by John Bailey\n\nAlex Ward | Clip Clop Don\u2019t Stop\n\nSwiss Club, until April 20 Do you have pretty privilege? You probably don\u2019t know if you do, according to how the theory goes. Alex Ward is convinced she has something similar: pretty approachable. That\u2019s where you have a face that welcomes everyone and anyone to strike up conversation, ask you for directions or assume you work here \u2026 wherever here happens to be. Clip Clop Don\u2019t Stop is at the Swiss Club until April 20. Being approachable has led to some entertaining situations, which Ward easily wins over her audience by telling us about. This show is filled with likeable banter and quick jokes. Mostly the target of her humour is herself, making her material all the more approachable. It\u2019s relatable humour to go with her relatable face. This is a neatly structured show which takes satisfying sidetracks, entertaining diversions and clever callbacks. The audience keeps up a steady rate of laughter throughout. It takes skill to make it look this easy, which Ward does.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nZo\u00eb Coombs Marr | The Splash Zone\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr is a master of meta. Her fast-paced comedy can be variously subversive, confoundingly circular and wildly clever. The Splash Zone is a light-hearted offering \u2013 and about as straight up and down as Marr gets. The Splash Zone is at the Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. Credit: Christa Holka We hear of growing up in Grafton, in northern NSW, life-defining moments that arrive while waiting for a train, Aussies abroad and Americans Down Under, and Trump-loving patrons who seem a bit lost. References to ADHD and audience distractions collide with commentary on social fragmentation, conspiracy theories and the growing disconnect between thoughts and facts. As a whole, the show relies too much on said audience distractions and cultural references. Some of the punchlines are predictably daggy, but the fans lap them up. While Marr\u2019s award-winning character, Dave, skewered gendered structures in comedy to perfection almost a decade ago, a sidebar here about nasty male comedians misses the mark at a festival that has made increasing efforts to celebrate diversity in recent years. It\u2019s early in the run, but Marr\u2019s latest offering feels somewhat disjointed itself. Then again, perhaps that\u2019s the point.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nAmy Gledhill | Make Me Look Fit On The Poster\n\nThe Westin, until April 5 We\u2019re barely two minutes into Amy Gledhill\u2019s show and the audience is already swinging underwear in the air. Make Me Look Fit On The Poster is at The Westin until April 5. Just to be clear, no one was actually undressing \u2013 but having a show start with strangers handling mysterious undergarments certainly loosens a crowd up. This is what Gledhill\u2019s stand-up is all about \u2013 stripping down to crack up. Fresh off the back of her award-winning Edinburgh Fringe Festival run, she shares personal tales like she\u2019s chatting with a best friend. We learn about her experiences of \u201ccursed\u201d oral sex, and the time she mistook Stranger Things\u2019 Finn Wolfhard for a \u201clittle tiny orphan boy\u201d. Sprinkled in between the gags, she confides in us about her admittedly low self-esteem and warped body image.\n\nLoading Granted, not every yarn sticks the landing \u2013 a three-minute spiel about how much toilet paper she accumulates fizzles hard \u2013 and some of her references are too British to translate to an Australian crowd. But what she lacks in knee-slapping punchlines, she makes up for in both physical comedy (her re-enactment of dangling from a tree like a \u201clittle ginger bauble\u201d was chef\u2019s kiss) and genuine relatability. Maintaining knicker-swinging energy for an hour is no easy feat, but Gledhill gives it a fair crack.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets Flo & Joan starring George Fouracres | One Man Musical\n\nArts Centre Melbourne - Fairfax Studio, until April 20 Comedic duo Flo & Joan have built a show around the idea that nothing brings people together like hating Andrew Lloyd Webber. They\u2019re back this year with a 60-minute, high-energy tour of the man they describe as a legendary \u201ccockroach of the West End\u201d. Or, for legal reasons, a purely farcical one-man show about a random cat-loving narcissist who loves organ-heavy riffs and hating Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nThe show was a runaway hit at Edinburgh Fringe last year. Part-swansong, part-musical biopic, Flo & Joan fill the show to the brim with biographical details and melodic parodies of Webber\u2019s classic style. Meanwhile, actor George Fouracres plays a short-tempered and entitled Webber, sitting on a throne dressed in purple velvet as he swings from the self-obsessed showstopper, All About Me, to nostalgic ballads mourning his glory days. One Man Musical is on at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. Moments that parodied Webber stood out over those that simply recounted his life. One scene, backed by bubble machines and technicolour lighting, married creative pastiche and biography spectacularly. But the show ultimately struggles to make the leap from Fringe venue to the Arts Centre\u2019s Fairfax Studio. Loading Muted sound design left Fouracres out in the cold, making his high-octane delivery style seem overzealous and his high-pitched vocals like an attempt to overcompensate by yelling. It\u2019s a bit grating. But for that reason, maybe One Man Musical has perfectly captured what it might be like to spend an hour with this living legend \u2013 for better or for worse.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed Guy Webster\n\nJude Perl Tries To Finish A Sentence\n\nArts Centre Melbourne \u2013 The Show Room, until April 20 As the title of this show suggests, Jude Perl finds herself unable to say anything that doesn\u2019t upset someone and is hyper focused on using \u201ccorrect\u201d language when expressing herself. Hence, why she can\u2019t finish a sentence unless she\u2019s belting out tunes on her piano. Jude Perl Tries To Finish A Sentence is at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. There\u2019s something interesting to be said about the age of moral outrage we\u2019re currently in and the polarised views that rest on either end of the spectrum. But Perl\u2019s prevaricating show veers perilously close to embracing moral ambiguity at a time when crusades are being waged against \u201cwokeism\u201d and clear-eyed renunciations of injustice are being met with suppression. The framing of Perl\u2019s show is such, but the scaffolding is weak as well. Perl inhabits different characters \u2013 a sentence mentor, an uncouth best man at a wedding, a cancelled pop star of yesteryears \u2013 to express the difficulty of forming a thought in the oversaturated world we live in and the corrosive power of nostalgia.",

        "text": "Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s weaker economy coupled with the Treasury\u2019s razor-thin headroom leaves the UK exposed to a \u201cnegative spiral\u201d similar to Greece\u2019s debt meltdown a decade ago, according to one of the world\u2019s biggest investment firms. Neil Robson, the head of global equities at Columbia Threadneedle, said Britain\u2019s \u00a32.8 trillion ($6 trillion) debt pile, which nearly outstrips the size of the economy, leaves it vulnerable as Trump\u2019s tariffs increase the risk of a global recession. Robson said: \u201cWe have had a Liz Truss moment here in the UK. Could we have a Labour version of that? Possibly. I think it\u2019s quite likely.\u201d He said Britain\u2019s current financial situation mirrored the lead-up to the eurozone meltdown when bond markets turned aggressively against Greece when investors suddenly realised the country could not balance its books.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you think about the problem of being very indebted, you can be as indebted as you like as long as your nominal growth is higher than your interest rate.\u201d \u201cBut if ever your nominal GDP growth stalls \u2013 not just on a temporary basis \u2013 below your interest costs then you\u2019re in a real negative spiral, and it can move really quickly. We saw that with Greece during the great financial crisis.\u201d British Chancellor Rachel Reeves had banked on faster economic growth to offset the UK\u2019s rising debt bill over the next five years, but an expected economic slump from The the US president\u2019s trade war has left that plan in tatters. Trump slapped a flat 10 per cent tariff on all nations, rising to as high as 50 per cent for the worst off. Although Britain escaped with the flat 10 per cent rate, its exposure to the global economy means growth forecasts are likely to be pared back and could trigger a crisis for UK debt, known as gilts, which are bought and sold by global investors.\n\n\u2018Double blow\u2019 for Britain Bruno Schneller, the managing partner at Erlen Capital Management, warned that the bond markets could turn against the UK if investors lose faith in Reeves\u2019s economic plan. Loading \u201c Trump\u2019s tariff blitz risks triggering a global stagflation shock \u2013 and for the UK, that\u2019s a recipe for a gilt crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cSlower growth, higher inflation and a jittery investor base could combine to push UK borrowing costs higher at the worst possible time. This isn\u2019t just trade war fallout; it\u2019s the kind of external shock that can crack already fragile debt markets.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs could deal a double blow to the UK \u2013 stalling global growth while fuelling inflation. That\u2019s a nightmare for any chancellor trying to stabilise debt. If markets lose confidence in the UK\u2019s fiscal path, a gilt sell-off isn\u2019t just possible \u2013 it\u2019s probable.\u201d It follows a dramatic week for the global economy after the scale of Trump\u2019s tariffs blitz caught markets by surprise. The turmoil also prompted JP Morgan to raise the risk of global recession this year to 60 per cent from 40 per cent as investor panic rattled stock markets around the world. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the US president\u2019s tariff increases were \u201csignificantly larger than expected\u201d. Credit: AP Although UK gilts have been boosted so far by Trump\u2019s tariffs, investors have warned this could soon change.\n\n\u201cIf Trump doesn\u2019t course-correct, this crisis will affect many different areas in global markets,\u201d said Harald Berlinicke, a partner at Sarnia Asset Management. Risk of more tax rises The gloomy message comes shortly after the chancellor slashed welfare benefits to restore \u00a39.9 billion of fiscal headroom at the Spring Statement. The Office for Budget Responsibility warned that in a worst-case scenario, a full-blown trade war risked wiping out all the margin of error she had left herself against her fiscal rules. This means that after a record \u00a340 billion tax-raising budget in October, Reeves may be forced to come back for more tax increases in her autumn Budget. Trump has vowed to persist with his aggressive tariffs despite last week\u2019s market bloodbath, insisting \u201cit\u2019s going very well\u201d and that the economy is \u201chealing\u201d.\n\nLoading The turmoil would be \u201csomething we are going to remember for a very long time\u201d, Robson said. \u201cRisks of recession have clearly gone up. I don\u2019t see why there won\u2019t be a recession at the moment. It\u2019s difficult to see what the solution is unless America walks back on this,\u201d he said. Some of the world\u2019s most important financial leaders have warned Trump that his aggressive trade policies will wreak havoc by depressing growth and fuelling inflation. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said on Friday that the president\u2019s tariff increases were \u201csignificantly larger than expected\u201d and so the same would \u201clikely be true of the economic effects\u201d.",

She\u2019s 71 years old, 160 centimetres tall, and exuberant as hell in blue-green hair, blasting through a recorder solo before chucking the instrument offstage. Cyndi Lauper performs at Rod Laver Arena, April 2, 2025. Credit: Martin Philbey The crowd are in tulle skirts, glitter and colourful wigs, which are on sale in the foyer \u2013 the money goes to her charity, Girls Just Wanna Have Fundamental Rights. Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. She still has a voice like a box of crayons, bright, messy, and expressive. She uses everything, with soaring vibrato, sometimes audibly out of breath, imprecise and alive. The set is \u201980s-heavy, leaning most on her \u201983 debut She\u2019s So Unusual, with some middle-of-the-road \u201990s stuff and, to my delight, the song she did for The Goonies thrown in.\n\nIt\u2019s a talky night. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bang-bang show,\u201d she says unapologetically in her irresistible Brooklyn drawl (\u201cIt\u2019s a paww-deee!\u201d). She tells us about family, the cousin who had a pigeon coop on her roof, the women who raised her and the way they\u2019d cut up old clothes and make something brand new with them. She does the same with her art, of course. Many of her songs are written by others but she makes them utterly her own. She tells us she recorded I Drove All Night, written for Roy Orbison, because there were no songs on the radio about women driving. \u201cWhen you get in the car and you can drive anywhere you freakin\u2019 want, that\u2019s a power song.\u201d Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. Credit: Martin Philbey She cycles through about half-a-dozen costume changes, each with a different hair colour: sparkly, shoulder-padded jackets, asymmetrical suits, underwear on the outside, a floor-length Norma Desmond number, a red jacket with a bright yellow wig. \u201cI tried to dress up faw ya,\u201d she says. As this outfit\u2019s designer Christian Siriano told her: \u201cThe gays want glamour.\u201d For the evergreen Time After Time, Melbourne\u2019s Tones and I joins for a duet that\u2019s like every wedding dance floor you\u2019ve ever been on: messy and beautiful. And she delivers True Colours flawlessly, standing on a small satellite stage in the middle of the arena with a long rainbow scarf metres in the air.\n\nFor the finale, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, she\u2019s joined by The Veronicas, who sink into the background in a stage designed in polka-dot tribute to artist Yayoi Kusama. Even this, her signature tune, is a cover of a late-\u201970s pop-punk number, sung by a man, but I defy you to listen to that original and think of it as anything less than a sketch for Lauper to colour in and make something wonderful, defiant and punch-the-air fun.\n\nReviewed by Will Cox DANCE\n\nPoesis and The Bastard \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 5 The latest Dancehouse double bill features two works that differ wildly in their commitments to technique and virtuosity, but which together make for an invigorating and provoking evening of dance theatre. Gabriella Imrichova\u2019s cheekily titled The Bastard aims to challenge expectations with a surprising blend of theatre, performance art and only little dance. It\u2019s a bit punk and a bit mongrel, but consistently funny.\n\nThis is a performance in two halves. First, we get a dry parody of non-dance, a somewhat dated form of experimental dance in which movement is withheld: it\u2019s slow and repetitious and very low effort. Loading Either side of this performance, Imrichova addresses the audience, simulating apprehension about its reception: about whether it fits the context and whether it works as dance. It\u2019s mischievous but not without charm. Then follows a wild rant about art and novelty. There were a few walkouts on opening night, but that\u2019s surely a victory for an artist who declares that trolling is a creative practice. Prue Lang\u2019s Poesis sits more securely within the conventions of contemporary dance. It\u2019s a duet in which the two dancers generate striking compositions from subtle contrasts in form, line and intention.",

        "text": "Glow in the dark paint has already been trialled on roads in two Aussie states, and one business would love to see it 'everywhere'.\n\nAustralia has an extensive road network that reaches some of the most isolated places in the world. But if you're one of the many 4WD or caravan adventurers or have been on a long road trip, you'll know first-hand that some of our most important roads aren't as well lit as they should be.\n\nThis fact prompted Transport for NSW to trial a new technology on a notoriously dangerous highway in a bid to increase driver safety and help motorists \"better see line markings\" in areas with low visibility.\n\nNow, pioneers in the road industry believe that the glow-in-the-dark technology could be used on roads, footpaths, bike paths, helicopter landing pads and air strips in a bid to improve visibility and safety.\n\nClive Todd, founder of Lihten, told Yahoo News that after having a serious car accident, he was compelled to work to improve safety on roads across the world. He'd like to see innovative glow paint used \"anywhere and everywhere\" it could improve safety.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I want it to be in the key places which would help save lives,\" he told Yahoo. But it's \"not about wanting to sell a lot of glow paint\", he said. \"It needs to be in the right places and for the right objective.\"\n\nNSW is trialling glow-in-the-dark road lines along a notoriously dangerous stretch of highway south of Sydney. Source: Supplied/TfNSW\n\nMost dangerous time to drive on roads is at night\n\nResearch conducted by the Federal Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) showed that 1,300 people died on Australian roads in 2024 \u2014 up from 1,258 in 2023. The most dangerous time to be driving is, at night. Between the hours of 7:00pm \u2013 10:00pm as 34 per cent of deaths occur during this time.\n\nWith authorities hoping to achieve the ambitious goal of achieving zero deaths and serious injuries by 2050, drastic action needs to be taken.\n\nTodd believes the luminescent paint could be the answer. \"It's environmentally friendly, it saves electricity and it could save people's lives,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe was inspired to develop the idea after being asked to work on a footpath project in Saudi Arabia. After extensive research, he found a supplier in France, and has already implemented the paint, known as LuminoKrom, on a footpath and bike path in Blacktown, Sydney.\n\nA chemical in the paint makes it glow after being activated by sunlight. Todd likens it to the chemicals inside fireflies or glow worms that make them glow in the dark.\n\nOne drawback, however, is that it is costly to implement. \"Some people say it\u2019s expensive, I say it\u2019s high value,\" said Todd. He believes there would be \"significant advantages\" to the paint being used not only on roads and footpaths but also on helicopter landing pads, on the tops of emergency vehicles, as well as on outback airstrips used by the RFDS.\n\nWhere in Australia are there glow-in-the-dark roads?\n\nIt comes after Victoria conducted a similar trial in 2022, with the line markings added to a 1km section of Metong Road in the state's southeast in May by Tarmac Linemarking, in collaboration with OmniGrip and Vic Roads. But back in July of this year, a VicRoads spokesperson told Yahoo the experiment was discontinued.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey said an independent evaluation conducted once the trial had concluded determined there was insufficient road safety benefits to justify adding more of the fluro lines to the state's roads, effectively axing any hope of the $4 million scheme being rolled out further.\n\nIn New South Wales, the Bulli Pass trial uses the glow-in-the-dark thermoplastic feature on a small stretch of road, with insiders 'excited' to see its benefits.\n\n\"Being able to see the shape of the road ahead is critical to safe driving and that\u2019s what Glow Roads do,\" NSW's Minister for Roads John Graham said. \"Data shows around a third of fatal crashes in NSW happen at night. If this trial is deemed a success, we will look at its application on other locations with a history of crashes or near-misses where better visibility is needed. The trial is nearly over \u2014 with many waiting with bated breath to see the results.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Hundreds and thousands of Aussies were in stitches after watching an apprentice's bold move at Bunnings.\n\nA cheeky trend emerging in Bunnings stores has prompted the hardware giant to weigh in. Source: TikTok/Getty\n\nA tradie and his apprentice have started a cheeky trend in Bunnings stores across the country, prompting the hardware giant to weigh in.\n\nDescribing it as a \"bit of harmless fun\", Brad, owner of decking and landscaping company HC Urban shared a video encouraging others to play Jenga with a pallet of timber at his local store in Perth.\n\nHe told Yahoo News that after sharing a video of an apprentice poking a piece of timber out of the middle of the pile and putting it on top, he was inundated with \"countless\" pictures and videos by people \"having a laugh\" by following suit.\n\nThe trend started after an off-the-cuff comment telling his apprentice that the pile of timber looked like a \"big Jenga set\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It progressed from that,\" he told Yahoo. \"We\u2019ve been doing it for a while but thought let\u2019s make it [video] and see if everyone else can get around it for a bit of harmless fun,\" he said.\n\n\"Knowing that all Bunnings have the same layout, [we thought] hopefully everyone can join in the fun.'\n\nHundreds and thousands of Aussies who have seen the video have reacted to the funny scene, and while some couldn't wait to get to their local hardware store to give it a try, others said they've been told off for being caught doing it.\n\nBunnings weighs in on Jenga trend\n\nWhile Bunnings Director of Stores, Rod Caust, said he \"loves\" to see people having fun in stores, \"stacking timber like a giant Jenga tower isn\u2019t quite what we had in mind.\"\n\n\"The safety of our team and customers is our number one priority, so we can\u2019t support anything that puts anyone at risk,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We ask our customers to keep the Jenga battles to the backyard, but if you need timber for a project \u2014 or a DIY Jenga tower \u2014 our team is always happy to help you stack it safely.\"\n\nHardware giant 'highly sought after' tactics to attract tradies\n\nIt was recently suggested Bunnings uses a clever tactic to lay out its stores, with one shopper noticing that some are designed \"in the order\" of building a house. \"It starts with timber, and then we go to plumbing, then flooring, electrical and then paint and landscaping,\" she said, adding that they are \"all in the order that you would do things\".\n\nAnother little-known perk sees Bunnings offer tradies a special breakfast targeted at their most loyal customers. Electrical apprentice Eleanor Gleeson previously told Yahoo News Australia that attending the breakfast is a \"rite of passage\" for those who work in trades and the merchandise handed out as freebies is \"highly sought after\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Trade breakfasts are a morning event where they have free breakfast and coffees for tradies,\" the New Zealander told Yahoo, adding that it's also a chance to grab some merch and chat with suppliers and other tradies in the industry.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
