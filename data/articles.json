It all happened so quickly,\" it quoted him as saying in an interview at the hospital where he was being treated.\n\nREAD MORE: The girl who fell 3km from a plane explosion and survived\n\nParts of an Air India plane that crashed on Thursday are seen on top of a building in Ahmedabad, India, Friday, June 13, 2025 (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nHe said he had been visiting family and was returning to the UK with his brother, who had been sitting in a different row. He didn't know if his brother had survived, he said.\n\nAir India later confirmed that of the 242 people on board the flight, 241 had died, making Ramesh the sole survivor.\n\nHis cousin Ajay Valgi told reporters in Leicester, England, that Ramesh had called his family to tell them he's \"fine,\" adding that they were upset about his brother and all of the others who died.\n\nA doctor told CNN that Ramesh's condition was \"not very critical\" and that he could be released in the next couple of days.\n\n\"He has some blood in the images, but he's not very badly injured.

        "text": "In an unassuming rural hamlet, two hours' drive south-east of Melbourne, a little country pub is growing a big reputation as a popular live music venue in regional Victoria.\n\nNestled between the rustic cliffs of Bass Coast and South Gippsland's dairy farms and green, rolling hills, Archies Creek is a village of 16 houses, a pub, a hall, a telephone booth, a junkyard and an evangelical church.\n\nOutdoor lawn and seating areas around the music stage create a relaxed festival atmosphere. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nHaving run venues for 20 years, most famously the Caravan Music Club in Melbourne, tree-changers Peter Foley, and his partner Mary Howlett moved to Archies Creek six years ago, buying the Archies Creek Hotel.\n\nRedecorating the venue with an intimate cabaret lounge, the once sleepy pub was re-imagined with an inner Melbourne rock'n'roll pub vibe and a touch of laid-back country bohemia.\n\nQuiz nights, poetry readings, life drawing classes and movie nights are held at the pub. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nThe Archies Creek Hotel has since become a pivotal meeting place for locals, frequented by a largely mature crowd seeking nostalgic outings, new cultural experiences and community connections.\n\n\n\n\"It's a different kind of venue, there's just an energy about the place,\" publican Peter Foley said.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for people to gather and celebrate music and community.\"\n\nAn outdoor stage built during the COVID pandemic enabled the hotel to host large concerts during summer. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\n\" Everybody wants to play here, local and even international musicians love playing here because it's a little trip to somewhere else. \"\n\nWith a mailing list of 18,000, the Archies Creek Hotel runs movies every Thursday night, live music from Friday to Sunday as well as comedy and quiz nights, choral singing, life-drawing classes, spoken word and poetry readings.\n\n\"This venue can be anything \u2014 it's a chameleon venue, because it's outdoors, it's a bit rustic, it's a bit odd, and it works with any type of music and it's in the middle of nowhere, but it still works,\" Mr Foley said.\n\nGreg Walker of Machine Translations performing at Archies Creek. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nA mix of old and new\n\nVeteran radio broadcaster, semi-professional musician and civil celebrant Jon Von Goes moved to Archies Creek as part of Peter and Mary's campaign to re-populate the town with \"music types\".\n\nJon Von Goes and partner Celia Church host quiz nights at the pub and perform as duo Jonnie goes to Church. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nLiving within stumbling distance of the pub, he has since become the unofficial \"captain\" of the Archies Creek Arts Council that curates a calendar of music and arts events to keep the pub and district parishioners entertained.\n\n\n\nRecent set lists have included The Models, Weddings Parties Anything and You Am I.\n\nMr Von Goes says people are still buying merchandise at gigs such as vinyl records and tea towels. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\n\"The most popular gigs are the people who had hits in the 70s, Ross Wilson, Jo Camilleri and James Reyne,\" Mr Von Goes said.\n\n\"They're great gigs because they're established professionals who are great show people,\" he said, recalling a visit by some retired Phillip Island surfers who hugged and cried through a performance of Girls on the Avenue, when Richard Clapton recently played.\n\n\" People come to remember their golden years, when they were falling in love for the first time. \"\n\nNostalgia is a pull factor for music lovers. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nKeeping the show going\n\nDespite the altruistic intentions of owner Peter Foley and the local community's strong appetite for music and arts, balancing the books remains an ongoing struggle with ever increasing costs, including an annual $45,000 insurance bill.\n\nWith the hotel almost hitting financial breaking point last year, Mr Foley turned to the public for help, calling out for subscribers to pay a $30 annual membership fee, in exchange for priority access to tickets and member discounts.\n\nArchies Creek Hotel held 60 events over the summer. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas )\n\n\"Rather than seeking government support, we've gone to the community, and we've had an incredible response because people love the place and they wanted to support it, because there's a bit of a cultural vacuum down here,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"As soon as we put it out there that we were seeking community support, it came in abundance \u2014 we've had 1,041 people join up so far.\"\n\nHe believes the community subscription model is a much more direct and efficient means of generating funds than applying for grants, and could be applied to venues facing similar challenges across Australia.\n\n\"I actually think it's a viable model for sustaining a venue, if younger people really took possession of it,\" Mr Foley said.\n\nCommunity subscribers pay an annual membership fee, keeping the venue's doors open. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nWith three residences on the property, the venue also offers space for songwriter retreats and rehearsal camps.\n\n\"It's a business, but it's a community business, it's not like there is an emphasis on just being a pub \u2014 there has always been a vibe and a community \u2014 we're in the happiness business,\" Mr Foley said.\n\nThe Archies Creek Hotel is decorated with vintage album covers and bill posters. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nNow in his mid-60s, and getting beyond the late nights of the \"hospo grind\", the relentless physical work of running a bar and the 7am trips to the tip to recycle countless empty bottles, Mr Foley is looking for someone to run the bar and kitchen or a new owner to take gradual possession of the venue over time.\n\n\"I still love the place and I want it to keep going and I'm happy to guide anybody who has got any energy to deal with the physical work,\" he said.\n\nMr Foley has transformed the Archies Creek Hotel into a thriving music venue in the space of six years. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\n\"It's not a business that you can make a lot of money out of, but you make enough to survive.\n\n\"We have a holiday every year and we have a lot of fun \u2014 it depends what you define as success really.\n\n\"It feels like you're doing something decent and worthwhile, but if it was just about the money, you wouldn't do it.\"",

They are 155 kilogram wooden, hand-built coastal rowing boats called St Ayle's skiffs, also known as skiffies.\n\nThey can be traced back to the 19th century mining communities of the famous Scottish town of Fife.\n\nAnd the rowers aren't your run-of-the-mill athletes \u2014 they are Australia's representatives at the World Championships taking part on Scotland's south-west coast in July.\n\nRowing brings a smile to Endersby's face. (ABC News: Tom Wildie)\n\n\"We're now taking 16 rowers over to to Scotland. We are all over 50 and the age range goes up to 79,\" said Mark Endersby, the club's skiff race director.\n\n\"This is male, female and mixed.

        "text": "Tens of millions of dollars levied from developers in one of Melbourne's largest suburbs to be used for local infrastructure is set to be spent in other communities by the City of Wyndham, infuriating residents of Point Cook.\n\nThe decision by the council to allow $24 million in developer contributions to be spent elsewhere in the municipality has also prompted a state government MP to call for integrity agencies to probe decision making.\n\nWhen new housing estates are built, developers make contributions to council with the money to go towards infrastructure.\n\nLast year it was revealed council had $36 million in Point Cook developer contributions, raised two decades ago, sitting in council accounts.\n\nLocals seized on the news, demanding their suburb \u2014 home to 70,000 people \u2014 receive the money for infrastructure, such as basketball courts or an aquatic centre.\n\nCouncil used a third for a community centre in the suburb, but a majority of councillors then allocated $24.4 million for a community space somewhere in Wyndham.\n\n\"If we look at this ethically, it doesn't pass the pub test '' Point Cook resident Dwayne Kelly said.\n\nHe started an online petition to pressure the council to look after the suburb, which has fallen on deaf ears.\n\nPoint Cook resident Dwayne Kelly says he started a petition to pressure the council on its spending. (ABC News)\n\n\"This is really wrong. A lot of the community probably didn't know \u2026 so I wanted to create awareness, to say this is happening, this what our council are doing to us, and it's not right,'' he said.\n\nLocals say sports infrastructure is lacking\n\nBasketball is popular in the region but indoor courts for competition are scarce.\n\nFamilies have to travel across Melbourne's west to find a place to play. It's caused leagues to turn away players, shorten games to accommodate so many teams and create extra byes to fit everyone in.\n\n\"It's ridiculous,'' Kate Coffey of the Altona Basketball Association said.\n\n\" We just don't have the court space and there's lots of kids from Wyndham coming here. \"\n\nState Labor MP for Point Cook Mat Hilakari said council was aware of the need for sporting infrastructure in the suburb but had failed to fix the problem.\n\n\"Wyndham Council says that Point Cook requires the equivalent of 12 indoor basketball courts.

Are these decisions being made formally or informally by a majority councillor-grouping to carve up these funds?\" Mr Hilakari said in parliament in April.\n\n\"We will not know, because we will not be told.\n\n\"There are agencies to look into this, and they should \u2014 the Local Government Inspectorate, council monitors, the Victorian Ombudsman and more.\"\n\nCouncil says accusations are 'false and misleading'\n\nCouncil has bristled at the suggestion of poor behaviour, writing to local government minister Nick Staikos saying it was concerning Mr Hilakari was using parliamentary privilege to \"pedal misinformation and lies for a political attack that seeks to undermine community trust in council\".\n\nWyndham City says it has no legal obligation to spend the money collected in Point Cook in the suburb and any suggestion to the contrary was \"false and misleading\".\n\nWyndham Mayor Mia Shaw said council was focused on exploring opportunities for a major regional community events space.\n\nCity of Wyndham mayor Mia Shaw says her council is focusing on a major regional community events space.

(ABC News)\n\nThe state opposition's special representative on the western suburbs Moira Deeming said it set a terrible precedent and eroded trust in governance.\n\n\"I don't think it passes the pub test.

        "text": "Who\u2019s not: Noah Balta owes his club big time. Just two months after signing a mammoth seven-year contract extension, the key defender assaulted a man in a NSW car park. As a result of the club-imposed sanction and the curfew ordered by the magistrate, Balta has played just five out of 13 games in a season when the Tigers need his experience. It\u2019s a big final three months of the season for Dion Prestia, who has managed only 15 of 36 games since the start of last year due to a series of injuries. The 32-year-old won\u2019t be part of the Tigers\u2019 next finals team but can play an important buffering role while prized picks Sam Lalor and Josh Smillie cut their teeth at the top level. The verdict: As tough as it may be for Tigers fans to watch their side lose most weeks, even the harshest judge would be encouraged by the progress made so early in their rebuild. While the exodus of mature-age talent was supposed to result in the reigning wooden-spooner plumbing deeper lows, the arrival of fresh blood who actually want to be there has seen the Tigers already improve on their two wins. With games to come against Essendon, West Coast (away), St Kilda and North Melbourne, they should be able to pick up another one or two wins to nourish the soul without much damage to their draft hand. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: C+ Gold Coast Suns (5th, 8 wins, 4 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Well, it\u2019s finally getting hot for the Suns where it really counts \u2013 on the ladder. They are primed to play finals for the first time in club history \u2013 but, yes, we have said that before, and a challenging run home to September awaits. This time, though, Damien Hardwick has his team playing a robust brand of football that should stand up when it counts. New skipper Noah Anderson is in All-Australian form, while Matt Rowell has added more run to his game. The Suns are giving Rowell time to sign a contract extension, but it\u2019s a major worry the Victorian, with several suitors, has yet to do so. Perhaps that changes soon after the bye. Touk Miller is another midfielder pressing for All-Australian selection, while defender Sam Collins and mid-sized forward Ben Long would be locks for that team were it picked now. Key forward Ben King would also be close. Recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble have done what was expected \u2013 provide dash and creativity from halfback.\n\nOn our way: Matt Rowell and Ben King have had strong starts to the season, helping the Suns eye a maiden finals berth. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: Half-back flanker Connor Budarick has been in and out of the team and has not played at the senior level since the loss to the Lions. While Rioli and Noble enjoy the rebound accolades in defensive 50, a firing Budarick would also help. As Hardwick has noted, the Suns need to stop kicking to King when he is outnumbered. King had 23 goals in his first six games, the 24-year-old has 10 in his past six games. It\u2019s over to Ethan Read, Jed Walter and Ned Moyle to get busy. The verdict: The Suns likely need only five more wins to book a September berth, but face a potentially tough month after the break \u2013 GWS [Engie Stadium], Melbourne [People First Stadium], Essendon [Marvel Stadium] and Collingwood [People First Stadium]. Richmond [in round 21] appears their only certain win in the run home, but if they are good enough, they will make the finals. Their game plan is strong \u2013 they are among the best teams for points from turnovers, intercepts and stoppages, and know how to lock the ball inside their forward-half. It\u2019s about time the Suns broke their finals duck \u2013 we\u2019re backing Hardwick in. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: B Sydney (13th, 5 wins, 8 losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Twelve months ago, the Swans were flag favourites and Isaac Heeney the top pick to win the Brownlow. That\u2019s not the case now, but Heeney remains their best-performed player. The gun midfielder is on track for similar numbers to his career-best 2024 but is lacking the same impact. The same could be said of Chad Warner, whose form has improved since the distraction of being out of contract was removed. Tagger James Jordon can count midfield stars Sam Walsh and Zach Merrett among his scalps. Youngster Matt Roberts continues to grow as a running defender, backing up his rapid improvement from last year. Who\u2019s not: An All Australian halfback last year, Nick Blakey is struggling with the extra attention on him. Injuries have forced the Swans to play him deeper, limiting his capacity to provide the springboard from defence that was a feature of their game last year. Ollie Florent paid the price for the Swans\u2019 poor form, his recent omission ending a run of 130 consecutive games. Hayden McLean is another from their grand final team who has also been dropped this year as the Swans search for marking power in their weakened forward line. Now that he is fit after a wretched 18 months with injury, skipper Callum Mills has the chance in the second half of the season to remind his critics why the club made him captain. Verdict: Injuries have wreaked havoc with rookie coach Dean Cox\u2019s first season at the helm. All Australians Errol Gulden, Tom Papley, Mills have all spent chunks of the season injured, as have reliable defender Harry Cunningham and young key forward Logan McDonald. Throw them all into the Swans\u2019 23, and it\u2019s unlikely they would be in such a desperate position. The crowded casualty ward has exposed a lack of depth. That said, the Swans have been so poor in several games that it would not have mattered who they had on the park. A fitter list raises hope they can mount a charge for the finals, but they are coming from a long way back. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport are sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter.\n\nTeams who had the bye in round 13 St Kilda (11th, five wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nJack Higgins has been a consistent force up forward, the small forward leading the Saints\u2019 goal kicking \u2013 including four goals against Geelong \u2013 to be included in the All-Australian preliminary squad. Jack Sinclair (27 disposals per game) and Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera (28) have been two of the premier rebounding half-backs. The dashing Wanganeen-Milera, off-contract and weighing up offers to return home to South Australia, has become the Saints\u2019 most important player, and the best player they have had in the past decade. That he has yet to agree to a contract extension by this point of the season is a major worry for the Saints. Former Western Bulldog Jack Macrae has been a strong leader through the midfield and found plenty of the ball (before a major lung injury), while intercept defender Callum Wilkie should be in All-Australian squad discussions. Youngster Hugo Garcia is making progress, despite a public spray from Ross Lyon during the loss to Brisbane and recent axing to the VFL. Marcus Windhager, one of several off-contract Saints, has, at times, been a stand-out, whether tagging or finding his own ball. Cookin\u2019: Jack Higgins has had a strong season, and will be in All-Australian squad calculations. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Who\u2019s not?\n\nYoung midfielder Darcy Wilson has stagnated, while Mattaes Phillipou has endured an injury-hit start to the season, the latest a calf injury in the opening minutes against Melbourne. Wingman Brad Hill still provides dash, but there are times when he could rip a game open. Rowan Marshall has been steady, but is no longer among the conversation as one of the top three ruckmen in the league. Injuries to Max King and Zaine Cordy have hurt.\n\nVerdict: The Saints are 2-4 against top-eight teams, including their best win of the season, against Geelong. They are a system-based side, so, when the system wobbles, the whole team wobbles, which can lead to heavy defeats. The flip side is what we saw against Melbourne, when they dominated through scores from defence. That they are the only team to lose to the last-placed Eagles highlights the gulf between their worst and best. The Saints still remain a line-ball finals contender, as they were before this campaign began. Through that prism, they sit where many had expected. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: C+ Man on a mission: Caleb Serong has been influential for the Dockers this season. Credit: AFL Photos Fremantle (eighth, seven wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nMidfield gun Caleb Serong (28 disposals per game) typically finds plenty of the ball, but has struggled, at times, when there has been an aggressive tag. Fellow star onballer Andrew Brayshaw (also 28 disposals per game) has been busy, and put his body on the line in the desperate final minutes against Gold Coast on Saturday, and is also firmly in contention for All-Australian selection. Jordan Clark has provided drive from half-back, Shai Bolton has added life inside attacking 50 and been arguably the second-best recruit of the season (behind Bailey Smith), while Luke Jackson has been at his best when used as a sole ruckman. The Dockers have been one of the more efficient teams, according to Champion Data, but need to find more marks inside 50 if they are to challenge for a top-four spot.\n\nLoading Who\u2019s not?\n\nSean Darcy, tied to the club until the end of 2030, has largely been a shadow of his former self because of an off-season hampered by a knee issue but was strong in ruck contests in the wet against the Suns. Whether he and Jackson can thrive in the same team remains a burning question for coach Justin Longmuir. It also remains to be seen if talls Josh Treacy, Jye Amiss and Pat Voss can consistently also work alongside each other up forward, as the Dockers have struggled to turn inside-50 advantage into scores. That could also be because of a lack of speed with ball in hand, something the Dockers have looked to address. It was great to see Nat Fyfe back for his first senior game of the season last weekend. Hayden Young\u2019s extended absence because of a serious hamstring injury which has required surgery has hurt. He shapes as an x-factor later in the season. Verdict: The Dockers remain an enigma. They have a list capable of finishing in the top four, reinforced by their win on the Gold Coast and their three wins in five games against top-eight teams, but have had head-shaking losses, including a 61-point defeat to St Kilda at Marvel Stadium, and a 14-point loss at home to a depleted Collingwood. The pressure remains on Longmuir to deliver a deep finals run. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: B- Teams who had the bye in round 12\n\nCarlton (12th, four wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nIn his 10th season, Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in his new role as a defender. Silvagni\u2019s ability to stop high-quality forwards, from a key type like Aaron Naughton to the medium-sized threat like Patrick Dangerfield, intercept and launch counter-attacks is one of the reasons why the Blues, for all their problems, has been one of the more difficult sides to score against. A streamlined George Hewett is having a career-best season in the midfield at the age of 29, and Nick Haynes has overcome a horror start to life as a Blue by turning the clock back to the pre-pandemic years. Tom De Koning was the best ruck in the competition in the first month, but his form has tailed off. Jacob Weitering had been in All-Australian form before two below-par games coming into the bye. Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in defence for the Blues so far this season. Credit: AFL Photos Who\u2019s not?\n\nThe Blues need more from their superstars. Patrick Cripps and Charlie Curnow are having reasonable years but are capable of finding another level. Harry McKay has struggled with consistency since returning from a mental health break, though his best has been the reason why the Blues have won. After another interrupted preseason, Sam Walsh has become just a player, unable to run opponents off their legs like he used to. The same can be said of Blake Acres, who is not having the same impact of his first two years at the club. Verdict: So much more was expected of the Blues, who have been one of the most disappointing clubs of the season. Despite having two Coleman medallists in their forward line the Blues are having enormous difficulties scoring. Their lack of class small forwards has hurt, but their ball movement is slow and imprecise. They are as tense as a patient visiting the dentist. Similar problems were overcome in 2023 when they mounted a stunning run to the preliminary final, but they do not have the same quality on their list. A friendly draw over the next month will give Blues fans hope but a finals berth is unlikely.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Tristan Xerri is mounting a case for All-Australian selection this year. Credit: Getty Images North Melbourne (17th, two wins, one draw, eight losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Tristan Xerri is again mounting a strong claim for a maiden All-Australian blazer. The ruckman, with his attack on the ball and wholehearted manner in which he plays, has become the Kangaroos\u2019 on-field spiritual leader. Small forward Paul Curtis has continued his improvement and, with 19 goals to the bye, is on track to pass his career-best haul of 30 last year. Cameron Zurhaar has rediscovered his bull-at-a-gate ways in attack to add much-needed bite to the forward line. Veteran Luke Parker has justified his acquisition on the field even if his greatest impact might be felt in the locker room. Who\u2019s not?\n\nThis might be harsh on North\u2019s leading possession-getter but Caleb Daniel is not having the impact he should. A damaging kick at his best, Daniel has often erred on the side of recklessness with his ball use by taking low-percentage options deep in defence. In his third year at Arden Street, Griffin Logue cannot get a clear run at it due to injury and now form. Dropped amid North\u2019s horror run, Logue is yet to reclaim his position in the side. The Roos need more from experienced duo Aidan Corr and Zac Fisher, who have both had stints in the VFL.\n\nCaleb Daniel: Plenty of possessions but more impact needed. Credit: Getty Images Verdict: As painful as this season has been for their fans, North have actually improved. At this stage last year, they were winless with a percentage of 55.9 and uncompetitive. This year, they have been in contention at three-quarter-time in eight games. The question is whether North should be further advanced after five seasons in the bottom two. Given they have traded away their first pick, the Kangaroos would have expected to have picked up an extra win or two instead of being in the familiar position of 17th. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Port Adelaide (15th, four wins, seven losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot?\n\nPort\u2019s best phase of the season came after Zak Butters returned from injury. Butters was instrumental in Port\u2019s best win of the year, against Hawthorn, but needs more help in the guts. The Power cannot afford to lose him. Moved to half-back, Connor Rozee has maintained his high standards while others\u2019 have fallen, though Port need him in the middle as well as providing run out of defence. Though not necessarily built for it, Mitch Georgiades has prospered being the main man in the forward 50. Miles Bergman\u2019s star is on the rise though he, like Butters, may be on the move at season\u2019s end. Who\u2019s not?\n\nEsava Ratugolea, Ivan Soldo, and Jordon Sweet were recruited at the end of 2023 to help Port take the next step. Eighteen months on, those moves have not had the desired effect. Ratugolea is struggling in an overworked defence that does not get enough pressure on the ball from up the field. Sweet lost his spot after being monstered by Tim English, and his understudy Soldo is out of favour. The move of Jeremy Finlayson into defence lasted just one disastrous game against Collingwood. Ed Richards has been a midfield weapon for the Western Bulldogs. Credit: Getty Images Verdict: Ken Hinkley\u2019s 13th and final season at the helm at Alberton is headed for an inglorious finish. Preliminary finalists last year, Port are headed for a bottom-six finish. The impending handover from Hinkley to Josh Carr is an easy target to explain Port\u2019s poor season even though many had tipped them to be this season\u2019s slider. The club would not have seen such a drop coming, given they traded out their first-round pick for Jack Lukosius, who has been injured. Most concerning is how quickly the Power have waved the white flag when things became difficult. Five of the heaviest losses of the Hinkley era have come in Port\u2019s last 24 games.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: E Western Bulldogs (seventh, six wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nEd Richards has morphed from a capable half-back into one of the game\u2019s best midfielders in the past 12 months. Richards\u2019 speed and penetrating left foot makes him a major weapon for the Dogs. Rebounding defender Bailey Dale, who had a career-best 49 possessions a fortnight ago, is on track for a second All-Australian blazer. Tom Liberatore is defying Father Time. Small forward Rhylee West is one of the most improved players in the league, thriving since taking over from the injured Cody Weightman. Matt Kennedy is close to the recruit of the year since his move from Carlton, revelling as a midfielder who can also be dangerous when moved forward. Who\u2019s not?\n\nVeteran defender Liam Jones has struggled after having his pre-season severely disrupted by a serious hamstring injury. He lost his place to former cricketer James O\u2019Donnell, who has performed admirably in the key defensive post alongside the rejuvenated Rory Lobb. Injuries threatened to derail the season. Marcus Bontempelli, Adam Treloar, Sam Darcy have all spent significant periods in a star-studded casualty ward at Whitten Oval, but all are either back or will return shortly after the bye for the Dogs\u2019 run to September.

        "text": "Homeowners hoping to reduce their power bills by installing solar panels are now considering whether new discounts for solar batteries will be worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1 July, the federal government's Cheaper Home Batteries Program will provide a 30 per cent discount on the upfront cost of installing eligible small-scale battery systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut homeowners like Victorian resident Lee Bolger, who invested in solar panels a few years ago, are now experiencing dramatic drops in their feed-in tariffs and are sceptical about the added benefit of batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeed-in tariffs \u2014 credits issued by energy retailers \u2014 allow solar owners to earn money for any unused electricity they generate, which is fed into the electricity grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rates vary across different states and electricity providers.\n\n\n\nAdam Corrigan, an energy efficiency expert and founder of Your Energy Friend, says each household is different, and there are many other energy-saving options to consider before spending thousands on solar and batteries.\n\n\n\nSolar disappointment\n\nBolger, who lives in the Victorian town of Great Western, says he installed 30 panels on his eight-bedroom home in March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe rents out rooms in his house to boarders and says they use a lot of electricity as they often have the air-conditioning and heating on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis 12-kilowatt system cost him $12,680 after rebates and other discounts, which he estimated he could recoup in around six years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the feed-in tariff at the time was around 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and now he only gets around 6 cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore drops are expected, with comparison website Finder saying the minimum rate for tariffs in Victoria will drop to 0.04 cents from 1 July, although better rates are available depending on the provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifteen years ago, they were as high as 60 cents.\n\n\n\nFeed-in tariff rates for solar panel owners can vary widely across different states and territories. Source: SBS News Bolger estimates his original feed-in tariff of 12c per kWh would have saved him around $1,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen combined with the estimated $1,000 worth of electricity he saves relying on energy generated from his own system, he receives a total benefit of $2,000 per year from his solar panels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the feed-in tariff drops to practically zero, the benefit from his panels will reduce to around $1000 a year, meaning the time Bolger would need to pay off his panels would almost double.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the experience has made him \"indifferent\" about the economic benefits of solar and he won't be recommending it to others.\n\n\n\nLee Bolger says he's now \"indifferent\" to the benefits of solar after his feed-in tariffs were reduced. Source: Supplied Bolger doesn't believe installing a battery will make a difference, because his solar panels won't generate enough excess energy to store \u2014 especially in winter when it's often raining and dark \u2014 to make the purchase worthwhile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My summer bills were ridiculously low. In winter, you will not generally get enough charge into the battery to make a big difference,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBattery discounts attractive for some but not others\n\nCorrigan says other households might be in a different position to Bolger, as the average NSW home only uses about 20kWh of electricity per day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW-based energy expert, who has a 1.5 kilowatt solar system, says he uses less than 10 kilowatt-hours a day, although his cooktop is powered by gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[For] most homes, a 10 kilowatt or 14 kilowatt battery will get you through the night easily,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, if you are cranking your air conditioner and you've got ducted air conditioning, it's probably only going to last you two, three hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrigan says batteries will work for some households and the new federal rebate does make the cost more affordable.\n\n\n\nA battery makes so much sense, because you can store that excess electricity you're generating in the middle of the day and then use it in the early evening.\n\nFinder has estimated the cost of a 10kWh battery could come down to between $6,713 \u2013 $8,904 due to the federal discount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Australia, the average household uses about 15 to 20kWh of electricity per day,\" a Finder spokesperson says.\n\n\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen looks at home battery systems during a visit to SolarHub in May. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch \"If most of your energy consumption is in the evening and you're paying a single electricity rate \u2014 let's use 32.34c per kWh as an average based on single-rate plans in our database \u2014 then with a 10kWh battery and using 80 per cent of its capacity, you could save about $850 a year,\" a Finder spokesperson says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, the actual savings can vary depending on the type of electricity plan you have, the rates you pay, your solar panel setup, your energy consumption patterns, and how much electricity you export back to the grid.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the federal battery discount applies nationally, the states and territories also have programs that can be used to further reduce the cost.\n\n\n\nLook at other options first\n\nCorrigan recommends considering other options before investing in expensive solar panels and battery systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe suggests Bolger should review his insulation and energy efficiency measures to reduce his electricity consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing he recommends for households is to analyse their power bills and shop around to get the best deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking your house more energy-efficient should be the next priority before considering solar panels and, finally, batteries.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your home more comfortable, get your insulation sorted and do your draft proofing. That's your best return on investment. That's your best bang for buck.\n\nCorrigan says simple changes such as installing heavy-lined curtains and a box pelmet (which goes around the top of the curtain) can be very effective at keeping your home warm, and are much cheaper than double-glazed windows, for example.\n\n\n\nHeavy curtains with a pelmet can be very effective in keeping your home warm. Source: Getty / Penpak Ngamsathain Using a thermal camera around the home can also show gaps in roof insulation where batteries might have been moved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You only need a 5 per cent gap in that insulation blanket, and the effectiveness of that insulation \u2014 the whole blanket \u2014 diminishes by almost a half,\" Corrigan says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you get into bed tonight and you pull the doona up, just cut some holes in it, see how well it works.\"\n\n\n\nCan you afford it?\n\nWhen considering whether to invest in a battery system, Corrigan says the first consideration is cost, as they are expensive and many people don't have the money sitting in the bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who already have a solar system should check whether their inverter is battery-compatible, as this could also raise warranty issues if it needs to be replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother consideration is what your next car will be.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australians are buying EVs even if they can't charge the cars at home\n\nCorrigan says in one to two years, electric vehicles will be capable of vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid functionality, allowing EV batteries to be used to power your home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people are already doing it,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are an attractive option because EV batteries generally have a huge capacity of around 50-70kWh.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Many Australians have some level of PFAS \u2014 often dubbed forever chemicals \u2014 in their body, but understanding their impacts and strategies for reducing them is lacking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, scientists and experts continued to give evidence to a federal inquiry investigating the regulation and management of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir remarks highlighted a series of knowledge gaps that make it difficult to ascertain the health impacts of these chemicals, which are present in our environment and bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also served as a reminder about one of the only known ways to reduce our levels.\n\n\n\nWhat are PFAS, and how common are they?\n\nPFAS are synthetic compounds found in a variety of industrial and consumer products, including makeup, non-stick cooking surfaces and food packaging, due to their heat, stain, grease and water-resistant properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have even been found across water filtration plants, with high contamination levels in Warragamba, North Richmond and the Cascade Dam in the NSW Blue Mountains region.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey often don't degrade in the environment and build up in our bodies, earning them the title \"forever chemicals\".\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Peter Sly, deputy director of the Queensland Children's Medical Research Institute, said control groups with no level of PFAS simply \"don't exist anymore\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm afraid every person in Australia has PFAS levels in their body. It's a matter of how high they are,\" he told the PFAS committee hearing on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nPFAS are a group of chemicals that can be added to household products to make them heat, stain, grease or water resistant. Source: SBS News Last month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released data that tested for 11 different PFAS levels in the general population.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt detected three types of PFAS in the blood of over 85 per cent of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile research groups currently test for over 40 different types of PFAS, the ABS estimates there are more than 15,000 identified compounds belonging to the PFAS class of chemicals.\n\n\n\nHow to reduce your PFAS levels\n\nIn 2022, a world-first Australian study investigated whether blood and plasma donations could remediate elevated PFAS levels in 285 firefighters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, firefighters have been exposed to higher levels of PFAS through the frequent use of firefighting foams, although alternatives have since been developed that do not include these chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing 12 months of testing staff, the study found that those who donated blood every 12 weeks had a 10 per cent reduction in PFAS chemicals.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The new guidelines designed to make your drinking water safer\n\nThe group that donated plasma every six weeks had their PFAS levels reduced by 30 per cent, with no significant change for the control group who did neither.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiri Forbes, one of the study authors and an associate professor at Sydney's Macquarie University, said understanding the impact of the reduced levels on the human body requires further study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't know yet. This is the first study that has found how we can reduce PFAS,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was really exciting to know that it's possible to be able to reduce the levels of PFAS we can measure in the blood, but we need to understand, what are the health implications of that?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther observational studies have found women have reduced levels. PFAS leave the body during menstruation and the replenished blood supply doesn't have PFAS, lowering the overall levels.\n\n\n\nWhat don't we know about PFAS?\n\nMartyn Kirk, a professor of epidemiology at the Australian National University, told SBS News that there is still plenty we don't know about PFAS.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese blind spots include;\n\n\n\nThe long-term health impacts of low exposure\n\nThe health impacts on highly exposed individuals\n\nWhere exposure comes from in the household environment\n\nMethods of reducing PFAS\n\nWhile there have been studies that have linked higher levels of PFAS with health impacts, such as higher levels of cholesterol, many don't yield consistent results, making conclusions difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk said longitudinal studies, which can be reproduced and repeated, are needed to capture exposure levels across different areas and ages as well as demonstrate where levels decline over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe believes highly exposed people, such as firefighters, present an opportunity to understand the link to different health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got a much greater chance of being able to identify the potential relationship between exposure and disease, whereas in the community, the levels are often very low,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA barrier to obtaining datasets for scientific research is the cost of samples, which are complex to interpret and expensive as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\nSly suggested a biomonitoring program by collecting leftover blood from hospitals and pooling samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By pooling samples, you protect individuals' identity, and secondly, you only have to measure one sample rather than ten or 100,\" he told the PFAS committee on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And you can get levels across the population,\" he said, adding that a similar method was currently used to test wastewater for drugs.\n\n\n\nShould we be concerned?\n\nCompanies started phasing out PFAS in the late 1990s and early 2000s, leading to a drop in exposure and blood levels as a result, said Kirk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen declines in the levels of PFAS in people's blood since 2000,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we've had nearly a 10-fold decrease in the levels of PFAS in the blood of Australians, and that continues to decrease.\"\n\n\n\nHe said that unless you're working in one of the industries that are highly exposed, you probably don't have levels that are of concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he noted anxiety in specific communities like at Wreck Bay on the NSW south coast, where an Aboriginal community believe a \"cancer cluster\" is due to PFAS contamination caused by the Department of Defence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we do need to understand better to assist those communities and also provide better information for the wider community and government to make good policy.\"\n\n\n\n",

What we do have is mineral exploration, which is the sort of preliminary stage of studying a mineral deposit and the environment conditions at a potential mine site. And so there's a handful of states that are pursuing mineral exploration in their own waters and there has been exploration on the International Seabed for some time, but there is no commercial scale mining at the moment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut U-S President Donald Trump, wanting the U-S to be a so-called \"global leader\" in seabed exploration, signed an executive order in April fast tracking the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order will open up the U-S, as well as international waters, to deep-sea mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne company has already sought a permit from the Trump administration to begin commercial mining in the Clarion-Clipperton zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nA major area of interest in the Pacific Ocean, this vast stretch of ocean floor is abundant with critical minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the UN Ocean summit in France, world leaders are demanding strict rules around deep-sea mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those calling for the regulations was U-N Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nations are now addressing navigating new waters and seabed mining. I support the ongoing work of the International Seabed Authority on this important issue. The deep sea cannot become the Wild West.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress has been made on a landmark agreement, the High Seas Treaty, which seeks to protect marine life in international waters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore countries are now joining the roughly three dozen that have already backed a moratorium on deep-sea mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the uncertain rules and regulations around who has authority is causing alarm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U-S is not a party to the International Seabed Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenpeace Political Campaigner Megan Randles says there should be no deep sea mining at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think that deep sea mining should never be able to start. It's almost incredible that we're having this debate on opening up a new extractive industry at a time when the ocean is under so much pressure and we're trying to protect it. The science is very clear - deep sea mining will cause potentially irreversible damage to the ocean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNext month a crucial meeting on creating a rule book for ocean mining will take place in Jamaica.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'High Seas Treaty' seeks to preserve the seabed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Aline Jaeckel says there will be a lot of scrutiny over the potential harms to marine life.\n\n\n\n",

It's almost like you're being punished because your information was held on a computer system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a sperm donor whom we will call Isaac.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has used an actor to record his comments, to obscure his identity and protect his sensitive personal information, which was part of a data breach earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all began when he agreed to be a sperm donor for some friends of his who couldn\u2019t conceive themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being a sperm donor is the epitome of awkward. You kind of feel like you're a bit of produce to some extent, which has been selected by your genetic characteristics. Personally, it's like why did they choose me? And that's an interesting thing, which makes you go to the depths of your own self-confidence. But the whole process is naturally incredibly awkward because effectively you've been chosen to jizz in a cup.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Isaac wanted to help the couple and agreed to go ahead with being their sperm donor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI-V-F ((in vitro fertilisation)) treatment is becoming increasingly more common in Australia, with one in every 18 births now a product of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple decided to go to Genea Fertility, one of Australia\u2019s largest I-V-F clinics, where staff asked Isaac several probing questions about his medical history, and he underwent a series of psychological sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You go through the longest form I've ever been through in my life. Any diagnosis you've had, any medication you've had. The staff there were really, really lovely, and particularly given the awkwardness of a sperm donation, they're adept at handling that awkward situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac also spoke to staff about intimate personal circumstances, about himself and his family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have mental health issues, and medication could be quite a lifesaver. I have a history of taking medication since I was 17 years old. It's still highly stigmatised. I also have a family history of autoimmune disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith his donation, the couple conceived their first child, but the joy Isaac feels for helping his dear friends start a family has been mixed with frustration and anger.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, Genea informed Isaac via email that his data was among a batch that had been breached by cybercriminals and posted to the Dark Web.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exposed data includes people's medical history, diagnoses and treatments, medications and prescriptions, and pathology and diagnostic test results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've created something beautiful, which was supposed to be a good deed. It's almost like you're being punished because your information was held on a computer system. I don't know what the next step is, but having some information about what the fuck's happening is probably a bloody good step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only could Isaac be at risk of fraud or blackmail, but so could any children conceived through the clinic, including his friend\u2019s newborn.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour months later, he feels left in the dark about what Genea is doing to protect customers from hackers and scammers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenea declined to be interviewed by SBS News, instead pointing to statements it has made on its website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our teams and cybersecurity experts are working hard to urgently review the impacted data. This is a detailed and complex process which will take some time to complete to ensure we can clearly understand the nature and extent of the data that has been published and identify impacted individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what happens now?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Dali Kaafar is the executive director of Macquarie University's cybersecurity hub.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says investigating cybercrime can be a lengthy process and in the meantime, Isaac's personal data could be used against him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they actually sense some form of vulnerability with their victim, for instance, the victim is trying to hide some sort of information from the employer or from their families, they'll probably try to leverage that in a form of blackmail.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kaafar predicts data breaches will only become more frequent, especially against companies like Genea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Health providers handle obviously vast amounts of highly sensitive personal information, not only the medical histories or the diagnosis, et cetera, but things like contact details of patients and so on. So it makes them immediately attractive targets for cybercriminals. And so I think the very first explanation or the very first view of why the health sector is consistently reported as the highest number of data breaches in Australia and globally as well, by the way, is largely due to that first piece, which is the volume and the sensitivity of the data is there. They're definitely by nature a very attractive target for cyber criminals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a scary thought for Isaac when he thinks about both his future and that of the donor-conceived child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What happens if I get a job which is relatively high profile or dealing with sensitive activity, could this open me up to not getting employed because an employer might've found my internet history, and maybe they have had ethical concerns or concerns with my health record? There are lots of bits and pieces which we all choose to disclose or not disclose as we go about our day. And if that information is out there, it's taken away my agency and my choice to disclose that information if I want to. That's only compounded further by the lack of information that I've been provided about this investigation and the data breach.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wants to see consequences for the data breach and for Genea to be held accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some things are more sensitive than others, and if you're at the more extreme end of sensitivity, you want the ramifications to be higher and you also want to make sure there's incentive to not have this happen again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike financial fraud, where victims can demonstrate losses as a dollar figure, the value of a person's privacy is subjective.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaith Gordon, an associate professor in law at the Australian National University, says people affected by breaches can make legal claims for the breach itself as well as its impact, and there could be compensation for losses such as embarrassment, humiliation and anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of legal and ethical accountability for these clinics. They do have ethical and also legal duties. For example, under Australian law, Australia's Privacy Act, there is health data protection requirements and there's medical ethical guidelines as well about informed consent and data protection. So breaches can give rise to claims for this breach and for the impact of it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Gordon says there's more that can be done to protect people, especially children conceived through these clinics\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A data breach could expose very, very personal information, including names and dates of birth and donor status and notes about embryos. So that can result in significant stigma and psychological harm and potentially future discrimination as well. Child ren have very specific rights and very specific vulnerabilities, and these need to be protected, and they also need to be empowered to actually access justice when something does go wrong in this space as well.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Winter has arrived in Australia, and you may have noticed it feels just as cold \u2014 or even colder \u2014inside your home compared with outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is typically considered a warm country, and winter temperatures do not reach the lows recorded in many other parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut inside many homes, it's a different story.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's why they feel so cold, and what you can do to keep warm.\n\n\n\nWhy are Australian houses so cold?\n\nIf you live in Australia and you're feeling the cold, you're not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nContent creators from colder places, such as Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, have taken to social media to question why Australian houses are so cold compared to those overseas.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends houses should be kept at a minimum of 18 degrees to support general health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the WHO, colder temperatures can have negative impacts on respiratory, cardiovascular and mental health. Cold temperatures can also make mould in a house worse and weaken a person's immune system.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to a 2023 study published in the Energy Research and Social Science journal, across the sampled homes, 81 per cent were below 18 degrees from June to August, with an average temperature of 16.5C.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian homes were colder than Finland, which averaged temperatures of 20 to 24 degrees, and Greenland, which had an average indoor temperature of 21.8C.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian homes are often uninsulated, draughty, or fitted with inefficient heaters, meaning they are prone to letting in cold air and letting out warm air.\n\n\n\nAustralia's regulatory standards and building codes have also historically been less stringent than other countries, according to Professor Ralph Horne, associate deputy vice chancellor of research and innovation at RMIT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As far back as 2005, research comparing Australian cities to those overseas found housing in compatible climate zones in North America and Europe was 55 per cent more efficient for heating and cooling energy compared to minimum standard housing in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The average energy efficiency [NatHERS] rating of all the overseas comparison homes was over seven stars, and we have yet to implement seven stars here in Australia, almost 20 years later.\"\n\n\n\nWhat can you do to make your house warmer?\n\nFortunately, there are a few things you can do to enhance the warmth inside your home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you own your property, consider retrofitting and upgrading your heating and insulation systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can include improving insulation in the floor, walls and ceilings, and sealing cracks in windows, door frames and floors.\n\n\n\nInstalling a split-system air conditioning and heating system, as well as floor heating, can also help make your house feel warmer.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should also regularly maintain heating systems and clear out filters to ensure they are working efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading heating systems can be costly, and energy efficiency expert Adam Corrigan, founder of Your Energy Friend, said each household is different and there are many energy-saving options to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing he recommends for households is to analyse their power bills and shop around to get the best deal, followed by making your house more energy-efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to make your home more comfortable, get your insulation sorted and do your draft proofing. That's your best return on investment. That's your best bang for buck,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCorrigan said simple changes such as installing heavy-lined curtains and a box pelmet (which goes around the top of the curtain) can be very effective at keeping your home warm and are much cheaper than double-glazed windows, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile renters cannot make such changes to homes, there are some affordable options to stay warmer in winter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your house has draughts, you can apply weather strips, 'door snakes' or other barriers around windows or door frames to prevent cold air from entering the house, and to block warm air from escaping.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have hard floors, adding rugs can provide some insulation and add warmth underfoot, and if you have ceiling fans, using the reverse setting can distribute warm air from the ceiling.\n\n\n\nFor rental homes without heating systems, portable electric or oil heaters can be an effective option for heating up single rooms. To maintain the desired heating in a specific area, ensure doors and windows are closed to prevent heat from escaping.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorne said while Australia has had a longstanding awareness of drought and water efficiency, there has not been enough of a focus on energy efficiency in homes \u2014 meaning many residents are now left in cold houses, and unable to afford heating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAn implicit reliance on cheap energy has now become increasingly challenged by the need to respond to climate change, and the rise in energy poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For a variety of reasons, energy costs have risen across Australia and this has brought to light the inefficiency of Australian homes, as households struggle to keep the heating on and pay the bills.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Who\u2019s not: Noah Balta owes his club big time. Just two months after signing a mammoth seven-year contract extension, the key defender assaulted a man in a NSW car park. As a result of the club-imposed sanction and the curfew ordered by the magistrate, Balta has played just five out of 13 games in a season when the Tigers need his experience. It\u2019s a big final three months of the season for Dion Prestia, who has managed only 15 of 36 games since the start of last year due to a series of injuries. The 32-year-old won\u2019t be part of the Tigers\u2019 next finals team but can play an important buffering role while prized picks Sam Lalor and Josh Smillie cut their teeth at the top level. The verdict: As tough as it may be for Tigers fans to watch their side lose most weeks, even the harshest judge would be encouraged by the progress made so early in their rebuild. While the exodus of mature-age talent was supposed to result in the reigning wooden-spooner plumbing deeper lows, the arrival of fresh blood who actually want to be there has seen the Tigers already improve on their two wins. With games to come against Essendon, West Coast (away), St Kilda and North Melbourne, they should be able to pick up another one or two wins to nourish the soul without much damage to their draft hand. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: C+ Gold Coast Suns (5th, 8 wins, 4 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Well, it\u2019s finally getting hot for the Suns where it really counts \u2013 on the ladder. They are primed to play finals for the first time in club history \u2013 but, yes, we have said that before, and a challenging run home to September awaits. This time, though, Damien Hardwick has his team playing a robust brand of football that should stand up when it counts. New skipper Noah Anderson is in All-Australian form, while Matt Rowell has added more run to his game. The Suns are giving Rowell time to sign a contract extension, but it\u2019s a major worry the Victorian, with several suitors, has yet to do so. Perhaps that changes soon after the bye. Touk Miller is another midfielder pressing for All-Australian selection, while defender Sam Collins and mid-sized forward Ben Long would be locks for that team were it picked now. Key forward Ben King would also be close. Recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble have done what was expected \u2013 provide dash and creativity from halfback.\n\nOn our way: Matt Rowell and Ben King have had strong starts to the season, helping the Suns eye a maiden finals berth. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: Half-back flanker Connor Budarick has been in and out of the team and has not played at the senior level since the loss to the Lions. While Rioli and Noble enjoy the rebound accolades in defensive 50, a firing Budarick would also help. As Hardwick has noted, the Suns need to stop kicking to King when he is outnumbered. King had 23 goals in his first six games, the 24-year-old has 10 in his past six games. It\u2019s over to Ethan Read, Jed Walter and Ned Moyle to get busy. The verdict: The Suns likely need only five more wins to book a September berth, but face a potentially tough month after the break \u2013 GWS [Engie Stadium], Melbourne [People First Stadium], Essendon [Marvel Stadium] and Collingwood [People First Stadium]. Richmond [in round 21] appears their only certain win in the run home, but if they are good enough, they will make the finals. Their game plan is strong \u2013 they are among the best teams for points from turnovers, intercepts and stoppages, and know how to lock the ball inside their forward-half. It\u2019s about time the Suns broke their finals duck \u2013 we\u2019re backing Hardwick in. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: B Sydney (13th, 5 wins, 8 losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Twelve months ago, the Swans were flag favourites and Isaac Heeney the top pick to win the Brownlow. That\u2019s not the case now, but Heeney remains their best-performed player. The gun midfielder is on track for similar numbers to his career-best 2024 but is lacking the same impact. The same could be said of Chad Warner, whose form has improved since the distraction of being out of contract was removed. Tagger James Jordon can count midfield stars Sam Walsh and Zach Merrett among his scalps. Youngster Matt Roberts continues to grow as a running defender, backing up his rapid improvement from last year. Who\u2019s not: An All Australian halfback last year, Nick Blakey is struggling with the extra attention on him. Injuries have forced the Swans to play him deeper, limiting his capacity to provide the springboard from defence that was a feature of their game last year. Ollie Florent paid the price for the Swans\u2019 poor form, his recent omission ending a run of 130 consecutive games. Hayden McLean is another from their grand final team who has also been dropped this year as the Swans search for marking power in their weakened forward line. Now that he is fit after a wretched 18 months with injury, skipper Callum Mills has the chance in the second half of the season to remind his critics why the club made him captain. Verdict: Injuries have wreaked havoc with rookie coach Dean Cox\u2019s first season at the helm. All Australians Errol Gulden, Tom Papley, Mills have all spent chunks of the season injured, as have reliable defender Harry Cunningham and young key forward Logan McDonald. Throw them all into the Swans\u2019 23, and it\u2019s unlikely they would be in such a desperate position. The crowded casualty ward has exposed a lack of depth. That said, the Swans have been so poor in several games that it would not have mattered who they had on the park. A fitter list raises hope they can mount a charge for the finals, but they are coming from a long way back. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport are sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter.\n\nTeams who had the bye in round 13 St Kilda (11th, five wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nJack Higgins has been a consistent force up forward, the small forward leading the Saints\u2019 goal kicking \u2013 including four goals against Geelong \u2013 to be included in the All-Australian preliminary squad. Jack Sinclair (27 disposals per game) and Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera (28) have been two of the premier rebounding half-backs. The dashing Wanganeen-Milera, off-contract and weighing up offers to return home to South Australia, has become the Saints\u2019 most important player, and the best player they have had in the past decade. That he has yet to agree to a contract extension by this point of the season is a major worry for the Saints. Former Western Bulldog Jack Macrae has been a strong leader through the midfield and found plenty of the ball (before a major lung injury), while intercept defender Callum Wilkie should be in All-Australian squad discussions. Youngster Hugo Garcia is making progress, despite a public spray from Ross Lyon during the loss to Brisbane and recent axing to the VFL. Marcus Windhager, one of several off-contract Saints, has, at times, been a stand-out, whether tagging or finding his own ball. Cookin\u2019: Jack Higgins has had a strong season, and will be in All-Australian squad calculations. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Who\u2019s not?\n\nYoung midfielder Darcy Wilson has stagnated, while Mattaes Phillipou has endured an injury-hit start to the season, the latest a calf injury in the opening minutes against Melbourne. Wingman Brad Hill still provides dash, but there are times when he could rip a game open. Rowan Marshall has been steady, but is no longer among the conversation as one of the top three ruckmen in the league. Injuries to Max King and Zaine Cordy have hurt.\n\nVerdict: The Saints are 2-4 against top-eight teams, including their best win of the season, against Geelong. They are a system-based side, so, when the system wobbles, the whole team wobbles, which can lead to heavy defeats. The flip side is what we saw against Melbourne, when they dominated through scores from defence. That they are the only team to lose to the last-placed Eagles highlights the gulf between their worst and best. The Saints still remain a line-ball finals contender, as they were before this campaign began. Through that prism, they sit where many had expected. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: C+ Man on a mission: Caleb Serong has been influential for the Dockers this season. Credit: AFL Photos Fremantle (eighth, seven wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nMidfield gun Caleb Serong (28 disposals per game) typically finds plenty of the ball, but has struggled, at times, when there has been an aggressive tag. Fellow star onballer Andrew Brayshaw (also 28 disposals per game) has been busy, and put his body on the line in the desperate final minutes against Gold Coast on Saturday, and is also firmly in contention for All-Australian selection. Jordan Clark has provided drive from half-back, Shai Bolton has added life inside attacking 50 and been arguably the second-best recruit of the season (behind Bailey Smith), while Luke Jackson has been at his best when used as a sole ruckman. The Dockers have been one of the more efficient teams, according to Champion Data, but need to find more marks inside 50 if they are to challenge for a top-four spot.\n\nLoading Who\u2019s not?\n\nSean Darcy, tied to the club until the end of 2030, has largely been a shadow of his former self because of an off-season hampered by a knee issue but was strong in ruck contests in the wet against the Suns. Whether he and Jackson can thrive in the same team remains a burning question for coach Justin Longmuir. It also remains to be seen if talls Josh Treacy, Jye Amiss and Pat Voss can consistently also work alongside each other up forward, as the Dockers have struggled to turn inside-50 advantage into scores. That could also be because of a lack of speed with ball in hand, something the Dockers have looked to address. It was great to see Nat Fyfe back for his first senior game of the season last weekend. Hayden Young\u2019s extended absence because of a serious hamstring injury which has required surgery has hurt. He shapes as an x-factor later in the season. Verdict: The Dockers remain an enigma. They have a list capable of finishing in the top four, reinforced by their win on the Gold Coast and their three wins in five games against top-eight teams, but have had head-shaking losses, including a 61-point defeat to St Kilda at Marvel Stadium, and a 14-point loss at home to a depleted Collingwood. The pressure remains on Longmuir to deliver a deep finals run. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: B- Teams who had the bye in round 12\n\nCarlton (12th, four wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nIn his 10th season, Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in his new role as a defender. Silvagni\u2019s ability to stop high-quality forwards, from a key type like Aaron Naughton to the medium-sized threat like Patrick Dangerfield, intercept and launch counter-attacks is one of the reasons why the Blues, for all their problems, has been one of the more difficult sides to score against. A streamlined George Hewett is having a career-best season in the midfield at the age of 29, and Nick Haynes has overcome a horror start to life as a Blue by turning the clock back to the pre-pandemic years. Tom De Koning was the best ruck in the competition in the first month, but his form has tailed off. Jacob Weitering had been in All-Australian form before two below-par games coming into the bye. Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in defence for the Blues so far this season. Credit: AFL Photos Who\u2019s not?\n\nThe Blues need more from their superstars. Patrick Cripps and Charlie Curnow are having reasonable years but are capable of finding another level. Harry McKay has struggled with consistency since returning from a mental health break, though his best has been the reason why the Blues have won. After another interrupted preseason, Sam Walsh has become just a player, unable to run opponents off their legs like he used to. The same can be said of Blake Acres, who is not having the same impact of his first two years at the club. Verdict: So much more was expected of the Blues, who have been one of the most disappointing clubs of the season. Despite having two Coleman medallists in their forward line the Blues are having enormous difficulties scoring. Their lack of class small forwards has hurt, but their ball movement is slow and imprecise. They are as tense as a patient visiting the dentist. Similar problems were overcome in 2023 when they mounted a stunning run to the preliminary final, but they do not have the same quality on their list. A friendly draw over the next month will give Blues fans hope but a finals berth is unlikely.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Tristan Xerri is mounting a case for All-Australian selection this year. Credit: Getty Images North Melbourne (17th, two wins, one draw, eight losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Tristan Xerri is again mounting a strong claim for a maiden All-Australian blazer. The ruckman, with his attack on the ball and wholehearted manner in which he plays, has become the Kangaroos\u2019 on-field spiritual leader. Small forward Paul Curtis has continued his improvement and, with 19 goals to the bye, is on track to pass his career-best haul of 30 last year. Cameron Zurhaar has rediscovered his bull-at-a-gate ways in attack to add much-needed bite to the forward line. Veteran Luke Parker has justified his acquisition on the field even if his greatest impact might be felt in the locker room. Who\u2019s not?\n\nThis might be harsh on North\u2019s leading possession-getter but Caleb Daniel is not having the impact he should. A damaging kick at his best, Daniel has often erred on the side of recklessness with his ball use by taking low-percentage options deep in defence. In his third year at Arden Street, Griffin Logue cannot get a clear run at it due to injury and now form. Dropped amid North\u2019s horror run, Logue is yet to reclaim his position in the side. The Roos need more from experienced duo Aidan Corr and Zac Fisher, who have both had stints in the VFL.\n\nCaleb Daniel: Plenty of possessions but more impact needed. Credit: Getty Images Verdict: As painful as this season has been for their fans, North have actually improved. At this stage last year, they were winless with a percentage of 55.9 and uncompetitive. This year, they have been in contention at three-quarter-time in eight games. The question is whether North should be further advanced after five seasons in the bottom two. Given they have traded away their first pick, the Kangaroos would have expected to have picked up an extra win or two instead of being in the familiar position of 17th. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Port Adelaide (15th, four wins, seven losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot?\n\nPort\u2019s best phase of the season came after Zak Butters returned from injury. Butters was instrumental in Port\u2019s best win of the year, against Hawthorn, but needs more help in the guts. The Power cannot afford to lose him. Moved to half-back, Connor Rozee has maintained his high standards while others\u2019 have fallen, though Port need him in the middle as well as providing run out of defence. Though not necessarily built for it, Mitch Georgiades has prospered being the main man in the forward 50. Miles Bergman\u2019s star is on the rise though he, like Butters, may be on the move at season\u2019s end. Who\u2019s not?\n\nEsava Ratugolea, Ivan Soldo, and Jordon Sweet were recruited at the end of 2023 to help Port take the next step. Eighteen months on, those moves have not had the desired effect. Ratugolea is struggling in an overworked defence that does not get enough pressure on the ball from up the field. Sweet lost his spot after being monstered by Tim English, and his understudy Soldo is out of favour. The move of Jeremy Finlayson into defence lasted just one disastrous game against Collingwood. Ed Richards has been a midfield weapon for the Western Bulldogs. Credit: Getty Images Verdict: Ken Hinkley\u2019s 13th and final season at the helm at Alberton is headed for an inglorious finish. Preliminary finalists last year, Port are headed for a bottom-six finish. The impending handover from Hinkley to Josh Carr is an easy target to explain Port\u2019s poor season even though many had tipped them to be this season\u2019s slider. The club would not have seen such a drop coming, given they traded out their first-round pick for Jack Lukosius, who has been injured. Most concerning is how quickly the Power have waved the white flag when things became difficult. Five of the heaviest losses of the Hinkley era have come in Port\u2019s last 24 games.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: E Western Bulldogs (seventh, six wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nEd Richards has morphed from a capable half-back into one of the game\u2019s best midfielders in the past 12 months. Richards\u2019 speed and penetrating left foot makes him a major weapon for the Dogs. Rebounding defender Bailey Dale, who had a career-best 49 possessions a fortnight ago, is on track for a second All-Australian blazer. Tom Liberatore is defying Father Time. Small forward Rhylee West is one of the most improved players in the league, thriving since taking over from the injured Cody Weightman. Matt Kennedy is close to the recruit of the year since his move from Carlton, revelling as a midfielder who can also be dangerous when moved forward. Who\u2019s not?\n\nVeteran defender Liam Jones has struggled after having his pre-season severely disrupted by a serious hamstring injury. He lost his place to former cricketer James O\u2019Donnell, who has performed admirably in the key defensive post alongside the rejuvenated Rory Lobb. Injuries threatened to derail the season. Marcus Bontempelli, Adam Treloar, Sam Darcy have all spent significant periods in a star-studded casualty ward at Whitten Oval, but all are either back or will return shortly after the bye for the Dogs\u2019 run to September.

        "text": "Five decades ago, the housing market looked unrecognisable. Find out how much the average home was selling for in Sydney's northern suburbs.\n\nThe prices of property 50 years ago were a lot different to now. Source: Getty/Facebook\n\nA page of real estate listings from 1972 has left Aussies shocked at just how much house prices have increased in the last 50 years. In the nation\u2019s most expensive city \u2014 where the median home value is now more than $1.2m \u2014 property prices have increased by an eye-watering 5000 per cent since the listings were published.\n\nThe 1972 edition of The Realtor shows a page of homes located across Frenchs Forest, Belrose, Beacon Hill and Allambie Heights on Sydney's Northern Beaches. One three-bedroom home was for sale for just $23,950, while the most expensive property on the page is a four-bedder with \u201croom for a pool\u201d listed at $44,950.\n\nOne of the homes in Beacon Hill, valued at the time for $27,500, sold in 2021 for $2.55m \u2014 a staggering increase of more than 9000 per cent, outpacing the growth in average wages which has been under 2500 per cent over the same 53-year-period.\n\nNorthern beaches realtor Mark Novak from Novak Properties told Yahoo News that even the smaller homes on the old listing page would be worth upwards of $2m now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"You can see in that photo, there's the little fellas that are just one level three-bedders, they're about that $2.2m mark. And then you can see the two storey examples, they're probably in the higher end of that $2.7m - $2.9m mark,\" he said. \"It's wild.\"\n\nThe listing from 1972 shows the homes priced between $20,000 and $45,000. Source: Paul Brennan/Facebook\n\nWeekly wage in 1972 was just $85\n\nWhile these days you\u2019d be lucky to get a new car for those 1970s prices, back then it was still out of reach for some.\n\nThe average weekly wage in Australia in 1972 was $85.50, according to data from the Reserve Bank of Australia. This would put the average Australian\u2019s annual salary at just under $4500 a year.\n\nTo purchase the cheaper three-bedroom home, a resident would be spending about five times their salary, though the interest rate was around 7 per cent.\n\nIn 2025, the typical Australian full-time worker earns just under $100,000. With the median house value in Frenchs Forest currently sitting at $2.2m, buyers would be forking out more that 22 times their salary to buy a home in the area.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the increases feel ridiculously steep, Mark insists it's all part of the steady property trend that sees homes double in value every 10 years or so.\n\nHe described the area around Frenchs Forest as a \"lovely, honest, Australian\" neighbourhood, where the families work hard and care about their community. He said it's likely the people who bought their homes 50 years ago may not have been particularly wealthy, but are now sitting on a pot of gold.\n\nBut despite that, he made the interesting point that many of the homes on the listing remain relatively unchanged.\n\n\"The houses look the same. I think you'd find the kitchens and bathrooms have been changed, but structurally they're pretty similar from the outside.\n\n\"These are those guys where the furniture is the same. The cars are similar. They've kept everything. They bought once when they were real young and they never got in and out, or changed it. Whereas our generation and the newer generation, you're constantly evolving and changing, which costs money.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor those first home buyers overwhelmed by today's prices who think they'll never be able to afford a home, Mark says it is absolutely possible and offered a tip.\n\n\"Use your super. First home buyers can use their super, but not many people know that. They can voluntarily contribute to their super above their normal repayments and then pull it out to buy a property so they can save faster,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
