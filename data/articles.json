(Photo: Kate Geraghty) (Kate Geraghty)\n\nPrepare for the heat\ufeff\n\nEven fit people are at increased risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke when the mercury climbs. \ufeff\n\nSports Medicine Australia (SMA) chief executive Jamie Crain advises exercisers to take increased precautions to guard against heat exhaustion or the more serious heat stroke.\n\n\"During times of extreme heat, it's vital for people exercising to take precautions over and above\ufeff what they would on a temperate day,\" he told 9news.com.au.\n\nThey include limiting activity times to the cooler periods of the day, such as early morning and evening.\n\nIt's best to avoid the warmest hours, from 10am to 3pm.\n\nMaintaining hydration is essential, and during extreme heat you should keep sipping water even if you don't feel thirsty.\ufeff\n\nOn very hot days, the SMA advises drinking at least 500 millilitres of water in the hour before taking exercise. And caffeine, including coffee, should be avoided in the hours leading up to working out.\ufeff\n\n\ufeffIf you're outside, remember to wear sunglasses, sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat.\n\nChoice of clothing is also important. Where possible, select lightweight and breathable clothes with extra ventilation\ufeff.\n\nFor those taking exercise indoors, try and find a location with air conditioning.\n\nOn very hot days it's best to try and exercise indoors. (Photo Janie Barrett) (Sydney Morning Herald)\n\n\ufeffSigns of heat-related illness\n\nCrain says the health impacts of heat-related illness can be a direct result of an increase in core temperature or the result of the strain on the heart associated with combating the jump in body temperature.\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"If anyone experiences nausea or vomiting, that is a sign they need to cease exercising and take immediate action to cool down,\" he said.\ufeff\n\nOther symptoms of heat exhaustion include dizziness, cramps, headache and general weakness.\n\nAnyone experiencing these should move immediately to a shaded area, remove as much clothing and protective equipment and rehydrate.\n\nCrain says more serious warning signs such as slurred speech, impaired decision making and poorer brain function indicates heat stroke.\n\n\"That requires immediate medical attention ... straight away you'd be calling for medical help ... trying to cool them down with something like an ice bath,\" he said.\ufeff\n\nWhile even elite athletes are at risk from heat-linked conditions, some people are at more risk than others.\n\nThey include those aged over 65 years, especially if unfit. The SCA cautions that age effects on thermoregulation, the body's process of controlling internal temperature, may become progressively worse with age.\n\nThe risk of falling victim to heat stress is also greater among heart or kidney disorder patients.",

( ) It's shows like United States of Tara that really make you think, \"Is there anything Toni Collette can't do?\" In the mid-2000s sitcom, Collette plays not one, but four different characters, all who reside inside a single suburban mum. Tara has dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple identity disorder) so in times of stress her 'alters' show up to help. At any time, you don't know if you're going to get 1950s housewife Alice, foul-mouthed Vietnam veteran Buck, or sassy teen Shoshana. It's up to her family \u2014 father Max (John Corbett), daughter Kate (a very young Brie Larson) and son Marshall (Keir Gilchrist) \u2014 to weather the storm of Tara's changing moods. Created by Juno's Diablo Cody and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, United States of Tara is whip-smart, engaging and an acting masterclass from one of Australia's finest exports. Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer Shoresy Letterkenny co-creator Jared Keeso plays the main character in spin-off Shoresy. ( ) Would you believe that Heated Rivalry was not Canadian creator Jacob Tierney's first hockey-themed show? No, that honour belongs to Shoresy \u2014 itself a spin-off from Tierney and co-creator/star Jared Keeso's beloved and long-running sitcom Letterkenny. The lightning-quick comedy revolves around Shoresy (Keeso), a loud-mouthed, hockey player whose team is at risk of being shut down after a worrisome season. While there might not be any steamy bedroom scenes in Shorsey, Tierney's directorial fingerprints are all over the show \u2014 especially in its ample needle drops and the care afforded to the show's core relationships. It might seem raw and uncouth on the surface but dig a little deeper and you'll find Shorsey has a heart as soft as marshmallow. Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer ER The cast of ER. ( ) Before there was The Pitt, there was ER \u2014 the ultra-long running medical drama that launched the film career of an alarmingly young George Clooney. In 2026, between The Pitt, St. Denis Medical and the upcoming Scrubs reboot, the hospital procedural is booming, making it the perfect time to revisit the second longest-running prime time medical drama in US history (just behind Grey's Anatomy). Spanning an incredible 15 seasons and 300-plus episodes, ER focused on the high-stakes drama coming out of the Cook County General Hospital. Each week the doctors and nurses must treat the latest patient while also balancing the drama in their own lives. Come for the medical drama, stay to spot the myriad of guest stars, from Ewan McGregor to Zac Efron, that were still building their profiles. Where to watch: iview\n\nNew movies\n\nGodzilla Minus One Godzilla Minus One redefined what you can do with visual effects on a small budget. Godzilla Minus One might be the 37th movie featuring the scaly kaiju but director and writer Takashi Yamazaki's take on the monster classic breathes fresh air into the franchise. While many of Godzilla's US outings focus on the smash and crash of it all, Yamazaki uses the lizard to tap into deep anti-war themes baked deep into Godzilla's 70-plus year history. Set towards the end of WWII, Minus One follows kamikaze pilot K\u014dichi Shikishima, the lone survivor of a midnight kaiju attack who returns to Tokyo plagued with guilt only to discover his parents have perished in a bombing on the city. This becomes the least of K\u014dichi's problems as US nuclear tests have mutated Godzilla into a force strong enough to wipe out the whole city. Beyond being a heart-wrenching and effective story, Minus One's visual effects, from citywide destruction to Godzilla's neon spikes, are immaculate and earned the team an Academy Award \u2014 making Minus One the only Godzilla film in history to nab an Oscar. Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer The Whale Brendan Fraser in the 2022 film The Whale. ( ) Like many of director Darren Aronofsky films, you'll only want to watch The Whale once. Set almost entirely in the cluttered house of morbidly obese college English teacher Charlie (Brendan Fraser). Almost completely immobile, Charlie spends all of his days binge eating, teaching his class from behind a turned-off webcam and occasionally talking with nurse and his only friend Liz (Hong Chau). The film follows his attempts to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Sadie Sink) before his health succumbs to his morbid obesity. Based on the 2012 play by Samual D Hunter, praise was heaped on Fraser's heartbreaking performance, which earned him an Academy Award and a Hollywood redemption arc for the ages. However, some critics took aim at the film's representation of morbid obesity and Fraser's use of a fat suit. Far from the perfect film, The Whale is worth watching for the marvel of human emotion that pours out of Fraser and Chau's performances. Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer Priscilla Jacob Elordi as Elvis and Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla, in a scene from Priscilla. ( ) Before Aussie Jacob Elordi set his sights on Oscar gold playing a monster, he was the King in Sofia Coppola's recreation of Priscilla Presley's 1985 memoir. The movie opens in the late 50s where 24-year-old Elvis Presely, at the height of his fame, meets the woman who will eventually be his wife, 14-year-old Priscilla. What follows is a tumultuous relationship between the devoted Priscilla and a musician grappling with both fame and substance abuse, as well as the birth of their only child. Coppola's sensitive hand unspools a dual narrative of dreamy teenage wish fulfilment and the stark reality of young Priscilla's situation. Enriched by lush period costuming and Cailee Spaeny's expansive work playing Priscilla from mid-teens to her late 20s, Priscilla is a headstrong antidote to the mythos of the rock star. Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer\n\nFamily favourites\n\nBring It On Bring It On turns 26 in 2026. ( ) This 2000 high school classic has been deceptively tricky to find on streaming in Australia in the past, which is why it's so exciting that it's not only now available to stream but it's completely for frreeeeee. Torrance Shipman has dreamed of being cheer captain since she joined the six-time national-championship-winning Rancho Carne Toros at her sunny California high school. But heavy is the head that wears the crown, and soon Captain Torrance is confronted with the notion that her team's award-winning cheers were all stolen from a nearby competitor school. Lighter than the person at the top of a human pyramid and featuring formative performances from Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku, Bring It On is an essential coming-of-watch for any teen or tween, and a delightful blast from the past for anyone who grew up screaming that there were sexy and cute (and popular to boot). Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer The Boy and the Heron The Boy and the Heron follows the story of Mahito and is partly based on Hayao Miyazaki's childhood memories. ( ) In 2023, Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki pulled a Farnsey and came out of retirement to deliver this eclectic fantasy story. Filled with the wonder and danger of many Ghibli worlds, Miyazaki's latest adventure follows Mahito Maki, a 12-year old boy dealing with the passing of his mother. When a deranged heron tells Mahito that his mum is still alive he enters fantastical worlds full of wizards, man-eating parakeets and, of course, one cantankerous heron. The Boy and The Heron is possibly Miyazaki's most personal film, as parts of Mahito's life mirror the filmmaker's childhood in wartime Japan. His open rumination on resilience and the transformation that comes with responsibility earned Miyazaki's first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature since 2003's Spirited Away. And while the play with Ghibli films is usually to watch in the original Japanese with subtitles, we implore you to give the star-studded English dub for this one \u2014 even if it's just to hear Robert Pattinson's insane Heron croak. Where to watch: SBSonDemand Trailer Detective Pikachu Ryan Reynolds voices a very mouthy Pikachu in Detective Pikachu ( ) On paper, a young man trying to solve a mystery with the help of a talking Pikachu Pokemon voiced by Ryan Reynolds can sound \u2026 unappealing. But look past the groan-worthy title and Detective Pikachu will reward you with a delightful rollercoaster of a family film. Tim (Justice Smith) is an aspiring Pokemon trainer who gets tumbled up in the years-old conspiracy over the death of his estranged father. Alone in Ryme City, Tim quickly teams up with a Pikachu that just happens to be possessed with the wise-cracking voice of Ryan Reynolds (who only Tim can hear) and looks dashing as a deerstalker. Alongside peppy junior reporter Lucy, the pair dig deep into corruption that threatens the whole city. The narrative wouldn't (and didn't) win any awards but the real delight in the film is how their robust VFX team augments various Pokemon in live action. You'll want to reach right through the screen to touch Pikachu's fluffy fur, you'll recoil at Mr. Mime's uncanny valley appearance, you'll want to ride the mountain-sized Torterra. That alone is worth the 100-minute run time. Where to watch: iview Trailer\n\nAussie nostalgia",

(ABC News: Adam Wyatt)\n\nThe RBA deputy reiterated that the central bank's priority was ensuring inflation remained on target, between 2 and 3 per cent.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI), released yesterday, showed headline inflation running at 3.4 per cent in the year to November, while the RBA's preferred measure of underlying inflation, the trimmed mean, was at 3.2 per cent.\n\n\"I think we all remember the pain and the difficulty, many of us are still working that through, of that persistent high period of inflation over the last few years,\" Mr Hauser said.\n\n\"It's our job to ensure that doesn't happen again.\"\n\nInflation too high, but 'not a lot of news' in this week's data\n\nReactions to Wednesday's inflation data were mixed, after the CPI eased back more than many economists had forecast.\n\nMr Hauser talked down the significance, however, describing it as \"helpful\" but \"largely as we expected\".\n\n\"Inflation above 3 per cent \u2014 let's be clear, it's too high,\" he said.\n\n\"We wish to keep inflation between 2 and 3 per cent, that is currently above that.\"\n\nMr Hauser said there \"wasn't a lot of news in the data yesterday for us\".\n\nHe said inflation coming down partly reflected the Black Friday sales in November, but measures around the costs of housing picked up.\n\n\" Most of those numbers were broadly in line with our expectations. \"\n\nRBA takes one-to-two-year view on inflation: Hauser\n\nMr Hauser also emphasised that the RBA did not target inflation as it stood currently.\n\n\"We're trying to target inflation in a year or two years' time and judging the outlook for inflation.\"\n\nHe said that judgement did not just include the current level of inflation, but also \"on the pace of demand and conditions in the labour market, on global conditions \u2026 and five or six other variables\".\n\nInflation cools but February 'remains in play' Inflation cooled in November, with the consumer price index rising 3.4 per cent over the year, down from 3.8 per cent a month earlier.\n\nNovember was just the second set of full monthly CPI data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nThe ABS will release the December quarterly CPI data at the end of January, giving the central bank another inflation update before its next meeting.\n\n\"We will be waiting for the quarterly inflation number in two or three weeks' time before we take a view on where we think inflation is today,\" Mr Hauser said.\n\nAs for what that number would need to be to prompt a rate rise, Mr Hauser offered a tongue-in-cheek response.\n\n\"How rude can I be on the ABC?\" he asked.\n\n\"But we are not targeting Q4 2025 inflation \u2026 you can't even target inflation a quarter out.\n\n\" You're targeting the whole time inflation out a year to two years, and that informs making a judgement. \"\n\nThe deputy governor said if the number was \"spectacularly high or spectacularly low, we'd have to ask ourselves what was driving that, and that might be an important part of our overall judgement\".\n\n\"But we don't have a rule that says if it's 0.9 we hold, and if it's 1 we raise and if it's 0.7 we cut \u2014 we take a view of the whole economy.\"\n\nRBA's quandary: To hold or to hike? The Reserve Bank governor has opened the door to interest rate hikes in 2026, but how soon will she walk through it?\n\nAsked about market pricing for the February meeting, which currently sits around two-thirds for rates to remain on hold and one-third for a rate hike, Mr Hauser said he would not comment on whether it was \"a sensible estimate of the outcome\".\n\n\"It's true, as you say, that markets are not placing 100 per cent weight increase in February \u2026 you pay your money, you take your choice.\n\n\"It's what financial markets have assumed.\"",

        "text": "Opinions are divided as to whether Nick Kyrgios deserves an Australian Open singles wildcard, but he has an unlikely ally on his side \u2014 retiring veteran Stan Wawrinka.\n\nAustralian Open organisers have just three men's singles wildcards remaining, and 40-year-old Wawrinka appears a near certainty to get one.\n\nWawrinka has already announced this year will be his final season on tour, and the 2014 Australian Open winner will be a hit among fans if he is handed a start at Melbourne Park.\n\nAnother guaranteed crowd puller is 2022 Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios, but the wildcard debate surrounding him is far more complicated.\n\nMultiple wrist and knee surgeries means Kyrgios has played just seven singles tour matches over the past three years, with his ranking plummeting to 670.\n\nThe 30-year-old's most recent singles match lasted just 66 minutes \u2014 a 6-3 6-4 loss to American Aleksandar Kovacevic at the Brisbane International earlier this week.\n\nKyrgios limps out of Brisbane International Nick Kyrgios limped out of the Brisbane International at the first hurdle as the 30-year-old's ailing body lets him down once again.\n\nBut Kyrgios was able to team with Thanasi Kokkinakis to make it to the second round of the doubles, knocking off the highly fancied pairing of Matt Ebden and Rajeev Ram along the way.\n\nThe pair eventually lost to number six seeds Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul in the second round.\n\nJust last week, Kyrgios stated he would be open to slogging it out in Australian Open qualifying if he wasn't handed a wildcard, but gaining a direct entry would no doubt be his preferred option.\n\nKyrgios and Wawrinka's troubled history\n\nIn 2015, Kyrgios was fined $35,000 for making a derogatory comment about Wawrinka's then-partner during his singles match against him, which at the time prompted the outraged Swiss to demand that the ATP take \"major action against him\".\n\nBut Wawrinka was full of grace on Wednesday night when asked his opinion on whether Kyrgios deserves to receive a wildcard for the Australian Open.\n\n\"He's been injured a lot the last few years, it's not easy for him,\" Wawrinka said after Switzerland secured a berth in the United Cup semi-finals.\n\n\"But he had amazing results in his career, made a final in a grand slam.\n\n\"So, of course, if he's fit and ready, he'll want to play there.\n\n\"And he's been playing a bit more the last few weeks, playing some exhibition matches, and playing in Brisbane now, so hopefully he can be fit without injury for the full year.\"\n\nThe crowd-pulling power of Kyrgios could be hard to ignore.\n\nSpecial Ks lose at Brisbane International Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis's doubles campaign at the Brisbane International has come to an end.\n\nBut Jordan Thompson, whose injury-plagued 2025 campaign saw him drop to 113th in the world, and fellow Australian Chris O'Connell (114th) would also be deserved recipients.\n\nWawrinka showed he has plenty of fight left in him with a gutsy three-sets win over world No.27 Arthur Rinderknech at the United Cup last weekend.\n\nThe three-time grand slam winner will be back in action alongside teammate Belinda Bencic in Sydney later this week when Switzerland take on either either Belgium or Czechia in the semi-finals of the United Cup.\n\nWawrinka has been in discussions with Australian Open boss Craig Tiley about a wildcard, but nothing has been locked in as yet.\n\n\"I'm super happy if I get one,\" Wawrinka said.\n\n\"I want to play one more time of course, my last year.\n\n\"I have amazing memories from there \u2026 after winning my first slam there. It will be amazing.\n\n\"But I had one job to do if I wanted to play one more time. It was to be in the top 100, and I'm not.\n\n\"Next week, I'm going to play Auckland. I've got a wildcard there. So I'm happy where I am right now, and I'm not worried too much about what's going to happen in Melbourne.\"\n\nAAP",

(Reuters: Miraflores Palace)\n\n\"You see this as a desperate act of a declining power,\" Dr Villar said, describing it as a \"brazen attempt\" to warn countries against becoming too close to China.\n\n\"But of course the Chinese, like its main partner Russia, don't scare easily,\" he said.\n\n\" The strength of China's foreign policy in both geopolitical and geo-strategic means is that it does business with everyone. \"\n\nThat even included Argentina, Dr Villar said, where President Javier Milei is \"one of Trump's key allies\".\n\nMaduro toppling 'not an existential threat' to Chinese interests\n\nChinese companies are among the only foreign-owned businesses still operating in Venezuela.\n\nThe largest international buyer of Venezuelan oil is China. (Reuters: Issac Urrutia/File)\n\nThe state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation runs a number of joint ventures in the country.\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank, estimates some US$2.1 billion ($3.1 billion) in Chinese investment flowed to Venezuela's oil sector between 2016 and 2023.\n\nThe capture of Mr Maduro and heightened instability in Venezuela therefore leaves China exposed.\n\nOutstanding debt to China is estimated to exceed US$10 billion ($14.9 billion) \u2014 and there are questions whether this will ever be repaid.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, it's not an existential threat to China if these loans fall through,\" said China-Global South Project editor Eric Olander.\n\nThe much larger economy of Brazil was at the \"epicentre\" of Chinese engagement in Latin America, he told ABC's The World.\n\n\"When we look at Venezuela, it's important, but it's not in the top tier of the geopolitical hierarchy for China in that region,\" Olander said.\n\nDespite China being the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil, it only accounted for around 4 per cent of China's overall crude imports last year.\n\nAnd while Mr Maduro has been removed from power, his administration remains largely intact.\n\nVenezuelans celebrate a future reclaimed \u2014 but the power struggle is just getting started Venezuelans celebrate Maduro\u2019s fall \u2014 but on the ground the fight for power is just beginning.\n\nSome analysts argue China is well-positioned to engage with those left in power.\n\n\"Beijing has consistently pursued engagement with all viable political actors, regardless of ideology,\" Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue, told Bloomberg.\n\n\"[It] is likely to maintain what presence it can over the long term in light of its substantial investments and Venezuela's strategic importance.\"\n\nCharles Sturt's Dr Villar said China's approach was not to engage the US through conflict.\n\n\"China's strategy is to emerge as the adult in the room,\" he said.\n\nA banner depicts Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and Xi Jinping with a message that reads in Spanish: \"An example for the world.\" (AP: Cristian Hernandez/File)\n\nAs Mr Maduro's trial began in New York this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: \"No country can act as the 'world policeman', and no country can proclaim itself the 'international judge'.\n\n\"We stand ready to work with all countries to uphold the authority of international law,\" she said.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMr Trump has said US oil companies will enter Venezuela to \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country\".\n\nVenezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but production has declined significantly in recent years.\n\nThe International Energy Agency reports it produced around 860,000 barrels per day in November last year \u2014 less than a third of the amount Venezuela was producing a decade ago.\n\nIt would require an estimated US$100 billion in investment and more than a decade to bring Venezuela's sector back to previous production levels, said Professor Hearn from the University of Melbourne.\n\n\"That's a lot of money, it's a lot of time, and it's really not certain that US companies would want to put up that kind of cash,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump has entertained the idea of further military interventions in the Americas, suggesting a similar operation in Colombia, which neighbours Venezuela, \"sounds good to me\".\n\nThe US secretary of sate Mr Rubio also hinted at targeting Cuba, which is closely allied with Venezuela.\n\n\"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned,\" he said.\n\nSome analysts have suggested US actions in Venezuela could embolden China to act against Taiwan.\n\nWhere will Trump send troops next? As the president flew back to Washington from his Florida Christmas break, he spoke to the press on Air Force One \u2014 and entertained the idea of targeting another four nations.\n\n\"US opponents will no doubt play up the lack of a clear justification under international law,\" said Bronwen Maddox, director of the London-based think tank Chatham House.\n\n\"Russia will use US actions to bolster its justifications for its invasion of Ukraine. China may cite Venezuela in its rhetoric regarding Taiwan.\"\n\nThe China-Global South Project's Olander argued that, as with the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the political instability caused by the fall of Mr Maduro could easily backfire against Washington.\n\n\"It's just too early to suggest if it's a blow [to Chinese interests in Latin America] or not,\" he said.\n\n\"We could be in a situation next year at this time where there's an anti-American push in Venezuela that turns in favour of China.\"",

        "text": "As southern New South Wales experiences its most intense heatwave since the Black Summer of 2019-20, a community-led initiative is being rolled out to help vulnerable residents find relief from the heat.\n\nCommunity buildings across the Eurobodalla Shire, on the state's far south coast, are opening their doors over the coming days, acting as heatwave havens and offering cool, safe spaces for locals.\n\nSeven out of nine spaces will be open from Thursday until Saturday in Batemans Bay, Narooma and Moruya at varying times, in the first trial of the havens.\n\nThe buildings have been retrofitted by the Southcoast Health and Sustainability Alliance (SHASA) with solar panels and batteries, air conditioning, kitchens, and backup generators to ensure they remain operational during extreme conditions and bushfires.\n\n\"At the moment in our community, we don't have large shopping centres or many places where people can go to escape heat or smoke,\" SHASA president Kathryn Maxwell said.\n\n\"If we can have lots of smaller facilities around the community, it takes pressure off the big evacuation centres.\"\n\nThe heatwave havens across the Eurobodalla offer residents a chance to cool down. (ABC South East NSW: Isla Evans)\n\nSafe havens\n\nFollowing the experience of the Black Summer bushfires, SHASA worked with local churches, community halls, and surf lifesaving clubs to upgrade facilities by helping them apply for grant funding.\n\n\"It's absolutely critical to have solar, batteries, and a backup generator because if the power goes down, you can keep these facilities running,\" Ms Maxwell said.\n\n\"The other key element is air conditioning, which allows for temperature control, and air filters if there is a bushfire.\"\n\nHavens are required to have a backup power source like a generator or solar power. (ABC South East NSW: Toby Hemmings)\n\nJulie Brown from Southern Life Church in Moruya said part of the appeal of working with SHASA was the long-term benefits for the facilities, as well as helping the community.\n\n\"It's helped us with our bills because we're an independent church,\" Ms Brown said.\n\n\"To have solar is great, especially when our power bills have been high because we run multiple freezers.\"\n\nThe havens will be operated by volunteers, including Ms Brown.\n\n\"We're just encouraging people to drop in, even if it's just for a few hours or for all day, have a cuppa with us, get cool,\" Ms Brown said.\n\n\"We can put a movie on, we've got music, we've got colouring in for kids, we've got all those sorts of things that we can at least offer for people to come and take refuge.\"\n\nVolunteers at Southern Life Church Moruya have been stocking up ahead of the heat haven opening. (ABC South East NSW: Toby Hemmings)\n\nHelping the vulnerable\n\nA key goal of the havens is to provide a safe and accessible space for vulnerable residents to shelter from extreme conditions.\n\nAffordable housing resident Kellie Beavis said she became aware of the havens through a post on Facebook.\n\nShe said her Moruya villa did not regulate heat well, particularly in such intense temperatures.\n\n\"There's heat that gets in through the windows, and there's no relief,\" Ms Beavis said.\n\nAffordable housing resident Kellie Beavis says she cannot afford to run her air conditioning unit. (ABC South East NSW: Toby Hemmings)\n\nMs Beavis has air conditioning at home, but is reluctant to use it due to the high cost of electricity.\n\n\"I'm still wary of using it because it's expensive,\" she said.\n\n\"The elderly in the community and the people who can't afford the electricity need to know [about these havens]. It's really important that we support people like that.\"\n\nThe havens are designed for vulnerable community members, including children, the elderly, and those who do not have air conditioning. (ABC South East NSW: Isla Evans)\n\nMs Maxwell said this week's extreme weather would be a test to help them figure out what their community needed from heat havens in the future.\n\n\"We don't expect it to be totally smooth, we don't expect it to be perfect,\" she said.\n\n\"It's really an opportunity for us to learn.\"",

That's a catch.\n\n\"But technically, the correct decision was made. That's how the rules are laid out. The officials made the correct call.\n\n\"It doesn't make it less frustrating. I think if that's in the backyard and your brother hits it up, he's walking off the field.\"\n\nOllie Peake showed cool nerves to guide the Renegades home. (Getty Images: James Worsfold)\n\nPeake \u2014 who headed straight from the ground to the airport bound for Africa, where he will captain Australia at the ICC Men's Under-19 World Cup \u2014 described the finish as \"surreal\".\n\n\"To do it here in front of all the Scorchers fans is pretty special and what you grow up dreaming of doing,\" said Peake, who finished 42 not out.\n\n\"I had a bit of luck and [I'm] just happy that it all paid off tonight.\"\n\nAfter Josh Brown (22) teed off early, the Renegades were cruising at 1-51 from six overs before being restricted to 4-23 from the next eight.\n\nAt one stage, 50 balls passed without a boundary before Peake dominated a 42-run sixth-wicket stand with skipper Will Sutherland (15) and rode his good fortune to finish his BBL campaign on a stunning high.\n\nEarlier, Renegades teammate Gurinder Sandhu snared 4-28 to take his season tally to 14 wickets at 14.71, moving into top position on the Golden Arm leaderboard.\n\nHardie (44) was scratchy but top-scored for the Scorchers, who wobbled early and crashed hard late, losing 5-11 from 17 deliveries.\n\nAAP/ABC",

(ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\n\"This heat for this time of year is just a Tuesday for us,\" Marble Bar Community Resource Centre manager Bazz Harris laughed.\n\nEven so, with the town's prominent temperature gauge clocking up a reading of 51C earlier this week, residents have shared their tips on how to keep cool in a heatwave.\n\n\"We have had a gentleman who purchased 30 bags of ice and filled his blow-up pool with it, and sat on his front porch with a beer,\" Mr Harris said.\n\n\"The trick there \u2014 he was butt naked \u2014 it was not a sexy sight, but it's what he did to keep cool.\"\n\nBazz Harris says people take extraordinary measures to stay cool. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nSleep and hydration key\n\nPilbara locals enjoy fresh waterholes to keep themselves cool in the long summers, and early showers before the cold tap turns warm.\n\nBut for those without access to waterholes, Mr Harris's top tip came down to sleeping habits.\n\n\" A good eight hours' sleep at night in a cool air-conditioned bedroom and you can deal with the day. \"\n\nMarble Bar's maximum temperature for this month sits at 51C. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nMisting toilet invention\n\nMarble Bar resident John Mladenovich recalled finding a tin shed toilet at an exploration site in the Great Sandy Desert where an automated mister had been installed.\n\n\"The thunderbox, they called it,\" he laughed.\n\n\"As soon as you sat on the dunny, it was automatic; they had this mist coming down.\n\n\"In the breeze, it was almost like you were in aircon.\"\n\nJohn Mlandenovich likes to keep cool by drinking a beer and watching the cricket. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nOn a more serious note, Mr Mladenovich recommended wearing a wet towel over your head, neck and face, or running under the sprinkler.\n\n\"But make sure you've got your clothes on,\" he said.\n\nHe also urged anyone sweltering through the current heat to remember to replace their electrolytes when drinking plenty of water.\n\n\"One orange, squeezed, a whole lemon and a teaspoon of baking soda \u2014 drink that, and you'll feel refreshed,\" he said.\n\nBut most importantly, Mr Mladenovich said sitting in the shade watching the cricket with a beverage in hand was the best way to keep cool.\n\n\"One thousand per cent, you don't feel the heat,\" he said.",

The program was designed to test the depth and strike extensions of known antimony-gold mineralisation, with a focus on potential splays and parallel lodes. The program was also used to validate geophysical targets identified in earlier surveys.\n\nStandout intercepts included 6.4 metres at a hefty 12.92 grams per tonne (g/t) gold equivalent from 208m, with 4.1 metres of that interval grading an eye-catching 19.76g/t gold equivalent.\n\nThat hole intersected what the company believes could be a new parallel lode in the footwall of the main Clarks Gully structure, pointing to additional near-mine growth potential and warranting further follow-up drilling.",

        "text": "As Australians return from holidays and settle back into daily life, many are suffering from a post-Christmas financial hangover.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverspending during the holiday season is easy to do and can leave people feeling stressed and overwhelmed when they realise how much debt they have accumulated.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut financial adviser Helen Baker said it was important to take action straight away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you just put your head in the sand, nothing will change and then you'll have more problems down the track,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set your finances on track, here are 10 ways to get money back into your pocket.\n\n\n\n1. Sell unwanted presents or other items around the house\n\nNot every present you receive at Christmas will be useful or something you like, and Baker said these items can be sold on places like Facebook Marketplace.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to keep every present you receive. Decluttering your home can also help boost your bank balance. Source: Getty / Cavan Images RF \"Use that money to clear credit cards or Buy Now Pay Later schemes,\" Baker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone wants to give ... but people don't [always] have room for more stuff, or it's not what they want.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also sell other items around your house that you no longer need, which gets rid of clutter and makes room for new things you may have received.\n\n\n\n2. Target your most costly debts\n\nIf you have racked up debt on your credit cards, Baker suggested paying off the debts with the highest interest rates first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make sure you're paying something off everything, but try and get [down the debts with the highest rates] first,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said it was worth analysing your spending plan for the next month or so, to work out how much money you can put on these debts to clear them quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If your mortgage interest rate is 6 per cent but your credit card is 20 per cent ... you might want to try and use anything you've got in your offset account or your redraw to clear those other debts as quickly as possible,\" she said.\n\n\n\n3. Take advantage of 0 per cent balance transfers\n\nMany banks offer 0 per cent interest rate balance transfer deals to get customers to shift their credit card debt. They provide a period of months or even years without interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaker said these can be useful as long as you pay your debt off and don't keep adding to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got to use this opportunity to clear that debt as quickly as possible,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also ring your bank and ask to be put on a lower interest rate or move the debt to a card offering a better deal.\n\n\n\nInterest on credit card debt can be high, so it's important to pay them off quickly. Source: Getty / d3sign Converting the debt into a personal loan could be an option, as it will force you to pay it off over a set period and you won't be able to add to it.\n\n\n\n4. Reassess your mortgage or car loan\n\nWith further rate cuts unlikely in the foreseeable future , it is a good time to review your mortgage and consider refinancing options.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the financial comparison site Canstar, the average owner-occupier variable rate in December was 5.51 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are paying more, or even just under this rate, you can ask your bank for a better deal or consider going elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may also be the right time to shift part of your mortgage to a fixed rate, with Canstar noting the number of banks offering fixed rates below 5 per cent had dropped amid expectations of rate increases this year.\n\n\n\nBut Canstar data insights director Sally Tindall said it was important to analyse the numbers carefully when fixing your rate and to shop around, as offers can vary widely.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaker said refinancing a mortgage or car loan could free up cash flow you can use to pay off other debts, such as credit card debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may also make sense to consolidate all debts, so you have just one repayment and use any extra money to pay that back as quickly as possible. This may also save you on separate annual fees for each debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut discharging a mortgage can be costly and Baker said it was important to look at all the fees to make sure it is worth doing.\n\n\n\n5. Generate short-term income\n\nTo pay down debt more quickly, Baker said short-term ways to earn money could be considered, such as taking jobs advertised on Airtasker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not like you are going to be doing these jobs forever, [you're] just going to get rid of this 'hurt money' that's sitting around at the moment,\" she said.\n\n\n\nTaking on odd jobs such as dog walking can help you earn some quick income. Source: Getty / oatawa \"There's lots of needs out there at the moment \u2014 people are on holidays \u2014 they may need dogs walked or gardens looked after, some cleaning done or Ikea furniture put together, there's job opportunities out there.\"\n\n\n\n6. Review your subscriptions\n\nIt's easy to sign up for subscriptions \u2014 whether they are for streaming services like Netflix, fitness apps or media sites \u2014 and then forget about them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS finance editor Ricardo Goncalves suggests reviewing what you're actually paying for (looking through credit card statements can be a handy way to find forgotten charges) and then assessing whether you really use it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also consider dropping down a subscription tier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some providers have cheaper offers if you're willing to accept a bit of advertising,\" Goncalves said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE This is what your frequent flyer points are really worth\n\nYou could also rotate subscriptions for streaming services so you are not paying for all of them at the same time. For example, you could watch shows on your Netflix account for three months, then pause your subscription and activate a different service for the next few months.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save even more money, you can switch to free services like SBS On Demand instead.\n\n\n\n7. Use your reward points\n\nOne advantage of excessive Christmas and holiday shopping is that it can help boost reward points for loyalty schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanstar notes that 100,000 Everyday Rewards or Flybuys points currently translates into $500 off your Woolworths or Coles shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it can be satisfying to see your balance increase, if you don't use your points, they could also lose value over time.\n\n\n\n8. Check for unclaimed money\n\nThe NSW government is holding around $300 million in unclaimed money, Goncalves said, and other states are also holding money owed to residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis money may be from businesses that have been unable to contact you because you\u2019ve moved, changed your name, or they've lost your paperwork.\n\n\n\nTo check if you have unclaimed money, you can use the unclaimed money search on ASIC's Moneysmart website .\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also check state databases on the relevant websites below:\n\n\n\n9. Slash your bills\n\nThe average family of four spending $260 a week on groceries can potentially save more than $2,000 a year by switching half of their weekly shop to cheaper brands at the supermarket, Canstar research has found.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther tips to save money on groceries include making a weekly meal plan so food doesn't go to waste, cooking from scratch rather than buying pre-packaged and processed foods, using recipes with few ingredients, and cooking larger batches so you can enjoy leftovers.\n\n\n\nMaking food from scratch and buying cheaper brands can save you money. Source: Getty / Tang Ming Tung Goncalves also suggests looking at your electricity bill to see if there are better deals available. The Australian government has its own comparison website called Energy Made Easy, which can help.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily vouchers can also be a good way to save money.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll state governments offer vouchers to encourage participation in recreational activities, including sports, arts and cultural events. Most of these are aimed at children, but Tasmania also offers vouchers for older Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these vouchers are renewed at the start of the new year. Information is available on the relevant websites below:\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Embrace freebies\n\nNowadays, libraries can offer access to a wide range of items, including toys and audiobooks, as well as digital movies, magazines, books and children's resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also tool libraries that allow you to borrow ladders, angle grinders, circular saws, as well as cleaning, garden, kitchen and camping equipment (although you may have to subscribe for some of these).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth checking your local council's website to see what free programs it offers residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nSites like Facebook Marketplace or local buy/swap/sell pages also offer items for free.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom clean eating to carnivore muffins - hint, there's no bread involved - to vegan meal prep, Fodmap diets and a hundred other ways of eating, the internet is awash with dietary advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of it's good - from experts, people like doctors, scientists and accredited dietitians - but a lot of it comes from people who don't have any medical training at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that, say medical experts, is part of the reason an increasing number of people are now mixing up various diet plans at the same time in what has become known as 'diet stacking'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Diet stacking is essentially where we see someone accumulate diets or follow multiple diets at the same time. So for example, someone might be vegetarian, so they're following certain dietary restrictions related to being vegetarian. And then they also decide, for example, that they're having some gut symptoms and they try a diet to improve their gut symptoms. So they're basically layering two different diets at the same time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Swinburne University dietetics expert Dr Caroline Tuck.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is one of the authors of a review paper that's recently been published looking at the rising incidence of diet stacking.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's proving to be a challenge for gastroenterologists and dietitians in managing chronic disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother co-author is Monash University\u2019s Sarah Melton, who is also a dietician.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she is seeing a growing number of people in her work following multiple diet plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore commonly people will start a gluten and dairy free diet - sometimes without evidence of any intolerance to these foods and without considering whether these diets are even needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well gluten- and dairy-free can be demonised a little bit across multiple different health conditions or for health generally. So in my experience working with patients, I would see those two more commonly as the initial things that people may restrict just because someone else might've said to them they felt better not eating gluten or not consuming dairy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Melton says new eating fads are always emerging, adding another layer to what has already become a complicated mix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've seen the full spectrum. I suppose one of the dietary approaches that the approach itself, I guess, is eliminating so many diets that arguably it's in a way stacking multiple different dietary restrictions together is the carnivore diet. And this is certainly becoming popularised through social media and is very concerning to clinicians in terms of the things that we're excluding, the nutritional implications and your overall health. So if you're excluding all fibre from the diet, all fruits, vegetables, grains, that starts to become, obviously not nutritionally complete and has potential for increasing risk of other conditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Caroline Tuck says unsupervised diet-stacking can precipitate discorded eating.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could also lead to chronic conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers and poor mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They might start to be inadequate in different types of nutrients, such as if they've gone dairy free and they're not having enough calcium sources, for example. So it can be that sort of real nutrient inadequacy, but sometimes it can also then lead to mental health challenges because then they're worried about eating out with friends or they're not going to social occasions or they're going to social occasions but not eating and that can really impact your mental health. We know that food is so much more than just nourishment: it's a really important part of our everyday life and socialisation and family gatherings. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother issue emerging is that medical professionals are finding it hard to diagnose intolerances because people may have already eliminated the suspect foods through diet stacking without medical supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common elimination diet to diagnose intolerances is the FODMAP diet.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash University defines FODMAPs as a group of sugars that are not completely digested or absorbed in our intestines.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people, especially those with irritable bowel syndrome, have problems digesting these causing sensations of pain, discomfort and other symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Melton says people following multiple diets is making it difficult to diagnose some common conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that's definitely something that's of concern to us. So this may be someone particularly with gastrointestinal symptoms seeks out a dietary intervention for that, of which there are many with very good evidence, and they may see a benefit in the institution of that diet that relieves some of their symptoms. But if they haven't had baseline screening to exclude organic drivers of symptoms or red flags, I guess that would warrant further investigation, there's that missed opportunity where a diagnosis may be missed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example a person who may have a family history of colon cancer and has noticed changes in their bowel habits may choose to avoid a colonoscopy, believing their diet is protecting them from the cancer and the need for screening.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the opposite may occur - a young person with constipation as a result of a keto diet might be asked to have a colonoscopy that may not be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Daisy Coyle is a Research Fellow at The George Institute, and an accredited dietitian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You want to give yourself the best chance in life and following a healthy diet's one of the risk factors that we can control. But it doesn't mean that just because you have a healthy diet, you will never get, say, bowel cancer. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. It's going to give you the best chance of not getting bowel cancer, but there are other factors that of course come into play, but it doesn't replace getting that expert help, getting those diagnoses that you need like a colonoscopy or even for your skin. If we think about our skin, you can wear sunscreen, you can wear sunglasses, you can wear a hat, you can sit in the shade, you can do all the things that you're meant to do, but it doesn't mean that you don't need to ever get a skin check.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Coyle says a healthy diet is the opposite of being restrictive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't want to restrict anything. You want an abundance of food. That's the purpose of having a healthy diet. You want to be having a diet rich in lots of different sources of fruits, lots of different sources of vegetables, all different types of dairy, cheese, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, different types of meat, eggs and chicken and fish and red meat and olive oil and nuts. You want to be providing your body and your gut microbiome with heaps of varieties so that you're giving yourself the best chance of getting great nutrient exposure, nutrient absorption, and really build up those probiotics and probiotics in your gut. And these diets really go against that and create this feeling of a healthy diet means it has to be restrictive in some way, and that's not the truth at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nScience is making great leaps in personalising nutrition for people, but Dr Caroline Tuck says we are not quite there yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know from a research perspective, we're hoping in the future that we can be more personalised in terms of looking at measures like your microbiome and the bacteria that lives in our gut. We know it's linked to a lot of things, but the research is not quite there for us to use that on a real personal level yet. But I think that's definitely what the research is driving towards and what we're hopeful for. But even now with what we do have, in a clinic situation, we're always trying to personalise recommendations and ensuring that any dietary changes are done safely.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tuck says the first place to start for people concerned about eating is with a medical professional like a gastroenterologist or dietitian.\n\n\n\n",

The figure is above the RBA's two to three per cent target band, but is consistent with their November forecast.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso key to RBA deliberations will be the December quarter inflation report, set for release on 28 January \u2014 days before the central bank's board is scheduled to meet on 2-3 February.\n\n\n\nAMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver says the RBA will be concerned by stickier items like the cost of building a new home, which is \"accelerating\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"New dwelling inflation was up 2.8 per cent on a year ago, compared to 1.7 per cent in October on a year ago,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So that's still a red flag there with new dwelling construction prices, which are continuing to pick up pace, so that will concern the RBA.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that although market services didn't go up, they remained too high at around 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n'Still too high': What does this mean for interest rates?\n\nRichard Holden, Scientia Professor of Economics at UNSW Business School, said the inflation data showed the cost of items still went up, but the growth had slowed slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's telling us that inflation is still too high,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA are going to have to do something to get it under control. And today's figures don't change that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked whether this points to an interest rate hike, Holden said it remains on the cards.\n\n\n\n\"It certainly could, and a lot of economists are suggesting that rates will need to go up. So if you thought that they were going to go up before this number, I wouldn't change my mind,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver, relieved by the drop, predicts a hold but admits \"they're not great numbers\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're still too high. The Reserve Bank will still be nervous. It keeps alive the prospect of a rate hike in February,\" Oliver said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the December quarter CPI figures will be a better predictor for the RBA's February meeting.\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers welcomes the CPI data, which was better than economists predicted. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Treasurer Jim Chalmers said while he understood Australians were still feeling the pinch of competing costs, the CPI results were \"very welcome and very encouraging\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that households are still under pressure and that\u2019s why our responsible cost of living relief is so important,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Inflation remains much lower than we inherited from the Coalition but still higher than we would like.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Smith, partner at Deloitte Access Economics, highlighted that the new data comes with \"wide margins of error\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the RBA should be \"careful and cautious, rather than impulsive\", arguing a cash rate increase would be \"premature\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the RBA feels it has no choice to hike rates, then it is a sad indictment on the failure of policymakers to address the root causes through reform.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank held the cash rate at 3.6 per cent following its board meeting in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its decision, the central bank's governor Michele Bullock said it was unlikely there would be further interest rate cuts \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nLarvotto Resources has again underlined the growth potential of its Hillgrove antimony-gold project in New South Wales after diamond drilling at the company\u2019s Clarks Gully prospect returned further high-grade mineralisation at depth, along strike and to the north - with a dash of tungsten for good measure. The company drilled three near-mine exploration holes at the target during October and November 2025, completing more than 500 metres of drilling. The program was designed to test the depth and strike extensions of known antimony-gold mineralisation, with a focus on potential splays and parallel lodes. The program was also used to validate geophysical targets identified in earlier surveys. Standout intercepts included 6.4 metres at a hefty 12.92 grams per tonne (g/t) gold equivalent from 208m, with 4.1 metres of that interval grading an eye-catching 19.76g/t gold equivalent. That hole intersected what the company believes could be a new parallel lode in the footwall of the main Clarks Gully structure, pointing to additional near-mine growth potential and warranting further follow-up drilling. \u2018The results from Clarks Gully have strengthened our understanding of the mineralised system.\u2019 Larvotto Resources managing director Ron Heeks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother hole returned 8m going 8.35g/t gold equivalent from 160m, including a blistering 1.6-metre slice running at 22.81g/t gold equivalent from 160.4m. The second drill hole targeted an untested resistivity anomaly in the northern part of the Clarks Gully system, with results confirming mineralisation directly associated with the geophysical response. Notably, Larvotto says the newly identified zone remains open, highlighting further upside. Drilling at Larvotto Resources\u2019 Hillgrove project, just west of Armidale in NSW. Beyond gold and antimony, drilling also delivered encouraging tungsten results associated with the antimony-gold lodes. Notable intercepts included 0.4m grading 2.97 per cent tungsten from 192.4m and 2.4m running at 1.53 per cent tungsten trioxide from 60.9m. Hillgrove already hosts a tungsten resource of 4774 tonnes of contained tungsten at a grade of 0.05 per cent, predominantly within the Freehold and Brackins Spur prospects, both of which remain open for expansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarvotto Resources managing director Ron Heeks said: \u201cThe results from Clarks Gully have strengthened our understanding of the mineralised system, confirming both the continuity of antimony and gold mineralisation to the north and high-grade zones at depth.\u201d Larvotto says the drilling and geological data collected have significantly improved its understanding of the controls on mineralisation and reinforced the system\u2019s potential to grow both north and south along strike. Further drilling at Clarks Gully is planned in 2026. The company currently has four diamond drill rigs operating across the Hillgrove project, with active programs underway at its Metz and Freehold prospects. At Metz, drilling is focused on defining the convergence of the Blacklode and Syndicate structures, testing extensions beneath historic workings and chasing multiple stacked, high-grade zones near existing underground infrastructure. At Freehold, drilling continues to probe historic workings and extensions to known mineralised structures, with additional testing planned at the company\u2019s Smiths, Freehold East and Swamp Creek prospects. Meanwhile, Larvotto\u2019s march towards production continues at pace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConstruction of its 525,000-tonne-per-annum processing plant is well advanced, with first gold and antimony pours slated for the second quarter of this year. The build is fully funded through a US$105 (A$158) million senior secured bond and a fresh A$60 million equity raise, locking in the A$140 million capital bill. The company also recently locked in MACA-Interquip-Mintrex to refurbish and expand the plant and appointed underground mining specialist PYBAR under a four-year development contract. Hillgrove\u2019s proximity to Armidale, just over an hour by sealed road, gives Larvotto a clear logistical and cost advantage. The regional centre offers an established workforce, accommodation, services and transport links. Meanwhile, existing road access, power and communications infrastructure have helped reduce capital spend, streamline construction and allow mine equipment to roll in quickly as the project moves into production. With expected annual production of 40,500 ounces of gold, 4878 tonnes of antimony and a scheelite concentrate kicker, Larvotto looks to be positioning Hillgrove as one of the Western world\u2019s rare multi-commodity critical metals producers - just months from first pour.

Got it Share\n\nThe Australian sharemarket continued its lacklustre performance into lunchtime after US stocks wavered overnight as traders digested mixed economic data and took stock of shifting geopolitical risks amid a flurry of social media posts from President Donald Trump. The S&P/ASX 200 inched up 11.70 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 8707.30 at 12.01pm AEDT. Gains by tech stocks held the bourse in the green, while miners wobbled. The flattish trade comes after the market eked out a small gain in the previous session, continuing its sluggish start to the new year, with the S&P/ASX 200 edging up 0.2 per cent. The Australian dollar was trading at US67.24\u00a2. Wall Street lacked direction overnight, prompting meagre gains on the local bourse this morning. Bloomberg The bourse didn\u2019t take any more direction from the balance of trade for November. Australia\u2019s trade surplus narrowed to $2.94 billion, down from a revised $4.35 billion in October after a fall in iron ore exports, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Tech stocks tracked overnight gains by the US tech giants, which benefited as this week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas boosts optimism about the sector. WiseTech Global, Australia\u2019s biggest tech stock, was up 2.8 per cent. Fellow software makers Xero and Technology One rose 2 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. Data centre operator Next DC rose 1 per cent and family tracking app Life360 climbed 2.4 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Mergers & acquisitions BlueScope Steel knocks back Stokes-led $13 billion takeover bid The big four banks were mixed. Commonwealth Bank, the biggest stock on the local market, slipped 0.2 per cent and ANZ Bank edged down 0.1 per cent, while Westpac (up 0.8 per cent) and National Australia Bank (up 0.5 per cent) saw modest gains. The mining sector\u2019s losses widened after the balance of trade figures. BHP and Fortescue Metals gave up early gains and were down 0.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent. Gold miners Northern Star (down 2.4 per cent) and Evolution Mining (down 0.6 per cent) declined and silver miner South32 shed 0.9 per cent after gold and silver prices softened overnight. BlueScope Steel lost 1.2 per cent to $29.50 after the nation\u2019s largest steelmaker knocked back a $13 billion takeover bid by Kerry Stokes\u2019 industrial group SGH and US steel giant Steel Dynamics last night, dismissing their $30-per-share offer as \u201can attempt to take BlueScope from its shareholders on the cheap\u201d. Ansell shares plunged 5 per cent after the rubber gloves maker said its chief executive Neil Salmon will retire after 13 years with the company. He will be replaced next month by Finnish executive Nathalie Ahlstr\u00f6m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Hardie slumped 3.8 per cent, mirroring sharp losses by US homebuilders after Trump suggested moves to prevent large institutional investors from buying single-family homes to make it more affordable for people to buy houses. The potential removal of some buyers for homes weighed on the Australian building products maker as it makes three quarters of its sales in the US. On Wall Street overnight, optimism faded after the US president\u2019s latest flurry of social media posts sent homebuilders and defence contractors tumbling. Valero Energy led shares of refiners higher after Trump said Venezuela would turn over millions of barrels of oil to the US. The S&P 500 Index slid 0.4 per cent after notching its second intraday record of 2026, while the Nasdaq 100 edged up 0.2 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9 per cent from its own record set the day before. Northrop Grumman slid 5.5 per cent and Lockheed Martin lost 4.8 per cent after Trump said he would not permit dividends or stock buybacks for defence companies until they fix problems with the production of military equipment. He didn\u2019t mention specific companies. Meanwhile, tech stocks continued their gains. Nvidia and Microsoft rose about 1 per cent each, and Alphabet rose more than 2 per cent as investors shifted back into AI stocks following recent worries they were overvalued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInvestors have come into 2026 with a similar playbook to last year: Buy tech and forget about it. Rumours that the AI trade was done turned out not to be true,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Moves across the rest of the US sharemarket were mostly quiet, including for Warner Bros Discovery after it again rejected a buyout bid from Paramount and told its shareholders to stick with a rival offer from Netflix. Warner Bros rose 0.3 per cent, while Paramount Skydance fell 0.9 per cent and Netflix added 0.1 per cent. In the oil market, crude prices fell after Trump said that Venezuela would provide 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States. A barrel of benchmark US crude dropped 2 per cent to $US55.99. Brent crude, the international standard, fell a more modest 1.2 per cent to settle at $US59.96 per barrel. Any additional oil flowing from Venezuela into the global system would push down on crude prices by increasing their supplies. Prices for oil have swung this week following Trump\u2019s weekend ouster of the president of Venezuela, which is likely sitting on some of the largest deposits of oil in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOil prices had already fallen back to where they were in 2021, before Trump\u2019s move against Venezuela, because of expectations of plentiful supplies. To pull much more oil from Venezuela\u2019s ground would likely require big investments to improve ageing infrastructure.

One of the most impactful said that growth for US retailers, finance companies and other businesses in the services sectors accelerated by more last month than economists expected. Separate reports on the US job market offered a mixed view. One said that employers cut back on the number of job openings they were advertising, while a second suggested that employers outside of the government added 41,000 more jobs last month than they cut. A much more comprehensive look at the health of the US job market will arrive on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.13 per cent from 4.18 per cent late on Tuesday following Wednesday\u2019s economic reports. But the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Fed will do, held steadier. It edged down to 3.46 per cent from 3.47 per cent from late Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hope on Wall Street is that the economy remains solid enough to avoid a recession but not so strong that it keeps the Fed from cutting interest rates. The Fed cut its main interest rate three times last year to shore up the slowing job market, but it\u2019s indicated fewer cuts may be ahead because inflation remains high. Traders are betting on a less than 12 per cent chance that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting later this month. That\u2019s down slightly from the day before, according to data from CME Group. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed among some sharp moves across Europe and Asia. with AP and Bloomberg\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.
