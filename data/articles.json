        "text": "Disability advocates are calling to have rideshare services included in state-based taxi subsidy schemes \ufeffwith 98 per cent of participants in a national trial saying they'd back the reform.\n\nCurrently, Victoria is the only state to include rideshare in its transport subsidy scheme for people with eligible disabilities.\n\nIn a recent 12-week trial of a provider-neutral scheme conducted by Uber and disability inclusion consultancy Get Skilled Access, participants were given Uber credits equivalent to their state subsidy to use however they wished.\n\nDisability advocates want rideshare services included in state-based taxi subsidy schemes. (AAP)\n\nThe results, released on Thursday, showed 95 per cent of participants felt Uber met their transport needs, 97 per cent felt it met their access needs, 96 per cent felt safe and 92 per cent felt independent and empowered in their daily lives.\n\nAlmost all (98 per cent) backed rideshare being included alongside taxis in subsidy schemes.\n\nCheryle Lapthorne, a small business owner, parent and carer, lives in regional Tasmania with her daughter Matilda, who uses a wheelchair and is neurodiverse.\n\nLapthorne has multiple sclerosis and mobility challenges of her own.\n\nShe told 9news.com.au the availability of taxis in their area does not meet demand.\n\nThe family also regularly uses public transport, particularly when travelling interstate for specialist healthcare.\n\n\"When you're a young person with a wheelchair that can be really difficult to manage and the cognitive load on the caregiver, to try and sort that out, particularly when you've got children that are disabled, you never quite know what card to buy, where to top it up, what tram system to get on, does it work, how far do I have to walk,\" she said.\n\n\"(The trial) was just a reminder that travel can be accessible and functional\ufeff.\n\n\"It has just really given us back the choice and control about how we travel\ufeff.\n\n\"People don't understand the functional impact that being denied transport has on someone who may no longer have any spoons left for the day or may not have another accessible way to get home.\ufeff\"\n\nCheryle Lapthorne and her daughter Matilda (Supplied)\n\nShe said access to rideshare would be pivotal in allowing Matilda, who is almost 13, to have independence.\n\nUber's \ufeffteen accounts allow teenagers to use the platform with consent and supervision from their legal guardian.\n\n\"She's able to pick where she wants to go and she's able to have a visual example of what that might look like on the screen, which is really accessible for her and calms the anxiety around 'where am I going?' and 'what am I doing?' for a neurodiverse person.\n\n\"\ufeffAs she grows, it will allow her to access the community in a meaningful way for her.\"\n\nMatilda's wheelchair folds down and can fit in a small car, which means she doesn't necessarily need the same size vehicle as other wheelchair users\ufeff either.\n\nLapthorne said having flexibility in what vehicle she uses means those services are available for others who need them.\n\n\"Not every disability is the same, so being able to have that choice and control about the need that meets you in that moment would probably be life-changing for a lot of people.\n\n\"Everybody should have the right to travel in the way that best suits them and allows them to join in the community.\"\n\nThe trial was backed by Vision Australia, Disability Voices Tasmania, Carers Australia, Children and Young People with Disability Australia.\ufeff\n\nResearch by Vision Australia shows almost 60 per cent of people with disability would be more likely to use subsidy schemes if rideshare was included.\n\n\"\ufeffFor people with disability, travel is often complex, stressful and requires a level of planning that most people never think about,\" Vision Australia's general manager of corporate affairs and advocacy Chris Edwards said.\n\n\"When choice is limited, that burden increases.\n\n\ufeff\"That's why we are calling for the urgent expansion of state subsidy schemes \u2014 a modest reform that would deliver life-changing impacts for our community.\"\n\nChris Edwards, Vision Australia's general manager of corporate affairs and advocacy said access to rideshare will be life-changing for people with disability. (Supplied)\n\nUber's general manager for Australia and New Zealand\ufeff said state-funded taxi subsidy schemes had not kept pace with Australians' travel habits.\n\n\"\ufeffThis trial shows what happens when people with disability get genuine choice.\n\n\"Victoria's provider-neutral model is a strong blueprint, and this trial adds to the case for other states to back funding that follows the person, not the transport mode\".",

(Supplied: DBCA)\n\nA 'diabolical' system\n\nLong-time camper Greg Murphy said the system crashed on both his attempts to book sites \u2014 once while trying to input credit card details.\n\nHe described the system as \"a nightmare\" with sites only available on non-consecutive nights, and said he would now book through commercial operators.\n\nMr Murphy said the new system still did not tackle the issue of \"no shows\" at the popular spots.\n\n\"It costs you $10 per person per day, so if they don't front up, what does it matter?\" he said.\n\nMany campsites in the Cape Range National Park are managed by the DBCA. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nMeanwhile, Busselton retiree David Wall, who travels to the area each year, said he eventually got through the booking queue after trying multiple times throughout the first day of the trial.\n\n\"There was a day here or a day there, but there was certainly nothing for a period of a week, so it certainly was a bit diabolical,\" he said.\n\n\"The old system certainly had flaws because people don't like sitting up at midnight \u2026 but you can plan your holiday,\" he said.\n\nMr Wall said he felt for those who had to work during the day and might have missed the 10am opening time.\n\n\"For the people who are working, why not make it 7pm?\"\n\nMesa campground is a popular site in the Cape Range National Park.

        "text": "When chef Nelize Pretorius felt her vision blurring \u2014 first one eye and then the other \u2014 it was initially brushed off as conjunctivitis.\n\nBut when the swab came back negative, her GP and hospital doctors struggled to understand what was making her eye inflammation progressively worse.\n\n\"I could hardly see,\" she said.\n\n\"I was losing my vision and nobody was able to tell me why.\"\n\nThe cause was nothing to do with the eye itself \u2014 instead it was due to a years-old tattoo on Ms Pretorius's back.\n\nThe condition, known as tattoo-associated uveitis, can lead to permanent vision loss, glaucoma, and patients requiring immunosuppressants for the rest of their life.\n\n\"You get a tattoo, and you think the risk is that you might regret it later in life,\" Ms Pretorius said.\n\n\"[The real risk is] you could potentially lose your vision.\"\n\nNelize Pretorius has spent thousands of dollars on treatments to protect her vision from deteriorating. (Supplied: Nelize Pretorius)\n\nWhile tattoo-associated uveitis was thought to be extremely rare, research published in the journal Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology has documented 40 new cases of the condition in Australia \u2014 doubling the number of published cases detected around the world since 2010.\n\nThe research, undertaken by a team of Australians, suggests this complication, while still rare given the number of people who get tattoos, may be more common than we thought.\n\nExperts are calling for more research to understand and try to limit the vision-threatening disease.\n\nEyes in the immune 'crossfire'\n\nJosephine Richards, the ophthalmologist who treated Ms Pretorius is no stranger to immune diseases.\n\nWorking in the field of eye inflammation, she's seen plenty of cases of uveitis \u2014 a dangerous condition where immune mechanisms begin to damage the eye.\n\nIt can be a complication of autoimmune arthritis, and a number of other autoimmune diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks a part of the body.\n\nNelieze was unable to work at her job as a chef as her vision deteriorated. (Supplied: Nelize Pretorius)\n\nEarly symptoms of uveitis include blurred vision, light sensitivity, pain, and \u2014 if it is left untreated \u2014 glaucoma, and permanent vision loss.\n\n\"We do not know why the eye gets caught in the crossfire,\" Dr Richards said.\n\n\"There is something about the immune reaction that targets the eye.\"\n\nDo tattoos increase your risk of cancer? While most people worry about the pain of tattooing, studies suggest that being inked may increase the chance of health issues down the track.\n\nBut in recent years, Dr Richards has seen a rise in cases of uveitis caused by injected tattoo ink \u2014 sometimes long after the tattoo was done.\n\nDoctors can tell the uveitis is caused by a tattoo because it can look slightly raised and inflamed.\n\n\"I only became aware of it about four or five years ago, and then once I was aware of it, I had all these patients all of a sudden,\" she said.\n\nAnd she wasn't the only eye doctor seeing this.\n\nAt a conference of ophthalmologists interested in eye inflammation, the specialists realised that many of them were being referred cases of young people with tattoos who had ended up with this same issue.\n\n\"So we said, 'OK, we better look at this and see if it's becoming more common.'\"\n\n\"And just since our last conference [in November 2025] we've got four more cases in Western Australia. Probably the other states have got more too.\"\n\nIn the recently published research, most cases of tattoo-associated uveitis needed to go on long-term treatment including immunosuppression, and only three of the patients had no vision loss throughout the treatment.\n\nMs Pretorius continues to use steroid eye drops, and has spent thousands of dollars on treatment. She remains in touch with Dr Richards to deal with regular flare-ups.\n\n\"What really worries us is that we're just not managing to get these people off the drugs,\" Dr Richards said.\n\n\"Usually with an immune disease, we treat for two years and then slowly wind back treatment and hope that the person's going to be OK off the treatment. But mostly we're not managing to wind back the treatment.\"\n\nWhy is this occurring?\n\nWhile it is unknown exactly what causes some tattoos to produce this reaction, the new research offers some clues.\n\nOf the people with tattoo-associated uveitis studied in the paper, it was mostly black ink tattoos that seemed to have caused the inflammation, but pink and red ink was also recorded in one case each.\n\nIn most of the cases it was also long after the tattoo had been completed, on average around a year or two, but in one case up to 35 years after the tattoo was done.\n\nAccording to Dr Richards, some, but not all people, had their tattoos done overseas, including in Bali.\n\nThis makes it particularly difficult for researchers to work out what in the ink might cause this reaction.\n\n\"It is just so hard to find out what dye was used,\" she said.\n\nDr Richards said it was important to be able to identify why the dyes caused the reaction.\n\n\"I hope we will understand why it's happening and be able to identify what it is about the dyes that are triggering it and take those out of the mix,\" she said.\n\nWhile black inks seem to be present in most tattoo-related uveitis cases, it's also the most common ink used. (Getty Images: Rawpixel)\n\nDespite the increase in cases appearing over the past few years, Nicole Carnt, a vision scientist at the University of Sydney not involved with the research, noted that it was still a rare condition given about 20\u201330 per cent of Australians have at least one tattoo.\n\n\"There's millions of people who have tattoos and don't have any problems,\" she said.\n\n\"So what is triggering this in some people?\"\n\nBoth Dr Carnt and Dr Richards suggested genetic susceptibility and the microbiome might be involved.\n\nDr Richards said the condition looked very similar to an immune disease called sarcoidosis, where inflammatory cells clustered around the body in red swollen lumps.\n\n\"You can take a biopsy of an inflamed tattoo, and it looks almost the same as what you'd see in the chest with sarcoidosis,\" she said.\n\n\"With all immune diseases, there is some genetic predisposition \u2014 some way that your immune system deals with the world \u2014 and then you get exposed to something and that sets you off,\" she added.\n\nDr Richards noted that those with a familial risk of immune diseases like sarcoidosis might be more likely to have this tattoo-associated infection occur.\n\nHow to make tattoos safer\n\nThe researchers are well aware they are unlikely to convince people to stop getting inked, especially for a rare disease that may occur years down the track.\n\n\"So many people get tattooed, and I feel like it would be very hard to stop people from doing it,\" Dr Richards said.\n\nEven Ms Pretorius wasn't sure if her younger self would be convinced.\n\n\"I don't know if 18-year-old Nelize would have listened but 33-year-old Nelize certainly would,\" she said.\n\nInstead, Dr Richards hoped to focus on what in the inks might cause this, and trying to ensure it could be removed.\n\n\"If you were able to make it safer, that would be the best outcome for everybody.\"\n\nDr Carnt agreed, suggesting more research was needed to find out what was causing some people to be vulnerable but not others.\n\nABC Health in your Instagram feed Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.\n\nDr Richard is also working on ensuring that more people, and their doctors, know about this disease, so they can be referred and treated faster.\n\n\"It wouldn't change the decision for many people. Some of my tattooed patients that are on immunosuppression still carry on having tattoos because that is so important to them,\" she said.\n\n\"But I would like people to at least know.\"\n\nDespite having a condition that she jokes \"sounds made up\", Ms Pretorius feels lucky her situation isn't worse.\n\n\"I think that my case in particular, was one of the first cases that Dr Richards had in Perth,\" she said.\n\n\"It's just lucky that she knew about it because if she wasn't there on that day, I may still not know what the issue is.\n\n\"There's a few people [with tattoo-associated uveitis] that lost their vision permanently, so relatively speaking I came off pretty good.\"",

It was a pretty vicious one, to be honest.\n\n\"The relationship with food and stuff was horrendous and body image and shocking.\n\n\"When I had a broken leg, so I'm on crutches all off season and I didn't hit my skinny targets, so I'm in fat club for pre-season.

(ABC Kimberley: Dunja Karagic)\n\nHe was told he could not return to Broome without a dialysis chair, but there were no chairs available due to high demand.\n\nWithout an established patient dying, moving or receiving a transplant, he was effectively stuck.\n\n\"They had no space in Broome,\" Mr Lawford said.\n\n\" I was [in Perth] for months \u2026 until someone passed away in Broome dialysis so I can have a chair. \"\n\nThe toll of distance\n\nWith no family in Perth, Mr Lawford said his time in the city was a lonely experience.\n\n\"They always asked me at the hospital, 'Do you got any family?'\" he said.\n\n\"I said, 'No'.\n\n\" It's just you and the hospital \u2026 family-wise, there was no-one there. \"\n\nDavid Lawford would like to see the Broome renal facility expanded. (ABC Kimberley: Dunja Karagic )\n\nMr Lawford said a dialysis patient known to him in Broome died late last year, enabling him to return to the clinic.\n\nWhile now reunited with his family, he said he had missed out on experiences he could never get back.\n\n\"I missed so many funerals all that time I was down at Perth,\" he said.\n\n\"Especially family and other mob that you have respect for, I missed out on a lot.\n\n\"It's really sad, especially them ones you know really well.\"\n\nA widespread issue\n\nMr Lawford's experience is not unique.\n\nKimberley Renal Services (KRS), a subsidiary of Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services (KAMS), provides care to more than 165 patients in the region.\n\nWhen Mr Lawford was in Perth in September last year, there were 14 Kimberley patients on the KRS waitlist also receiving dialysis in the metropolitan area, according to KAMS data.\n\nBetter investment in local renal facilities has been a long-standing issue in the Kimberley, with many state and federal government promises plagued by delays.\n\nLast year, a KAMS spokesperson said the establishment of Renal Health Centres in Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Derby and Kununurra had \"significantly improved access\".\n\nBut more support was needed for key services such as a mobile dialysis unit that visited remote communities, a transplant program and employing more Aboriginal care coordinators.\n\nThe 10-bed Kimberley Renal Services unit was established in Broome in 2002. (ABC Kimberley: Dunja Karagic )\n\nWhile Mr Lawford questioned why Broome's facilities were not expanded, the more pressing question on his mind was how long it would take until he could live his life without dialysis.\n\nFigures show more than 20 patients received a kidney transplant through the KAMS program since 2020, with more than 1,500 people on a growing waitlist for a kidney in Australia.\n\n\"All dialysis mob here in Broome, they're just minding you until you die \u2014 that's no good,\" Mr Lawford said.\n\n\"The question everyone in dialysis is asking [is],'Have you found a kidney for me?'\n\n\"I'm waiting and I'm asking too, the same as everybody else.\"\n\nIn a statement, WA Health Minister Meredith Hammat said the government continued to expand access to renal facilities in the Kimberley, with a newly expanded Fitzroy Crossing Renal Health Centre opening last month, planning for the Halls Creek Renal Facility currently in the design development phase, and a new renal hostel in the works for Broome.\n\n\"We are working closely \u2026 with KAMS to improve access to healthcare for Aboriginal people in the Kimberley,\" Ms Hammat said.",

        "text": "Australia and the European Union (EU) are on the cusp of finally reaching a free trade agreement after years of sometimes fraught negotiations, with both sides increasingly optimistic that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and EU President Ursula von de Leyen will be able to sign a deal within weeks.\n\nTalks have long been stalled after collapsing spectacularly in 2023, and Trade Minister Don Farrell has been adamant Australia will not sign a deal unless the EU agrees to tear down tariff barriers to larger quantities of agricultural exports such as beef and lamb.\n\nBoth sides have also been negotiating over working rights and labour mobility, Australia's luxury car tax, and the use of geographical indicators that could stop Australian producers using labels such as \"fetta\" and \"prosecco\".\n\nEarlier this week Senator Farrell flew to Brussels for talks with EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen, as both sides try to break the deadlock and strike a blow for free trade in the face of global economic fragmentation and the Trump administration's tariff assault.\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell (right) is hoping to increase trade with the EU, Australia\u2019s third-largest trading partner. (Supplied: Minister for Trade and Tourism)\n\nSources from the EU and Australia said the deal was now close.\n\nMr Albanese and Ms von de Leyen now have to resolve one outstanding issue \u2014 believed to be connected to red meat exports \u2014 before the deal can officially be signed.\n\nIn a joint statement, Senator Farrell and the EU commissioners said the talks were \"constructive and positive\" and \"allowed the two sides to converge positions on a range of issues\".\n\n\"Good progress was achieved in narrowing gaps on a small number of outstanding matters,\" the statement said, adding they would take the offer to Mr Albanese and Ms von der Leyen respectively for sign off.\n\nEU nations are collectively already Australia's third-biggest trading partner, and the deal could help further open the 450 million-strong market to Australian producers, delivering a major win to the federal government and, potentially, a significant boost to GDP.\n\nIt would also help reinforce the strategic relationship with Australia and the EU \u2014 which are already close to finalising a separate security partnership \u2014 in the face of global turmoil.\n\nAgriculture access a sticking point\n\nBut farmers' groups in Australia have been fiercely critical of Europe's generous agricultural subsidies, and have urged the federal government to reject any deal that does not provide \"significantly increased access\" for Australian agricultural exports.\n\nThe European Union and member states are also likely to face political pressure from European farmers, with one prominent lobbying group warning earlier this week that the pact should not \"expose EU farmers to intensified competition in already fragile markets\".\n\nSenator Farrell said he was confident both sides would \"reach agreement that benefits both of our economies\".\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly, any agreement must be in Australia's national interest and provide real benefit for Australian business, producers, exporters and workers,\" he said.\n\nMs von der Leyen is widely expected to travel to Australia to sign the free trade deal and the security partnership, but it is not yet clear exactly when she will make the trip.",

        "text": "Oscar Piastri has raised concerns about safety issues at the upcoming Australian Grand Prix, worried about potential chaos at the very start of the F1 season opener.\n\nThe McLaren ace warned it sounded like \"a recipe for disaster\" to have the sport's new-look \"low downforce\" cars, still untested in race conditions, jostling for position, and he also brought up uncertainties surrounding overtaking.\n\nPiastri noted his concerns after a successful but long day behind the wheel of his new McLaren on Friday, during which he churned out 161 laps \u2014 more than anyone else \u2014 and finished fourth-fastest in the standings behind a Mercedes 1-2 led by Kimi Antonelli.\n\nPiastri believes his concerns will need to be looked at before his home grand prix in Melbourne in three weeks when the first race will take place since F1's cars, rules and regulations were completely revised.\n\n\"Starts need to be addressed because, probably as we've all seen, it's a pretty complicated process now to have a safe start, let alone a competitive one,\" he said after the final session of the first official preseason testing at the Sakhir circuit.\n\nVerstappen says new F1 cars are not fun to drive Four-time Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen says the 2026 cars are \"not so fun\", claiming the increasing energy management demands on drivers are \"just not Formula 1\".\n\n\"There's plenty of topics to address. Starts, and overtaking is certainly going to be different as well.\n\n\"Whether we use straight mode at the start or not, as well.\n\n\"I think a pack of 22 cars with a couple hundred points less downforce sounds like a recipe for disaster to me, but there's a few of those aspects that need to be spoken about.\n\n\"The thing is, everyone's going to need different things for the start, and to be completely honest with you, I'm not sure any of us know exactly what we need yet.\n\n\"There's so many things just from an even borderline safety point of view that need to be kind of figured out on track, that do need addressing.\"\n\nPiastri was talking to reporters after the drivers went through a practice start in Bahrain, which turned into a fairly chaotic exercise.\n\nHe said that wasn't connected to the new engines but to a miscommunication.\n\nThe Australian had failed to get away in his McLaren but explained: \"I got told to wait until whoever was in front of me had gone and then do my own launch, and not do it to the lights.\n\n\"Clearly, some other people had a different idea. So that was nothing to do with the power units.\"\n\nAs for his verdict on which teams looked most powerful over the week \u2014 McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari all seemed their usual powerhouse selves \u2014 he shrugged: \"Where we are in the pecking order, I don't know.\n\n\"It kind of looks like the top-four teams are still the top-four teams, but I don't know where exactly we sit in that at the moment.\"\n\nMercedes's George Russell, second-fastest on Friday ahead of Ferrari's third-fastest Lewis Hamilton, was still adamant Red Bull had a \"pretty scary\" advantage over the rest as Max Verstappen finished fifth on the time sheets.\n\nRed Bull, in turn, reckoned Mercedes looked impressive as the pre-Melbourne mind games started to get into gear.\n\nA second three-day testing session in Bahrain will be held from February 18-20, ahead of the Australian Grand Prix weekend on March 6-8.\n\nAAP",

(ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\nAs the place where he has lived all his life this year experienced its hottest day since records began in 1995, he pondered how summers had changed throughout his life.\n\nHe remembers a time before maximum temperatures were even recorded.\n\n\"There was no cooling. We didn't have a fan, we didn't have any air conditioning, we didn't have a refrigerator, we didn't have ice,\" Mr John recalled about life with his brothers and sister 90 years ago.\n\n\"After school we'd be in the creek \u2026 that's where we learnt to swim when the hot days were there.\"\n\nClarence \"Clack\" John says you can no longer swim in the creeks he did as a boy due to contamination. (ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\nEven escaping the heat by the river had its challenges.\n\n\"We would go camping up the river at the opening of the duck season, and I'd have a tent,\" he said.\n\n\"At night time, if you've shut the front of the tent up, you could hardly sleep in there. You'd stifle because of the heat.\n\n\"If you open the tent and let the air in, the mosquitoes would all come in and it wouldn't be very pleasant, so \u2026 sleeping outside was never an option for us.\"\n\nAir conditioners were not readily available until the latter half of the 20th century. (ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\nThese days Mr John enjoys the comfort of an air conditioner and a fan during the hot weather.\n\n\"Some people, I think, look back and think they were heroes, that they lived through the early days of the hot weather,\" he said.\n\n\"I remember quite vividly thinking, I used to see my mum and my sister out there picking grapes on hot days \u2026 'there's gotta be something better in life than what they're doing.'\"\n\nWhile he grew up on a fruit block with his family, Mr John spent 47 years as a pharmacist in the town.\n\nClarence \"Clack\" John was academic and awarded Dux of School in 1943. (ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\nBack then, the go-to prescription for a wide range of ailments, including heat stress, was aspirin.\n\n\"You'd often have mums coming in and say, 'The baby is crying most of the night,'\" Mr John said.\n\n\"All you could recommend to them was to get a towel and wet it and put it over the cot to try and keep the child cool.\n\n\"If you got very hot and got distressed about it, give them an aspirin, that's about the only thing that was available in those days.\n\n\"Paracetamol and those things have come along and medicine has changed totally since I started to the time I retired.\"\n\nThere was no vet in Renmark, so Clarence \"Clack\" John stepped in to help with his knowledge of medicine. (ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\nWhile he has watched so many changes in the community, Mr John said he was unsure if he had felt summers change, even on Renmark's hottest day.\n\n\"I went outside once for the day and I thought, 'This is unbearable,' but then I sort of thought about it actually and I can remember it being like this before, especially when we used to walk home from school,\" Mr John said.\n\nBut research tells a different story.\n\nIt keeps getting hotter\n\nRenmark hit a sweltering 49.6 degrees Celsius in January.\n\nIan Lowe, an emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, said that extreme heat was part of a trend of increasing temperatures.\n\n\"The last three years globally are the warmest years ever recorded,\" he said.\n\n\"There have been analyses that say that the Riverland and Murraylands are going to be more seriously affected than some other parts of Australia \u2026 more frequent heat extremes and longer periods of drought.\"\n\nIan Lowe says climate change needs to be abated or it will be more difficult to produce food. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nMr Lowe said it is a concerning outlook for the agricultural regions and Australia's future food security.\n\n\"Crops just can't cope with that level of heat,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not just bad in terms of needing to feed ourselves and farmers needing to have a good lifestyle \u2014 it's bad in terms of the economic impact on Australia if production from the rural areas is affected by climate change.\"\n\nHome forever\n\nReflecting on the seasons of his life, Mr John ponders the harshness of the weather in the desert-like climate of the Riverland, but also how deep his connection is to his town.\n\nClarence \"Clack\" John says he will never leave Renmark. (ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\n\"I don't know why I live in Renmark,\" he said.\n\n\"I hate the heat. I hate the cold. I'm not too sure about the spring time \u2014 it's windy.

        "text": "Jane Hume started the parliamentary term in the doldrums.\n\nThe Victorian senator and favourite of the media had been turfed from the opposition front bench by her \"friend\" Sussan Ley, after being tarred personally with much of what went wrong to deliver the Coalition its cataclysmic election loss.\n\nThe demotion had hurt, she conceded, but she also wasn't about to let it get her down.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t the playground, this is the parliament. I\u2019m not here to make friends. I\u2019m here to make a difference,\" she told morning television two days after Ley's first shadow cabinet was unveiled.\n\n\"As my very wise mother would say, 'Stop your nonsense, chin up, chest out, straighten your tiara and let's get on with the job.'\"\n\nOn Friday there was no tiara but a metaphorical crown as she ascended over three of her colleagues to be elected deputy Liberal leader, while the party ousted the woman that had orchestrated her move to the back bench just nine months earlier.\n\nThe Victorian senator beat three of her colleagues to become deputy leader. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nIt makes Hume the first senator to hold the title since 1990 and, depending on the portfolio she chooses for herself, that could mean some new horizons for the opposition to traverse.\n\nHume, along with new Liberal Leader Angus Taylor, made up Peter Dutton's economic team. Whether they can shake that association in the minds of voters, who emphatically rejected the party the last time around, remains to be seen.\n\n\"We know the challenge that faces us. We know that many people have lost faith,\" she told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"Our party and our movement has a proud history. In my role as deputy, I will make it my mission to ensure that it also has a bright future.\"\n\nFrom banker to parliamentarian\n\nHume, 54, was born in Melbourne and stayed in the city for her studies, earning a commerce degree at Melbourne University.\n\nShe entered the workforce as a graduate at NAB, before spending two decades moving between various roles in the banking and superannuation sector.\n\nAfter multiple attempts at Senate preselection, she was elected in fifth position on the Coalition ticket in 2016, behind now prominent frontbencher James Paterson.\n\nHer success at the ballot box came after a bleak period in her personal life. At a women's summit last year, she spoke of finding herself unemployed, recently divorced and a single mother of three.\n\n\"Were my parents thrilled? Absolutely not. Was I thrilled? No, not in the least,\" she said.\n\nHume, then a new senator, arrives at Parliament House in 2016. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty)\n\nThree years after joining parliament, Scott Morrison named the former super adviser as assistant minister for superannuation and financial services.\n\nHume got straight to work, telling the Sydney Morning Herald she sought to make urgent changes to the \"inefficient\" super system and reintroduce legislation to make it opt-in for those under 25 years of age.\n\nAfter the Coalition's 2022 defeat, the senator was appointed as the shadow minister for finance and the public service.\n\nShe was also tasked with helming the party's election review alongside former director Brian Loughnane, which recommended targets rather than formal quotas for female MPs, despite the party's poor result with women.\n\nIt was an issue she had some experience with. Long before being elected to the Senate, Hume had established a program to help mentor young women keen on entering politics.\n\n\"One of the tough things we have to do is convince our members and our colleagues that there is a business case for increasing the number of women in parliament,\" she told the ABC in 2017.\n\nBut she came under fire the following year for comments made during an episode of Q&A that suggested women who weren't able to break through the preselection process should simply work harder.\n\n\"We have to work for what we want,\" she said \"And for women that don\u2019t get there, well, the trick is work that little bit harder. Don\u2019t get bitter, get better.\"\n\nBlunders mar election campaign\n\nThe first sign of trouble for Hume came before the official election campaign. During a speech at the Menzies Research Centre she declared it would be an expectation of a Coalition government that \"all members of the APS [Australian Public Service] work from the office five days a week\".\n\nWhile there would be some exceptions, she said, \"they will be made where they work for everyone rather than be enforced on teams by an individual\".\n\nHume had apparently been inspired to float the proposal after a conversation with her son, who was working from home as an intern.\n\nHer comments were quickly met with backlash and Labor seized upon them to claim that everybody would be at risk of being forced back to the office if Dutton was elected.\n\nAngus Taylor and Jane Hume were Peter Dutton's economic team. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nThe policy was particularly poisonous among women, for whom the ability to work from home is often essential to being able to juggle a career and parenting responsibilities.\n\nSuch was the outrage that Dutton had to publicly abandon the position \u2014 a remarkable concession in the midst of an election.\n\n\"I think it was pretty clear during the election campaign that that policy was a mistake,\" she told reporters on Friday.\n\nIt was not her only election misstep. Two days before Australians went to the polls, she suggested on live television that there were \"Chinese spies\" volunteering for Labor.\n\nHow Liberal WFH crackdown came undone Jane Hume joked that the private sector might follow the Liberals in cracking down on work from home, but the party ran into trouble when voters came to fear the same.\n\nThe comment swiftly went viral on social media platforms popular with Chinese voters and prompted calls for the prominent Liberal to apologise.\n\nHume this week labelled the comment a \"throwaway line\" that had been taken out of context and blamed Labor for weaponising it.\n\n\"I have in fact, apologised to those that were offended by that,\" she said. \"They were ill-considered remarks.\"\n\nBoth fumbles were widely cited as key contributors to the Coalition's defeat \u2014 and Hume did not escape unscathed.\n\nBanished to the backbenches\n\nWith the wreck of the election still smouldering, Sussan Ley stood up in front of journalists and declared that the Liberal Party would go in a new direction, one that reflected modern Australia.\n\nThat new vision for the party apparently did not include Hume on the front bench, despite her status as a fundraising powerhouse.\n\nThe taxing 276 days of Sussan Ley's leadership Sussan Ley vowed to be a different opposition leader, one who consulted widely and listened to her broad church. But it left many wondering what, if anything, she stood for.\n\nThe high-profile senator was unceremoniously left off Ley's ministry, along with fellow Liberal woman Sarah Henderson. It meant the number of women on the front bench went backwards under Ley, even as she acknowledged the need to attract more women to the party.\n\nAsked about the snub, Ley described Hume as a \"strong performer across a range of different subject areas\" and an \"enormously talented, fantastic\" team member.\n\nHume kept quiet on the slight for two days, before turning to Sunrise to break her silence.\n\n\"If you\u2019re asking me whether I feel hurt or slighted by this move from Sussan, of course it hurts,\" she said.\n\n\"It hurts professionally because I was a hard-working and prolific member of the front bench in the previous opposition. It hurts personally, too, because you know, Sussan and I are friends.\"\n\nBut Hume also saw a silver lining: \"There is something very liberating about being on the back bench and being able to speak without having to stick to the party line and without having to stick to talking points.\"\n\nHume is known for her strong \u2014 and often entertaining \u2014 performances in Senate estimates. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nIndeed, despite being on the back bench, Hume managed to stay in the spotlight. She is known for her strong and often entertaining performances in Senate estimates, including one particularly memorable exchange with a witness who she often bumped into wearing lycra at the gym.\n\n\"Less worthy men have seen me in far less,\" she joked, before her own mouth dropped open seemingly in surprise at what had slipped out.\n\nIn the hearings this week, Hume questioned the Department of Parliament Services about why condoms were available in women's changing rooms but not men's. The public servant said she thought it was wonderful that women were taking control of their sexual health.\n\n\"I agree ... I just wonder why men aren't taking responsibility as well,\" Hume replied.",

Dreamed of. Attempted to manifest through hours of relentless training and personal advancement.\n\nGet the latest: Winter Olympics day seven: Baff claims stunning snowboard cross win Stay across the highs and lows of the Games with the ABC Sport Daily podcast and ABC Sport.\n\nNever mind that this silver medal made James the first Australian to win three medals at the Winter Olympics.\n\nNever mind that.\n\n\"It's a bit numb,\" a more composed James told media in the aftermath of the result.\n\n\"Like, I don't really know how to feel.\n\n\"I think that it all happens, and then you get a medal, and then you're walking around here, and I mean \u2026 \"\n\nScotty James has now stood on three Olympic podiums, but the top step still evades him. (Getty Images: Adam Pretty)\n\nIt is no surprise that James was so stunned.\n\nFor so much of this past olympiad James has been absorbed by the desire to claim the one prize that has eluded him, riven by a desire for gold that not even Tolkein's Smaug could match.\n\nIt has dictated his entire life.\n\nBut James should and will take solace in knowing that there was little more he could have done to realise his dream.\n\nWednesday's qualifying run promised a final for the ages and snowboard's greatest collection of talent in history duly delivered.\n\nThe threat was always going to come from the legion of dominant Japanese riders who have pushed the sport to greater heights than seemed possible.\n\nYuto Totsuka. Ruka Hirano. Ryusei Yamada.\n\nAll three laid down runs that just 12 months earlier would have seemed impossible to achieve, with Totsuka opening with back-to-back 1440s \u2014 that's a trick with four full rotations \u2014 and an eye-catching switch backside double alley-oop rodeo 900 stalefish, which feels difficult even to write, let alone perform as flawlessly as Totsuka managed to do.\n\nBut even Scotty James was skating at a level beyond anything he would have previously thought capable.\n\nScotty James may end up chasing the end of the rainbow for his whole career. (Getty Images: Nurphoto/Federico Manoni)\n\n\"It's been crazy. Watching the progression over the many, many years and the Olympics that I've gone to has been amazing,\" he said.\n\n\"And tonight, yeah, I mean, I don't think the progression has been that rapid in 12 months ever.\n\n\"There's times where I was like, 'I hope it slows down.' But it didn't.\n\n\"And look, I'm pushing it myself as well. I'm pushing it, so they're pushing it, so I'm as equally responsible.\n\n\"But it's been cool to be a part of it.\"\n\nPushing the boundary was a necessary requirement for James \u2014 or indeed anyone \u2014 to win gold.\n\nBut perhaps James was pushing too much, wanting his gold, sure, but wanting an emphatic statement to underline his superiority and ensure that everyone knew that he deserved it more than anyone else.\n\nIt could have cost him.\n\nOnly a minor execution error on an otherwise stunning second run perhaps denied him that golden finish.\n\nScotty James's second run was not flawless enough for him to win gold. (Reuters: Imagn Images/Nathan Ray Seebeck)\n\nBut that he had to rely on the second run was down to a miscalculation on the final hit of his first and third runs, and the final run ended with an extravagant attempted backside double cork 1620 Japan grab that he just couldn't stick when he needed to.\n\n\"I think my first run, if I landed that, I think the medal would have been a different colour,\" James said, almost wistfully.\n\n\"And then the last run was kind of for me, but \u2026 yeah, it's hard to kind of look at it like that because I can't change the result, but it is what it is.\"\n\nHad James kept that last hit to a 1440 instead, four full rotations instead of that extra half, maybe things would have been different.\n\n\"Potentially [I] could have done it with a 14,\" James said.\n\n\"But., for myself, I had to do the 16. I wanted to push it and that's what I was here to do, regardless of the result.\n\nScotty James knew his mistake on his final run was going to ensure he would not make the grade. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\n\"I think \u2026 from myself mostly, but we obviously all knew what I was coming here to do.\n\n\"And I wasn't really thinking about that so much. I was thinking about that run, that last run that I tried to do, and I wasn't able to land it, and it was really going to be for me that run.\n\n\"But I'll have to keep pushing it in the future, I guess.\"\n\nThe future. James is adamant that he can continue on to the French Alps in 2030.\n\nBut another four years of pushing the boundaries, now with a young son at home, may feel optimistic given the extraordinary talent coming up behind him.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nBut that's for another day.\n\nThe immediate future is far more certain.\n\n\"The next 24 hours I'll probably have a bit of a cry, but I'll be happy as well because representing the country and winning a medal is unbelievable and I'm really proud of that,\" James said.\n\n\"I think what I can live with is that I tried my best.\"\n\nIn the end, that's all anyone can ask. James's silver medal is the silver lining on a personal disappointment that only serves to illustrate the extraordinary standards to which he holds himself.\n\nThose may be unobtainable standards for now.\n\nBut never say never.",

        "text": "A petition to investigate the judging of the ice dance competition has been dismissed by the sport's governing body, as two injured Australians are forced home from the Games.\n\nHere are the quick hits from the Winter Olympics.\n\n1. Skating union stands by judge's controversial score\n\nEarlier this week, France claimed ice dance gold in one of the most controversial moments of the Games so far.\n\nLaurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron finished with an overall score of 225.82 in the free dance, with American silver medallists Madison Chock and Evan Bates hot on their heels with a total of 224.39.\n\nThe US felt aggrieved to miss out on a gold medal in the ice dance. (Getty Images: Matthew Stockman)\n\nThe French victory was heavily impacted by judge Jezabel Dabouis \u2014 who also happens to be French.\n\nDespite a terrific dance from the Americans and a seemingly less than perfect dance from the French, Dabouis favoured her compatriots by a margin of almost eight points.\n\nWithout Dabouis's score, the US figure skaters would have risen to the peak of the dais, with five of the nine judges favouring the Americans.\n\nSince then, more than 10,000 people have signed a Change.org petition urging the International Skating Union (ISU) and the International Olympic Committee to investigate the result.\n\nBut yesterday the ISU threw cold water on any suggestion of judging dishonesty, saying it had \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness\".\n\n\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" an ISU spokesperson said.\n\n2. Two Aussies forced to return home\n\nWhile the Aussie camp is still cheering loudly for Josie Baff and Cooper Woods, it's a different story for two of their peers.\n\nAustralian team officials confirmed Daisy Thomas had to make the difficult decision to withdraw from the freeski big air competition after consultation with her coach and the Australian Olympic medical team.\n\nDaisy Thomas was forced to pull out of her Olympic debut at Milano Cortina. (Getty Images: David Ramos)\n\nLast November, Thomas suffered a ruptured ACL during competition. After extensive rehab, time in the gym and getting mentally focused, Thomas returned to the World Cup circuit and was selected to make her Olympic debut.\n\nThen this month, she landed awkwardly during slopestyle training and after returning to official training, was unable to complete the session.\n\nMeanwhile, Aussie snowboarder Cam Bolton is returning to Melbourne after being airlifted to hospital after breaking his neck at the Winter Olympics two days ago.\n\nThe decision was made \u2014 after scans and assessment in Milan \u2014 that the best and safest line of management for Cam would be to return home.\n\nCameron Bolton of Australia at the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts)\n\n3. Ukrainian skeleton athlete Heraskevych loses appeal, receives Order of Freedom\n\nUkraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych's helmet depicts Ukrainian athletes who have died during Russia's invasion. (AP: Steve Moore)\n\nUkrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Milano Cortina Games earlier this week over the use of a helmet depicting Ukrainian athletes killed during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHeraskevych's team appealed the decision but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed the case.\n\nIOC disqualifies Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych is disqualified over his customised helmet featuring the faces of Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nHeraskevych has reacted to the decision by saying: \"CAS has failed us. We will consider our next steps.\"\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a decree awarding Heraskevych the Order of Freedom.\n\nZelenskyy said the helmet was about honour and remembrance.\n\n\"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors. Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media.\n\n\"This is certainly not about the principles of Olympism, which are founded on fairness and the support of peace. I thank our athlete for his clear stance.\"\n\n4. Sturla Laegrid earned another bronze medal \u2014 didn't confess an affair afterwards this time\n\nNorwegian biathlete Sturla Laegreid cemented himself as one of the main storylines of the 2026 Winter Games when he confessed to an affair in his live post-race interview after winning bronze for the 20km individual race.\n\nQuick hits from day four of Winter Olympics A Norwegian's first-ever medal is overshadowed by a stunning admission to reporters as Maxim Naumov pays tribute to his parents in the most beautiful way. Here are the quick hits from the Winter Olympics.\n\nIt was a moment that will overshadow just how well he's doing at these Games.\n\nThree days after that initial bronze, he won another one, this time in the men's sprint biathlon race. However, this one made fewer headlines outside his home country.\n\nHe's also set to be a favourite to medal in the pursuit, mass start and relay later in Milano Cortina.\n\nPerhaps learning from the fallout from that first confession, he didn't reveal anything personal this time post-victory.\n\nAnd in case you missed the ex-girlfriend's response, she said the cheating was \"hard to forgive\".\n\n\"Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world,\" she told Norwegian newspaper VG in a statement.\n\n\"I did not choose to be put in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it.\"\n\n5. Norway\u2019s Klaebo ties all-time Winter Olympics gold record\n\nNorway\u2019s cross-country skiing star Johannes Hosflot Klaebo won his eighth Olympic gold medal (third at these Games), putting him equal with the all-time Winter Games record.\n\nJohannes Hosflot Klaebo has equalled the record for most Winter Olympics golds. (Getty: Lars Baron)\n\nHis latest victory came in the men\u2019s 10km interval start free.\n\nComing from quite a country of winter athletes, he now shares the record with countrymen (who have all retired) Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie in cross-country skiing and Ole Einar Bjoerndalen in the biathlon.\n\nHowever, there's a good chance he'll overtake them, as he still has three races ahead of him.",

        "text": "The first thing to notice is the silence.\n\nIt's quiet as calm cattle are loaded onto a truck on a grazing property in far north Queensland.\n\nIt's in stark contrast to the loud, unpredictable and sometimes dangerous scenes that accompany the transport of roughly 40 million sheep, cattle and goats every year around Australia.\n\nInstead of the usual narrow loading ramp the design has extended the ramp to 1.7 metres wide. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nThe silence is partly created by a massive steel loading ramp that harnesses herd mentality to reduce stress on the animals.\n\nIt's the culmination of five years of work by retired truck driver John Lethbridge with a bucket-list wish to make a difference.\n\n\"Don't ask me why, but I just had this urge,\" Mr Lethbridge, 73 said.\n\n\"And I said, 'I'm going to try and get all the good ideas I've ever seen in my career and plus add a few of my own and try and give to the industry the best ramp that I possibly can [to] try and set the bar.'\"\n\nInnovative cattle ramp\n\nInstead of the usual narrow loading ramp, Mr Lethbridge's ramp is 1.7 metres wide. It allows cattle to walk side by side, as they do naturally in a herd.\n\nThe ramp is one part of the loading facility. The full design includes sheeted gates, counterweights, and a clever configuration like a \"series of little yards\" where cattle can be held and turned around without stress.\n\nCattle can't see dogs and workers, allowing the animals to focus only on the truck and their mates ahead.\n\nThe ramp is designed to be wider allowing cattle to walk on in pairs. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nAfter five decades of moving livestock, Mr Lethbridge believed the equipment used to load animals was often neglected or not designed for modern large trucks carrying up to 200 cattle.\n\n\"The majority of the ramps were only put in to load single decks and body trucks,\" Mr Lethbridge said.\n\n\" The infrastructure hasn't kept pace with the [trucking] industry. \"\n\nWhile he had skills in animal psychology and trucking, he admits he was a very mediocre fabricator and needed help to realise his ideas.\n\n\"Just lucky I've got a mate who came from a rural background that understood cattle and trucks.\n\n\"And with a bit of coercing, I persuaded him to be part of the solution, after \u2026 many beers and a lot of persuasion,\" he laughed.\n\nJohn Lethbridge wanted to design a ramp that helped reduce the stress in cattle during transportation. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nThat mate was Shawn \"Chappy\" Chapman, owner of an engineering company in Charters Towers.\n\n\"I sort of thought, 'Shit, this old fella's sort of lost the plot, you know, like this wide loading ramp,'\" Mr Chapman said.\n\n\"Then I said, 'Righto, I'll build it, but you own it. We'll just tack it together. And when it doesn't work, we can use the steel for something else.\"\n\nTwo mates put their heads together\n\nThe design also protects workers with purpose-built catwalks.\n\n\"It's all up to workplace health and safety standard. The people are completely separate from the cattle, so they can't get injured,\" Mr Chapman said.\n\nJohn Lethbridge's nephew, Russell Lethbridge, is a cattleman and non-executive director of the partly government-funded research and marketing body Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA).\n\nMLA predicted an estimated 9 million cattle would be slaughtered last year, and Russell Lethbridge said reducing the stress of transportation on animals could make farmers money.\n\nRussell Lethbridge believes the reduction of stress in cattle helps boost profits for the industry. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"And that's just to do with infrastructure improvement, animal-handling improvement, preparation of the animal before transport in particular,\" Mr Lethbridge said. \"There can be \u2026 gains anywhere between $20 to $50 a head.\"\n\nReduction in transportation stress\n\nVet scientist Geoffry Fordyce, who specialises in animal welfare in the tropical beef industry, says the stress of transportation can cause infections, diarrhoea and weight loss.\n\nTens of millions of cattle are transported across Australia each year. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"We just evaporate live weight out of animals with stress. It costs a lot of money to stress animals,\" Dr Fordyce said.\n\nHe said most research had focused on the health of animals before they were moved, how they fared inside trucks and life after they arrived at their destination.\n\nGeoffry Fordyce has seen firsthand the negative effects stress can have on cattle's weight and health. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"And almost no research on actually loading and unloading. And the interesting thing is that is actually the stress point,\" he said.\n\n\"Having that ability to walk on in a group rather than single file and to be able to see straight ahead and where they're going it is very powerful.\n\n\"Coupled with not having a steep ramp \u2026 no-one in the pen with you, it is really sensational.\"\n\nThe ramp system costs up to $300,000 and won't be in reach for everyone.\n\nCattle hands on horseback oversee loading using the purpose-built ramp . (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nBut those involved in its creation say the ideas are there for everyone.\n\nJohn Lethbridge said its success lay in its simplicity.\n\n\"You know things can be so simple and yet we don't grasp it,\" he laughed.\n\n\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm AEST on Sunday or stream anytime on ABC iview.",

Have a batch ready and toast in a sandwich press as you need them. (ABC News: Lina Jebeile)\n\nFor suhoor, \"you want something filling and nutritious that's also quick and easy,\" says Lina. And because the meal is early in the morning, \"minimal prep or pre-prepared foods are ideal\".\n\nThese omelette sandwiches tick all the boxes. They have plenty of protein and can keep for up to three days in the fridge, ready to pop in a sandwich press as you need them.\n\nOnce set, you can spoon chia seed pudding into jars and layer with your favourite fruit and nuts. (ABC News: Lina Jebeile)\n\n\"Chia seed pudding is also great,\" says Lina.\n\n\"You can change flavours by substituting rosewater for vanilla essence or maple syrup. And other fruits like mango or figs.\"\n\nThe lentils when blended give this soup a velvety texture and plenty of protein. (ABC News: Lina Jebeile)\n\nWhile it's not what many of us consider \"soup weather\", Lina says soup is a perfect food to start iftar.\n\n\"After a day of fasting it's something that's light on the stomach, easy to digest and hydrates.\"\n\nThis spice lentil soup is nourishing, has a lovely depth and a creamy texture without the need for cream.\n\nIt's also incredibly easy to make from mostly simple pantry ingredients.\n\nSaffron chicken and rice bakes in one pan and is served with toasted nuts and parsley, an easy but delicious iftar option. (ABC News: Lina Jebeile)\n\nHearty meals that are quick to make are another go-to for Lina when it comes to iftar.\n\n\"Busy mid-week days and fasting means you want well-balanced meals that include protein, grains and veg,\" she says.\n\nIn this super easy, one-pot meal, baking white rice with a fragrant infusion of saffron and juicy skin-on chicken thighs creates a rich flavour and beautiful, fluffy rice that's perfectly cooked every time.\n\nThese buttery shortbread biscuits with pistachios are the perfect 'don't bring a thing' plate to contribute to a shared meal. (ABC News: Lina Jebeile)\n\n\"Desserts are a must right throughout Ramadan,\" says Lina.\n\n\"It's a month for gathering and celebrating over dinner, so making desserts is the ideal 'don't bring a thing' plate.\"\n\nThese pistachio and rosewater flavoured biscuits are one of Lina's favourites.\n\nThey're also simple to make and will keep for a couple of weeks.",

        "text": "A public health expert says decades of progress against cervical cancer could be undone in Far North Queensland as school vaccination rates continue to fall.\n\nNew data from the Cairns Public Health Unit shows just 56 per cent of students received the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine last year.\n\nThat is down from 61 per cent the year before and far below the national target of 90 per cent needed to eliminate HPV-related cancers.\n\nThe Cairns figures are preliminary, with a full Queensland School Immunisation Program report not due until the end of the year.\n\nHowever, it adds to statewide data that already shows HPV vaccination rates have steadily declined since 2019, when first-dose uptake peaked at 74.5 per cent in Queensland.\n\nUniversity of Sydney immunisation researcher Julie Leask said the further decline in Cairns school vaccine rates should alarm governments and health authorities.\n\nShe said it came amid declining vaccination rates nationally.\n\n\"We want kids protected before they are exposed, not when it's too late,\" she said.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted viral infection, with about 85 per cent of sexually active people getting it in their lifetime.\n\nSchool HPV vaccine rates have decreased since 2019 in Queensland and the Cairns health region. (Datawrapper)\n\nSome strains can later cause cervical cancer, as well as penile cancer, throat cancers and genital warts.\n\nAustralia has been considered a global leader in HPV prevention since rolling out school-based vaccinations nearly two decades ago, with free vaccinations in schools for year seven students.\n\nHowever, Professor Leask said that progress was at risk if kids increasingly failed to get their shots.\n\nFailing to return consent forms\n\nCairns public health physician Tonia Marquardt said the biggest reason students were missing out was simply that consent forms from parents and guardians were not being returned.\n\nTonia Marquardt says students are failing to return consent forms. (ABC Far North: Rosanne Maloney)\n\nShe said school absences and incorrectly completed forms were also preventing students from being vaccinated.\n\nShe urged families to stay alert as the school year began.\n\n\"We're just asking everyone as the school year starts, keep an eye open for the consent forms and try and get them back in,\" she said.\n\nTrinity Bay State High School executive principal Tony Whybird said low vaccination rates posed a risk beyond individual students.\n\n\"When just over half of the students are being vaccinated, that's not really doing the level of immunity that we'd like to see within our community,\" he said.\n\n\"I strongly encourage all families to get those consent forms back in so that their children can stay healthy in the future.\"\n\nTony Whybird says more vaccine coverage is needed to protect the school community. (ABC Far North: Rosanne Maloney)\n\n\u2018Systems\u2019 rather than vaccine hesitancy\n\nProfessor Leask said the problem, particularly in regional areas like Cairns, was driven by system strain rather than ideology.\n\nShe said schools were managing higher absenteeism, increased student anxiety and growing pressure on staff.\n\nProfessor Leask said public health teams were also working with limited resources and fragmented delivery systems, which could be improved with greater flexibility around electronic or paper consent and schools actively engaging each parent.\n\nSome states administer school vaccine programs internally, while Queensland largely contracts the work out, making the program and vaccination days rigid.\n\nConsent forms are part of the information pack given to families as part of the school immunisation program. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nProfessor Leask said recent measles outbreaks after falling vaccination rates showed what could happen if HPV coverage continued to decline.\n\nMeasles cases in Australia have tripled in recent years, which experts partly attribute to a steep reduction in vaccination rates.\n\n\"If you don't vaccinate, the diseases will come back,\" Professor Leask said.\n\n\"This is a national problem \u2026 a state problem for Queensland, and it's clearly a problem for Cairns.\"",

The likely gains for Australian households include lower prices for European exports such as cars and trucks, wiping away tariffs that add 5 per cent to every vehicle. Australian farmers are also certain to benefit from bigger export opportunities in Europe, although both sides are still wrangling over the scale of the increase in beef and lamb sales. Trade Minister Don Farrell\u2019s talk with the EU looks likely to bear fruit. Lisa Visentin The net result will expand a two-way trade relationship already worth about $110 billion to Australia each year, making this the most important agreement with the European Union in more than a decade. It has always been about much more than cars and cows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a serious risk of failure when Trade Minister Don Farrell arrived in Brussels for two days of talks on Thursday and Friday with his EU counterpart, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d. There was always a chance that the Europeans would not offer enough access for beef and lamb, in which case Farrell would walk away. So the mere fact that the talks continued into a second day, and ended with a positive statement on Friday afternoon (Brussels time), means that a deal is finally within sight. There is now a stronger chance that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Australia to seal an agreement with Prime Minster Anthony Albanese. This potential trip has been aired for at least four weeks, but now there is a solid reason for it to go ahead. Sure, this will only receive modest attention when the Liberal Party is making headlines with its leadership spill and the rise of Angus Taylor as opposition leader. There is far less drama in the mundane work of government. But there are three significant and strategic reasons to welcome the news from Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is likely to visit Australia to seal a landmark trade deal. Omar Havana/AP The first is that Australia and Europe are getting closer at a time when both have to contend with the sudden upheavals from Donald Trump on trade and security. The US president is turning America into an unreliable ally. The rational response for Australia is to tighten links with other allies. The second is that Australian leaders have been saying for years that we need to rely less on China for our exports. Of course, sales to Europe cannot match the sheer volume of trade with China in coal, gas and iron ore. But it is wise to diversify. The third is that the trade deal will be accompanied by a defence partnership. This will not be an alliance like NATO or ANZUS, but an agreement to work together on exercises and procurement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt might help Australian companies sell equipment to Europe, and it could help both sides work together on \u201chybrid warfare\u201d threats such as drone strikes and cyberattacks. Put more bluntly, it will be about dealing with Russia and China. There are likely to be practical and fairly swift benefits as well. One is that cars from Europe become cheaper for households. Right now, a European car is 5 per cent more expensive because of the Australian tariff regime. This puts companies such as Volkswagen, Skoda, Fiat and others \u2013 not just the luxury brands \u2013 at a disadvantage to rivals from China, Japan, Thailand and the US. (All these countries already have trade deals with Australia.) This is good for competition. Australian households are on track to enjoy lower prices for European exports, including luxury cars. Bloomberg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother is that other capital goods also fall in price. While most products get into Australia without a barrier, there is still a 5 per cent tariff on many products from Europe. A cafe might pay more for a coffee machine, for instance. A transport company might pay more for a European truck. There will also be a benefit for farmers who want to export more beef and lamb but have been blocked by EU quotas. In January, the Europeans appeared to be willing to allow 24,000 tonnes of beef and 20,000 tonnes of lamb from Australia each year. This was so low that there did not seem much point in doing a deal. Farrell has pushed for more. Right now, Australia is barred from shipping more than 3389 tonnes of beef to the EU each year, according to Meat and Livestock Australia. It wants an increase to 50,000 tonnes, arguing this is in line with EU agreements with Canada and Brazil. Farm groups in Europe are lobbying to keep the number low. Farrell sounded positive on Friday, which suggests he has made some headway. The \u201cstretch\u201d goal for the Australian side would be anything above 40,000 tonnes. There are other gains to sweeten a final deal. Europe wants access to Australian critical minerals, and there is no reason to turn it away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is likely to be a limited agreement to make it easier for skilled workers to move between Australian and European employers, but this will not be open slather. (Anything more ambitious on visa rules would need approval from national parliaments in Europe.) Jason Collins, who heads the European Australian Business Council, says finalising a deal would be a \u201csmart move\u201d to increase access to 450 million consumers across the EU. Just how much Australian beef can go into European markets has been a sticking point in the trade talks. Joanne O\u2019Keefe The decision to start these trade talks dates back to 2015. Progress was so slow that Farrell walked away two years ago because the Europeans were not offering enough access on beef and lamb. He was right to insist on a better deal. On Friday in Brussels, the trade minister issued a brief statement: \u201cI am confident that both Australia and the European Union will reach agreement that benefits both of our economies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did not say that they \u201ccould\u201d reach a deal \u2013 he said they \u201cwill\u201d. After more than a decade, an agreement is within sight. This will not get as much attention as a Liberal leadership spill, but it represents a quiet economic win for Labor. The gains for households are real. And, in the age of Trump, the strategic benefits are not to be ignored.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAn Aboriginal land council is leading a push for a small but historically significant island in Sydney Harbour to be returned to traditional custodians after the site was listed for sale as part of a sweeping $3 billion sell-off of surplus defence land. Spectacle Island is at the centre of a growing debate about whether prominent public assets with deep historical value should be sold to private interests after the two-hectare former naval outpost was included in a list of 67 defence properties set to be divested by the federal government to fund modern defence priorities. Naval Historical Society president David Michael, pictured with Spectacle Island in the distance, believes the site\u2019s heritage should be maintained. Sitthixay Ditthavong Vacant since 2023, Spectacle Island has played a quiet but consequential role in Australia\u2019s defence history \u2013 first as a gunpowder store established in 1865, later as a naval munitions depot, and more recently as a storage base for the Royal Australian Navy\u2019s heritage collection. The island contains about 40 heritage buildings, including 19th-century powder magazines and laboratories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts listing has ignited discussion about whether surplus defence sites should be sold off or repurposed for public uses such as open space, cultural facilities or social and affordable housing. While the NSW Government has confirmed it is considering housing options for another defence site, Victoria Barracks in Paddington, Planning Minister Paul Scully was less specific about Spectacle Island, saying NSW would \u201cengage constructively\u201d with the federal government as opportunities arose. Spectacle Island on the Parramatta River section of Sydney Harbour, with Cockatoo Island in the background. Getty Images The Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council is preparing a formal request to the federal government for Aboriginal ownership. Metro LALC chief executive Nathan Moran said the proposed sale was an opportunity to address historic land dispossession. \u201cMore than 99 per cent of our backyard has been taken from us and rather than being sold off to private interests for the highest price, this is a rare opportunity for the federal government to help correct past injustices while creating new economic and cultural pathways for our people,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoran said Spectacle Island, together with nearby Goat Island \u2013 which remains subject to final transfer negotiations with the NSW government \u2013 could support Indigenous-led tourism, education programs and cultural events. Spectacle Island is one of 67 defence sites set to be fully or partially divested by the federal government. Fairfax Media \u201cOver 70 per cent of visitors to Sydney seek an Aboriginal cultural tourism experience, and right now there\u2019s nowhere to deliver it at scale within the harbour,\u201d he said. The listing has also sparked speculation that the island could be sold to private buyers and repurposed for uses such as boutique accommodation, hospitality or events. That would align with recent changes to the management of other islands within Sydney Harbour, including the NSW government awarding a tender for a hospitality venue to operate on Fort Denison and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust expanding public access and commercial activity on Cockatoo Island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProperty Council of Australia policy executive Matthew Kandelaars said hospitality and premium tourism were the most plausible commercial options for Spectacle Island, given constraints including water-only access and strict heritage controls. Resort Brokers director Tim Crooks said the island could attract interest from high-net-worth individuals, investors or hospitality groups, with its value potentially reaching tens of millions of dollars depending on permitted uses. \u201cThe sale of an island in Sydney Harbour is an incredibly rare proposition and it will generate a lot of interest, particularly among buyers looking at adaptive reuse options, such as luxury accommodation, events or destination hospitality,\u201d Crooks said. Defence audit documents describe many of the island\u2019s structures as \u201csignificantly degraded\u201d due to water ingress, lead paint and decades of limited maintenance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles, pictured at Victoria Barracks in Paddington, said Spectacle Island is costing millions of dollars to maintain. Peter Rae The buildings are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage Register under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, meaning any buyer would face strict conservation and environmental remediation requirements. Related Article NSW State Parliament \u2018Not surplus land or disposable asset\u2019: Labor MP says Victoria Barracks should be saved UNSW City Futures Research Centre professor Chris Pettit said that while housing had been discussed as an option for other defence sites, Spectacle Island was unlikely to play a meaningful role in easing the housing crisis due to its small size and limited transport access. He said the island had significant international tourism appeal and suggested it would be better managed by a public authority or Aboriginal organisation rather than a private owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe only other option is a multimillionaire buying it as a trophy asset for prestige, but that would not be an equitable use of what has long been a publicly owned site,\u201d he said. Heritage advocates have warned that private ownership could jeopardise the preservation of the island\u2019s historic buildings and military artefacts, including gun turrets and ship bells. Spectacle Island has been included in a divestment program of defence assets. Australian Defence Force David Michael, president of the Naval Historical Society, said preserving the island\u2019s buildings would require significant investment. \u201cIt is Australia\u2019s oldest naval explosives manufacturing and storage site,\u201d he said. Drummoyne state Liberal MP Stephanie Di Pasqua said the proposed sale had \u201ccome as a shock\u201d to many in the community and called for the site to remain in public hands.

Credit: AP\n\nThose underneath it thought something had gone horribly wrong - so wrong, potentially, that the result might have been in question had it come into his peripheral vision.\n\nFellow Australian snowboarder Valentino Guseli thought someone from above was trying to send Scotty a sign.\n\n\u201cYou know what was crazy? Did you see the wire that broke? I thought that that was some kind of omen from the shred gods,\u201d Guseli said.\n\n\u201cHe was riding that pipe, he was tearing it apart - like, that was from the shred gods saying, \u2018We\u2019re with you Scotty\u2019 while he was in the pipe. It was the craziest thing that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d\n\nDid James notice the cable? And if he did notice the cable, would that have been grounds for a protest?\n\nGuseli reckoned so.\n\n\u201cIf he noticed it, that would be enough to mess you up if you\u2019re in a trick,\u201d Guseli said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that trick, he probably didn\u2019t notice it - but if he did, you\u2019d want a re-run, kind of thing.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, James only found out about it when it was raised with him afterwards by media.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about the cable,\u201d he said. \u201cI should blame it on the cable.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, the result was a case of someone being better than him on the night, and James was not hiding from that.\n\nAs Guseli put it: \u201cI guess they [the shred gods] weren\u2019t with him.\u201d\n\nValentino Guseli in the men\u2019s halfpipe final. Credit: Getty Images\n\nNor were they with him. Guseli, 20, pulled off a score of 88.00 in his third and final run to finish in fifth - his best effort at this level, continuing his progression, but not yet enough to get on on the dais.\n\n\u201cOn the first two runs I sucked, but I landed my last one, and I got one place better than I did at the last Olympics - so we\u2019re going up, which is cool,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading\n\nThe pressure of the occasion and the quality of the field made it tricky for him to compete, and to bring out his best self.\n\nIf he had more time between the Olympics and the ACL injury he sustained in December 2024, could he have rivalled James and the Japanese for a medal?\n\n\u201cSure, but that wasn\u2019t the reality, and I did what I could with my reality,\u201d Guseli said.\n\n\u201cI think if I rode better today I would be in a better place - and I definitely think I could have ridden better, but dealing with the pressure of the Olympics, and especially finals, it\u2019s crazy.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I watched the girls and was surprised with how many crashes there were \u2013 stuff that I\u2019ve seen these girls do really consistently and then on that night they couldn\u2019t really get it. And then, today, I understood why.\n\n\u201cThat kind of finals pressure in the Olympics is massive, and I think everyone felt it a little bit. I think Yuto managed to feel it the least and put down the best run, which is great for him, and unfortunately for Scotty, didn\u2019t get the W [win] that everyone was expecting and hoping for. But it might keep him in the sport a bit longer.\u201d\n\nGuseli couldn\u2019t say if the nerves he felt in Livigno were different to the nerves he felt as a 16-year-old at Beijing in 2022. What he did know was that jagging a medal was within his current capabilities had he executed. And he didn\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cI knew that today, I definitely was going for gold a lot more than four years ago. I didn\u2019t have much experience back then ... going into it I believed that if I did my best snowboarding, that I could have won,\u201d Guseli said.\n\n\u201cI still believe if I did my best snowboarding, I could have won. But I just didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the nature of the game. Sucks to suck, I guess. But it doesn\u2019t really - that\u2019s life.\u201d",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\"Australia changes her currency. Pounds and shillings are out, and dollars and cents are in.\"\n\nIt's the 14th of February, 1966 - and Australians have woken up to a new way of counting money.\n\n\"They're 40c a dozen what do I do? Oh gran, you can pay in shillings and pence, or dollars and cents - one kind of money is as good as the other.\"\n\nThe changeover - one of the largest financial transitions in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nBut it took a massive effort to get there - Including the help of a certain jingle.\n\n\"In come the dollars, in come the cents to replace the pound, shillings and pence.\"\n\n\"The government embarked on a national public education campaign. They rolled out television ads, radio. There was education in schools, special education for banks and shops, and it was really successful.\"\n\nEmily Martin is the CEO of the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra \u2013 where the coins are made.\n\nShe says it wasn\u2019t just a move that aligned us with much of the world, but also helped simplify trade and everyday transactions.\n\n\"There was a lot of calculations that people had to make to understand how many shillings were in a pound and pence in a shilling, and it was a very complex system.\"\n\nShe also says it\u2019s an opportunity to help tell the nation\u2019s story through metal.\n\nAnd six decades on, the Royal Australian Mint continues to preserve that history.\n\n\"We educate visitors, international tourists, school groups, this wonderful place that people can come and learn about our currency and the stories that we tell through our coins.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also home to the National Coin Collection \u2013 which contains more than 15-thousand items \u2013 from early colonial currency and rare proof coins, to the very designs that marked Decimal Day.\n\nThose were the brainchild of artist and metalworker Stuart Devlin \u2013 who went on to become Queen Elizabeth the Second\u2019s jeweller.\n\nMr Devlin had won a competition in 1964 \u2013 beating five other competitors \u2013 to develop the artworks for the new coins\u2026. Which introduced a distinctly Australian look.\n\nThe now-defunct one and two cent pieces featured a feathertail glider and frill-necked lizard.\n\nEven the 12-sided 50 cent coin made a statement. Originally it was round, and made from silver in 1966 \u2013 before changing shape, to prevent confusion with the 20 cent piece.\n\nIt carries Australia\u2019s coat of arms.\n\nThe Royal Australian Mint's Director Museum and Public Engagement Stuart Baines says the National Coin Collection also holds coins from over 100 countries.\n\n\"It's not just Australian coins and it's not just post decimal, the coins we have made. One of our prized pieces is the holey dollar, which was made from the Spanish. These coins were our first official currency and they really were a symbol that we wanted to grow as a nation. We didn't have a mint in this country at the time, so we of course employed a convict who had served his time in Australia for forgery and he actually was the one who struck our first coins. So there's lots of little stories that these coins can tell us about who we are and where we've come from and how we grow and change as a nation.\"\n\nThat includes stories about all segments of Australian society.\n\nWhich Mr Baines says the Mint has been committed to telling through special release coins in the decades since decimal currency was introduced.\n\n\"We do have a lot of different coins that celebrate all aspects of our life. We create coins around Paralympics and that celebrate different migrating groups to Australia and different cultures within Australia.\"\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a sharp decline in the use of cash and coins over the years, Emily Martin says commemorative and collectible series are popular as ever.\n\nAnd says the future of coins remains bright.\n\n\"There has been a decline in the use of circulating coins but we have seen that desire for our collectible coins really grow and the average new generations of collectors so it is a way that people like to recognise special events and tell our history through our coins. We will continue to make coins as long as there is demand.\"",

Source: AAP / Sergio Bisi/IPA Sport\n\nBaff said she felt she earned the win through her hard work since her Beijing disappointment, when she was left in tears after her campaign ended in the opening race.\n\n\"It's very amazing \u2014 I would like to say that I can't believe it but I kind of can,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like I deserve it and I put in a lot of hard work so I knew I could do it but to actually have the medal around my neck is very, very cool.\n\n\"It's definitely something that I've been working towards for a very long time and my team has been helping me achieve that every step of the way.\"\n\nAustralia's second snowboard cross medal \u2014 ever\n\nIt was Australia's second ever snowboard cross medal. Jarryd Hughes took silver in the men's race in Pyeongchang in 2018, while Torah Bright is the only other woman to medal in snowboarding, winning two in the halfpipe.\n\nBaff's father Peter coached both Bright and his daughter as a junior.\n\nBaff had arrived in strong form, sitting in the world No. 2 ranking, but she had a slow start to the day and finished only 17th in the seedings.\n\nThat meant she raced against new mum Adamczykova, the top seed, all the way through.\n\nBaff was the second Australian ever to win a medal in the snowboard cross. Source: AAP / Zabulon Laurent/ABACA/PA\n\n\"I was definitely disappointed as I knew I was super fast on this track and it was annoying because I wanted to win the time trial but to win the gold medal is even better so I'm super happy,\" said Baff.\n\n\"When I saw I had Eva in a first round it's definitely a tough first heat ... but I knew that it could also wake me up and work in my favour.\n\n\"It meant that we were racing from the first round and we were able to lock into that mindset really early on.\n\nBaff showed her class to win her first race and move through to the quarter-finals, where she finished second in a four-race field in a heart-stopping photo finish.\n\nShe charged through her semi-final, making a move midway through the final with a superb overtake to nab the gold by 0.04 seconds.\n\nAussie star misses out on gold\n\nHours later, Australian snowboard great Scotty James fell short in his quest to complete his Olympic medal collection.\n\nCompeting at his fifth Olympics, James became Australia's most decorated winter athlete with three medals, winning another silver after Beijing as well as the bronze he won eight years ago in Pyeongchang.\n\nHe was also part of the country's most successful single day, his second place coming shortly after Baff's gold.\n\nBut it was mostly disappointment with James shedding tears and being comforted by Australia's canoe great Jessica Fox when she presented his medal.\n\nLeading into the Olympics he had openly declared gold was his \"north star\".\n\n\"It's a bit numb, like I don't really know how to feel,\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"The next 24 hours I'll probably have a bit of a cry, but I'll be happy as well because representing the country and winning a medal is unbelievable, and I'm really proud of that.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

I'm born here in Australia. I've never made dumplings before. So, I currently study Chinese at school and my Chinese teacher actually invited me to this event. So, when I heard, I was really excited and I decided to join.\"\n\nHand-rolling dumplings is an age-old skill in Asia, dating back thousands of years to the Han dynasty in China.\n\nThe pockets of pastry symbolising wealth traditionally made with savoury meat or vegetable fillings.\n\nCustomer Paul Hordijenko explains.\n\n\"Normally we start off with the dumpling skin. Then we roll it out and then get some of the filling like this in here. And then make sure that it is squeezed nice and tight, like a seal.\"\n\nHowever, Hoppy Dumpling restaurant owner Gary Zhao, who grew up in China\u2019s Guangdong Province, says the workshop goes way beyond traditional fillings.\n\n\"We have five options. The first one is the cheese, chicken corn and the second one is the celery pork. Third one is the Korean style kimchi spicy pork. And the fourth one is the French style chicken liver. And the last one is the curried beef, curry Wagyu beef.\"\n\nWhile new flavours are well received many still prefer traditional styles \u2013 with pork and celery crowned most popular.\n\nGARY: \"I'm a really big pork fan, so that's definitely my favourite flavour.\"\n\nHENRY: \"The pork dumpling, it\u2019s been one of my favourites for a long time.\"\n\nThe choice of filling may be personal taste, there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees on, says customer Paul Hordijenko.\n\n\"The one that you buy in a supermarket, it's just quick and convenient, pretty standard taste. But I think the ones that you make by hand, they taste a lot fresher.\"\n\nMr Zhao says this was the first make-your-own dumpling event but definitely won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\"This shocked me, that many people from different culture, they all came and they all interesting about this. Many customers, they learn very fast and then really enjoy making these dumplings.\"\n\nRolling these tasty parcels is also a chance to learn about the history of Lunar New Year celebrations, says Paul Hordijenko.\n\n\"I actually heard it for the first time today that they'll put normally a coin inside the filling for good luck for Chinese New Year, for prosperity.\"\n\nAnd it seems to be working.\n\nOwner Gary Zhao says sales have soared since his first DIY dumpling event.\n\n\"The dumpling making event is good for the business. Before, we sold 1,000 dumplings a day. After this event, it reaches around 2,500 a day.\"\n\nFor many customers, sharing the dumplings is also a way to bring the family closer.\n\nLINISHA: \"This activity is really nice for family bonding when you're all making together traditional dumplings.\"\n\nPAUL: \"We're all busy with work and it's activity that you can do together and enjoy time as a family. So I think it's great.\"\n\nOwner Gary Zhao can only agree.\n\n\"Eating and making dumplings in China always meaning family and friends gathering together.\"",

        "text": "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has won a decisive two-thirds majority in general elections, \u200ca result expected to bring stability after months of tumult following the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising.\n\nLatest counts in an election seen \u200cas the South Asian nation's first truly competitive in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said on Friday.\n\nThe \u200copposition Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the parliament.\n\nThe BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon after winning a majority in the overnight vote count and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.\n\n\"Despite winning ... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nThe National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.\n\nA clear outcome had been seen as key for stability in the nation of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina unrest disrupted everyday life and industries such as garments, in the export of which Bangladesh is No.2 globally.\n\n\"A strong majority gives BNP the parliamentary strength to pass reforms efficiently and avoid legislative paralysis. That alone can create short-term political stability,\" Selim Raihan, an economics professor at the University of Dhaka, told Reuters news agency.\n\nBNP leader Tarique Rahman is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister. The son of the party's founder, former president Ziaur Rahman, returned in December to the capital, Dhaka, from 18 years abroad.\n\nIn its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers.\n\n\"If the factories run regularly and we get our wages on time, that\u2019s what matters to us. I just want the BNP government to bring back stability so more orders come to Bangladesh and we can survive,\" Josna Begum, 28, a garment worker and mother of two, told Reuters after the results.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the US ambassador to Bangladesh, Brent T. Christensen, were among the first to congratulate Rahman on his party's victory.\n\nBNP supporters celebrate\n\nThe Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami conceded defeat late on Thursday night once trends became clear, but said in a statement on Friday that it was \"not satisfied\" with the process and asked its followers to stay patient.\n\nNow in exile in New Delhi, Hasina long dominated Bangladesh politics along with Rahman's mother, Khaleda Zia, while his father was a leading independence figure who ruled from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.\n\nThe BNP win with more than 200 seats is one of its biggest, surpassing its 2001 victory with 193, although Hasina's Awami League, which ruled for 15 years and was barred from contesting this time, secured a bigger tally of 230 in 2008.\n\nBut elections of other years were boycotted by one of the main parties or were contentious.\n\nOvernight, throngs of supporters cheered and shouted slogans at the BNP headquarters in Dhaka as the scale of the party's landslide became clear.\n\nTurnout exceeded the 42 per cent of the last election in 2024, with nearly 60 per cent of registered voters participating in the election on Thursday, according to local media.\n\nMore than 2,000 candidates, many independents among them, were on the ballot, which featured a record number of at least 50 parties. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.\n\nBroadcaster Jamuna TV said more than 2 million voters chose \"Yes\", while more than 850,000 said \"No\" in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, but there was no official word on the outcome.\n\nThe changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women's representation while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods, and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.\n\nPeaceful polls\n\nParty workers spent the whole night in front of the BNP offices.\n\n\"We will join the nation-building effort led by Tarique Rahman,\" Md Fazlur Rahman, 45, told Agence France-Presse.\n\n\"Over the last 17 years, we have suffered a lot.\"\n\nHeavy deployments of security forces are posted countrywide, and UN experts warned ahead of the voting of \"growing intolerance, threats and attacks\", and a \"tsunami of disinformation\".\n\nPolitical clashes killed five people and injured more than 600 during campaigning, police records show.\n\nBut polling day was largely peaceful, according to the Election Commission, which reported only \"a few minor disruptions\".\n\n'Ended the nightmare'\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, has urged all to stay calm.\n\n\"We may have differences of opinion, but we must remain united in the greater national interest,\" he said.\n\nThe 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led Bangladesh since Hasina's rule ended with her ouster in August 2024.\n\nHis administration barred her Awami League party from contesting the polls.\n\nYunus said the election had \"ended the nightmare and begun a new dream\".\n\nHasina, 78, sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement decrying an \"illegal and unconstitutional election\".\n\nYunus has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a \"completely broken\" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.\n\nVoters also took part in a referendum on the proposals for prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.\n\nTelevision projections suggested 65 percent of votes had endorsed the charter.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Bigger government isn't the solution to Australia's problems, Australians are the solutions to Australia's problems and that means putting faith back in you.\"\n\nSenator Jane Hume, who will serve as deputy leader, says Australians can expect to see a more responsive Liberal party that's focused on them.\n\n\"Under Angus Taylor, Australians will see a Liberal party that focuses on them. A party that listens and responds to the issues that matter and I know this because I know Angus. He is smart, he is dedicated and he'll be in your corner every single day and he will never give up.\"\n\nSussan Ley has announced she will leave politics which means there will be a by-election in her New South Wales seat of Farrer.\n\nOne Nation MP Barnaby Joyce says the party will contest the seat.\n\n---\n\nStolen Generations survivors and their advocates have called for trauma\u2011informed and affordable aged care to help ageing survivors.\n\nToday, marks 18 years since the National Apology to the Stolen Generations delivered by then prime minister Kevin Rudd.\n\nReconciliation Australia and Stolen Generations advocacy body, The Healing Foundation, say the anniversary is a pointed reminder of the need for action on the delivery of support for Stolen Generations survivors; including through measures like equitable redress, access to records, and sustained funding for survivor-led organisations.\n\nStolen Generations survivor Wilfred Thomas Prince was forcibly removed from his family at the at the age of two.\n\nHe has told NITV says there is still more healing that needs to take place.\n\n\"During that public apology (by Kevin Rudd)... it has somehow made me somewhat healed inside. It hasn't completely healed me. But it is a starting point. By telling the stories, it will help future generations with the stories, and the continuation - that should never be lost.\"\n\n---\n\nWiradjuri woman BJ Newton says the anniversary of the National Apology is also an opportunity to reflect that child removal remains an issue today.\n\nThe latest Closing the Gap data shows that there has been no progress on the target to reduce the rate of over-representation of First Nations children in out-of-home care by 45 per cent by 2031.\n\nIn fact, the rate has been rising.\n\nAssociate professor Newton has told NITV Radio, the lack of progress has been disappointing; and more resources need to go into finding solutions.\n\n\"So if we can think about the importance of keeping families together (and) not thinking about removal as the solution to families that are struggling and alternative ways to ensure that families can stay together where everybody is safe and thrives.\"\n\n---\n\nAn investigation will be undertaken in New South Wales into police actions during this week's violent protest against the visit of Israel's President, Isaac Herzog.\n\nThe Law Enforcement Conduct Commission has released a statement saying it decided it was in the public interest to investigate the violent clashes between police and demonstrators at Town Hall after receiving a significant number of complaints.\n\nThe police watchdog says it will review video and phone footage and conduct public hearings before presenting a public report to the New South Wales parliament.\n\nThe Palestine Action Group says it welcomes the investigation into what it calls police brutality and calls for the resignations of Premier Chris Minns, Police Minister Yasmin Catley and Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon.\n\nPresident Herzog concluded his visit to Australia with several events in Melbourne.\n\nCouncillor Simone Zmood is the mayor of Glen Eira City Council which is a local government area in Melbourne that's home to many Jewish people.\n\nShe's told SBS Hebrew President Herzog's visit was welcome.\n\n\"Having a recognised leader in the Jewish world come and share empathy and sympathy and solidarity with community members here is really important so that people feel their pain and their concerns living in Australia at this time, with all the rising antisemitism, that it's actually heard globally and in Australia.\"\n\n---\n\nTo sport and in football,\n\nThe Socceroos have announced their World Cup base in the United States, will be in Oakland, California.\n\nCoach Tony Popovic says the first class facility will provide a comfortable and welcoming location to get the best out of his team.\n\nAustralia has been drawn in Group D and is set to take on the winner of the UEFA Play-off path C in Vancouver in June, before facing World Cup co-hosts the United States in Seattle.\n\nThe team's final group-stage game will be against Paraguay in Santa Clara.",

        "text": "With Lunar New Year just days away, the countdown is on to gallop into the Year of the Fire Horse \u2014 seen as one of the most high-voltage combinations in the Chinese zodiac cycle.\n\nThe fire horse last appeared in 1966, and combines two extremely dynamic symbols in the calendar.\n\nThere are 12 animals in the zodiac, and five elements \u2014 wood, fire, earth, metal and water \u2014 meaning each animal-element pairing appears just once every 60 years.\n\n\"The fire is kind of a symbol for energy, rushfulness, and the symbol for horse will be meaning energy, vitality, speed and passion,\" Fan Shengyu, an associate professor at the Australian National University School of Culture, History and Language, said.\n\n\"It's one very particular year in that 60 year cycle. It's very special,\" he told SBS News.\n\nPan Wang, associate professor of Chinese and Asian Studies at the University of New South Wales, said fire and horse represent very similar qualities.\n\n\"If you put these together, it's like a double fire,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\"That will certainly symbolise vitality, passion, this full energy and high speed, courage.\"\n\nWhat to expect from the Year of the Fire Horse\n\nEach Chinese zodiac animal is associated with both positive and negative traits.\n\nFor the horse, Wang said, the flip side includes high tempers, restlessness and impulsivity, and being difficult to harness or rein in.\n\nShe said this year, people are encouraged not to hesitate when making decisions, and to embrace the traits of the horse.\n\n\"Basically, this is a year that rewards fearless courage, dedication and punishes indecision, hesitation or impassiveness,\" she said.\n\n\"Just ride the horse and ride the momentum, and do not hesitate too much and complete the journey.\"\n\nHow will people around the world be celebrating?\n\nThis year, Lunar New Year falls on 17 February. Many celebrations will take place the night before, with festivities continuing for around two weeks \u2014 though the length of the holiday varies in different countries.\n\nMillions of people celebrate Lunar New Year worldwide. While it has deep roots in Chinese culture, it's observed in different and unique ways across many East and Southeast Asian communities, and may be known as Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), Seollal (Korean Lunar New Year) and T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n (Vietnamese New Year).\n\nIt's a time for families to come together and share symbolic foods, embrace traditions, exchange wishes for good fortune and celebrate spring and a new beginning.\n\nSome other common traditions include letting off fireworks and putting up decorations and symbols of the animal of the year.\n\nIn many cultures, it's considered good luck to wear red to mark the occasion, and to gift red envelopes containing money.\n\nThis year, however, some may opt to wear calmer shades like white or blue to balance the intensity of the fire horse.\n\n\"When you're having too much yang, you want some yin to balance that,\" Pang said.\n\n\"You need some water as well when there are too much fire.\"\n\nFire horse lore and idioms\n\nThe fire horse holds strong meanings in many Asian cultures.\n\nIn Japan, there was a dip in the birth rate in 1966. The dip was said to be associated with a superstition that women born in the year of the fire horse would have fiery and uncontrollable temperaments that would not be suitable for marriage.\n\n\"I don't believe the majority of the younger generation will uphold that belief,\" Pang said.\n\n\"All of these are evolving and changing.\"\n\nA Year of the Horse toy with its smile accidentally stitched on upside down became a viral sensation in China this year. Source: Getty / China News Service\n\nThere are numerous idioms associated with both fire and the horse in Chinese culture, she noted, compared to many of the other zodiac animals.\n\nSome of these include:\n\nL\u00f3ng m\u01ce j\u012bng sh\u00e9n: Literally \"dragon-horse spirit\", this refers to vigorous energy and vitality.\n\nSh\u00ed w\u00e0n hu\u01d2 j\u00ed: Translated, this means \"one hundred thousand fires urgent\". Idiomatically, it's said to indicate something is extremely urgent.\n\nM\u01ce d\u00e0o ch\u00e9ng g\u014dng: Success upon the arrival of the horse.\n\nM\u01cesh\u01d2u sh\u00eczh\u0101n: Follow the horse's head.\n\nY\u012b m\u01ce d\u0101ng xi\u0101n: One horse takes the lead.\n\nM\u01ceb\u00f9t\u00edngt\u00ed: The horse does not stop its hooves.\n\nShu\u01d0hu\u01d2 b\u00f9r\u00f3ng: Water and fire cannot coexist.\n\nJin Han, director of the Australia-China Institute for Arts and Culture at Western Sydney University, said horses were considered \"critical in winning battles\" in ancient Chinese history.\n\n\"That is also why horses are so important to success, and also we have so many idioms in Chinese about horses,\" she told SBS Chinese.\n\nShe noted the popularity of the saying \"m\u01ce d\u00e0o ch\u00e9ng g\u014dng\".\n\n\"Basically it means, upon the arrival of a horse, the success is secured,\" she said.\n\n\"So the year of the horse will be a year of success.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Be grateful that you had it at all. So today I want to express gratitude to the Liberal Party that I have belonged to and loved for more than half of my adult life, to the party room that elected me as their leader nine months ago, and to the Parliament of Australia that has been the most extraordinary workplace for 25 years.\"\n\n---\n\nThe group representing 80 Aboriginal community-controlled representative organisations says local networks are key to Closing the Gap.\n\nOf the 19 Closing the Gap targets, four are on track to be completed, with a further six improving.\n\nIn his annual Closing the Gap speech to parliament, Anthony Albanese says the federal government is determined to achieve the targets.\n\nHe has announced extra funding for services like the 24-hour Indigenous crisis support hotline 13YARN.\n\nThe deputy co-covenor of Coalition of Peaks, Scott Wilson, says the support is welcome and the effort to improve outcomes must continue.\n\n\"We welcome the further investments that were announced that by the prime minister in the House of Reps in employment, food security and access to mental health services. They are not abstract policy areas. They go directly to whether our people can live with dignity, stability and hope.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales and the ACT is calling for more action on Indigenous deaths in custody.\n\nNadine Miles, from the Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales and the ACT, says data shows more Indigenous deaths in custody have been recorded this year, on top of last year's record-high number.\n\nAboriginal people now make up over a third of adults in New South Wales prisons.\n\nMs Miles says the high incarceration rate and tough-on-crime policies are diverting the focus from strategies like prevention and investing in frontline and local Aboriginal services.\n\n---\n\nThe powerful reach of radio is being celebrated on World Radio Day.\n\nOne broadcaster who loves the medium is Sagar Mehrotra who has spent the past 22 years of his career at Indian Link Radio.\n\nHe told SBS Hindi, radio is even more powerful today because of the use of the internet which enables content to reach even more people through digital platforms.\n\n\"Radio is a product that can reach to millions and gazillions. TV, you can't have it in your car, TV, you can't have it in while in the air. But radio is something that if you have the slightest internet connection these days, you have the reach. You have that facility not just to listen but to interact, TV doesn't give you that.\"\n\n---\n\nTo sport and in hockey, Australia's Kookaburras have secured their second win of the FIH Pro League Hobart block against Germany, defeating the visitors 3\u20130 in Tasmania.\n\nIt was a disciplined start from Australia, who absorbed early German pressure before building momentum through strong defensive structure and controlled possession.\n\nWith back-to-back wins on home soil, the Kookaburras now turn their attention to a Friday night clash against Pakistan.",

Ballarat Community Health staff say they clocked up more than 8000 kilometres and at least 110 hours driving clients back and forth between the regional city and detox facilities in Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo late last year. Ballarat Community Health clinical lead Mel Lishman (right) and peer support worker Dean Seabrook work in drug and alcohol services in the region. Jason South The trips \u2013 the equivalent of almost three weeks\u2019 worth of patient outreach and care \u2013 were recorded in the three months leading up to Christmas. The driving was mostly done by specialist nurses trained to provide in-home or community-based care for Victorians withdrawing from alcohol and other drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBallarat Community Health clinic lead for alcohol and other drugs Mel Lishman said staff spent a lot of time driving clients to services in Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo because the region did not have a dedicated detox facility for adults.

Detox refers to the short-term medical process of clearing substances from the body and safely managing withdrawal symptoms.

Non-residential withdrawal is done at home or via an outpatient service for more mild dependency. Ballarat peer support worker Dean Seabrook said alcohol continued to be the most commonly used drug in the region, but cannabis was common, too. There had also been an increase in the usage of GHB, also known as liquid ecstasy. \u201cIt\u2019s reported by clients that methamphetamine purity is very low at the moment. It\u2019s getting cut with things, so clients aren\u2019t getting that buzz.

Patients are connected to a nurse and local GP who prescribe the necessary medications. Thomson said this was an area the government could also invest in.

The likely gains for Australian households include lower prices for European exports such as cars and trucks, wiping away tariffs that add 5 per cent to every vehicle. Australian farmers are also certain to benefit from bigger export opportunities in Europe, although both sides are still wrangling over the scale of the increase in beef and lamb sales. Trade Minister Don Farrell\u2019s talk with the EU looks likely to bear fruit. Lisa Visentin The net result will expand a two-way trade relationship already worth about $110 billion to Australia each year, making this the most important agreement with the European Union in more than a decade. It has always been about much more than cars and cows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a serious risk of failure when Trade Minister Don Farrell arrived in Brussels for two days of talks on Thursday and Friday with his EU counterpart, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d. There was always a chance that the Europeans would not offer enough access for beef and lamb, in which case Farrell would walk away. So the mere fact that the talks continued into a second day, and ended with a positive statement on Friday afternoon (Brussels time), means that a deal is finally within sight. There is now a stronger chance that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Australia to seal an agreement with Prime Minster Anthony Albanese. This potential trip has been aired for at least four weeks, but now there is a solid reason for it to go ahead. Sure, this will only receive modest attention when the Liberal Party is making headlines with its leadership spill and the rise of Angus Taylor as opposition leader. There is far less drama in the mundane work of government. But there are three significant and strategic reasons to welcome the news from Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is likely to visit Australia to seal a landmark trade deal. Omar Havana/AP The first is that Australia and Europe are getting closer at a time when both have to contend with the sudden upheavals from Donald Trump on trade and security. The US president is turning America into an unreliable ally. The rational response for Australia is to tighten links with other allies. The second is that Australian leaders have been saying for years that we need to rely less on China for our exports. Of course, sales to Europe cannot match the sheer volume of trade with China in coal, gas and iron ore. But it is wise to diversify. The third is that the trade deal will be accompanied by a defence partnership. This will not be an alliance like NATO or ANZUS, but an agreement to work together on exercises and procurement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt might help Australian companies sell equipment to Europe, and it could help both sides work together on \u201chybrid warfare\u201d threats such as drone strikes and cyberattacks. Put more bluntly, it will be about dealing with Russia and China. There are likely to be practical and fairly swift benefits as well. One is that cars from Europe become cheaper for households. Right now, a European car is 5 per cent more expensive because of the Australian tariff regime. This puts companies such as Volkswagen, Skoda, Fiat and others \u2013 not just the luxury brands \u2013 at a disadvantage to rivals from China, Japan, Thailand and the US. (All these countries already have trade deals with Australia.) This is good for competition. Australian households are on track to enjoy lower prices for European exports, including luxury cars. Bloomberg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother is that other capital goods also fall in price. While most products get into Australia without a barrier, there is still a 5 per cent tariff on many products from Europe. A cafe might pay more for a coffee machine, for instance. A transport company might pay more for a European truck. There will also be a benefit for farmers who want to export more beef and lamb but have been blocked by EU quotas. In January, the Europeans appeared to be willing to allow 24,000 tonnes of beef and 20,000 tonnes of lamb from Australia each year. This was so low that there did not seem much point in doing a deal. Farrell has pushed for more. Right now, Australia is barred from shipping more than 3389 tonnes of beef to the EU each year, according to Meat and Livestock Australia. It wants an increase to 50,000 tonnes, arguing this is in line with EU agreements with Canada and Brazil. Farm groups in Europe are lobbying to keep the number low. Farrell sounded positive on Friday, which suggests he has made some headway. The \u201cstretch\u201d goal for the Australian side would be anything above 40,000 tonnes. There are other gains to sweeten a final deal. Europe wants access to Australian critical minerals, and there is no reason to turn it away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is likely to be a limited agreement to make it easier for skilled workers to move between Australian and European employers, but this will not be open slather. (Anything more ambitious on visa rules would need approval from national parliaments in Europe.) Jason Collins, who heads the European Australian Business Council, says finalising a deal would be a \u201csmart move\u201d to increase access to 450 million consumers across the EU. Just how much Australian beef can go into European markets has been a sticking point in the trade talks. Joanne O\u2019Keefe The decision to start these trade talks dates back to 2015. Progress was so slow that Farrell walked away two years ago because the Europeans were not offering enough access on beef and lamb. He was right to insist on a better deal. On Friday in Brussels, the trade minister issued a brief statement: \u201cI am confident that both Australia and the European Union will reach agreement that benefits both of our economies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did not say that they \u201ccould\u201d reach a deal \u2013 he said they \u201cwill\u201d. After more than a decade, an agreement is within sight. This will not get as much attention as a Liberal leadership spill, but it represents a quiet economic win for Labor. The gains for households are real. And, in the age of Trump, the strategic benefits are not to be ignored.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAn Aboriginal land council is leading a push for a small but historically significant island in Sydney Harbour to be returned to traditional custodians after the site was listed for sale as part of a sweeping $3 billion sell-off of surplus defence land. Spectacle Island is at the centre of a growing debate about whether prominent public assets with deep historical value should be sold to private interests after the two-hectare former naval outpost was included in a list of 67 defence properties set to be divested by the federal government to fund modern defence priorities. Naval Historical Society president David Michael, pictured with Spectacle Island in the distance, believes the site\u2019s heritage should be maintained. Sitthixay Ditthavong Vacant since 2023, Spectacle Island has played a quiet but consequential role in Australia\u2019s defence history \u2013 first as a gunpowder store established in 1865, later as a naval munitions depot, and more recently as a storage base for the Royal Australian Navy\u2019s heritage collection. The island contains about 40 heritage buildings, including 19th-century powder magazines and laboratories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts listing has ignited discussion about whether surplus defence sites should be sold off or repurposed for public uses such as open space, cultural facilities or social and affordable housing. While the NSW Government has confirmed it is considering housing options for another defence site, Victoria Barracks in Paddington, Planning Minister Paul Scully was less specific about Spectacle Island, saying NSW would \u201cengage constructively\u201d with the federal government as opportunities arose. Spectacle Island on the Parramatta River section of Sydney Harbour, with Cockatoo Island in the background. Getty Images The Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council is preparing a formal request to the federal government for Aboriginal ownership. Metro LALC chief executive Nathan Moran said the proposed sale was an opportunity to address historic land dispossession. \u201cMore than 99 per cent of our backyard has been taken from us and rather than being sold off to private interests for the highest price, this is a rare opportunity for the federal government to help correct past injustices while creating new economic and cultural pathways for our people,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoran said Spectacle Island, together with nearby Goat Island \u2013 which remains subject to final transfer negotiations with the NSW government \u2013 could support Indigenous-led tourism, education programs and cultural events. Spectacle Island is one of 67 defence sites set to be fully or partially divested by the federal government. Fairfax Media \u201cOver 70 per cent of visitors to Sydney seek an Aboriginal cultural tourism experience, and right now there\u2019s nowhere to deliver it at scale within the harbour,\u201d he said. The listing has also sparked speculation that the island could be sold to private buyers and repurposed for uses such as boutique accommodation, hospitality or events. That would align with recent changes to the management of other islands within Sydney Harbour, including the NSW government awarding a tender for a hospitality venue to operate on Fort Denison and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust expanding public access and commercial activity on Cockatoo Island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProperty Council of Australia policy executive Matthew Kandelaars said hospitality and premium tourism were the most plausible commercial options for Spectacle Island, given constraints including water-only access and strict heritage controls. Resort Brokers director Tim Crooks said the island could attract interest from high-net-worth individuals, investors or hospitality groups, with its value potentially reaching tens of millions of dollars depending on permitted uses. \u201cThe sale of an island in Sydney Harbour is an incredibly rare proposition and it will generate a lot of interest, particularly among buyers looking at adaptive reuse options, such as luxury accommodation, events or destination hospitality,\u201d Crooks said. Defence audit documents describe many of the island\u2019s structures as \u201csignificantly degraded\u201d due to water ingress, lead paint and decades of limited maintenance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles, pictured at Victoria Barracks in Paddington, said Spectacle Island is costing millions of dollars to maintain. Peter Rae The buildings are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage Register under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, meaning any buyer would face strict conservation and environmental remediation requirements. Related Article NSW State Parliament \u2018Not surplus land or disposable asset\u2019: Labor MP says Victoria Barracks should be saved UNSW City Futures Research Centre professor Chris Pettit said that while housing had been discussed as an option for other defence sites, Spectacle Island was unlikely to play a meaningful role in easing the housing crisis due to its small size and limited transport access. He said the island had significant international tourism appeal and suggested it would be better managed by a public authority or Aboriginal organisation rather than a private owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe only other option is a multimillionaire buying it as a trophy asset for prestige, but that would not be an equitable use of what has long been a publicly owned site,\u201d he said. Heritage advocates have warned that private ownership could jeopardise the preservation of the island\u2019s historic buildings and military artefacts, including gun turrets and ship bells. Spectacle Island has been included in a divestment program of defence assets. Australian Defence Force David Michael, president of the Naval Historical Society, said preserving the island\u2019s buildings would require significant investment. \u201cIt is Australia\u2019s oldest naval explosives manufacturing and storage site,\u201d he said. Drummoyne state Liberal MP Stephanie Di Pasqua said the proposed sale had \u201ccome as a shock\u201d to many in the community and called for the site to remain in public hands.

And if he did notice the cable, would that have been grounds for a protest?\n\nGuseli reckoned so.\n\n\u201cIf he noticed it, that would be enough to mess you up if you\u2019re in a trick,\u201d Guseli said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that trick, he probably didn\u2019t notice it - but if he did, you\u2019d want a re-run, kind of thing.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, James only found out about it when it was raised with him afterwards by media.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about the cable,\u201d he said. \u201cI should blame it on the cable.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, the result was a case of someone being better than him on the night, and James was not hiding from that.\n\nAs Guseli put it: \u201cI guess they [the shred gods] weren\u2019t with him.\u201d\n\nValentino Guseli in the men\u2019s halfpipe final. Credit: Getty Images\n\nNor were they with him. Guseli, 20, pulled off a score of 88.00 in his third and final run to finish in fifth - his best effort at this level, continuing his progression, but not yet enough to get on on the dais.\n\n\u201cOn the first two runs I sucked, but I landed my last one, and I got one place better than I did at the last Olympics - so we\u2019re going up, which is cool,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading\n\nThe pressure of the occasion and the quality of the field made it tricky for him to compete, and to bring out his best self.\n\nIf he had more time between the Olympics and the ACL injury he sustained in December 2024, could he have rivalled James and the Japanese for a medal?\n\n\u201cSure, but that wasn\u2019t the reality, and I did what I could with my reality,\u201d Guseli said.\n\n\u201cI think if I rode better today I would be in a better place - and I definitely think I could have ridden better, but dealing with the pressure of the Olympics, and especially finals, it\u2019s crazy.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I watched the girls and was surprised with how many crashes there were \u2013 stuff that I\u2019ve seen these girls do really consistently and then on that night they couldn\u2019t really get it. And then, today, I understood why.\n\n\u201cThat kind of finals pressure in the Olympics is massive, and I think everyone felt it a little bit. I think Yuto managed to feel it the least and put down the best run, which is great for him, and unfortunately for Scotty, didn\u2019t get the W [win] that everyone was expecting and hoping for. But it might keep him in the sport a bit longer.\u201d\n\nGuseli couldn\u2019t say if the nerves he felt in Livigno were different to the nerves he felt as a 16-year-old at Beijing in 2022. What he did know was that jagging a medal was within his current capabilities had he executed. And he didn\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cI knew that today, I definitely was going for gold a lot more than four years ago. I didn\u2019t have much experience back then ... going into it I believed that if I did my best snowboarding, that I could have won,\u201d Guseli said.\n\n\u201cI still believe if I did my best snowboarding, I could have won. But I just didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the nature of the game. Sucks to suck, I guess. But it doesn\u2019t really - that\u2019s life.\u201d",
