        "text": "Just days after Japanese encephalitis was detected for the first time this season in Victoria , a second mosquito-borne virus has reared its head across the border.\n\nNSW Health said Kunjin virus had been detected at Cowra in the state's west.\n\nThe virus was found in a blood sample from a sentinel chicken on November 20, collected as part of NSW Health's routine surveillance.\n\nA potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus has been detected in NSW. (Getty)\n\nNSW Health's director of health protection Dr Stephen Conaty said the detections so early in the summer season were concerning.\n\n\"Mosquito numbers will likely increase with warmer weather, and we remind everyone in NSW to protect themselves against mosquito bites, which can cause diseases such as Japanese encephalitis and Murray Valley encephalitis, and infection with Kunjin virus, Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus,\" Conaty said.\n\nThere are now 60 NSW LGAs that are considered to be higher risk of Japanese encephalitis virus.\n\nREAD MORE: Scorching heatwave to smother major city as hot air mass moves across state\n\nA vaccine for JE is available and free for eligible people. (Getty)\n\nResidents and travellers to these LGAs should take particular care to avoid mosquito bites.\n\n\"There is a safe, effective and free vaccine to protect against Japanese encephalitis (JE),\" Conaty said.\n\n\"This vaccine is free to anyone who lives or routinely works in these 60 LGAs west of the dividing range and in northern NSW, and for people who work in some other high-risk occupations.\"\n\nJE vaccine is available through general practitioners, Aboriginal health services and pharmacists.\n\nPeople who meet the eligibility criteria should make an appointment ahead of time and let the provider know it is for the JE vaccine.\n\nThese providers may require a few days' notice so they can order the vaccine and may charge a consultation fee.\n\nA booster dose may be recommended for some people with ongoing risk of exposure, one to two years after completing their primary course.\n\nPeople are urged to use insect repellent. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOther than the JE vaccine, there is no vaccination or specific treatment for Kunjin virus or other mosquito-borne diseases in Australia.\n\nMost people infected with Kunjin virus will suffer no symptoms.\n\nThose who do may suffer fever, enlarged lymph nodes, rashes, swollen and aching joints, headaches, muscle weakness, and fatigue.\n\nThose who do show symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately.\n\nSevere infections can lead to lifelong neurological complications and even death.\ufeff\n\nThe best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are more active between dusk and dawn.\n\nPeople can take actions such as applying insect repellent to exposed skin, wearing long sleeves and leggings with socks and covered footwear, and staying inside at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.\ufeff\n\nMosquito-borne diseases cannot be transmitted directly between humans or from any other animal.\n\nInformation on eligibility for a free JE vaccine is available online here .\n\nInformation on mosquito protection can be found here .\ufeff",

(Eamon Gallagher/AFR)\n\nToday, he is the chief executive of Generation Development Group and his achievements go far beyond how he performed in the pool in his 20s.\n\nThese are his secrets to success.\n\nHow do you start the day to set yourself up for success?\n\nI always wake up at the same time, normally 5.15am every morning. The only time I don't do that is on the weekends, that's where I get my extra bit of recovery. I noticed that in my swimming career, when my sleep periods were different it just made me flat, so consistency of wake-up time is really important.\n\nI have a series of drinks that I have, probably just because of my previous career. I've got a longevity mix, creatine, glutamine, amino acids ... and I have that pre-made the night before so I don't have to think about it in the morning, because I'm not a morning person.\n\nEven though everyone thinks I should be because my former career, I hate early mornings, so I have to make it as easy as possible. I've also got a protein shake that's already set up, I have a water bottle, I'm really quite strict on all of that stuff.\n\nI'll usually do a 45-minute workout in the morning and then the last thing I do after getting ready is always have breakfast with the kids. I'm not the person who tries to get to the office at 7am and get everything done, because I have really young kids and I always try to have breakfast with them.\n\nThat's my time at the table with them on weekdays and I feel quite sad when I don't get that time before I leave for work.\n\nThese days Hackett considers himself a 'corporate athlete' and some of his habits are holdovers from his swimming career. (Dallas Kilponen)\n\nWhat are three daily habits you always stick to?\n\nWhat I always do when I finish my work day is write a 'to do' list before I leave, which will be my first things to tick off the next day. I find that, for me, is an important way to disconnect from the office when I leave. If I don't do that, I'll leave being too analytical about everything else I've got to do and I won't slow down. That, for what I call the corporate athlete, is really important because if you don't get all those little things right like winding down, sleeping well, your cognitive capacity is just not as good.\n\nI also always leave 15 minutes between meetings, because a lot of the time meetings go over and I want to give myself enough time to prepare mentally for the objectives of the next meeting. I don't like meetings for meetings' sake. I like to be really clear on what we're doing there, what we're trying to achieve, and what the actions are. So I always give myself 15 minutes in between each of those, and I always want an agenda for every meeting that I have too.\n\nThe other thing that I'm really, really conscious of as chief executive of a pretty large business is that your energy matters. Even if I'm having a rough day, like all of us do every now and again, I'm always very, very self-aware that the energy I bring in can really set the tone for a lot of other people. So I say good morning and make eye contact and ask how people's weekends were, because that stuff actually matters. It sounds like small talk but it's not, it's setting the energy and tone in the business.\n\nHackett made a massive career change from swimming to finance and admitted it wasn't easy. (AFR/Andrew Quilty)\n\nLots of Aussies are looking for a career change \u2014 what small action can help them get ahead of other candidates?\n\nDevelop relationships with people in a field that you're interested in, or at the very least people who are successful like serial entrepreneurs, because they will give you ideas and insights. I love it when someone comes to me and says, 'this is what I'm thinking about doing, I'd love your advice', or 'I'd love some help'.\n\nAnd be willing to start at the bottom rung of the ladder. Be really, really willing to eat humble pie and start again.\n\nI got day two into finance, this is going back nearly 20 years, and I could win World Championships and Olympics and break world records but I wasn't even the best at the table [in finance]. As soon as I realised that I was like, 'what do I need to do to get to the next level?'. I could have given up. I could have just gone and done talking gigs or other bits and pieces to generate income. I didn't need to be in a completely new field. But I was at the bottom rung of the ladder and recognised what I needed to do to get up that ladder, to get to a position that I feel really proud of. And as soon as you recognise that, you move up surprisingly quick.\n\nWhat financial myth do you wish you never bought into?\n\nIn my teenage mind, when I started trading [stocks], I thought there was going to be two or three stocks that would be huge. I just thought, surely you pick a few winners and all of a sudden it's going to be worth millions of dollars.\n\nThat was probably the myth that was broken very, very quickly for me when I burned some cash on the dot com boom/bust. I realised pretty quick that there's no one stock that is a get rich quick scheme.\n\nThere are no shortcuts in anything I've done that's had some sort of success attributed to it, whether it's financial success, or in sport, or in business. You've got to be willing to do the hard work and maybe look like an overnight success eventually. But even the things that look like they grow quick, they're still really, really hard.\n\nAt 20, Hackett thought he 'knew everything'. He knows better now. (Dallas Kilponen)\n\nWhat do you wish you could tell your 20-year-old self?\n\nThere's a few things that I probably couldn't put in this!\n\nI would tell myself that when things are going really well, and you feel like you're winning, and life's good, it never lasts. So enjoy it, but recognise that nothing ever stays there.\n\nAnd it's true for the opposite; when it hits the fan and things go really, really bad, and you feel like you're getting nowhere in life, and you've hit rock bottom ... it's never that bad. There's always an opportunity, and you can always get back to where you want to be if you're willing to do the work.\n\nI think if I could tell 20-year-old self that I would have saved myself years of anxiety and ups and downs. But my 20 year-old-self thought he knew everything.\n\nIt's so funny, I remember I said my 20s that nothing could go wrong. Everything went right, I felt like life was easy. My 30s were the exact opposite \u2013 divorce, missing my kids, bad publicity. And then my 40s are when you actually start to get life ... it's a really nice stage of life.\n\nHave you got a story?

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft)\n\nWho is responsible for keeping children off social media?\n\nResponsibility for enforcing the ban, which comes into effect on December 10, has been placed on social media companies.\n\nIf children aged under 16 do find their way onto one of the banned sites, they and their parents won't face any penalties.\n\nInstead, the federal government's eSafety agency can take action against tech companies that aren't taking \"reasonable steps\" to keep underage users off their platforms.\n\nThe list of age-restricted platforms includes Facebook, TikTok, and Reddit. (Getty)\n\nWhat are those 'reasonable steps'?\n\neSafety hasn't specified exactly what social media companies need to do to avoid falling foul of the new laws.\n\n\"There is no one-size fits all approach for what constitutes the taking of reasonable steps,\" its regulatory guidance states.\n\nIn a nutshell, though, from December 10, providers need to deactivate or remove the accounts of users aged under 16, and stop those children from being able to immediately create new profiles to get around the ban.\n\nThis includes using geolocation data to check whether a user is an Australian resident, and verify that account holders are 16 or older.\n\nWhile social media platforms can confirm ages by checking someone's government-issued ID, they're required to offer at least one alternative so users aren't forced to hand over their driver's licence or passport.\n\nSocial media companies like Meta are responsible for keeping underage users off their platforms. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft)\n\nCompanies have already begun rolling out age assurance technology, which can estimate and infer someone's age.\n\nThe exact methods vary, but range from getting users to take a video selfie to analysing account behaviour and other metadata.\n\nThe government has acknowledged the ban won't be perfect and some children will get around it, but says it will have an overall positive impact.\n\n\"Just because there are under 18s who will drink alcohol today doesn't mean that it's not a good, important law that we have that you cannot drink under 18,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells said.\n\n\"This is about creating cultural change, and yeah, there's recalcitrance\u2026 we are creating a rule that everybody's off (social media), and the people that get around it, they will be the outliers.\"\n\nAnika Wells has acknowledged some children will still manage to access social media despite the ban. (Kate Geraghty)\n\nThere's also a range of requirements for companies around the data they collect, making sure they don't discriminate against diverse groups, and that users have an avenue to appeal decisions made against them.\n\nThe full eSafety guidance can be found here .\n\nWhat happens if social media companies don't enforce the ban?\n\nIf a social media company breaks the age restriction laws, including by failing to take reasonable steps to keep underage children off its platforms, it will face a fine of up to $49.5 million.\n\neSafety can also take the offending company to court to seek injunctions or undertakings from it in response to any breach.",

        "text": "Transgender women will no longer be allowed to join two of the UK's leading groups for women and girls, in the aftermath of a Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIf you or anyone you know needs help: Transcend Australia (Supporting Australian families and their trans, gender diverse and non-binary children and young people).\n\nKids Helpline on 1800 551 800\n\nThe Women's Institute and Girlguiding announced the changes within days of each other, noting the difficulty of their respective decisions.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman was someone born biologically female, excluding transgender people from the legal definition.\n\nThis judgment related to whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document that gives legal recognition of someone's new gender, was protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain's Equality Act.\n\nBoth groups said their recent decisions were made with legal advice, and in the case of the Women's Institute, the group said the judgment meant it could \"no longer legally offer formal membership to transgender women\".\n\nWomen celebrate the April Supreme Court ruling. ( )\n\n\"As an organisation that has proudly welcomed transgender women into our membership for more than 40 years, this is not something we would do unless we felt that we had no other choice,\" The Women's Institute CEO Melissa Green said.\n\nShe said the organisation would continue to support trans women outside of formal membership.\n\nThe move was made with a \"heavy heart\", according to a joint statement from the Girlguiding heads.\n\n\"This is a decision we would have preferred not to make, and we know that this may be upsetting for members of our community,\" it read, noting adult helper roles were still open to all.\n\nBoth statements can be read in full below:\n\nGirlguiding From Chair of Trustees Denise Wilson, CEO Felicity Oswald, and Chief Guide Tracy Foster: Following April's Supreme Court decision relating to sex and gender, many organisations across the country have been facing complex decisions about what it means for girls and women and for the wider communities affected. Girlguiding's governing charity documents set out that the membership and people who benefit from our organisation are girls and women. The Supreme Court ruled that girls and women are defined in the Equality Act 2010 by their biological sex at birth. Following detailed considerations, expert legal advice and input from senior members, young members and our Council, the Board of Trustees for Girlguiding has made the difficult decision that Girlguiding must change, following the Supreme Court's ruling. From today, 2 December, it is with a heavy heart that we are announcing trans girls and young women will no longer be able to join Girlguiding. This is a decision we would have preferred not to make, and we know that this may be upsetting for members of our community. There will be no immediate changes for current young members, but more information will be shared next week. Most adult roles, including unit helpers, district helpers and administrative support, are already open to all, so we are confident that no volunteers will have to leave the organisation. Girlguiding believes strongly in inclusion, and we will continue to support young people and adults in marginalised groups. Over the next few months, we will explore opportunities to champion this value and actively support young people who need us. A new taskforce will explore ways to support everyone and create new opportunities. Members of all ages are encouraged to contribute to this taskforce to help us shape a future organisation that is inclusive. Girlguiding is proud to be the UK's largest youth organisation dedicated to girls and is focused on creating an equal world for girls and young women. For over 100 years, we have been a welcoming space for all girls to have new experiences, support their communities, build friendships and grow their confidence. While Girlguiding may feel a little different going forward, these core aims and principles will always endure and we remain committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect, particularly those from marginalised groups that have felt the biggest impact of this decision. The Women's Institute From CEO Melissa Green: It is with the utmost regret and sadness that we must announce that, from April 2026, we can no longer offer formal membership to transgender women. As an organisation that has proudly welcomed transgender women into our membership for more than 40 years, this is not something we would do unless we felt that we had no other choice. To be able to continue operating as the Women's Institute \u2014 a legally recognised women's organisation and charity \u2014 we must act in accordance with the Supreme Court's judgment and restrict formal membership to biological women only. However, this change is only in respect to our membership policy and does not change our firm belief that transgender women are women. We know that many of our members will find this decision extremely painful. We have been actively seeking alternative ways \u2014 outside of formal membership \u2014 of continuing to extend fellowship, sisterhood, and support to transgender women, who have been such an important part of our WI family. In April 2026, we will be launching a national network of local WI Sisterhood groups, which will offer monthly opportunities for all people, including transgender women, to come together to socialise, learn from each other, and share their experiences of living as women. Our activity outside of formal membership has always and will continue to play a vital role in creating welcoming spaces where all women can come together to learn, share ideas, and work together to improve lives in our communities. We remain absolutely committed to delivering on that mission.\n\nMove may be influenced by anti-trans campaigners\n\nThe interpretation of the ruling has been disputed by legal advocacy group Good Law Project, which says the law does not \"require trans exclusion\".\n\nIn the case of Girlguiding, the GRC is only available to over-18s.\n\nGood Law Project's trans rights lead, Jess O'Thomson, believed the move came after intense lobbying from \"anti-trans campaigners\".\n\nUK court rules a woman is defined by the gender at birth The court upheld an appeal by a campaign group on whether transgender women are legally women under equality legislation.\n\nIn 2018, anti-trans group Fair Play for Women launched a petition asking Girlguiding to review its policy for trans members.\n\n\"They thought after the Supreme Court decision in April that the whole world would suddenly agree with them,\" O'Thomson said, of trans opponents.\n\n\" But they have misunderstood the law, as well as human nature. \"\n\nThe legal charity said it was prepared to offer legal and financial backing to organisations willing to challenge the ruling's interpretation.\n\nExclusion a 'cruelty', advocates say\n\nHelen Belcher, CEO of TransActual, a leading UK transgender advocacy group, said charities could not afford to fight legal claims surrounding the ruling's interpretation.\n\nShe added the decisions would have an innumerable impact on Britain's \"beloved charities and national institutions\".\n\n\"Our thoughts are with the people who may be outed by their exclusion, or lose access to their vital social groups and support networks at a time when those are more important than ever,\" she said.\n\n\"This government must be held responsible for the long-lasting damage they are doing to a generation of LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\" This is mere cruelty to exclude trans people from doing the things they love with the people who love them. \"\n\nCounter-protesters mocked JK Rowling at an anti-trans demonstration in April. ( )\n\nAround 41 per cent of trans individuals in the UK say they have experienced a hate crime due to their gender identity, according to the latest statistics on the prevalence.\n\nLeading anti-trans campaigner and author JK Rowling said the Girlguiding announcement would \"help girls\".\n\n\"It reminds girls that the desires of boys do not supersede their feelings, their rights, their discomfort or their safety,\" she said on X.\n\nCampaign group For Women Scotland (FWS), which is financially backed by Rowling, spearheaded the April appeal that determined whether transgender women were legally women under equality legislation.",

(Getty Images: Foc Kan/WireImage)\n\nIn March, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director, nearly three decades after she took up the role following the assassination of her brother and the brand's founder, Gianni Versace.\n\nShe was replaced by former Miu Miu head Dario Vitale \u2014 though executives say his move was unrelated to the Prada deal.\n\nNow, with a new owner, Versace will be hoping to be brought back into style.\n\nCultural headwinds\n\nWhen it comes to fashion, Prada and Versace could not be more different.\n\n\"They're kind of polar opposites,\" said Kirstie Clements, the former editor of Vogue Australia, adding Versace had always been \"dynamic\".\n\n\"If you go back to when it was designed by Gianni Versace, [it was] really bright, colourful, sexy, in your face, glitzy,\" she told ABC News.\n\n\"But not over the top because he always had a sense of restraint.\"\n\nVersace is synonymous with bold patterns, glitzy embellishments and seductive silhouettes. (Reuters: Stefano Rellandini)\n\nAlternatively, Prada is a \"more intellectual brand\", said Clements, with its aesthetic not being overtly sexy.\n\n\" They're both very representative of Italian fashion, but super different. \"\n\nPrada's latest collection featured the brand's signature clean lines and a subdued color palette. (Reuters: Alessandro Garofalo/File Photo)\n\nAccording to The Australian Financial Review's fashion editor Lauren Sams, Versace's struggles in recent years can be attributed to a post-pandemic economy, but also \"cultural headwinds\".\n\n\"I think it says a lot when Palazzo Versace, the hotel attached to the fashion brand, that when it opened in Australia, it opened on the Gold Coast and that was the perfect spot for it,\" she told ABC News Channel.\n\n\"It was a place where you could be outsized and sexy and outrageous, and that is what Versace is.\n\n\"That is not really sort of the time at the moment. We are not really having that moment in fashion.\"\n\nA mini skirt with maximum impact\n\nIn 2022, a very short skirt by Miu Miu became one of the most coveted pieces in the industry.\n\nDebuted on the runway the previous season, the pleated, eye-poppingly low-slung mini skirt captured the attention of the front row \u2014 and soon after, the rest of the internet.\n\nThis skirt from Miu Miu was a hit with industry insiders, influencers and celebrities alike. (Getty Images: Vanni Bassetti)\n\nThe mini skirt was seen on Zendaya, Emma Corrin and Emily Ratajkowski, to name a few.\n\nBut no-one sparked more headlines than Nicole Kidman who, at 54, wore the matching set on the cover of Vanity Fair, later saying she \"begged\" stylists to let her wear the viral outfit.\n\nNicole Kidman was one of many celebrities to wear the viral outfit. (Supplied: Vanity Fair)\n\n\"Prada has had its 'on seasons' and its 'off seasons', but it's had a lot of publicity through Miu Miu,\" Clements said.\n\n\"It did that little belt skirt. All the influencers were wearing it. It's all about getting a viral moment.\"\n\nDario Vitale debuted his first Versace season in September, with the spring/summer 2026 collection during Milan Fashion Week.\n\nDario Vitale's debut collection with the brand paid tribute to Gianni Versace. (Instagram: @Versace)\n\nThe collection referenced the brand's 1980s Gianni Versace era, with critics calling it everything from bold and brash to fun and audacious.\n\n\"If you look at that collection, it's really different and it was very divisive. Not everybody loved it,\" Clements said.\n\n\"But when I looked at it I thought, 'That's interesting, that's a move forward,' because I think Versace was stuck.\"\n\nMade in Italy\n\nVersace was previously owned by US luxury group Capri Holdings.\n\nNow, under Prada, it's going back to its roots.\n\n\"'Made in Italy' is a really important designation for Italian designers and I think bringing it back into an Italian company is going to be a really important part of its future,\" Sams said.\n\nA look from one of Donatella Versace\u2019s final collections during her time as creative director. (AP: Antonio Calanni)\n\nBut in Clements opinion, Prada still has \"a lot of work to do\" in order to make Versace profitable.\n\n\"Do they buy something else? Do they buy Armani? Are they going to turn into an Italian conglomerate?\" she said.\n\n\"It's quite a tricky time in fashion. They're looking for brands that have a solid philosophy like Versace does.\"\n\nPrada is not yet on the level of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which owns 75 brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Mo\u00ebt & Chandon.\n\nHow Anna Wintour redefined fashion over almost 40 years As US Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour forever changed the fashion industry.\n\nBut Clements said Prada's purchase of Versace could be the beginnings of an Italian luxury group that could one day rival French luxury group Kering, which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen.\n\nTrends come and go, and come back again \u2014 so will Versace rise to the occasion once again?\n\n\"100 per cent, if you get it all right,\" Clements said.\n\n\"If you get the right celebrities, the right influencers, the right people on board \u2014 and it's the right clothing for the moment \u2014 you can do it.",

        "text": "Navigating pregnancy and early parenting advice can be overwhelming \u2014 and for many parents, the confusion begins in the supplement aisle.\n\nOne of the first things women planning a pregnancy or in the early stages of one are advised to do is take a prenatal supplement containing folic acid \u2014 the synthetic version of folate, or vitamin B9 \u2014 and iodine.\n\nIodine is essential for a baby's brain and nervous system development, while folate is particularly important in early pregnancy to help prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida.\n\nBut there are scores of supplements to choose from, many of which contain a plethora of vitamins and minerals, sometimes in vastly different amounts.\n\nAdding to the confusion is the fact many newer supplement companies substitute folic acid with methylfolate \u2014 a lesser-studied form of folate, often claimed to be more easily absorbed \u2014 and usually at heftier prices.\n\n\"It's very hard standing in the pharmacy to negotiate those claims, to understand what is effective, what is cost-effective, and what is safe,\" Alexis Shub, obstetrician and maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Mercy Hospital for Women, said.\n\nSo what ingredients are essential in a prenatal supplement? And when should you start taking one?\n\nWhat supplements are recommended in pre-conception and pregnancy?\n\nNational pregnancy care guidelines recommended women take 400\u2013600 micrograms of folic acid per day ideally from four weeks before conception and throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFor women at increased risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 such as those with a family history, or who have diabetes \u2014 a higher dose (5 milligrams per day) may be recommended.\n\nFolic acid supplementation substantially reduces the risk of neural tube defects, but does not prevent all cases. (Pexels: MART PRODUCTION)\n\nWhen it comes to iodine, all women are advised to take a daily supplement containing 150 micrograms when they're planning a pregnancy, pregnant and breastfeeding. (Women with a pre-existing thyroid disorder should seek medical advice first.)\n\nIf you haven't taken a supplement prior to conception \u2014 and it's estimated half of all pregnancies in Australia are unplanned \u2014 it's recommended you start once you become aware you're pregnant.\n\nTo reduce the risk of nutrient deficiencies and neural tube defects across the population, bread products in Australia are also fortified with folic acid and iodine. Since mandatory fortification was introduced in 2009, neural tube defects have fallen by 14 per cent.\n\nWhat's the difference between folic acid and other types of folate?\n\nWhen you consume folate through food or folic acid, your body converts it into methylfolate (also known as L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 5-MTHF). It does this with the help of an enzyme made by the MTHFR gene.\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of supplement companies have developed prenatal formulations that contain methylfolate instead of folic acid.\n\nTypically, they're promoted as being more \"bioavailable\" (or easier to absorb) and therefore a better choice, especially for people with MTHFR gene variations, which can slightly reduce the gene's effectiveness.\n\nTests to consider if you're planning pregnancy Government guidelines recommend seeing a GP three to six months before you become pregnant.\n\nBut Shelley Wilkinson, a prenatal dietitian and an obstetric medicine researcher at the University of Queensland, said that wasn't the case, and stressed that folic acid was the only form of folate that had been shown in trials to help prevent neural tube defects.\n\n\"The majority of people will be able to get the folate they need from [folic acid] supplements and food,\" Dr Wilkinson said.\n\nAustralian pregnancy guidelines (and other international health authorities) note that pregnant women with MTHFR variations \u2014 which are estimated to affect 60\u201370 per cent of the population \u2014 can still process all types of folate, including folic acid.\n\nAccording Dr Shub: \"When people look at blood levels of folate in women with MTHFR variants, they're the same when they've taken folic acid as women who don't have that mutation.\"\n\nIt shouldn't be assumed, she said, that methylfolate supplements \u2014 which are typically more expensive \u2014 work in the same way as folic acid to support neural tube development.\n\n\"The data around neural tube defect prevention is all with folic acid \u2026 so for women who take other variants [of folate], we just don't have that information.\n\n\"The other problem with [methylfolate] is that it's not as stable \u2026 it's susceptible to changes to light and temperature, and so what you think you're getting in your vitamin might not be what's actually in there.\"\n\nFolic acid intake is more important for determining blood folate levels than having a MTHFR variant, health authorities say. (Getty Images: Galina Zhigalova)\n\nClaire Roberts, who leads the Pregnancy Health and Beyond Laboratory at Flinders University, said while supplements containing methylfolate were \"likely\" to help to prevent neural tube defects, and may even be beneficial for some women, there wasn't enough evidence to confirm that.\n\nWhat about other vitamins and minerals?\n\nVitamin D testing during pregnancy used to be recommended, as was supplementation for women found to be deficient, but Australia's national pregnancy care guidelines were recently updated to advise against this.\n\nThe guidelines note that while routine vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy \"may offer some benefit\", there's insufficient evidence to recommend testing or supplementation as part of standard pregnancy care.\n\nWhen it comes to supplementing other key vitamins and minerals, the guidelines currently recommend:\n\nCalcium : recommended for women at risk of high blood pressure\n\n: recommended for women at risk of high blood pressure Iron : recommended for pregnant women based on blood test results at 28 weeks\n\n: recommended for pregnant women based on blood test results at 28 weeks Vitamin B6 : not enough evidence to detect clinical benefits in pregnancy, though it may help to reduce nausea (high doses, however, can lead to serious adverse outcomes \u2014 see below)\n\n: not enough evidence to detect clinical benefits in pregnancy, though it may help to reduce nausea (high doses, however, can lead to serious adverse outcomes \u2014 see below) Vitamin B12 : not enough evidence to draw conclusions, though it may benefit women who are vegetarian or vegan\n\n: not enough evidence to draw conclusions, though it may benefit women who are vegetarian or vegan Magnesium : not routinely recommended\n\n: not routinely recommended Omega-3 fatty acids : may reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are low in omega-3\n\n: may reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are low in omega-3 Vitamin A and E : high-dose supplementation not routinely recommended for pregnant women with no identified deficiency or clinical need\n\n: high-dose supplementation not routinely recommended for pregnant women with no identified deficiency or clinical need Vitamin C : high-dose supplementation not routinely recommended for pregnant women with adequate dietary intake\n\n: high-dose supplementation not routinely recommended for pregnant women with adequate dietary intake Zinc : guideline under review\n\n: guideline under review Other minerals (e.g. selenium) : not enough evidence to draw conclusions\n\n: not enough evidence to draw conclusions Probiotics: guideline under review.\n\nWith the exception of folic acid and iodine, Dr Shub said there was limited evidence for many of the ingredients in prenatal supplements, and that for the majority of pregnant women (without risk factors or known deficiencies), a balanced diet would provide most of the nutrients they needed.\n\n\"If women are trying to do the best thing in their pregnancy, a healthy diet and exercise is still the best way to go. Although that can be difficult, spending money on [multi]vitamins is probably not a good use of money.\"\n\nGetting vitamins and minerals through a varied, wholefood diet offers benefits that can't be obtained from supplements, experts say. (Pexels: Kei Scampa)\n\nDr Wilkinson agreed: \"There's a lot you can get from a well-planned diet \u2014 omega-3, so DHA and EPA [two types of omega-3 fatty acids] can be obtained, and choline [a nutrient important for fetal development] \u2026 is in meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs, green leafy veggies, legumes, and potatoes.\"\n\nEvidence for choline supplementation is mixed, though some experts suggest it may help women meet their recommended daily intake.\n\nDr Wilkinson acknowledged that many Australians struggled to get enough fruit and vegetables in their diet, and encouraged pregnant women concerned about their nutrient intake to work with an accredited dietitian or their healthcare provider to create a \"food-first approach\".\n\n\" Eating a nourishing diet is going to be more important than finding the 'right' supplement. \"\n\nWhy more is not always better\n\nDr Wilkinson said while many women took pregnancy supplements containing a range of vitamins and minerals for \"peace of mind\", there was a risk of consuming too much, particularly if women were taking a combination of products.\n\n\"We've seen it with vitamin B6, which can be in magnesium [supplements], energy drinks, multivitamins and morning sickness tablets.\"\n\nShe said she had seen some pregnant women who were taking more than 50 times the recommended daily amount of vitamin B6, which in high doses can cause irreversible nerve damage.\n\nAustralia's national medicines regulator recently reported that high doses of B6 could lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in the first trimester.\n\nDr Wilkinson recommends using a supplement that contains folic acid and iodine at the recommended dose. (Pexels: Nataliya Vaitkevich)\n\nHigh doses of vitamin A, C and E can also be dangerous during pregnancy: \"It's why women should not take non-pregnancy multivitamins,\" Dr Shub said.\n\nUnnecessarily high doses of recommended vitamins can also pose potential health risks, said Professor Roberts, whose research has found a link between excess maternal folate levels and a rise in gestational diabetes.\n\n\"It's almost like there is a sweet spot \u2014 too little is not good, and too much is not good,\" she said.\n\nIn a small 2023 study, Dr Wilkinson and her colleagues found 5 per cent of pregnant women exceeded the safe upper level of intake for folic acid (1,000 micrograms per day), and almost 50 per cent exceeded the upper limit for iron.\n\nWhile folic acid supplementation is only recommended during the first trimester, research suggests many women continue to take it in the second and third trimesters as part of a prenatal multivitamin.\n\nDr Wilkinson said this was generally OK, given daily folate requirements were increased during pregnancy, but advised women against taking \"large amounts\" that might put their daily consumption above the recommended upper limit.\n\nCalls for better regulation and labelling\n\nUnlike registered medicines, most vitamin supplements in Australia aren't evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration before they hit the market.\n\nThe TGA regulates the safety and quality of AUST L products by limiting them to use only pre-approved low-risk ingredients, however many are not assessed for efficacy, placing them in a regulatory \"grey area\", Dr Wilkinson said.\n\nABC Health in your Instagram feed Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.\n\nShe and Professor Roberts said they'd like to see increased regulation of prenatal supplements to help consumers make evidence-based choices.\n\n\"Women want to do the best thing for their baby, and they have an awful lot of guilt if they don't,\" Professor Roberts said.\n\nDr Wilkinson added that increased oversight could help women avoid paying for products they didn't need.\n\n\"It could be a lot cheaper and easier if you took what you needed, rather than what you're marketed.\"",

(ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nBut the decision now by the state government to retain and expand an area of land declared in 1991 for opal miners \u2014 Restricted Area 257 \u2014 has been welcomed by the industry.\n\n\"It's pure relief,\" Boulder Opal Association secretary Alison Summerville said.\n\n\" I've made several phone calls today to particular families who have been waiting on tenterhooks and it's a wonderful Christmas present for all of us. \"\n\nMs Summerville said many people feared the national park designation would force generational miners out of the leases they held on Vergemont.\n\nMinister for Natural Resources and Mines Dale Last said it showed the government's commitment to backing the resources sector, including small-scale opal miners.\n\nThis boulder opal found on Vergemont is valued at $300,000. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\n\"The change of government was a significant factor in retaining this industry for the future,\" Ms Summerville said.\n\nThe government said the acquisition of Vergemont Station and the nearby former stations of Tonkoro and Melrose would create a corridor of protected land to safeguard habitat and rare and threatened species, along with significant Indigenous cultural heritage.\n\nEnvironment Minister Andrew Powell said the park was part of a plan to add 1.8 million hectares to the state's protected areas by 2028.\n\n\"The proposed new national park will safeguard the significant ecological values of the unique landscape,\" Mr Powell said.\n\nThe department also confirmed new park rangers had been employed to manage the former station and other protected areas in the region.\n\nThreatened species like the night parrot and purple-necked rock wallaby live on Vergemont.

(ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nThe fine print\n\nMs Summerville said everyone who had a mining tenure within the Restricted Area 257 was \"safe\".\n\n\"Every single piece of mining tenure, whether it was a mining claim, a mining lease or an EPM [exploration permit for minerals] has been retained and will be retained for the future in opal mining,\" she said.\n\n\"The fine print was always going to be the difficult part \u2026 what we wanted was to be sure of the future.\"\n\nThe decision to retain and expand the opal mining area ends months of unease. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nMs Summerville said 47,000 hectares on the eastern and western edges of Vergemont had been protected from mining, but it was not considered significant opal-bearing ground.\n\nThe state government has also proposed giving small-scale miners access to an additional 155,000 hectares for prospecting.\n\nThe proposal would add 494 sub-blocks to the existing restricted area.\n\nBoulder opals from Vergemont are sold around the world.

We will continue to fight to save as many jobs as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe CPSU welcomed the focus on senior-executive positions being cut.\n\nCuts fall short of report's recommendations\n\nThe review itself, finalised and handed to the treasurer in June, recommended slashing 2,000 jobs.\n\nIn May, the treasurer also foreshadowed that cuts would focus on the state's public entities and boards, which cost $35 billion every year.\n\n\"Victoria has over 500 entities and 3,400 boards and public committees, so you can't tell me there's not some fat to cut there,\" Ms Symes said in her May budget speech.\n\nToday's cuts announcement will see the number of public entities reduce by 29 \u2014 far fewer than the 78 recommended in the review.\n\nThe Silver review estimated reducing the number of public entities by 78 would save $427 million over four years. The government initially claimed it would save the same amount, despite slashing 49 fewer than recommended, but later admitted those savings would only amount to $27 million.\n\nUnder the changes, the government also says it will halve the number of business regulators by 2030.\n\nThe establishment of a new regulator called Safe Food Victoria will combine separate food safety regulators for dairy and meat.\n\nPremier announces cost-cutting review Premier Jacinta Allan announces a review of public sector spending that could see up to 3,000 public sector workers made redundant.\n\nThe Victorian Legal Services Board will be merged with the Legal Admissions Board, while HealthShare Victoria and VicHealth \u2014 responsible for healthcare procurement and health promotion respectively \u2014 will be absorbed into the Department of Health.\n\nThe review made 52 recommendations. The government accepted 27 in full, three in part and 15 in principle.\n\nMs Symes said the government may choose to revisit some of the recommendations it had chosen not to accept.\n\n\"That is not necessarily indicating that we won't go further in the future; it's recognition that some of her recommendations will take some time,\" she said.\n\n\"For example, her recommendation to combine a lot of the workplace regulators is something that has merit, but right now I have a piece of legislation in the parliament that affects the labour hire authority.\n\n\"Now is not the time to merge other entities into that organisation while we're bedding down important functions.\"\n\nVictorian Opposition Leader Jess Wilson said the report was an admission of failure by the government to rein in spending. (ABC News)\n\nIt rejected seven recommendations, including a proposal that the government pause building more early learning and childcare centres beyond those already operating or under construction, as well as cut funding for musical instruments in secondary schools.\n\nThe government also declined to merge the state's retail water authorities, despite recent bungles with Greater Western Water's billing system, noting \"the different needs and infrastructure requirements of local communities\".\n\nVictorian Opposition Leader Jess Wilson said the Silver review was \"a $4 billion admission of failure\".\n\n\"Labor's mismanagement and top-heavy bureaucracy is driving Victoria deeper into debt and starving critical funds from the frontline community safety, health and housing services Victorians deserve,\" she said.\n\n\"This report issues a stark warning over the dire impact Victoria's soon-to-be $1 million an hour interest bill is having on our capacity to deliver frontline services now and into the future.\n\n\"These supposed savings are a drop in the ocean. Since this report was handed to Labor in June, Victoria's net debt has grown by almost twice the claimed savings Labor's cuts will deliver.\"",

        "text": "After the initial discussion about private investment, the discussion at the Senate's economics legislation committee has shifted to another topic.\n\nOn Monday night, officials from the National Audit Office were asked about the matter of Treasury making payments worth $2.3 billion to the states that may have been in breach of the constitution.\n\nIt relates to some passages in Treasury's 2024-25 annual report, which was published on October 24.\n\nTreasury's annual report contained this passage:\n\nCompliance with Statutory Conditions for Payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund\n\nSection 83 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (the Constitution) provides that no amount may be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund except under an appropriation made by law. Treasury has controls in place to reduce any instances of non-compliance with section 83 wherever possible and ensure there is no intentional misuse of funds. Recovery action is taken to rectify any instances of non-compliance as soon as it is identified. During 2025-25, Treasury continued to monitor and adapt its verification procedures for payments made under the Federation Financial Relations Act 2009 and the Federation Reform Fund Act 2008. The Treasury identified that eight payments made to the States and Territories in 2024-25 totalling $2.28 billion relating to the Energy Bill Relief extension scheme were in breach of section 83 of the Constitution. The payments were made without appropriate written ministerial authorisation in place for the senior official to approve the payments on the Minister's behalf. The States had met the requirements for the payments therefore the potential breaches are technical in nature. Written authorisation from the Minister for the relevant senior officials to approve these payments was put in place and internal processes updated to align with the revised authorisation.\n\nOfficials from the National Audit Office appeared before Senate estimates on Monday, and they were asked about it.\n\nHow could Treasury make eight payments totalling $2.28 billion that were in breach of the constitution?\n\nHere's how part of that conversation went:\n\nLIBERAL SENATOR JAMES PATERSON: How would you characterise payments of this volume being made without ministerial authorisation? MS CARLA JAGO, GROUP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: We expect that all payments are made in accordance with the law. Steps were taken in this instance, when the issue was identified, to rectify that so that they were retrospectively authorised. Senator PATERSON: But prior to those steps being taken, these payments were unlawful, weren't they? Ms Jago: Our understanding is that they were in breach of section 83 of the Constitution before they were retrospectively authorised. Senator PATERSON: Is it a serious thing, in the ANAO's view, that a department is making unlawful payments to the tune of $2.3 billion? Ms Jago: We see any potential breach of section 83 of the Constitution as a serious matter. Senator PATERSON: Is there a difference between a technical breach and a serious breach of the law? Ms Jago: I'm not sure what a technical breach versus a serious breach\u2014 Senator PATERSON: Nor am I. That's why I am asking. MS RONA MELLOR, DEPUTY AUDITOR-GENERAL: You'd appreciate that we're very black-and-white people. A breach is a breach. Senator PATERSON: You should be, and I agree with you. A breach is a breach. An unlawful payment of any money is a worry but particularly when it's $2.3 billion. Ms Mellor: You would hopefully be aware that, in December, we would normally table a summary of all financial statements and results, and we do include in that summary what we call 'L findings', or breaches, and there will be some. This one, in the evidence Ms Jago's given, sounds like it was rectified and wouldn't be reported as a breach, because it was rectified. But certainly, as we're auditing, when we see legislative breaches, we report on those to the parliament at the end of the calendar year.\n\nIn my next post, I'll cover what Ms Wilkinson had to say about the matter.",

        "text": "Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt could be the centre of a trans-Tasman tug-of-war after Australia and New Zealand were pitted in the same group at a Rugby World Cup for the very first time.\n\nThere were groans of excitement when the All Blacks landed alongside the Wallabies in Pool A at Wednesday night's much-anticipated draw for the 2027 global showpiece in Australia.\n\nThe southern hemisphere superpowers will both be unbackable favourites to beat minnows Chile and Hong Kong China in their other two pool matches, leaving the winners of the Bledisloe Cup-like battle certain to top the group.\n\nWhat is anything but certain, though, is Schmidt's future beyond his two-and-a-half-year tenure with the Wallabies.\n\nThe New Zealander will hand over the Wallabies coaching reins to Les Kiss next August after answering an SOS call from Rugby Australia to stay on until after his successor completes his 2026 Super Rugby commitments with Queensland.\n\nSchmidt had initially been due to finish up after this year's series against the touring British & Irish Lions before twice having his contract extended by Rugby Australia.\n\nAsked on Wednesday night if he would consider staying on in some capacity \u2014 most likely as an advisor to good friend Kiss \u2014 until the end of the World Cup, Schmidt offered a coy, \"not at this stage\".\n\n\"At the end of July is when I finish, and I've just hugely enjoyed the group,\" he said.\n\n\"They work really hard for what they get and it will be tough to walk away and leave them in what I believe is good hands.\"\n\nSchmidt has a son with severe epilepsy in New Zealand.\n\n\"So some of the other priorities I've got \u2026 I've had two weeks at home in the last five months,\" he said.\n\n\"So I think getting home a bit more often will be the preference at this stage.\"\n\nPressed further on whether Kiss could twist his arm, Schmidt said: \"Yeah, look, I've had the privilege of coaching in three World Cups and loved and hated them in different measures depending on how things work out.\n\n\"I've been good friends going back a fair way with Les and so we'd always be chatting anyway.\"\n\nSchmidt was an All Blacks assistant coach at the 2023 World Cup in France, when New Zealand lost an epic final 12-11 against the Springboks.\n\nThe 60-year-old would be an obvious target for the NZRU, especially given the draw and his insight on the Wallabies.\n\nAnd he didn't completely close the door on a return to the All Blacks, leaving the door ajar when quizzed about the prospect.\n\n\"I'm not looking to be involved at all, either side,\" Schmidt said.\n\n\"I may well be in the stadium watching. I'd say that I'll just be delighted to be there and spectating because Rugby World Cups are really special occasions.\n\n\"Having been at three of them, just the whole atmosphere around them.\n\n\"It builds into a crescendo for match days and some of the gatherings around stadiums and those sort of things.\n\n\"I'm just excited that it's only two years away now and I can't wait for it to come up and, in some ways, I can't wait not to be involved so that I can just enjoy it because it's pretty nerve-wracking when you're in the midst.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe result of their historic first pool showdown with the All Blacks will shape the seventh-ranked and struggling Wallabies' path to an improbable fifth World Cup final.\n\nIf they conquer the mighty All Blacks, the Wallabies would almost certainly face two-time defending champions South Africa in the quarterfinals.\n\nIf they lose to New Zealand, the hosts would likely meet Eddie Jones's Japan in the round of 16, then England in the quarters and either Ireland or Argentina in the semifinals.\n\n\"In a World Cup, if you want to win it, you've got to beat the best teams,\" skipper Harry Wilson said after Wednesday night's draw.\n\n\"There are a lot of potential paths you can go down.\n\n\"But if we get the Springboks in a quarter-final, it will be exciting.

He\u2019s come back and expressed that he\u2019s got some things to think about, and Shane needs to make a decision now.\u201d AP: Do you believe that he\u2019ll be at the helm of Wests Tigers for the start of next year? DP: \u201cWe\u2019ll respect his decision. That\u2019s up to Shane, and he\u2019ll come back to us.\u201d AP: It feels like everything is in limbo until we know whether he\u2019s going to be the CEO of the Wests Tigers long term. Have you had discussions with him about a time frame as to when he will decide?\n\nDP: \u201cI\u2019ve been in discussions with Shane \u2026 asking when he would come back with an answer. He responded that he\u2019s still thinking about it but will come back with an answer on Monday \u2026 it really needs to be resolved sooner rather than later.\u201d AP: You talked about a lack of communication \u2013 and obviously the four independent directors are no longer there \u2013 what responsibility does Shane Richardson bear for that? DP: \u201cI think some of the decisions that were made, that should have come to the Holman Barnes Group for approval, certainly didn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s coming from the CEO and the board.\u201d AP: Is there anything in the [ownership] agreement whereby certain actions taken by the football club have to come back to you either for ratification or to inform you of what\u2019s going on? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s correct. In the agreement, there is a threshold limit that if transactions \u2013 let\u2019s say transactions above a certain limit \u2013 need to come back to Holman Barnes Group for approval.\u201d\n\nAP: Such as player signings above a certain [financial] limit? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Wests Tigers CEO Shane Richardson. Credit: Oscar Colman AP: And that hasn\u2019t been happening. DP: \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d\n\nAP: The narrative is that there has been some discontent about the jersey, that it contains too much Tiger and not enough Magpie. Is that the case? DP: \u201cThe colours of the jersey have not come up at all as part of this process. I think that\u2019s a rehash of some old narrative \u2026 this has been floating around for years. This is trivial, and to think this is a reason for Holman Barnes Group taking this decisive action is laughable.\u201d AP: The other thing that\u2019s been discussed recently is this idea that there\u2019s a push for Western Suburbs Magpies to take over, to push Balmain out of the joint venture. Is that the case? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s not the case at all. The Holman Barnes Group is fully supportive of Wests Tigers. There\u2019s been no talk about bringing back the Magpies. Once again, I think that\u2019s a narrative that\u2019s been rehashed from a couple of years ago.\u201d AP: There\u2019s no doubt the Holman Barnes Group has a good track record of managing clubs \u2013 but less so when it comes to football clubs. It\u2019s been 14 years since the Tigers last finals appearance. Why should fans have any faith in the regime?\n\nDP: \u201cWell, that\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to rectify under Benji Marshall\u2019s leadership. If the football operation can keep progressing as they have, they\u2019re on the improve. We\u2019d like to see us get back to playing finals football.\u201d AP: What do these changes mean for Benji Marshall? DP: \u201cBenji has got our full support. He\u2019s an absolute club legend and we think he\u2019s a great coach. We absolutely want him here for the long term.\u201d Wests Tigers coach Benji Marshall has the full support of the Holman Barnes Group. Credit: Getty Images AP: ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys said he is concerned about what had transpired at board level and that he wanted the NRL to investigate. Are you concerned that head office is concerned?\n\nDP: \u201cI think because it\u2019s a purely governance issue between the boards \u2013 and there is a current agreement in place with Holman Barnes Group and Wests Tigers \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that NRL should be concerned over this.\u201d AP: Should they be concerned about the performance of Wests Tigers because obviously the two are tied together? DP: \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re progressing in the right direction. So I think if the NRL looks at on-field performance as well as financial performance, then we should be heading towards the finals.\u201d AP: Is there still tension between Balmain and Western Suburbs, the two factions in the joint venture marriage? DP: \u201cIn the past, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of tension between Wests and Balmain. We\u2019ve had the Balmain board meet with the Wests Ashfield board, and what\u2019s been great is that I feel like we\u2019re more unified than ever. For example, Wests Ashfield has made it clear to Balmain that we want them to be part of the joint venture.\n\n\u201cThey retain their 10 per cent share in West Tigers, they retain their board seat in Wests Tigers. Wests Ashfield will continue to fund the Balmain Football Club and is now funding the Balmain District Juniors. So we\u2019re very much committed to supporting Balmain and continuing on in the joint venture.\u201d AP: At some clubs, it\u2019s pretty easy for the membership, if they are disgruntled, to affect change. For instance, at Canterbury, you only need to get about 110 signatures to force an extraordinary general meeting. Under the ownership structure with the Holman Barnes Group, and its relationship with Wests Tigers, there\u2019s basically no lever to pull if you\u2019re a disgruntled member or a fan. You need to be a debenture holder, and it\u2019s all very tightly controlled. Can you understand their frustration in that they are seeing this [boardroom brawl], they are seeing a lack of performance on the field, and there is nothing they can do about it? DP: \u201cAbsolutely, I can see the frustration \u2026 I\u2019m a fan myself, but we are progressing in the right direction. With the right people in place at the football department, I think we will progress and continue to progress. On-field performance is everything, and that\u2019s what we need to focus on.\u201d The long-term future of Tigers playmaker Jarome Luai remains unresolved. Credit: Getty Images AP: Speaking of things on the field, two of your highest profile players, Jarome Luai and Jahream Bula, have yet to commit long term. They have clauses or options in their contracts in their favour, and it was suggested they were close to committing \u2013 until the latest developments. Are you concerned that they might slip through your fingers because of what\u2019s transpired?\n\nDP: \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the football department. I haven\u2019t seen the contracts, so I\u2019m not aware of the clauses that we\u2019re talking about. However, I do believe that they\u2019re close to re-signing, and I\u2019d like to think they would.\u201d AP: A protest march has been arranged. Are you concerned about disgruntled Wests Tigers fans making their presence felt and making their voices heard? DP: \u201cWe understand the passion that fans have and we appreciate that this announcement has caused upset. We have no problem in fans making their voices heard, however marching to Wests Ashfield and potentially intimidating innocent staff members is not something we would condone and I would urge the organiser to rethink this action.\u201d AP: Should all the [feeder teams, such as NSW Cup, Jersey Flegg, etc] be playing under the Wests Tigers jersey, banner and logo, given it is supposedly one club? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s something for the new Wests Tigers board to start getting their head around and make decisions on.\u201d\n\nLoading AP: What\u2019s the position of the Holman Barnes Group on that? \u201cThe Holman Barnes Group obviously has a number of teams under their umbrella, Wests Tigers and Wests Magpies being two of those, as well as the registered clubs. So we support all our teams.\u201d AP: Will the Holman Barnes Group now start sticking their beak into football, interfering and meddling in football matters? DP: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not for the Holman Barnes Group to get involved with football operations and player signings. But it is their responsibility to ensure that due diligence is done correctly around the selection of those players. So it\u2019s just ensuring that governance and those systematic measures are in place.\u201d",

Silver called for the government to cease funding programs that provide musical instruments and doctors for high schools, and reduce the Better Boating Fund, all of which were rejected. However, it agreed to end a paid special leave program for health workers with COVID-19, in place since the pandemic. Targeted reviews of TAFE were recommended, but the government only committed to support this on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe Independent Review of the Victorian Public Service, which was commissioned by Treasurer Jaclyn Symes in February shortly after she moved into the job, urged the government to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d to reduce the sprawling growth of public sector entities since the pandemic. \u201cThere are good reasons for establishing entities to achieve a policy goal at a particular point in time, and they employ many talented and dedicated staff,\u201d the Silver review found. Loading \u201cHowever, the large and growing number of public entities and their complexity are creating duplication and confusion, and stifling public and private sector productivity.\u201d The report found that the substantial direct and indirect cost to the government of maintaining these entities and an extraordinary 3200 public boards and committees \u2013 a number greater than any other state or territory \u2013 undermined efforts to reduce public spending.\n\nSymes said the measures adopted by the government would make the public sector more efficient while avoiding frontline job cuts. \u201cFrontline workers are excluded from the scope of this review,\u201d she said. \u201cBringing together entities with similar functions makes it quicker and easier for individuals and businesses to interact with government by offering cleaner points of contact and fewer processes and forms to deal with.\u201d Symes said she accepted Silver\u2019s analysis that Victoria\u2019s large number of entities, and their complexities, could be confusing and put a handbrake on public and private productivity. \u201cNot only is it tying up some bureaucrats\u2019 time, it\u2019s creating numerous doors of entry for citizens, stakeholders and businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cTime is money. I hear this when I\u2019m out there talking to the business community.\u201d\n\nSymes said the public service had too many executive positions and not enough graduate and entry-level roles. She would not be drawn on how the savings would affect her operating surplus for this financial year. An updated figure for this will be reported on Friday as part of the state\u2019s mid-year budget update. The full recommendations of the Silver review, which were presented to the government in July, would have netted budget savings of about $5 billion. Opposition Leader Jess Wilson said the review was an admission of failure, accusing the government of mismanagement and a top-heavy bureaucracy that was driving debt. \u201cThis report issues a stark warning over the dire impact Victoria\u2019s soon to be $1 million an hour interest bill is having on our capacity to deliver frontline services now and into the future,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese supposed savings are a drop in the ocean. Since this report was handed to Labor in June, Victoria\u2019s net debt has grown by almost twice the claimed savings Labor\u2019s cuts will deliver. \u201cThe only ones cutting jobs and services are Premier Jacinta Allan and Treasurer Jaclyn Symes.\u201d Community and Public Sector Union state secretary Jiselle Hanna said it was good the treasurer had not embarked on bigger job cuts as first feared, but rejected the review\u2019s suggestion the government should be smaller. \u201cGovernment already cannot do what Victorians expect it to,\u201d she said. \u201cThe blind-faith obsession with outsourcing costs the state more by reducing our capability,\n\nincreasing long-term costs, and making budget repair harder.\u201d",

        "text": "Each station also has accessible toilets, parents\u2019 rooms and adult changing place facilities. A Travellers Aid hub at Parkville will open soon and help passengers get between the station and nearby hospitals. Stations could do with more seating, though. Good: Architecture and design The Arden station entrance features massive concrete arches lined with more than 100,000 hand-laid bricks, reflecting North Melbourne\u2019s rich industrial history. Credit: Justin McManus It\u2019s hard not to be impressed walking through the five new underground stations. High ceilings and wide platforms create a sense of space and openness that is a world away from their grubby City Loop counterparts.\n\nArden station\u2019s redbrick arches will surely become one of the city\u2019s architectural landmarks. The coupling of raw cement \u2013 most impressively in State Library station\u2019s arched entrance \u2013 with Art Deco-inspired lighting and fixtures reflects the city above it. It feels undeniably Melbourne. Signage is clear, and the connections between CBD interchange stations are intuitive to follow. There are escalators galore \u2013 including a wall of five at the State Library entrance \u2013 to avoid the passenger congestion experienced at other CBD stations, and provide redundancy during breakdowns (looking at you, Southern Cross).\n\nBad: Deja vu The quiet State Library station on Monday morning. Credit: Justin McManus The platforms at Town Hall and State Library look nearly identical \u2013 especially on board an arriving train. And because not every cement column on the platform is signed, it might not be obvious which station you are arriving at. Making the two stations distinct was a missed opportunity to explore different design ideas while making life easier for commuters.\n\nGood and bad: Anzac tram interchange The canopy at Anzac isn\u2019t up to the job. Credit: Wayne Taylor Anzac station\u2019s integrated tram stop works excellently. Transferring from St Kilda Road trams and directly down into the station takes just a couple of minutes. For many, getting on a train here will be quicker than taking a tram all the way up Swanston Street. It doesn\u2019t all work well, though. The 85-metre wooden canopy at Anzac is an attractive structure \u2013 but too small to protect passengers from the elements while transferring to/from a tram. It also fails to stop rain falling onto Anzac\u2019s concourse. Staff had to erect \u201cwet floor\u201d signs there during light rain on Monday.\n\nGood: Platform screen doors Platform screen doors improve safety and comfort. Credit: Simon Schluter Platform screen doors at each of the five stations are a big step up for passenger comfort. There\u2019s no loud whoosh of air as trains arrive or depart. They make platforms safer, quieter and easier to keep warm and cool. One nifty feature: the displays showing passenger loads in each carriage on the next arriving train, so you can board at a door with the most room. Not all doors are in use right now, however, and this could be signed better. Metro is operating seven-carriage trains in the Metro Tunnel, but the platforms are long enough to accommodate 10-carriage trains in the future. Doors not in use have signs that say \u201cBoard trains this way \u2192\u201d but The Age saw plenty of passengers expecting trains to arrive there, perhaps thinking the sign indicated the direction of travel.\n\nGood: Artwork Danie Mellor\u2019s work Forever at State Library station. Credit: Wayne Taylor Future generations of Melburnians will be grateful for the public artworks included at the new stations. Patricia Piccinini\u2019s colourful ceramic tiles at Parkville seem to be a favourite among visitors. Danie Mellor\u2019s work Forever, consisting of photographic portraits of Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung women printed on huge glass panels along La Trobe Street, is a beautiful addition to the city.\n\nBad: Advertising onslaught The unfinished digital advertising screen at Town Hall station. Credit: Gemma Grant When taking the escalators from the new City Square down into Town Hall station, passengers come face-to-face with a large wall crying out for another mural or artwork. Instead, an enormous LCD screen \u2013 we\u2019re talking IMAX here \u2013 will assault commuters with \u201cimmersive 3D anamorphic display\u201d advertising. A three-screen digital wrap-around also detracts from the State Library station\u2019s impressive entrance.\n\nThe stations were supposed to celebrate Melbourne\u2019s history and people. Too many of them have fallen victim to the rapacious commercialisation of public life. The wraparound advertising screens at State Library. Credit: Wayne Taylor Bad: Fast food The use of retail space is uninspired. There\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s at Town Hall, while Parkville has a Maccas and a KFC. The doctors at the Royal Melbourne and Peter Mac won\u2019t love that patients have access to so much junk food on their doorstep. The iconic Campbell Arcade is now accessible from Town Hall. It was home to an independent coffee shop, a record store and the Sticky Institute zine hub before it was emptied during construction. Let\u2019s hope it rekindles that quirky and creative spirit when the shopfronts are leased out again.\n\nBad: CBD station myki glitch The underground concourse connecting State Library station to Melbourne Central. Credit: Jason South Town Hall station connects to Flinders Street Station. State Library connects to Melbourne Central. Passengers can transfer between them without going through myki gates \u2013 in effect, forming two CBD mega stations served by both the Metro Tunnel and City Loop. But the myki ticket system treats them as separate stations.\n\nLoading Usually, if you enter a station, change your mind about travelling and exit the same station within 15 minutes, you are not be charged a fare. But if you enter Town Hall, change your mind and then exit via the Melbourne Central gates, your myki will be charged. Transport Victoria says it is working to change this, and also make it possible for anyone to use these underpasses without touching on. Until then, one gate is left open at Town Hall and State Library.\n\nBad: Bicycle parking The absence of secure or even undercover bicycle parking at Arden, Parkville or Anzac is a baffling oversight. There are bicycle hoops, all vulnerable to the elements and thieves. Loading Good bicycle parking can encourage commuters to combine a short bike ride with a train journey, massively enhancing the catchment of people who can access a station. The Dutch, of course, do this best: at Utrecht station, commuters can ride directly into its three-level, 12,500-bike underground parking facility. That might be overkill for Melbourne. But the Metro Tunnel stations don\u2019t even have the lockable Parkiteer bike cages, which are installed at many suburban stations.\n\nGood and bad: Public space The revamped City Square, above Town Hall station, is a welcome addition to a CBD that is starved of communal space. It\u2019s a shame that other opportunities to create new public spaces were missed. The project initially planned to permanently close Franklin Street (between City Baths and RMIT) to create a new pedestrian zone and public space, but that was scrapped. The redeveloped City Square. Credit: Joe Armao The Swanston Street vehicle-free zone should have been extended north to A\u2019Beckett Street, past State Library station.\n\nLikewise, one or both sides of Flinders Street were closed for years during construction. People have gotten used to it. It could have stayed closed to make room for the tens of thousands of pedestrians set to pour out of Town Hall and Flinders every morning. Instead, they\u2019ll have to squeeze onto already overcrowded footpaths when it reverts to a traffic thoroughfare. Bad: Soft launch timetable Almost every Melburnian will be aware that the Metro Tunnel is now open. But how many will have read the fine print? It is only open between 10am to 3pm on weekdays, and until 7pm on weekends. Trains run only every 20 minutes. The full timetable starts on February 1.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that some people will leave home thinking they can get a train to Parkville, only to find the tunnel is closed for the day. Visitors here for the Australian Open and other events this summer will be confused too. Bad: The line with no name In New York you can get on the \u201cA\u201d train to Harlem. Londoners ride the Jubilee and Suffragette lines. Metro Tunnel will operate the newly connected Sunbury and Cranbourne/Pakenham lines. Passenger information displays at Anzac. Credit: Wayne Taylor\n\nNot just a mouthful, it can be confusing, too. Melbourne\u2019s train lines are named after their final terminus (the Hurstbridge Line, the Glen Waverley Line). That\u2019s fine if they only travel into the CBD and back again to their origin. It doesn\u2019t work for the 100 kilometre end-to-end Metro Tunnel. As it stands, Pakenham Line trains go to Sunbury, and Sunbury Line trains go to Cranbourne or East Pakenham. If they applied the convention used on the London Underground, customers would be told they need a \u201cMetro Line: Sunbury\u201d train to travel towards Sunbury. Much easier to understand.\n\nGood: Cross-city travel People say the Yarra is the physical and psychological barrier that divides Melbourne. I\u2019d argue the City Loop is just as significant. The Metro Tunnel bridges the divide, making it possible to travel directly from the outer north-west all the way to the outer south-east. Over time, this will change how Melburnians conceive the city and their place in it. People will be more willing and able to cross the city for work, study or leisure. Melbourne will be a smaller, more connected place.",

Swan was as gloriously irreverent as Spike. He mentioned his family and kids but added they didn\u2019t deserve any thanks because they weren\u2019t around when he played. Besides, he loves them, \u201cbut I don\u2019t necessarily like them all the time\u201d. He thanked his teammates, but \u201cthey rode on my coat-tails, so I probably don\u2019t need to thank them\u201d.\n\nSwan is the most disarmingly entertaining after-dinner speaker and interviewee in football. Self-deprecating and dry, he thanked the fans for their support, \u201calthough there are no fans here, we all know it\u2019s just rich people and players\u201d in the room. The rich people and players guffawed loudly. \u201cThe love I received from the fans, and I guess as a \u2018Rat Pack\u2019 we did, clearly you made me bigger than what I was or what I am. So I thank you for that,\u201d he said. Dane Swan and Alan Didak celebrate the club\u2019s 2010 premiership. Credit: Joe Armao And this is the nub of Swan. An outrageously good footballer in his peak years after 2007 or 2008 until his retirement, he was just outrageous in his early years. He described himself as a kid who was as surprised as anyone to find himself on an AFL list.\n\nLoading \u201cI got dropped halfway through the year I got drafted for having a poor attitude which may shock some people, then I played three good games, and they drafted me off the back of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a got some wonderful memories from those first four years [in the AFL] but none of them have got anything to do with football. They are all hazy now \u2013 I was pretty good off the field. \u201cObviously, the best thing that happened to me in the AFL was \u2013 and it\u2019s not for everyone, but it obviously worked for me \u2013 I went out and got arrested.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s probably not for everyone.\n\nBut for Swan, it was the moment that prompted a new career-saving commitment. At a time when the club was bottoming out and playing kids he was given another chance. Had it not been for his arrest on assault charges in 2003 and changing his ways, he \u201cwould have been given the arse at the end of the year and that would have been it\u201d. \u201cI got 50 games I didn\u2019t deserve. Mick [Malthouse] was extremely hard on me; in those team meetings he used to say some pretty mean stuff and say some personal stuff I didn\u2019t even know about myself. I thought, \u2018Someone is going to have to tell my parents, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened here\u2019.\u201d \u201cObviously, the best thing that happened to me in the AFL was \u2013 and it\u2019s not for everyone, but it obviously worked for me \u2013 I went out and got arrested.\u201d Dane Swan The club didn\u2019t need to be bullied to include Swan in their Hall of Fame. His Brownlow Medal, his premiership, and his powerful indefatigable run and nous to find the goals had already made certain of his inclusion. It was not hyperbole for Matthews to say he was in the conversation as the best player in the competition at one stage. For a period of four or five years, he was clearly among the best in the AFL. But playing ability and achievements were only part of the reason, and in fact the lesser of the reasons, for the warmth with which Swan is held at the club. Swan was the everyman who played unlike the everyman. He was tattooed \u2013 he said that helped his mystique \u2013 and was not so wound up in the self-importance of the AFL as to be unable to laugh at it, and himself.\n\nHis most telling comment was that he never wanted to be the best footballer he could be, he wanted to have the best life he could have. He understood work-life balance in football before it was a thing. He commanded play with the ball and was ringmaster away from the field. He led a group of similarly talented players \u2013 Alan Didak, Ben Johnson, Chris Tarrant \u2013 who shared a thirst for life after hours. \u201cI hope one day the Rat Pack get put in here as a group,\u201d he said, to loud laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing but I\u2019m serious. \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t on the Men For All Seasons calendars, I wasn\u2019t built like that. We\u2019re just normal everyday guys who just happened to play on the MCG, we\u2019re out doing whatever else is doing.\u201d\n\nThis relatability is the reason he can upstage even Matthews, a football icon who has homes everywhere and nowhere, having been the player of the century at Hawthorn, coached flags at Collingwood and against them at the Brisbane Lions, but loves them all in different ways. Collingwood were the perfect fit for Swan. Dane Swan was a footy character who was beloved by the fans. Credit: Getty Images This is a club of Tony Shaw and Lou Richards. A club where a member of the original Magpie Rat Pack now runs the club. Before Swan, Didak, Johnson and Shaw, there was Craig Kelly, Denis Banks, Mick McGuane and, of course, Darren Millane. Kelly is now the CEO. The club embraced their past this night opening a new Hall of Fame section in the rebuilt museum. It includes Millane\u2019s locker from the Victoria Park change rooms. It\u2019s sparseness, sitting alone in the room, adds to the poignancy of recognising the premiership player who died in a car accident in his prime.",

        "text": "The International Monetary Fund has estimated that Ukraine will have a \u20ac65 billion shortfall in its budget over the next two years without financial aid. About two-thirds of Ukraine\u2019s government revenues are now devoted to the war effort. It desperately needs more cash. Loading A stumbling block to a EU plan to use the Russian assets as collateral for a \u20ac140 billion loan to Ukraine has been Belgium\u2019s unwillingness to expose itself to Russian litigation if there is a peace deal, sanctions on Russia are lifted and Moscow demands the return of its money, which Euroclear would have a contractual obligation to comply with. That could leave Belgium on the hook for the funds, and facing insolvency. Russia has, indeed, threatened 50 years of legal warfare against Europe if its assets are touched. It would also probably seize Western financial assets (the amounts aren\u2019t known) that it froze in retaliation for the G-7 sanctions. The latest EU proposal would involve Euroclear making an interest-free loan equivalent to the value of the Russian assets it holds, which would be used to repay EU countries for money already lent to Ukraine, with the rest lent to Kyiv.\n\nUkraine wouldn\u2019t be required to repay the loan unless and until it received compensation \u2013 reparations \u2013 from Moscow for the damage the war has done to its infrastructure and people. The cost of remediating the damage that the war has inflicted on Ukraine has been estimated at close to the equivalent of a trillion Australian dollars. An option that has been considered in response to Belgium\u2019s concerns is that some or all of the EU member states provide guarantees that they would underwrite the repayment of the \u201creparations\u201d loan should Russia refuse to pay for the damage it has done. Alternatively, the EU could just borrow the money itself and lend it to Ukraine, hoping that repayment would be secured in future peace negotiations.\n\nWhile a loan to Ukraine, whether backed by Russia\u2019s assets or not, would give the Europeans a direct stake in the outcome of the peace negotiations being undertaken by the US (with minimal involvement by Ukraine), it could also place the guarantor nations at financial risk if the US forces Ukraine into a deal on Russia\u2019s terms. Loading That could happen. Under the 28-point plan that the US presented to Russia last month (with, it seems, considerable input from the Russians), apart from ceding Ukrainian land that Russia doesn\u2019t currently control along with that it does occupy, an exclusion from Ukraine joining NATO and reducing the size of its military, all sanctions on Russia would be lifted. The agreement specifically said that frozen Russian funds would be used in US-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine, with the US receiving 50 per cent of any profits. The EU would contribute $US100 billion ($150 billion) to the reconstruction funding. The rest of the frozen funds would be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle for joint projects. While the Russians rejected the proposals, the Trump administration has made it clear that it views the ending of the war as a commercial opportunity (surprise, surprise) and is less concerned about Ukraine\u2019s interests \u2013 and those of the Europeans \u2013 than it is in its own and in Donald Trump\u2019s desire to have his name on a peace deal, regardless of its quality.\n\nIf Ukraine\u2019s interests are to be protected, it will be by the EU, not America. That the bulk of Russia\u2019s offshore reserves are held within Europe does give the EU leverage to participate in any settlement, though it is extremely difficult, indeed near-impossible, to obtain a consensus from with a 27-member bloc that contains some pro-Russian voices. If the EU can agree on a mechanism for funnelling, directly or indirectly, the value of the Russian assets held within Europe to Ukraine, it would give it a place at the table because it would signal to Russia that Ukraine would have the money to sustain its defence for at least the next two years. Russia might have had some successes on the ground in Ukraine, at considerable cost in lives and equipment, but the war is taking an increasingly severe toll on its own economy, which is in the grip of stagflation, on the brink of recession and where the government\u2019s focus on military spending is causing significant economic stresses in regions not benefiting from the war effort. A recent tightening of US sanctions on Russia oil exports, targeting both Russia\u2019s major oil producers and, critically, their customers, will cut further and harder into Moscow\u2019s revenues and its ability to fund the war without risking more domestic economic hardship and social unrest.",

Last week, we learned that Chris Bowen is a part time energy minister delivering a part time energy grid. This week, we learnt that Annika Wells is a part time communications minister, but a full-time frequent flyer ... And today, we learn that Tony Burke has held secret meetings about the return of so-called ISIS brides to Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Ley is demanding answers from the Labor government on what senior ministers, including Foreign Minister Penny Wong, knew about the brides, and when, as well as on other matters.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research reveals nearly two in five Australians fear they will never be able to retire, as housing and living costs continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to MFS Investment Management, about 38 per cent of superannuation members now share that concern, up from 28 per cent last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-thirds of survey respondents expect to work longer than planned.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing has become the top financial worry, overtaking everyday expenses, with inflation close behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer than half of retirees are confident their savings will deliver enough income throughout retirement.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTen major social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and, most recently, Twitch, will face fines of up to $50 million dollars if they fail to remove accounts belonging to Australians under 16 from the 10th of December.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eSafety Commissioner will issue notices to all ten platforms on 11 December demanding data on account removals, followed by monthly requests for six months.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulators say courts could impose the maximum penalty where breaches are systemic or repeated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells says the government expects platforms to implement age checks carefully but firmly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe government recognises that age assurance may require several days or weeks to complete fairly and accurately \u2026 One week from today, this law is starting. Over the coming months, we will fight to defend this law in the High Court because parents right across Australia asked the government to step up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle says the reform is misguided and that it does not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nHong Kong\u2019s deadly high-rise fire has claimed at least 159 lives, as police arrest six people suspected of disabling fire alarms during maintenance at the housing complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictims ranged from a one-year-old child to a 97-year-old resident.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice say they have now searched seven of the eight towers engulfed by the blaze, which burned for more than 40 hours, though around 30 people remain unaccounted for.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner of Police Joe Chow says the operation is far from over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, this is the interim, but we have not finished our work yet because as you can see the scaffoldings, a lot of bamboos, that they have fallen down. So, we still need to do some work on those bamboos to see any remaining or any bodies were covered by these bamboos.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities say suspected human remains have been found in several apartments, with DNA testing now underway.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Palestinians, including two children, have been killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, according to medics at Al-Kuwaiti Hospital in Khan Younis.\n\n\n\n\n\nA tent sheltering displaced people in the southern part of the enclave was among the sites hit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military says the strike targeted a Hamas fighter after what it described as a ceasefire breach, accusing militants of attacking Israeli troops near Rafah and injuring five soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel will respond to any harm to its forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaza's health authorities say 357 Palestinians have been killed over the first 50 days of the ceasefire, while Israeli authorities say three Israeli soldiers have been killed in the same period.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport and in football, Chelsea's Premier League title hopes have suffered a major setback, with a humbling 3-1 defeat at Leeds United which lifted the hosts out of the bottom three.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacking start from Leeds was rewarded with a sixth minute goal when Jaka Bijol powered in a header from the corner and the home side doubled their lead, with Ao Tanaka scoring a stunner two minutes before halftime.\n\n\n\n\n\nChelsea pulled one back five minutes after the break, through substitute Pedro Neto, but their comeback attempt was ended when a mistake at the back gave Leeds a third goal in the 72nd minute, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin wrapping up the win.\n\n\n\n\n\nChelsea coach Enzo Maresca says Leeds were impressive opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think they were better than us in all the aspects, they deserved to win the game. There is nothing that we can take from this game. The only thing we can do is try to understand the mistake we have done, try to reset, because again in 48 hours we have one more game.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The cost of a comfortable retirement is higher than it's ever been, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peak body's CEO, Mary Delahunty, said, fortunately, the average balance of superannuation accounts has also risen to a record high.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average balance is sitting at $172,834 for nearly 18 million superannuation account holders over the age of 15. For those aged 65 to 69, the average balance is around $420,934.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More Australians than ever before are reaching retirement with meaningful super behind them,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it might not feel that way to many Australians.\n\n\n\nWith the eye-watering cost of living putting pressure on families and economic uncertainty overseas making Australians anxious , two new guides have outlined how much you need to support your retirement.\n\n\n\nSo how much will you need?\n\nThere are many factors that influence how much money you'll need, such as age pension eligibility, whether you own your home, and your living situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost calculations consider a more modest budget option versus a more comfortable lifestyle, including things like overseas travel and subscriptions to streaming services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to ASFA, coupled homeowners 65 and over will need $76,505 each year to live comfortably in retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nA single person will need around $54,240 each year.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News That's an increase of 3.5 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively compared to this time last year, and it's directly connected to the rising cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group estimated retirees over 85 who own their home would need less money, offering about $71,104 as a guide for a couple and $47,534 for a single person.\n\n\n\n\n\nA separate estimate from Super Consumers Australia, a group that advocates for lower- and middle-income super consumers, suggests that a typical single homeowner will need around $322,000 in superannuation for a comfortable retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCouples will need a combined $432,000.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In contrast, for those living a 'modest lifestyle', the estimated annual budget was approximately $20,000 lower, as they typically spend less on health insurance, cars, and take fewer holidays, among other expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say it may take even less in superannuation to have a secure retirement, especially if you own your own home.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Moloney, the deputy director of the housing and economic security program at the Grattan Institute, previously told SBS News the real cost of retirement could be even lower, as retirees typically spend less once they stop working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you look at people's spending habits from pre-retirement to post-retirement, what you see is that people spend less in retirement and increasingly so as retirement goes on,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pensioners benefit from a bunch of discounts on council rates, electricity, medicines and other benefits that add up to an implicit income of thousands of dollars a year.\"\n\n\n\nWhere have prices risen most?\n\nWith the consumer price index rising in the September quarter to 1.3 per cent , and a 3.2 per cent increase over the past year, more people are spending money on daily essentials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the September quarter alone, electricity prices have risen by 9 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past twelve months, the increase is closer to 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of eating out has risen by around 1.3 per cent, while those staying in are paying 9.3 per cent more for media services.\n\n\n\nDelahunty said the holidays will be a challenging time for many retirees because prices have risen fastest in the things they spend most on, like \"food, energy and health\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some older people may cut back on pricier gifts, travel and social occasions to stay on top of the basics,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe pointed to recent reforms, including the move to 12 per cent super and Payday Super , that could give people more security over their retirement savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenge now is to keep strengthening the system so every Australian has the best possible chance of a comfortable, dignified retirement, not just at Christmas but all year round.\"\n\n\n\n",

That's 9.7 million additional rent they've collected under this system. And there now needs to be some sort of accounting process about how this is going to be rectified with clients who have paid increased rent under this unlawful system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are set to become the first non-NATO nations to help fund the purchase of critical military equipment for Ukraine under a new $95 million package.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government will today unveil the additional support, including $50 million for the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List, through which NATO co-ordinates the acquisition of US-made defence assets for Kyiv.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia will also donate $43 million worth of A-D-F supplies, including tactical air-defence radars, munitions and combat-engineering equipment, alongside a further $2 million for advanced drone technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement lifts Australia\u2019s total assistance to more than $1.7 billion since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Senate Estimates committee has heard that Communications Minister Annika Wells recent trip to the United Nations General Assembly cost taxpayers almost $100,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials confirmed that $94,828 was spent on flights for the minister and two staff, which included Ms Wells' own travel budget of $35,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trip was spruiking Labor's social-media-ban for under 16's at a meeting of world leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked to justify the cost, Ms Wells says the trip fuelled global momentum for the world leading policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reason you know all those things is because we're transparent about them and we will disclose them and we'll continue to disclose information about that trip through the usual processes that trip was undertaken as the Minister for Communications and I think and I would think the people who were there for that UN event who join us in this room today would agree with me that it was incredibly important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHamas has handed over a recovered body to members of the Red Cross to be repatriated back to Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has confirmed receiving a body believed to be of a dead hostage held in Gaza through the Red Cross.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remains have arrived at an Israeli forensics institute for examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHamas also handed over remains on Tuesday which Mr Netanyahu's office later said were not of any hostage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe handover of the last two hostages' bodies in Gaza would complete a key condition of the initial part of U-S President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Israel says it will reopen the Rafah border crossing and would start allowing Palestinians wishing to leave Gaza to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents forced to flee their homes in Hong Kong are being allowed to return and retrieve their belongings after a deadly fire killed at least 156 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith authorities collecting evidence in a criminal probe into the fire, it remains unclear when residents can return to the building.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 30 people remain missing and fifteen have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n37-year-old Hong Kong resident Trent Heung says people want justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think justice is number one.

        "text": "As temperatures rise, so do many Australians' energy bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe high cost of keeping their homes at a comfortable temperature is, according to new research from Energy Consumers Australia (ECA), driving millions of renters to avoid it altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\nECA's latest Consumer Energy Report Card, released on Thursday, found that 70 per cent of a poll of 1,428 renters nationwide were avoiding heating or cooling their homes to save money.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, two in five (40 per cent) of those polled said they couldn't afford to keep their home at a comfortable temperature on hot days without using a lot of energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor cold days, the national figure was 32 per cent.\n\n\n\nDespite being one of the warmest parts of Australia, renters in the Northern Territory were the most reluctant to heat or cool their homes due to the cost. Source: SBS News ECA's executive manager of analysis and advocacy executive manager, Ashley Bradshaw, said the findings supported the need to introduce minimum energy efficiency standards for rental properties across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the one hand, renters are telling us they're avoiding using energy, but on the other hand, they're also telling us that their bills are generally a lot higher than any household of the same size,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without some sort of mandatory enforceable standards, renters are going to keep living in homes that are too hot in summer, too cold in winter, and very expensive to run.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparate data by research firm SECNewgate polled 1,208 Australians and found 65 per cent of respondents supported a minimum efficiency standard for rental homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of 1,056 respondents, almost half said landlords should cover the cost of home upgrades to meet minimum energy-efficiency standards, with government support. Another 27 per cent said landlords should pay the full amount, 14 per cent believed the government should fund the upgrades, and 7 per cent said the cost should be shared between landlords and tenants.\n\n\n\nWhat are minimum energy efficiency standards?\n\nMinimum energy efficiency standards can include requirements such as draught-proofing and proper insulation, and the installation of energy-efficient appliances.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ECA data suggest just over a third of rentals in Australia have at least one form of insulation, compared to 78 per cent of owner-occupied homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimateworks Centre's buildings lead, Gill Armstrong, said: \"We know that rentals are in really worse shape than other housing segments like owner-occupiers, and we know that tenants just can't upgrade \u2014 they've got no rights to do that \u2014 so we need that requirement for landlords to have minimum rental standards throughout all the states.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it should be guesswork as to whether this home is going to be acceptable to live in or you're going to have really high bills,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Who will feel the heat? The suburbs in Australia most at risk from extreme heat revealed\n\nBoth Victoria and the ACT are progressively introducing minimum energy efficiency standards for rentals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means more than two million rental homes are in jurisdictions without any minimum, enforceable energy-efficiency requirements, according to ECA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the moment, some state restrictions are simply very high level, just that the house needs to be 'in working order' \u2014 essentially words around that respect \u2014 so nothing at all related to energy efficiency,\" Bradshaw said.\n\n\n\nWhat changes are being proposed?\n\nBradshaw said ECA first wants to see the disclosure of a home's energy efficiency rating made mandatory at the point of lease in every state and territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A [rating of] 10 is this theoretically perfectly-efficient house, where almost the internal temperature of the house is irrespective of the outdoor temperature,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the other hand, a zero star would essentially be you are literally outside, a one star would be a tent.\n\n\n\nAustralian homes are of \"very poor quality\" when it comes to energy efficiency, Bradshaw said. Source: Getty / Maryna Terletska \"I think the average rating of a house in Australia is 1.8, so we're kind of closer to a tent in terms of certain quality of homes, particularly rentals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBradshaw said that would then be followed by the progressive introduction of minimum energy-efficiency standards, making homes unable to be rented out unless they meet a certain benchmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we look forward, we're going to seemingly have more extreme weather and see the health and societal impacts of that, so it becomes more and more important.\"\n\n\n\nHow much could energy efficiency standards save you?\n\nHaving a better-insulated home with more energy-efficient appliances means you don't need to use as much power or have appliances running for as long to make your living environment comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong said that can result in a significant cut to your annual energy bills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Depending on the size of your home and how much heat or cool you like, we're looking at saving a considerable amount per year \u2014 up to $2,000, our modelling showed, particularly in the homes that are the lowest performers,\" she said. \"So that's no insulation and things like you've got gaps around windows, you've got old vents that are not blocked up, so your house is very leaky.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How heatwaves can wreak havoc on your mental health\n\nBut the benefits extend far beyond cheaper energy bills, Bradshaw and Armstrong said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can also make your home quieter, reduce pressure on the energy grid, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and improve your physical and mental health and well-being.\n\n\n\nHow to get a more energy-efficient rental\n\nRegardless of whether minimum energy efficiency standards have been introduced where you live, Armstrong said it was worth talking to your landlord about upgrading your home.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows most landlords have no idea what their rental properties feel like in summer or winter, so you should let them know exactly how your home \"is not fit for purpose\", she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd communicate that as best as possible and document why the home is too hot, too cold, any air vents that are from past gas appliances that may have been removed that you can see daylight coming through, show them copies of bills, and suggest ways forward,\" Armstrong said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Your Home website by the federal government has heaps of advice that landlords can follow.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Centrelink has refunded only 338 of the 44,000 people who overpaid their debt to the social services provider, with Services Australia confirming to SBS News the total amount refunded is already at $2.9 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 2,700 people who were owed refunds died before the problem was identified, a Senate estimate hearing was told .\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Birrer, deputy chief executive officer for payments and integrity at Services Australia, said at Senate estimates on Tuesday that they were alerted to an issue regarding repayments around March this year by internal staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These instances go back to 2007. There's a range of cases, with a certain cluster around the period from 2017 to 2019,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs reported by Guardian Australia in October, Services Australia said the problem was caused by a procedural error around automatic deductions, and not related to the widespread robodebt scheme currently subject to the biggest class action in Australian history .\n\n\n\nBirrer said on top of those refunded, a further 111 cases were found not to be owed money.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Services Australia told SBS News they began contacting people impacted in late October 2025, but have been undertaking a thorough investigation since March to ensure \"clarity and certainty\" for customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as more details were revealed on Tuesday about the challenges Services Australia had faced returning the money, Greens spokesperson for social services, Penny Allman-Payne said she was \"flabbergasted\" so little progress had been made.\n\n\n\nSome owed more than $5,000\n\nBirrer told estimates that around two per cent of people who overpaid, or around 880 people, were potentially owed over $5,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average amount already paid to the 338 who have received money is around $8,579 each.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother roughly 31 per cent, around 13,000 people, were owed anywhere between $51 and $500.\n\n\n\nDeputy CEO at payments and integrity group at Services Australia, Chris Birrer, told Senate estimates they were alerted to the issue in March. Source: Supplied A further 28 per cent overpaid between $1 and $50, with the remaining 22 per cent owed $1 or less.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained they were tackling the higher amounts first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've done a phased approach starting with the high-value potential overpayments, so people out of pocket the most are getting quicker service from us,\" he told Senate estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the overpayments were from people receiving the aged-care pension, and around 2,700 had died before the problem was identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that case, Birrer said, they were still attempting to return the money to families of the deceased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do attempt to contact estates and executors and beneficiaries, and that's a standard process.\"\n\n\n\n'Flabbergasted' at the delay\n\nAllman-Payne told Birrer she was \"flabbergasted\" at how long it was taking Services Australia to pay the money they owed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Birrer explained that their systems are \"large and complex\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some cases, he said, officers learn the recipient has already been refunded, but the payment \"was not recorded in a way that was evident in the customer's record\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Services Australia told SBS News that it's \"essential\" to do due diligence, and that this has taken time.\n\n\n\nGreens senator Penny Allman-Payne said it was \"beyond belief\" for a government department not to notice the mistake for nearly twenty years. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, Allman-Payne said it was \"beyond belief\" that a government department could have wrongly taken money for two decades and not know about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The welfare system is full of holes like these because Labor and the Liberals have spent decades harassing welfare recipients, rather than making sure the public service takes them seriously,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Services Australia couldn't provide a firm timeline for fixing the problem, a spokesperson told SBS News more than 60 per cent of those impacted are not current customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are only able to make refunds to people we have current bank account details for or can successfully contact,\" they said.\n\n\n\n",

Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nAs for hybrid working, this had a major well-being boost for women, but only in particular situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen women spent some time on-site or in the office each week, and worked from home, the biggest mental health gains were noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nGains were comparable to those from a 15 per cent rise in household income.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor women with poorer mental health, flexible work arrangements led to better mental health.\n\n\n\nThe study noted less work stress and helping women to juggle work and life were other benefits of working from home.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor men, working from home did not make a measurable effect on mental health, positive or negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report mentioned that this could be due to the unequal division of domestic and caregiving responsibilities, which disproportionately fall on women and constrain their spatial mobility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers with poorer mental health were found to be more sensitive to long commutes and most likely to benefit from flexible working arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor women commuting, there was no detectable effect. But for men, longer commutes equated to poorer mental health for those who already had issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a man near the middle of the mental health distribution adding half an hour to his one-way commute reduced reported mental health by roughly the same amount as a 2 per cent drop in household income, the authors wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor workers who don\u2019t have problems with their mental health, commuting and working from home don\u2019t have much of an impact on them. Yet they still may value flexibility, the study found.\n\n\n\n",

He\u2019s come back and expressed that he\u2019s got some things to think about, and Shane needs to make a decision now.\u201d AP: Do you believe that he\u2019ll be at the helm of Wests Tigers for the start of next year? DP: \u201cWe\u2019ll respect his decision. That\u2019s up to Shane, and he\u2019ll come back to us.\u201d AP: It feels like everything is in limbo until we know whether he\u2019s going to be the CEO of the Wests Tigers long term. Have you had discussions with him about a time frame as to when he will decide?\n\nDP: \u201cI\u2019ve been in discussions with Shane \u2026 asking when he would come back with an answer. He responded that he\u2019s still thinking about it but will come back with an answer on Monday \u2026 it really needs to be resolved sooner rather than later.\u201d AP: You talked about a lack of communication \u2013 and obviously the four independent directors are no longer there \u2013 what responsibility does Shane Richardson bear for that? DP: \u201cI think some of the decisions that were made, that should have come to the Holman Barnes Group for approval, certainly didn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s coming from the CEO and the board.\u201d AP: Is there anything in the [ownership] agreement whereby certain actions taken by the football club have to come back to you either for ratification or to inform you of what\u2019s going on? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s correct. In the agreement, there is a threshold limit that if transactions \u2013 let\u2019s say transactions above a certain limit \u2013 need to come back to Holman Barnes Group for approval.\u201d\n\nAP: Such as player signings above a certain [financial] limit? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Wests Tigers CEO Shane Richardson. Credit: Oscar Colman AP: And that hasn\u2019t been happening. DP: \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d\n\nAP: The narrative is that there has been some discontent about the jersey, that it contains too much Tiger and not enough Magpie. Is that the case? DP: \u201cThe colours of the jersey have not come up at all as part of this process. I think that\u2019s a rehash of some old narrative \u2026 this has been floating around for years. This is trivial, and to think this is a reason for Holman Barnes Group taking this decisive action is laughable.\u201d AP: The other thing that\u2019s been discussed recently is this idea that there\u2019s a push for Western Suburbs Magpies to take over, to push Balmain out of the joint venture. Is that the case? DP: \u201cThat\u2019s not the case at all. The Holman Barnes Group is fully supportive of Wests Tigers. There\u2019s been no talk about bringing back the Magpies. Once again, I think that\u2019s a narrative that\u2019s been rehashed from a couple of years ago.\u201d AP: There\u2019s no doubt the Holman Barnes Group has a good track record of managing clubs \u2013 but less so when it comes to football clubs. It\u2019s been 14 years since the Tigers last finals appearance. Why should fans have any faith in the regime?\n\nDP: \u201cWell, that\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to rectify under Benji Marshall\u2019s leadership. If the football operation can keep progressing as they have, they\u2019re on the improve. We\u2019d like to see us get back to playing finals football.\u201d AP: What do these changes mean for Benji Marshall? DP: \u201cBenji has got our full support. He\u2019s an absolute club legend and we think he\u2019s a great coach. We absolutely want him here for the long term.\u201d Wests Tigers coach Benji Marshall has the full support of the Holman Barnes Group. Credit: Getty Images AP: ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys said he is concerned about what had transpired at board level and that he wanted the NRL to investigate. Are you concerned that head office is concerned?\n\nDP: \u201cI think because it\u2019s a purely governance issue between the boards \u2013 and there is a current agreement in place with Holman Barnes Group and Wests Tigers \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that NRL should be concerned over this.\u201d AP: Should they be concerned about the performance of Wests Tigers because obviously the two are tied together? DP: \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re progressing in the right direction. So I think if the NRL looks at on-field performance as well as financial performance, then we should be heading towards the finals.\u201d AP: Is there still tension between Balmain and Western Suburbs, the two factions in the joint venture marriage? DP: \u201cIn the past, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of tension between Wests and Balmain. We\u2019ve had the Balmain board meet with the Wests Ashfield board, and what\u2019s been great is that I feel like we\u2019re more unified than ever. For example, Wests Ashfield has made it clear to Balmain that we want them to be part of the joint venture.\n\n\u201cThey retain their 10 per cent share in West Tigers, they retain their board seat in Wests Tigers. Wests Ashfield will continue to fund the Balmain Football Club and is now funding the Balmain District Juniors. So we\u2019re very much committed to supporting Balmain and continuing on in the joint venture.\u201d AP: At some clubs, it\u2019s pretty easy for the membership, if they are disgruntled, to affect change. For instance, at Canterbury, you only need to get about 110 signatures to force an extraordinary general meeting. Under the ownership structure with the Holman Barnes Group, and its relationship with Wests Tigers, there\u2019s basically no lever to pull if you\u2019re a disgruntled member or a fan. You need to be a debenture holder, and it\u2019s all very tightly controlled. Can you understand their frustration in that they are seeing this [boardroom brawl], they are seeing a lack of performance on the field, and there is nothing they can do about it? DP: \u201cAbsolutely, I can see the frustration \u2026 I\u2019m a fan myself, but we are progressing in the right direction. With the right people in place at the football department, I think we will progress and continue to progress. On-field performance is everything, and that\u2019s what we need to focus on.\u201d The long-term future of Tigers playmaker Jarome Luai remains unresolved. Credit: Getty Images AP: Speaking of things on the field, two of your highest profile players, Jarome Luai and Jahream Bula, have yet to commit long term. They have clauses or options in their contracts in their favour, and it was suggested they were close to committing \u2013 until the latest developments. Are you concerned that they might slip through your fingers because of what\u2019s transpired?\n\nDP: \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the football department. I haven\u2019t seen the contracts, so I\u2019m not aware of the clauses that we\u2019re talking about. However, I do believe that they\u2019re close to re-signing, and I\u2019d like to think they would.\u201d AP: A protest march has been arranged. Are you concerned about disgruntled Wests Tigers fans making their presence felt and making their voices heard?

So we support all our teams.\u201d AP: Will the Holman Barnes Group now start sticking their beak into football, interfering and meddling in football matters? DP: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not for the Holman Barnes Group to get involved with football operations and player signings. But it is their responsibility to ensure that due diligence is done correctly around the selection of those players. So it\u2019s just ensuring that governance and those systematic measures are in place.\u201d",

Silver called for the government to cease funding programs that provide musical instruments and doctors for high schools, and reduce the Better Boating Fund, all of which were rejected. However, it agreed to end a paid special leave program for health workers with COVID-19, in place since the pandemic. Targeted reviews of TAFE were recommended, but the government only committed to support this on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe Independent Review of the Victorian Public Service, which was commissioned by Treasurer Jaclyn Symes in February shortly after she moved into the job, urged the government to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d to reduce the sprawling growth of public sector entities since the pandemic. \u201cThere are good reasons for establishing entities to achieve a policy goal at a particular point in time, and they employ many talented and dedicated staff,\u201d the Silver review found. Loading \u201cHowever, the large and growing number of public entities and their complexity are creating duplication and confusion, and stifling public and private sector productivity.\u201d The report found that the substantial direct and indirect cost to the government of maintaining these entities and an extraordinary 3200 public boards and committees \u2013 a number greater than any other state or territory \u2013 undermined efforts to reduce public spending.\n\nSymes said the measures adopted by the government would make the public sector more efficient while avoiding frontline job cuts. \u201cFrontline workers are excluded from the scope of this review,\u201d she said. \u201cBringing together entities with similar functions makes it quicker and easier for individuals and businesses to interact with government by offering cleaner points of contact and fewer processes and forms to deal with.\u201d Symes said she accepted Silver\u2019s analysis that Victoria\u2019s large number of entities, and their complexities, could be confusing and put a handbrake on public and private productivity. \u201cNot only is it tying up some bureaucrats\u2019 time, it\u2019s creating numerous doors of entry for citizens, stakeholders and businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cTime is money. I hear this when I\u2019m out there talking to the business community.\u201d\n\nSymes said the public service had too many executive positions and not enough graduate and entry-level roles. She would not be drawn on how the savings would affect her operating surplus for this financial year. An updated figure for this will be reported on Friday as part of the state\u2019s mid-year budget update. The full recommendations of the Silver review, which were presented to the government in July, would have netted budget savings of about $5 billion. Opposition Leader Jess Wilson said the review was an admission of failure, accusing the government of mismanagement and a top-heavy bureaucracy that was driving debt. \u201cThis report issues a stark warning over the dire impact Victoria\u2019s soon to be $1 million an hour interest bill is having on our capacity to deliver frontline services now and into the future,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese supposed savings are a drop in the ocean. Since this report was handed to Labor in June, Victoria\u2019s net debt has grown by almost twice the claimed savings Labor\u2019s cuts will deliver. \u201cThe only ones cutting jobs and services are Premier Jacinta Allan and Treasurer Jaclyn Symes.\u201d Community and Public Sector Union state secretary Jiselle Hanna said it was good the treasurer had not embarked on bigger job cuts as first feared, but rejected the review\u2019s suggestion the government should be smaller. \u201cGovernment already cannot do what Victorians expect it to,\u201d she said. \u201cThe blind-faith obsession with outsourcing costs the state more by reducing our capability,\n\nincreasing long-term costs, and making budget repair harder.\u201d",

        "text": "Each station also has accessible toilets, parents\u2019 rooms and adult changing place facilities. A Travellers Aid hub at Parkville will open soon and help passengers get between the station and nearby hospitals. Stations could do with more seating, though. Good: Architecture and design The Arden station entrance features massive concrete arches lined with more than 100,000 hand-laid bricks, reflecting North Melbourne\u2019s rich industrial history. Credit: Justin McManus It\u2019s hard not to be impressed walking through the five new underground stations. High ceilings and wide platforms create a sense of space and openness that is a world away from their grubby City Loop counterparts.\n\nArden station\u2019s redbrick arches will surely become one of the city\u2019s architectural landmarks. The coupling of raw cement \u2013 most impressively in State Library station\u2019s arched entrance \u2013 with Art Deco-inspired lighting and fixtures reflects the city above it. It feels undeniably Melbourne. Signage is clear, and the connections between CBD interchange stations are intuitive to follow. There are escalators galore \u2013 including a wall of five at the State Library entrance \u2013 to avoid the passenger congestion experienced at other CBD stations, and provide redundancy during breakdowns (looking at you, Southern Cross).\n\nBad: Deja vu The quiet State Library station on Monday morning. Credit: Justin McManus The platforms at Town Hall and State Library look nearly identical \u2013 especially on board an arriving train. And because not every cement column on the platform is signed, it might not be obvious which station you are arriving at. Making the two stations distinct was a missed opportunity to explore different design ideas while making life easier for commuters.\n\nGood and bad: Anzac tram interchange The canopy at Anzac isn\u2019t up to the job. Credit: Wayne Taylor Anzac station\u2019s integrated tram stop works excellently. Transferring from St Kilda Road trams and directly down into the station takes just a couple of minutes. For many, getting on a train here will be quicker than taking a tram all the way up Swanston Street. It doesn\u2019t all work well, though. The 85-metre wooden canopy at Anzac is an attractive structure \u2013 but too small to protect passengers from the elements while transferring to/from a tram. It also fails to stop rain falling onto Anzac\u2019s concourse. Staff had to erect \u201cwet floor\u201d signs there during light rain on Monday.\n\nGood: Platform screen doors Platform screen doors improve safety and comfort. Credit: Simon Schluter Platform screen doors at each of the five stations are a big step up for passenger comfort. There\u2019s no loud whoosh of air as trains arrive or depart. They make platforms safer, quieter and easier to keep warm and cool. One nifty feature: the displays showing passenger loads in each carriage on the next arriving train, so you can board at a door with the most room. Not all doors are in use right now, however, and this could be signed better. Metro is operating seven-carriage trains in the Metro Tunnel, but the platforms are long enough to accommodate 10-carriage trains in the future. Doors not in use have signs that say \u201cBoard trains this way \u2192\u201d but The Age saw plenty of passengers expecting trains to arrive there, perhaps thinking the sign indicated the direction of travel.\n\nGood: Artwork Danie Mellor\u2019s work Forever at State Library station. Credit: Wayne Taylor Future generations of Melburnians will be grateful for the public artworks included at the new stations. Patricia Piccinini\u2019s colourful ceramic tiles at Parkville seem to be a favourite among visitors. Danie Mellor\u2019s work Forever, consisting of photographic portraits of Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung women printed on huge glass panels along La Trobe Street, is a beautiful addition to the city.\n\nBad: Advertising onslaught The unfinished digital advertising screen at Town Hall station. Credit: Gemma Grant When taking the escalators from the new City Square down into Town Hall station, passengers come face-to-face with a large wall crying out for another mural or artwork. Instead, an enormous LCD screen \u2013 we\u2019re talking IMAX here \u2013 will assault commuters with \u201cimmersive 3D anamorphic display\u201d advertising. A three-screen digital wrap-around also detracts from the State Library station\u2019s impressive entrance.\n\nThe stations were supposed to celebrate Melbourne\u2019s history and people. Too many of them have fallen victim to the rapacious commercialisation of public life. The wraparound advertising screens at State Library. Credit: Wayne Taylor Bad: Fast food The use of retail space is uninspired. There\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s at Town Hall, while Parkville has a Maccas and a KFC. The doctors at the Royal Melbourne and Peter Mac won\u2019t love that patients have access to so much junk food on their doorstep. The iconic Campbell Arcade is now accessible from Town Hall. It was home to an independent coffee shop, a record store and the Sticky Institute zine hub before it was emptied during construction. Let\u2019s hope it rekindles that quirky and creative spirit when the shopfronts are leased out again.\n\nBad: CBD station myki glitch The underground concourse connecting State Library station to Melbourne Central. Credit: Jason South Town Hall station connects to Flinders Street Station. State Library connects to Melbourne Central. Passengers can transfer between them without going through myki gates \u2013 in effect, forming two CBD mega stations served by both the Metro Tunnel and City Loop. But the myki ticket system treats them as separate stations.\n\nLoading Usually, if you enter a station, change your mind about travelling and exit the same station within 15 minutes, you are not be charged a fare. But if you enter Town Hall, change your mind and then exit via the Melbourne Central gates, your myki will be charged. Transport Victoria says it is working to change this, and also make it possible for anyone to use these underpasses without touching on. Until then, one gate is left open at Town Hall and State Library.\n\nBad: Bicycle parking The absence of secure or even undercover bicycle parking at Arden, Parkville or Anzac is a baffling oversight. There are bicycle hoops, all vulnerable to the elements and thieves. Loading Good bicycle parking can encourage commuters to combine a short bike ride with a train journey, massively enhancing the catchment of people who can access a station. The Dutch, of course, do this best: at Utrecht station, commuters can ride directly into its three-level, 12,500-bike underground parking facility. That might be overkill for Melbourne. But the Metro Tunnel stations don\u2019t even have the lockable Parkiteer bike cages, which are installed at many suburban stations.\n\nGood and bad: Public space The revamped City Square, above Town Hall station, is a welcome addition to a CBD that is starved of communal space. It\u2019s a shame that other opportunities to create new public spaces were missed. The project initially planned to permanently close Franklin Street (between City Baths and RMIT) to create a new pedestrian zone and public space, but that was scrapped. The redeveloped City Square. Credit: Joe Armao The Swanston Street vehicle-free zone should have been extended north to A\u2019Beckett Street, past State Library station.\n\nLikewise, one or both sides of Flinders Street were closed for years during construction. People have gotten used to it. It could have stayed closed to make room for the tens of thousands of pedestrians set to pour out of Town Hall and Flinders every morning. Instead, they\u2019ll have to squeeze onto already overcrowded footpaths when it reverts to a traffic thoroughfare. Bad: Soft launch timetable Almost every Melburnian will be aware that the Metro Tunnel is now open. But how many will have read the fine print? It is only open between 10am to 3pm on weekdays, and until 7pm on weekends. Trains run only every 20 minutes. The full timetable starts on February 1.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that some people will leave home thinking they can get a train to Parkville, only to find the tunnel is closed for the day. Visitors here for the Australian Open and other events this summer will be confused too. Bad: The line with no name In New York you can get on the \u201cA\u201d train to Harlem. Londoners ride the Jubilee and Suffragette lines. Metro Tunnel will operate the newly connected Sunbury and Cranbourne/Pakenham lines. Passenger information displays at Anzac. Credit: Wayne Taylor\n\nNot just a mouthful, it can be confusing, too. Melbourne\u2019s train lines are named after their final terminus (the Hurstbridge Line, the Glen Waverley Line). That\u2019s fine if they only travel into the CBD and back again to their origin. It doesn\u2019t work for the 100 kilometre end-to-end Metro Tunnel. As it stands, Pakenham Line trains go to Sunbury, and Sunbury Line trains go to Cranbourne or East Pakenham. If they applied the convention used on the London Underground, customers would be told they need a \u201cMetro Line: Sunbury\u201d train to travel towards Sunbury. Much easier to understand.\n\nGood: Cross-city travel People say the Yarra is the physical and psychological barrier that divides Melbourne. I\u2019d argue the City Loop is just as significant. The Metro Tunnel bridges the divide, making it possible to travel directly from the outer north-west all the way to the outer south-east. Over time, this will change how Melburnians conceive the city and their place in it. People will be more willing and able to cross the city for work, study or leisure. Melbourne will be a smaller, more connected place.",

Swan was as gloriously irreverent as Spike. He mentioned his family and kids but added they didn\u2019t deserve any thanks because they weren\u2019t around when he played. Besides, he loves them, \u201cbut I don\u2019t necessarily like them all the time\u201d. He thanked his teammates, but \u201cthey rode on my coat-tails, so I probably don\u2019t need to thank them\u201d.\n\nSwan is the most disarmingly entertaining after-dinner speaker and interviewee in football. Self-deprecating and dry, he thanked the fans for their support, \u201calthough there are no fans here, we all know it\u2019s just rich people and players\u201d in the room. The rich people and players guffawed loudly. \u201cThe love I received from the fans, and I guess as a \u2018Rat Pack\u2019 we did, clearly you made me bigger than what I was or what I am. So I thank you for that,\u201d he said. Dane Swan and Alan Didak celebrate the club\u2019s 2010 premiership. Credit: Joe Armao And this is the nub of Swan. An outrageously good footballer in his peak years after 2007 or 2008 until his retirement, he was just outrageous in his early years. He described himself as a kid who was as surprised as anyone to find himself on an AFL list.\n\nLoading \u201cI got dropped halfway through the year I got drafted for having a poor attitude which may shock some people, then I played three good games, and they drafted me off the back of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a got some wonderful memories from those first four years [in the AFL] but none of them have got anything to do with football. They are all hazy now \u2013 I was pretty good off the field. \u201cObviously, the best thing that happened to me in the AFL was \u2013 and it\u2019s not for everyone, but it obviously worked for me \u2013 I went out and got arrested.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s probably not for everyone.\n\nBut for Swan, it was the moment that prompted a new career-saving commitment. At a time when the club was bottoming out and playing kids he was given another chance. Had it not been for his arrest on assault charges in 2003 and changing his ways, he \u201cwould have been given the arse at the end of the year and that would have been it\u201d. \u201cI got 50 games I didn\u2019t deserve. Mick [Malthouse] was extremely hard on me; in those team meetings he used to say some pretty mean stuff and say some personal stuff I didn\u2019t even know about myself. I thought, \u2018Someone is going to have to tell my parents, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened here\u2019.\u201d \u201cObviously, the best thing that happened to me in the AFL was \u2013 and it\u2019s not for everyone, but it obviously worked for me \u2013 I went out and got arrested.\u201d Dane Swan The club didn\u2019t need to be bullied to include Swan in their Hall of Fame. His Brownlow Medal, his premiership, and his powerful indefatigable run and nous to find the goals had already made certain of his inclusion. It was not hyperbole for Matthews to say he was in the conversation as the best player in the competition at one stage. For a period of four or five years, he was clearly among the best in the AFL. But playing ability and achievements were only part of the reason, and in fact the lesser of the reasons, for the warmth with which Swan is held at the club. Swan was the everyman who played unlike the everyman. He was tattooed \u2013 he said that helped his mystique \u2013 and was not so wound up in the self-importance of the AFL as to be unable to laugh at it, and himself.\n\nHis most telling comment was that he never wanted to be the best footballer he could be, he wanted to have the best life he could have. He understood work-life balance in football before it was a thing. He commanded play with the ball and was ringmaster away from the field. He led a group of similarly talented players \u2013 Alan Didak, Ben Johnson, Chris Tarrant \u2013 who shared a thirst for life after hours. \u201cI hope one day the Rat Pack get put in here as a group,\u201d he said, to loud laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing but I\u2019m serious. \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t on the Men For All Seasons calendars, I wasn\u2019t built like that. We\u2019re just normal everyday guys who just happened to play on the MCG, we\u2019re out doing whatever else is doing.\u201d\n\nThis relatability is the reason he can upstage even Matthews, a football icon who has homes everywhere and nowhere, having been the player of the century at Hawthorn, coached flags at Collingwood and against them at the Brisbane Lions, but loves them all in different ways. Collingwood were the perfect fit for Swan. Dane Swan was a footy character who was beloved by the fans. Credit: Getty Images This is a club of Tony Shaw and Lou Richards. A club where a member of the original Magpie Rat Pack now runs the club. Before Swan, Didak, Johnson and Shaw, there was Craig Kelly, Denis Banks, Mick McGuane and, of course, Darren Millane. Kelly is now the CEO. The club embraced their past this night opening a new Hall of Fame section in the rebuilt museum. It includes Millane\u2019s locker from the Victoria Park change rooms. It\u2019s sparseness, sitting alone in the room, adds to the poignancy of recognising the premiership player who died in a car accident in his prime.",

        "text": "The International Monetary Fund has estimated that Ukraine will have a \u20ac65 billion shortfall in its budget over the next two years without financial aid. About two-thirds of Ukraine\u2019s government revenues are now devoted to the war effort. It desperately needs more cash. Loading A stumbling block to a EU plan to use the Russian assets as collateral for a \u20ac140 billion loan to Ukraine has been Belgium\u2019s unwillingness to expose itself to Russian litigation if there is a peace deal, sanctions on Russia are lifted and Moscow demands the return of its money, which Euroclear would have a contractual obligation to comply with. That could leave Belgium on the hook for the funds, and facing insolvency. Russia has, indeed, threatened 50 years of legal warfare against Europe if its assets are touched. It would also probably seize Western financial assets (the amounts aren\u2019t known) that it froze in retaliation for the G-7 sanctions. The latest EU proposal would involve Euroclear making an interest-free loan equivalent to the value of the Russian assets it holds, which would be used to repay EU countries for money already lent to Ukraine, with the rest lent to Kyiv.\n\nUkraine wouldn\u2019t be required to repay the loan unless and until it received compensation \u2013 reparations \u2013 from Moscow for the damage the war has done to its infrastructure and people. The cost of remediating the damage that the war has inflicted on Ukraine has been estimated at close to the equivalent of a trillion Australian dollars. An option that has been considered in response to Belgium\u2019s concerns is that some or all of the EU member states provide guarantees that they would underwrite the repayment of the \u201creparations\u201d loan should Russia refuse to pay for the damage it has done. Alternatively, the EU could just borrow the money itself and lend it to Ukraine, hoping that repayment would be secured in future peace negotiations.\n\nWhile a loan to Ukraine, whether backed by Russia\u2019s assets or not, would give the Europeans a direct stake in the outcome of the peace negotiations being undertaken by the US (with minimal involvement by Ukraine), it could also place the guarantor nations at financial risk if the US forces Ukraine into a deal on Russia\u2019s terms. Loading That could happen. Under the 28-point plan that the US presented to Russia last month (with, it seems, considerable input from the Russians), apart from ceding Ukrainian land that Russia doesn\u2019t currently control along with that it does occupy, an exclusion from Ukraine joining NATO and reducing the size of its military, all sanctions on Russia would be lifted. The agreement specifically said that frozen Russian funds would be used in US-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine, with the US receiving 50 per cent of any profits. The EU would contribute $US100 billion ($150 billion) to the reconstruction funding. The rest of the frozen funds would be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle for joint projects. While the Russians rejected the proposals, the Trump administration has made it clear that it views the ending of the war as a commercial opportunity (surprise, surprise) and is less concerned about Ukraine\u2019s interests \u2013 and those of the Europeans \u2013 than it is in its own and in Donald Trump\u2019s desire to have his name on a peace deal, regardless of its quality.\n\nIf Ukraine\u2019s interests are to be protected, it will be by the EU, not America. That the bulk of Russia\u2019s offshore reserves are held within Europe does give the EU leverage to participate in any settlement, though it is extremely difficult, indeed near-impossible, to obtain a consensus from with a 27-member bloc that contains some pro-Russian voices. If the EU can agree on a mechanism for funnelling, directly or indirectly, the value of the Russian assets held within Europe to Ukraine, it would give it a place at the table because it would signal to Russia that Ukraine would have the money to sustain its defence for at least the next two years. Russia might have had some successes on the ground in Ukraine, at considerable cost in lives and equipment, but the war is taking an increasingly severe toll on its own economy, which is in the grip of stagflation, on the brink of recession and where the government\u2019s focus on military spending is causing significant economic stresses in regions not benefiting from the war effort. A recent tightening of US sanctions on Russia oil exports, targeting both Russia\u2019s major oil producers and, critically, their customers, will cut further and harder into Moscow\u2019s revenues and its ability to fund the war without risking more domestic economic hardship and social unrest.",

But this year\u2019s Wrapped, released on Thursday, has offered something new that\u2019s confused everyone: your Spotify listening age.\n\nSpotify Wrapped\u2019s listening age is such a lie.\n\nAccording to the streamer, your listening age is based on the idea of a \u201creminiscence bump\u201d, which they define as \u201cthe tendency to feel most connected to the music from your younger years\u201d.\n\n\u201cFirst, we look at the release dates of all the songs you played this year. Next, we identify the five-year span of music that you engaged with more than other listeners your age. We\u2019re hypothesising that this five-year span matches your \u2018reminiscence bump\u2019, assuming you were between 16 and 21 years old when those tracks were released,\u201d Spotify said in a statement.",

        "text": "A hatchet will be taken to a \"top-heavy\" state public service but job cuts won't be as deep as foreshadowed.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan and Treasurer Jaclyn Symes on Thursday released a long-awaited independent review of Victoria's public service, led by banking executive and former bureaucrat Helen Silver.\n\nThe Victorian government's response committed to reducing the public service workforce by more than 1000 full-time equivalent jobs, including cutting 332 senior executive and technical specialist roles.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTwenty-nine government entities will be merged or abolished entirely in the shake-up, alongside cutting back on spending on consultants, labour hire and CBD office space.\n\nTreasury estimates the measures will save Victoria's under-pressure budget more than $4 billion over the next four years.\n\nMs Silver's review contained more than $5 billion in suggested savings, recommending reductions of 2068 jobs, 78 entities and as many as 90 advisory bodies.\n\nThe government's pared-back moves will end unnecessary duplication and rebalance the state's \"top-heavy\" public service, the premier said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"We've rejected those recommendations that go to areas of frontline services,\" she told reporters.\n\nMs Symes admitted to an error on the government's media release that pointed to $427 million in estimated savings from entity mergers, when the actual figure was $27 million.\n\nTreasurer Jaclyn Symes is \"absolutely conscious\" the job cuts are landing 20 days before Christmas. (Diego Fedele/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe review found Victoria's public service workforce has grown 16 per cent since 2019, with the number of executive positions up 52 per cent.\n\nHigher-level public service staff, known as VPS5 and VPS6, will be capped at 15 per cent, saving $125 million over four years.\n\n\"We have a situation where we have too many executives, too many in the top of the range and not enough entry-level and graduate positions,\" Ms Symes said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen announcing the review in February, Ms Symes said it would aim at job losses between 2000 and 3000 - about five to six per cent of the public service workforce.\n\nThe treasurer said she was \"absolutely conscious\" news of the looming job cuts was landing 20 days before Christmas but insisted it wasn't a termination notification.\n\n\"Many of these positions will be removed and altered, and changed by attrition,\" Ms Symes said.\n\n\"That is what has been baked into the $4 billion in savings. We would lose a lot of those savings if we were to pay out redundancies tomorrow.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVictoria's Community and Public Sector Union claimed victory over the smaller job cut number and suggested most of the pain was behind the 55,000-strong workforce.\n\n\"Six hundred and nineteen of the 1055 jobs to go have already been implemented,\" the union's Victorian branch assistant secretary Mitch Vandewerdt-Holman said.\n\n\"We've been fighting every single one of those cuts. We will continue to fight to save as many jobs as possible.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Jess Wilson described the review as a \"$4 billion admission of failure\".\n\n\"These supposed savings are a drop in the ocean,\" the Liberal leader and shadow treasurer said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Since this report was handed to Labor in June, Victoria's net debt has grown by almost twice the claimed savings Labor's cuts will deliver.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Jess Wilson has described the review into Victoria's public service as a failure. (Joel Carrett/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe state of Victoria's finances are expected to be a major election battleground for the November 2026 election.\n\nMs Symes' predecessor Tim Pallas sought to cut 3000 to 4000 public service jobs in the 2023/24 Victorian budget.\n\nInstead, employee numbers grew from 54,760 to 54,839 over the financial year and the total wage bill was forecast to rise from $38 billion in 2024/25 and $42.4 billion in 2028/29.\n\nVictoria's net debt is expected to reach $194 billion by mid-2029, sending interest repayments soaring close to $29 million a day.\n\nProjections on government spending and debt will be refreshed on Friday when the mid-year budget update is released.",
