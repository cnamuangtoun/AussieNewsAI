Beyond its namesake television and motion picture division, Warner owns HBO Max and DC Studios. And Netflix has risen to dominance as a household name ubiquitous to on-demand content, while building its own production arm to release popular titles like Stranger Things and Squid Game .\n\nThe cash and stock deal is valued at $US27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of approximately $US82.7 billion ($124.55 billion). The transaction is expected to close after Warner separates its Discovery Global cable operations into a new publicly-traded company in the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThis image released by Warner Bros Pictures shows Leonardo DiCaprio in a scene from One Battle After Another. (AP)\n\nShares of Warner Bros rose nearly 3 per cent in premarket trading while shares of Netflix and Paramount fell more than 2 per cent.\n\nGaining Warner's legacy studios would mark a notable shift for Netflix's current movie theatre footprint. Under the proposed acquisition Netflix has promised to continue theatrical releases for Warner's studio films \u2014 honouring Warner's contractual agreements for movie releases.\n\nNetflix has kept most of its original content within its core online platform. But there have been a few exceptions, such as limited theatre screenings of a KPop Demon Hunters sing-a-long and its coming Stranger Things series finale.\n\nAs recently as October \u2014 when Warner signalled that it was open to a potential sale of its business \u2014 Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated on an earnings call that the company had been \"very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks\" and that there was \"no change there\".\n\n\"We believe that we can be and we will be choosy,\" Sarandos said at the time, without fully ruling out a potential bid for Warner.\n\nREAD MORE: Tributes to woman killed by her own dog in South Australian home \ufeff\n\nNetflix has struck a deal with Warner Bros Discovery to buy the legacy Hollywood giant's studio and streaming business for $US72 billion ($108 billion).

(Nine)\n\nAustralians are paying more for private health insurance and getting less for their money in return, a new report from the country's top doctors' advocacy group says. (Getty)\n\nThe report card showed that every year since 2008, the growth of private health insurance premiums has outstripped inflation, health sector inflation, average weekly earnings and the indexation of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).\n\nBetween 2008 and 2024, premiums climbed more than 100 per cent, while MBS indexation \u2013 which was frozen for several years from 2013 \u2013 increased by less than 20 per cent.\n\nThe report card also shows that over the six years to June 2025, insurers increased benefits paid for in-hospital medical treatment by only 18.1 per cent, while sector profits grew by nearly 50 per cent over the same period.\n\nREAD MORE: Manhunt for prisoner who escaped from police at hospital \ufeff\n\nIn 2024-2025, insurers returned 84.2 per cent of premiums to consumers as benefits, below the 2019 level of 88 per cent.\n\nThe AMA is calling on the federal government to mandate a 90 per cent return minimum for insurers.\n\n\"Of course, private health insurers must make a surplus to be sustainable, but it is clear they are holding out on Australians while recording significant profits each year,\" McMullen said.\n\nThe AMA is calling for major reform.

There are too many bodies involved in the regulation of private health \u2013 a single, independent authority would provide a unified and coherent approach.\"",

        "text": "An interest rate hike on Tuesday is a practical impossibility.\n\nBut if a growing number of forecasters are proved correct, it's a moot point, because one or more are on the way.\n\nThe reason is that Australia's inflation problem has not gone away and, by some measurements, is worsening.\n\nTwo official economic reports this week \u2014 the national accounts and the monthly household spending indicator \u2014 highlighted the key problem facing policymakers: too much money is chasing too few goods.\n\nUp to now, nobody's figured out how to solve this problem.\n\nUntil it's solved, millions of mortgage borrowers will continue to pay the price.\n\nA story RBA may not want to hear\n\nInflation fighters copped a one-two punch this week and both hits stung.\n\nThe national accounts for the September quarter, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), showed the economy on a reasonably solid footing.\n\nAustralia's gross domestic product grew by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, following growth of 0.7 per cent in the June quarter.\n\nGDP's sting in the tail Australia's latest economic growth numbers show an economy in generally rude health, but that might result in a rude shock for mortgage borrowers earlier rather than later in 2026.\n\nEssential household spending was up 1 per cent, driven by payments for banking and superannuation services, electricity and health.\n\nPublic investment grew by 3 per cent in the September quarter, rebounding from a 3.5 per cent fall in the June quarter.\n\nA day later, the second punch came.\n\nThe ABS media release headline seemingly toying with the Reserve Bank: \"Strong growth in goods lifts household spending\".\n\n\"Discretionary spending surged this month led by goods as promotional events saw households spend more on clothing, footwear, furnishings and electronics following months of weaker spending in these categories,\" ABS head of business statistics Tom Lay said.\n\nMillions of Australians clearly have money to spend.\n\nWhere from, you ask? Higher wages and investments income.\n\n\"The strong rise in gross disposable income was driven by COE [Compensation of Employees],\" the ABS noted.\n\n\" Superannuation investment income also contributed to the rise, reflecting a strong performance in the domestic share market. \"\n\nThe upshot of all this for the Reserve Bank is that there may be too much demand in the economy.\n\nAustralians are going shopping with the extra money in their pockets. (Pexels: Ron Lach)\n\nAn economy overwhelmed breeds inflation\n\nWhen it rains too much, dams overflow.\n\nWhen demand exceeds the capacity of an economy to meet it with supply, inflation rises.\n\nIndependent economist Chris Richardson has the hard numbers \u2014 extracted from the national accounts \u2014 to back this up.\n\nHe points out that although national production, or overall supply, lifted 2.1 per cent in the three months to September, demand rose 2.6 per cent.\n\n\"Worse still,\" he adds, \"that 2.6 per cent was probably 2.8 per cent\" because the ABS just announced it had to guess the speed of the rise in illegal tobacco.\n\n\"So, although our growth rate is disappointing, it is probably in line with what we're set to achieve over the longer term,\" he said.\n\nIt means \"our dollar desires are pressing on the accelerator even though the clapped-out engine of the Australian economy is doing the best it can\".\n\n\"That gap \u2014 too much money chasing too little stuff \u2014 is part of why price pressures are lingering,\" he said.\n\nThe solution? Productivity\n\nThe solution is to raise productivity, but it's happening at a snail's pace.\n\nQuarterly growth in productivity has been oscillating between -0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent for about 18 months.\n\nIn the three months to September this year it was 0.2 per cent.\n\nThe annual pace of productivity, however, lifted to slightly above the assumed rate of productivity the Reserve Bank uses in its forecasts.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut, given the pace of demand appears to be increasing on the back of higher wages and investment incomes, productivity will also likely need to lift.\n\nOne positive development taken from the national accounts is the notable investment in data centres by business.\n\n\"This is likely due to firms looking to support growth in artificial intelligence and cloud computing capabilities,\" ABS head of National Account Grace Kim said.\n\nThis is a tangible example of a type of economic expansion.\n\nAnd the ABS also noted real unit labour costs were -0.1 per cent in September quarter, which means each worker is now, on average, costing \u2014 a slightly more productive firm \u2014 less.\n\nThis reduces the pressure on business to pass costs onto customers.\n\nMultiple rate hikes could be coming\n\nBut there is an inescapable fact: the economy, though only growing modestly, is buckling under the pressure.\n\nIt means demand needs to fall.\n\nYou could crash the property and stock markets, but few would agree to that.\n\nAnd you can forget further hurting young renters by footing a higher cost of living.\n\nThat, rightly or wrongly, leaves mortgage borrowers to foot the bill for the productivity shortfall.\n\nAnd they're now staring down the barrel of not just one, but potentially several interest rate hikes in 2026.\n\nThe state of the economy leaves RBA Governor Michele Bullock and her board with a narrow path forward. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\n\"In our assessment, the detail of the data showed a much healthier consumer, hot housing market and elevated unit labour costs,\" investment firm Barrenjoey wrote in a note.\n\n\" We continue to expect rate hikes in May and August 2026. \"\n\nInternational bank HSBC is also onboard the multi-hike train.\n\n\"Growth is on an upswing, and, in our view, the economy is already operating at, or beyond, its 'speed limit',\" chief economist Paul Bloxham wrote.\n\nRate hike could be here within months Hotter-than-expected inflation figures have caught many off guard and open the door for an RBA interest rate hike in 2026.\n\n\"We retain our view that the easing phase is done and shift our own central case to pencilling in hikes to begin from Q3 2026 (from Q1 2027 previously).\"\n\nNote the plural \"hikes\" used by Bloxham.\n\nHSBC is also flirting with the idea of factoring in an RBA interest rate hike even sooner in the New Year, perhaps as early as February.\n\nMarket meltdown\n\nWhat's also noteworthy is most, if not all, economists have placed a caveat on their interest rate hike predictions, warning of, as Paul Bloxham phrases it, \"a negative global shock\".\n\nNext week, the Federal Reserve meets and hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of investment funds are betting on an interest rate cut.\n\nYou wouldn't want to be caught wrong-footed during next week's press conference.\n\nAt the same time Japanese interest rates are becoming more attractive by the hour to offshore investors \u2014 perhaps those without nerves of steel betting on American exceptionalism.\n\nThe economic year could be set to finish off with a bang.",

(ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)\n\nThe ERDC Act states that proceedings before the court must be heard in public.\n\nBut it also states that the court, where it considers reasons to be \"sufficient\", can give directions to exclude any person from a hearing, or require that that it be held in private, or prohibit or restrict the publication of evidence \u2014 or contents of any document \u2014 given to the court.\n\n\"Unless I am missing something, the whole system is at odds with itself.

(Supplied: Geoff Schrader)\n\nHe said the biggest problem with the proposal was car parking and how it would work when the building's access point will be Considine Place \u2014 a narrow laneway off Gilbert Street.\n\n\"It's how people get out of Christie Walk, and if there's a queue of cars trying to get into their car parks at the end of the day, or beginning of the day, that will be problematic,\" Mr Schrader said.\n\nHe said the lane also supported foot traffic from people heading to and from homeless shelters in and around Whitmore Square.\n\n\" The other issues are the fact it's kind of higher than the current height allowance for this portion of Gilbert Street, and it overlooks a childcare centre, so there are issues around child safety and so forth. \"\n\nThe five-storey mixed-used building, if approved, will abut this childcare centre. (ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)\n\nThe compromised proposal was presented to CAP at its January 29 2025 meeting, where it decided to grant planning consent.\n\nThe building height had been reduced to five levels, car parking spaces reduced from 28 to 19, and the set-back between the first and fourth levels and the northern boundary increased from 1 metre to more than 5m.\n\nAt ground level, however, from where the car stacker is believed to be located, it will be only a metre from Christie Walk buildings.\n\nSystem 'allows for transparency'\n\nA state government spokesperson said it was a matter for Adelaide City Council to communicate with \"their residents about the decision they came to with the developer in the ERDC\".\n\n\"The system allows for transparency, with publicly available documents uploaded to Plan SA at all times throughout the process per the legislative and policy frameworks,\" he said.\n\n\"Details of matters to be heard in the ERDC are publicly available through the case lists published daily on the Courts Administration Authority website.\"\n\nThe Christie Walk ecocity development was finished in December 2006. (ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)\n\nMr Brady warned that a system that excluded third parties from appeal processes could be taken advantage of by developers.\n\n\"They know that the legislation is there, and indeed, everything that's been done so far here is due process and legal, but so what?\" he said.\n\n\"I could be sitting here on my balcony and at the end of next year all of a sudden Whelan the Wrecker rolls in with a big ball, knocks the building down, and we're going, 'What?\"",

(Supplied: NGA)\n\nNow the Girramay/Yidinji/Kuku-Yalanji man is one of the country's foremost contemporary artists and the artistic director of the latest triennial, which opens today at the NGA.\n\nAlbert's triennial is called After the Rain and reflects on matters of legacy as well as rebirth and renewal; on what rain washes away and what grows in its wake.\n\nThis is also the first artist-led iteration of the blockbuster exhibition.\n\n\"That's not symbolic; it's structural.

This allows artists to realise what may be their most seminal works of their career,\" Albert says.\n\nOne powerful example of this can be found in the immersive installation by Alair Pambegan, a Wik-Mungkan man from Aurukun and a cultural custodian of the flying fox story.\n\nHis own father had been part of that first triennial in 2007, and \"featured as one of the 'big guns' \u2014 the major artists in the exhibition\".\n\nWhen Albert invited Pambegan to take part in After the Rain he wrote a letter asking he make his \"most ambitious work to date\", both on a cultural and artistic level.\n\nPambegan rose to the challenge.\n\nHis work, Kalben-aw story place of Wuku and Mukam the flying fox brothers, features more than 600 cylindrical painted wooden carvings suspended from the ceiling, as well as two ceremonial sculptures representing the brothers and the never-before-shown origins of that story.\n\nPambegan first worked with Albert on his first solo exhibition, in Sydney in 2017. (Supplied: NGA)\n\nPambegan's reinterpretation of such an important story (one that is explicitly about the consequences of our actions) also signals to Albert how strongly the art world has elevated First Nations and contemporary Indigenous art.\n\n\"There was a point in time where that custodianship of the story was about replicating and keeping it alive, but now we're seeing innovation,\" Albert says.\n\nAn artist-led approach\n\nAs much as Albert has encouraged the featured artists to push themselves and their artistic boundaries, often he found the featured artists were leading the charge themselves.\n\n\"It seems like a silly thing to say, but it should be the direction and trajectory of this decolonising, Indigenising space,\" Albert says.\n\n\"Setting parameters was really interesting because I know artists will always have the right answer but I've been surprised every step of the way.\"\n\nAlbert knew from the start he wanted to include the work of Grace Kemarre Robinya from Tangentyere Art Centre, because he is \"in love with the simplistic nature of all that Gracie paints\".\n\nRobinya is the oldest artist featured in After the Rain, and the one whose work has the strongest visual connection to the cultural, environmental, social and political themes Albert wanted to explore and share.\n\nIn Robinya's 11-panel Kwatjala nhama timela (Raining time), the artist paints the rain: \"We love rain because if it don't come for a long, long time it isn't good,\" she says. (Supplied: NGA)\n\n\"When I look at [her] work, I'm compelled to think both holistically and metaphysically about what sits within a raindrop,\" he says.\n\n\"But if we go back to these conversations about pushing boundaries, about doing this seminal practice, I knew from my love with Gracie and my time and relationship I've had with her, I couldn't give her a four- or five-metre canvas to paint because that was never going to happen,\" Albert explains.\n\nTheir solution was to provide Robinya with a series of canvases that she could \"attack from every angle\".\n\nRobinya painted 11 before Albert got the call to say she was finished.\n\n\"And so by piecing all these canvases together, we get this incredible, monumental work from a very senior artist that epitomises to me the idea of what After the Rain means about being on Country and understanding Country,\" Albert says.\n\nSprouting new beginnings\n\nDespite the excitement of After the Rain there's one element of the National Indigenous Art Triennial that has been a longstanding point of contention \u2014 the exhibition has never been every three years until now.\n\nWarraba Weatherall, featured in the triennial, works to etch mortuary tables with patterns mirroring those in trees. (Supplied: NGA)\n\nAfter the Rain follows on from Culture Warriors in 2007, unDISCLOSED in 2012, Defying Empire in 2017 and Ceremony in 2022.\n\n\"That's something we [Blak arts professionals] are concerned about and we talk about as mob, like: 'What is this thing? What is the commitment that the National Gallery has to Indigenous art?'\" Albert says.\n\nHe hopes that as the first artist-led triennial, After the Rain has set parameters for the triennial's future and in doing so has also \"set the tone for our own sovereignty, our own autonomy\".\n\nNATSIAA winners announced Gaypalani Wa\u1e49ambi, Bulanjdjan Lucy Yarawanga, Owen Yalandja and Jahkarli Felicitas Romanis are among the winners at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards.\n\nLooking to his own art practice, Albert says his experience as After the Rain's artistic director has solidified his desire to be given the opportunity to be heard when working with institutions and blockbuster art shows.\n\n\"[I want] for someone to take what I want to do, my idea under my autonomy and make it the best possible for me,\" he says.\n\n\"That's what I did for the artists in After the Rain. And that's I think all we want as artists, for someone to lift us, to put the time, energy, and resources into making our dreams come true.\"\n\nThe 5th National Indigenous Art Triennial: After the Rain is at National Gallery of Australia until April 26.",

They were lauded as works of genius or reviled as self-indulgent messes.\n\nHis works were so fantastical that sometimes even he was not sure what he had wrought, as was the case with the Bilbao museum.\n\nThe Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain, has been hailed as one of the great works of modern architecture. (Reuters: Guillermo Martinez)\n\nIn 2010, a panel of experts put together by Vanity Fair cited it as the most important work of architecture since 1980.\n\nEminent architect Philip Johnson called it \"the greatest building of our time\" and Gehry \"the greatest architect we have\".\n\nHowever, Gehry himself said that \"it took a couple of years\" before he started to like it.\n\n\"I went there just before the opening and looked at it and said, 'Oh, my God, what have I done to these people?'\" Gehry said.\n\nMuseums, Facebook campus among works\n\nIn March 2015, Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, California, opened a massive expansion designed by Gehry, who was given instructions not to be so bold that the facility would not fit in with its surroundings.\n\nGehry also opened La Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris in 2014.\n\nLa Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris was inspired by the glasshouses that previously stood on the site. (Reuters: Charles Platiau)\n\nFrench billionaire Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, paid tribute to Gehry following his passing.\n\n\"Frank Gehry \u2014 who possessed an unparalleled gift for shaping forms, pleating glass like canvas, making it dance like a silhouette \u2014 will long endure as a living source of inspiration for Louis Vuitton,\" he said in a statement.\n\nFrank Gehry opens UTS building likened to 'paper bag' Architect Frank Gehry says the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney was inspired by renaissance artists' fascination with folds in skin and clothing.\n\nHis other notable buildings included the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Dancing House in Prague, the Experience Music Project in Seattle and the 8 Spruce residential tower in New York.\n\nGehry's critics accused him of disregarding function in favour of form.\n\nHis Disney concert hall was lambasted by various critics as \"a pile of broken crockery\", \"a fortune cookie gone berserk\", \"deconstructionist trash\" and \"an emptied waste basket\".\n\nHis first Australian design, the Dr Chau Chak Wing building at UTS in Sydney, was likened to a paper bag when it was opened in 2015.\n\nGehry tried to shrug off such criticism, telling The New Yorker in 2007, \"You kind of say, 'At least they're looking!'\"\n\nBut he was not always so sanguine. While in Spain in October 2014 to accept an award, Gehry was asked about criticism that his work was too showy.\n\nHe raised his middle finger and said: \"In this world we are living in, 98 per cent of everything that is built and designed today is pure shit. There's no sense of design, no respect for humanity or for anything else.\n\n\"They are damn buildings and that's it.\"\n\nThe Disney Concert Hall was labelled \"a fortune cookie gone berserk\" when the design was first revealed. (Reuters: Lucy Nicholson)\n\nA lifelong love of design\n\nBorn Ephraim Owen Goldberg in 1929 in Toronto, Canada, Gehry began designing buildings and miniature cities out of scraps of wood as a child.\n\n\"That's what I remembered, years later, when I was struggling to find out what I wanted to do in life,\" he told The New Yorker in 1977.\n\n\" It made me think about architecture. It also gave me the idea that an adult could play. \"\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California, Gehry went through a restless period.\n\nHe worked at a couple of Los Angeles architecture firms, began studies at the Harvard Graduate School of Design but quit without a degree, served a year in the US Army and moved to Paris for a year.\n\nBy the time he returned to Los Angeles in 1962, he had changed his last name to Gehry, at his wife's suggestion, as a way to avoid antisemitism.\n\nFrank Gehry's Santa Monica residence is a mainstay of Los Angeles architecture tours. (Supplied: Architectural Resources Group)\n\nHis breakthrough project was in 1978, when he rebuilt his own Santa Monica home \u2014 taking a pink traditional Dutch colonial house and turning it into something fantastical with common materials such as chain-link fencing, corrugated aluminium and unfinished plywood.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, he was attracting international attention with buildings sheathed in stainless steel or aluminium that seemed to bend and sway, subverting the conventions of architecture.\n\nIn 1989, he won the Pritzker Prize, his profession's most prestigious award.\n\nBut his masterpiece came when he was charged with designing the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, completed in 1997 using computer software that enabled him to build in increasingly eccentric shapes.\n\nGehry, who was married twice and had four children, also designed furniture, jewellery, watches, a bottle for a vodka distiller and a hat for singer Lady Gaga that looked like a tall, crumpled mass of silver fabric.\n\nReuters/ABC",

I almost crashed,\" Norris had been left exclaiming.\n\nFor Piastri, desperate for the pace he had in Qatar last weekend when only McLaren's strategy blunder stopped him sweeping every session, it felt a stop-start day as, first, he spent the morning on the team's pitwall.\n\nWhile Norris led Verstappen by 0.008sec in another one-two, he gave up his seat to reserve Pato O'Ward in a session designed largely for young prospects and development drivers.\n\nPiastri was doubtless itching to get out on track as his McLaren boss Zak Brown joked: \"There's some guy that has taken my seat!\"\n\nThe humble beginngs that define Oscar Piastri After finishing dead last in his first ever race, Oscar Piastri has risen from humble beginnings to the brink of Australian sporting history as he chases his first F1 world title.\n\nNot much of a laughing matter for Piastri, though, as he started on the back foot in the second session, more representative of what they will all face on Sunday.\n\nHe locked up on his quickest lap and couldn't get near Norris's fastest, with Brown noting: \"Oscar is not totally dialled in yet but he will get there.\"\n\nPiastri certainly did not seem concerned, appearing his usual unflappable self as he told reporters: \"Finding my feet. Clearly, some things to try and improve for tomorrow, but after just one session, not too bad.\n\nOscar Piastri is facing the biggest weekend of his F1 career \u2014 but he still has time for the fans. (AP: Darko Bandic)\n\n\"It's more just little details, the car feels like it's in a pretty decent place, but just didn't get the grip out of it on that first soft lap. So some small tweaks for tomorrow, of course. It didn't feel perfect out there, but nothing major.\"\n\nNorris did not evidently want to get too high himself so early in the week, saying: \"Obviously, from the times, things look good at the minute, but I still want a bit more from the car. I'm not completely happy, or completely confident.\n\n\"We all know it gets a lot closer going into quali. So nothing to smile about just yet.\"\n\nVerstappen had more than a few grumbles about the Friday set-up of his Red Bull, complaining in the morning that \"something is broken on the car\".\n\nAsked what the main issues were by his race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, he replied: \"It is everywhere now.\"\n\nMercedes' George Russell, who could play a key role yet in Sunday's race, was third quickest in second practice.\n\nBrown, meanwhile, revealed McLaren might yet employ team orders in the race, after speculation all week that Piastri could be asked to move over for Norris, sacrificing his own slight championship chance if it appeared Verstappen could be heading for overall victory.\n\nPiastri quiet on key F1 title question Oscar Piastri dodges the question of whether he might help Lando Norris lift the world F1 title in Abu Dhabi, saying McLaren has not discussed the issue.\n\nBrown admitted: \"If, as the race develops, it becomes clear one of our drivers has a significantly better chance than the other, then we're a team that wants to win the drivers' championship and we will race accordingly, to do whatever we can to get that driver in front to try and win the race.\"\n\nHe did not say what sort of chance would qualify as \"significantly better,\" but indicated team orders would only come into play if \"it becomes clear that both (Norris and Piastri) can't\" win.\n\nAsked if he believed Piastri would agree to any order to help out Norris, Brown said: \"Yes. Our drivers have always complied with team wishes, just as we comply with their wishes.\n\n\"I've got no doubt either of our drivers will continue to race as they've done brilliantly, in the best interest of the team.\"\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: Mellissa Dunn)\n\n\" After that, my life changed dramatically. \"\n\nWith limited means to both support her new family and chase her sporting dreams, Mellissa retired in her mid-20s.\n\nNow, after 25 years, Dunn is back on court.\n\nAs both a player in the National Wheelchair Basketball League and a mentor back home in Darwin, she is helping to shape the next generation of territory athletes.\n\nA life-changing accident that led to a new beginning\n\nAt the age of 17, Dunn's life was turned upside down.\n\n\"In 1994 I was completing Year 12 and was involved in a car accident involving a drunk driver,\" she says.\n\n\" I broke my back and injured my neck and became an incomplete paraplegic. \"\n\nDuring rehabilitation in Adelaide, a physiotherapist introduced Dunn to wheelchair basketball.\n\nShe watched Australian athletes training \u2014 strong, confident and laughing together \u2014 and asked if she could join in.\n\nThat moment changed everything.\n\nMellissa Dunn says playing wheelchair basketball and pursuing a Paralympic career was life-changing. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nBut back home in Darwin, Paralympic success seemed out of reach.\n\nThere were no coaches, no specialist facilities and few others to train with \u2014 just determination and a lot of improvisation.\n\nEquipment was scarce and travel costs were crushing.\n\n\"If we wanted to get exposure to the game, we'd spend our weekends at the petrol station, begging people to buy a raffle ticket to support our travels down south,\" she says.\n\n\" You had to be more motivated and determined, because you were pretty much on your own. \"\n\nFrom isolation to a training community\n\nFor years para-athletes in the NT trained in isolation. But recently, that has begun to change.\n\nThe Para Futures Pathways Program, led by Jodie Zanini through the NT Sports Academy, has built the structure for athletes that Dunn once lacked throughout the Northern Territory.\n\nIt provides access to qualified coaches, strength and conditioning facilities, gym support, regular competition and athlete development workshops.\n\nThe Para Futures Pathways Program is giving more NT para-athletes access to the training and facilities they need to be successful. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nLaunched in 2022, the program now supports more than 20 athletes aged 13 to 35.\n\nIt also applies to those living outside of Darwin, where barriers to access like distance and cost make the challenges even greater.\n\nZanini says while it can be challenging to reach athletes across such a vast region, the goal is inclusion for all Territorians, from Darwin to remote Arnhem Land.\n\n\"The whole point of this system uplift is to bring people along for the ride quicker,\" Zanini says.\n\nJodie Zanini says the aim of the program is to give para-athletes the support they need to achieve their goals more quickly. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\n\"We want more athlete representation by the 2032 Brisbane Paralympics, and for people with disabilities to have real opportunities here at home.\"\n\nThe difference the program has made, Dunn says, is \"life-changing\".\n\nAnd where NT para-athletes once trained mostly on their own, Zanini says today the program allows up-and-coming athletes to train alongside their peers, providing a sense of community.\n\n\"What brought me back to wheelchair basketball was the fabulous community we have,\" Dunn says.\n\n\"Everyone is so supportive of each other.\"\n\nThe pathways program gives para-athletes access to gym support. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nThat sense of belonging is what Zanini wants every athlete to experience.\n\n\"Anyone with a disability can come and try sport,\" she says.\n\n\"Not everyone feels comfortable just rocking up to a club.\n\n\" We make sure there's a pathway for them after they try it. \"\n\n\"The whole point is to bring people along for the ride quicker and create a legacy that lasts beyond 2032.\"\n\n17yo Arnhem Land para athlete set to compete in world championships Arnhem Land teenager Briseis Brittain is set to represent Australia at the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi, competing in the 200m and 400m races.\n\nDunn says she can see the difference.\n\n\"Back then, we had to organise everything ourselves: travel, accommodation, airfares,\" she says.\n\n\"These days there's support, so athletes can focus on training and improving.\n\n\"At this stage in my life, I'm happy to support other athletes coming through.\"\n\nNT growing pathways to 2032\n\nNatalie Charlton from Paralympics Australia says the NT's rapid progress in para-athlete development has caught national attention.\n\n\"It's not a matter of the NT catching up to the rest of the nation. The NT is doing incredible things and developing pathways,\" she says.\n\nNatalie Charlton says the NT is no longer catching up to the rest of the country when it comes to opportunities on offer to para-athletes. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nCharlton says she hopes the territory's homegrown athletes will feature strongly in the Brisbane 2032 Paralympic Games.\n\n\"I'd love to see athletes representing at the 2032 Games, who've been able to develop as athletes at home in the Northern Territory,\" she says.\n\nDunn comes full-circle\n\nDunn isn't looking to don the green and gold again and play for Australia. Instead, she has set her sights on inspiring the next generation.\n\n\"I'd like to see younger athletes have the same incredible opportunities that I got to experience,\" she says.\n\n\"I hope that one day I can inspire future athletes in the same way previous athletes have inspired me.\n\n\" Behind every success is a great community. \"",

        "text": "A Queensland hospital has increased staffing and revamped its radiology protocols following the death of an 87-year-old farmer after routine surgery, an inquest has heard.\n\nTen Sunshine Coast University Hospital (SCUH) staff were cross examined at a coronial inquest this week in order for Deputy State Coroner Stephanie Gallagher to determine the circumstances of Terry Airey's death on June 11, 2022.\n\nThe beloved father and grandfather, who lived in Gympie for more than 50 years, leaves behind his wife Josie and six children from two marriages.\n\nThe four-day inquest heard his death was a result of organ failure after surgery performed by an unsupervised training doctor.\n\nOutside the Maroochydore Magistrates Court where the inquest was held, family members told the ABC they wanted to understand the \"human error\" at play in his death to prevent similar, preventable deaths from befalling another family.\n\n'Chaotic day' of surgery\n\nMr Airey presented to SCUH for a scheduled surgery, in pain with a cyst that was described in court as \"gigantic\", \"unusual\", and \"uncommon\" on Wednesday June 8, 2022.\n\nHe was admitted to the hospital's interventional radiology suite.\n\nBianca Stringer, the barrister representing Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service, said it was a \"chaotic day\".\n\nDr Roger Wilson \u2014 who was undergoing his fellowship at SCUH under the supervision of Dr Johnathon Langton and Dr Paul Leschke \u2014 drained Mr Airey's kidney cyst of about 2 litres of fluid.\n\nDr Wilson told the court he was taught to refill the cyst with half the amount that was drained.\n\nHowever, there was only 320ml of the medical grade ethanol available.\n\nDr Langton told the court his rule of thumb was to never exceed 100ml of ethanol.\n\nDr Leschke said he was aware of both guidelines.\n\nThe court heard Mr Airey was exposed to toxic levels of alcoholic betadine, 30 per cent, and medical grade ethanol at 96 or 98 per cent, but treated by staff as 100 per cent.\n\nCoroner Gallagher established it was an inappropriate amount of ethanol to instil but did not contribute to the death.\n\nCyst not drained a third time\n\nAfter the procedure, while in recovery, a senior nurse drained and refilled Mr Airey's cyst twice with 1 litre of alcoholic betadine, rotating him in between.\n\nThe court heard the nurses expected Dr Wilson to perform the final drainage.\n\nDr Wilson said he believed the nurses had performed the final drainage, though he aspirated about 20ml of residual fluid.\n\nNo staff used the ultrasound in the recovery room to check if Mr Airey's cyst had been drained, the court heard.\n\nThe inquest will determine if adequate procedures are now in place to prevent similar deaths. (ABC News: Jake Grant)\n\nExpert witness Dr John Richards, the medical director of imaging at Gold Coast University Hospital, told the court rotating an older patient could have kinked the catheter and contributed to his death.\n\nThe inquest heard on the evening of the surgery, Mr Airey returned to Gympie, about 100 kilometres away, with 1 litre of alcoholic betadine still in his cyst and the drain removed.\n\nLater that night, Mr Airey presented to the Gympie Hospital and was transferred back to SCUH where his cyst was drained the following day.\n\nHe died three days later on June 11.\n\nHospital protocol overhauled following death\n\nThe inquest heard since Mr Airey's death SCUH had increased staffing and implemented procedural changes, with senior doctors to be the primary operators and to not allow nurses to perform drainage and exchanges.\n\nThere were also updates to the tracking of fluids in the patient, with a paper fluid chart staying with every patient in recovery and ultrasounds being undertaken after every procedure.\n\nStaff must breathalyse each sclerotherapy procedure patient before the procedure and not continue if they do not blow zero.\n\nThey must also breathalyse each sclerotherapy procedure patient after the procedure and the patient must blow zero or below 0.05 with two readings showing a downward trajectory.\n\nThe hospital also implemented that one nurse stay with the patient in recovery until they are discharged. Mr Airey was passed on to multiple nurses.\n\nSurgeries were also scheduled for earlier in the day, as Mr Airey's surgery was pushed back to after 2pm.\n\nDoctors are not too instil more than 100ml of ethanol, complex surgeries are double scrubbed, and rosters are distributed eight weeks in advance with staff pre-assigned duties.\n\nHospital staff have also been given written sclerotherapy procedure protocols and guidelines.\n\nSpeaking to media outside court the Airey family said it was satisfied with the changes.\n\nCoroner Gallagher also commended SCUH for implementing the changes.\n\nShe said she would only take submissions regarding instilling and not draining the last litre of alcoholic betadine as this had ultimately caused Mr Airey's death.\n\nCoroner Gallagher's findings are expected in six to eight months.",

It was just nice to do that. I gained a lot of confidence out of that.\"\n\nDespite describing himself as a \"pretty gritty player\", Smith cut a casual figure as he strode the fairways in his second round, playing alongside rising Australian star Elvis Smylie and Englishman Danny Willett.\n\nThe laid-back Queenslander seemed to thrive on the fact much of the spectator interest surrounded the star-studded trio of Rory McIlroy, Min Woo Lee and Scott, who were playing ahead of his group.\n\nCameron Smith (right) played with Danny Willett during the second round on Friday. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nThat is not to say the galleries following Smith, Smylie and Willett were lacking in numbers, as there was enough fan support to create a vibrant atmosphere.\n\n\"There wasn't yelling and screaming out there, thank God,\" Smith said.\n\n\"There was a lot of people. But it was good fun out there.\"\n\nSmith's form line ahead of the Australian Open might have left tournament organisers anxious about whether one of their drawcards would be playing this weekend.\n\nAfter a promising start to the Australian PGA Championship in Brisbane last week, Smith capitulated in his second round to miss the cut at 2-over.\n\nThe 32-year-old comfortably avoided the same fate in Melbourne but stressed he did not travel to the Victorian capital just to make up the numbers.\n\n\"I'm not here to make the cut,\" Smith said.\n\n\"I'm here to win the Stonehaven Cup and I've put myself in a good spot to do that, so I'm really happy with that.\"\n\nSmith, Scott and Ortiz will tee off in the second-last group of the third round at 11.39am AEDT.",

And when exactly will the Macquarie Point precinct transform from an industrial wasteland to an elite sporting hub?\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nThe official timeline has the Devils starting to play at the new stadium in 2029. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nFirst things first \u2014 will the stadium be ready for 2029?\n\nMacquarie Point Development Corporation chief executive Anne Beach is in charge of transforming the site, best known at the moment for hosting bits of the Dark Mofo winter festival and as the home of a sewage plant.\n\nShe says it's too early to commit to when AFL games could first be hosted on the new ground.\n\n\"We'll be able to lock down and communicate clearly with the community the timelines and the key milestones along that delivery pathway and what they can expect to see when once we appoint the major construction contractor,\" Ms Beach said.\n\nTasmania Devils CEO Brendon Gale (centre). (ABC News: Mackenzie Heard)\n\nBut Tasmania Devils chief executive Brendon Gale says he's not holding his breath that the stadium will be ready for Round 1 in 2029, despite it being in the contract between the AFL and the state government.\n\n\"It's probably an assumption internally that we'll be playing games in Hobart and Launceston at Bellerive and York Park for two years,\" he said.\n\nWith the Devils set to enter the AFL in 2028, that means he's preparing for it to be ready in 2030.\n\nWho will build it?\n\nThe stadium will be built in the Macquarie Point precinct. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nA yet-to-be-appointed major contractor.\n\nThe process to find a builder, who will also help to finalise the stadium's design, won't be quick.\n\nMs Beach says she hopes an expression of interest process to find that contractor will open in January, with a tender process to follow.\n\nThe time frame for the actual appointment of that contractor is the final quarter of 2026, so October to December next year.\n\nWhen will construction actually begin?\n\nThere's going to be a fair bit happening on the site next year (more on that below), but Ms Beach says building a stadium won't actually start for about 18 months.\n\nThat's because the corporation first needs to appoint a contractor, and get building and plumbing approval from the Hobart City Council.\n\n\"So we would expect to hopefully have everything in place to start around May 2027,\" she said.\n\nA render of the internal concourse around the edge of the seating bowl at the Macquarie Point stadium. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nCan the stadium really be delivered on budget?\n\nThat's the question that will come up endlessly over the next few years.\n\nAs part of deals to get the stadium through parliament, the state government committed to limiting the amount paid by Tasmanian taxpayers at $875 million.\n\nThat means it has only two options if the project budget blows out again: make decisions to \"value manage\" the project and reduce its cost, or get extra funding from the federal government, Cricket Australia, the AFL or private investors.\n\nWhat would it be like to visit the proposed Hobart stadium? Setting all the politics aside \u2014 just for a moment \u2014 what would it actually be like to visit the building at the heart of Tasmania's fiery stadium debate?\n\nMs Beach says MPDC has already made a series of decisions to value manage the project.\n\n\"There are efficiencies in the way that the foundations are done, the way we support different structures,\" she said.\n\n\"One, for example, is the rakers, which is the steel that supports the concrete seating bowl. By moving those to a double raker rather than a single gave us some efficiencies and some savings in steel.\"\n\nShe says those decisions will be made throughout the process, making sure that cost is managed without compromising the quality of the stadium.\n\nMacquarie Point Development Corporation boss Anne Beach and Tasmanian Treasurer Eric Abetz at the construction site. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nTreasurer Eric Abetz says he's confident the project can be delivered for the current price tag, continually stressing that the government has received what's called a \"P90\" \u2014 which is a cost estimate made by a quantity surveyor with 90 per cent certainty.\n\nBut as economist Saul Eslake points out, construction costs continue to rise.\n\nHe says it's likely that the $1.13 billion estimate will increase by the time the stadium is delivered.\n\nHow the government responds if and when that happens will be crucial.\n\nDoes any work happen between now and the contractor appointment?\n\nYes. Two big tenders have just gone out.\n\nThe first is to excavate contaminated soil (it is a former industrial site after all) and to level the land.\n\n'Fair assumption': Devils boss warns of stadium debut delay The Tasmania Devils CEO says the club will likely play in the AFL from existing venues for a year longer than expected.\n\nMs Beach says there's still about 130,000 cubic metres, or 220,000 tonnes of contaminated land on the site.\n\nThe other tender is to dismantle the heritage-listed Goods Shed, which will eventually be relocated at the concourse level on the northern end of the site.\n\nMs Beach says the pieces of shed will be stored for a couple of years, until an underground half-ring road and a few other facilities are built below it.\n\nThe company that wins the tender will also be in charge of working out exactly how the shed will actually be dismantled, and then put back together.\n\nOne of the first steps will be to dismantle the heritage-listed Goods Shed. (Supplied: Nearmap)\n\nWhat happens to the Red Shed?\n\nThat shed is the home of Hobart Brewing Co.\n\nThe plan is for that to be removed soon after the company's lease ends in June, at roughly the same time as the Goods Shed is packed up.\n\nIs there any work to test the roof?\n\nCricket Australia is pretty confident that the stadium will be able to host domestic and international cricket matches, despite some initial concerns.\n\nBut Ms Beach says a test rig to examine what shadows will be cast by the proposed roof, how much light it lets in, and what it means for grass growth, will be installed on the site in February next year to make sure that the roof design delivers before the tender process begins.",

No planes allowed.\n\nThe plan is to join his parents, who are both members of the Barmy Army supporting the England cricket team on the Ashes tour.\n\nHe told Saturday Extra's Nick Bryant why he was inspired to take on such an epic trek.\n\nAustralia delights in English woe Australia took control of the second Ashes Test at the Gabba on a day that carried plenty of the hallmarks of failed English tours of yesteryear.\n\n\"It'd be a great way to get myself off the beaten path and force myself to see different parts of the world that otherwise I wouldn't go to,\" Lamb said.\n\n\"That's \u2014 that's the sort of travel I want to do.\"\n\nHis journey has taken him from England through Western Europe, into the Balkans, then south through T\u00fcrkiye into Iran, Pakistan and China and on to south-east Asia.\n\nWith his trusty cricket bat in his backpack, Lamb has found a way to get a game of some sort happening in every country he's visited.\n\n\"Every time I spend the night in a place, a new place, I try and play some cricket there,\" Lamb said.\n\n\"You get all these people giving you weird looks: 'What on earth are you asking?

I love my cricket obviously, as well,\" Lamb said.\n\n\"My dad, about two years ago, was just telling a story of two people that did this same trip in the 1970s and when I heard him talking about that, I thought that sounded great.\n\n\"I knew I wanted to go to the Ashes during my year off, I knew it would collide, and I thought, well, if I could get to the Ashes without a plane, it'd be a great way to make content online.\"\n\nLamb has been publishing a daily log of his journey on his Instagram account. His video diaries have documented his travels \u2014 warts, cuts, breaks, bruises and all \u2014 including a serious motorcycle accident in Vietnam.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"I've never driven a motorbike before, so it was just the stupidest thing you could possibly do as an 18-year-old Brit travelling in south-east Asia,\" Lamb said.\n\n\"So, I fractured my skull, broke my nose, had quite a few bad scratches here and there, but it wasn't the end of the world.\n\n\"Spent a few days in hospital, thankfully, was very well taken care of and then a few days in a hotel.\n\n\"I just felt worse telling my mum \u2014 that was probably the most nerve-racking part of the whole thing, rather than the accident itself.\"\n\nHe's experienced unexpected delights like discovering the beauty of Iran.\n\n\"Absolutely loved it, it was one of my favourite places that I've been to,\" Lamb said.\n\n\"I mean that there's definitely a bias here that I think when I was in Iran, every day you wake up and as a Westerner, as a Brit, you're sort of thinking, 'oh my God, I'm in Iran' and you can't quite believe it.\n\n\"It wasn't what I expected to find \u2014 it was a beautiful place with beautiful people and you gotta separate the government from the rest of it.\"\n\nThat was in stark contrast to his experience in the Pakistan province of Balochistan, where terrorist attacks and bombings have killed hundreds this year alone.\n\nThe Australian government's Smartraveller website recommends against travelling to the province because of the poor security situation and high risks of kidnapping.\n\nLamb found himself shuffled from police car to police van and spent two nights sleeping in cells.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"I'm travelling for 12 hours in a day, that'll probably be about 20 different military escorts because every time you move district, you get into a new car,\" Lamb said.\n\n\"So, on the first day, I only got about halfway into Balochistan and I was in the middle of absolutely nowhere, dropped off in this town.\n\n\"It was about midnight, and they basically said to me, 'there's no hotels here. You're gonna have to stay in the prison cell.'\n\n\"I have a few Pakistani friends back home and when I told them I was going into Balochistan, they couldn't quite believe it themselves.\n\n\"My logic always goes that, you know, if the locals can survive it for their whole lives, I'm sure I can survive it for a couple of days.\"\n\nHis next stop was south-east Asia, where he got stuck in floods in Thailand before losing his luggage and passport after leaving them in a car.

And then having dementia as well on top of all of that \u2026 her needs are very complex.\"\n\nJune Beutel signs in Auslan with her niece Brita Murphy. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nMs Murphy has spent the past two years advocating for Auslan services \u2014 the Australian Deaf community's language, for her aunt in aged care.\n\nThe process has highlighted gaps in care available for Deaf seniors in Australia.\n\n\"I feel disheartened that in 2025 it is an issue that a deaf person in an aged care facility cannot have access to Auslan,\" Ms Murphy said.\n\nChief executive of the national peak body Deaf Connect, Brett Casey, told the ABC Ms Beutel's story reflects \"what many families experience when trying to secure culturally appropriate care for Deaf seniors\".\n\n\"Most mainstream nursing homes do not have access to an Auslan-proficient workforce, despite that responsibility sitting with the facility,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a nationwide shortage of Auslan-fluent support workers and the pathway to train existing staff to an appropriate level takes time.\"\n\nJune Beutel's family visit her each week, including her great nieces. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing said while it funds Deaf Connect, who is the provider for the National Sign Laguage Program (NSLP), the NSLP \"does not provide funding for aged care workers like social support or personal care workers\".\n\nThese service gaps mean the only time Ms Beutel can communicate is when her family visits.\n\n\"I'll sit with her and then she'll just burst into tears,\" said Ms Murphy.\n\n\"She'll say 'I'm on my own, it's just me' \u2026 she is so confused.\"\n\nBrita Murphy has spent the past two years advocating for Auslan support for her aunt in aged care. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nNo funding available\n\nBetween full-time work, caring for her four children, and looking after her father who is also deaf, Ms Murphy has been exploring avenues for Auslan support.\n\nShe has contacted the national peak bodies Deaf Connect and Deaf Australia, the Commonwealth Volunteer Visitors Scheme, her local MP, and had a number of meetings with the Ozcare nursing home where her aunt lives.\n\n\"No matter where I go \u2026 nothing is done, no one can tell me why there is no funding or any program that can bridge that communication gap,\" she said.\n\nAuslan is not included as an option in the language list when applying for My Aged Care, which Mr Casey has said means Deaf seniors face access barriers \"from the first step\".\n\nDeaf man rationing Auslan interpreting after 'gutting' NDIS cut Disability advocates say cuts to Deaf participants' NDIS funding is a \"systemic\" problem that reflects a belief that Deafness can be \"fixed\".\n\nHe said Deaf Connect could provide Auslan-fluent support workers \"to supplement care for some residents\", but it was \"only possible when the service is identified and funded by the nursing home\".\n\nIn June, Ms Murphy lodged a formal complaint with the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, who launched an investigation into Auslan accessible services.\n\nDuring the investigation, Ozcare confirmed it would provide Ms Beutel with a support worker two hours a fortnight, which only lasted a few visits due to resourcing.\n\n\"At the moment we are just back to square one \u2026 and it has just been heartbreaking to see that she is so isolated,\" Ms Murphy said.\n\nJune Beutel and Brita Murphy's first language is Auslan. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nOzcare's chief executive Michael Crutcher told the ABC: \"Ozcare provides as much assistance as possible to residents whose needs go beyond the usual span of aged-care support measures\".\n\nBut Ms Murphy worries that if her aunt needed help, or was in pain, there would be no way for staff to know.\n\n\"She just has to basically tolerate what she's feeling, there's no ease for her,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson from the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission said the new Aged Care Act \"means that people receiving care have a right to communicate in the language or method they prefer. Aged care providers should understand and follow the Statement of Rights.\"\n\n'Falling through the cracks'\n\nAccording to the latest census, more than 16,000 Australians use Auslan at home, but there is no exact data on how many of these people live in aged care.\n\nCouple 'effectively unable to be involved in care decisions' before man's death Bruce Drabsch's daughter Melinda Dagger, who was travelling to hospital to be with her ailing father, was phoned by a doctor and asked to inform her mother her husband of more than six decades had died, because no Auslan interpreter was provided.\n\nGiven her age, Ms Beutel is not eligible for NDIS funding, and because she is in aged care, she cannot access services through the Aged Care Assessment Team.\n\nProfessor Piers Dawes, director of the Centre for Hearing Research at the University of Queensland, said people like Ms Beautel can fall through the cracks.\n\n\"Hearing impairment tends to be under recognised and under supported \u2026 because it's not a visible sort of problem,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Dawes has led a number of national projects exploring how to better identify and support the needs of people with hearing impairments in aged care settings.\n\nBrita Murphy signs with her aunty June Beutel (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nHe said the \"particular cultural and communication needs of Deaf people\" are often overlooked, despite it being a basic level of care.\n\n\"The most common reason for [moving into aged care] is that people have dementia, so they are not able to look after themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"If you can imagine all of that being compounded by not being able to communicate well with your carers or engage in social activities \u2026 you can imagine what an awful situation that would be,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Piers Dawes, director of the Centre for Hearing Research at the University of Queensland, says the cultural needs of Deaf elders are often overlooked. (Supplied: Piers Dawes)\n\nRegis Aged Care Blackburn in Victoria has a dedicated wing for Deaf residents, with staff either deaf themselves, or trained in Auslan.\n\nProfessor Dawes said more facilities like this are needed.\n\n\"There is a whole rich culture associated with the Deaf community \u2026 ideally somebody might have the option of specialised services.\"\n\nDeaf advocate Sherrie Beaver said this is particularly important for \"Deaf people born in the 1960s\", when the rubella epidemic led to a significant number of babies born deaf in Australia.\n\nShe's worried the aged care sector is not prepared for the next two decades, when many of these individuals will likely be entering care settings.\n\n\"There are so many heartbreaking stories of Deaf seniors being isolated in aged care, not having ample access to social opportunities,\" she said.",

Verstappen was also noted by stewards for impeding Norris in the first flashpoint of the weekend after the champion had been fed wrong information by his race engineer, but they decided not to investigate further.

For Piastri, desperate for the pace he had in Qatar last weekend when only McLaren\u2019s strategy blunder stopped him sweeping every session, it felt a stop-start day as, first, he spent the morning on the team\u2019s pitwall.\n\nWhile Norris led Verstappen by 0.008sec in another one-two, he gave up his seat to reserve Pato O\u2019Ward in a session designed largely for young prospects and development drivers. Piastri was doubtless itching to get out on track as his McLaren boss Zak Brown joked: \u201cThere\u2019s some guy that has taken my seat!\u201d Not much of a laughing matter for Piastri, though, as he started on the back foot in the second session, more representative of what they\u2019ll all face on Sunday. He locked up on his quickest lap and couldn\u2019t get near Norris\u2019s fastest, with Brown noting: \u201cOscar is not totally dialled in yet but he will get there.\u201d\n\nPiastri certainly didn\u2019t seem concerned, appearing his usual unflappable self as he told reporters: \u201cFinding my feet. Clearly, some things to try and improve for tomorrow, but after just one session, not too bad. \u201cIt\u2019s more just little details, the car feels like it\u2019s in a pretty decent place, but just didn\u2019t get the grip out of it on that first soft lap. So some small tweaks for tomorrow, of course. It didn\u2019t feel perfect out there, but nothing major.\u201d Norris didn\u2019t evidently want to get too high himself so early in the week, saying: \u201cObviously, from the times, things look good at the minute, but I still want a bit more from the car. I\u2019m not completely happy, or completely confident. \u201cWe all know it gets a lot closer going into quali. So nothing to smile about just yet.\u201d Loading\n\nVerstappen had more than a few grumbles about the Friday set-up of his Red Bull, complaining in the morning that \u201csomething is broken on the car\u201d. Asked what the main areas of issue were by his race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, he replied: \u201cIt is everywhere now.\u201d Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, who could play a key role yet in Sunday\u2019s race, was third quickest in second practice. Brown elaborated on the prospect that McLaren might yet employ team orders in the race. Brown admitted: \u201cIf, as the race develops, it becomes clear one of our drivers has a significantly better chance than the other, then we\u2019re a team that wants to win the drivers\u2019 championship and we will race accordingly, to do whatever we can to get that driver in front to try and win the race.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cI was rebelling against everything,\u201d Gehry said in an interview with The New York Times in 2012, explaining his antipathy toward the dominant architectural movements of the time, as exemplified by the Farnsworth House on the Illinois prairie, a stark, flat, steel-and-glass modernist pavilion by Mies van der Rohe. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live in a house like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to come home, clean up my clothes, hang them properly. I thought it was snotty and effete. It just didn\u2019t feel like it fit into life.\u201d The Gehry-designed Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at UTS Business School in Sydney. Credit: Fairfax Media For some, his work was more sculpture than architecture. Others saw it as emblematic of a global culture that reduced architecture to a form of branding. Gehry, whose name was recognised around the world, was sometimes derided as a \u201cstar-chitect\u201d. But his work\u2019s emotional ferocity could feel empowering, as if architecture had rediscovered a part of itself that had been lost after decades of dreary functionalism and postmodernist cliches. And the widespread focus on his buildings\u2019 dazzling exteriors could distract from Gehry\u2019s deeper goals: to create an architecture that was not just affecting but democratic in spirit and evocative of the messiness of human life.\n\nHe was born Frank Owen Goldberg on February 28, 1929, in Toronto to Irving and Sadie (Caplan) Goldberg. His father held a series of jobs, including managing a grocery store and selling pinball and slot machines. Frank and his sister, Doreen, lived with their parents in a two-family house clad in brick and tar-paper shingles (a material he would use in some of his designs). As a boy, he worked part-time in his maternal grandfather\u2019s hardware store, stocking the shelves with tools, screws and bolts \u2013 an experience, he said, that spawned his love of everyday materials. The Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, another Gehry masterpiece, opened in 2003. Credit: Getty Images Once a week, his maternal grandmother would come home from the market with a live carp, another formative experience, which would inspire the fish imagery that later appeared in his work. \u201cWe\u2019d put it in the bathtub,\u201d Gehry recalled, \u201cand I\u2019d play with this fish for a day until she killed it and made gefilte fish\u201d (a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish). Frank\u2019s world abruptly fell apart in the mid-1940s, when his father, a heavy drinker, had a heart attack as the two were arguing on the front lawn, a memory that Gehry said haunted him for decades. His father never fully recovered. After a doctor warned that he would not survive another Toronto winter, the family moved to Los Angeles, renting a cramped $US50-a-month apartment in a run-down neighbourhood just west of downtown.\n\nAs an architect, Gehry was a late bloomer. After a brief stint in the army, he married Anita Snyder, who helped pay his way through the University of Southern California, where he initially studied ceramics. He shifted to architecture after a teacher introduced him to Raphael Soriano, a pillar of postwar modernism in Southern California. (It was around this time, too, that he adopted Gehry as his surname, a somewhat random choice inspired, he said, by the desire to avoid antisemitism.) Gehry spent several years toiling as a mid-level designer and project manager at Gruen Associates, a firm known for its shopping malls. After he opened his own office in 1962, much of his early work was for mainstream developers. He designed a sprawling headquarters for the Rouse Co. in Columbia, Maryland, and two unremarkable department stores for Joseph Magnin in California. \u2018You go into architecture to make the world a better place. A better place to live, to work, whatever. You don\u2019t go into it as an ego trip.\u2019 Frank Gehry, speaking in 2012 But he was an outsider by nature, and he began looking beyond the work of other architects for inspiration. Like many Angelenos, he was drawn to the laid-back, anything-goes atmosphere of the city, whose mix of garish mansions, flimsy bungalows, vacant lots, Googie\u2019s coffee shops and colourful billboards was the antithesis of East Coast architectural academicism. And he became close to a generation of Los Angeles artists \u2013 Robert Irwin, Billy Al Bengston, Ed Moses, Larry Bell \u2013 whose surfboard-inspired aesthetic and raw work spaces suggested an alternative to the chilly austerity of late modernism and the reactionary tendencies of postmodernism.\n\n\u201cThe artists were living in industrial buildings and warehouses,\u201d Gehry said in the 2012 interview with the Times. \u201cThey were constantly moving things around \u2013 changing the rooms, building lofts or storage spaces. It was so free and unselfconscious. I wanted to do that.\u201d In the late 1960s, Gehry and his wife divorced, and in 1975, he married Berta Aguilera. She survives him, along with their two sons, Sam, an architectural designer, and Alejandro, an artist; a daughter, Brina Gehry, from his previous marriage; and his sister, Doreen Gehry Nelson. Another daughter from his first marriage, Leslie Gehry Brenner, died in 2008. Gehry\u2019s approach to his own Santa Monica home divided critics \u2013 and his neighbours. Credit: wikipedia.org The Gehrys bought their Santa Monica house, a two-story pink-stucco affair, in 1977. At Aguilera\u2019s prodding, he began to tear it apart. The house\u2019s rough, unfinished appearance attracted the attention of architecture critics, even as it infuriated neighbours. But its tormented forms \u2013 suggesting a world that had been ripped up and gently pieced back together \u2013 had their own kind of beauty. And the use of crude, everyday materials was Gehry\u2019s assertion that the working-class aesthetic he had grown up with could be as appealing as anything found in the more refined corners of the city.\n\nDecades later, he and Aguilera moved out of the little house that had first brought him fame and into a more luxurious spread overlooking Santa Monica Canyon. Designed with his son Sam, the new house was a sprawling, sometimes awkward composition of angled, heavy-timber posts and beams. Nonetheless, it retained some of the rough-and-tumble qualities of Gehry\u2019s earlier architecture, and its jostling forms reflected a lifelong quest for emotional and creative freedom. Gehry kept on working. An interior view of Gehry\u2019s Luma Foundation building in Arles, France. Credit: Getty Images In 2017, he completed the Pierre Boulez Hall in Berlin, designed in collaboration with conductor Daniel Barenboim: a compact, box-like space with a sunken floor and a floating elliptical balcony, contained inside an austere neo-classical building from the 1950s. And in 2021, the Luma Foundation building in Arles, in southern France, was finished; a twisting tower of stainless-steel bricks, it was inspired, in part, by the rocky terrain of the nearby Alpilles mountain range. At his death, Gehry was completing several projects for luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, including an 7618-square-metre flagship store for Louis Vuitton in Beverly Hills, California, and, in Paris, the conversion of an abandoned 1960s building into an exhibition space and events hall down the block from Arnault\u2019s Fondation Louis Vuitton building.

        "text": "Loading Wests Tigers Rugby League Football Club Pty Ltd is a voting member of ARLC and a licensee of the NRL, entitling it to participate in the NRL competition. Wests Tigers first participated under that licence in 2000. Before that time, there were the Balmain Tigers and the Western Suburbs Magpies; creatures hardly known for living in harmony in the wild. Each is a foundation rugby league club with a storied history. Wests Tigers\u2019 membership of ARLC, and its licence agreement tethering it to the NRL, are interdependent - if the licence agreement is axed, the membership of ARLC cuts out too, and vice versa. Wests Tigers is a company with two shareholders: Balmain Tigers Rugby League Football Club Limited, and Wests Magpies Pty Limited. But this is where things unravel.\n\nThe internal governance of Wests Tigers isn\u2019t a democracy, or anything close to it. Balmain holds 1,000,020 Class A ordinary shares in Wests Tigers; Wests Magpies holds quadruple that number. Wests Magpies owns 80 per cent of the total share equity and voting rights in Wests Tigers. But it wasn\u2019t always that way, as you discover once you examine the history books (and the ASIC registers). Back in the simpler times of 1999, when the Magpies/Tigers arranged marriage was forged \u2013 with the spectre of extinction hovering \u2013 the union at least was an equal one. No more. Sustained financial calamities, striking with dreadful regularity throughout the last quarter-century, have manifested in the renegotiation of arrangements and the destruction of any semblance of balance in what\u2019s now a husk of a \u201cjoint\u201d venture.\n\nThe control of the Balmain and Wests Magpies shareholders is curiouser still. Balmain\u2019s governance is unremarkable in a sporting club sense; the company is in the control of its members. Wests Magpies is fundamentally different. It has two shareholders: Western Suburbs Leagues Club Limited and Western Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club Limited. There\u2019s three shares on issue in Wests Magpies: an A Class share, a B Class share and a C Class. Wests Leagues holds the A Class and B Class shares, Wests Football holds the C Class, but Wests Leagues exerts control over Wests Football regardless. Complicated, much? Wests Tigers is supposed to be governed by a nine-person board that includes \u201cindependent\u201d directors. The concept of being a member of a football club connotes having a democratic say in things. Conversely, that\u2019s not really how the Wests Tigers structure operates. And it seems nobody really values any independent thinkers and doers there.\n\nIn line with the unequal shareholdings, Wests Magpies has the power to appoint many more directors to Wests Tigers than Balmain can. But a different problem exists, in terms of how Wests Magpies itself makes decisions. West Magpies is a registered club, governed by both the Corporations Act and the Registered Clubs Act. The latter legislation prescribes the classes of members a registered club can have, and other internal governance rules. Like most registered clubs, there\u2019s thousands of members. But a bizarre quirk of the Wests Magpies structure, is that the majority of power rests with a cohort of 20 \u201cdebenture\u201d holders, who\u2019ve (apparently) lent the club $100 at an interest rate of six per cent, in consideration for enjoying entry into the inner cabal that effectively controls Wests Magpies in terms of director appointments. It\u2019s those 20 lenders, who control four-fifths of the voting strength of Wests Tigers, and the NRL franchise itself. Democratic? Hardly. But there are other issues here as well. Clause 47.1 of the Wests Tigers constitution says the company shall have a maximum of nine directors.\n\nLoading The appointment, removal and replacement of the directors is to occur in accordance with the company\u2019s shareholder agreement and other instruments. The word \u201cindependent\u201d is used no less than 55 times across the Wests Tigers\u2019 constitution and shareholders agreement. There\u2019s even an entire schedule that defines what the term means. Clause 4.11(g)(ii) of the shareholders agreement, governing the relationship between the Wests Tigers\u2019 shareholders, casts material doubt on whether shareholders (not just Wests Magpies) can effectively give notice to remove an \u201cindependent director\u201d as classified by the documents. Clause 4.11(g)(i) permits a shareholder who appointed a non-independent director to remove that director. Clause 4.11(g)(ii) requires notice from both shareholders AND National Rugby League Limited, to remove an independent director.\n\nWhich then leads to this question: which of Charlie Viola, Michelle McDowell, Annabelle Williams and Barry O\u2019Farrell are the \u201cindependent directors\u201d for the purpose of the Wests\n\nTigers governance documents? Those documents, in places, contemplate there being two independent directors. If there are only two directors of the four that, by proper definition, are the \u201cindependent directors\u201d, legal questions exist about the proper basis for Wests Magpies\u2019 belief that it, as the majority shareholder, can act alone. Wests Tigers CEO Shane Richardson. Credit: Oscar Colman Those questions need answers, before the Wests Tigers descend further. Whether O\u2019Farrell or anyone else would bother torching money seeking Supreme Court injunctions about this stuff is hypothetical \u2013 who\u2019d want to risk further damage to their reputation by seeking to stay in the tent? But assuming that Wests Magpies can issue a notice to remove an independent director, where that notice has proper legal effect, that then leads back to the fundamental question as to why anyone would want to be an independent director at all.",

UBS notes that market analysts have struggled to keep up with gold\u2019s parabolic ascent and says the precious metal could top $US4750 in the second half of next year. People line up to buy gold and silver bullion at ABC Bullion in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer \u201cWe continue to see a supportive market backdrop for gold, noting that the foundations of gold\u2019s ascent \u2013 particularly the structural shift in private and official sector demand \u2013 suggest that price risks remain skewed to the upside over the next 12 months,\u201d UBS analysts say. There may be more to the soaring gold price than Trump, but it would certainly not have achieved its current trajectory without him.\n\nWhile the public focus has been on the sight of Australians literally queuing up to buy gold as the precious metal topped fresh highs, the real action has been from sovereign nations, their reserve banks and wealthy buyers. China and Russia have joined the buying frenzy to avoid the risk of investing in US financial assets in the age of Trump. New figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the country shipped $5.7 billion in non-monetary gold to the rest of the world in October alone. Credit: Bloomberg But they are not alone. Other countries, reserve banks and investment professionals are buying the precious metal by the truck load as a hedge against the so-called debasement of traditional stores of wealth like the US dollar and government bonds, which risk having their value eroded by massive government spending and rising debt levels. The argument is simple, why store your wealth in financial instruments in governments spending way more than they earn, and whose only way out of the fiscal mess is to devalue their currencies and what they owe to lenders via the bond market?\n\nLoading It means that the average buyer at the Perth Mint is merely the froth on our nation\u2019s latest flood of wealth. Australia is one of the globe\u2019s biggest gold producers and exporters, and it is starting to show up in the numbers that count, including Australia\u2019s export numbers and GDP. The Minerals Council of Australia really put things in perspective in October when it forecast that gold is now on its way to becoming our second-biggest export earner behind our world-leading iron ore industry. It forecasts that gold exports will soar this year and top $60 billion, putting it well ahead of Australia\u2019s dominant LNG and coal export sectors.\n\nIt will add to the tens of billions of dollars that Australia as a nation collects from elevated commodity prices each year and acts as a counterbalance to waning bulk commodity prices as China\u2019s economy matures. The most startling metric is how \u2013 despite Trump\u2019s trade war with the world including Australia \u2013 the trade deficit between the two countries has not been this low in more than 20 years. A big driver has been the tenfold increase in gold exports to the US, which topped $US10.6 billion for the year to September. As with our soaring beef trade with the US, this was not how things were meant to pan out for a country like Australia \u2013 built on global trade \u2013 in a world supposedly being forced to choose between the US and China. Local gold miners are already spending a fortune to increase capacity \u2013 including multibillion-dollar deals like ASX-listed Perseus Mining\u2019s pursuing West African gold explorer Predictive Discovery to create a $10 billion gold miner. It is an expensive process to commercially exploit the tiny gold seams, of course, and for the average punter, it\u2019s not easy to get to terms with its modest scale compared to the vast bulk exports of iron ore, coal and LNG.\n\nAustralia will export 900 million tonnes of iron ore this year compared with gold production expectations of just 369 tonnes, according to the MCA. Loading But iron ore trades at less than $US100 a tonne. Gold is currently trading at $US131 million a tonne. And we don\u2019t need to worry about the gold boom going bust just yet \u2013 not with Trump less than a year into his second term. His pick for head of the US Federal Reserve is just the latest threat to the sort of orderly financial world that kills gold booms as professional market watchers know all too well.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nPippa Rae was nine years old when she was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mother, Virginia, says she was a remarkable child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pippa was a really vibrant personality. She was everybody's friend. She had lots of friends. She was sporty, athletic. She just made the most of life. It was almost like she lived an entire life in 11 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a rare and aggressive type of deadly brain cancer that forms in the brain stem - it mainly affects children.\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia says Pippa's diagnosis was shattering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your whole world comes crumbling down. At that point, I didn't realise that it was the worst possible tumour that anybody could be delivered, but I'd never had experience with brain tumours. You know that brain tumours are bad but to know the extent of that - I didn't know at the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cancer is challenging to treat due to its location and infiltrative nature, making surgical removal impossible - so survival rates are so low.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilies are often told to spend their time making memories.\n\n\n\n\n\nPippa died 21 months after she was diagnosed.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was just 11 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were very fortunate that we had 21 months and the majority of that time Pippa was relatively well and she was able to travel with us, so one of the best memories was living out her dream and taking her to Paris, and that's just something that remains with our family forever. It was a very beautiful and special time and we spent two weeks there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Cancer Research Foundation has awarded a $2.5 million grant to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will fund a lab dedicated to research treatments for brain cancers like DIPG in children and glioblastoma - another aggressive type of brain cancer - in adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nKerry Strydom is the C-E-O of the Cancer Research Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There really isn't a fantastic treatment option at the moment and what we are hoping is that this grant will provide hope to families with children with DIPG.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACRF Brainstorm Research Lab will use AI and other tools to test thousands of treatment options and determine the best course of action.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also fund a clean room to make personalised cell therapies for patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Misty Jenkins, the head of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, admits it's a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prognosis for DIPG is the most dismal of any other cancer, and in fact, brain cancers kill more children than any other disease. And so the dial hasn't shifted for decades. And unfortunately oncologists are still having the same conversations with patients, which is telling them to go home and make memories with their families, and that there are no options available. And so we really need to start working together and collaborating better and really start to take more of a creative approach to tackling these really insidious, intractable diseases like brain cancer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brainstorm project will test new drugs as well as therapies for brain cancers, which they hope will speed up the process from discovering treatment options right through to clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an end to end pipeline, so it's going from the drug discovery using AI approaches and liquid handling robots for drug screening all the way through to laboratory based testing all the way through to our patients that are in the operating room, having their tumours removed, and then being able to sequence some quickly and diagnose quickly, and then using that information to inform our drug design.\"\n\n\n\n",

The United States, he said, was \"not doing too well\" before he took office, but now \"we're the hottest country anywhere in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Trump told reporters he did not care about the prize, but noted that he had \"settled eight wars\" in his 10 months in office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't need prizes. I need to save lives,\" Trump said. \"I saved millions and millions of lives, and that's really what I want to do.\"\n\n\n\nThe most logistically complex World Cup in history will be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada from 11 June to 19 July, with 16 more teams added to the global showpiece, up from the 32 nations involved in Qatar in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe draw was co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and American actor and comedian Kevin Hart, and featured performances by the Village People, Robbie Williams and Andrea Bocelli.\n\n\n\n\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars helping to conduct the draw.\n\n\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars helping to conduct the draw.

And he would do that,\" Trump said recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven of the 16 World Cup venues are in the United States, with three in Mexico and two in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Azteca Stadium in Mexico City will host the opening game and the final will take place at the MetLife Stadium outside New York City.\n\n\n\n",

The Congo is an example. Over 10 million people killed, and it was heading for another 10 million very quickly. The fact that we could do that, India, Pakistan, so many different wars that we were able to end, in some cases, a little bit before they started, just right before they started. It was going to be late, but we got them done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Infantino says Trump won the award for exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin says he is ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India, in spite of heavy pressure from the United States for India to stop buying oil from Moscow.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is hosting Mr Putin at a summit in New Delhi dominated by energy, defence and trade talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his first visit to the country since Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr Putin was given a red-carpet welcome with an honour guard and 21-gun salute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the countries pledged to develop multi-faceted relations - and boost trade and the supply of oil and gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nDangerous fire conditions are set to continue across parts of eastern Australia with fears dry lightning risks sparking new blazes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tasmania , authorities say it is not yet safe for residents affected by a fire at Dolphin Sands to return home, after more than a dozen buildings and cars were damaged and two firefighters injured.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut cooler temperatures and showers washing across the state [[on Saturday]] will likely bring relief to fire crews.\n\n\n\n\n\nA fire on the New South Wales mid-north coast at Bulahdelah has been downgraded to advice but is not yet under control.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal fire bans are in place across much of the state, with heatwave conditions set to remain throughout the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, firefighters are working to contain a bushfire in Markwood, northeast of Melbourne, which has affected at least three properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children and Young People has slammed Victoria's new 'adult time for violent crime' laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation passed Parliament late Thursday [[041225]], allowing children as young as 14 to face life sentences for a number of violent crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include home invasion, carjacking and armed robbery, with the legislation mirroring similar tough-on-crime reforms in Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner Sue-Anne Hunter has told NITV that the laws breach Australia's human rights obligations and won't make communities safer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because we're not addressing the underlying issues of whatever that is for that child, whether it be a health issue, undiagnosed, whether it be family violence at home, you know if we don't intervene early, this will continue to happen.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nShoplifting has become so relentless at Orange Supermarket in Sydney's south that staff say it now feels like part of the daily routine.\n\n\n\n\n\nLizhen Cai explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Basically, theft happens every day and on average the losses range from $200-300 on smaller days to $500-600.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the thefts add up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual losses of around $150,000 cut deeply into already-thin margins.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost thefts are small and easily hidden, according to staff member Harry Zhao.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" The most common cases are petty theft, where people quietly slip drinks or snacks into their bags or pockets while browsing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStore assistant Ray Huang says offenders come from all ages and backgrounds, though one group stands out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Offenders range from young to old, but the majority are young people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a view reinforced by a recent Monash University survey of 1,047 Australian shoppers aged 18 and older, released in October.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Consumer Deviance Spotlight report \u2019s lead author is Stephanie Atto:\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Younger people are certainly more accepting of theft. Survey found that 54% of 18-to-34 year olds said that retail theft was justifiable to some degree.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics reported 270,000 retail thefts last year, a rise of 7 per cent on the previous year, and the highest in two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Atto says it\u2019s part of a broader shift in attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" During an alarming crime rise, Australia is certainly more accepting of retail theft and our survey found that one in four believed it was justifiable to some degree to commit retail theft including taking an item and not paying for it. We do expect an increase in retail crime leading up to Christmas and we do say that retailers need to certainly be vigilant and also that police and law enforcement need to be out there looking after retailers as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, Victoria recorded the highest rise in all robberies, up by 16 per cent, followed by Tasmania with 11 per cent. Dr Vincent Hurley is a lecturer in criminology at Macquarie University, and a former police officer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" There's inflation, there's stagnation of their wages if they're working part time. So even to survive, they would consider stealing to be a way to survive in this cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 93 per cent of consumers aged 55 years and older view shoplifting as \u2018not at all justifiable\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Hurley says self-checkouts that depersonalise payments, may be part of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They do not see stealing from an individual, from a person. They see the stealing from an organization, a corporation, which has no face, it has no identity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventy per cent of shop owners report a rise in shoplifting over the past financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite retailers, police and peak bodies uniting to crack down on repeat offenders, Dr Hurley says the crime surge shows no signs of slowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" We should be worried about this trend as a society, absolutely! Low level crime can lead to much wider and more crime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Stoppers Victoria reports that nearly 70 per cent of retail theft in that state is committed by repeat offenders, many operating in well-organised networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one reason Harry Zhao fears fighting theft is a losing battle.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AP / Alex Brandon The other team in the group will be the winner of playoff C, which will be between Turkiye, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo.\n\n\n\n\n\nSocceroos Head Coach Tony Popovic, has described the group as \"tough\", but said the team is \"looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finally finding out exactly who we will be playing at the FIFA World Cup 2026\u2122 makes it all feel a lot more real. Now the real planning can begin,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is still a bit of unknown in drawing a team from UEFA Play-Off C and we play them first \u2014 but we're excited.\"\n\n\n\nHow tough is Australia's group?\n\nThe draw means Australia has avoided coming up against the world's top teams in the group stage, including Spain, Argentina, France, and England.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting on X, a former Australian football player and sports analyst has described Australia's group as \"positive but challenging group for Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Playing home nation will be fantastic, great focus and drama, and the US support at a home event will be immense, and exciting,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States, the world's No.14-ranked team, will be the hardest team Australia is facing. The Socceroos have played the US four times, for one win, one draw and two losses.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Fox, the USMNT manager, Mauricio Pochettino, pointed out their previous clash against Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to respect all the opponents. All is going to be difficult. We know Paraguay was doing so well in the South American qualification. Australia, until we played them, were unbeaten in 12 or 13 games,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Full respect, but yes, believing that we can go through. But we need to perform.\"\n\n\n\nThe last time Australia won a match against the US was their first friendly game in 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia have not played world No.39 Paraguay since a 1-0 friendly win in 2010 but are unbeaten in five clashes \u2014 two wins, three draws \u2014 with the South American team.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Socceroos have never faced Kosovo, they've lost twice to T\u00fcrkiye, have one defeat against Romania and one draw against Slovakia.\n\n\n\nWhen and where are the Socceroos playing?\n\nTeams will wait for confirmation of the venues and dates for all their group matches on Saturday (Sunday morning AEDT). Since the Socceroos are in the group with one of the hosts, their games are likely to be scheduled on North America's west coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Socceroos' opponent for the first match is still unknown, as the national team will play their first match against the winner of playoff C between Slovakia, Kosovo, or Turkiye, on 13 June in Vancouver.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 19 June, Australia will be facing the hosts, United States, in Seattle, probably for their most important match in the group stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix days later, for their last match, Australia will face Paraguay in Santa Clara.\n\n\n\nWhat if the Socceroos qualify?\n\nBased on the new World Cup rules, the top two teams from each of the 12 groups will qualify to the next stage, along with the eight best third-placed teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Socceroos win group D, they will face the best third-placed team from groups A, B, C, D or F, and if they get second, they have to play against the runners-up of group G, one of Egypt, Iran or New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing one of the eight best third-placers will also mean that the Socceroos will face the Group E, I, or K winner.\n\n\n\nFull group draw revealed\n\nGroup A: Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Play-off D winner (Czechia, Ireland, Denmark or Macedonia\n\nGroup B: Canada, Play-off A winner (Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovinam, Italy or Northern Ireland), Qatar, Switzerland,\n\nGroup C: Brazil, Morocco, Haiti, Scotland\n\nGroup D: The US, Paraguay, Australia, Play-off C winner (Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkiye or Romania)\n\nGroup E: Germany, Cura\u00e7ao, Ivory Coast, Ecuador\n\nGroup F: Netherlands, Japan, Play-off B winner (Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania) Tunisia\n\nGroup G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand\n\nGroup H: Spain, Cabo Verde, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay\n\nGroup I: France, Senegal, Play-off 2 winner (Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq), Norway\n\nGroup J: Argentina, Algeria, Austria, Jordan\n\nGroup K: Portugal, Play-off 1 winner (New Caledonia, Jamaica or Democratic Republic of the Congo), Uzbekistan, Colombia\n\nGroup L: England, Croatia, Ghana, Panama\n\nWhich is 'the group of death'?\n\nIt looks like for 2026, it will be hard to pick 'the group of death'.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Group I (France, Senegal, playoff 2 winner \u2014Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq \u2014 and Norway) can be one to watch, as the French superstar Kylian Mbappe, will be facing the Norwegian goal scorer Erling Haaland.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup L (England, Croatia, Ghana and Panama) is another one to watch, as England might be looking for revenge from Croatia, who beat them in the 2018 World Cup semifinal, bringing their World Cup streak to an end at that time\n\n\n\nTrump winning the controversial '2025 FIFA peace prize'\n\nThe event, however, was not just about football, as Infantino presented the inaugural FIFA peace prize to the US President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfantino said the award is presented by \"billions of football lovers\", and they gave the award to Trump for his \"actions to provide peace around the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\nInfantino said: \"This is what we want from a leader, a leader that cares about the people. We want to live in a safe world, in a safe environment \u2026 and you definitely deserve the first FIFA peace prize.\"\n\n\n\nFIFA said the peace prize \"recognises the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations\". Source: AP / Chris Carlson/AP The prize was announced in early November and has since raised questions about whether Trump will be its first recipient.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and Infantino are known to have a close relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfantino has supported Trump\u2019s nomination for this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, and he was the unexpected guest of the Egypt Peace Summit, being invited personally by Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the FIFA peace prize, Trump said: \"This is truly one of the great honours of my life and beyond.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The world is a safer place now ...

Around 34 per cent plan to holiday within their own state and 25 per cent hope to travel interstate. Just 15 per cent of Australians say they're heading overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the states, cities, regions and countries set to attract the most visitors this summer.\n\n\n\nWhat are this year's travel hotspots?\n\nWhen it comes to interstate travel, there are two clear frontrunners: NSW and Queensland, attracting 29 per cent of domestic Australian travellers each.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're followed by Victoria (22 per cent), then Western Australia and South Australia (both 6 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found the most popular individual destination to be the Gold Coast, with 11 per cent planning to soak up the sun there. Sydney (10 per cent), Melbourne (9 per cent) and Brisbane (5 per cent) round out the top picks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther emerging hotspots include Coffs Harbour and NSW's South Coast.\n\n\n\nThe Gold Coast is the most popular destination for Australian travellers this summer. Internationally, Aussies also plan on flocking to New Zealand.

Internationally, colder, snowy destinations are on the rise.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting next Wednesday...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia will become the first country in the world to ban under-16s from having social media accounts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Communications Minister Annika Wells trumpeting the long-awaited social media restrictions for under-16s that she says will help protect them from further harm online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With one law we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine. And on 10th December there are going to be withdrawal symptoms. Teenagers will be upset, some will fight to get back on, some will manage to find their way around the tech and keep their accounts but I truly believe the short-term discomfort will work be worth the long-term benefits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might be wondering what platforms are covered under these restrictions and how exactly the government expects to enforce this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Australia's eSafety Commissioner has identified 10 social media platforms that will now be age-restricted, with the list expected to be broadened in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit,, X (formerly known as Twitter), YouTube, Threads, and live-streaming platforms Twitch and Kick.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wednesday, these platforms must remove accounts of users under the age of 16 and take what the government considers to be reasonable steps to prevent the children from creating accounts on their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they fail to take these steps they will risk being fined up to $50 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tiffani Apps is a senior lecturer at the University of Wollongong and chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These social media spaces have not been designed for children in mind, and we have seen over recent years a number of harms that alarm parents and communities and alarm children as well. I would say that it's an interesting response because it restricts children from accessing the platforms, so restricting children rather than requiring the platforms to create spaces that are safe for children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Apps says each platform will implement the steps differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will see changes come in pretty swiftly, and we've begun to see them over the last couple of weeks. For those platforms that are included, it will look different across those platforms. They're owned by different people and they're managing the restrictions in different ways.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has started removing half a million accounts belonging to teens under 16.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube, on the other hand for instance will be a little different as it doesn't require users to have an account to access content.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder-16s will not be allowed to have active YouTube accounts or subscribe to YouTube channels but children will still be able to watch videos on the website in a logged-out state or under parental supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic support for the Albanese government's changes to the Online Safety Act was one factor in the Labor government's successful re-election campaign heading into the federal election this May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is about letting kids be kids. It's also about empowering parents to be able to have those discussions with their children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of parents in Sydney say they're excited for the pioneering move.\n\n\n\n\n\nVOXIE 1: \"There\u2019s so many mental health implications, and to take that off my hands and leave it to the government to decide. Give my kids a break from after school and they can rest and hang out with the family. I think it\u2019s a great initiative, a great thing.\"VOXIE 2: \"I think it\u2019s fantastic. As a mum of two teenage girls , I\u2019m really pleased with the initiative of the Australian government and I think it's wonderful that they\u2019re a world leader in this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome are a little more sceptical of how it will work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Children are clever. They can work systems much more cleverly than adults actually realise. So it\u2019s going to have a big impact, hopefully for the better, but it's going to take a bit of time to get that rolled in and implemented in the best way possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says platforms must deactivate existing accounts of those under 16, ensure no new accounts are activated, implement workarounds and correct errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut many experts are warning the age verification tools that platforms are using to prevent kids from signing up are far from perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\nChair of Electronic Frontiers Australia, John Pane, says kids could use software or even an older family member to skirt around many of these methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kids are looking at using VPNs obviously to get around the ban. Kids could also use individuals to sit in for them, an older brother or a sister, to take a photograph and have it go through biometric estimation of their age. They can use software to modify their own photograph to make them look older. There are so many ways to get around this. It has more holes in it than swiss cheese.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n15-year-old Noah Jones is one of those teens determined to get around the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm just going to make a new account on Instagram and it'll either ask for me to scan my face or an id and I don't see what's stopping me from getting my older brother's ID or my mum's ID.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says there won't be penalties for parents or young people who find ways to continue using social media, with the onus entirely on platforms to prevent access.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese potential flaws have piled more pressure on the Albanese government to get this social media age restriction right and adapt to the countless number of work-arounds and new social media platforms that are expected to pop up in response.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Communications Minister Annika Wells says, the world will be watching to see how this first-of-its-kind policy will play out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This law is world leading and countries around the world are taking our lead. Denmark, Greece, Romania, France, New Zealand, Malaysia, the European Commission have all signaled intent introduce a minimal age for social media.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the millions of children under 16 who won't find ways around these restrictions, Dr Tiffani Apps says this could be a tough adjustment for kids.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the European Broadcasting Union have elected not to hold a direct vote on Israel\u2019s participation.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they introduced strengthened rules designed to prevent government interference, a response to concerns raised after previous contests.\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany and Austria supported the outcome, describing it as a reaffirmation of Eurovision\u2019s founding principles.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Radio network ARD- ZDF representative Katja Wildermuth says the Union prioritised its values over immediate political pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are very happy that in the end rules and values and impartiality of public service media has been stronger than emotional public debates of the day. We're talking about the biggest song contest in the world and it's a contest that stands for building bridges, for diversity, for tolerance. And we underlined these values today in the debate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria\u2019s Broadcasting Corporation director Roland Weissmann echoes that, noting that the vote reflected democratic process and that Israel\u2019s broadcaster KAN therefore remains eligible to compete.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the European Broadcasting Union formally confirmed Israel\u2019s eligibility for the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, four countries - Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Slovenia - immediately withdrew.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, why did the EBU make this decision and why did many members accept it?\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Lee Adams, founder of Wiwiblogs and one of Eurovision\u2019s most respected analysts, tells the B-B-C that the Union had already acknowledged political interference in earlier contests, and the reforms introduced this week were seen by most broadcasters as sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we do know is that the discussion of new rules was presented; the EBU recognised that there was political interference that occurred during the previous Eurovision, and they had these new rules, additional measures to prevent a recurrence. Apparently countries accepted, as a whole, that those rules were enough and that a vote on Israel's participation did not need to take place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says there is a thin line between politics and the personal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Israel's most recent entry from Yuval Raphael, she was a survivor of October the 7th, some people said that carries a political message, others said no, her song is about perseverance, it's a personal message. This is the problem with art: they're not just kicking a ball on stage, they're being judged for lyrics, for words, for meaning and it all gets very convoluted, and things are misinterpreted, ideas are projected. It's complicated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Vienna, host of next year\u2019s contest, many residents expressed acceptance of Israel\u2019s participation, even if they regretted losing several competing countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustrian resident Bernhard Kleemann says the public should not be punished for the actions of any government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs far as Israel is concerned, I distinguish between the government and the population. Why should the population, or a part of the population, not participate? That is my reasoning. If countries decide not to participate because they condemn the government and the prime minister, that is their decision. That is my bottom line. It's a shame because it means less choice, but it is politically understandable. Yes, that's how I see it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers in Vienna stressed that Eurovision was devised to promote cultural exchange, not political exclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Madrid, the tone was unequivocally different.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Spanish Eurovision fans said their country's withdrawal was necessary given the war in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag performer Enigma Queen captured the sentiment among Spain\u2019s most dedicated fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Honestly, I think it\u2019s great, because since Eurovision doesn\u2019t take steps to remove a genocidal, violent country that causes wars from its festival, it\u2019s very good that Spain withdraws as a form of protest, and hopefully more countries join so the festival can\u2019t go ahead and they stop allowing these things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tel Aviv, the response was one of relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nEurovision fans there said they had spent days fearing exclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nJurij Vlasov says he was stressed over whether the EBU would allow Israel to participate or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel like our reaction is full of happiness and huge relief. Feel like there was a lot of stress in the last hour that they wanted to go into the voting. And I was Oh my God, I'm a guy who's going to be anonymous. I think that's a huge relief right now and a lot of happiness that the Eurovision going to keep the non-political song contest and let it'll be fun and joy for all of Europe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith four nations withdrawing, affecting untold millions of viewers across Europe and around the world, some are speculating whether the contest will be able to go on.\n\n\n\n\n\nEBU leadership have been quick to insist that the contest is not troubled.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Green is Eurovision's director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's in no ways a crisis. We've got 35 members or so going to join us next year. Now, I understand the four or five who might not come. That's their choice. I completely respect that. I very much hope they'll be back with us in 2027 and I also very much hope that they will still broadcast the show and allow those fans who want to watch the show to watch it. But again, that's their choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also noted that Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova are returning to the contest.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS who has Australian broadcast rights for Eurovision 2026, has issued a statement saying that participation in, and coverage of Eurovision will continue in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt continued:\n\n\n\n",

How I can leave this country, go to the different country? Already I have a family in Australia. I want to keep my family, I don't want to stress every time, they call me say 'you are not for Australia', 'you can't live in Australia'. Why? Because I come to Australia for a better life? Because I'm Christian?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSara works as a dental assistant, pays tax, and her legal partner, brother and father are Australian citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she still has to renew her visa every six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every six months my visa is expired. Imagine I told you every six month my Medicare is expired. More than three months I don't have Medicare. Even my visa not allowed to a study, not for a study. Even I can't buy the mobile. I can't buy SIM card. I can't driving in Australia. You know why? If I'm driving or any fault in the street, which is not my fault, okay? That's my issue. Immediately, immigration can cancel it, my visa. Immigration exactly say to me, if we call you, immediately you should answer your phone. For example, if I'm in the toilet, don't answer my phone, immigration can cancel my visa.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSara doesn't have a pathway to permanent residency because of an immigration policy introduced by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the 19th of July 2013, just days before she and her mother arrived by boat:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From now on, any asylum seeker who arrives in Australia by boat, will have no chance of being settled in Australia as refugees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSara and her mother were sent to Christmas Island, then Nauru for processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere, Sara says she faced sexual harassment and horrific living conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth became ill and were medically evacuated, and in a Darwin detention facility, Sara says she witnessed extreme self-harm by people protesting being sent back offshore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The lady was pregnant, maybe three months I couldn't remember exactly the time. She cut it with a knife, her stomach. The baby's come out. That's few years ago but it stays in my mind, I feel it. And the kids, cutting their hands because they don't want to back. Imagine my mum come back from hospital. She's a stay in the room. She go to the keep in the wall and she keep in the hand and officer was inside the my mother room. And I wake up and I mama, what's happened? And I hug it my mom. Mama, you are safe. You don't worry. You are fine. And she's crying loudly 'What's going on? What's going on? I don't want to back. I don't want to back.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSara is one of around 900 people calling on the government to release them from visa limbo.\n\n\n\n\n\n13 year old Hossam spoke at the protest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My brother is 10 now, and he has citizenship but the rest of my family doesn't have a citizenship.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd 13 year old Amir also said he wanted the government to hear his voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I came here when I was 10 months old now I'm 13. I have a little sister she's got her citizenship. I just want the government to give us a chance to call Australia home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir only hope is the intervention of Immigration Minister Tony Burke.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those who have written to him is 23-year-old Ferdos - who requested SBS omit her surname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I got a letter from immigration saying unfortunately you're not eligible for a permanent residency and you've got only two option. It's either you go back to your home country or you choose the third country. But Nauru was the third country. I've spent five years there and I think I've done my time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter Ferdos received came from an unnamed representative of the Department of Home Affairs' Director Resettlement Programs Immigration Compliance Group, writing on behalf of Burke.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said: \"As a transitory person, your stay in Australia is temporary only, and you do not have a permanent settlement pathway in Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt added, \"We encourage all transitory persons to consider their options to depart Australia, either to a third country or return to your home country\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFerdos was just 10 years old when she was put in offshore detention, and has no real connection to any country but Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've lost my entire childhood. The damage is done. I'm not talking about that now. I'm here now. I feel Australian in everything except my paperwork. I do everything and Aussie does. I work. I contribute. I grew up here. I went to school here and I'm doing everything a normal Australian citizen would do. I just need that green light that I don't have.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFerdos works and pays tax, but her visa restricts her from pursuing tertiary education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was a child when all of this happened, and I had no say in how I came here. And I don't know why I'm still being punished. No bank, no educational institution, no one recognised me. And simply because I'm not Australian citizen or I'm not a permanent resident. And despite like living, working, contributing, paying taxes, Australia still doesn't see me as a citizen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura John is an associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, and is Sara Mashalian's lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's among advocates pushing for ministerial intervention in so-called 'legacy cases' that remain unresolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a policy that was implemented over a decade ago. It simply does not reflect the practical reality of Sara's life and the lives of the other people who are caught in this permanent limbo. These are people who work alongside us, whose children go to schools and childcare. These are people who are Australian in every sense of the way other than their visa status. And it's time for the minister to intervene and to grant people in this group permanent visas to accept what is already the case. They are Australian. This is their home, and they deserve to be able to stay here with their families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, 19,000 refugees who also arrived by boat were granted permanent settlement pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\nA the time - the then-Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said it made \"no sense\" to keep people who worked and paid taxes \"in limbo\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut applications were only open to those who arrived before Operation Sovereign Borders began in September 2013, or who already held temporary protection or safe haven enterprise visas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSara and Ferdos were in offshore detention by the cut off, and were never granted one of those visas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say they're left in a permanent state of uncertainty, which has taken a physical and psychological toll.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Sara also fears she's lost the chance to become a mother - as she's delayed having children due to her visa uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to be having children. That's the normal life when you are marriage. How can I imagine if I have a children. I'm 42 years. I can't be older. I have a limited time I can be a mother.\"\n\n\n\n",

Under-16s are now blocked from creating new accounts on either platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner told SBS News the rules apply to young people under 16 who are \"ordinarily resident\" in Australia.\n\n\n\nBut what does \"ordinarily resident\" mean in practice \u2014 and could it include young people on temporary visas, such as international students?\n\n\n\nDoes the ban apply to under-16 international students?\n\nA spokesperson for Meta told SBS News it's unlikely teens who enter Australia for a short holiday will have their accounts restricted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, if they stay in Australia for an extended period, such as long study periods, then our age assurance measures will take effect,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Department of Education, 19,768 international students were enrolled in Australian schools and 331,402 in VET programs as of September this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt isn't clear how many of those students are under 16.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner said temporary visa holders, including international students, should be aware their accounts \"may be flagged\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could include \"age checks, deactivation or removal if platforms receive signals indicating they are in Australia for a significant period of time or indefinitely\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has sought clarification from the eSafety commissioner on what counts as a \"significant period of time\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Citizenship Act (2007) a person is not \"ordinarily resident\" in Australia if they reside in the country for a \"special or temporary purpose only\", but considered resident if they are home or have a permanent abode in the country.\n\n\n\nNot just location data\n\nIt's understood platforms won't rely solely on location data to determine whether a young person is living in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn eSafety spokesperson said the industry will use \"various signals\" to identify a person's country of residence.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner told SBS News they understand Meta will use \"various signals\" to detect users' locations. Source: AAP / Nicholas T. Ansell \"This approach will also be leveraged to prevent issues such as circumvention via VPN as well [as] limit unintended disruption of services to people visiting the country for a short period,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not clear what those signals might be, but the spokesperson said platforms are expected to take reasonable steps to address potential errors, such as mistakenly including a young person .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Platforms should also provide clear ways for people to request a review if they have been age-restricted by mistake,\" they said.\n\n\n\nNearly 'every teen affected'\n\nRoy Morgan research released this week shows 624,000 Australians aged 14 and 15 use at least one social media platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube was the most popular platform, with 95 per cent of young Australians using it.\n\n\n\nSnapchat was next at 87 per cent, followed by Facebook and then Instagram at 81 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Morgan CEO Michele Levine said the number shows how \"deeply social media is embedded in the daily lives of Australian teenagers\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The new legislation to ban social media for Australians under 16, set to be enforced from next week, will affect almost every 14 to 15-year-old in the country.\"\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size At noon on Monday, December 8, 1975, John Woods, a TV journalist from Adelaide fired from his Channel Nine job for taking part in a gay rights march, spoke into the microphone in the basement of the student union building at the University of Queensland. \u201cYou are listening to 4ZZ-FM in Brisbane, bringing you stereo FM rock on a frequency of 105.7 megahertz,\u201d Woods said. \u201c4ZZ-FM is Brisbane\u2019s first new radio station in over 30 years, and first ever stereo FM station \u2026 \u201cWhile some people may not enjoy some of the material we put to air we certainly don\u2019t deny them the right to switch us off. To attempt to impose limitations or restrictions on public broadcasting is to seriously threaten a fundamental liberty, that of free speech.\u201d He then played a song intended as a statement: Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again by British mod rockers The Who. Volunteers, announcer Helen Hambling (second left) and station engineer Ross Dannecker (centre) getting ready for a 4ZZ-FM (4ZZZ) test broadcast, 1975. Credit: Greg Perry/State Library of Queensland The birth of community radio in Queensland did not happen in a slow news week. That same day, journalist Roger East was murdered in Dili \u2013 East Timor having been invaded by Indonesia the day before. Australia was heading into a snap election one week later, following the dismissal of the Whitlam Labor government in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, the premature ousting of Labor was just one in a series of unfortunate events that almost stopped 4ZZZ in its tracks. Just prior to the government\u2019s sacking, the Labor minister Moss Cass had approved 12 licences for community radio stations, including one for a scrappy bunch of radicals, feminists and music fans in the University of Queensland\u2019s student union. 4ZZZ\u2019s future was thrown into jeopardy following the Whitlam Dismissal in 1975. Credit: Michael Howard \u201cWhen [Malcolm] Fraser was put in as the interim prime minister, there was no guarantee that those licences would ever get signed off on,\u201d says Heather Anderson, author of new book-length history of 4ZZZ, People Powered Radio. Ultimately, the acting Postmaster-General in Fraser\u2019s caretaker government, Peter Nixon, reluctantly decided it was a fait accompli. \u201cThe ink was still wet on the licence when they went to air,\u201d Anderson says. Queensland\u2019s first community radio station began the way it would continue for the next 50 years: amid the fires of dissent and oppression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 1971, hundreds of peaceful protesters against the tour of the South African Springboks rugby team were attacked, pursued and beaten by about 500 police in Wickham Terrace, given carte blanche by premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The student union hosted a fiery public meeting the next day. \u201cPeople were angry as all hell because of the bashings,\u201d recalls Jim Beatson. Beatson was studying for an honours degree in Australian history, on the history of communism in Queensland, and as a member of the Labor Party had been active in the Brisbane radical movement of the 1960s. Local media were indifferent to the bashings or had actively taken the side of the police. An alternative voice was desperately needed. \u201cAnd John Stanwell out of the blue said: \u2018Why don\u2019t we set up draft resister radio?\u2019 \u201d Stanwell, a law student who would later spearhead the station\u2019s fundraising through \u2018Joint Effort\u2019 gigs, explains: \u201cIn Melbourne and Sydney at the university campuses, the Draft Resisters Union, which was the public face of the anti-conscription movement, ran a sort of protest pirate radio, and got huge media coverage.\u201d Beatson, who had experience of pirate radio having spent two years in London, consulted an academic and learned that pirate broadcasts are easily triangulated and shut down. He realised the only way to go was to obtain a legal and permanent radio licence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe beauty of this approach was the fact radio licences came under federal jurisdiction \u2013 free from the hectoring of Joh\u2019s goons, unlike left-wing publishing ventures such as the newspaper Beatson worked on, The Brisbane Line, which lasted three issues in 1968.

Credit: Greg Perry/State Library of Queensland After Whitlam\u2019s election in 1972, Beatson, editor of the student union paper Semper Floreat, Alan Knight, and engineering student Ross Dannecker formed the University of Queensland Media Committee to lobby the federal government for an FM licence. Beatson made trips to Canberra and Sydney, attending a conference in 1974. \u201cAll these Trotskyites from Sydney and Maoists from Melbourne were there, and they stood up and started talking about how minorities weren\u2019t having access to the media,\u201d he recalls. Inspired by the UQ Media Committee\u2019s music expert, Stuart Matchett, Beatson stood up and told them: never mind minorities \u2013 majorities weren\u2019t being served by the current system. \u201cWe wanted FM radio because the biggest-selling music in Australia was LPs like Deep Purple and Pink Floyd, not [singles], which dominated commercial radio. \u201cEveryone said it was the speech of the day, and we went from being a collection of unknowns to being thought of as the smartest people campaigning.\u201d \u201cThey weren\u2019t just lobbying for Triple Z to get a licence,\u201d Anderson notes. \u201cThey were lobbying for the federal government to establish a community radio sector.\u201d (There are now around 450 community radio services across the country.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t just lobbying for Triple Zed to get a licence, they were lobbying to establish a community radio sector.\u201d Heather Anderson Following the conference Beatson met with Jane Blaxland at the government Media Department about their licence application. \u201cAnd she says, \u2018Jim, the problem for your group is nobody in Sydney or Melbourne\u2019s ever heard of you. You need people writing letters, like at least one a day,\u2019\u201d Beatson says. A team of seven volunteers was rallied \u2013 including Helen Hambling, who would become one of the station\u2019s first full-time announcers, and future Four Corners producer Marian Wilkinson \u2013 to contact community organisations to write letters of support to the PMG and to Whitlam\u2019s Minister for the Media, Moss Cass. In Anderson\u2019s book, Wilkinson recalls \u201cspending hours and hours and hours and hours on Triple Z work to get the station started ... It was full on. It consumed our lives\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re the unsung heroes,\u201d Beatson says, \u201cthis group of feminists that literally rang every church, every sports group, saying \u2018if we get a licence, you\u2019ll get a spot on the station.\u2019 \u201cJane Blaxland rang me up and said, \u2018Jim, your campaign\u2019s been unbelievably successful, we are getting at least six letters a day coming in.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

The grand foyer \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest rooms \u2013 was filled to the brim with swanky guests wearing lanyards, stands bearing coffee, Taittinger champagne, muffins, cut fruit and Greek yoghurt parfaits. A string octet played while the great and the good mingled and took photos in front of a giant soccer ball and FIFA 2026 signage. Suits and sneakers \u2013 a common combination in the US \u2013 were everywhere. This correspondent inside the FIFA World Cup draw reception. Credit: Michael Koziol Somehow, I\u2019d made it inside the party without even really trying. But I wanted to ditch my peacoat and scarf at the coat check. That meant going back outside. Foolishly, I took the gamble. At first, my attempt to re-enter the red carpet failed. This time, someone on their A-game directed me to the media centre \u2013 two words that have come to strike fear into my heart.\n\nI\u2019ve been at the media centre for plenty of large-scale events, and it\u2019s never good. You are dumped in a drab holding pen with a big screen, far from the action. Fortunately, I found my way through the car park back to the red carpet, where I arrived just in time to spot FIFA boss Gianni Infantino posing with Brazilian soccer legends Ronaldo and Kaka. When the carpet closed, I seized my chance to sneak through the crowd back into the reception. FIFA President Gianni Infantino (centre) with Ronaldo (left) and Kaka on the red carpet ahead of the World Cup draw. Credit: Getty Images Once inside, I helped myself to a glass of beetroot juice and tried to find the Australians. I looked for green and gold, kept my ears peeled for the accent, and inquired after anyone drinking a beer or hovering near the bar. Eventually, I heard it \u2013 that unmistakable Aussie twang. She turned out to be a Melburnian who now lives in Miami and works for FIFA. Apparently, only a handful of Australians were in attendance.\n\nInspecting my lanyard, she quickly clocked me for the imposter that I was. \u201cYou actually shouldn\u2019t even be in here,\u201d she said, pointing me towards \u2013 yep \u2013 the media centre. But I was feeling confident. As guests filed into the majestic theatre and had their tickets checked, I noticed people taking camera equipment through a separate entrance. I flashed my badge and waltzed right in. Andrea Bocelli performs the World Cup staple, Puccini\u2019s Nessun dorma. Credit: AP I ended up at the back of the hall with the photographers, just below the dress circle, where US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were seated with Infantino, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Proceedings began with a rousing rendition of Puccini\u2019s Nessun dorma by Andrea Bocelli, which everyone in the room filmed on their phones. Trump was the first in the dress circle to leap to his feet for a standing ovation, while Carney at one point seemed to shake his head in awe.\n\nIt turned out to be the highlight of the day. To say the draw was drawn out would be a grave understatement. FIFA naturally awarded its inaugural \u201cpeace prize\u201d \u2013 a bit of nonsense it invented to suck up to Trump, who gave the shortest and most modest speech I can remember him giving. Trump was awarded FIFA\u2019s inaugural \u201cpeace prize\u201d and quickly hung the medal around his neck. Credit: Getty Images It\u2019s one thing to hear Trump boast, dubiously, about ending eight wars; quite another to hear it from the head of FIFA. But Infantino knows there\u2019s no such thing as too much when it comes to stroking the president\u2019s ego. Somehow, that obsequious stunt wasn\u2019t even close to the most cringe part of the ceremony. That honour went to the awkward and painfully unfunny banter between hosts Kevin Hart and Heidi Klum, who never quite mastered the art of the teleprompter.\n\nAs the interminable videos and interviews piled up, the audience began to drift. By the time the pots appeared and the draw finally started, many people were scrolling on their phones. I snapped back to life during a playful bit when former basketballer Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2013 who makes even NFL legend Tom Brady look small \u2013 mercilessly toyed with the 5-foot-something Hart. Kevin Hart and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Credit: Getty Images The draw itself was suspenseful enough \u2013 if you\u2019re into that sort of thing \u2013 though, honestly, it felt like a meeting that could have been an email. Australia was grouped with the US, Paraguay and a yet-to-be-determined qualifier \u2013 which my colleague Vince Rugari says is \u201ca pretty good group for the Socceroos\u201d.\n\nThe ceremony ended with Village People performing Y.M.C.A. \u2013 another sop to Trump, who likes to end his major speeches with the camp classic. However, the band bungled their entrance, ambling on stage nearly 30 seconds after the musicians began playing. Trump performs his signature Y.M.C.A. dance at the FIFA World Cup draw. Credit: Getty Images The hiccup didn\u2019t stop Trump from breaking out his signature dance move and applauding with gusto as guests below filmed him with their phones. I also spotted him pointing out the Kennedy Centre\u2019s recent renovations to Carney and Sheinbaum. Back out in the post-draw reception, I sampled some dry chicken sliders and delicious fresh salmon with all the trimmings (dill, capers, red onion), while others popped open the Taittinger. Alas, I never did find the Australians.",

Verstappen was also noted by stewards for impeding Norris in the first flashpoint of the weekend after the champion had been fed wrong information by his race engineer, but they decided not to investigate further. Lando Norris and members of the McLaren team in Abu Dhabi. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWhat\u2019s this guy doing? I almost crashed,\u201d Norris had been left exclaiming. For Piastri, desperate for the pace he had in Qatar last weekend when only McLaren\u2019s strategy blunder stopped him sweeping every session, it felt a stop-start day as, first, he spent the morning on the team\u2019s pitwall.\n\nWhile Norris led Verstappen by 0.008sec in another one-two, he gave up his seat to reserve Pato O\u2019Ward in a session designed largely for young prospects and development drivers. Piastri was doubtless itching to get out on track as his McLaren boss Zak Brown joked: \u201cThere\u2019s some guy that has taken my seat!\u201d Not much of a laughing matter for Piastri, though, as he started on the back foot in the second session, more representative of what they\u2019ll all face on Sunday. He locked up on his quickest lap and couldn\u2019t get near Norris\u2019s fastest, with Brown noting: \u201cOscar is not totally dialled in yet but he will get there.\u201d\n\nPiastri certainly didn\u2019t seem concerned, appearing his usual unflappable self as he told reporters: \u201cFinding my feet. Clearly, some things to try and improve for tomorrow, but after just one session, not too bad. \u201cIt\u2019s more just little details, the car feels like it\u2019s in a pretty decent place, but just didn\u2019t get the grip out of it on that first soft lap. So some small tweaks for tomorrow, of course. It didn\u2019t feel perfect out there, but nothing major.\u201d Norris didn\u2019t evidently want to get too high himself so early in the week, saying: \u201cObviously, from the times, things look good at the minute, but I still want a bit more from the car. I\u2019m not completely happy, or completely confident. \u201cWe all know it gets a lot closer going into quali. So nothing to smile about just yet.\u201d Loading\n\nVerstappen had more than a few grumbles about the Friday set-up of his Red Bull, complaining in the morning that \u201csomething is broken on the car\u201d. Asked what the main areas of issue were by his race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, he replied: \u201cIt is everywhere now.\u201d Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, who could play a key role yet in Sunday\u2019s race, was third quickest in second practice. Brown elaborated on the prospect that McLaren might yet employ team orders in the race. Brown admitted: \u201cIf, as the race develops, it becomes clear one of our drivers has a significantly better chance than the other, then we\u2019re a team that wants to win the drivers\u2019 championship and we will race accordingly, to do whatever we can to get that driver in front to try and win the race.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cI was rebelling against everything,\u201d Gehry said in an interview with The New York Times in 2012, explaining his antipathy toward the dominant architectural movements of the time, as exemplified by the Farnsworth House on the Illinois prairie, a stark, flat, steel-and-glass modernist pavilion by Mies van der Rohe. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live in a house like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to come home, clean up my clothes, hang them properly. I thought it was snotty and effete. It just didn\u2019t feel like it fit into life.\u201d The Gehry-designed Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at UTS Business School in Sydney. Credit: Fairfax Media For some, his work was more sculpture than architecture. Others saw it as emblematic of a global culture that reduced architecture to a form of branding. Gehry, whose name was recognised around the world, was sometimes derided as a \u201cstar-chitect\u201d. But his work\u2019s emotional ferocity could feel empowering, as if architecture had rediscovered a part of itself that had been lost after decades of dreary functionalism and postmodernist cliches. And the widespread focus on his buildings\u2019 dazzling exteriors could distract from Gehry\u2019s deeper goals: to create an architecture that was not just affecting but democratic in spirit and evocative of the messiness of human life.\n\nHe was born Frank Owen Goldberg on February 28, 1929, in Toronto to Irving and Sadie (Caplan) Goldberg. His father held a series of jobs, including managing a grocery store and selling pinball and slot machines. Frank and his sister, Doreen, lived with their parents in a two-family house clad in brick and tar-paper shingles (a material he would use in some of his designs). As a boy, he worked part-time in his maternal grandfather\u2019s hardware store, stocking the shelves with tools, screws and bolts \u2013 an experience, he said, that spawned his love of everyday materials. The Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, another Gehry masterpiece, opened in 2003. Credit: Getty Images Once a week, his maternal grandmother would come home from the market with a live carp, another formative experience, which would inspire the fish imagery that later appeared in his work. \u201cWe\u2019d put it in the bathtub,\u201d Gehry recalled, \u201cand I\u2019d play with this fish for a day until she killed it and made gefilte fish\u201d (a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish). Frank\u2019s world abruptly fell apart in the mid-1940s, when his father, a heavy drinker, had a heart attack as the two were arguing on the front lawn, a memory that Gehry said haunted him for decades. His father never fully recovered. After a doctor warned that he would not survive another Toronto winter, the family moved to Los Angeles, renting a cramped $US50-a-month apartment in a run-down neighbourhood just west of downtown.\n\nAs an architect, Gehry was a late bloomer. After a brief stint in the army, he married Anita Snyder, who helped pay his way through the University of Southern California, where he initially studied ceramics. He shifted to architecture after a teacher introduced him to Raphael Soriano, a pillar of postwar modernism in Southern California. (It was around this time, too, that he adopted Gehry as his surname, a somewhat random choice inspired, he said, by the desire to avoid antisemitism.) Gehry spent several years toiling as a mid-level designer and project manager at Gruen Associates, a firm known for its shopping malls. After he opened his own office in 1962, much of his early work was for mainstream developers. He designed a sprawling headquarters for the Rouse Co. in Columbia, Maryland, and two unremarkable department stores for Joseph Magnin in California. \u2018You go into architecture to make the world a better place. A better place to live, to work, whatever. You don\u2019t go into it as an ego trip.\u2019 Frank Gehry, speaking in 2012 But he was an outsider by nature, and he began looking beyond the work of other architects for inspiration. Like many Angelenos, he was drawn to the laid-back, anything-goes atmosphere of the city, whose mix of garish mansions, flimsy bungalows, vacant lots, Googie\u2019s coffee shops and colourful billboards was the antithesis of East Coast architectural academicism. And he became close to a generation of Los Angeles artists \u2013 Robert Irwin, Billy Al Bengston, Ed Moses, Larry Bell \u2013 whose surfboard-inspired aesthetic and raw work spaces suggested an alternative to the chilly austerity of late modernism and the reactionary tendencies of postmodernism.\n\n\u201cThe artists were living in industrial buildings and warehouses,\u201d Gehry said in the 2012 interview with the Times. \u201cThey were constantly moving things around \u2013 changing the rooms, building lofts or storage spaces. It was so free and unselfconscious. I wanted to do that.\u201d In the late 1960s, Gehry and his wife divorced, and in 1975, he married Berta Aguilera. She survives him, along with their two sons, Sam, an architectural designer, and Alejandro, an artist; a daughter, Brina Gehry, from his previous marriage; and his sister, Doreen Gehry Nelson. Another daughter from his first marriage, Leslie Gehry Brenner, died in 2008. Gehry\u2019s approach to his own Santa Monica home divided critics \u2013 and his neighbours. Credit: wikipedia.org The Gehrys bought their Santa Monica house, a two-story pink-stucco affair, in 1977. At Aguilera\u2019s prodding, he began to tear it apart. The house\u2019s rough, unfinished appearance attracted the attention of architecture critics, even as it infuriated neighbours. But its tormented forms \u2013 suggesting a world that had been ripped up and gently pieced back together \u2013 had their own kind of beauty. And the use of crude, everyday materials was Gehry\u2019s assertion that the working-class aesthetic he had grown up with could be as appealing as anything found in the more refined corners of the city.\n\nDecades later, he and Aguilera moved out of the little house that had first brought him fame and into a more luxurious spread overlooking Santa Monica Canyon. Designed with his son Sam, the new house was a sprawling, sometimes awkward composition of angled, heavy-timber posts and beams. Nonetheless, it retained some of the rough-and-tumble qualities of Gehry\u2019s earlier architecture, and its jostling forms reflected a lifelong quest for emotional and creative freedom. Gehry kept on working. An interior view of Gehry\u2019s Luma Foundation building in Arles, France. Credit: Getty Images In 2017, he completed the Pierre Boulez Hall in Berlin, designed in collaboration with conductor Daniel Barenboim: a compact, box-like space with a sunken floor and a floating elliptical balcony, contained inside an austere neo-classical building from the 1950s. And in 2021, the Luma Foundation building in Arles, in southern France, was finished; a twisting tower of stainless-steel bricks, it was inspired, in part, by the rocky terrain of the nearby Alpilles mountain range. At his death, Gehry was completing several projects for luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, including an 7618-square-metre flagship store for Louis Vuitton in Beverly Hills, California, and, in Paris, the conversion of an abandoned 1960s building into an exhibition space and events hall down the block from Arnault\u2019s Fondation Louis Vuitton building. He was also putting the final touches on a 1000-seat concert hall for the Colburn School of Music, near his Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.",

        "text": "Loading Wests Tigers Rugby League Football Club Pty Ltd is a voting member of ARLC and a licensee of the NRL, entitling it to participate in the NRL competition. Wests Tigers first participated under that licence in 2000. Before that time, there were the Balmain Tigers and the Western Suburbs Magpies; creatures hardly known for living in harmony in the wild. Each is a foundation rugby league club with a storied history. Wests Tigers\u2019 membership of ARLC, and its licence agreement tethering it to the NRL, are interdependent - if the licence agreement is axed, the membership of ARLC cuts out too, and vice versa. Wests Tigers is a company with two shareholders: Balmain Tigers Rugby League Football Club Limited, and Wests Magpies Pty Limited. But this is where things unravel.\n\nThe internal governance of Wests Tigers isn\u2019t a democracy, or anything close to it. Balmain holds 1,000,020 Class A ordinary shares in Wests Tigers; Wests Magpies holds quadruple that number. Wests Magpies owns 80 per cent of the total share equity and voting rights in Wests Tigers. But it wasn\u2019t always that way, as you discover once you examine the history books (and the ASIC registers). Back in the simpler times of 1999, when the Magpies/Tigers arranged marriage was forged \u2013 with the spectre of extinction hovering \u2013 the union at least was an equal one. No more. Sustained financial calamities, striking with dreadful regularity throughout the last quarter-century, have manifested in the renegotiation of arrangements and the destruction of any semblance of balance in what\u2019s now a husk of a \u201cjoint\u201d venture.\n\nThe control of the Balmain and Wests Magpies shareholders is curiouser still. Balmain\u2019s governance is unremarkable in a sporting club sense; the company is in the control of its members. Wests Magpies is fundamentally different. It has two shareholders: Western Suburbs Leagues Club Limited and Western Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club Limited. There\u2019s three shares on issue in Wests Magpies: an A Class share, a B Class share and a C Class. Wests Leagues holds the A Class and B Class shares, Wests Football holds the C Class, but Wests Leagues exerts control over Wests Football regardless. Complicated, much? Wests Tigers is supposed to be governed by a nine-person board that includes \u201cindependent\u201d directors. The concept of being a member of a football club connotes having a democratic say in things. Conversely, that\u2019s not really how the Wests Tigers structure operates. And it seems nobody really values any independent thinkers and doers there.\n\nIn line with the unequal shareholdings, Wests Magpies has the power to appoint many more directors to Wests Tigers than Balmain can. But a different problem exists, in terms of how Wests Magpies itself makes decisions. West Magpies is a registered club, governed by both the Corporations Act and the Registered Clubs Act. The latter legislation prescribes the classes of members a registered club can have, and other internal governance rules. Like most registered clubs, there\u2019s thousands of members. But a bizarre quirk of the Wests Magpies structure, is that the majority of power rests with a cohort of 20 \u201cdebenture\u201d holders, who\u2019ve (apparently) lent the club $100 at an interest rate of six per cent, in consideration for enjoying entry into the inner cabal that effectively controls Wests Magpies in terms of director appointments. It\u2019s those 20 lenders, who control four-fifths of the voting strength of Wests Tigers, and the NRL franchise itself. Democratic? Hardly. But there are other issues here as well. Clause 47.1 of the Wests Tigers constitution says the company shall have a maximum of nine directors.\n\nLoading The appointment, removal and replacement of the directors is to occur in accordance with the company\u2019s shareholder agreement and other instruments. The word \u201cindependent\u201d is used no less than 55 times across the Wests Tigers\u2019 constitution and shareholders agreement. There\u2019s even an entire schedule that defines what the term means. Clause 4.11(g)(ii) of the shareholders agreement, governing the relationship between the Wests Tigers\u2019 shareholders, casts material doubt on whether shareholders (not just Wests Magpies) can effectively give notice to remove an \u201cindependent director\u201d as classified by the documents. Clause 4.11(g)(i) permits a shareholder who appointed a non-independent director to remove that director. Clause 4.11(g)(ii) requires notice from both shareholders AND National Rugby League Limited, to remove an independent director.\n\nWhich then leads to this question: which of Charlie Viola, Michelle McDowell, Annabelle Williams and Barry O\u2019Farrell are the \u201cindependent directors\u201d for the purpose of the Wests\n\nTigers governance documents? Those documents, in places, contemplate there being two independent directors. If there are only two directors of the four that, by proper definition, are the \u201cindependent directors\u201d, legal questions exist about the proper basis for Wests Magpies\u2019 belief that it, as the majority shareholder, can act alone. Wests Tigers CEO Shane Richardson. Credit: Oscar Colman Those questions need answers, before the Wests Tigers descend further. Whether O\u2019Farrell or anyone else would bother torching money seeking Supreme Court injunctions about this stuff is hypothetical \u2013 who\u2019d want to risk further damage to their reputation by seeking to stay in the tent? But assuming that Wests Magpies can issue a notice to remove an independent director, where that notice has proper legal effect, that then leads back to the fundamental question as to why anyone would want to be an independent director at all.",

        "text": "Imagine being turned away from bars, clubs, and venues for simply moving through a crowd the only way you safely can.\n\nThat\u2019s the reality for Sydney man Daniel Leighton, 36, who lives with Retinitis Pigmentosa.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo, he explained that the experience happens far too often.\n\n\"I was born with a hearing loss, and as I hit puberty, I started to lose my peripheral vision,\" Daniel said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"I remember not ever being able to see well in low-light conditions, and then slowly I started losing more periphery until, by my 30s, it was basically gone.\n\n\"Now I just have a very narrow field of view, like a tunnel vision sort of situation.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no treatment yet. Glasses don\u2019t help, and stem cell research overseas hasn\u2019t reached human trials.\n\nSo Daniel navigates the world with what vision he still has, and in crowded social settings, that comes with added challenges.\n\nDaniel lives with Retinitis Pigmentosa, a condition that causes gradual vision loss, especially in low-light settings. Source: Supplied\n\nBars, clubs, and music venues are the toughest. Daniel rarely uses his cane in packed environments because of their size.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Moving that around on the ground in large groups of people isn\u2019t going to tell me anything. It\u2019ll just tell me there are people all around me.\u201d\n\nInstead, he places a hand on a friend\u2019s shoulder \u2014 the only way he can safely move through tight crowds with low light and uneven footing.\n\nDo you have a story? Contact newsroomau@yahoonews.com\n\nBut to security staff, that often looks like someone who's unsteady on their feet.\n\n\"Bars and anywhere there\u2019s drinking is notoriously bad,\" Daniel said.\n\n\"I personally don\u2019t drink. If I buy a four-pack of pre-mixes, that\u2019ll last me a fortnight. But when I go to bars, I might have a drink or two. I\u2019ve shown up, not even walked up to the bar, and I\u2019ve been asked to leave because they think I\u2019m intoxicated when it\u2019s clearly not the case.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOnce security makes that call, Daniel says it\u2019s almost impossible to change their minds, even when he produces a pass confirming he's visually impaired.\n\n\"Sometimes they won\u2019t even listen to the issue. They\u2019ll just say, 'I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve only had one drink,' and then it's, 'you don\u2019t have to go home, but you can\u2019t stay here.'\"\n\nDaniel attends gigs multiple times a month, at crowded venues and in chaotic mosh pits, all while living with low vision.

We used to go home,\" he said. \"It feels pretty sh*tty. But my mates are such good friends \u2014 we just blacklist that place and never go back.\"\n\nDaniel's experience is far from isolated.\n\nVision Australia says many people with low vision describe similar treatment from bouncers, bar staff, and venue security.\n\nFocus groups conducted by the organisation found attendees consistently felt misunderstood and unsupported, often leaving events early or avoiding them altogether.\n\nDaniel's experience reveals a bigger issue at play\n\nChris Edwards, General Manager of Corporate Affairs and Advocacy at Vision Australia, said these incidents reveal a broader problem.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Music and concerts play an important role in social inclusion and cultural participation. People with a disability have a right to enjoy these events with their peers. However, mishandling by venue staff can easily derail this,\" he said.\n\n\"While increased lighting, large print signage, audio announcements and audio description are important accessibility features at all events, this needs to be effectively communicated to patrons.\"\n\nEdwards says accessibility isn\u2019t just about physical design \u2014 though improved lighting, clear signage, audio announcements and audio description help \u2014 but about communication and awareness.\n\n\"Well-trained staff can bridge gaps in design and respond to individual needs in real time to support accessibility,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVision Australia is urging venues to brief staff on accessibility features, companion seating options, inclusive language, and the location of ramps, lifts, and viewing areas.\n\nDimly lit concert venues are particularly tough for him, but the biggest challenges go beyond environmental hurdles. Source: Supplied\n\nThey also recommend assigning a clear point of contact for accessibility queries and encouraging the use of both verbal and non-verbal communication when assisting patrons.\n\nDaniel believes the solution is simultaneously simple and overlooked.\n\n\"It\u2019s got to be awareness and a little bit of empathy,\" he said. \"Yes, as security or a bouncer, that is your job, but a little bit of sensitivity and awareness is probably the main thing that needs to happen.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe also wants the public to understand that vision loss doesn\u2019t always look the way people assume.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is just how varied it can be. Just because someone\u2019s blind doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have any perception,\" he said.\n\n\"If you saw me out in public with a friend and not with my cane, I don\u2019t think most people would pick it up. I can see what\u2019s directly in front of me.\n\n\"I make good eye contact. Every person\u2019s blindness or disability is different, even if it\u2019s the same condition.\"\n\nDespite the setbacks, Daniel keeps showing up. The music scene, especially metal and punk, gives him the sense of community he wishes security guards could see.\n\nFor him, accessibility isn\u2019t about rules. It\u2019s about belonging.\n\nDo you have a story tip? Email: newsroomau@yahoonews.com.\n\nYou can also follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube.",
