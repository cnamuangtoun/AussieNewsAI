        "text": "Analysis: The Optus network outage that occurred on September 18 this year led to a failure of hundreds of Triple Zero calls, and tragically two deaths where people had attempted to make Triple Zero calls.\n\nYesterday's independent report, released by Optus, is a complex analysis of the incident which will lead to changes in the handling of network upgrades, communications within Optus, but most alarmingly, shines a light on a serious issue with our modern mobile-reliant communications systems and the Triple Zero emergency line.\n\nLeaving aside the analysis of the technical \"why\" surrounding the network outage, and understanding that there will be plenty of people at Optus looking at potentially packing their bags after failures to escalate the problem and properly communicate the issues, the real focus, I think, should be on educating Australians about the learnings we can all take from this issue.\n\nREAD MORE: Official Christmas Day forecast revealed\n\nAn independent report released by Optus shines a light on a serious issue with our modern mobile-reliant communications systems. (Getty)\n\nOn the very first page of the over 40-page report produced by Dr Kerry Schott AO, there is a reference to mobile devices possibly taking \"40 to 60 seconds to camp-on,\" which is the technical term for your mobile finding an alternate network to make a Triple Zero call in the event of an outage.\n\nCalls to Optus' customer support on the day of the outage reported this exact problem; customers had tried to call Triple Zero but heard nothing but complete silence.\n\nA key recommendation of the Schott report is to \"Inform all customers that their devices may take 40-60 seconds to connect to Triple Zero\" - that is a staggering thing to hear, as Dr Schott points out, \"In an emergency, people are unlikely to hang on for this length of time, especially when the only response they are getting is silence on the line.\"\n\nCritically, there is no single way in which mobile phones operate in the event of an outage to process a request to call Triple Zero.\n\nOptus testing showed that Apple and Samsung phones used different pathways to establish a route through to another network and ultimately to Triple Zero.\n\nMost concerning might also be the analysis which showed both Apple and Samsung devices attempted to connect to 3G to make that call, despite the fact that 3G has been switched off in Australia for over a year now.\n\nGiven this 40 to 60 second delay, it can be assumed that part of that timeframe is used to attempt 3G connections, and that should be written completely out of the code for devices used in Australia.\n\nREAD MORE: How everyday Aussies can help in the wake of the Bondi shooting\n\nMost alarmingly, the report shines a light on a serious issue with our modern mobile-reliant communications systems and the Triple Zero emergency line. (Getty)\n\nPerhaps problematically, removing that code might then render the phones unable to contact emergency numbers in other countries when travelling, which is also an issue for travellers coming to Australia with phones still hard-coded to use 3G for emergency services.\n\nThe Schott report recommends that the industry and Government investigate ways to make the Triple Zero system be data-enabled, which would remove this reliance on now-old, outdated, and discontinued mobile network concepts.\n\nConcerningly, the report also recommends that the public be encouraged to test their devices to ensure they work for a Triple Zero call.\n\nIt is vital that the public never call Triple Zero unless it is an emergency; in fact, it's an offence to do so.\n\nWhat is needed though is a system by which people can have faith that their phone will work in the unique circumstances of a network failure, something you can't test by simply making a call.\n\nIndustry testing of devices must continue; a phone or SMS number should be set up for people to contact to validate their device, and the regulators and Government must act fast to bring our Triple Zero emergency call network up to a modern global standard.\n\nWhile not noted in the Schott report, this could and should include factors such as calls via satellite, SMS, and messaging connectivity to Triple Zero and a modern data-enabled call system; it's the least we should expect from the most important phone number in Australia.",

        "text": "Australian Test great Jason Gillespie has slammed England after the team once again sent an assistant coach out to speak to the media after a poor day three of the third Ashes Test at Adelaide Oval.\n\nSpin coach Jateen Patel spoke after a day's play that saw Australia dominate with bat and ball, suggesting that people outside the English camp had built up this Ashes series to be more than it is.\n\nFollow live: All the action from day four of the third Ashes Test at Adelaide Oval\n\n\"I think the narrative of [the Ashes] being the series is everyone else's story,\" Patel said.\n\n\"But we're out here to try and win a series against Australia and take away the Ashes.\n\n\"We've got a lot of work [to do] to get there to do that. We had a lot of work to do from the start. It hasn't gone our way so far. We've got a huge mission in the next couple of days, but, I mean, this team has done some amazing things before.\"\n\nThe comment directly contradicted the thoughts of head coach Brendon McCullum.\n\n\"He's a proper \u00adcricketer,\" McCullum said in September while talking about Jofra Archer.\n\n\"Hence why we've taken our time with him to make sure that we give him every chance to be in the biggest series of all of our lives.\"\n\nSpeaking on ABC Sport, Gillespie said it was a \"nonsense\" approach.\n\n\"Nonsense. Plain and simple. That was just nonsense,\" Gillespie said.\n\n\"It completely contradicts what the head coach has said, [the] biggest series of our lives, and then [Patel's] playing it down.\n\n\"It didn't make any sense to me.\"\n\nThe former Australian quick said it was a sign that tension was building in an English camp on the brink of losing the Ashes and going down 3-0 after three Tests.\n\n\"I'm just hearing excuse after excuse after excuse from this England side,\" Gillespie said.\n\nMichael Vaughan and Jason Gillespie walk out with the Ashes Crystal replica before the start of the Adelaide Test. (Getty Images: Sarah Reed)\n\n\"They're feeling the heat, there's no doubt about it. Sending out assistant coaches to speak to the media, no players, no head coach, no captain. All is not well in that camp.\"\n\nEnglish cricket pundit Jonathan Agnew said there had been a string of different staff members fronting the media and that England was running out of options.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing who England put out tonight for the interview because so far we've had the bowling coach, David Saker, then we had the assistant coach, Marcus Trescothick, then we had the spin bowling coach last night, Jeetan Patel, the New Zealander,\" Agnew said.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"I'm not sure what remains in there. They're obviously reluctant to put a player out. I'm going for the bus driver, I think he's due. Let's get his thoughts on the Ashes.\"\n\nAgnew said he felt sorry for the coaches who had to speak to the media in place of the coach and the players.\n\n\"I feel sorry [for them]. You've [Gillespie] been there as a coach trying to defend the indefensible and you hear them stand up and say quite silly things like, 'Will Jacks bowled quite tidily there'. Well, he went for six an over. It's impossible for the coach to get wheeled out there and defend stuff.\n\n\"The head coach is responsible, he's the man who calls the shots, he makes the decisions. But the assistants, they can't come out and say Bazball is a load of nonsense.\n\n\"But the bus driver doesn't necessarily [have to toe the party line] so let's hear what he has to say.\"",

        "text": "New Perth Glory coach Adam Griffiths doesn't want to talk about mountain goats any more.\n\nTwo weeks ago his post-match press conference went viral, when he delivered a one-minute monologue on those most sure-footed of mammals, before telling the media: \"I am a lion.\"\n\nThe meaning, he says, is in the ear of the beholder.\n\n\"It's something for the person to absorb and take for whatever they want,\" he tells the ABC of the aside ahead of this weekend's clash with Adelaide United.\n\nProposed interpretations and a suggestion he took inspiration from football legend Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, who has similarly referred to himself as a lion, are met with a swift \"no\".\n\nWhatever the meaning, Griffiths' bemusing analogy has stirred up interest in a team and league that have long struggled for viewers.\n\nAdam Griffiths led Perth Glory to three consecutive victories for the first time since 2021. (Supplied: Perth Glory)\n\nAfter David Zdrilic's dismissal in October \u2014 Glory's sixth coach in eight years \u2014 many fans were ready to throw in the towel.\n\nBut in less than two months under Griffiths, the team is finally showing a bit of spark, managing to string together three consecutive wins for the first time since 2021.\n\nGlory's Tarantino\n\nGiven his flair for the dramatic, it's perhaps unsurprising to learn Griffiths has dabbled in filmmaking throughout his life, directing several short films and commercials.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC, he suggests off-the-cuff that he's Perth Glory's Quentin Tarantino, though his favourite director is Stanley Kubrick.\n\nIt's the kind of cryptic deadpan comment he's become known for in recent months, building his reputation as one of the more interesting figures in the A-League landscape.\n\nAdam Griffiths has brought a new resolve to Perth Glory, who have spent years in the doldrums. (ABC News: Bridget McArthur)\n\nHe no longer uses social media \u2014 which he sees as a distraction \u2014 and is a relative enigma online, leaving fans (and reporters) to dig through interview archives for hints.\n\nIn an interview on Malaysian television from 2013, a less confident but similarly maverick Griffiths says if he could wish for anything it would be to be a vampire and live forever.\n\nFootball as art\n\nOther bits and pieces are briefly illuminated in conversation, including that Griffiths paints and, once upon a time, founded a machine learning company.\n\nBut he isn't interested in elaborating.\n\nSocceroos fans hunt for tickets despite 'extortionate' prices Australia are among the countries with the most ticket requests for next year's World Cup, which is bound to please Socceroos coach Tony Popovic and his team.\n\nPrevious exploits \u2014 about which he says, tantalisingly, he could write \"multiple books [and] probably a few films\" \u2014 are firmly in the rear view, with all hobbies and interests external to football apparently on pause.\n\n\"Football is all consuming,\" he says.\n\n\"I love it and I'm 100 per cent focused on that.\"\n\nAccording to Griffiths, sport can also be a form of artistic expression.\n\n\"Football has that element of creativity and you can take different pieces and turn it into something beautiful or ugly or fascinating,\" he says.\n\nA shift in strategy\n\nGrowing up in Sydney's outer suburbs, Griffiths first fell in love with football aged five when his dad \u2014 a first grade cricketer and footballer \u2014 took him and his twin Joel and younger brother Ryan to a game.\n\nAll three ended up playing soccer professionally though he says personality-wise they couldn't be more different, describing himself \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 as \"the ledge\" (aka legend) of the trio.\n\nNewly appointed Perth Glory head coach Adam Griffiths (right), posing with Glory CEO Anthony Radich. (AAP Image/Supplied: Perth Glory)\n\nWhen he finished up as a player, Griffiths turned to coaching.\n\n\"[I] fell in love again, but just in a different aspect, probably more so the tactical, the decision-making,\" he says.\n\nMatildas coach calls out Australian football's 'inferiority complex' Joe Montemurro echoes the words of former Matildas boss Alen Stajcic in offering a frank review of the culture surrounding the world game in Australia.\n\nZdrilic's dismissal in October afforded him his first chance to take the reins, promoted from assistant to interim coach after just two games with the club, and he was this week offered a contract until at least the end of the season.\n\nThe 46-year-old says he had a clear idea of how he wanted to lead from the get-go.\n\n\"My approach as soon as I came in was to give clear messaging, identify the leaders within the group, have the players buy into a playing style that they want to play for and want to love, which is what I love,\" he says.\n\nGriffiths defines this style as \"possession-based attacking football with a solid defensive structure\" \u2014 a shift in approach quickly apparent on field, with more possession, more opportunities going forward, and fewer goals conceded.\n\nGriffiths says understanding the strengths and motivations of every player is also key.\n\nAdam Griffiths with Perth Glory defender Charbel Shamoon. (Getty Images)\n\n\"Every human is different so [I] make sure I connect with the individual on their specific level and then try to find the best thing to get the best out of those players,\" he says.\n\nAccording to Glory defender Charbel Shamoon, who recently scored his first A-League goal under Griffiths, it's working.\n\n\"Ever since 'Griff' took over he gave us this real belief, changed the way we played and changed the ways we just thought mentally every single day and it helped us,\" he says.\n\nFowler claims French teammate gave her bananas instead of flowers Socceroos star Mary Fowler has shared her experiences of depression and self-harm, as well as racism from her teammates, that she endured during her time with Montpellier.\n\n\"Those three wins in a row wasn't just luck. He's really built a good belief in the team and we're all really excited to play under him.\"\n\nAnd while Griffiths may be sick of talking about it, Shamoon says the players couldn't get enough of his mountain goat interview.\n\n\"I've got no clue [what it means] but I like it,\" he says.\n\n\"I like something different, character.\"\n\nIt's hard to miss the movie-made narrative bubbling beneath the surface \u2014 Griffiths taking the Glory from consecutive wooden spooners to finals would be the ultimate underdog story.\n\n\"That is the only thing on my mind \u2014 to achieve success with this team at whatever cost.

        "text": "For most travellers visiting Western Australia, the pristine white sand beaches of the south or the breathtaking gorges of the north top the bucket list.\n\nBut for Frenchman Bruno Vincent, the inland city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 600 kilometres east of Perth, was top priority.\n\nMr Vincent is a gold prospector from the French medieval city of Dole, 370 kilometres south-east of Paris.\n\nHe is travelling in Australia with his daughter Valentine Vincent on a once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nValentine Vincent says the city is important to her father. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner)\n\nMs Vincent said the visit to WA's gold city was extremely important to her father.\n\n\"For him [Kalgoorlie] is a really important town, he really wanted to come here,\" she said.\n\nA different kind of prospecting\n\nUsing his daughter as a translator, Mr Vincent explained he started prospecting when he was 20 after meeting a man in a river panning for gold.\n\n\"I asked him, 'What are you doing?', and he explained. Then we became friends,\" he said.\n\nThe hobby took over Mr Vincent's life for the next 40 years.\n\nA younger Mr Vincent (far left) prospects in a river in France. (Supplied: Bruno Vincent)\n\nHe went on to start a prospecting association and a school holiday camp for children to try their hand at it.\n\n\"[We] really wanted to share this passion,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Australia, French gold prospecting rarely uses a metal detector.\n\nInstead, Mr Vincent said prospectors study the lay of rivers and used pans to locate gold.\n\nMr Vincent prospects in the rivers surrounding his home city of Dole in eastern France. (Supplied: Bruno Vincent)\n\n\"Mostly we use the eyes and the knowledge, and mostly we are prospecting with the pan,\" he said.\n\nAlso unlike Australia, Mr Vincent said most of the gold found in the French rivers was like \"dust\",' and flowed down the mountains from Switzerland's Alps.\n\n\"In France, you cannot find a lot of nuggets; it's just more like powder,\" he said.\n\n\"The quantity of gold is massive here, compared to France. The gold in France is too small to be detected by the detector.\"\n\nIt is this scarcity that makes it so special to Mr Vincent.\n\n\" Because the gold in France is really rare, and also really hard to find, it's really precious for us. \"\n\nHopes for local connection\n\nMs Vincent said she had reached out to the Kalgoorlie community on Facebook, hoping a local could show her father the ins and outs of Australian prospecting.\n\nShe said her father had no interest in finding and keeping Aussie gold and just wanted to learn the techniques used here.\n\nBruno and Valentine Vincent visited the Museum of the Goldfields to learn more about the area's gold prospecting history. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner)\n\n\"We really wanted to share this moment with a local, but we didn't have the chance to do that.\"\n\nOperations coordinator at Kalgoorlie Tourism Sarah Shepherd said there had been a definite uptick in gold tourists like Mr Vincent in 2025.\n\n\"Since the gold price has gone up, there's definitely a lot more people,\" she said.\n\n\"We get a lot of Europeans wanting to do gold prospecting, and people from Asian countries as well.\"\n\nSarah Shepherd says many visitors at this time of year are Europeans escaping the cold weather. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner)\n\nMs Shepherd said it was important that people who wanted to try their hand at prospecting did not go alone.\n\n\"Go out with an experienced prospector and take more water than you think you will need, and also have an EPIRB [emergency beacon] with you.\"\n\nDespite the lack of prospecting, Mr Vincent said he had enjoyed his time in the Goldfields.\n\n\"The gold is a dream for every man, and particularly for me,\" he said.\n\nWhile Ms Vincent had not quite caught the prospecting bug from her father, she said it meant a lot that she got to spend time with him.\n\n\"He shared his hobby and his passion when we were kids. I have really great memories prospecting in the river with him,\" she said.\n\n\"So I'm really happy to share this moment here in this city with him, because I know it's his dream.\"",

        "text": "When real estate agent Ursula Watson joined the profession four years ago, she never imagined the Darwin property market would be as fiercely competitive as it has been in 2025.\n\nWith a large contact book of property-hungry interstate buyers' agents, Ms Watson said many homes can now be sold before they ever get listed on the market.\n\n\"It's pretty competitive when it comes to owner-occupiers and first home buyers,\" Ms Watson said.\n\n\" It's a bit of a struggle for them at the moment because obviously they're being outbought by the investors. \"\n\nUrsula Watson says its a tough market for first home buyers, when they are competing with big investors. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nIn the first half of this year, interstate investors were increasingly turning to the NT to snap up some of the country's most affordable homes.\n\nDecember data from property research firm Cotality shows Darwin house prices grew by 17 per cent this year, a larger increase than any other capital city by far.\n\nHome values rose by 1.9 per cent in November, accelerating from October's 1.6 per cent increase.\n\nDespite the rapid growth, Darwin's median dwelling value remains the lowest of Australian capital cities at $578,871.\n\nMarket analysts attribute the growth to consistent rental yields, which are holding steady at 6.3 per cent in Darwin.\n\nIt's a figure analysts say will continue to drive strong demand from interstate investors, drawn in by attractive financials.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of increase in investment activity as well as some good fundamentals like a decent increase in jobs growth over the past year,\" Cotality head of research Eliza Owen said.\n\n\"I think for an investor Darwin looks very good on paper,\" Ms Owen said.\n\nPalmerston house prices have surged by 24 per cent this year, the biggest annual increase in the country for areas of comparable size. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nMs Owen said the number of loans approved for the purchase of investment properties shows the true scale of the competition faced by Darwin locals hoping to buy a home.\n\n\"Over the past five years, we've seen an average of about 190 loans per quarter secured for investment property purchases in the NT. In the year to June that ballooned to 430 loans this quarter,\" she said.\n\nWhile Ms Owen expected the growth to continue in the short-term, she said there were some \"headwinds gathering\" that could temper further growth next year.\n\n\"What happens is that you might get more and more investors crowding into this market until it stops delivering the same capital growth or until it stops delivering the same rent yield, which compresses as values rise.\"\n\nEliza Owen says gathering headwinds could temper growth in the Darwin property market next year. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nShe said you only needed to look at historical data to see Darwin's property market was characterised by \"very strong, cyclical movements\".\n\nPredictions of an impending price correction are shared by Domain's senior economist, Joel Bowman, who said competition would remain tight until some buyers started to get priced out of the market in the latter half of next year.\n\n\"We're expecting strong price momentum to continue during the first half of next year before conditions will start to cool during the second half, as affordability constraints really start to bite,\" he said.\n\nJoel Bowman says first home buyers should broaden their horizons to include suburbs further afield. (Supplied)\n\nWhile Dr Bowman agreed strong interstate investor activity in Darwin had driven prices up, he said the phenomenon was not unique and had \"largely played out in a lot of other capital cities as well\".\n\nMs Watson, however, did offer some advice for first home buyers in Darwin \"feeling out-priced by what's been going on in the market\".\n\n\"My suggestion to them is to broaden their search to other suburbs as well.\"",

        "text": "The Gascoyne town of Carnarvon is known as the food bowl of Western Australia for its fresh produce, and now non-profit organisation Foodbank is hoping it may be part of a solution to address food security.\n\nThe organisation is working directly with local growers to identify if excess produce which may go to waste could be transported 800 kilometres south to Perth for distribution across its 70 sites.\n\nFoodbank sourcing coordinator Angela Tarbottom recently visited the region and said there had been positive conversations with key local people.\n\n\"It seems like a partnership between Perth and Carnarvon, and that bit in between, is going to be really important for everyone, especially people in Carnarvon,\" Ms Tarbottom said.\n\nShe said she was keen to see what that could look like in the future.\n\nLocal growers Cindy Glynn and Garry Brown support the idea. (ABC Pilbara: Rachel Hagan)\n\nLocal mango growers Garry Brown and Cindy Glynn said up to 30 per cent of their mangoes do not reach market because of minor skin imperfections.\n\n\"Nothing wrong with the fruit, so a big portion of that would be able to be repurposed,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\" It's good that can go to a good cause and to people who really need it. \"\n\nGrowers ready to give, but need more help\n\nLocal grower Phill Frzop was a part of the first trial of produce from Carnarvon to Perth. (ABC Pilbara: Rachel Hagan)\n\nThe first trial has taken place with a bin of eggplant from local Carnarvon grower Phill Frzop sent to Perth.\n\nHowever, he had concerns around future logistics.\n\n\"If it's coordinated then I can't see why we can't do it more regularly,\" Mr Frzop said.\n\n\"I think Foodbank themselves have got to get out there and get a coordinator, and we need transport who's going to ship it.\n\n\"Then the product that's harvested has got to be refrigerated because it's all a perishable product.\"\n\nEddie Smith says he is concerned about the logistics involved in transporting the produce to Perth. (ABC Pilbara: Rachel Hagan)\n\nLocal grower Eddie Smith used to donate his excess mangoes to Foodbank in Geraldton but said the partnership was cancelled when transport failed.\n\n\"I think the logistics of Foodbank setting up here could be problematic because of the tyranny of distance and labour costs,\" Mr Smith said.\n\n\"Everything has got to be voluntary so I'm not sure how that would work.\"\n\nMr Smith said he had already donated about 200 kilograms of mangoes to a local business which provided the containers and collected the donation.\n\nWhat about Carnarvon?\n\nFoodbank has no distribution sites in the north-west of the state but Kylie Coniglio volunteers at a number of local organisations for those in need in Carnarvon.\n\nShe said she witnessed families living below the poverty line who needed food every day.\n\nKylie Coniglio wants to see help for people in Carnarvon who are also struggling. (ABC Pilbara: Rachel Hagan)\n\nShe estimated many of those families would eat only one meal a day.\n\n\"We have little kids who go to school hungry. Sometimes [they] may not be fortunate enough to have a meal the night before,\" Ms Coniglio said.\n\n\"That's just sad.\"\n\nMs Coniglio she would like to see Foodbank, or another organisation, operating locally.\n\n\"If there is an option to keep it [excess produce donations] here in Carnarvon to give to our community, then why is no-one doing it?\" she said.\n\nStephanie Godrich says Carnarvon would benefit from a food action group to help coordinate food relief. (Supplied)\n\nEdith Cowan University nutrition lecturer Stephanie Godrich said food insecurity had far-reaching effects with children exhibiting poorer physical and mental health into adulthood.\n\n\"They might develop depression, anxiety or behavioural issues, especially children when they are at school. They have less opportunity to learn,\" Ms Godrich said.\n\nIn addition to poor mental health, she said food insecurity can be intergenerational and lead to higher chronic disease rates.\n\nDr Godrich said a local food action group bringing together government, community organisations and local businesses could be the answer, but required funding.\n\nFoodbank's 2025 Hunger Report states one in three Australian households has experienced food insecurity in the last year, with 20 per cent of people having skipped a meal or gone days without eating.",

(ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nLiberals retain power as no-confidence motion defeated \u2014 as it happened Tasmanian Labor fails to unseat Liberal premier Jeremy Rockliff with not a single crossbencher voting for their no-confidence motion.\n\nBoth Labor and the Greens have raised concerns about the taxpayer-funded advertising, which were both extensions of an almost $39,000 advertising spend with Pulse.\n\nThat spend, dated May 27, consisted of an advertorial on Pulse's Facebook and Instagram to promote the budget, plus a full digital takeover, giving the government a \"100 per cent share of voice\" on Pulse's website.\n\nAsked how he justified the spend given he had already asked for an election to be called, Mr Rockliff said it was the \"government's responsibility to inform the community after a budget\" about what was contained in it, including its measures to ease the cost of living.\n\n\"The governor made the decision to allow an election on June 11th, and that's when the advertising stopped,\" he said.\n\n\"The government went into caretaker on June 12th.\"\n\nBut Shadow Attorney-General Ella Haddad said Mr Rockliff had serious questions to answer about the two later advertising spends, particularly the June 11 payment, claiming the premier and his office knew Tasmanians were heading to an election when it was authorised.\n\n\"It is extraordinarily questionable for a government to be pouring tens of thousands of dollars of public money into political-style advertising when it knows an election is imminent,\" Ms Haddad said.\n\n\" Tasmanians rightly expect government advertising to be used to convey essential information, not crowd out debate from a digital space at the very moment an election campaign begins. \"\n\nElla Haddad describes the payments to Pulse as \"extraordinarily questionable\". (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nGreens MP Vica Bayley said the payments looked \"pretty smelly\".\n\n\"At face value, this is a misuse of taxpayer funds; it is utterly inappropriate to be taking out advertorials when it comes to promoting the government at a time where it was collapsing or where we were in an election campaign,\" he said.\n\n\"This was funding, it seemed, was pitched to promote the budget, irrespective of the fact the budget was clearly destined to fail, and then clearly parliament was prorogued and an election was held.\n\n\" This is taxpayer money. We all know the budget is tight \u2014 every single dollar counts. That [total Pulse spend of] $50,000 could have been used in myriad other ways. \"\n\nMr Bayley said it was \"clear the premier has questions to answer here\".",

He assessed it for big cracks and large specks on the surface.\n\n\"It's not just a case of landing a boat and then looking for granite. There's a particular type of granite we're looking for,\" he said in the shadow of a 19th century lighthouse that is no longer manned.\n\n\"We look for ones that have got really tight surface pattern.\"\n\nThe common green granite comprising the body of the stone is found on one end, and the blue hone granite that forms the running surface is on the other side of the \" craggy ocean pyramid \" as poet John Keats described the island more than a century before the first Winter Games.\n\nThe island of Ailsa Craig, where the two types of granite, Common Green and Blue Hone, that are used to make curling stones is quarried from. (AP Photo: Alastair Grant)\n\nKays, which has made all the curling stones for the Milan Cortina Winter Games, has a history with the Olympics dating back to the first winter edition \u2014 1924 in Chamonix, France.\n\nThe curling competition at those games was long thought to have been an exhibition event but eventually was confirmed as official. The company has continued to make stones for the games since curling returned as a medal sport in Nagano 1998.\n\nFounded in 1851, Kays produces the stones from its shop in the town of Mauchline near Ayr.\n\nAn aerial view of the 11th hole The Ailsa Course at The Trump Turnberry Resort.

(Getty Images: David Cannon)\n\n\"We can argue that it's probably won every gold, silver and bronze medal since the sport became a medal sport back in 1998,\" English said.\n\nAlso called Kays Scotland, the company holds the only license to harvest granite from Ailsa Craig, which is owned by Lord David Thomas Kennedy, 9th Marquess of Ailsa.\n\nGranite with elasticity\n\nAilsa Craig, at around 340m high and 3.2km in circumference, is believed to have been formed from volcanic activity millions of years ago.\n\nThe Scottish Geology Trust wrote that the island is composed \" almost entirely of microgranite,\" whose \"essentially unflawed nature\" make it ideal for curling stones.\n\nJim English, Kays Curling managing director, looks at a boulder of granite on the island of Ailsa Craig. (AP Photo: Alastair Grant)\n\nKey elements of the sport are cold and collisions \u2014 teams push stones on ice toward a scoring zone and use brooms to influence the path. So, granite that cracks easily is of no use.\n\n\"The granite itself has got elasticity properties in it,\" said Ricky English, operations manager at Kays and Jim's son.\n\nIn a collision, energy is both absorbed and released, \"so the stone doesn't split,\" he said.\n\nA large piece of unworked granite sits in the workshop at Kays Curling. (Getty Images: Jeff J Mitchell)\n\nThe blue hone granite is essentially waterproof, making it perfect for the running surface.\n\n\"You can't get this granite anywhere else in the world but Ailsa Craig,\" Ricky English said of the blue hone.\n\nThe curling stones for the 2006 Turin Olympics were the first complete Ailsa Craig stones. Previously, Kays had also used some common green from a quarry in Wales.\n\nHow does the process work?\n\nKays can go years between harvests. The common green \"falls off naturally, so we just pick from the site,\" Ricky English said. Those selections weigh between 5000 and 10,000kg.\n\nThe blue hone requires dislodging from the cliff face. Engineers drill and insert a gas charge to break the rock along its natural cracks. Those boulders are less than 2000kg, so higher quantities can mean fewer harvests.\n\nJohn Scott works on a piece of granite rock being made into a curling stone. (Getty Images: Jeff J. Mitchell)\n\nBoulders are lifted into containers and ferried back to Girvan Harbour. Galloway Granite slices the boulders and cuts round \"cheeses\" from them, and sends them back to Kays.\n\nThe common green granite forms most of the stone, including the \"striking band\" around the middle. A hole is drilled through the centre of the stone, which weighs on average 19 kg.

        "text": "A team of West Australian researchers has found one in six children living in the Kimberley region are carrying the potentially life-threatening infection strep A, with many cases left undiagnosed.\n\nThe Kids Research Institute Australia has released its findings from the Missing Piece Surveillance Study, which involved weekly Streptococcus pyogenes (strep A) testing of 250 school students from Broome and Derby, about 2,000 kilometres north of Perth.\n\nOver four years, participants had their throats and any skin infections swabbed and tested for the bacterium, with blood samples sometimes taken.\n\nProfessor Asha Bowen from the Kids Research Institute Australia said it was important to focus on links between sore throats and skin sores caused by strep A in remote communities with consistently high levels of the chronic disease.\n\nThe Kids Research Institute Australia has released three educational books for children about strep A. (ABC Kimberley: Esse Deves)\n\nLeft untreated, the often asymptomatic disease can lead to acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD).\n\nWhile ARF can be treated, RHD can be fatal, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children 55 times more likely to die from the disease than non-Indigenous children.\n\n'Certainly concerning'\n\nThe project saw the collection of 1,000 throat swabs, 200 skin swabs and 400 blood samples, which were analysed in a Perth laboratory.\n\nParticipating children \u2014 symptomatic or not \u2014 were tested for strep A every three months, with weekly swabs taken from students presenting to school with sore throats or skin sores.\n\nProfessor Bowen said the findings showed \"significantly more cases of strep A circulating than first thought\".\n\n\"The high rate of infection is certainly concerning,\" she said.\n\n\"[The results] tell us there's a lot more children at risk of rheumatic fever than are currently being counted through the standard clinic procedures because the symptoms aren't bad enough for them to think 'I need to go to clinic'.\"\n\nResults help find a path forward\n\nLead author Dr Janessa Pickering said the findings confirmed some children had recurring strep A infections, but no noticeable symptoms.\n\n\"This is important, as asymptomatic strep A infections have been shown to be a key contributor to strep A transmission and could be a vital missing link in the global conversation around RHD prevention,\" she said.\n\n\"We identified some kids carried the same type of strep A infection for years, while others never got it at all.\n\n\"[The results] provide us with a path forward for looking at the protective microbiome, or healthy bugs in the throat, that could be potentially guarding some kids against infection.\"\n\nJanessa Pickering (left) and Asha Bowen hope the study helps improve early detection measures in a bid to reduce ARF and RHD. (Supplied: The Kids Research Institute Australia)\n\nDerby Aboriginal Health Service chief executive Shelley Kneebone said while the results were concerning, having greater knowledge of how to tackle RHD was important.\n\n\"I hope the true burden of infection discovered will emphasise the need for greater focus on the social and environmental issues that affect our young children,\" she said.\n\nEarlier, faster testing trialled\n\nProfessor Bowen said despite the \"alarming numbers\" of strep A in Kimberley communities, a new study had already begun looking at ways to detect and treat it earlier and more quickly.\n\n\"We are looking at Point-of-Care tests so a result could be given for a sore throat swab within about 20 minutes of being collected, rather than waiting five to seven days,\" she said.\n\n\" If they have strep A present, they can receive treatment on the same day. \"\n\nProfessor Bowen said she hoped the findings would help \"inform guidelines and clinical care\" and lead to more investment in RHD prevention.\n\n\"It really does refine our ability to be able to provide care to the kids who need it the most, as quickly as possible,\" she said.",

(ABC News: Jessica Moran)\n\nMr Hughes said instead of following the normal process of adding water to the still, then ethanol, and covering the still before igniting the burner, Mr Longmore was seen in CCTV footage attempting to add ethanol to the still when the burner was already lit.\n\n\"In the process of pouring the second quantity of ethanol into the gin still, it ignites and Mr Longmore is enveloped in flames,\" he said.\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions argued the distillery, directed by Mr Saunders and Adam Pinkard, failed to ensure Mr Longmore properly understood the instructions for gin-making, that he was adequately supervised until proficient and that he could manage the risks involved.\n\nMan injured while making gin woke up in 'the ICU', court told A Tasmanian gin and whisky distillery is in court over a fire that resulted in a worker receiving burns to 40 per cent of his body.\n\nMr Hughes said Mr Longmore gave evidence that he had no gin-making qualification and was trained over six weeks.\n\nHe said the court heard he was given an employee handbook and a health and safety handbook, but neither of those documents contained the correct procedure for making gin.\n\nHe also said Mr Longmore told the court he had no memory of receiving any training in gin production or using the gin still but accepted his memory of the event had been heavily impacted by his injuries.\n\nThe fire happened in February 2021. (ABC News: Damian McIntyre)\n\nA doctor found Mr Longmore suffered amnesia as well as \"anger, guilt and blame-focused cognitions\" about the incident, Magistrate Hughes noted.\n\n\"Mr Longmore has stated in his evidence that he has little recollection of gin production at the distillery at any time, including between 18 January and 9 February 2021,\" Mr Hughes said.\n\n\"This includes 8 February 2021, where he is clearly depicted on CCTV operating the gin still.\n\n\" He denied knowing that ethanol is a highly flammable substance despite the clear signage to that effect. \"\n\nMr Hughes said while he did not find Mr Longmore untruthful, he noted his reliability as a witness had been impacted by his injuries.\n\nCourt hears of 'staged' training process\n\nMr Hughes noted that distillery co-director Mr Saunders, who carried out Mr Longmore's training, described a \"staged process of training and supervision of Mr Longmore\" to the court.\n\nHe said Mr Saunders described making gin on February 1 and 2, 2021, while Mr Longmore observed.\n\nOn February 3, Mr Saunders said they made gin together.\n\nOn February 4 and 5, he said Mr Longmore made four productions of gin while he observed.\n\nMr Hughes said Mr Saunders undertook an interview with WorkSafe in 2022, where he \"repeatedly states the requirement that the gas burner to the still must be ignited last and that this was demonstrated and explained to Mr Longmore on more than one occasion\".\n\nA shed was damaged by the fire in 2021. (ABC News: Damian McIntyre)\n\nMr Hughes said while some of Mr Saunders's responses suggested doubt about the competence of Mr Longmore and his capacity to manage risk, he believed they should be considered \"in the context of hindsight\".\n\n\"The fact that an incident as significant as this occurred is likely to cause doubt in the mind of even the most confident and competent supervisor,\" he said.\n\nThe magistrate said he accepted Mr Saunders was a \"witness of truth\" and dismissed the case.\n\n\"I am satisfied on the evidence that Mr Saunders provided the instruction, training and assessment he described in his evidence,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The process of gin production is inherently dangerous in that it involves a highly flammable substance, but the relatively simple and logical steps required to undertake it safely were properly explained, demonstrated and then observed by Mr Saunders when supervising Mr Longmore.\"",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size If a takeaway joint, hotel or gym is badly rated on Google, there\u2019s a good chance Jon Wyeth has visited. The Brisbane-based content creator has made a living out of visiting the city\u2019s worst-rated spots \u2013 think a KFC with 1.8 stars, or a hotel with 2.6 stars. It\u2019s a unique approach, considering most content on social media fixates on the best of the best. Instagram and TikTok users love Wyeth\u2019s candid reviews of Brisbane\u2019s not-so-celebrated locations. Jon Wyeth has been posting on social media since 2021. This masthead caught up with him at one of Brisbane\u2019s more pristine spaces \u2013 Anzac Square in the CBD. Wyeth finds that most of Brisbane\u2019s worst-reviewed spots don\u2019t quite live up to the hate, but there was one he felt warranted the backlash. \u201cIt was an eventful night, I couldn\u2019t even put some of the stuff in the video. It was too hectic. You really couldn\u2019t give it more than one star,\u201d he said of a hotel in Kangaroo Point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe stayed the night and committed to the bit \u2013 we didn\u2019t get bed bugs, although a lot of people said we would.\u201d Content on all sides of the River City Wyeth didn\u2019t think reviewing poorly regarded places would become his job. \u201cI started posting in 2021 \u2013 just stupid videos with my mates. I then started doing the voiceover and vlog-style stuff, and I started getting consistent with it,\u201d he said. Along with the worst-reviewed, he\u2019s also been ticking off the city\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous\u201d spots. Luckily for Wyeth \u2013 or unluckily for his metrics \u2013 he has yet to experience anything too out of the ordinary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are always a few interesting characters, but they\u2019re sort of just doing their own thing.\u201d Wyeth rejected criticism that he\u2019s taking advantage of lower socio-economic areas with the series, saying he wasn\u2019t going around \u201cshoving my camera in homeless people\u2019s faces\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot worse content out there,\u201d he said. Social media content creator Jon Wyeth creates content showcasing all sides of Brisbane. The gym session that nearly revived Steven Miles\u2019 political fortunes Wyeth has been building a catalogue of visits to 24-hour spots and the city\u2019s best pubs. But he\u2019s also forayed into the world of politics, making a video where he spotted then-premier Steven Miles in the gym. \u201cIt was in the lead-up to the election, so he was trying to get his face everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSomeone from his media team just reached out and said, do you want to spot Steven Miles as he tries to bench 100kg?\u201d Wyeth said Miles didn\u2019t really need any help to reach his personal best, but he was still stoked to be part of the stunt \u2013 describing it as \u201cthe Steven Miles bench press that nearly got him through\u201d. Miles lost the election, but the video had more than 680,000 views across various social media platforms and accounts. So far, Wyeth is yet to hear from David Crisafulli\u2019s team. Mostly \u2018good things to say\u2019 Not all of Wyeth\u2019s content paints Brisbane in the best light, but he says his goal is to use his platform to champion small businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNinety-five per cent of the time I only have good things to say,\u201d Wyeth said. Following Cyclone Alfred, he decided to help badly damaged Wilston cafe and ceramic studio Our Space by sharing a video. Its co-owner, Jacquie Tapsall, said his post led to an influx of new customers. \u201c[The video] really did help get our small business a lot of awareness in Brisbane,\u201d they said. \u201cSocial media, along with word of mouth, is truly the thing that keeps our business busy and being recognised and supported.\u201d What is Brisbane\u2019s Social Scene?\n\nAdvertisement",

With the extra half an hour for a result, there will be about 75 overs on offer.\n\nDan Walsh: Yes. For the third Test in a row we\u2019ll have a late session three finish, by unanimous agreement, the absolute worst result for a press box intent on sampling Adelaide\u2019s evening hospitality. England will try and run down this target in 90 overs at most and fall 200-odd short. 435 is, of course, the famous target Ricky Ponting set South Africa in 2006. Australia\u2019s 434 in the first innings was the largest ODI score at the time. It lasted 49.5 overs.\n\nTom Decent: No. I\u2019ve got a sneaking suspicion this game will go into day five. Today is going to be England\u2019s day. A few things will go their way on a decent pitch and the dream will be on.

        "text": "And though still housed in academies, several of the youngsters have already debuted in the prestigious Top 14 competition. Asi, Ma\u2019alo and Leota \u2013 all tighthead props \u2013 have played several games in European rugby, and 23-year-old former Trinity College front-rower Malachi Hawkes is at star-studded Toulouse. Why are they there? The biggest factor, both push and pull, is a rule in French rugby where players earn \u201cJIFF\u201d status (Joueurs Issus des Fili\u00e8res de Formation) by spending three years in the academy system of a club. An overseas player with JIFF status is highly valued by the clubs, therefore, because they are not counted as a \u201cforeign player\u201d in multi-layered French pro rugby, where there are restrictions of how many overseas players can be at a club. JIFF status is for life, too, and not extinguished by departing or playing Test rugby elsewhere.\n\nSo with an increasing number of youngsters heading to France, RA are responding \u2013 some would argue belatedly \u2013 by formalising a system of ongoing connection to all the departed talent with the ultimate goal of bringing them home. It had been done before but in a more ad-hoc manner. Hence the sideline snaps in frigid Paris. French forward Emmanuel Meafou, who hails from Sydney. Credit: Getty \u201cThe key thing for us is that whilst we do quite a lot of the heavy lifting and the development of players through Super Rugby clubs and our pathway programs, they can exit early, and so we don\u2019t see that fundamental development phase from 18 \u2013 even down to 16 \u2013 through to 23,\u201d Rugby Australia high-performance boss Peter Horne explains. \u201cSo there\u2019s a real need for us to reconnect. A lot of these kids are only eligible for Australia. It\u2019s just that they happen to have exited out of Australia at a stage where we might have had them in the formative years, but so we need to stay connected.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the players do want to come home at some stage, or play for Australia, it\u2019s just that they took a different journey. Loading \u201cSo it\u2019s just really staying involved, not only just showing that they\u2019re important, and that as Australians there\u2019s an opportunity, but when they\u2019re ready, to genuinely have discussions around them returning, and working with our Super clubs to look at availability and to connect with them.\u201d While former \u201cEspoirs\u201d players like NSW lock Miles Amatosero returned from Clermont to pursue a Wallabies dream, others famously have not, due to the lure of superior salaries and/or the chance to play for France. Giant Sydney-raised lock Manny Meafou \u201cfelt let down\u201d by a lack of opportunity in Australian rugby and elected to stay and declare eligibility for Les Bleus via five-years of residency. The 142kg lock is now a starter in the France national side.\n\nHawkes is in the danger zone for Australian rugby. The versatile hooker and prop, who played for the Sylvania Bulldogs, Trinity and Australian schools before moving to France in 2020, was pursued by RA earlier this year to come home but re-signed with Toulouse until 2027, and became eligible for Les Bleus this year. The 23-year-old was unable to attend Wallabies training in Paris due to club training, so Horne flew to Toulouse for a day instead. Horne also watched Leota, who is a giant tighthead prop at Racing 92 and has drawn comparisons with his now club teammate in Paris, Taniela Tupou. Former Sylvania Bulldog Malachi Hawkes playing for Toulouse in the Top 14. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo Four locks are 196cm or taller, including two \u2013 Ted Condon and Aiden Stait \u2013 who are both 203cm and 130kg-plus. \u201cThe reality is many of them have a certain somatotype [body shape] that the French love, in which big is great, and even bigger is better,\u201d Horne said.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of our players that we try to retain, but it\u2019s hard to retain everyone in a certain group. And they do go early. So the idea is to keep them tagged. They\u2019re really getting put into pro rugby pretty early, so they\u2019re actually becoming quite exposed to the high end of the game. \u201cWe obviously do need the Will Skeltons of the world, and everyone\u2019s journey is slightly different, and we want to make sure that if you\u2019re Australian, you\u2019re interested and you want to play in Super Rugby, you want to go home or you\u2019ve got an aspiration to play in a gold jersey, then we stay in contact.\u201d While the departure of young, talented \u2018bigs\u2019 sparks an instinctive concern, some argue the situation is not to be feared and can provide a massive benefit for Australian rugby if handled well. At no cost to RA and Super clubs, young tight forwards (who would otherwise be part-timers in Super academies and playing club colts or grade in Australia) can spend three years being developed in French rugby, where scrummaging and forward play are key tenets of faith. Tighthead props are so valued in France, they\u2019re often among the highest-paid players at a club.\n\nBut 130kg front rowers don\u2019t grow on trees in Australia, and prop depth at elite level is already shallow. So the obvious key is RA not losing them for good, and thus the increased time and investment being put into the connection strategy. Game vision of all players is also collated and analysed. The other upside of a rising superstar like Lemoto being in France is it meant he stayed in rugby, and did not take up one of several contract offers in the NRL. \u2018We obviously do need the Will Skeltons of the world.\u2019 RA high performance boss Peter Horne The 18-year-old had not yet travelled to France by the time the Wallabies were in town but RA are keen to keep the Australian under-18 star under the wing. Some bullishly argue Lemoto is good enough for incoming Test coach Les Kiss to pick the explosive 109kg back-rower next year, which would capture him as a Wallaby and fend off rivals. Horne said they are considering picking the outstanding No.8 from Toulouse for the Junior Wallabies (which is not a capture team) in the World Rugby Under-20 Championships in Georgia next year. But that\u2019s a thorny issue, given it could further encourage others to take the French option too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d take that into consideration and whether we want to do that or not, but there are some players that are generational talent,\u201d Horne said. Along with Schmidt and former Fiji coach Simon Raiwalui, Junior Wallabies coach Chris Whitaker is part of a group of French-speaking Australian rugby figures who have played and coached in French rugby, and will look to serve as mentors to the rookies \u2013 and pros as well. \u201cIt\u2019s super important,\u201d Whitaker says. \u201cHeinz is obviously an extremely high-quality player, and there are lots of other talented young boys over there. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for an 18/19-year-old guy to move to another country, and they probably don\u2019t speak the language and it may be all a bit overwhelming. We are there to help them with whatever they may need around their clubs or whatever, just be someone they can turn to.\u201d\n\nWhitaker would naturally love to have a player like Lemoto, and probably a few big other big boppers, too. But he is also wary. \u201cYou have to be careful about that, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some talented players but at the same time you don\u2019t want to disadvantage or dissuade in any way the kids who are staying and doing their development at home in the Australian system.\u201d RA produce weekly reports and analysis of the 30 Espoirs players, and indeed, all Australian players overseas. Schmidt, Horne and even a holidaying Kiss also met with Australian players currently playing in the UK, like Josh Kemeny and James Ramm, to keep connected and discuss the prospect of returning home. There are also plans for further meetings with senior and academy players in France, Wales and England next year. And so too the meetings that probably matter most \u2013 the ones with star Wallabies.",

Because I am just working more than two months so I need to more practice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite coming from different cultural backgrounds, Ms Salhab says they communicate well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don't speak same language, he's from different nationality, but we speak English. Ben, he's very good person. He try to learn, he want to work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth are grateful for steady jobs at the Bread and Butter Project, a social enterprise bakery in the inner-west suburb of Marrickville. Ms Salhab says the bakery is more than just a workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, the bread and butter project, they are my second family. We receive good money, we can pay our rent, we can - I bought a car already and I can save some money sent to my family in Syria and it's very good. It's perfect for me!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bakery has grown steadily since co-founder Paul Allam started up in 2013. He says it now employs 40 staff producing 1.5 million products each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe turnover is around $5 million. I think it's actually a little bit above that at the moment. So we put through thousands and thousands of loaves every week\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a background in baking, Mr Allam was inspired to start the business after helping to set up a similar project with Karen refugee women in an orphanage on the Thai-Myanmar border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I worked with probably 20 to 25 Karen women and we built this little bakery within the orphanage. And the last day we had all this product ready to go out and then the cafe owners came and the restaurant owners came and we signed up, I think it was eight accounts that day. It's very rare that bakers do, sort of, work abroad. We're not doctors, we're not engineers. So this was an opportunity for me to give a little bit back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Sydney bakery is now among 12,000 social enterprises in Australia \u2013 and focussed on training new arrivals. Tara Anderson is CEO of leading non-profit industry body, Social Traders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery year in Australia, social enterprises like the Bread and Butter project create 16 million hours of employment for people like Ben in their workforce. And across a year that's a total of 85,000 jobs that are created for people that would otherwise struggle to find them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the bakery has put 120 new arrivals through its rigorous training scheme. CEO Eva Rabanel explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many barriers for newly arrived refugees and we are bringing in people from all walks of life. Our program runs for three to six months. Our participants will receive training, hands-on training on how to make bread and pastry products and they'll also receive all sorts of wraparound support while they're here, such as one-on-one English tutoring. Our objective is at the end of the program to ensure they've got an ongoing permanent job offer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBen dreams of one day opening his own business and says \u2013 for now - baking bread is his way to give back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI make bread with love and people I hope they enjoy when they eat the bread.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this holiday season, he feels far from loved ones in Afghanistan\u2019s capital Kabul.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size If a takeaway joint, hotel or gym is badly rated on Google, there\u2019s a good chance Jon Wyeth has visited. The Brisbane-based content creator has made a living out of visiting the city\u2019s worst-rated spots \u2013 think a KFC with 1.8 stars, or a hotel with 2.6 stars. It\u2019s a unique approach, considering most content on social media fixates on the best of the best. Instagram and TikTok users love Wyeth\u2019s candid reviews of Brisbane\u2019s not-so-celebrated locations. Jon Wyeth has been posting on social media since 2021. This masthead caught up with him at one of Brisbane\u2019s more pristine spaces \u2013 Anzac Square in the CBD. Wyeth finds that most of Brisbane\u2019s worst-reviewed spots don\u2019t quite live up to the hate, but there was one he felt warranted the backlash. \u201cIt was an eventful night, I couldn\u2019t even put some of the stuff in the video. It was too hectic. You really couldn\u2019t give it more than one star,\u201d he said of a hotel in Kangaroo Point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe stayed the night and committed to the bit \u2013 we didn\u2019t get bed bugs, although a lot of people said we would.\u201d Content on all sides of the River City Wyeth didn\u2019t think reviewing poorly regarded places would become his job. \u201cI started posting in 2021 \u2013 just stupid videos with my mates. I then started doing the voiceover and vlog-style stuff, and I started getting consistent with it,\u201d he said. Along with the worst-reviewed, he\u2019s also been ticking off the city\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous\u201d spots. Luckily for Wyeth \u2013 or unluckily for his metrics \u2013 he has yet to experience anything too out of the ordinary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are always a few interesting characters, but they\u2019re sort of just doing their own thing.\u201d Wyeth rejected criticism that he\u2019s taking advantage of lower socio-economic areas with the series, saying he wasn\u2019t going around \u201cshoving my camera in homeless people\u2019s faces\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot worse content out there,\u201d he said. Social media content creator Jon Wyeth creates content showcasing all sides of Brisbane. The gym session that nearly revived Steven Miles\u2019 political fortunes Wyeth has been building a catalogue of visits to 24-hour spots and the city\u2019s best pubs. But he\u2019s also forayed into the world of politics, making a video where he spotted then-premier Steven Miles in the gym. \u201cIt was in the lead-up to the election, so he was trying to get his face everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSomeone from his media team just reached out and said, do you want to spot Steven Miles as he tries to bench 100kg?\u201d Wyeth said Miles didn\u2019t really need any help to reach his personal best, but he was still stoked to be part of the stunt \u2013 describing it as \u201cthe Steven Miles bench press that nearly got him through\u201d. Miles lost the election, but the video had more than 680,000 views across various social media platforms and accounts. So far, Wyeth is yet to hear from David Crisafulli\u2019s team. Mostly \u2018good things to say\u2019 Not all of Wyeth\u2019s content paints Brisbane in the best light, but he says his goal is to use his platform to champion small businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNinety-five per cent of the time I only have good things to say,\u201d Wyeth said. Following Cyclone Alfred, he decided to help badly damaged Wilston cafe and ceramic studio Our Space by sharing a video. Its co-owner, Jacquie Tapsall, said his post led to an influx of new customers. \u201c[The video] really did help get our small business a lot of awareness in Brisbane,\u201d they said. \u201cSocial media, along with word of mouth, is truly the thing that keeps our business busy and being recognised and supported.\u201d What is Brisbane\u2019s Social Scene?\n\nAdvertisement",

England will try and run down this target in 90 overs at most and fall 200-odd short. 435 is, of course, the famous target Ricky Ponting set South Africa in 2006.

        "text": "And though still housed in academies, several of the youngsters have already debuted in the prestigious Top 14 competition. Asi, Ma\u2019alo and Leota \u2013 all tighthead props \u2013 have played several games in European rugby, and 23-year-old former Trinity College front-rower Malachi Hawkes is at star-studded Toulouse. Why are they there? The biggest factor, both push and pull, is a rule in French rugby where players earn \u201cJIFF\u201d status (Joueurs Issus des Fili\u00e8res de Formation) by spending three years in the academy system of a club. An overseas player with JIFF status is highly valued by the clubs, therefore, because they are not counted as a \u201cforeign player\u201d in multi-layered French pro rugby, where there are restrictions of how many overseas players can be at a club. JIFF status is for life, too, and not extinguished by departing or playing Test rugby elsewhere.\n\nSo with an increasing number of youngsters heading to France, RA are responding \u2013 some would argue belatedly \u2013 by formalising a system of ongoing connection to all the departed talent with the ultimate goal of bringing them home. It had been done before but in a more ad-hoc manner. Hence the sideline snaps in frigid Paris. French forward Emmanuel Meafou, who hails from Sydney. Credit: Getty \u201cThe key thing for us is that whilst we do quite a lot of the heavy lifting and the development of players through Super Rugby clubs and our pathway programs, they can exit early, and so we don\u2019t see that fundamental development phase from 18 \u2013 even down to 16 \u2013 through to 23,\u201d Rugby Australia high-performance boss Peter Horne explains. \u201cSo there\u2019s a real need for us to reconnect. A lot of these kids are only eligible for Australia. It\u2019s just that they happen to have exited out of Australia at a stage where we might have had them in the formative years, but so we need to stay connected.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the players do want to come home at some stage, or play for Australia, it\u2019s just that they took a different journey. Loading \u201cSo it\u2019s just really staying involved, not only just showing that they\u2019re important, and that as Australians there\u2019s an opportunity, but when they\u2019re ready, to genuinely have discussions around them returning, and working with our Super clubs to look at availability and to connect with them.\u201d While former \u201cEspoirs\u201d players like NSW lock Miles Amatosero returned from Clermont to pursue a Wallabies dream, others famously have not, due to the lure of superior salaries and/or the chance to play for France. Giant Sydney-raised lock Manny Meafou \u201cfelt let down\u201d by a lack of opportunity in Australian rugby and elected to stay and declare eligibility for Les Bleus via five-years of residency. The 142kg lock is now a starter in the France national side.\n\nHawkes is in the danger zone for Australian rugby. The versatile hooker and prop, who played for the Sylvania Bulldogs, Trinity and Australian schools before moving to France in 2020, was pursued by RA earlier this year to come home but re-signed with Toulouse until 2027, and became eligible for Les Bleus this year. The 23-year-old was unable to attend Wallabies training in Paris due to club training, so Horne flew to Toulouse for a day instead. Horne also watched Leota, who is a giant tighthead prop at Racing 92 and has drawn comparisons with his now club teammate in Paris, Taniela Tupou. Former Sylvania Bulldog Malachi Hawkes playing for Toulouse in the Top 14. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo Four locks are 196cm or taller, including two \u2013 Ted Condon and Aiden Stait \u2013 who are both 203cm and 130kg-plus. \u201cThe reality is many of them have a certain somatotype [body shape] that the French love, in which big is great, and even bigger is better,\u201d Horne said.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of our players that we try to retain, but it\u2019s hard to retain everyone in a certain group. And they do go early. So the idea is to keep them tagged. They\u2019re really getting put into pro rugby pretty early, so they\u2019re actually becoming quite exposed to the high end of the game. \u201cWe obviously do need the Will Skeltons of the world, and everyone\u2019s journey is slightly different, and we want to make sure that if you\u2019re Australian, you\u2019re interested and you want to play in Super Rugby, you want to go home or you\u2019ve got an aspiration to play in a gold jersey, then we stay in contact.\u201d While the departure of young, talented \u2018bigs\u2019 sparks an instinctive concern, some argue the situation is not to be feared and can provide a massive benefit for Australian rugby if handled well. At no cost to RA and Super clubs, young tight forwards (who would otherwise be part-timers in Super academies and playing club colts or grade in Australia) can spend three years being developed in French rugby, where scrummaging and forward play are key tenets of faith. Tighthead props are so valued in France, they\u2019re often among the highest-paid players at a club.\n\nBut 130kg front rowers don\u2019t grow on trees in Australia, and prop depth at elite level is already shallow. So the obvious key is RA not losing them for good, and thus the increased time and investment being put into the connection strategy. Game vision of all players is also collated and analysed. The other upside of a rising superstar like Lemoto being in France is it meant he stayed in rugby, and did not take up one of several contract offers in the NRL. \u2018We obviously do need the Will Skeltons of the world.\u2019 RA high performance boss Peter Horne The 18-year-old had not yet travelled to France by the time the Wallabies were in town but RA are keen to keep the Australian under-18 star under the wing. Some bullishly argue Lemoto is good enough for incoming Test coach Les Kiss to pick the explosive 109kg back-rower next year, which would capture him as a Wallaby and fend off rivals. Horne said they are considering picking the outstanding No.8 from Toulouse for the Junior Wallabies (which is not a capture team) in the World Rugby Under-20 Championships in Georgia next year. But that\u2019s a thorny issue, given it could further encourage others to take the French option too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d take that into consideration and whether we want to do that or not, but there are some players that are generational talent,\u201d Horne said. Along with Schmidt and former Fiji coach Simon Raiwalui, Junior Wallabies coach Chris Whitaker is part of a group of French-speaking Australian rugby figures who have played and coached in French rugby, and will look to serve as mentors to the rookies \u2013 and pros as well. \u201cIt\u2019s super important,\u201d Whitaker says. \u201cHeinz is obviously an extremely high-quality player, and there are lots of other talented young boys over there. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for an 18/19-year-old guy to move to another country, and they probably don\u2019t speak the language and it may be all a bit overwhelming. We are there to help them with whatever they may need around their clubs or whatever, just be someone they can turn to.\u201d\n\nWhitaker would naturally love to have a player like Lemoto, and probably a few big other big boppers, too. But he is also wary. \u201cYou have to be careful about that, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some talented players but at the same time you don\u2019t want to disadvantage or dissuade in any way the kids who are staying and doing their development at home in the Australian system.\u201d RA produce weekly reports and analysis of the 30 Espoirs players, and indeed, all Australian players overseas. Schmidt, Horne and even a holidaying Kiss also met with Australian players currently playing in the UK, like Josh Kemeny and James Ramm, to keep connected and discuss the prospect of returning home. There are also plans for further meetings with senior and academy players in France, Wales and England next year. And so too the meetings that probably matter most \u2013 the ones with star Wallabies.",
