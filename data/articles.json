Stocks have whipsawed as volatility has spiked.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his advisers said this was the plan all along: Scare the bejesus out of the world by announcing astronomically high tariffs.

The S&P 500 rose 1.81 per cent and the Nasdaq was 2.06 per cent higher.\n\nMarkets were buoyed by Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins telling the Financial Times Friday that the central bank would step in to support financial markets if there were signs of distress.\n\nBut stock market investors have been trading on a knife's edge, and any announcement coming from the Trump administration on tariffs has the ability to send stocks surging or tumbling.\n\nREAD MORE: Top Australian model Lucy Markovic dies after health battle\n\nFollowing another steep sell-off Thursday, stocks appeared calmer \u2014 for now \u2014 and posted strong gains Friday. (CNN)\n\nFor example, stocks plunged Thursday after the Trump administration clarified the math it had already used to set China's massive 145 per cent tariff.\n\nThe street had believed the tariff was 125 per cent. The Dow sank sharply, at one point falling more than 2000 points.\n\nIn the 129-year history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index has closed higher or lower by at least 1000 points just 31 times.

US Treasuries are historically considered to be the safest of safe assets, backed up by the full faith and credit of the US government.\n\nBut bonds aren't rising \u2014 they're falling.\n\nThat's largely because investors have lost faith in US trade policy, and they fear America could get hurt even worse than the countries Trump's tariff policy is targeting.\n\nUS Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5 per cent. (CNN)\n\nAs JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday, Trump's \"America First\" policy risks alienating its most important partners and the country's special standing in the world.\n\nUS Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5 per cent. They were under 4 per cent earlier in the week.\n\nThat represents a massive move for the market. Higher yields could hurt America's economy, as a number of consumer loans are closely tied to those rates.\n\n\"The upward action in rates has been rapid in historical context and has provided no comfort to investors looking for havens in turbulent markets,\" analysts at Citi said in a Friday note.\n\nUS Treasuries were on track for their worst week since 2019, according to Bloomberg's US Treasury total return index. (AP)\n\nUS Treasuries were on track for their worst week since 2019, according to Bloomberg's US Treasury total return index, when the New York Federal Reserve had to step in and purchase Treasuries to bring down a spike in yields caused by a liquidity crunch.\n\n\"Current market conditions don't require Fed intervention at this point, but Fed officials are likely monitoring market function closely,\" said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services.\n\nDimon said Friday on an earnings call that he expects there will be a \"kerfuffle\" in the Treasury markets that would lead to the Federal Reserve intervening.\n\n\"They're not going to do it now \u2026 they'll do it when they start to panic a little bit,\" Dimon said.\n\nOil\n\nThe oil market has been trading like we're going into a recession.\n\nPrices have tumbled over the course of the past couple of weeks as investors feared Trump's trade policy could sap demand for travel, shipping and transportation \u2014 all of which require fuel.\n\nUS oil on Friday morning fell below $US60 ($96) a barrel, close to a four-year low, before recovering slightly.\n\nUS oil on Friday morning fell below $US60 ($96) a barrel, close to a four-year low, before recovering slightly.

(AP)\n\nOil prices have served as a prime recession indicator in recent years. Prices tumbled after surging above $US100 ($160) a barrel for the first time as the Great Recession took hold in 2008.\n\nAnd prices went negative for the first time during the pandemic as a glut of oil became so severe that traders were literally paying storage facilities to take the unwanted oil off their hands.\n\nDollar\n\nThe dollar on Friday tumbled to its lowest level in three years. That's the opposite of what you'd expect when tariffs are put in place.\n\nTypically, tariffs raise the value of a local currency, because it encourages residents to purchase homemade goods instead of foreign options, stretching their money further in comparison to other currencies.\n\nBut currency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump's trade war fallout and end up comparatively weaker than before tariffs were put in place.\n\nThe dollar on Friday hit its lowest level against the euro since 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: Remains of dozens of First Nations ancestors return home\n\nCurrency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump's trade war fallout.

The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and political uncertainty.\n\nTrade deals\n\nDespite financial markets casting enormous doubt that the Trump administration can salvage the opportunity it created for itself to strike bilateral trade agreements with all 150 countries around the world, the Trump administration remains optimistic.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal that could get them out from under the thumb of Trump's punishing tariffs.\n\nAlthough the administration has provided few details of which countries it is negotiating with, it said it would favor allies like South Korea and Japan first.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal. (AP)\n\nBut trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months.\n\nAnd even if Trump were to negotiate trade with all those countries over a short period \u2014 whether full deals or letters of agreement that put a framework of a deal together \u2014 China, the world's biggest exporter, remains the elephant in the room.\n\nUS tariffs on China are now at least 145 per cent and China on Friday retaliated with 125 per cent tariffs of its own.\n\nThat will do enormous damage to the world's two largest economies, and both sides have said they are not eager to back down.\n\nChina has consistently said it is open to negotiations, but wants to do it in a way in which it will be respected.\n\nChina has ignored America's warnings not to raise its tariffs, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n\nEconomists have been unmoved by Trump's sudden change in tune. (AP)\n\nIn the meantime, economists have been unmoved by Trump's sudden change in tune. Although negotiated trade agreements would undoubtedly be good news for the economy, much of the damage has already been done, Wall Street economists have argued.\n\nAnd punishing 10 per cent universal tariffs remain in place, as do 25 per cent tariffs on autos, 25 per cent tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada, and 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum.",

        "text": "Actor Eric Dane has revealed he has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease.\n\nThe US actor, who is best known for his role as doctor Mark Sloan on Grey's Anatomy, confirmed his diagnosis to People magazine.\n\nThe 52-year-old said he was \"grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter\".\n\nHe said he would continue to work and was \"looking forward to returning to the set of Euphoria\", while asking for privacy for himself and his family.\n\nYou may already be familiar with ALS, especially if you took part in the viral ice bucket challenge to raise awareness of the condition back in 2014.\n\nBut if not, here are the disorder's main symptoms and treatments.\n\nWhat is ALS?\n\nALS is the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).\n\nIt is a terminal degenerative disorder that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles.\n\nAccording to Health Direct, because the disease affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, patients slowly lose the use of their limbs and ability to speak, swallow and breathe independently.\n\nMND Australia says:\n\n\"Weak muscles, stiff limbs and overactive reflexes are key features of ALS. \"It most commonly starts in a limb (arm or leg) and progresses over time to other parts of the body.\"\n\nTo clarify, MND is the widely used generic term in Australia, the UK and parts of Europe. ALS is used more generically in the US, Canada and South America.\n\nOther stars who have been diagnosed with ALS include R&B singer Roberta Flack, Star Trek actor Kenneth Mitchell and SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg.\n\nOscar winner Sandra Bullock's longtime partner Bryan Randall died from ALS in 2023.\n\nDane is married to wife Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he shares two daughters. (Reuters: Lucy Nicholson)\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nThe exact cause of ALS is unknown.\n\nHealth Direct says about one in 10 cases are \"familial\", meaning the condition is inherited.\n\nWhat are the first warning signs of ALS?\n\nALS generally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time.\n\nInitial symptoms might include:\n\nStumbling\n\nDifficulty holding and gripping objects\n\nSlurred speech\n\nSwallowing difficulties\n\nCramps and muscle twitching\n\nAs the disease progresses, patients may develop:\n\nDifficulty breathing\n\nFatigue caused by muscle tiredness, reduced lung capacity, weight loss, reduced food intake and changes to metabolism\n\nInsomnia\n\nMild changes in cognitive skills\n\nSome pain and discomfort\n\nALS does not usually affect the senses including the ability to taste, smell, touch or hear.\n\nHow does ALS affect life expectancy?\n\nThe rate at which ALS progresses can vary from one person to another.\n\nBut the mean survival time with the disease is two to five years.\n\nHowever, some patients can live for decades, like Stephen Hawking, who lived with the disorder for 55 years before dying at 76.\n\nThere is currently no cure for ALS.",

(Getty Images) One of the frustrations for the Suns in recent seasons has been their tendency to let things slip in the games they are expected to win, particularly on the road. It\u2019s been one of the reasons why they haven\u2019t come close to ending their wait for finals. So far this season, things have looked different, but it\u2019s very early days and we\u2019ve seen a few false dawns on the Coast before now.

(Getty Images) Hello and welcome to ABC's coverage of day three of AFL's Gather Round! Today is a big day of footy, with matches stretching from the Barossa to suburban Norwood and the Theatre by the Torrens, Adelaide Oval. What's on our menu for Super Saturday in SA? First-up we head to Lyndoch, where the new Barossa Park will be christened as North Melbourne take on Gold Coast. Then it's off to town again for Carlton's absolute must-win game against the Eagles at Adelaide Oval, before a twilight match at Norwood Oval as the Bulldogs try to knock off the defending premiers Brisbane. Finally we go back to Adelaide Oval for the Demons and the Bombers, with both sides desperate to kickstart their seasons with a win. I'm Andrew McGarry and I'll be kicking things off today before handing over to Kyle Pollard, and maybe the odd message from our man in SA for Gather Round, Dean Bilton.

(ABC Landline)\n\nAustralian grain-fed beef in demand\n\nStatistics from Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) show Australian grain-fed beef exports to China have ramped up significantly, with 21,885 tonnes shipped in February and March \u2014 up nearly 40 per cent on the same period last year.\n\nSpeaking at a meat processing industry conference on the Gold Coast this week, Bindaree Food Group's Andrew Simpson said the trade war was creating indirect opportunities.\n\n\"If there's a tit-for-tat around the globe and countries like Japan or China push up reciprocal tariffs, it may prevent American beef becoming commercially viable into those regions [and] Australian beef will fill the gap, which could present a short-term opportunity,\" he said.\n\nWhat is a tariff? A tariff is a tax on a product imported from another country\n\nfrom another country It is paid to the government by the company that imports the product\n\nthat imports the product A tariff is generally calculated as a percentage of the price paid by the importer to the foreign seller\n\npaid by the importer to the foreign seller Historically, tariffs have pushed up prices because higher product costs are often passed on to consumers\n\nGlobal meat analyst Brett Stuart said Australia would be a clear winner going forward.\n\n\"Australia is now the lone supplier of high-quality white fat marbled beef into China,\" he said.\n\n\"[US beef] sales to China have fallen to zero \u2026 and not only is the market now closed based on the March 16 production date, but the combined retaliation tariffs by China now take the tariff on US beef to 116 per cent, a level that will quickly halt trade.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAre we missing the bigger picture?\n\nBut shadow trade minister Kevin Hogan said the trade war between the two biggest economies in the world could hurt demand for Australian exports.\n\n\"We're a large exporting nation and we need global growth to be good,\" he said.\n\n\" In the short term this trade war might present opportunities for Australian beef exports, but the bigger picture here is, if this tariff war slows growth in both the US and China, then demand for a lot of the things we sell overseas would slow. \"\n\nRabobank global strategist Michael Every said ongoing commentary about Trump's tariffs was missing the bigger picture.\n\nLoading...\n\nSpeaking at the Food Futures conference in Darwin this week, he said most nations, including Australia, had not grasped the seriousness of what was happening in the world.\n\n\"We're now in an era of economic statecraft where it's about national security and national interests, rather than inflation or a balanced budget. These are irrelevant points now,\" Mr Every said.\n\n\"Fundamentally, it will come down to the US trying to set terms to China, decouple where it can, and then saying to everyone else globally \u2014 and particularly in the West, like Australia \u2014 so, are you with us or not?\n\n\"And if you're not, well, good luck to you.\"",

(ABC News: Carl Saville)\n\nThe goal is to develop robust grape varieties that reduce the need for chemical treatments while maintaining the quality and characteristics of Australian wines.\n\nPowdery and downy mildew cost the sector nearly $170 million a year and the industry has been looking for more economical and sustainable alternatives to current chemical control methods.\n\nFor the last 15 years, the CSIRO has been working with Wine Australia and Treasury Wine Estate, the owners of Wynns Estate, to breed mildew-resistant vines.\n\nBen Harris and Sue Hodder say the blend of heritage vine traits and modern breeding could transform Australia's wine industry.

(ABC News: Carl Saville)\n\nNinety-nine promising vines have since been planted at the Wynns Coonawarra vineyards, but it will be a couple of years before they are mature enough to yield sufficient fruit for small-scale winemaking.\n\nBen Harris, the technical viticulturalist who oversees the vineyard, meticulously monitors the health of the experimental vines.\n\n\"We need to assess how the vines perform and also the quality of the fruit and, more importantly, the quality of the wine,\" he said.\n\n\" This comprehensive evaluation is paramount in determining the success of the breeding program. \"\n\nBen Harris says the aim is to combine \"the best of the past\" with cutting-edge science to breed vines for a changing climate. (ABC News: Carl Saville)\n\nThe hope is to produce mildew-resistant grapes that maintain their distinctive traits.\n\n\"We basically do micro-ferments and make very small batches of wine from all these individual grapevines and basically determine the fruit quality and then select the best wines from there,\" Mr Harris said.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.",

        "text": "Rory McIlroy has roared back into Masters contention as runaway overnight leader Justin Rose saw his advantage evaporate at Augusta National.\n\nEngland's former world number one, Rose, carded a one-under-par 71 to reclaim the clubhouse lead at eight under, holing a clutch par putt on the last with his rivals circling.\n\nBryson DeChambeau shot a four-under 68 to finish a shot behind Rose, while Matt McCarty made history to finish at five under. World number one Scottie Scheffler was five under through 13 holes.\n\nJason Day quickly emerged as Australia's main hope, skipping onto the front page of the leaderboard with three front-nine birdies to reach five under and sit in a tie for fifth through 13 holes.\n\nHe narrowly missed two more birdie putts around Amen Corner but remained the only bogey-free player in an otherwise helter-skelter tournament.\n\nMin Woo Lee was even through 14 holes to be one under through 14 holes and safely inside the two-over cut line.\n\nBut the wheels fell off for Cameron Smith (five over, 71, 78), who started the day at one under but went backwards, a double bogey on the 11th a bitter pill to swallow as he missed the cut for the first time in nine visits.\n\nAdam Scott (five over, 77, 72) also missed the cut for the first time in 16 years while Cam Davis (nine under, 74, 79) finished close to last.\n\nCameron Smith was one of several Australians to endure a day to forget at the Masters. (Getty Images: Andrew Redington)\n\nBut all eyes are on world number two McIlroy, who wilted on Friday AEST with a duo of double bogeys after he had soared to four under to seemingly kiss his chances of a maiden green jacket \u2014 and career grand slam \u2014 goodbye.\n\nThe Northern Irishman put that behind him on Friday, making back-to-back birdies after the turn and an eagle on the par-five 13th that shot him back into the guts of the leaderboard.\n\nHe then launched an audacious approach from the pine needles, over the towering trees, on the next hole that led to a tap-in par.\n\nMcIlroy edged a shot closer to the leaders with a birdie on the 15th \u2014 the par-5 he took seven on a day earlier \u2014 to finish just two shots off the pace.\n\n\"I think overall, just proud of myself with how I responded today after the finish last night,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"I just had to remind myself that I played really good golf yesterday, and you know, I wasn't going to let, you know, two bad holes sort of dictate the narrative for the rest of the week.\"\n\nPhoenix native McCarty (five-under) double-bogeyed the first hole and dropped another shot on the next, but still carded a four-under 68 to take a brief clubhouse lead.\n\nThe historic recovery included eight birdies in 12 holes, McCarty the first to shoot 68 or better in a round in which he was three-over or worse at any stage.\n\nFormer champion Scott, who declined requests for interviews post-round, has missed just two cuts in his 23-year Masters history.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Scientists at three Australian universities believe a dark purple plum bred in Queensland could help delay, or even prevent, dementia.\n\nResearchers at the University of Wollongong, the University of Queensland and Victoria University are testing juice from the Queen Garnet plum to see if it can protect the brain.\n\nWhile each team's work is in its infancy, Victoria University's Michael Mathai says the results are very promising.\n\nPlant breeder Bruce Topp and his colleague named the plum \"Queen\" for Queensland and \"Garnet\" for its flesh. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"There is evidence that people with early-stage dementia or perhaps mild cognitive impairment \u2026 can be helped by this,\" Professor Mathai said.\n\n\" Certainly there are some markers of inflammation which go down when they're taking plum extract. \"\n\nEarly research shows promising brain benefits\n\nDr Mathai has been adding plum extract to lab-grown neuronal cells, which mimic brain cells.\n\n\"We see increases in genes or proteins made by the cells, which drive the formation of new connections and the lengthening of the axons, which are like the telephone wires that connect to the different cells \u2026 that's the basis for things like making new memories,\" he said.\n\nMichael Mathai is exploring the plum's potential to protect and possibly repair damaged brain tissue. (Supplied)\n\nWhile the research could have huge implications for the aged care sector, Professor Mathai is eager to know if the plum can also repair traumatic brain injuries.\n\n\"We've already shown the extract will protect against chemically induced damage from oxidative stress, for example, that's a neuro protection area, but \u2026 will it help to repair already damaged tissue? That's something which we need to investigate further,\" he said.\n\nIn Brisbane, Yasmina Sultanbawa says the Queen Garnet plum's high levels of anthocyanins, a compound found in purple, blue and some red fruit and vegetables, may explain its potential to improve brain health.\n\nAnthocyanins are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies suggest they help reduce blood pressure, delay diabetes and support heart health.\n\nGut health and the 'poo machine'\n\nProfessor Sultanbawa believes eating extracts, juices and powders made from the high anthocyanin plums could one day be a cheaper way of treating lifestyle diseases than prescription drugs, and without the side effects.\n\nHer research team is investigating the connection between gut and brain health, and the impact of eating foods high in anthocyanins.\n\nYasmina Sultanbawa is investigating how gut bacteria turn plum compounds into health-boosting molecules. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"The brain and gut are two organs that are talking to each other all the time, but we don't have enough knowledge in that space,\" Professor Sultanbawa said.\n\n\"If you can really get the gut and the brain to work together, and if you understand it more, you will get a much healthier population.\"\n\nHer lab is home to Australia's only scientific \"poo machine\", a series of glass chambers that recreate what happens in the human digestive system.\n\nTests have shown less than 5 per cent of anthocyanins are absorbed in the small intestine, with most of the absorption happening in the large intestine.\n\nScientists are testing Queen Garnet extract to see if it protects lab-grown brain cells from inflammation. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"The magic happens in the colon where the poo is,\" Professor Sultanbawa said.\n\n\"You get like 10 trillion micro-organisms in your poo, and that microbiota will convert the anthocyanins to little molecules \u2026which are really good for your body\u2026 [they're] anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and even cognitive functions will be improved.\"\n\nThis lab has a \"poo machine\" to study how the gut processes the plum's anthocyanins. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nWith dementia and brain injury placing increasing pressure on families and the economy, she argues it's only logical to invest more in gut-brain research \u2014 a move that may cost millions in the short term but could save billions in healthcare in the future.\n\nHollywood interest boosts Queen Garnet profile\n\nThe plum season ended last month, but interest is ramping up.\n\nActor Chris Hemsworth recently showed interest in the Queen Garnet plum.\n\nSeveral years ago, the movie star discovered he was predisposed to developing Alzheimer's and commissioned a television series looking at the latest breakthroughs in dementia prevention.\n\nChris Hemsworth has been on a mission to raise awareness about dementia prevention. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)\n\nHis research team contacted Sid and Bonney Ghosh, who own a controlling share in Nutrafruit, the company with the rights to market the plum.\n\nThe father and son team are excited the Australian-bred plum, with higher levels of anthocyanins than blueberries, might feature in Mr Hemsworth's series.\n\nBonney and Sid Ghosh are expanding the Queen Garnet plum's reach into global markets including China. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"It is early conversations; I think they weren't expecting to find something in their own backyard, so there's a lot of energy around that,\" CEO of Nutrafruit Sid Ghosh said.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed Chris Hemsworth plans to feature the Queen Garnet plum in his new YouTube series later this year.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.",

(ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nThe former NT government's promised aged care facility was to be funded by the Commonwealth and include 60 beds, with 12 of those for specialist dementia care.\n\nThe plan had been to partner with the private sector to deliver the facility next to the Palmerston Regional Hospital, outside Darwin.\n\nBut earlier this year, NT Health confirmed the former government had not found any providers that could both build and manage the facility.\n\nAnthony Albanese said Australia's aged care system was neglected before Labor took government in 2022. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nIn the meantime, a federal overhaul of aged care funding left its future in limbo.\n\nNow federal Labor has committed to building the same facility with double the number of beds.\n\nThe prime minister argues during its first term in government, Labor has turned around an aged care system in \"crisis\".\n\n\"Is there more work to do? Absolutely,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nShadow Minister for Health and Aged Care Anne Ruston said an elected Coalition government would \"invest up to $60 million in aged care infrastructure to ensure Territorians get the care they need, when they need it\".\n\n\"The Coalition has been working constructively with the NT government and local providers on this issue and how best to remove existing barriers to investment in the Top End,\" she said.\n\nSteve Edgington says it will take double the amount of funding to deliver the 120-bed facility.

(ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\n\"We have the fastest growing number of seniors in the country \u2026 they need to be able to age very safely and have the care they deserve.\"\n\nShe believes whichever party forms government needs to do more to attract aged care staff to the NT, and support First Nations Territorians living remotely to age on country.\n\nHaving spent years waiting for updates, Jill is sceptical about whether any government will deliver the facility.\n\n\"They'll tell us what they want us to hear and foolishly, we listen,\" Jill said.",

(ABC News: Monish Nand)\n\nHe said the new, more-structured approach would make co-contributions unavoidable in many cases.\n\nBased on current pricing of services, Mr Moraitis estimates a full pensioner receiving about five to six hours of support a week could pay anywhere between $10 and $30 a week more.\n\n\"For someone living on the full pension of about $1,100 per fortnight, even a modest co-payment could impact affordability, especially for those also managing rent, utilities and other living costs,\" he said.\n\nThe co-payments for part pensioners and self-funded retirees will be higher and means-tested.\n\nMr Moraitis said not all self-funded retirees had the capacity to pay more or had easy access to funds.\n\n\"We may see some retirees opt out of care services altogether, which could lead to delayed support needs and greater pressure on hospitals and aged care facilities down the track,\" he said.\n\nShowering not a luxury, advocates say\n\nThe Older Persons Advocacy Network (OPAN) said there were good aspects to the new Aged Care Act.\n\n\"The Support at Home Program has a lot of positives of bringing more timely services, more services in people's homes \u2026 and access to allied health,\" OPAN chief executive Craig Gear said.\n\nHe has also welcomed a palliative care payment of $25,000, which will be available to help recipients spend their final three months at home.\n\nThe Support at Home Program works to keep older Australians living at home independently for longer. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nMr Gear has raised concerns about the classifications of some services, saying that under the new rules help with showering falls under independent support and will therefore attract a co-contribution.\n\n\"We think showers should be considered as part of clinical care that is not a luxury,\" he said.\n\nThe organisation also has concerns about a lack of detail on the changes, which is just months away from being introduced.\n\n\" Some of the pricing information people are looking for, we know providers are looking for that as well. \"\n\nA government fact sheet containing information about the changes to Home Care Packages under Support at Home, is available here.\n\nCan older Australians avoid aged care costs?\n\nMr Moraitis said the government had been working to close loopholes that could help aged care service users avoid or reduce paying costs.\n\nElderly Australians to pay more under aged care deal struck by government Photo shows A young woman comforts an older man holding a stress ball Major changes in aged care are coming, after months of back-room negotiations over sensitive reforms including requiring many new aged care entrants to pay more for their own care.\n\nHe said trying to game the system could backfire if policies changed.\n\n\"While some people may try to shield assets by transferring money into family trusts or gifting it to children, there are strict rules in place to prevent this from affecting aged care fees and entitlements,\" he said.\n\n\"If someone gives away large amounts of money or transfers assets below market value, Centrelink still counts those assets for five years when assessing aged care fees and pension eligibility.\"\n\nMr Moraitis said family trusts were closely scrutinised.\n\n\"If a person is a beneficiary or has control over a trust, the value of the trust may still be considered as part of their assessable assets, depending on how it is structured,\" he said.\n\nHe said in some cases, people who had planned more than five years in advance before needing care may have structured their assets in ways that could reduce aged care fees.\n\n\"However, for most people, the government closes loopholes by ensuring that 'deliberate deprivation' of assets does not lead to reduced contributions,\" he said.\n\n\"Anyone considering these strategies should seek financial advice from an accredited aged care specialist to avoid unexpected consequences, including impacts on pension eligibility and estate planning.\"\n\nThis story is not intended to provide financial advice and readers should consult a qualified professional for financial advice.",

        "text": "Alex de Minaur has showcased his ruthless side by humbling Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov 6-0, 6-0 to feast on the first \"double bagel\" of his professional career while powering into the Monte Carlo Masters semifinal.\n\nThe Australian was in a merciless mood against the out-of-sorts veteran, taking only 44 minutes to hand the world number 18 one of his most embarrassing defeats on the Monte Carlo Country Club's main arena, Court Rainier III.\n\nIt was a real statement performance from 26-year-old de Minaur as he reached the third clay-court semifinal of his career and demonstrated that this was no longer a surface that befuddled him.\n\nAsked if he realised he had achieved the first whitewash win of his pro career, de Minaur smiled: \"I did know that \u2014 and I also know the only time I ever lost 6-0, 6-0 myself was to Tommy Paul in the semifinals of the US Juniors. It's pretty crazy.\"\n\nA \"double bagel\" is certainly a rare feat at this level of tennis. Indeed, it was the first such scoreline in any ATP tournament at the quarterfinal stage and beyond for 12 years since the great Roger Federer blanked Mischa Zverev in the last eight in Halle.\n\nDe Minaur, ranked number 10 in the world, had expected a tough duel against the evergreen Dimitrov, but after dominating the early stages, he seemed to drain all the belief and confidence from the 33-year-old and then never took his foot off the pedal as the Bulgarian just coughed up more unforced errors, 23 in all.\n\nAfter winning the first set 6-0 in just 23 minutes \u2014 the first time Dimitrov has failed to win a game in any stanza for nine years \u2014 de Minaur earned another break at the start of the second with a dazzling backhand lob that just continued the strangulation.\n\nNothing went right for Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, who was beaten in just 44 minutes. (Getty Images: Mateo Villalba)\n\nGetting only stronger and more aggressive as the one-sided fare progressed, de Minaur dropped only 15 out of the 63 points played to become the first Australian since John Alexander in 1979 to make the semifinals of the famous old tournament in the principality.\n\nHe is also the first Aussie since Lleyton Hewitt in Hamburg in 2007 to reach a Masters 1000 clay-court semifinal as he chalked up a tour-leading 20th win of the season.\n\nThere was even better news for de Minaur as he pondered the chance of reaching his first clay-court final as he will not be facing his nemesis Stefanos Tsitsipas in the last four, with Italian Lorenzo Musetti causing an upset by defeating the Greek 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\nTsitsipas, who had a woeful day with his serving, holds an 11-1 career record against de Minaur, but the Australian has a 1-1 record against the Wimbledon semifinalist Musetti in what looks a difficult match to call as they meet for the first time on clay.\n\nEarlier, the rare treat of two Australians making the semis of the same Masters event was dashed when Alexei Popyrin was soundly beaten 6-3, 6-2 by Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in 69 minutes.\n\nSo frustrated was Popyrin by his off day after winning three matches in three days, he ended up getting a code violation for ball abuse, trying to smash one out of the stadium in anger.\n\nThe match of the day, though, featured Carlos Alcaraz's fabulous, hard-fought victory over young French gun Arthur Fils, the 20-year-old rising talent who will be ruing his missed opportunities after going down 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 in a thrilling contest on Rainier.\n\n\"I have missed clay,\" the French Open champ beamed.\n\nAAP",

So I definitely had a lot of people in my life that showed me the value of work ethic, especially in the sporting realm. And it made me believe, \u2018oh, it\u2019s possible, I can go do that too\u2019.\u201d\n\nMiller was one of those Energizer bunny kids who excelled at gymnastics and dancing from a young age. It wasn\u2019t unusual to be out the door at 6am and back at 9pm. Desiree Miller performing as a young state squad gymnast In the gym, Miller was a state representative on the floor, beam, bars and vault, and in the dance studio, she performed in ballet, tap, jazz, hip-hop and contemporary disciplines. \u201cWe used to travel around the world every couple of years (for dance),\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe competed in Spain and in America, we even performed at Disneyland. I\u2019ve performed at Disneyland three times. It was amazing. I got to travel the world.\u201d\n\nGoing to school in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, and in Hong Kong during her teenage years, Miller also somehow found time to play other sports. Lots of them. \u201cI was a diver, a tennis player, I played soccer, did a bit of basketball, I was too short for that. And netball and hockey, too - just a bunch of sports,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt (dance) helped me translate so much, especially whenever I tried a new sport, I was always balanced and coordinated. Same with gymnastics, I had that power and strength. So when I made the turn to rugby, it was kind of combining everything - and adding the contact part that I was missing out on for all those years.\u201d Desi Miller scoring her third try in the 2024 Super W grand final. Credit: Getty Images In mid-2021, with COVID-19 still stalking the world, Miller was looking for a new team sport and to make some new mates. A friend suggested rugby and Miller rolled up at Easts where she was introduced to the game via sevens, and then 15s. It was love at first tackle bag.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018this is amazing\u2019. I absolutely love it,\u201d Miller said. Miller\u2019s pace and strength immediately saw her stand out for Easts, and halfway through 2022, she was invited to train with the NSW women\u2019s sevens squad. That turned into 15-a-side squad training with the Waratahs\u2019 Super W squad, and in 2023, Miller made her debut for the Tahs against the Force. In the same year, Miller was chosen for the Wallaroos squad and made her debut against England. In the years since, Miller has become a mainstay for NSW and Australia. Her statistics make for eye-popping reading. In 17 games for NSW, Miller has scored 17 tries, made 35 linebreaks and 28 offloads, and beaten a whopping 73 defenders. In 12 Tests, Miller has scored 7 tries, 24 linebreaks and beaten 48 defenders.\n\nThis year, the Super Rugby women\u2019s competition saw several Aussie sevens stars switch to 15s for a few games, in an attempt to make the 2025 Rugby World Cup squad.

But the testament of how well the incumbent Wallaroos wingers, Miller and Maya Stewart (who was the Wallaroos\u2019 MVP last year) are both playing, Levi currently wouldn\u2019t unseat either.

Hunt and others have also created protocols that can check passwords to see if they\u2019ve been caught up in a breach, and many companies use these so they can prompt users to change passwords before an attack occurs.\n\nBut an ironclad way to avoid being a victim of credential stuffing is to not reuse passwords, and particularly to have a unique password for any service that holds your money or sensitive data. There are many password managers that will keep all your unique passwords safe and encrypted, and some also integrate the technology that can tell you if one of your passwords has been found in data sold on the dark web, so you can change it.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\nThis story is part of the April 12 edition of Good Weekend. See all 12 stories .\n\nTowards the end of summer each year, I wind up at the doctor\u2019s office. It was a standing joke with my GP that each January he would tell me to wear earplugs when swimming, and I\u2019d respond that I couldn\u2019t hear him until after he\u2019d applied a high-pressure surgical piston to blast out the accumulated gunk.\n\nI swim a lot, which is a diplomatic way of saying that I enjoy wading into the crisp ocean and ducking my head under a few waves that are mostly waist-height. When you are lucky enough to grow up near the sea, you partake of this liberally. Dips before work. During lunch. At knock-off. There is nothing like the bracing freshness of a long-awaited plunge.\n\nBut the bones in my ears are not like yours. Since my early 20s they have been growing over, fusing into twisted tree roots that are perilously close to my brain. This is called external auditory canal exostoses and the net result is water gets trapped deep in my ears, calcifies into salty wax and renders me practically deaf.\n\nMy GP was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer early last year and passed away a painfully short time later, just as the ocean started warming up. I was bereft at the news of his death; he had been a friend of the family and a wonderfully selfless man. My father had also been a GP, and both their memorials were thronged with the grief of an extended community that had lost something vital to its very functioning. Doctors do not typically get state funerals but in their outpouring of mourners, their farewells can feel a bit like one. A former patient realises very quickly that they are but one of hundreds, all of whom maintain a distinctly personal relationship with someone who checks their bloods, listens to their chests and, on occasion, peers into their ears.\n\nThose who serve our communities aren\u2019t typically thought about in the same way as family members or friends. But they are crucial totems in our lives.\n\nOnce my doctor knew he was dying, his surgery arranged for my file to be transferred to another practice. A different GP would peruse my previous mental health plans and uncover my penicillin allergy. This should not have felt as strange as it did, like intimate details being passed on to a new lover. We tend to hold the view that certain members of society are with us for life; having them suddenly shut up shop, move towns or onto the next astral plane can be highly distressing.\n\nThose who serve our communities, whether they treat our maladies, tailor our dresses or tame our tresses, aren\u2019t typically thought about in the same way as family members or friends. But they are crucial totems in our lives, keepers of knowledge and secrets and an ongoing, living history to which few others have access. The level of trust placed in my hairdresser three days before my wedding is more than I ever expect from anyone at my bank.",

        "text": "To understand the Sunshine upgrade as proposed by Labor, it helps to think of the project as a level crossing removal or the transformation of a busy road into a freeway. Sunshine sits at the meeting point of multiple regional and suburban rail lines coming from Victoria\u2019s west, including 70 per cent of the V/Line network. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday spruiking the proposed Sunshine station upgrade with Premier Jacinta Allan. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The tracks around the station are like a busy traffic intersection where trains are sometimes forced to wait to get into the correct \u201clane\u201d or reach the platform. The Sunshine project aims to solve these problems by redesigning the network along a six-kilometre stretch of rail so that regional trains, suburban services and freight are kept on their own separate paths. Doing so will make room for 40 trains an hour.\n\nThis includes building a series of rail bridges that will steer trains onto the correct track without having to cut across the path of others. The Level Crossing Removal Project, which has been performing a similar task across 110 different Victorian intersections, is the department delivering the upgrade. A new pair of tracks will also be built between Sunshine and West Footscray to make this untangling process more simple and add capacity for more trains. Sunshine station will be expanded, with two new platforms accommodating these tracks and receiving most V/Line routes. Labor wants to transform Sunshine train station into a transport \u201csuper hub\u201d. Credit: Joe Armao By making these changes, V/Line trains will converge more simply onto regional rail tracks towards Southern Cross Station while suburban services from the airport, Sunbury and eventually Melton will funnel onto the same path directly into the Metro Tunnel. V/Line services that are currently forced to skip Sunshine because of capacity constraints will all be able to stop at the station.\n\nThis is why it is being touted as a regional \u201csuper hub\u201d where a passenger from Bendigo headed to Geelong would always be able to transfer trains without having to travel into the CBD. Other improvements include the extension of high-capacity signalling, used for Metro Tunnel services, past West Footscray and out to Sunshine, allowing trains to run much closer together and more frequently. An electrified Melton line will also have high-capacity signalling in sections. The project adds a connection point in the network that means suburban Melton trains can plug into the new system without significant further work around Sunshine. Opposition transport spokeswoman Bridget McKenzie on the campaign trail this month with Peter Dutton, announcing the Coalition\u2019s plans for airport rail. Credit: James Brickwood The federal opposition\u2019s plan for the precinct does not specifically include the Melton electrification, new track pair or rail bridges, but would preserve improvements for regional passengers outlined in the Airport Rail business case. This document proposed adding an extra platform for V/Line services.\n\nVictorian Transport Minister Gabrielle Williams told The Age the disruptive nature of the project meant it needed to be done in one go, with Sunshine the most complex part of the network outside the CBD. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly short-sighted. It will set the west back significantly ... You would be putting back Melton electrification by over 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is one of Australia\u2019s fastest growing regions. You can\u2019t plan for more services along that corridor, and the Wyndham Vale corridor as well, unless you do this work to make that happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think westies who live on this side of town, whether it be in the regions or in the suburbs, deserve a half-baked option.\u201d The Victorian government first proposed the electrification of the Melton line in 2018, but since then, the region is yet to receive a firm commitment on when it would be delivered.\n\nLoading Infrastructure Victoria this year has recommended work on the project begin by 2030, warning the Western Freeway will be over capacity in the next five to six years, and crowding on peak-hour Melton trains will increase by 50 per cent between 2031 and 2041. A Liberal spokesperson said there were serious questions around the $4 billion proposal and if elected the Coalition would \u201cassess the business case, projected works, and the cost of the proposed Sunshine Station redevelopment to ensure infrastructure funds are being spent prudently\u201d. \u201cThe cost of upgrades at Sunshine station at present is being driven by the Allan government\u2019s SRL gold-plated scoping requirements,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Coalition will not progress the Suburban Rail Loop.\u201d",

But middle class people, small business people, professional people, farmers, artisans, those sorts of people have no one to look after them. So that was the original base of the Liberal Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was a strong advocate of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act - more commonly known as the 'White Australia Policy'.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 1966, the Liberal party changed laws, paving the way to abolish the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party is considered to be the more conservative of the two major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd since the party is more politically conservative than well, liberal, the name might seem a bit confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst in other parts of the world the parties that oppose labour are often named conservative parties, George Brandis says that isn't what the original party was about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of the various options that Menzies had in choosing the name of his new party, he avoided calling it the Conservative Party, because he wasn't a conservative, he was a classical liberal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Sheppard says there is a conservative element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's two core streams of the Liberal Party, and one is what we would call liberal, but we often call that small 'l' liberal. What we mean there is a genuine belief that government is not here to help you, that you are your best advocate, that you should you can best decide how to live your life, and the less the government does, the better. The conservative stream of the Liberal Party does think that government is okay. They're much less resistant to the idea that government can solve our problems. But what they are less happy about are things like same sex marriage, open borders, you know, international students. They want a smaller, quieter Australia that looks more like it did in the 1960s. It's an incredibly at times, different set of principles that the Liberal Party is trying to manage. Under Peter Dutton, the party feels quite conservative. It feels like a party that just wants us to live quietly, does not want to rock the boat too much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther well-known Liberal party policies include:\n\n\n\n\n\nResettling Vietnamese refugees after the Vietnam war in 1976\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing, yours truly, the Special Broadcasting Service in 1977\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing in tougher gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd creating Operation Sovereign Borders in 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the government has done is stop the boats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sheppard says the party would be proud of its economic achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Liberalization of the economy, you know, the ability for anyone in the middle class or working class to move up in society, to own their own business, to go to university if they wish, to live the kind of life that they choose that isn't tied to their occupation or to what their parents did. They would say that is their core achievement over the last 30 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the parties best known leaders include Harold Holt, who famously went missing in the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here is a news flash from the Herald Sun newsroom. An intense land, air, and sea search is continuing near Portsea's back beach for Prime Minister, Mr Holt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n...And John Howard, the second longest serving Prime Minister of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party was last in government in 2022 - and Scott Morrison was the last Liberal Party Prime Minister of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton is current leader, and will be the Prime Minister if the coalition wins the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's been a politician for 25 years, and before then was a police officer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Party teams up with the Nationals in a coalition to form government.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Brandis describes it as...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A functional relationship. It's a necessary relationship. The National Party, though, is a very different beast from the Liberal Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis election the Liberal Party's slogan is 'get Australia back on track', with policies including.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Building Australia's first nuclear reactor\n\n\n\n\n\n- Being tough on crime\n\n\n\n\n\n- Reducing wasteful spending, including cutting public service jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n- And reducing migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how does the party stack up to its original manifesto?\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty well, says Dr Sheppard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Weirdly, I think the Liberal Party is probably closer to its original party than the Labor Party is, even though they've never had a strong sense of purpose, necessarily, apart from opposing Labor, there's always been tension between conservatives and liberals inside the Liberal Party. That was the case in 1944 when the party was founded and its the case today.\"\n\n\n\n",

And I just had a passion for commerce, so I thought it was best to combine both of them\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that places Anandikaa among just 37 per cent of women enrolled in university STEM courses nationwide. She hopes to inspire others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'd really love to be a role model for all those women and just people in minority backgrounds and immigrant backgrounds, which is predominantly where I'm from, Western Sydney.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared by Sydney University\u2019s Associate Vice President Shane Griffin, who\u2019s spent almost two years developing a new school-to-university STEM pipeline, targeting young women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's no other program that's supporting students through their high school years, both in outreach and financially and then into university as well. So, it is a long-term project to make a substantial difference to a serious number of people. We're looking at putting out an additional sort of 300 plus graduates out into the workforce. We're just getting started, but it's a really exciting project for us .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s all thanks to a $100-million dollar donation from tech founder Robin Khuda, who recently sold his data centre business, as Shane Griffin explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRobin is an international student himself from Bangladesh. Robin has seen a lack of diversity in his company and found it difficult to find female engineers and scientists.Employers everywhere have said for a long time there aren't enough women completing STEM degrees. So, to be able to support that and to widen that pool is really fantastic\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShane Griffin says the donation is one of the most significant targeting women in STEM worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the largest donation the university's ever received and as far as we are aware, the largest donation supporting women in STEM and focused on students and local students and their outcomes. So, the university's incredibly grateful.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-decade project is due to begin outreach from July this year, eventually reaching 40,000 high school students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first pilot scholars are expected to enrol at Sydney University in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a move welcomed by Sally-Ann Williams, CEO of Cicada innovations and chair of the federal government\u2019s recent Pathway to Diversity in STEM review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI absolutely commend Robin Khuda and the University of Sydney for taking a very intentional approach to thinking about how they are going to work on changing the ratio of the number of women in engineering and computing and in STEM degrees. And it's very pleasing because that was one of the key recommendations in our review.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Sally-Ann Williams says more work is needed to boost diversity across government and private sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's still a really large gap in some of the STEM fields in Australia for participation of women and other underrepresented people, and that is primarily in the areas of engineering and largely in computing as well. It's actually critical that we're more diverse in the STEM sector - diversity of thought and lived experience, which includes backgrounds such as gender and socioeconomics, regional versus rural versus city. Research shows that diverse teams do create better outcomes and higher success metrics for companies and for government by the way, in policy. And it's because all points of view are considered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Anandikaa Ramesh, who expects to finish her engineering and commerce degrees in 2028, the goal is a career in financial technology. She hopes more women will soon join her.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Each year, Jewish families around the world gather to mark Passover \u2014 an eight-day festival that commemorates the liberation of the Jewish people from slavery in ancient Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while the themes of Pesach (the Hebrew word for Passover) are shared, the way the festival is celebrated can vary widely, depending on where a Jewish family comes from.\n\n\n\n\n\nElana Benjamin is a Jewish Australian writer of Indian-Iraqi heritage. She's also a co-founder of Sephardi Mizrahi Voices Australia, an organisation seeking to raise awareness of the traditions, culture and history of Jews from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that growing up, she rarely saw her Sephardi Mizrahi Jewish culture reflected back at her \u2014 but Passover gives her an opportunity to reconnect with her identity and family.\n\n\n\nWhat is Passover?\n\nPassover is a major Jewish holiday that celebrates the biblical story of the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, it starts on the evening of Saturday 12 April and ends on Sunday 20 April.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe festival commemorates the birth of the Jewish nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe holiday involves a series of rituals, with each one representing a different part of the exodus story.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Seder?\n\nCentral to Passover is the Seder, a ceremonial meal held on the first night (or the first two nights in the diaspora), where families gather to retell the exodus story through symbolic food, prayers and songs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the composition of the meal varies in each region, the Seder is comprised of three core elements: unleavened bread, bitter herbs like horseradish, celery, and cos lettuce, and a bone.\n\n\n\nThe Seder plate is steep in symbolic foods representing the story of Jewish exodus from Egypt. Source: Getty / Portland Press Herald The bread recalls the haste with which the Israelites had to flee, meaning they could not leaven their bread (make it rise); the herbs symbolise the harshness of slavery; and the bone represents sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\nA hard-boiled egg tends to feature, representing sacrifice and embodying hope and consolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalty water pays homage to the slaves' tears, and a fruit paste symbolises the mortar with which the Jewish people made bricks.\n\n\n\nWhat else happens during Passover?\n\nFor the duration of Passover, some Jewish people avoid eating or owning chametz \u2014 any food made from fermented grains like wheat, barley, rye, oats or spelt. This includes everyday staples such as bread, pasta, beer and most cakes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn preparation, these households undergo intensive cleaning to remove any trace of chametz, a tradition rooted in the biblical story where the Israelites left Egypt in such haste they didn\u2019t have time to let their bread rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep kosher for Passover, some families use a separate set of kitchen utensils, or they may kasher their regular ones using boiling water or fire to make them suitable for the holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\nKosher describes any food that adheres to a strict set of dietary rules in Judaism, while kasher means to make something kosher for use.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people attend synagogue services throughout the week, and families often take the opportunity to spend time together, sharing meals or taking children on outings. Community organisations also step in, distributing food packages to support those in need.\n\n\n\nElana Benjamin is a Jewish-Australian writer of Indian-Iraqi heritage. Passover gives her the opportunity to celebrate her Sepahrdi-Mizrahi Jewish identity. Source: Supplied\n\n'Not one way to be Jewish'\n\nBenjamin grew up in an Australia, where Jewish identity was often \"Ashkenormative\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Back then, diversity wasn\u2019t a word that was used,\" she says. \"The whole community was very focused on the Ashkenazi story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAshkenazi Jews are those with roots in Central and Eastern Europe, with many being the descendants of Holocaust survivors. The Jewish community in Australia is mostly comprised of Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Benjamin's Indian and Iraqi background means that she is part of two distinct Jewish diasporas \u2014 Sephardi (with roots in Spain and Portugal) and Mizrahi (with roots in the Middle East and North Africa) \u2014 and her Seder table reflects that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For so many years, I didn\u2019t see the Sephardi Mizrahi foods of my community reflected back to me,\" she explained.\n\n\n\nThere are so many different ways to be Jewish and there's so much beauty in the different traditions. Elana Benjamin\n\nWhile Ashkenazi Jews make the sweet side dish charoset from grated apple, nuts and wine, Benjamin's family uses halek, a thick syrup made of dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My dad used to soak the dates, squeeze them through muslin cloth, then boil it up so it would thicken. It was really labour intensive,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of her recipes blend Indian and Jewish influences, like a Passover bread pudding made of matzo meal, a substitute for flour or breadcrumbs made with unleavened bread.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Ashkenazi Jews might use horseradish on the Seder plate, Benjamin\u2019s family uses cos lettuce, like many Iraqi Jews. Instead of dipping parsley into salt water, they dip celery leaves into lemon juice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd unlike Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardi Jews can eat rice during Passover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every Jewish person I have ever met is like, 'Oh, you\u2019re Sephardi? You can eat rice on Pesach? You\u2019re so lucky!',\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin says food is just one part of the rich cultural variation that exists within global Jewish communities. \"There\u2019s not one way to be Jewish,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so many different ways to be Jewish and there's so much beauty in the different traditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also encourages people to adopt different Jewish traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Persian Jews, for example, during Deyenu [a traditional song sung during Passover], they hit each other with shallots or leeks to replicate the whipping of the Jews of the slaves by the Egyptians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's no reason that if you're not a Persian Jew that you couldn't do that in your Seder. They're really fun, beautiful traditions.\"\n\n\n\nNot just tradition\n\nWhile Passover holds deep religious meaning, for Benjamin, it\u2019s the sense of family and continuity that keeps her coming back to the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s probably my least favourite of the chagim [holiday],\" she admits. \"I loved it as a child, but as an adult, it is just so much work \u2014 so much cleaning and cooking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the joy of gathering with family and honouring the past outweighs the stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But at the same time, I think it's important to keep that alive and to feel that sense of connection to Jewish history and tradition and past generations \u2014 that's why I do it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that sense of connection and belonging and family is really what I love about it, rather than the technical religious aspects of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's something really special about coming together with family and telling the story and signing the Iraqi tunes.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Beijing on Friday increased its tariffs on US imports to 125 per cent, hitting back against US President Donald Trump's decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145 per cent and raising the stakes in a trade war that threatens to upend global supply chains.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the turmoil unleashed by Trump's tariffs showed few signs of easing, with markets tumbling and foreign leaders puzzling how to respond to the biggest disruption to the world trade order in decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nA brief reprieve for battered stocks seen after Trump decided to pause duties for dozens of countries for 90 days quickly dissipated, as attention returned to his escalating trade war with China that has fuelled global recession fears.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal stocks fell, the dollar slid and a sell-off in US government bonds picked up pace on Friday, reigniting fears of fragility in the world's biggest bond market. Gold, a safe haven for investors in times of crisis, scaled a record high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Recession risk is much, much higher now than it was a couple weeks ago,\" said Adam Hetts, global head of multi-asset at investment company Janus Henderson.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How Australia could benefit from a US-China trade war\n\nUS treasury secretary Scott Bessent tried to assuage sceptics by telling a cabinet meeting that more than 75 countries wanted to start trade negotiations. Trump himself expressed hope of a deal with China, the world's No.2 economy by nominal GDP, but the world's No.1 in terms of purchasing power parity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the uncertainty in the meantime extended some of the most volatile trading since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian indices mostly followed Wall Street lower on Friday. In Europe, China's latest tariff hike sent stocks lower, leaving the STOXX 600 index down more than 1 per cent on the day and set for another drop this week, one of its most volatile on record.\n\n\n\n\n\nBessent shrugged off the renewed market turmoil on Thursday and said striking deals with other countries would bring certainty.\n\n\n\nThe US and Vietnam have agreed to begin formal trade talks, the White House said. The Southeast Asian manufacturing hub is prepared to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped to the United States via its territory in the hope of avoiding tariffs, Reuters news agency reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, has set up a trade task force that hopes to visit Washington next week.\n\n\n\nCould there be a 'China deal'?\n\nAs Trump suddenly paused his \"reciprocal\" tariffs on other countries hours after they came into effect earlier this week, he ratcheted up duties on Chinese imports as punishment for Beijing's initial move to retaliate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has now imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods of 145 per cent since taking office, a White House official said.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina hit back with new tariffs on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The US imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international and economic trade rules, basic economic laws and common sense and is completely unilateral bullying and coercion,\" China's finance ministry said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeijing also dismissed Trump's mounting brinkmanship as a \"joke\" and a \"numbers game\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The United States' imposition of round upon round of abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics,\" the ministry said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the US continues to play the tariff numbers game, China will ignore it,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How can trillions just disappear? What you may not know about the stock market\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he thought the United States could make a deal with China and said he respected Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In a true sense he's been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we'll end up working out something that's very good for both countries,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nXi, in his first public remarks on Trump's tariffs, told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing on Friday that China and the European Union should \"jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying,\" China's state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are no winners in a trade war,\" the Chinese leader told his guest, adding that by acting together, the world's second-largest economy and the 27-strong European trade bloc could help uphold \"the global rules-based order\".\n\n\n\nEuropean authorities estimate the impact of the US tariffs on the region's economy would total 0.5 per cent to 1.0 per cent of GDP. Given the EU economy as a whole is forecast to grow 0.9 per cent this year, according to the European Central Bank, the US tariffs could tip the EU into recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's decision for a 90-day suspension on tariffs gave room for only a \"fragile pause\", French President Emmanuel Macron said, partly because tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars remained, as well as across-the-board 10 per cent duties.\n\n\n\n\n\nFragile, also, \"because this 90-day pause means 90 days of uncertainty for all our businesses, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond,\" Macron said on X.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a scenario that seems taken from a nightmare; a woman, giving birth to a child that isn't her own.\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility clinic Monash IVF confirms a patient at their clinic received an embryo that didn't belong to her, resulting in the birth of a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says it became aware of the incident in February this year, when the child's birth parents requested to transfer their remaining embryos to another IVF provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the clinic counted the number of embryos, it found an additional one that belonged to the birth parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn investigation then found a human error was made when transferring the embryo, despite what the clinic claimed were \"strict laboratory safety protocols\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Monash IVF Chief Executive Michael Knaap apologises for the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Monash I-V-F, I want to say how truly sorry I am for what has happened. All of us at Monash I-V-F are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved. We will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time. Since becoming aware of this incident, we have undertaken additional audits and we're confident that this is an isolated incident. We are reinforcing all our safeguards across our clinics \u2013 we also commissioned an independent investigation and are committed to implementing its recommendations in full.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash IVF says it has commissioned an independent investigation by Fiona McLeod, a senior counsel at the Independent Bar in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to its annual report, Monash IVF's total revenue for the 2024 Financial Year was $255 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand, which is responsible for the national standards in assisted reproductive technology, says it is aware of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, its spokesperson says while incidents of this nature are rare, it expects a thorough response from Monash IVF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Incidents like this require the highest standards of transparency \u2013 while protecting patient privacy \u2013 along with rigorous investigation, and a sector-wide commitment to learning and improvement. The trust patients place in our profession is sacred, and we must continually earn it through clear governance, shared responsibility, and action. We ask that the privacy of the families involved is respected during this time, as they work through what is undoubtedly a complex and personal situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand, in 2021, over 18,500 Australian babies were born in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Units.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ying Li is a Sydney-based fertility specialist at Genea Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says an incident of this kind is very rare, and he has not seen any similar cases in the past decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality is, when embryos are created and used there are multiple checks in place. So when the embryos were initially created, there are checks, when the embryos are labelled and stored, there are checks, and then there are further checks when the embryos come to use. The organisations are mandated to audit their own identification process each year, and then each organisation and clinic is subject to an external audit every year for accreditation to practice IVF in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Li says besides the economic and psychological harm to both families, the incident may also lead to a complicated legal battle when it comes to parenting and custody arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Under Australian law, genetics really doesn't determine parentage, it's the birth mother and the birth parents to determine parentage, so whoever give birth to the child is the legal mother or father of that child. And that creates a whole lot of ethical, social disturbance that end up evils for families involved and for children involved.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, IVF services are regulated by individual states and territories, but the sector is still subjected to federal laws and national ethical guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Queensland, the sector adopted self-regulation for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Queensland government launched an investigation into the state's licenced assisted reproductive technology providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt identified what it called \"significant systemic issues\" relating to the services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the report, Queensland parliament proposed and passed the state's first law on assisted reproductive technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also established the donor conception information register, which will hold details about the donor conception procedures in the state in which a live birth occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Ian Freckelton is the co-director of Studies, Health and Medical Law at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there is no legal precedent in Australia for this kind of case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There has been litigation to do with the destruction of gametes, and there was by facilities that has some. But nothing comparable to this. What's taken place is clearly a breach of duty of care, or put it another way, negligence, and so should an action be brought by either set of parents, that will forge new ground.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Freckelton says it could be useful to have a federal law to oversee the sector, rather than leaving it to the states and territories.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Coalition will back Australian families who \"don't want or cannot afford\" an electric vehicle (EV), vowing to scrap penalties for vehicle manufacturers in their latest cost of living pitch to voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES) for manufacturers, set to come into effect on 1 July, will drive up the price of a Toyota RAV4 by $9,700, and the cost of a Ford Ranger ute by $14,400.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton said if elected, the Coalition would repeal penalties due to apply to vehicle manufacturers that don't meet the standards, and will pursue vehicle emissions in a \"responsible\" way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want vehicle emissions standards to be responsible. Of course, we want cleaner fuel. But I want Australians to be able to afford to live,\" Dutton said in Perth on Friday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's why we're not going to allow Labor's ute-and-car tax. We're going to repeal it.\"\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has spruiked both his fuel excise cut and a change to fuel efficiency standards at a car dealership in Kalamunda, Perth. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas It builds on the Coalition's promise to save families hundreds by temporarily cutting the fuel excise from about 50 cents to 25 cents per litre.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese labelled the Coalition's policy \"nonsensical\", arguing it removes incentives for fuel-efficient cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I find it extraordinary that Peter Dutton, who says he cares about the price of fuel, doesn't want people to have more fuel-efficient cars, which reduce the costs of filling up their car,\" Albanese told reporters in Darwin.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is NVES, and how will it affect the price of vehicles?\n\n\n\nWhat is the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard?\n\nNVES was legislated by the government in 2024 and comes into effect on 1 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVES sets a carbon emission target for a manufacturer's fleet and penalises vehicles polluting over that threshold, which encourages them to ship lower polluting vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars, to Australia.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition vows to abolish penalties on cars that don't meet fuel efficiency standards\n\nThe emissions targets become more stringent over the coming years while the industry adjusts, with eventual fines of $100 for every gram over the target to be paid from 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Wood, Energy and Climate Change program director at the Grattan Institute, told SBS News the scheme is designed to \"encourage more efficient new vehicles\" that use less petrol and produce fewer emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the scheme is expected to drive better efficiency standards across petrol and diesel vehicles, as well as encourage more EVs into the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're actually seeing is cleaner, more efficient and increasingly affordable cars,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, of course, that means that if you want to buy a vehicle that is neither of those \u2014 not clean or as efficient \u2014 then you will progressively be paying more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTransport makes up 21 per cent of Australia's emissions, according to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. Two-thirds of these are due to passenger and light vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood questioned how the Coalition intended to achieve its net-zero emissions by 2050 target without imposing some penalties on the vehicle industry.\n\n\n\nHow does Australia compare to the rest of the world?\n\nWhen the Albanese government unveiled its policy last year, it argued that Australia had become a dumping ground for less efficient petrol vehicles, ultimately costing voters more at the bowser.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment analysis suggested manufacturers would import more efficient vehicles, which are already available in markets like the European Union, saving Australians an average of $1,000 a year.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Vehicle Council says the industry is changing, with more EVs and even a hybrid-ute now available to consumers at a cheaper price. Source: Getty / Ralf Hahn The availability of lower polluting vehicles was also highlighted by the former Coalition government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The US, UK and EU, they all have fuel efficiency standards for their vehicles,\" the Coalition's former environment minister Josh Frydenberg, who pursued vehicle efficiency standards, said in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In fact, 80 per cent of the world's light passenger vehicle fleet has these standards.\"\n\n\n\nWill this drive up the price of your ute or EV?\n\nTony Weber, chief executive of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, said it supported a more \"achievable\" fuel efficiency standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peak body argues the targets are \"too stringent\" and require \"a very high proportion of EV sales\", which does not reflect current consumer sentiments and preferences for vehicles such as utes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the government needed to pursue \"a sensible approach that delivers vehicles that consumers want, and in the timeframe that makes a meaningful difference to the CO2 outcome\".\n\n\n\nAman Gaur, head of legal policy and advocacy at EVC, said many people thought utes could never be electric, but \"we're seeing a really viable and cost-competitive option\". Source: Supplied / BYD Some makers have already flagged they would either pass the financial cost of fines down to consumers, or remove popular models from sale to minimise penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) said the policy is already working, pointing to an increase in the number of EVs available to consumers, with over 30 types now offered.\n\n\n\n\n\nAman Gaur, head of legal policy and advocacy at EVC, said this had driven down the cost of EVs, with models now available at a cost below $40,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has also led to the introduction of Australia's first plug-in hybrid ute: The BYD Shark 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaur said many people thought utes could never be electric, but \"we're seeing a really viable and cost-competitive option\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The average Australian benefits because they get access to more competition,\" he told SBS News. \"Prices go down, but then they [also] save money on their day-to-day running costs.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How new fuel rules could save Australian drivers thousands of dollars\n\nGaur compared the benefits to an energy-efficient washing machine, which uses less electricity and drives down power bills. He said similarly, vehicle emission standards would reduce the amount of petrol used and offer cost of living relief for households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If manufacturers don't need to bring in more fuel-efficient petrol hybrid and electric cars, they can continue to bring in their most inefficient cars.\"\n\n\n\n",

This one happens to be particularly tumultuous is, in my view, to call, you know, called Chicken Little. The sky isn't falling. Yes, it's stormy. Yes, there's a lot of moving parts. The dust has not settled. It will settle, and there are enduring American interests in making AUKUS work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Blaxland says if it is true, this would suggest that the negotiations predated the previous U-S government's administration under Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has spoken about reports in The Australian newspaper of an alleged terror plot in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, a 16-year old Brisbane student was arrested and charged in August, after a joint counter-terrorism investigation by the Federal and Queensland police.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton - who was allegedly a target of the teenager addressed the matter today - commending the Australian Federal Police for keeping his family safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm incredibly grateful to the AFP that my family are kept safe. I've never felt unsafe one day in this job particularly with the protection from the AFP and it hasn't stopped me from doing anything..this campaign, I take the advise of the federal police but ultimately, I think this job is about a test of character - until you have the strength of character regardless of what's thrown at you to deal with the issues and to act in our country's best interest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier today Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also confirmed he reached out to the Opposition leader over the terror plot incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says there is no place whatsoever in politics for such threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a fact that the number of threats that the number of threats that have been made to parliamentarians has increased in recent times and that has been recorded on by the appropriate authorities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian sprint star Gout Gout says achieving ten seconds twice in one night is definitely a boost to his confidence level.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout lit up the Australian Athletics Championships in Perth with a wind-assisted run of 9.99 seconds in the 100 metre sprint - twice in one night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is what I feel like Australia needs you know, this is what we wake up in the morning for, this is what we train for - and I couldn't ask for anything better. And just the great crowds and everyone getting around is definitely great so hopefully we can get a lot more people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for Gout, who is competing in the Under-20's men's category, the tailwind was two-point-six metres per second [[2.6m/s]], which means his run didn't count as an official time.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australia's AUKUS deal \u2014 estimated to cost between $268 billion and $368 billion \u2014 is facing pressure as a United States senator says the country is \"having trouble getting these ships and subs on time, on budget\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US and the United Kingdom have both launched reviews into the multi-billion-dollar submarine dea l amid production concerns and steel tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder AUKUS, Australia is set to acquire three nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines from the US in the early 2030s, before a new fleet of boats is built for delivery from the 2040s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal lasts until 2075, and countries can cancel the contract with one year's notice.\n\n\n\nSteel tariffs could create problems\n\nUS senator Tim Kaine, the most senior Democrat on a Senate subcommittee on seapower, reportedly told an AUKUS dinner on Wednesday night (local time) submarine construction is facing time and budget setbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said about a third of the steel and aluminium that went into ships and submarines came from the Canada and the United Kingdom, which like Australia, now face tariffs on their exports to the US .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Increase those prices and there\u2019s going to be a problem. So the first concern that I have about the tariff regime is it\u2019s a national sales tax that is really going to blitz us,\" Kaine said at the dinner in Washington, which was hosted by former Australian defence minister\u2013turned\u2013lobbyist Christopher Pyne, according to Nine Newspapers.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What to know about tariffs and how they work\n\nDavid Andrews, senior manager for policy and engagement at the Australian National University's National Security College, said AUKUS would likely become costlier, but it would be hard for the federal government to do much about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no Plan B for AUKUS there, isn\u2019t a ready-made replacement or off-the-shelf option,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these external factors, like tariffs, are not within the control of the Australian government to shape.\"\n\n\n\nWill it increase costs?\n\nAndrews said the minimum budgeted cost of $268 billion for the deal would likely rise, but that defence projects have built-in contingencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An increase of steel tariffs would be a huge concern for any project. But there are measures and contingencies in place to allow for that,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In this case there is 50 per cent contingency built into the estimated costs, to cover changes in material costs or delays.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the minimum spend could increase, Andrews said the maximum quote of $368 billion could remain the same.\n\n\n\nHe said defence projects typically have a contingency of at least 10 per cent included in budgeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrews said steel tariffs shouldn\u2019t impact the cost of the three Virginia-class submarines the US will send to Australia next decade, as they are already built.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if the production costs of new submarines were to increase, the US could ask for more funding from Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US is currently reviewing the deal to scrutinise its cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrews said the review, being conducted by Elon Musk, head of the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficienc y, is part of the procedural process and \"makes sense\" for expensive government projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is common place to review funding, the current US administration has made a number of large cuts to government spending.\n\n\n\nCould Donald Trump scrap AUKUS?\n\nIf Trump chooses to withdraw from the deal, then AUKUS would be scrapped, which an international relations expert said could happen if the US president decides it compromises US \"national security or deterrence needs\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The US is already facing challenges in meeting its own production targets for nuclear submarines, raising concerns about its ability to deliver on AUKUS commitments,\" Dr Minran Liu, from the University of Queensland's school of political science and international studies, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AUKUS is inherently a bet on the future of the US. One that carries serious risks for Australia, including uncertainty over submarine construction, doubts about America's long-term commitment to the Indo-Pacific, and unpredictability in US domestic politics.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The billion-dollar problem that neither Albanese nor Dutton wants to become a big issue\n\nLiu said Australia has little say or control over US domestic policies, meaning the future of AUKUS is in Trump's hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrews acknowledged that Trump has been \"unpredictable\" in his dealings with other nations but said his cabinet strongly supports AUKUS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The key figures in his government, his secretary of state, the secretary of defence, and the national security advisor have all expressed their support for AUKUS,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They see value in it, they see a strategic logic that makes sense.\"\n\n\n\nAlbanese 'confident' AUKUS will go ahead\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke to reporters on Friday about AUKUS, and said that despite the steel tariffs, he was confident the deal would continue under Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m confident about AUKUS because I\u2019ve had those first-hand discussions with the president of the United States, and also with more than 100 members of congress, in the senate during my state visit to the United States,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton was defence minister when the AUKUS deal was signed between Australia's Coalition government and the Democratic administration in Washington DC.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told reporters on Friday that \"President Biden didn't want the deal\" at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Americans hadn't shared their nuclear secrets since the 1950s, and it was a significant outcome, and we had worked on that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton said it demonstrated his party's ability to deal with \"whatever comes our way after the election.\"\n\n\n\n",

Miller\u2019s dad Anthony was a nationally ranked swimmer and good rugby player, too, in the same Brisbane school team as John Eales and as a flanker at Norths. Gail Miller (back row, far left) was a member of the Australian women\u2019s water polo team. Credit: Steve Baccon Anthony hardly a black sheep of the Miller clan, though: he was last year appointed chief executive officer of Westpac. \u201cHe is a very high achiever, too,\u201d Miller said \u201cMy dad was a very competitive swimmer, he didn\u2019t quite crack the Olympics, but he was a massive workhorse. So I definitely had a lot of people in my life that showed me the value of work ethic, especially in the sporting realm. And it made me believe, \u2018oh, it\u2019s possible, I can go do that too\u2019.\u201d\n\nMiller was one of those Energizer bunny kids who excelled at gymnastics and dancing from a young age. It wasn\u2019t unusual to be out the door at 6am and back at 9pm. Desiree Miller performing as a young state squad gymnast In the gym, Miller was a state representative on the floor, beam, bars and vault, and in the dance studio, she performed in ballet, tap, jazz, hip-hop and contemporary disciplines. \u201cWe used to travel around the world every couple of years (for dance),\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe competed in Spain and in America, we even performed at Disneyland. I\u2019ve performed at Disneyland three times. It was amazing. I got to travel the world.\u201d\n\nGoing to school in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, and in Hong Kong during her teenage years, Miller also somehow found time to play other sports. Lots of them. \u201cI was a diver, a tennis player, I played soccer, did a bit of basketball, I was too short for that. And netball and hockey, too - just a bunch of sports,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt (dance) helped me translate so much, especially whenever I tried a new sport, I was always balanced and coordinated. Same with gymnastics, I had that power and strength. So when I made the turn to rugby, it was kind of combining everything - and adding the contact part that I was missing out on for all those years.\u201d Desi Miller scoring her third try in the 2024 Super W grand final. Credit: Getty Images In mid-2021, with COVID-19 still stalking the world, Miller was looking for a new team sport and to make some new mates. A friend suggested rugby and Miller rolled up at Easts where she was introduced to the game via sevens, and then 15s. It was love at first tackle bag.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018this is amazing\u2019. I absolutely love it,\u201d Miller said. Miller\u2019s pace and strength immediately saw her stand out for Easts, and halfway through 2022, she was invited to train with the NSW women\u2019s sevens squad. That turned into 15-a-side squad training with the Waratahs\u2019 Super W squad, and in 2023, Miller made her debut for the Tahs against the Force. In the same year, Miller was chosen for the Wallaroos squad and made her debut against England. In the years since, Miller has become a mainstay for NSW and Australia. Her statistics make for eye-popping reading. In 17 games for NSW, Miller has scored 17 tries, made 35 linebreaks and 28 offloads, and beaten a whopping 73 defenders. In 12 Tests, Miller has scored 7 tries, 24 linebreaks and beaten 48 defenders.\n\nThis year, the Super Rugby women\u2019s competition saw several Aussie sevens stars switch to 15s for a few games, in an attempt to make the 2025 Rugby World Cup squad.

But the testament of how well the incumbent Wallaroos wingers, Miller and Maya Stewart (who was the Wallaroos\u2019 MVP last year) are both playing, Levi currently wouldn\u2019t unseat either. A bench role is the more likely scenario. Loading",

But, if you use that same password elsewhere, it could lead to significant trouble.\n\nLoading\n\nCrooks will load those billions of credentials into an automated system that throws them rapid-fire at services that do have important info, such as financial services. Those services should absolutely have protections against this. If they start getting thousands of different login requests from the same IP address, or several login attempts on the same account from different IP addresses, that should be flagged. Hunt and others have also created protocols that can check passwords to see if they\u2019ve been caught up in a breach, and many companies use these so they can prompt users to change passwords before an attack occurs.\n\nBut an ironclad way to avoid being a victim of credential stuffing is to not reuse passwords, and particularly to have a unique password for any service that holds your money or sensitive data. There are many password managers that will keep all your unique passwords safe and encrypted, and some also integrate the technology that can tell you if one of your passwords has been found in data sold on the dark web, so you can change it.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\nThis story is part of the April 12 edition of Good Weekend. See all 12 stories .\n\nTowards the end of summer each year, I wind up at the doctor\u2019s office. It was a standing joke with my GP that each January he would tell me to wear earplugs when swimming, and I\u2019d respond that I couldn\u2019t hear him until after he\u2019d applied a high-pressure surgical piston to blast out the accumulated gunk.\n\nI swim a lot, which is a diplomatic way of saying that I enjoy wading into the crisp ocean and ducking my head under a few waves that are mostly waist-height. When you are lucky enough to grow up near the sea, you partake of this liberally. Dips before work. During lunch. At knock-off. There is nothing like the bracing freshness of a long-awaited plunge.\n\nBut the bones in my ears are not like yours. Since my early 20s they have been growing over, fusing into twisted tree roots that are perilously close to my brain. This is called external auditory canal exostoses and the net result is water gets trapped deep in my ears, calcifies into salty wax and renders me practically deaf.\n\nMy GP was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer early last year and passed away a painfully short time later, just as the ocean started warming up. I was bereft at the news of his death; he had been a friend of the family and a wonderfully selfless man. My father had also been a GP, and both their memorials were thronged with the grief of an extended community that had lost something vital to its very functioning. Doctors do not typically get state funerals but in their outpouring of mourners, their farewells can feel a bit like one. A former patient realises very quickly that they are but one of hundreds, all of whom maintain a distinctly personal relationship with someone who checks their bloods, listens to their chests and, on occasion, peers into their ears.\n\nThose who serve our communities aren\u2019t typically thought about in the same way as family members or friends. But they are crucial totems in our lives.\n\nOnce my doctor knew he was dying, his surgery arranged for my file to be transferred to another practice. A different GP would peruse my previous mental health plans and uncover my penicillin allergy. This should not have felt as strange as it did, like intimate details being passed on to a new lover. We tend to hold the view that certain members of society are with us for life; having them suddenly shut up shop, move towns or onto the next astral plane can be highly distressing.\n\nThose who serve our communities, whether they treat our maladies, tailor our dresses or tame our tresses, aren\u2019t typically thought about in the same way as family members or friends. But they are crucial totems in our lives, keepers of knowledge and secrets and an ongoing, living history to which few others have access. The level of trust placed in my hairdresser three days before my wedding is more than I ever expect from anyone at my bank.",

        "text": "To understand the Sunshine upgrade as proposed by Labor, it helps to think of the project as a level crossing removal or the transformation of a busy road into a freeway. Sunshine sits at the meeting point of multiple regional and suburban rail lines coming from Victoria\u2019s west, including 70 per cent of the V/Line network. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday spruiking the proposed Sunshine station upgrade with Premier Jacinta Allan. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The tracks around the station are like a busy traffic intersection where trains are sometimes forced to wait to get into the correct \u201clane\u201d or reach the platform. The Sunshine project aims to solve these problems by redesigning the network along a six-kilometre stretch of rail so that regional trains, suburban services and freight are kept on their own separate paths. Doing so will make room for 40 trains an hour.\n\nThis includes building a series of rail bridges that will steer trains onto the correct track without having to cut across the path of others. The Level Crossing Removal Project, which has been performing a similar task across 110 different Victorian intersections, is the department delivering the upgrade. A new pair of tracks will also be built between Sunshine and West Footscray to make this untangling process more simple and add capacity for more trains. Sunshine station will be expanded, with two new platforms accommodating these tracks and receiving most V/Line routes. Labor wants to transform Sunshine train station into a transport \u201csuper hub\u201d. Credit: Joe Armao By making these changes, V/Line trains will converge more simply onto regional rail tracks towards Southern Cross Station while suburban services from the airport, Sunbury and eventually Melton will funnel onto the same path directly into the Metro Tunnel. V/Line services that are currently forced to skip Sunshine because of capacity constraints will all be able to stop at the station.\n\nThis is why it is being touted as a regional \u201csuper hub\u201d where a passenger from Bendigo headed to Geelong would always be able to transfer trains without having to travel into the CBD. Other improvements include the extension of high-capacity signalling, used for Metro Tunnel services, past West Footscray and out to Sunshine, allowing trains to run much closer together and more frequently. An electrified Melton line will also have high-capacity signalling in sections. The project adds a connection point in the network that means suburban Melton trains can plug into the new system without significant further work around Sunshine. Opposition transport spokeswoman Bridget McKenzie on the campaign trail this month with Peter Dutton, announcing the Coalition\u2019s plans for airport rail. Credit: James Brickwood The federal opposition\u2019s plan for the precinct does not specifically include the Melton electrification, new track pair or rail bridges, but would preserve improvements for regional passengers outlined in the Airport Rail business case. This document proposed adding an extra platform for V/Line services.\n\nVictorian Transport Minister Gabrielle Williams told The Age the disruptive nature of the project meant it needed to be done in one go, with Sunshine the most complex part of the network outside the CBD. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly short-sighted. It will set the west back significantly ... You would be putting back Melton electrification by over 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is one of Australia\u2019s fastest growing regions. You can\u2019t plan for more services along that corridor, and the Wyndham Vale corridor as well, unless you do this work to make that happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think westies who live on this side of town, whether it be in the regions or in the suburbs, deserve a half-baked option.\u201d The Victorian government first proposed the electrification of the Melton line in 2018, but since then, the region is yet to receive a firm commitment on when it would be delivered.\n\nLoading Infrastructure Victoria this year has recommended work on the project begin by 2030, warning the Western Freeway will be over capacity in the next five to six years, and crowding on peak-hour Melton trains will increase by 50 per cent between 2031 and 2041. A Liberal spokesperson said there were serious questions around the $4 billion proposal and if elected the Coalition would \u201cassess the business case, projected works, and the cost of the proposed Sunshine Station redevelopment to ensure infrastructure funds are being spent prudently\u201d. \u201cThe cost of upgrades at Sunshine station at present is being driven by the Allan government\u2019s SRL gold-plated scoping requirements,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Coalition will not progress the Suburban Rail Loop.\u201d",

        "text": "Unwanted bugs and invasive infestations can become seriously costly for Australian homeowners.\n\nThe Sydney-based pest controller said multiple jobs have led him back to the roof insulation. Source: TikTok/RoachSniper\n\nA pest controller is highlighting the surprising way unwanted bug infestations can make it into your home after receiving multiple call outs to eventually discover outbreaks hiding in a very common material in the roof cavity of Aussie homes.\n\nOn a number of occasions recently, he's discovered suspected drugstore beetles that have seemingly come from contaminated roofing insulation.\n\n\"It's a bit of a common problem with new builds, for people who are getting fresh insulation installed. Sometimes it's tainted from the warehouse, but there's a range of reasons,\" pest controller Christopher James told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nIf you don't find the source, \"they'll run rampant through the house,\" the self-described 'Roach Sniper' said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I've seen jobs where it's been going on for years, that's a long time to have beetles falling through your down lights ... and constantly finding dead beetles in the house.\"\n\nRelated: Harvey Norman bed discovered riddled with invasive bug from China\n\nOn Thursday, he shared a video to his TikTok page, showing an infestation of suspected drugstore beetles inside the roof of a Sydney home.\n\n\"They're coming out of the insulation ... Sometimes these insulation packages are coming from places we're they're tainted,\" he said in the video.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo, he said the agricultural pest is \"pretty widespread\" and is often found in pantry items like grains and oats and \"wherever there is going to be stored food products\" and produce larvae.\n\n\"But it's the second or third job where it's led me back to the insulation\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the NSW Department of Primary Industries, the drugstore beetle and the closely related tobacco or cigarette beetle \"typically lay 100 eggs over their lifespan of, on average, 25 days\".\n\nThe bugs like to live among stored food products where they \"feed internally\". Source: TikTok/RoachSniper\n\n\"Signs of these pesky insects include irregular holes in foodstuff and packaging. Infested material becomes contaminated with pupal cocoons and dead bodies of the short-lived adults,\" the DPI says.\n\n\"Drugstore beetles are commonly found infesting a range of stored products including dried herbs and spices. In addition, as the name suggests, the Cigarette beetle is a pest of cured tobacco.\"\n\nWhether it's ants, booklice, bed bugs, soldier beetles, cockroaches or the dreaded termite, Australians are no stranger to pests becoming unwanted house guests.\n\nWhile it's hard to pin down the exact cost, exterminators and pest experts say bugs and invasive infestations cost Australian homeowners more than $600 million in damage and repairs each year with that number much higher when termite destruction is fully accounted for.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "With the federal election around the corner, candidates are finding innovative ways to get the attention of voters.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Woollahra was not impressed by the tactic. Source: Facebook/Sean Carmichael\n\nEarly voting in the upcoming federal election opens in less than two weeks as petty games of party politics play out in suburbs around the country with some candidates being accused of dirty tricks. Or in this case, kind of the opposite.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Woollahra, in Sydney's affluent eastern suburbs, has slammed his local federal member for advertising her candidacy by washing advertisements into dirty footpaths in the local area, with a stencil and high-grade pressure hose.\n\nCouncillor Sean Carmichael took to social media to condemn the move by 'teal' independent Allegra Spender who currently holds the seat formerly held by Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThe deputy mayor said council enlisted workers to remove what he described as \"nine acts of reverse graffiti\" on Thursday night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This is council property that has been defaced with what is clearly, in substance, graffiti,\" he told Yahoo News.\n\nThe councillor said the advertisements could technically breach rules from the Australian Electoral Commission. \"Well it's not got an authorisation on it ... all election material must have who has authorised it.\"\n\nRelated: Labor, Albanese extend leads in latest election poll\n\nCalling the tactic \"unacceptable\" in a local Facebook group, the deputy mayor complained it was \"quite difficult to remove without industrial grade machinery\".\n\n\"These defaced concrete footpaths are otherwise in satisfactory condition. The implied argument they are dirty and needing cleaning is - in my own view - incredibly cheeky, and does not pass,\" he wrote.\n\nAllegra Spender won the formerly safe Liberal seat at the last election. Source: AAP/Facebook\n\nWhen contacted by Yahoo, Allegra Spender's team questioned the use of local ratepayers' money to remove the messages with further pressure washing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The messages are created with water pressure, that actually cleans dirt off the footpath. It's disappointing that the Liberal Party controlled council is misusing ratepayers' money to remove a political opponent\u2019s messages. The messages are temporary and fade away naturally,\" a campaign spokesperson said.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo, Cr Carmichael said it was not a technique he has ever seen before and hopes it does not become the norm.\n\n\"Do we really need to go down this path, pardon the pun... We just don't need to be doing this,\" he said.\n\nMs Spender entered parliament at the previous federal election in 2022, and was among a wave of so-called teal candidates to dislodge incumbent Liberal members. In the upcoming federal poll, on May 3, some observers suggest independent candidates could even replicate such success in the state of Queensland, including in Peter Dutton's seat of Dickson where he is being challenged by both a strong Labor candidate and independent Ellie Smith. If the latter were to prevail it would be the first time an independent candidate has ever toppled a federal opposition leader.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Down to the wire, Dutton faces fight to hold his own seat\n\nYouth enrolment rate up as record number of Aussies set to vote\n\nA record number of people are expected to have their say in the upcoming election, as candidates get ready to find out where their names will appear on the ballots.\n\nThe number of people enrolled to vote has reached a new high at almost 18,098,797, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) revealed on Friday.\n\nCompared to the 2022 election, about 870,000 more people have been enrolled, representing a five per cent rise.\n\nAccording to the AEC, In the 11 days following the announcement of the election, it added approximately 85,000 new voters to the roll, and helped more than 419,000 other voters to update their enrolment details. It also brought Australia\u2019s youth enrolment rate to 92 per cent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We\u2019re particularly focused on Australia\u2019s youth enrolment rates, and I\u2019m pleased to report that it\u2019s now extremely healthy,\" Australian Electoral Commissioner Jeff Pope said. \"Well done, Australia.\"\n\nwith AAP\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "A tourist travelling around Australia in a van has captured the heart-stopping moment a split-second mistake left him stranded in a remote town \u2014 and the \u201cunreal\u201d beach discovery that finally set him free. Coleman Geiger, an American who has been living in Sydney for the past two years, began his epic trek from Cairns to Perth last month before heading over to Bali.\n\nWhile the first 10 days were plagued by heavy rain, the 28-year-old model and graphic designer was relieved to see sunshine when he reached Broome.\n\nAfter spending a couple of days sightseeing, Coleman told Yahoo News Australia he decided to go for a quick swim on his last morning before heading on to Exmouth \u2014 completely unaware the last-minute decision would almost cost him $1,300 and potentially ruin the rest of his holiday.\n\nThe traveller parked his Juicy Coaster campervan in the car park at Cable Beach and walked down to the water. Before dunking his body into the ocean, he placed his bag on top of a nearby rock and propped his phone on a tripod.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI was only going there just to get the one stupid clip of me running into the water. It came back to bite me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a tote bag, I think I probably had a towel in there and stuff, but I wasn't thinking anything of it, and set my keys on top [of it].\n\nTourist stunned to discover keys have disappeared into the ocean\n\nAfter just 15 minutes, Coleman noticed the tide was rising rapidly. \u201cThe tide was really low and I don\u2019t know why but I just assumed the tide would stay at that level. But then it started to get really big when I was in the ocean, and that\u2019s when the keys fell into the water,\u201d the 28-year-old told Yahoo.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until he had almost returned to the van with his soaking wet bag on his shoulder, that he realised his remote start key, and the AirPods attached to the ring, were missing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI went back to where I was, and they weren\u2019t there. The tide was too high at that point so I gave up looking after about 30 minutes,\u201d he said. At this point, he believed the error could quickly be remedied by ordering a replacement key, but reality set in when a local locksmith and Juicy support worker informed him that could take \u201cat least a week\u201d.\n\nThe traveller said he was quoted about $500 to tow the car from the beach back into town, another $500 for a new key, $150 to \u201cbreak into the van\u201d and at least another $100 on scooters so he could pick up some food \u2014 leaving him with a potentially hefty $1,300 bill.\n\n\u201cThen it was all starting to compile. I have no way to even get into this vehicle. My whole life is in the vehicle,\u201d Geiger said, adding he had parked near signs warning against illegal camping. \u201cAll the anxiety kind of set in.\u201d\n\nLeft with just the shorts, hat and shoes he was wearing at the time, the tourist began to panic, concerned he\u2019d have to not only give up on his road trip, but also miss his flight to Indonesia. A local hostel was able to place him in their emergency room for the day, where he spent the next six hours on the phone to numerous people \u2014 including his mum \u2014 trying to find a quicker resolution.\n\nColeman's heartwarming reaction to finding his keys buried in the sand has amused thousands of people across the world. Source: Coleman Geiger\n\nMan's heartwarming response to shocking find buried in sand\n\nDetermined not to give up, Coleman decided to head back to Cable Beach as the tide retreated later that afternoon, but knew the odds of him finding his keys were \u201cso, so slim\u201d. He had been trying to use his phone to locate his attached AirPods, but they were not registering.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLuckily he was able to remember which rock he had set his belongings on and walked in that direction. \u201cI looked around for like five minutes and I thought \u2018okay, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to find this but I\u2019ll just look\u2019,\u201d he told Yahoo. \u201cI went back to the rock, and maybe 15 to 20 metres away I see this little thing sticking out.\u201d\n\nMiraculously, the Juicy tag attached to his keys was ever so slightly poking out of the sand. The 28-year-old could barely contain his excitement as he bolted over to the spot and pulled the piece of square plastic out of the sand, revealing his lost belongings. Footage shows an incredible gleeful and relieved Coleman jumping in joy after making the one-in-a-million discovery.\n\nAfter opening up the remote start key and cleaning off all the sand, much to his surprise, the van\u2019s engine started. Not only that, but his AirPods appeared to also still be working well. Exhausted from the entire ordeal, the American took himself off for a beer before continuing his journey south the next morning.\n\nA video detailing the tourist\u2019s rollercoaster of emotions has since gone viral, with thousands of viewers from around the world sharing in his luck and relief.\n\n\u201cBuy a lotto ticket,\u201d one person urged. \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier for a stranger on the internet,\u201d another laughed.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
