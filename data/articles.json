        "text": "T\ufeffo most people, $80 billion is an extraordinary amount of money. Where the GST is concerned, though, experts say it's not enough.\n\nThe decision by the Howard government to introduce the goods and services tax was an unpopular one 25 years ago, and it's little surp\ufeffrise politicians today are keen to avoid talking about raising it from its current 10 per cent.\n\nHowever, that's exactly what economists say needs to happen . This is why.\n\nEconomists are calling for the GST to be overhauled. (AFR Louie Douvis)\n\nWhy are there calls to change the GST?\n\nThe federal budget is in a structural deficit and desperately needs more revenue.\n\nAt the same time, government coffers are overly reliant on individual income tax, which accounts for more than half of all taxation revenue, and Treasurer Jim Chalmers has spoken about wanting to reduce tax strain on personal earnings.\n\nIf the government wants to reduce income tax, it doesn't have many options to replace that revenue, much less to do so while returning the budget to surplus.\n\nWinding back negative gearing and capital gains concessions have been ruled out, and a carbon tax \u2013 something proposed by former Treasury secretary Ken Henry \u2013 has proven political suicide in the past.\n\nAt the same time, consumption taxes like the GST cause very little economic damage compared to other options like excises and stamp duties.\n\n\"The GST and taxes like it are a much more efficient way of raising revenue,\" Professor Richard Holden from the University of NSW told 9News last week.\n\n\"They create less distortions, they do less damage to productivity and the economy.\"\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this economic picture is the government's upcoming productivity roundtable.\n\nTo be held next month, Chalmers flagged in a Press Club speech that the roundtable could pave the way for a much-needed overhaul of the tax system \ufeff\u2013 a speech that was quite quickly followed by calls to reform the GST.\n\nJim Chalmers said the government's productivity roundtable could lead to tax overhaul. (Rohan Thomson)\n\nHow does Australia's GST compare to the rest of the world?\n\nWhile there's a perception among Australians that ours is a high-taxing nation, the truth is taxes here are quite low compared to the rest of the world .\n\nThe GST is no exception.\n\nWhile the United States doesn't have a federal consumption tax (it instead has state-based sales taxes) and Canada has a lower rate of 5 per cent, Australia's 10 per cent GST is on the lower end of the global scale.\n\nIt's on par with the consumption taxes levelled in Japan and South Korea, but short of the GST in New Zealand (15 per cent) and of comparative value added taxes (VATs) in the likes of Germany (19 per cent), the United Kingdom (20 per cent) and Ireland (23 per cent).\n\nIt's also below the OECD average of 19.4 per cent.\n\nLittle surprise, then, that the amount of consumption tax Australia collects as a proportion of total revenue is far less than the global average.\n\nWhat could a change look like?\n\nExactly what a\ufeff reformed GST could look like differs from economist to economist, but a common suggestion has been raising it to 15 per cent.\n\nThat's what Holden's proposal is, while at the same time cutting personal income tax and giving every worker a $12,500 GST-free threshold to make sure low earners are better off.\n\nThe point about shielding low-income earners from any ill effects of a GST increase has been made by several economists.\n\n\ufeff\"The GST is one of the most effective ways to tax those on higher incomes, but it affects lower-income earners more,\" Dr Venkat Narayanan from RMIT University said.\n\n\"Why not talk about a 10.5 per cent GST for the next few years and increase it by 0.5 per cent until we get to 15, rather than just straight to a higher percentage?\n\n\"Any reform should consider income taxation... so that any increases to the GST do not disproportionately affect low-income earners.\"\n\nSome measures have been proposed to shield low-income earners from the negative effects of a GST overhaul. (Luis Enrique Ascui/The Age)\n\nAnother option flagged by think tank the Australia Institute, which has found the government has so far collected $231 billion less in GST than what was originally intended, is broadening the tax to remove some exemptions.\n\n\"Higher-income households don't have to pay GST on private schools and private health and can find other ways of avoiding the tax,\" executive director Richard Denniss said.\n\n\"On the other hand, lower-income households are spending more on rent and mortgages, which means they have less money to spend on the things that would generate GST revenue.\n\n\"If the Australian government wants to fill this tax blackhole without hurting low-income households, it could broaden the GST so that it applies to private school fees and private health insurance.\ufeff\"\n\nSo will the government actually increase the GST\ufeff?\n\nProbably not.\n\n\"I think often an increase in the GST is spent three or four times over by the time people are finished with all of the things that they want to do with it,\" Chalmers said when taking questions following his Press Club address.\n\nAnd while the treasurer also called \ufeffto an end to what he called the \"rule-in, rule-out game\", Prime Minister Anthony Albanese couldn't help himself last week.\n\n\"Consumption taxes by definition are regressive in their nature, so that's something that doesn't fit with the agenda,\" he said.",

(GoFundMe)\n\n\"I've been here for six years, all my family are here, and I have a house and a dog.\ufeff I have nowhere to go.\"\n\n\ufeffThe 31-year-old moved to Australia in 2019 on a Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visa, then applied for a \ufeff\ufeffTemporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa in 2023.\n\nIt \ufeffwould allow her to live and work in Australia for up to two years, after which time she'd apply for a Temporary Residence Transition (TRT) Visa to become a permanent resident.\n\nA migration agent told her it was \ufeffa \"clear pathway\" to permanent residency\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nTSS visas are employer sponsored, so Fraser found a small business in Sydney that agreed to sponsor her as a restaurant manager.\n\nAt the time, it was an eligible occupation for that visa.\n\nWant a pay rise? These jobs experienced the fastest salary growth this year View Gallery\n\nWith the business sponsoring her and the help of a professional migration lawyer, Fraser applied for and was granted a TSS visa in September 2023.\n\nShe moved from Ballarat to Sydney and started work two weeks later.\n\n\ufeffTo be eligible for a TRT visa and permanent residency, Fraser would have to work \ufefffor the same employer for two full years.\n\nShe knew her existing TSS visa would expire two weeks shy of that milestone but there was no \ufefflimit on how many times she could apply for a TSS visa while in Australia, so Fraser simply planned to apply for a second TSS visa to cover the extra time.\n\nThat plan went up in flames this year.\n\nCaitlin Fraser will miss out on meeting the full time employment requirements to apply for permanent residency by two weeks. (Supplied)\n\nIn May, Fraser received a devastating call from her migration agent.\ufeff\n\nThey explained that changes to Australia's visas \ufeffmeant Fraser was no longer allowed to renew her visa, nor would she be eligible to apply for a TRT visa by the time it expired.\n\nSuddenly, she was facing the very real possibility of deportation.\ufeff\n\nIn December 2024, the TSS visa was replaced by the Skills in Demand (SID) visa.\n\nPeople who had already been granted TSS visas would be allowed to stay in Australia until the visa's expiry date but they would not be allowed to renew.\n\nSome could apply for SID visas \u2013 but not Fraser, as restaurant manager is not on the list of eligible occupations.\n\n\u201cWhilst the occupation of Caf\u00e9 or Restaurant Manager was previously available for nomination for a Temporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa, the occupation has not been included on the Core Skills Occupation List (CSOL) and is therefore ineligible for nomination for a SID visa,\u201d a Department of Home Affairs spokesperson told 9news.\n\nIt means she will have to leave the country when her current visa expires, just two weeks shy of completing the two years of fulltime work required to apply for a TRT visa.\n\nOf the employment requirements for a TRT visa, the Department spokesperson said \u201capplicants are required to demonstrate they have worked in eligible sponsored employment for at least two out of the last three years while holding a 457 [Temporary Work (Skilled) visa] or 482 [formerly TSS, now SID] visa\u201d.\n\nFraser is frustrated that changes made to the TSS visa long after she was approved have now made her ineligible for permanent residency.\n\n\"The injustice is insane,\" she said.\n\n\"This should be for new people applying, not for someone who's at the end of the visa. This isn't what I paid for.\"\n\nScottish expat Caitlin Fraser has already spent tens of thousands of dollars on visas to live and work in Australia. (Supplied)\n\nFraser paid $14,000 to secure her existing visa\ufeff with the help of an immigration lawyer.\n\nShe's now working with them in the hopes of finding a solution that will allow her to legally work \ufeffin Australia for the extra two weeks she need to be eligible for a TRT visa.\n\nIf and when she is able to apply for that visa, she will be granted a bridging visa that will cover her \ufeffwhile it is processed.\n\nBut Fraser fears she won't make it that far.\n\n\ufeffEven if she finds a way to legally work the extra two weeks, she may not be able to afford to apply for permanent residency.\n\nApplying for a TRT visa costs upwards of $4900 and Fraser has been quoted $9000 in additional fees from her immigration lawyer.\n\nShe's still paying off the $14,000 from her TSS visa and had hoped that renewing it would give her more time to save money for the TRT application.\ufeff\n\n\"I live week to week, I'm on the minimum that they can give me, and I live in Sydney which is the most expensive city in the world,\" she said.\n\nThe suburbs Australia's richest people call home View Gallery\n\nApplying without the assistance of an immigration lawyer to save money isn't an option either.\n\n\"It's impossible for me alone to do the application in eight weeks. It's a massive process, even the migration officers are going to find it hard to do it in that time,\" Fraser said.\n\nFraser's family have started an online crowdfunding campaign \ufeffto help cover the costs.\n\nIf she's unable to secure or pay for a new visa before her TSS visa expires, she'll be forced to leave Australia on September 14.\n\nWith no savings and no family back in Scotland, Fraser doesn't know where she'll go if that comes to pass.\n\nShe fears she won't be the only one forced out of the country due to changes to the old TSS visa.\ufeff",

        "text": "Nathan Lyon is left out of Australia's Test XI for the first time since 2013 as West Indies wicketkeeper Shai Hope takes a stunning catch.\n\nHere are the quick hits from the day-night Test in Jamaica.\n\n1. Side-Lyoned\n\nLyon was a suprise omission from Australia's XI for the pink ball Test. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nNathan Lyon was dropped on two tours in 2013 \u2014 in India and England \u2014 but since then the off-spinner has been one of the first names on the Australian team sheet as he has climbed to seventh among all Test wicket-takers.\n\nHe is sitting on 562, third among Australians and one behind Glenn McGrath, but will have to wait until this summer's Ashes to try to claim second place after he was left out of the team for the third Test in Jamaica.\n\nPat Cummins and selectors opted for an all-pace attack with the pink ball under lights at Sabina Park, with Scott Boland coming in for his first Test since January.\n\nA calf injury sidelined him for three games in 2023, but this marked the first time in 12 years that a fully fit Lyon missed a Test since that 2013 Ashes series in England.\n\n2. Konstas gets two lives in two balls\n\nSam Konstas and Usman Khawaja looked pretty scratchy in the opening overs in Kingston.\n\nThat almost came to a head in the fifth over when Konstas clipped to square leg and took off for a single, only for Khawaja to rightly send him back.\n\nAustralia's first taste of away day-night Test cricket \u2014 as it happened Photo shows A cricket batter looks down while a bowler runs in celebration. Boasting a formidable 12-1 record in pink-ball Tests on home soil, Australia gets its first look under lights abroad, taking on the West Indies in their final Test in Jamaica.\n\nBut Konstas was already committed and could only watch as John Campbell ran around, gathered the ball and threw at the striker's stumps, just missing.\n\nNot content with being gifted a second life, Konstas then asked for and received a third when he drove at a ball outside off and got a thick edge into the slips cordon.\n\nIt flew in between debutant Kevlon Anderson and Justin Greaves, with the rookie diving and sticking his left hand out at third slip. The ball bounced out and actually hit Greaves at second slip, but it couldn't be reined in.\n\nIt was the 10th dropped catch for the West Indies in the series.\n\n3. Green reviews in the nick of time\n\nJayden Seales's appeal was affirmed, but Cameron Green's review saved him. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nIt was a first session of grit from the Australians, who were much more focused on preservation than run-scoring.\n\nBoth in desperate need of scores, Konstas and Khawaja poked and prodded, played and missed to score just 21 in the opening hour.\n\nNot long after drinks, Konstas was caught plumb in front to Justin Greaves's very first delivery of the match.\n\nIt always looked out, but after consultation with his opening partner, he decided to send it upstairs.\n\nSure enough, three reds meant Australia had burnt a review and that might have been playing on Cam Green's mind only a matter of overs later.\n\nGiven out to one that looked much more likely to be overturned, Green waited until the very last second to ask the third umpire to have a look at it.\n\nThankfully for Green, the technology projected the delivery to be sliding down leg and the big number three was handed a life.\n\n4. Shai gives Hope with stunner\n\nKhawaja had his fair share of luck in his painstaking innings of 23 from 92 deliveries.\n\nHe gritted his teeth and stood his ground through a colourful catalogue of plays and misses, and when he finally did get an edge on an angling Shamar Joseph special, he looked destined to survive that as well.\n\nWith the ball flying towards that uncomfortable gap between wicket-keeper and first slip, West Indies WK Shai Hope made the executive decision to fling himself forward, left and to the ball.\n\nFully outstretched, Hope managed to get his weaker glove underneath the fast-falling pink Dukes and Khawaja's uncomfortable vigil was over before sundown on day one.\n\n5. Anyone got the time?\n\nSteve Smith looked unsettled under the lights after dinner. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nSabina Park received an upgrade in order to host a day-nighter, but there wasn't much time to test all the various bits and pieces involved before the third Test.\n\nSteve Smith, the ultimate problem solver and finder, discovered a quirk of the ground as the lights took effect straight after dinner.\n\nAs he took his guard against Shamar Joseph, Smith took issue with something behind the bowler's arm, which is nothing new for him. But this time it wasn't an inattentive fan, rather an issue with the big analog clock.\n\nOne of the floodlights was causing a reflection or some glare off the clock face and distracting the Australian star.\n\nEventually, a match official, with some help from an Australian team staff member, found a massive black towel to cover up the offending timepiece and the game could finally resume.",

( )\n\nThe South Australian government is providing freight subsidies for charities donating hay, plus grants to upgrade farm infrastructure, including water, grain or fodder storage.\n\nThere are similar infrastructure grants in Victoria, along with rate relief and household support payments.\n\nIn a statement, NSW Agriculture Minister Tara Moriarty said flexible, low-interest loans of up to $250,000 were available to help farmers strengthen drought preparedness.\n\n\"The government is continually monitoring the situation in southern NSW to ensure the needed assistance is being offered,\" she said.\n\nMs Moriarty said $149 million in loans had been provided through the drought infrastructure fund and \"drought-ready and resilient\" fund.",

As Prime Minister Anthony Albanese heads north to China for a week-long visit, Australia's defence force says it is watching for Chinese spy vessels off the Queensland and NT coastlines.\n\nThose figures, prepared in consultation with Treasury and Defence, can be extended to suggest the even larger cost of a 3.5 per cent spend of $45.2 over five years or $287.1 billion over a decade.\n\nThe government currently intends to increase defence spending to 2.3 per cent of GDP by 2035.\n\nTo get to 3.5 per cent instead, the extra funding alone would triple Australia's entire foreign aid budget by the year 2029-30.\n\nMr Conroy told the ABC the government would seek to emphasise that its aid and diplomatic spending, especially in the Pacific region, was also contributing to security.\n\n\"We're making the point to everyone that both [defence and aid spending] are incredibly important,\" he said.\n\n\"We're investing in our relationships in the region, as well as our military capability and we are increasing our defence budget significantly, $57 billion above the previous trajectory,\" he said.\n\n\"We've made it clear that if a case is made for more capability, we'll increase more. We're not going to pluck a figure out of the air and work out how to spend it. That's what the Coalition took to the election.\"\n\nMr Conroy, who is acting for Richard Marles in the defence portfolio but whose regular portfolio is defence industry, said Australia was also trying to get more value for money from defence procurement processes.\n\n\"It's a challenging area for every country around the world [and] it was problematic under the last government \u2026 We've made significant reforms to how we do defence procurement,\" he said.\n\n\"It is important that taxpayers have confidence that every single dollar goes to improving capability of the Australian Defence Force as well as supporting the 100,000 Australians who work in that industry.\"\n\n'Sovereignty' central amid reports of Taiwan request\n\nMr Conroy said Australia would not \"engage in hypotheticals\" after a report in the Financial Times that Mr Colby was also pressing both Australia and Japan to give assurances about how they would respond in the event of a war with China over Taiwan.\n\nIn a social media post following that report, Mr Colby did not address Taiwan directly but said the Pentagon had \"made abundantly and consistently clear\" it wanted allies to \"step up their defense spending and other efforts related to our collective defense.\n\n\"This has been a hallmark of President Trump's strategy in Asia as in Europe where it has already been tremendously successful,\" he said, describing the pressure on NATO allies to spend more as a \"formula\" for other regions.\n\n\"Of course, some among our allies might not welcome frank conversations. But many... are seeing the urgent need to step up and are doing so.\"\n\nMr Conroy told the ABC Australia would make its own decisions about any conflict.\n\nMarles downplays Trump review of AUKUS Photo shows two man are standing in front of a US flag and an Australian flag Australia's defence minister insists he is not concerned about the country's prospects of acquiring nuclear-powered submarines, despite the US government announcing a review of the security pact.\n\n\"The sole power to commit Australia to war or to allow our territory to be used for a conflict is the elected government of the day,\" he said.\n\n\"Sovereignty will always be prioritised and that will continue to be our position.\"\n\nOfficials have also emphasised Australia's strategic focus on deterrence and opposition to the use of force.\n\n\"We are being very clear that we want a balanced region where no-one is dominated and no-one dominates,\" he said.",

        "text": "Exotic Asian mushrooms are now being grown using a by-product from sugarcane processing.\n\nBagasse, the material left over after sugarcane has been processed, has proven to be a viable and productive growing substrate for Asian mushrooms.\n\n\"One [bagasse] bag, we can produce about 200 to 250 grams [of mushrooms],\" exotic mushroom grower Simon Tang said.\n\n\"That's quite a good result in this industry.\"\n\nMr Tang grows premium Asian mushrooms across two farms at Park Ridge in Logan in south-east Queensland.\n\n\"We probably produce from 2 to 3 tonnes every week, including king, oyster mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms,\" he said.\n\nThe pandemic compromised output for Mr Tang's company Kenon Mushrooms, with import interruptions and delays.\n\nPandemic disruption sparks rethink\n\nThe Asian mushroom spores and their growing substrate were imported from China.\n\n\"Normally the shipping container comes here [after] like 21 days, [but during the pandemic] maybe they take up to two months to come,\" Mr Tang said.\n\n\" A lot of factories [in China] they stop, so they can't supply to you. \"\n\nSimon Tang was a computer engineer before he became a mushroom grower. (ABC Landline: Courtney Wilson)\n\nWhen imports were cancelled or delayed, production for Mr Tang's company ground to a halt.\n\n\"After that I [began] thinking maybe I need to think about [the company switching to] grow everything locally in Australia [because it] can protect your business [when it's] at risk,\" Mr Tang said.\n\nPrevious attempts to use locally sourced sawdust or cottonseed husk as mushroom substrates had failed due to difficulty sourcing and maintaining a consistent supply.\n\nWhen Mr Tang discovered research to use sugarcane bagasse to grow Asian mushrooms, he was intrigued.\n\n\"I said, 'Whoa, that's quite a good idea' because in Queensland we got a lot of sugar on the farms,\" he said.\n\n\" [It's] easy for us to get these sugarcane bagasse so that's why I'm thinking we can try. \"\n\nThe company produces 2 to 3 tonnes of mushrooms each week, including king oyster and shiitake varieties. (ABC Landline: Courtney Wilson)\n\nSince then, the Millaquin mill in Bundaberg has supplied Mr Tang's company with bagasse to grow exotic mushrooms.\n\nMill manager Lincoln Williams said the collaboration came about after Mr Tang contacted him directly.\n\n\"He sent me an email saying, 'Yeah this is what I'm looking at doing, growing mushrooms from bagasse \u2026 are you interested in supplying some?'\n\n\"So we went, 'Yep \u2014 no worries.' We had some spare,\" Mr Williams said.\n\nLincoln Williams's sugar mill supplies leftover sugarcane bagasse to grower Simon Tang. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nWhat is bagasse and why use it?\n\nAll sugar mills run differently, but at the Millaquin mill bagasse is stockpiled on site and on a nearby farm too.\n\n\"Bagasse is the by-product after we squeeze out all the sugar juice out of it [the sugarcane],\" Mr Williams said.\n\nThe fibrous sugarcane waste bagasse is crushed and repurposed as a growing medium for exotic mushrooms. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\" It's about 45 per cent moisture, and we use that in our boilers to produce the steam, which runs the whole process. \"\n\nThe mill is seasonal, coinciding with sugarcane harvesting, which generally starts during winter.\n\nBut even when it's not crushing season, the bagasse is still necessary for the year-long sugar refinery operation.\n\n\"We use every part of it that we can,\" Mr Williams said.\n\n\" In the non-crush [season] we burn it. We reuse it [bagasse] so we can supply steam to the refinery. \"\n\nThis wasn't always the case, but efforts to make sugar production more efficient over the years have prompted changes in the industry.\n\n\"It saves us using coal later on. We don't want to use coal, so we use bagasse and some woodchip as well,\" Mr Williams said.\n\n\"If we have any excess stuff that we don't use that year we do sell it to some other companies that use it in mulch and things like that.\"\n\nUsing sugarcane bagasse to grow mushrooms is definitely outside of the ordinary.\n\nExotic Asian mushrooms are grown inside tunnels at the farm at Park Ridge. (ABC Landline: Courtney Wilson)\n\nCQ University researchers have led trials at Mr Tang's manufacturing facility, cultivating mushroom spores and developing different recipes using bagasse.\n\nThey've also mixed in other waste products, including peanut shells.\n\n\"It's definitely exciting,\" CQ University professor Delwar Akbar said.\n\n\"We are trying to understand what is the development impact of such an industry where the raw materials are close by, and how the supply chain will work in this area,\" Mr Akbar said.\n\nDelwar Akbar has led trials into using sugarcane bagasse and peanut shells to grow exotic mushrooms. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nGrowing mushrooms by the bag\n\nOnce the substrate bags are composed, they're injected with the mushrooms' spores before being stored in incubation rooms.\n\nMr Tang's bagasse bag manufacturing facility in Bundaberg, Queensland is currently producing up to 10,000 substrate bags a week.\n\nSimon Tang and Stephen Newbould inside the incubation room at their Bundaberg facility. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"We've got the only bagging machine in Australia that produces bags without hand packing,\" factory manager Stephen Newbould said.\n\n\" We can produce 10,000 bags or we can produce 20,000 bags if needed. No-one else can do that. \"\n\nMr Tang sells his exotic mushrooms at major markets in Brisbane and Sydney as well as to other local markets, Asian grocers and specialty restaurants.\n\nKenon Mushrooms has packed thousands of bagasse substrate grow bags for growing exotic mushrooms. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nBut his hope is to supply bagasse grow bags to more people, to increase the number of mushroom growers.\n\n\"They can get mushroom bags from our factory, and then they can produce it in [their] local backyard to grow mushrooms. [It's] very easy,\" Mr Tang said.\n\nThe more growers he can support, Mr Tang believes, the better the Australian industry will become.\n\n\"I'm [hoping to] changing Australian people's [preferences] from the button mushroom to more varieties of mushroom,\" he said.\n\n\"You know, one thing is we give more people more choices, like a more healthy, more nutritious food choice.\"\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm AEST on Sunday or stream anytime on ABC iview.",

But a long-awaited state of the environment report paints a different picture.\n\nThis included a worsening situation for threatened flora and fauna, the increasing fragmentation of native vegetation, the spread of invasive weeds and animals, and a lack of reliable data for water quality.\n\nThe report made 16 recommendations, the Liberal government accepted six in full.\n\nAt last year's state election, the Liberals' environment promises \u2014 under the title \"keeping our parks and environment strong\" \u2014 listed a range of funding for visitor infrastructure in state and national parks.\n\nAn oil spill at Lake Rosebery in January.

That sends a very clear message to the world of our environmental credentials.\"\n\nA significant proportion of that \"reserve\" land is the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.\n\nMr Rockliff also listed the state's new container deposit scheme as a positive environmental outcome.\n\nSewage flows into the River Derwent without being fully treated.

As Tasmanians prepare for a July 19 vote, we keep track of each party's election promises on everything from health and housing, to the stadium.\n\nBut the Tasmanian Greens say this intent has not been achieved, because the EPA still has a \"statement of expectation\" from the environment minister.\n\nThis includes that the EPA will \"support sustainable development in Tasmania\", which the Act defines as \"the use, development and protection of natural and physical resources\".\n\nThe term, to \"protect the environment of Tasmania\", was removed from the Act in 2008 and has not returned.\n\nGreens leader Rosalie Woodruff said both major parties were sidelining environmental protection.\n\n\"The Liberals have promised to do nothing.

(ABC Rural: Luke Radford )\n\nLandcare Tasmania chief executive officer Peter Stronach told the forum that volunteer groups were under increasing pressure due to the ongoing spread of invasive weeds.\n\nHe said they remained heavily reliant on fundraising but government support was sporadic.\n\n\"We don't get the funding that we need, and when the funding does come it's quite haphazard, to say the least,\" he said.\n\n\" We can't keep doing this for nothing. \"",

        "text": "The August 1 deadline gives targeted countries time to negotiate agreements that could lower the threatened tariffs. Some investors and economists have also noted Trump\u2019s pattern of backing off his tariff threats. The spate of letters showed Trump has returned to the aggressive trade posture that he took in April when he announced a slew of reciprocal tariffs against trading partners that sent markets tumbling before the White House delayed implementation. \u2018Unfair treatment\u2019 But with the stock market recently hitting record highs and the US economy still resilient, Trump is showing no signs of slowing down his trade war.\n\nHe promised to use the 90-day delay in April to strike dozens of new trade deals, but has secured framework agreements only with Britain, China and Vietnam. The EU has hoped to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the US for the 27-country bloc. Trump\u2019s letter to the EU included a demand that Europe drop its own tariffs. Loading \u201cThe European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large Trade Deficit,\u201d he wrote. Von der Leyen said the 30 per cent tariffs \u201cwould disrupt essential trans-Atlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic\u201d.\n\nShe also said while the EU would continue to work towards a trade agreement, it \u201cwill take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required\u201d. Mexico\u2019s economy ministry said Saturday it was informed the US would send a letter during a meeting on Friday with US officials. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she was sure an agreement could be reached. Credit: nna\\KCampbell \u201cWe mentioned at the roundtable that it was unfair treatment and that we did not agree,\u201d the ministry\u2019s statement said. Rate for Mexico lower than Canada\n\nMexico\u2019s proposed tariff level is lower than Canada\u2019s 35 per cent, with both letters citing fentanyl flows even though government data shows the amount of the drug seized at the Mexican border is significantly higher than the Canadian border. \u201cMexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough. Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\u201d Trump wrote. China is the main source of the chemicals used to make the opioid fentanyl. According to US authorities, only 0.2 per cent of all fentanyl seized in the US comes from across the Canadian\n\nborder, while the vast majority originates from the US-Mexico border. Mexico sends more than 80 per cent of its total exported goods to the US and free trade with its northern neighbour drove Mexico to become the top US trading partner in 2023. The EU had initially hoped to strike a comprehensive trade agreement but more recently had scaled back its ambitions and shifted toward securing a broader framework deal similar to the one Britain brokered that leaves details to be negotiated.\n\nThe bloc is under conflicting pressures as powerhouse Germany urged a quick deal to safeguard its industry, while other EU members, such as France, have said EU negotiators should not cave into a one-sided deal on US terms. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it \u201cwill take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests\u201d. Credit: AP Bernd Lange, head of the European Parliament\u2019s trade committee, said Brussels should enact countermeasures as soon as Monday. \u201cThis is a slap in the face for the negotiations. This is no way to deal with a key trading partner,\u201d Lange told Reuters. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said Trump\u2019s letter raised the risk of retaliatory moves by the EU similar to the flare-up between the US and China that rattled financial markets. \u201cUS and Chinese tariffs went up together and they came back down again. Not all the way down, but still down together,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the weekday lunch rush and diners at 'Kitchen by Mike' - a popular restaurant in the Sydney CBD are among the first in the country to try a curious new cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcclaimed chef Mike McEnearney's much-loved sourdough bread is now being served with what's known as 'cultured Japanese quail spread.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the cultured quail is folded through the butter. I would describe it as incredibly strong and mammy flavor with a texture of butter. So if you like strong chickeny quail flavors, it's in the texture of butter on bread., it's delicious, it's almost like p\u00e2t\u00e9.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what makes it so unique?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the quail meat in the butter did not come from a farm, rather it was produced in factory in the inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria - about a 20 minute drive from the restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Cultured meat' is the process of taking a small amount of cells from an animal - in this case, a quail - and growing them in a factory-like setting to eventually produce a type of meat product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My first time in 35 years of cooking that I've seen a new category come to market. It's really exciting. It is brand new food.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the verdict from diners?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiner 1: \"Yeah I'd say it's pretty adventurous, Mike was mentioning it's pretty revolutionary. It's quite new in the industry so I'm glad to have tried it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDiner 2: \"P\u00e2t\u00e9, like a smokey p\u00e2t\u00e9. Really unusual taste but quite nice, I'd definitely have it again. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nDiner 3: \"I really like the innovative nature of it and I think I'd be really happy to see it more on menus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom hatted restaurants to pubs, around a dozen restaurants across Australia have this week begun serving the cultured quail. About a dozen more will have it on their menu by the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product is the brainchild of Australian start-up Vow, which in June became the first company in the country to be given the greenlight to sell cultured meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows a more than two year approval process by the food safety regulator, F-S-A-N-Z.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen DInsmoor, Vow's Chief Operating Officer, insists the company is not trying to replace meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what we make is very unique in that it's not plant-based, we're not trying to recreate beef and other meats we eat today. We're taking different cells from other animals, growing those and then using them to make new food products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the quail cells are grown in a bioreactor, which is essentially a large stainless steel tank, similar to what you might see in a brewery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We take actual cells from animals and we grow them in what I think of as a nutrient broth, which is essentially recreating the conditions in which cells grow in our body or in an animal's body that has amino acids, salts, sugars. At the end of the day, you can harvest those cells out. Maybe imagine that if you're making cheese and you are taking some of the whey off the top, that's kind of what it looks like when you harvest the cells out. And then we can take those cells as a really beautiful, pure ingredient, really rich form of protein, another nutrient, some craft those into finished food products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the product only made its debut in Australia this month, for the past year, it's been available in Singapore - the first country globally to approve the sale of cultured meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why produce food this way? Paul Wood, a Professor in Biotechnology at Monash University explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, for some people it's because they don't want to see animals harmed. For others, it's an environmental thing. They believe that this is going to be a more sustainable way of producing food. Some just say it's a new food experience. So there's a range of ways that it's being sort of marketed to people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says, until the industry scales at large it remains unclear whether it will be more sustainable than farming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will use less land. It's a factory. It'll probably use less water. But we know already that on an energy basis, it's unlikely to be more sustainable because it's quite an energy intensive process. So you really need to be using totally renewable energy. And even then, if you compared it to growing an animal in a paddock, it's still a hell of a lot more intensive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says cost is another challenge, and when it comes to nutrition:\n\n\n\n\"It's unlikely, I think, to be better than a piece of meat, a three dimensional with a lot of iron in there, a lot of vitamins, B12, et cetera. So we talk about meat being an energy dense or a nutritionally dense product, you're going to have to add back minerals and vitamins to this product. There's only one single cell type.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut others believe the industry has a role to play in addressing future food challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy some estimates, agricultural production will need to increase by around 60 percent by 2050 to meet the demands of the growing population.\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Perkins is the CEO of Cellular Agriculture Australia, a not-for-profit that seeks to advance cellular agriculture, which is the process of using cells to create products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see cellular agriculture and the technologies that sit within it as a way of complimenting existing food supply chains and move towards a more future-proof food system where the technologies offer the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land use and reduce water use, whilst also building resilience, particularly around things like climate shocks or supply chain disruptions and emerging threats like zoonotic diseases as we've seen recently through avian flu.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is currently being harnessed to make everything from coffee to palm oil, leather and chocolate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut scaling the industry remains a challenge and calls for better investment come as countries take steps to ban sale and consumption of cultured food, Italy, France and some US states among them.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns over quality and the threat to farmers are among the issues driving the pushback.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian farm lobby has labelled it \u2018Frankenstein meat.'\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins says misconceptions around the concept of cultured meat are feeding 'unhelpful narratives.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing we hear a lot is references to things like lab-grown meat. Cell ag products aren't produced in labs, even if the original technology was developed by scientists. They're made in food manufacturing facilities that look far more like breweries than they do a science lab.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Antidepressants are some of the most commonly prescribed medications globally and in Australia, but knowledge of how they work and how hard it is to come off them remains highly contested.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows nearly four million Australians \u2014 roughly one in seven \u2014 take antidepressants.\n\n\n\n\n\nA large systematic review of research into the process of withdrawing from the drugs was published this week, but it quickly faced backlash from some psychiatrists and experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors found coming off antidepressants after short-term use was not associated with a \"clinically significant\" risk of withdrawal symptoms. However, long-term antidepressant use \u2014 that is longer than 12 months \u2014 is increasingly common and comes with a greater risk of harm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review found withdrawal symptoms \u2014 such as dizziness, nausea, vertigo \u2014 occur in a minority of cases, but they are on average manageable and not severe, especially with proper clinical support.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors suggest that depression after stopping antidepressants is probably a relapse of the original mental health condition, as the results were similar among placebo groups.\n\n\n\nThe meta-analysis examined the findings of 50 randomised controlled trials, involving 17,828 participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review published in JAMA Psychiatry included 38 studies with an observation period longer than two weeks, the critical time frame during which withdrawal symptoms are expected to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average age of the participants was 44, and 70 per cent were female. In Australia, women are prescribed antidepressants at 1.5 times the rate of men \u2014 a trend that's seen in other parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome health professionals say the review provides useful insights, despite its limitations, while others have been highly critical.\n\n\n\n\n\nUK antidepressant researchers Mark Horowitz and Julie Moncrieff said the review \"risks underestimating the potential harms to long-term antidepressant users by focusing on short-term, industry-funded studies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of the JAMA Psychiatry article's senior authors declared receiving payments from drug companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorowitz and Moncrieff argue that the article's \"main analysis\" is based on eleven trials, six of which looked at people who had taken antidepressants for eight weeks and four for 12 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is growing recognition that stopping antidepressants \u2014 especially after long-term use \u2014 can cause severe and sometimes debilitating withdrawal symptoms, and it is now acknowledged by the UK government as a public health issue,\" they wrote in The Conversation.\n\n\n\nNew resources have been developed to support people safely stopping the use of antidepressants over time usually months, through what's called a tapering plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Maudsley Deprescribing Guidelines, published last year and co-authored by Horowitz, has been accepted by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners as an Accepted Clinical Resource.\n\n\n\nOn again, off again antidepressant prescriptions\n\nAllied health professional Kizzy said she never wanted to be reliant on anti-depressants and has stopped taking them twice in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was initially quite resistant to any kind of medication, but I got to a point a couple of years ago ... where I was really struggling with suicidal thoughts and just being able to function and do things because of my mood, and all of these horrible feelings and thoughts I was having, and finally got convinced to try sertraline\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she noticed the drug \u2014 a commonly prescribed antidepressant sometimes sold under the name Zoloft \u2014 was making her feel \"numb\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My hope is that I can one day be not require antidepressants and still maintain this level of functioning and mental health,\" she said adding that her current medication \"potentially affects\" her liver.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States National Library of Medicine says liver abnormalities reportedly occur in around 1 per cent of people who take sertraline, \"but elevations are usually modest and infrequently require dose modification or discontinuation\".\n\n\n\nProfessor Paul Fitzgerald is the director of the School of Medicine and Psychology at Australian National University and a member of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was not involved in the review.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's important to be aware of the more severe cases of side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are some unusual symptoms that patients experience. The most dramatic one the patients find quite disturbing is the phenomena that patients often talk about as brain zaps.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They get this very strange sensation of electrical zaps in their head or down their spinal cord, and if they haven't been warned about it, it can be quite distressing. It just seems strange.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's unclear from this latest review whether the symptoms recorded by researchers are a relapse of a previous mental health condition or withdrawal effects from discontinuing antidepressants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What happens when somebody's stopping a medication and their underlying symptoms of their condition get worse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In other words, start to experience more depression or more anxiety, and it can be really difficult to know under those circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Are those symptoms that they're experiencing some sort of discontinuation or is it really just the symptoms of the illness coming back because the treatment's been withdrawn?\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE When builder Jamie was struggling he broke an unwritten 'code'. It saved his life\n\nSonya Morrissey is the national GP adviser at Headspace, a platform supporting the mental health and wellbeing of younger people.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that, in the past, patients weren't sufficiently warned about discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is something that we are, I think, recognising more and there's lots more research being done now, which is great, although there's not a significant amount of research yet in the cohort that we see, which is the 12 to 25 year olds,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said antidepressants are not their first line of treatment at Headspace, but will be used occasionally if needed.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO What are the withdrawal effects of antidepressants? A new review explores the issue SBS News 11/07/2025 08:17 English\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' Western Australia vice-president, Dr Ramya Raman, said the recently published meta-analysis still provides useful insight for GPs but said more research on withdrawing from long-term anti-depressant use was needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also highlighted the importance of a good doctor-patient relationship when withdrawing from psychiatric medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When weaning off of the medication and there is a trusted relationship with the GP, and a regular follow-up with that doctor, the risk of having the discontinuation symptoms are less of a concern compared to when patients actually abruptly stop it.\n\n\n\n\n\nKizzy also said finding a GP with an interest in mental health can make a big difference when navigating the use of antidepressants and the withdrawal process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's important to find a GP who has a genuine interest in that area rather than just going to your generic GP, finding a regular one who you know can rely on, who can really support you and speak to you in a way that you're going to feel respected and really understood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think that's a really important kind of foundation support to have because once you have that, then you will feel safe enough to be checking in with them, sharing all your concerns, talking about coming off or going on or switching medications and still be okay through all of that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking crisis support can ring Lifeline on 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged up to 25).

Source: SBS News Cultured meat is the process of taking a small number of cells from an animal, in this case, a quail, and growing them in a controlled environment to eventually produce a type of meat product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It's] my first time in 35 years of cooking that I've seen a new category come to market.

About a dozen more will have it on their menu by the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product is the brainchild of Australian start-up Vow, which in June became the first company in the country to receive approval to sell cultured meat.\n\n\n\nIt follows a more than two-year approval process by the food safety regulator, Food Standards Australia New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen Dinsmoor, Vow's CEO, insists the company is not trying to replace meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we make is very unique in that it's not plant-based, we're not trying to recreate beef and other meats we eat today.

Concerns over quality and the threat to farmers are among the issues driving the pushback.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian farm lobby has previously labelled cultured meat \"Frankenstein meat\".\n\n\n\nPerkins said misconceptions are feeding \"unhelpful narratives\" about the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing we hear a lot is references to things like lab-grown meat. Cell ag products aren't produced in labs, even if the original technology was developed by scientists. They're made in food manufacturing facilities that look far more like breweries than they do a science lab,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the industry has a long way to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nVow is one of only three companies globally approved to sell cultured meat.

        "text": "More than a million pieces of ancient rock art have secured World Heritage status in a bittersweet listing for environmentalists and traditional custodians fearful nearby industrial activity is damaging the engravings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Murujuga rock art landscape in Western Australia was listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as a heritage site on Friday after intense lobbying by the federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For more than 50,000 years, the Ngarda-Ngarli people have protected and managed this significant land and seascape \u2014 and today, I am proud to announce that Murujuga will receive another level of protection via the World Heritage system,\" Environment Minister Murray Watt said while visiting the organisation's headquarters in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Achieving World Heritage status ensures stronger protections under Australian legislation and will allow the world to celebrate this unique cultural landscape,\" the minister added.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt, who was accompanied on his trip by representatives from the Western Australian government and Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, said the World Heritage nomination \"had the free, prior and informed consent of the five language groups who all come together to care for Murujuga today\".\n\n\n\nMurujuga Aboriginal Corporation director Peter Hicks said the nomination \"was led by Aboriginal people, for Aboriginal people and guided by Aboriginal people. And therefore, it is world-first.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother director, Belinda Churnside, said the listing \"was a testament to the true dedication, commitment and resilience of Aboriginal people\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMurujuga contains the world's largest, densest and most diverse collection of rock art engravings \u2014 known as petroglyphs \u2014 and some are estimated to be more than 50,000 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey depict animals, plants and human figures, and are visible due to the colour and contrast between the removed varnish layer and the underlying brighter weathered rind of the host rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site, which has been called the oldest art gallery in the world , was previously put forward to UNESCO in 2023 but Australia's application was referred back in May.\n\n\n\nWoodside's North West Shelf gas processing plan sits alongside the Murujuga Cultural Landscape in Burrup Peninsula, Western Australia. Source: Supplied / Save Our Songlines / Conservation Council of Western Australia UNESCO recommended state and federal governments address concerns that nearby acid emissions, including those from Woodside's Burrup gas hub, were degrading the art.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peninsula in northwest WA near Karratha is home to two gas plants, a fertiliser plant and iron ore and salt export facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt recently gave provisional approval for a Woodside project on the peninsula to continue operating until 2070.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking after UNESCO's announcement today, Watt said: \"In the end, what persuaded the committee was both the scientific evidence that was put forward, which disputed some of the claims that were being made, but also the genuine passion from the Traditional Owners to see this World Heritage listing be secured.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 21 UNESCO member nations voted unanimously in support of the listing but requested that Australia continue to research and monitor the effects of industry on the rock art.\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalists, Traditional Custodians vow to continue fight\n\nWhile environmentalists welcomed the heritage listing, they warned that the Woodside project extension could cause further damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The world is now watching,\" Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The onus is on the Australian government to make sure the values recognised by UNESCO are not jeopardised by ongoing industrial pollution. If the federal government is serious about protecting Murujuga and making sure it is not moved to an \"in danger\" list, Senator Watt should reject the gas hub's proposed expansion,\" O'Shanassy added.\n\n\n\n\n\nMardathoonera woman and Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper, who was at the UNESCO meeting, welcomed the World Heritage listing but criticised the removal of recommended protections, including halting industry expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today, Australia rewrote the World Heritage listing in the interests of the gas industry,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, she said it was \"a momentous day for our old people and our future generations, to have Murujuga's outstanding universal heritage values recognised by the world\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Surface tension: Murujuga World Heritage listing at risk from industrial emissions\n\n\"Meanwhile, fertiliser plants are still being built around our sacred sites and polluting gas plants will emit toxic acid on our rock art for another 50 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will continue to fight for protection for this very special place, and the world is now aware of what we are up against.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWoodside said the listing was \"well-deserved global recognition of the petroglyphs and the unique living cultural values of Murujuga\" to Australia and the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Woodside has been a proud supporter of the World Heritage nomination and assessment process. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and Traditional Custodians on the continued protection and management of this globally significant area,\" the company said in a statement sent to SBS News.\n\n\n\nMardathoonera woman Raelene Cooper, a former Chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, has previously said she was \"sickened\" by Environment Minister Murray Watt's decision to grant Woodside a 40-year extension to its North West Shelf project. Source: Supplied / Raelene Cooper Greens Leader Larissa Waters joined the chorus of advocate voices in urging Senator Watt to cancel the approval for the North West Shelf project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"UNESCO had warned that Woodside's gas plant threatened the longevity of the rock art prior to the listing, but Minister Watt successfully lobbied other nations when he should have simply rejected Woodside's climate bomb extension in the first place,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoodside has estimated that keeping the North-West Shelf operating until 2070 could lead to emissions of up to 4.3 billion tons tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e), the majority of which will come from exported fossil fuel products.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's over nine times Australia's total annual emissions, which currently sit around 440.2 million tonnes CO 2 -e.\n\n\n\nSenator Waters added that world heritage laws should be bolstered to better protect listed sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has 21 properties on the World Heritage list, which includes the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNESCO added several other sites to its list, including the Xixia Imperial Tombs in China and the Faya Palaeolandscape in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n",

On Thursday a hot-air balloon flew over the peloton with his face on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All you could hear was 'Kevin, Kevin' all along the road, it's so good to have a new face competing with us,\" said Pogacar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overnight leader Mathieu van der Poel rounds out the top five at 1min 29sec after wilting on the final climb, the scene of his 2021 coming of age win and his first yellow jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I kind of knew I was going to lose the yellow jersey here, but it was a special occasion for me coming back here. It was a great day,\" said the Dutch rider who climbed top of the overall rankings Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day's action revolved around two ascents of the Mur de Bretagne, a 2km climb at an average of six percent, that has been written into Tour de France folklore.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Tour returning to Brittany after a four-year gap, huge festive crowds packed the villages and pretty country lanes as the temperature hit 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 179 remaining riders left Saint Malo on the north-west coast passing the magnificent Sillon beach with its granite sea wall and chic seafront buildings.\n\n\n\nInjured Almeida rides on\n\nKey Pogacar teammate Joao Almeida fell ahead of the second climb of the Mur de Bretagne, but despite sustaining a rib fracture he is due to make the start line for Saturday's flat run to Laval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really hope he's okay, he's on his way for an x-ray. I'm proud of how he's been riding. He's done an amazing job. It would have been a perfect day,\" Pogacar said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I dedicate this victory to him,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater UAE's team doctor Adrian Rotunno reported: \"It's confirmed he has an uncomplicated left-sided rib fracture, as well as some profound abrasions to his body.

        "text": "A push to export hermit crabs from Western Australia has sparked criticism, with one political party calling to ban the trade over concerns about animal welfare and environmental impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nMerv Cooper runs Crazy Crabs in Western Australia \u2014 a business operating since 1979, specialising in the sale of Australian land hermit crabs. He sells these to Australian pet stories, and also exports them internationally to locations including Hong Kong and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his export permit expired late last year and the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) is now assessing a three-year extension \u2014 a move the Animal Justice Party says would be \"reckless and short-sighted\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News attempted to contact Cooper for comment but he was unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say it's difficult to know whether harvesting the crustaceans is sustainable, due to regulatory gaps in Australia's hermit crab trade.\n\n\n\nA little-known industry\n\nThe species \u2014 Coenobita variabilis \u2014 is endemic to Australia, found only along the north-western coast of Western Australia and in parts of the Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its proposal to the DCCEEW, Crazy Crabs said the business collects on average 30,000 crabs each. In summer, he and a small crew head out for four to six days at a time, collecting crabs at night on foot using torches and buckets. \"Really small\" crabs are left on the beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says collections happen \"only a couple of times a year\" and these don't \"appear to have any detriment on populations\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut reliable data on hermit crab harvesting is scarce.\n\n\n\nDuring a typical year, Merv Cooper collects 30,000 crabs from Western Australian beaches \u2014 which he sends off to pet shops across Australia. Source: Getty / Jamie La Australian states and territories are responsible for domestic trade, including licensing requirements. This makes it difficult to determine the exact number of active hermit crab export operators in Australia, the quantity of crabs they collect, and the potential impact of this activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an ABC report in 2022, WA Fisheries data indicated around 80,000 land hermit crabs were collected by two active operators that year. At the time, they estimated the commercial value of a hermit crab licence to be between $1 million and $5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nA DCCEEW spokesperson said the federal government \"strictly regulates commercial trade in wildlife and wildlife products from Australian native species, such as hermit crabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Justice Party MPs say the application highlights a lack of scientific rigour in how such trades are assessed \u2014 and could open the door to further exploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This proposal is a stark example of the federal government's failure to uphold rigorous scientific and environmental standards,\" said Victorian upper house MP Georgie Purcell,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Allowing the commercial export of a native species without comprehensive ecological assessments is reckless and short-sighted.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWA upper house MP Amanda Dorn said she is concerned that if the trade is allowed to continue with little regulation, \"fragile ecosystems\" could be \"irreversibly\" damaged.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its proposal, Crazy Crabs said WA's Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development does not consider Coenobita variabilis to be in need of formal management plans for protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said the number of crabs and the locations where they were collected are reported monthly, as required by state licensing laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have been collecting Hermit crabs for over 50 years and have never seen any need for restrictions,\" the proposal reads.\" I don\u2019t go to all places every year, hence there is always plenty of hermit crabs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Nichols, a manager at WA Fisheries, told the ABC in 2022 the species was abundant and their population was unlikely to be affected by the current level of fishing.\n\n\n\n'Relying on self-reporting': Expert raises concerns\n\nKim Feddema, a wildlife trade expert and lecturer at Edith Cowan University, said the trade relies heavily on licence-holders to assess their own environmental impact, with no baseline population data or independent monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to understand how many hermit crabs are actually in those locations and what role they play in the broader ecology,\" she told SBS News. \"Without baseline data, there's no way to judge the sustainability of this kind of trade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the international export of native species is subject to federal regulation, hermit crabs are not formally listed as protected. Invertebrates often fall through regulatory gaps, Feddema said, because they're harder to monitor and traditionally not perceived as sentient.\n\n\n\nKim Feddema, a wildlife trade expert, said more regulation is necessary in the industry to ensure the welfare of hermit crabs and to understand the environmental implications of their removal. Credit: Stephen Heath / Edith Cowan University Globally, land hermit crabs are harvested for both the pet and shell trade. While shells are often sold as decorations, Feddema notes they once housed live animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People often perceive [shells] to be empty, but there is a live animal within them before that stage,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Asia, including Thailand and Japan, this dual trade has already been linked to population declines. While Australia requires permits to collect hermit crabs at a commercial level, enforcement is limited and operators are not independently monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're relying on self-reporting here,\" Feddema said. \"There's no verification of what's being collected or the long-term impact on local populations.\"\n\n\n\nAre hermit crabs suitable pets?\n\nHermit crabs play a vital role in their native ecosystems, Feddema said, acting as \"ecosystem engineers\". They recycle shells that would otherwise be buried by sand, creating homes for algae, sponges, and other small organisms. They also help with nutrient recycling by scavenging on waste and decaying animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite this ecological importance, hermit crabs are often marketed as low-maintenance pets \u2014 sold in pet stores and online \u2014 a characterisation Feddema said is misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said in the wild, they can live for over thirty years. In captivity, however, their lifespans are often significantly shortened \u2014 sometimes surviving only a few months or years. She compared the industry to the \"cut flower trade\", where high mortality rates are treated as inevitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People sometimes treat pets the same way they treat cut flowers \u2014 that they'll have them for a short period of time and then accept a certain level of mortality,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its proposal, Crazy Crabs said its experience in taking, holding and transporting hermit crabs \"has reduced the mortality rate during transit to practical zero for the last ten years\".\n\n\n\nDemand for rare and large individuals is also growing, raising concerns about overharvesting ecologically important crabs that produce a high number of offspring.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have shown hermit crabs exhibit signs of sentience, including problem solving, memory and a response to pain \u2014 which Feddema said challenges assumptions that invertebrates do not require additional welfare standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a question about how appropriate they are to be held in captivity,\" she said. \"If the owner doesn't have the particular needs and they're not able to recognise the complexity of owning a hermit crab.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said reforms are urgently needed to assess population health and establish long-term data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very possible that this is a trade that is sustainable, but we just can't make that decision without the data behind it.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The August 1 deadline gives targeted countries time to negotiate agreements that could lower the threatened tariffs. Some investors and economists have also noted Trump\u2019s pattern of backing off his tariff threats. The spate of letters showed Trump has returned to the aggressive trade posture that he took in April when he announced a slew of reciprocal tariffs against trading partners that sent markets tumbling before the White House delayed implementation. \u2018Unfair treatment\u2019 But with the stock market recently hitting record highs and the US economy still resilient, Trump is showing no signs of slowing down his trade war.\n\nHe promised to use the 90-day delay in April to strike dozens of new trade deals, but has secured framework agreements only with Britain, China and Vietnam. The EU has hoped to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the US for the 27-country bloc. Trump\u2019s letter to the EU included a demand that Europe drop its own tariffs. Loading \u201cThe European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large Trade Deficit,\u201d he wrote. Von der Leyen said the 30 per cent tariffs \u201cwould disrupt essential trans-Atlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic\u201d.\n\nShe also said while the EU would continue to work towards a trade agreement, it \u201cwill take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required\u201d. Mexico\u2019s economy ministry said Saturday it was informed the US would send a letter during a meeting on Friday with US officials. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she was sure an agreement could be reached. Credit: nna\\KCampbell \u201cWe mentioned at the roundtable that it was unfair treatment and that we did not agree,\u201d the ministry\u2019s statement said. Rate for Mexico lower than Canada\n\nMexico\u2019s proposed tariff level is lower than Canada\u2019s 35 per cent, with both letters citing fentanyl flows even though government data shows the amount of the drug seized at the Mexican border is significantly higher than the Canadian border. \u201cMexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough. Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\u201d Trump wrote. China is the main source of the chemicals used to make the opioid fentanyl. According to US authorities, only 0.2 per cent of all fentanyl seized in the US comes from across the Canadian\n\nborder, while the vast majority originates from the US-Mexico border. Mexico sends more than 80 per cent of its total exported goods to the US and free trade with its northern neighbour drove Mexico to become the top US trading partner in 2023. The EU had initially hoped to strike a comprehensive trade agreement but more recently had scaled back its ambitions and shifted toward securing a broader framework deal similar to the one Britain brokered that leaves details to be negotiated.\n\nThe bloc is under conflicting pressures as powerhouse Germany urged a quick deal to safeguard its industry, while other EU members, such as France, have said EU negotiators should not cave into a one-sided deal on US terms. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it \u201cwill take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests\u201d. Credit: AP Bernd Lange, head of the European Parliament\u2019s trade committee, said Brussels should enact countermeasures as soon as Monday. \u201cThis is a slap in the face for the negotiations. This is no way to deal with a key trading partner,\u201d Lange told Reuters. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said Trump\u2019s letter raised the risk of retaliatory moves by the EU similar to the flare-up between the US and China that rattled financial markets. \u201cUS and Chinese tariffs went up together and they came back down again. Not all the way down, but still down together,\u201d he said.",

Picture: Supplied\n\nAlmost eight months on from the Laos methanol poisoning, one of the survivors is speaking out on how they were failed by the small Southeast Asian nation and how prospective travellers are able to protect themselves from the dangers of bootleg alcohol.\n\nIn November 2024, six people died after drinking alcohol suspected to be contaminated with methanol at the Nana Backpacker Hostel in Vang Vieng Laos. Two of those were 19-year old Australians Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles.\n\nBethany Clarke, from the UK but now living in Brisbane, was one of the lucky survivors of the poisoning; however, childhood best friend Simone White \u2013 whom Ms Clarke was travelling with at the time \u2013 was not so fortunate.\n\nMs White\u2019s mother was faced with the tragic decision to turn off her life support after she suffered irreversible brain damage resulting from the poisoning.\n\nSimone White at the hostel where the poisoning occurred. Picture: Supplied\n\nThe fatal, and seemingly harmless, shots. Picture: Supplied\n\nSpeaking to NewsWire, Ms Clarke said the shortcomings of Laotian infrastructure meant travellers should carefully consider whether a visit was worth the risk.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be enticing people to go to Laos, far from it. I think our message would really be to avoid it at all costs because they can\u2019t run a thorough investigation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf you happen to die in Laos, there\u2019s no way that you\u2019d get a legitimate medical evaluation and those Danish girls (Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21), they didn\u2019t even have a post-mortem because they were told that they couldn\u2019t do one because of the embalming procedure.\u201d\n\nMs Coyman and Ms Sorensen were found dead in their hostel room after they had reportedly been vomiting blood for 13 hours.\n\nBethany Clarke is now based out of Brisbane and is calling for more education on the dangers of bootleg alcohol. Picture: Lachie Millard\n\n\u201cWe were diagnosed with food poisoning, which is completely incorrect,\u201d Ms Clarke said.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t even displaying symptoms in relation (to that). I wasn\u2019t displaying symptoms like nausea or diarrhoea or vomiting, so I don\u2019t even know how you\u2019d come to that conclusion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that doctors are not trained (properly).\u201d\n\nMs Clarke said the severity of the incident was compounded by the victims\u2019 own inability to think and function as the effects of methanol made its way through their bodies.\n\n\u201cI think because my brain wasn\u2019t working, there were little red flags during that following day, but it\u2019s only afterwards that I\u2019ve sort of been able to realise that I should have listened more to those. I just wasn\u2019t thinking. I wasn\u2019t able to think straight,\u201d Ms Clarke said.\n\n\u201cAt the kayaking experience when we were just having to lay down, we weren\u2019t able to sit up straight and paddle. That definitely should have been a red flag because that\u2019s never happened to me before, an inability to sort of move my body.\n\n\u201cJust really, really fatigued. And then later on, when Simone stopped breathing normally and wasn\u2019t able to look at me properly, that was also when I knew that there was a huge problem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI just felt completely powerless because I couldn\u2019t even think straight myself.\u201d\n\nMs Clarke and Ms White went on a river experience the day after the poisoning but were unable to perform basic tasks like sitting up and paddling. Picture: Supplied\n\nThe pair were best friends. Picture: Supplied\n\nNow Ms Clarke is campaigning for greater awareness, education and preventive measures against similar incidents.\n\nAs part of the campaigning, Ms Clarke has started a petition proposing airports display clearly visible signs, distribute leaflets and have mandatory guidance counters with information on methanol poisoning.\n\n\u201cI think the depth of knowledge will only really come with the formal education in schools and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to think of how we can do that in a way that\u2019s going to act as a scare tactic for young people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s some kind of video, where we can re-enact what happened in Laos and how quickly things started to deteriorate, some of the other shocking things that happened, like the Danish girls who were vomiting blood and various things like that, which no one would ever really imagine could happen after drinking shots at a hostel bar.\n\n\u201cI think people may even think, \u2018Oh, well, it won\u2019t happen to me\u2019, but if you\u2019re shown the facts and we\u2019ve got pictures of those drinks and what we drank, you see it\u2019s easy to get into these situations unless you know why you shouldn\u2019t do something.\u201d",
