(Supplied)\n\nMazitelli had just finished a 30-year career in mining in Queensland's north and finally wanted to enjoy the fruits of his back-breaking labour.\n\n\"I turned 60, wanted to retire and spend a bit of money on myself,\" Mazitelli told 9news.com.au .\n\n\"In 2023 I was online and I saw this advertisement which said 'you can improve your super', I filled out a form and before I knew it I got a call.\"\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nMazitelli was told he'd be able to secure his retirement with better returns, so he transferred his money to Australian Practical Super, known as AusPrac.\n\nHe heard nothing more and assumed everything was OK.\n\nAfter a year, it was time for Mazitelli to hang up his boots and retire.\n\nHe had a healthy nest egg of just over $240,000 to enjoy in his twilight years.\n\nWhen he went to pull it out, the nightmare began.\n\nHe couldn't access a single cent.\n\n\"Then I saw that First Guardian had gone into liquidation and my money had been frozen,\" Mazitelli said.\n\nLike many Australians stung by First Guardian's collapse, Mazitelli said he'd never heard of this fund.\n\nThe former mining worker said he wanted to retire at 60 but had to pause his plans. (Supplied)\n\nAround 6000 people who are missing some or all of their superannuation after the collapse of First Guardian Master Trust, which went into liquidation and is under investigation by corporate regulator ASIC.\n\nASIC began investigating First Guardian's responsible entity Falcon Capital and First Guardian.\n\nAusPrac, also known as Australian Practical Superannuation, is operated by parent company Sequoia Financial Group.\n\nDiversa is the trustee for AusPrac.\n\nIn a statement to impacted members, Diversa said it understands AusPrac members who invested in a First Guardian Master Fund may be experiencing \"stress, anxiety and feelings of uncertainty in response to significant financial losses\".\n\n9news.com.au has contacted Sequoia for comment but is yet to receive a reply.\n\nNine.com.au is not suggesting any wrongdoing by AusPrac.\ufeff\n\nThe long and complicated process of trying to win back even a fraction of Mazitelli's nest egg has been going on for 12 months.\n\nRetirement is now out of the question and he has been forced to return to work as a truck driver.\n\nHe's looking at another 10 years of work at the very least.\ufeff\n\nThe emotional burden of losing his financial freedom has taken a toll too.\n\nMazitelli is now among 12,000 Australians waiting for answers. (Supplied)\n\n\"If I make it to 70\u2026 that's probably how long I'll be working,\" he said.\n\n\"My life has now changed because I wanted to get away and do stuff, I can't anymore. It's had a huge impact.\n\n\"At my age I shouldn't cry but I do, I am angry a lot\u2026 now it's just each day wondering and hoping for a resolution.\"\n\nMazitelli has joined a Facebook group of 1300-strong people who have also lost their superannuation.\n\nAround 12,000 Australians are missing a combined total of $1.2 billion after the collapse of First Guardian and Shield Master Trust.\n\nMembers of the group are supporting and counselling each other as the ASIC investigation takes place.\n\nVictims of both collapses are demanding government action \u2013 and fast.\n\n\"The government needs to intervene now\u2026 to safeguard and watch every superannuation fund so that this doesn't happen to anyone else,\" Mazitelli said.\n\n\"We are all just normal and hardworking Australians who did nothing wrong.\"\n\nHundreds of victims have lodged complaints with The Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).\n\nMazitelli has contacted his local member Andrew Wilcox, the MP for Dawson in north Queensland, who said he will advocate on his behalf.\n\nA Change.org petition has also been started to ask the government to establish a victims' trust.\ufeff\n\nASIC's full statement\n\nASIC has an ongoing investigation in relation to First Guardian Master Fund and Falcon Capital.\n\nFollowing concerns raised by ASIC, the Federal Court appointed liquidators to Falcon Capital and ordered the wind-up of First Guardian and its related funds in April.\n\nThe court also restrained David Anderson, a director of Falcon, from dealing with his assets and appointed a receiver to his personal property.\n\nASIC's investigation suggests that potential consumers were called and referred to personal financial advice providers who advised consumers to roll their superannuation assets into a retail choice superannuation fund, and then to invest part or all of their superannuation into First Guardian.\n\nWhile ASIC's investigation is ongoing, the Federal Court has made interim travel restraint orders against Falcon Capital director David Anderson on ASIC's application. The Court also made interim orders freezing the assets of another Falcon director, Simon Selimaj and restraining his travel.\n\nThose orders are in place until 27 February 2026. We understand the circumstances surrounding First Guardian are distressing for those affected and it is one of ASIC's priorities to investigate what has happened and to preserve as much of investors' funds as possible while our investigation is continuing.\n\nSo far, ASIC has had more than 40 court appearances on matters related to First Guardian and Shield. We have taken a range of enforcement action with respect to these matters including:\n\nstop orders to prevent ongoing consumer harm,\n\ncommencing court proceedings to preserve assets and restrict travel of persons of interest,\n\nappoint receivers and liquidators with the aim of securing investor funds\n\nexecuting numerous search warrants with the assistance of the Australian Federal Police.\n\ncancelled licences and banned certain financial advisers.",

(Getty)\n\nAnd chlamydia remains the most prevalent STI\ufeff, with 101,742 diagnoses last year, though the rate remains steady.\n\nHIV diagnoses, on the other hand, have fallen by \ufeff27 per cent in the past year, though mostly in Australia-born residents.\n\nOther numbers showed there were significant gaps in sexual health in Australia.\n\nPeople are urged to use prevention during sex. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOne recent analysis from the Australian Survey of Health and Relationships found only 16 per cent of Australians aged 16 to 49 had ever been tested for an STI, and only 50 per cent had ever discussed sexual health with their doctors.\n\n\"These data, on a backdrop of rising STIs, are concerning,\" Kirby Institute epidemiologist Dr Skye McGregor said.\n\n\"Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis are easily treated and cured with antibiotics. Early testing, diagnosis and treatment prevents serious outcomes.\n\n\"HIV, while not curable, is highly treatable, and diagnosis and starting effective treatment early prevents poor health outcomes and interrupts onward transmission.\n\n\"These data are a reminder that regular sexual health testing, including syphilis and HIV, is crucial.\"\n\nOnly 50 per cent of Australians discuss sexual health with their care provider. (Getty)\n\nSTI rates remain higher in Indigenous Australians, with \ufeffchlamydia diagnosed at more than twice the rate, gonorrhoea almost four times higher, and syphilis more than five times higher, than in non-Indigenous people.\n\n\"These gaps are even starker in regional and remote areas,\" Robert Monaghan, a Bundjalung-Gumaynggir man and manager of the Yandamanjang First Nations Health Research Program at the Kirby Institute, said.\n\n\"What's needed now is real investment in culturally safe, community-driven health promotion, testing and treatment.\n\n\"Declaring syphilis a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance is an important step.\n\n\"Sustainable change depends on culturally safe, community-led action.\"\n\nMen are also overrepresented in STI numbers, accounting for eight out of 10 syphilis diagnoses, and seven out of 10 gonorrhoea diagnoses.\n\nBut syphilis infections are increasing faster for women, quadrupling across the decade.\ufeff\n\n\"It's important that everyone who is sexually active discusses sexual health with their partners, practices safe sex, has regular STI testing, and talks to their health care provider about their sexual health,\" McGregor said.",

        "text": "Australians receiving the aged pension could end up with slightly more money in their pockets when Centrelink payments increase from Saturday.\n\nMore than 5 million people will see an increase in their bank account because of the increases, the Department of Social Services says.\n\nBut not every payment is increasing.\n\nAnd increases to deeming rates could reduce how much some part-rate pensioners receive.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhich payments are increasing?\n\nAge Pension\n\nCarer Payment\n\nDisability Support Pension\n\nCommonwealth Rent Assistance\n\nJobSeeker\n\nABSTUDY (aged 22 and over)\n\nParenting Payment\n\nWhy are these payments increasing?\n\nTo keep up with the inflation rate.\n\nThe federal government regularly indexes social security payments so the value of benefits like a pension stays the same as the cost-of-living increases.\n\nHow much more will I get?\n\nThat depends on what payments you're currently receiving.\n\nFor example, the Aged Pension, Carer Payment and Disability Support Pension will increase by $29.70 per fortnight for singles.\n\nAnd it'll go up by $44. 80 for couples combined.\n\nYou can check exactly how much your payments will go up by via the detailed table published on the Department of Social Services website.\n\nWhen will the increases kick in?\n\nIndexation will be applied on Saturday.\n\nThe changes will be applied automatically, so recipients won't have to do anything to ensure they receive the increases, Services Australia's website says.\n\nThe payments are being increased to keep up with inflation. (Getty/Matt King)\n\nWhy aren't other payments increasing?\n\nIt's not their turn yet.\n\n\"Different payment rates and thresholds are indexed on different dates throughout the year,\" a Services Australia payment guide says.\n\nEach quarter, a certain number of payments \u2014 but not all of them \u2014 are indexed.\n\nFor example, pension payments were last indexed back in March.\n\nWhereas Youth Allowance was indexed in January.\n\nWhat are the changes to deeming rates?\n\nDeeming rates will increase from Saturday.\n\nThe lower deeming rate: Increase from 0.25 to 0.75 per cent\n\nIncrease from 0.25 to 0.75 per cent The upper deeming rate: Increase from 2.25 to 2.75 per cent\n\n\"We'll automatically apply the new deeming rates if you have deemed income,\" Services Australia's website says.\n\nWhat is deeming?\n\nIt's part of the income test for Centrelink payments, including the age pension.\n\nDeeming is a set of rules the government uses to work out how much income people earn from their financial assets \u2014 things like shares, superannuation, and bank accounts.\n\nIt assumes people receive a set income from the interest on those investments, whether they actually get that much or not.\n\nBut here's the kicker: if your investment return is higher than the deemed rate, the government doesn't count that extra money as part of your income.\n\nThat means anything you earn above that rate isn't counted in the income test for the age pension.\n\nAnd this means the lower the deeming rate, the more people can earn from their investments without it affecting their pension payments.\n\nThe increase to deeming rates could impact payments for some part-pensioners. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\nThe Coalition government cut deeming rates back in 2020 to help retirees in the pandemic, with both parties pledging to freeze those rates leading up to the election in 2022.\n\nIt meant there was a bigger gap between the amount the government assumed some pensioners earned on their savings and what they actually earned, University of Sydney's Professor of Finance Susan Thorp wrote in a piece for The Conversation.\n\nLabor continued that freeze in the 2024 budget, but now that's coming to an end.\n\nWhy is the deeming rate increasing?\n\nIt's part of a staged return to what the rates were before the COVID pandemic.\n\nHere's how it was explained in a media release from Social Services Ministers Tanya Plibersek and Ged Kearney:\n\n\"Deeming rates were frozen at artificially low levels as an emergency COVID-19 measure and the Albanese government extended the freeze to help shield age pensioners and other income support recipients while the economy recovered. \"Social security recipients impacted by deeming saved around $1.8 billion as a result. \"As Australians begin to feel the positive impacts of inflation easing, the government will now gradually return deeming rates to pre-pandemic settings \u2014 that is, to reflect rates of return that pensioners and other payment recipients can reasonably access on their investments.\"\n\nHow could the deeming increase impact retirees?\n\nIt could reduce some pensioners' payments, Professor Thorp wrote for the Conversation.\n\nIn terms of how things could change after Saturday, she gave the example of a single, home-owning age pensioner.\n\n\"The savings and investments that a single pensioner can hold and still get the full pension under the income means test will be lower, because the rules will treat them as earning more income,\" Professor Thorp wrote.\n\n\"In addition, the reductions in the pension as financial assets rise will be a bit larger.\n\n\"For every $10,000 in savings and investments above $210,000, the pension will be lowered by $7, since those extra savings will be deemed to earn more than under the pre-announcement rules.\"",

        "text": "An inflatable art piece that made a grand entrance at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and then vanished has now reappeared in an art exhibition in rural NSW.\n\nTwo-time Archibald finalist and creator of iconic surf brand Mambo, Reg Mombassa's skeleton fish motif was part of the parade during the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympics but for the next 23 years, the whereabouts of the inflatable were unknown.\n\nThat is, until artist and director of Coonabarabran's Space Art Gallery Allison Reynolds made a rare discovery at an online auction two years ago.\n\nThe inflatable fish is hard to miss when passing through Coonabarabran. (ABC Western Plains: Lily Plass )\n\nMs Reynolds had an inkling who the artist behind the fish with its supersized tongue and distinctive lips was and obtained the art piece for $250 \u2014 including shipping.\n\nShe said the fish was alongside big sale signs, inflatable stick figures and other advertising devices.\n\n\"Whereas this is quite obviously a piece of art,\" Ms Reynolds said.\n\nMillions witnessed the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympics where the skeletal fish motif was on display. (Supplied)\n\nAfter contacting Reg Mombassa's studio, Ms Reynolds confirmed that the fish was indeed the work of the artist.\n\nHe designed 12 six-metre inflatables, two 20-metre helium-filled dirigibles, three stages and 16 inflatable crowd balls for the Sydney Olympics.\n\nFrom the arena to the country\n\nMs Reynolds thought the skeleton fish motif would make a nice addition to her art gallery.\n\n\"I thought it was going to look amazing above the roof line because we have the old shop frontage with a corrugated iron verandah poking out,\" Ms Reynolds said.\n\n\"I had visitors come through the other day, on the way to Townsville and they said they had to drop in to [see] Reg Mombassa art piece and what was going on.\"\n\nThe exhibition includes other mentions of the skeleton fish motif, dating back to 1990.\n\nAllison Reynolds says she opened the Space Art Gallery in 2017. (ABC Western Plains: Lily Plass )\n\nChris O'Doherty, whose artistic name is Reg Mombassa, believes after the Olympics, the inflatables were either sold off or stored in the Powerhouse, while others were used for festivals and events.\n\n\"I was just pleased that someone was using one of the inflatables from the Olympics,\" Mombassa said.\n\n\" I hope that people that come from the town or elsewhere find it amusing and have a good time basically. \"\n\nChris O'Doherty is better known as Reg Mombassa, and his style is popularised through Mambo Graphics. (ABC News: Eloise Fuss)\n\nThe sculpture has been weather-resistant so far, but to make the art piece more stable, Ms Reynolds had it filled with expanding foam.\n\n\"This is thick vinyl because obviously during the Olympics, you don't want it blowing away,\" Ms Reynolds said.\n\nArtwork brings visitors\n\nThe fish has caught the eye of many locals in town.\n\n\"I thought it was quite amazing and unique. It was lovely that we could get something so different here,\" local Sue Forbes said.\n\nSue Forbes says she recognised the art as Reg Mombassa's once someone pointed it out. (ABC Western Plains: Lily Plass)\n\n\"I've been away for a few days and then came back. And there it was. It's just a lovely expression of imagination. Just exciting, frivolous, life-asserting,\" local Laura Hartley said.\n\nLaura Hartley, who settled in Coonabarabran from Scotland in the 1970s, created her own fish-themed art through weaving for the exhibition.\n\nLaura Hartley says she is inspired by Indigenous fish traps. (ABC Western Plains: Lily Plass )\n\n\"I understand the fascination of the ways things are constructed in the natural world,\" Ms Hartley said.\n\n\" Fish have got life of their own. They invite people, I hope, to get people engaged with plant material. \"\n\nBones are a red thread through Mombassa's work.\n\n\"I do the bones of people, of cars, of trucks, of guns. I do the bone structure of variety [of] things that don't actually have bone structure,\" he said.\n\n\" Bones are structurally and graphically interesting. They have that indication of a living creature that's died. So, there's always that kind of aging paranormal aspect of a bone or a skeleton. \"\n\nMs Reynold's hope for the fish is that it does not go back to a box.",

        "text": "Work demands and a lack of village mean keeping a child at home from care every time they have a sniffle can be a dilemma for many parents.\n\nAnd with sickness so easily spread in childcare settings, it's a decision caregivers are regularly faced with \u2014 especially in the first year or two.\n\n\"Parents have my sympathy on that, there are a lot of demands on time and it can be really hard to judge what is best to do, both for child in the context of all the other dynamics, and commitments a family has,\" says Cathryn Hester, Queensland chair at Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.\n\nShe says sometimes it seems like kids experience several illnesses \"all at once or in quick succession\".\n\nUpper respiratory tract infections, along with vomiting and diarrhoea bugs, are what Dr Hester sees most commonly in her young patients.\n\n\"There are just a lot of kids running around, and they don't have the best hand hygiene or sneeze-covering practices. Also, they have a developing immune system,\" Dr Hester says.\n\nSo, what can help you determine if your child is fit for child care?\n\nWhen a sick child can't attend child care\n\nWhen determining exclusion periods for a child, Australian childcare centres follow guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), explains Nesha Hutchinson, vice president at the Australia Childcare Alliance.\n\nThe mental load of parenting while sick Photo shows Mother sleeping on a couch with her baby on her While Lauren's husband can retreat to the bedroom when sickness strikes, mum life doesn't stop for her.\n\nIn most cases, time away from child care will be based on symptoms.\n\n\"Although some infections can be spread before the person becomes sick, people are usually most infectious when they have symptoms,\" a NHMRC spokesperson says.\n\nFor example, for diarrhoea or vomiting, it's recommended a child is excluded from care \"until there has not been any diarrhoea or vomiting for at least 24 hours\".\n\n\"If the diarrhoea or vomiting are confirmed to be due to norovirus, exclude until there has not been any diarrhoea or vomiting for at least 48 hours.\"\n\nRespiratory symptoms such as cough, runny or blocked nose, and sore throat, are to be assessed based on severity and what other symptoms they're combined with.\n\nThe full guide and fact sheets are available on the NHMRC website.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nThe NHMRC spokesperson says people should also refer to their relevant state or territory health authority, as some exclusion requirements may vary.\n\nIn addition to the guidelines, centres have the option to adopt director discretion, says Ms Hutchinson.\n\n\"For example, at a centre I worked at we had a child who was immunocompromised, going through cancer treatment, and we explained to families up front that our exclusion guidelines were going to be much stricter.\"\n\nIs my child well enough to attend child care?\n\nTo determine whether their child should be excluded, a parent should check whether the symptoms or diagnosed sickness have an exclusion period listed in the childcare service's policy, the NHMRC spokesperson says.\n\n\"Parents should also inform the service of their child's symptoms when reporting their absence.\"\n\nKids who have fevers, rashes, vomiting and diarrhoea, are weak, or not eating and drinking as much should \"never be sent to day care\", says Dr Hester.\n\n\" That child needs to stay home and have a medical assessment. \"\n\nShe says while children often \"bounce back really well\" from viral infections, they can also get \"very sick very rapidly\" and are best cared for at home.\n\nUnwell children are best cared for at home. (Pexels)\n\nIf parents have any doubts, Dr Hester says they should consult with their family GP.\n\n\"They know you and your family history \u2014 they also know what viruses and illnesses are circulating in the community.\"\n\nShe says parents can book a consult via TeleHealth if they are finding it hard to physically get into a clinic.\n\n\"They can help give advice about whether they should be staying home or if it's something they can soldier on with.\"\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush. The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.\n\nMs Hutchinson says she understands it can be tempting for parents to send their child and just \"see how they go\", but the impact can be far-reaching.\n\n\"Dosing them up [with pain relief] just masks the symptoms, and they've just infected however many other children and therefore other families will struggle too.\n\n\"And the child is miserable \u2026 they want to be home with a primary carer and just to get rest and that one-on-one attention, which you can't get in a childcare setting.\"\n\nMyths about illness and child care\n\nParents are given plenty of anecdotal advice when their kids are sick, and some of it can be misleading, says Dr Hester.\n\nFor example, if the mucus coming from their nose is clear, they are fine to attend child care. If it's green or yellow, they are not.\n\n\"As a doctor I am not even remotely interested in the colour of snot,\" Dr Hester says.\n\n\"Some kids can have perfectly clear snot and be very unwell, or even starting to develop serious conditions like whooping cough.\"\n\nMs Hutchinson says she also hears parents talking about children becoming sick from running around in cold air.\n\n\"That's not the case.\"\n\nShe says it's important parents remember childhood educators are not medical health professionals.\n\n\"They do not have the ability to determine if your child is sick or not, all they can do is respond to the symptoms in front of them and respond according to the guidelines.\"\n\nDr Hester says the best thing parents can do is try to prevent illness in the first place by making sure children are up to date with their vaccinations.\n\n\"With flu especially \u2014 I am seeing so many little kids with Influenza A at the moment, which can be largely prevented with vaccinations.\"",

(Supplied: Jacquie Manning)\n\nThis new survey of works made since 2018 continues Reihana's interest in storytelling and revisioning colonial histories, addressing the ongoing impacts of colonisation on representation, identity and our understandings of community and place.\n\nRecasting history for new perspectives\n\nIn these latest works, Reihana casts Ma\u014dri ancestor Tangi'ia, Earth Mother Papat\u016b\u0101nuku, models from the studio of the late New Zealand sculptor William Trethewy, and several 19th century Chinese goldminers at work in Otago.\n\nArguably one of the more well-known characters is Captain James Cook, whose death is just one of the myriad stories presented in her sprawling tableaux In Pursuit of Venus [Infected].\n\nThis large-scale, live-action, eight-minute film is a sly, visually gorgeous, celebratory reclamation of the stories implied and untold in Frenchman Joseph Dufour's colonial, nineteenth century, panoramic wallpaper, Les Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique (The Native Peoples of the Pacific Ocean).\n\nLisa Reihana uses works like Taking Over to recast the position of women in historical stories. (Image courtesy of the artist and Gallery Sally Dan-Cuthbert, Sydney, Australia.)\n\nIn Reihana's version, problematic Enlightenment-era imagery is exchanged for scenes of cultural practice, dance, community gatherings and cross-cultural exchange, with M\u0101ori, Pasifika and First Nations Australian people thriving and accounted for.\n\nThe work, which is represented in Voyager by a large photograph, was a major highlight of the 2017 Venice Biennale.\n\nFor Reihana, who is of Ng\u0101puhi, Ng\u0101ti Hine, Ng\u0101hi T\u016b descent, its popular and critical reception has led to numerous international commissions and exhibitions.\n\nBut it hasn't been without its challenges.\n\n\"It's fantastic to make a really great work but it's also a rod on your back, because everyone has a touchstone [now] and they want more of that and I don't want to repeat things,\" she says.\n\n\" They have to have a reason to be created again. I've only got one life and I need to keep moving. \"\n\nBut for Reihana, the technical skills required to make these virtuosic works are the easy part.\n\n\"The relationships are the hardest bit but they're also the best bit,\" she says.\n\nNavigating relationships\n\nReihana says telling cultural stories can be fraught, which is why collaboration and giving time to projects is central to her practice.\n\nThere's also a lot of joy and, occasionally, a bit of matchmaking.\n\n\"Sometimes I've cast people because I want them to meet each other, because I think they would get on and then go off and do something else themselves,\" she says.\n\nLisa Reihana: New artwork reanimates the story of Captain Cook Photo shows A wall projection of painted Tahitian landscape featuring filmed figures in 18th C dress re-enacting scenes from first contact. Maori artist Lisa Reihana spent 10 years creating her panoramic digital video In Pursuit of Venus [Infected].\n\nIn IHI (2020), she cast New Zealand choreographers Nancy Wijohn and Taane Mete in her retelling of the M\u0101ori creation story, bringing them back to dance together for the first time in 20 years.\n\n\"I knew they were great friends and to have that sense of care and love displayed between these different stories was something that I wanted to explore,\" she says.\n\nOther times, it's all about research and locations. GOLD_LEAD_WOOD_COAL (2024) was first made for Hong Kong's Tai Kwun Contemporary and, in wanting to create a work that connected Hong Kong and China with Aotearoa, Reihana took the story of the British cargo ship SS Ventnor as her point of departure.\n\nShipwrecked off the coast of New Zealand's North Island in 1902, it was repatriating the remains of 500 Chinese goldminers to Guangdong when it hit the coast and sank.\n\nReihana expands the story to focus on the rituals and care of the local M\u0101ori community, who collected and buried these washed-up boxes of bones.\n\n\"I wanted to look at that care, how humans care for each other; the Chinese miners looking out for each other in the face of a lot of racism and the care that M\u0101ori had for these Chinese bones when they found them on the shores,\" she says.\n\nAcross three expansive walls at the gallery, interior scenes, moody landscapes, calligraphic writings and rich fabric textures cross-fade and overlap, connecting Otago's rugged goldfields to opium dens, to the northern Aotearoa shores and M\u0101ori locals, to the female victims of the Opium Wars held in the prison that once sat on the site of the Tai Kwun arts precinct.\n\nA work about belonging\n\nIn making work specifically for Ngununggula, Reihana hoped to collaborate with local First Nations cultural custodians and community members.\n\nReihana's newest exhibition spans all four gallery spaces at Ngununggula, (Image courtesy of the artist and Gallery Sally Dan-Cuthbert, Sydney, Australia)\n\nHowever, pandemic-complicated timelines and logistics made that tricky.\n\nInstead, she drew on conversations with the daughter of late local elder Aunty Velma Mulcahy, who gifted Ngununggula its name, which means \"belonging\" in the local Gundungurra language.\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa Reihana's Belong shimmers across the front facade of the gallery. (Artwork courtesy of Lisa Reihana and Gallery Sally Dan-Cuthbert, Sydney. Photography by Mim Stirling.) \"I was thinking about that naming and how she talked about it as being a safe place for creativity and for people coming together and for community,\" Reihana says.\n\nReihana's Belong (2025), which adorns the entire front facade of the building, is a dazzling pink, orange and black wall of shimmering pixel-like discs that murmur and shimmer in the wind.\n\nThe zigzag design draws from the patterns found at the top of woven k\u0101kahu, or M\u0101ori cloaks.\n\nReihana knows first-hand the importance of belonging \u2014 of crossing thresholds \u2014 and of being welcomed somewhere.\n\nM\u0101ramatanga is the first work to greet you once you've passed through Belong and entered the galleries.\n\nIt was commissioned by Reihana's alma mater, Auckland University, and was another collaboration, this time with students from the university's dance program, which didn't exist when Reihana was a student.\n\n\"As a young urban woman looking to learn about my culture, because it was so stamped out, it was very hard even to learn language,\" she says.\n\n\"You couldn't find it in our English education system. It was a real milestone moment when the university finally capitulated and decided to build a marae, or meeting house, for all the M\u0101ori students, and for the wider university.\"\n\nThe University of Auckland built a marae, or meeting house, for all the M\u0101ori students, and for the wider university. (Supplied: University of Auckland)\n\nOn finding your place\n\nThat experience, as well as the opportunity to meet the master artisans who carved its interiors, rich with depictions of M\u0101ori ancestors and navigators, continues to be formative for Reihana.\n\nGiant octopus heads for Hobart Photo shows Inflatable octopus artwork in marina. When Lisa Reihana constructed an enormous octopus based on a M\u0101ori creation story, she never intended it to leave its home in New Zealand.\n\n\"We talk about the meeting house as being your T\u016brangawaewae, your place to stand. And wherever you stand [with the carvings behind you], you've got the protection of your people behind your back,\" she says.\n\nFor M\u0101ramatanga, Reihana invited the students and several older friends to take inspiration from the figures in the marae, as well as their own ancestors, and to reflect on what they might look like for themselves within a contemporary choreographic video piece.\n\nOne of the dancers, Yin-Chi Lee, spoke of her experiences as being part of the Chinese diaspora and feeling landless; a constant guest in other countries. Using green screens, Reihana suspends her in the open sky.\n\n\"She feels landless and unbound. So it's about taking these ideas and trying to translate them in a way that still is poetic but that gives somebody a place to be.\"\n\nOther vignettes capture dancers-as-ancestors against hypnotic, kaleidoscopic backgrounds of ocean, forest and mangroves.\n\nReihana's work breathes new life into historical narratives. (Image courtesy of the artist and Gallery Sally Dan-Cuthbert, Sydney, Australia)\n\nThese mesmerising visuals define all of Reihana's work, whether she's retelling M\u0101ori ancestral stories or re-writing colonial histories.\n\nTheir uplifting beauty is another strategy \u2014 an invitation for viewers to lose themselves in the stories and perhaps re-emerge with a new perspective or appreciation.\n\n\"I'm bringing something of my world \u2014 and other people's worlds \u2014 and I'm re-showing them in this space and it's a real gift [to be able to do that],\" she says.\n\n\"I think the politics today is just so weird and so scary. So I think having all these different cultures and people together says a lot.\"\n\nLisa Reihana: Voyager is at Ngununggula, Bowral, until November 9.",

        "text": "As the local government elections loom, a debt-laden shire in Western Australia's Goldfields has submitted its final plea to avoid suspension following serious financial mismanagement concerns.\n\nLocal Government Minister Hannah Beazley gave the Shire of Coolgardie a show cause notice on August 26, allowing the council three weeks to prove it should not be stood down.\n\nThe shire responded to the notice yesterday and said it had answered \"all questions and statements raised by the minister\".\n\nThe minister is yet to make a decision on the future of the council.\n\nHow did Coolgardie get here?\n\nIn June, WA's Auditor General's office provided an audit of the Shire of Coolgardie's 2023-24 annual financial report to Ms Beazley.\n\nIt found a host of financial and managerial mismanagement incidents, including the use of restricted funds to cover shortfalls, and the improper employment of a man working remotely from a Caribbean island.\n\nCouncil documents showed on June 30, the shire carried a debt of $27.5 million, while owing creditors $2.8 million, with just $2.9 million cash in the bank.\n\nHannah Beazley has described the Shire of Coolgardie as a \"financial mess\". (ABC Perth: Courtney Withers)\n\nIn response, Ms Beazley rose in state parliament and slammed the shire for \"gross mismanagement\".\n\nBefore the show cause notice, the minister proposed a \"boundary adjustment\" with its much larger neighbour the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder and requested a joint submission on the proposals by both local governments.\n\nOpposition to boundary adjustment\n\nThe proposal prompted immediate backlash from ratepayers in both councils, with dozens of ratepayers writing to the minister.\n\nCoolgardie ratepayer Jan McLeod holding a placard at protests outside the Shire of Coolgardie offices in April. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)\n\nCoolgardie residents raised concerns over a loss of identity and key services, while Kalgoorlie-Boulder residents opposed taking on Coolgardie's debt.\n\nIn July, the Shire of Coolgardie submitted its individual position paper formally opposing the proposal.\n\nIts financial recovery plan outlined its path to be debt-free by 2035.\n\nThe shire also put its controversial Bluebush Accommodation Village up for sale by public tender, which as of March was valued between $16.4 to $19.4 million.\n\nCity of Kalgoorlie-Boulder's position unclear\n\nThe City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder has kept its position on the boundary adjustment confidential.\n\nHowever, at a public meeting earlier this month, Mayor Glenn Wilson said the city had been unable to take a formal position due to a lack of cooperation from the Shire of Coolgardie.\n\nGlenn Wilson attended an ad hoc meeting between ratepayers of both councils earlier this month.

        "text": "Player injuries are costing AFL clubs millions of dollars, as experts say club medical and performance departments are being put under strain when hit with a plethora of injuries across a season.\n\nNew research has highlighted the financial impact of injuries in the AFL, with one club losing $13 millions over six seasons, nearly 17 per cent of its total player salaries.\n\nLed by the University of Canberra's Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, the study analysed one professional AFL club over six seasons and found injury-related absences accounted for around 20 per cent of all possible matches lost, with hamstring injuries alone costing $2 million over that period.\n\nThe study suggests the AFL's soft cap \u2014 despite recent increases \u2014 still limits the investment in injury prevention and medical staffing, restricting clubs' ability to fully implement injury prevention strategies, ultimately driving up costly injury-related losses.\n\nNic Martin of the Bombers was one of 16 senior players who finished the year on the injury list at Essendon. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nThis year Essendon was hit by a highly publicised injury crisis and was forced to roll out a record-breaking 15 debutants with more than 30 per cent of the senior list unavailable at times.\n\nSixteen senior players ended the season on the injury list, which included some unlucky injuries such as Harry Jones's ankle dislocation as well as repeat soft tissues injuries likeJordan Ridley's hamstring strain and four ACLs.\n\nFor numerous weeks throughout the season, Essendon coach Brad Scott spoke about reviewing the club's medical program, investigating how it prepares its players and allocating extra resources to the under-fire strength and conditioning program.\n\nAs Bombers battle injury bug, these silent factors lead to athletes getting hurt Photo shows Zach Merrett leads Essendon players onto the ground Essendon has been hit with an injury toll that has rarely been seen in professional sports. ABC Sport spoke to a physiotherapist to help gain an understanding of the various factors that result in professional athletes getting hurt.\n\nThe club announced in July that high performance boss Sean Murphy would finish up when his contract expired at the end of the season replaced by Dr Mathew Inness from West Coast.\n\nNick Kane, who finished working at Essendon in February after 10 years, five of which he served as lead physiotherapist, said when senior players get injured the loads then increase on other and particularly younger players, who might not be ready for such demands.\n\n\"The other side of the coin is potentially most clubs are staffed to handle a range of anywhere from five to seven injuries at a time, but anything above that starts becoming very difficult to really manage every one of those players to the detail and effectiveness that they need,\" said Kane, who has founded an organisation aimed at better education for physios and rehab specialists.\n\n\"So then you're talking about the physios and the rehab staff and high performance stuff being overloaded with eight, 10, 12 people in rehab \u2026 it can lead to a sort of tipping point, where it becomes a really big impact on the team's output and performance.\"\n\nNick Kane finished working at Essendon in February after 10 years, five of which he served as lead physiotherapist. (Supplied: Nick Kane.)\n\nKane said Essendon staff and physios would have been feeling immense pressure.\n\n\"They'd be doing their very best work. And they are very good staff, because I know them and very good at what they do,\" Kane said.\n\n\"But ultimately, same with any role, when you [get] completely swept under and in this case the demand of what's needed is probably greater than what you have from a staffing number to be able to deliver that, it gets to a tipping point where it boils over a little bit.\n\n\"So for them, it would have been quite a difficult process throughout the year to keep it going. I think they've done a really good job with the resources they've got.\"\n\nEssendon star details toll of brutal injury Photo shows GettyImages-2206309175 Essendon ruck Sam Draper detailed the emotional toll of his season-ending Achilles rupture, which he said felt very unfair given his career-best form this year.\n\nMatt Turnbull, author in the study and former head of performance at North Melbourne, says indirect costs like salaries probably well exceed direct costs, such as healthcare, scans, seeing external doctors and surgeries.\n\n\"What we're looking at there is the cost of productivity loss or the cost of absenteeism \u2014 and so in the context of sport, it's the cost of a player missing a match due to injury and illness,\" Turnbull said.\n\nThe most costly injuries in the study were hamstrings, biceps, femoral strains, concussions and soleus (calf) strains.\n\n\"What it does is it helps us determine where to target our resources,\" Turnbull said.\n\n\"[And] what we do know about injuries now is that once there's an index injury in a season, meaning the first injury someone sustains, their risk of subsequent injury is much higher than even a recurrence.\n\n\"So that is, their risk of injuring their calf while they're returning from a hamstring injury is quite high. So putting more emphasis on preventing injuries in the preseason is really important.\"\n\nExperts say indirect costs of player unavailability can be higher than direct costs of injuries to clubs. (Getty: Russell Freeman/AFL Photos)\n\nKane said, ultimately, the increase of injuries to a club means the less likely they are to have on-field success.\n\n\"Likewise, when it comes to the individual level for athletes, every injury they experience throughout the year, the chance of them reaching optimal performance decreases,\" Kane said.\n\n\"So ultimately, when we talk around injury [and] injury prevention, what we're talking around is ultimately player availability and the impact that has on the team's success, which can be really significant.\"",

But it's great to have the research to back it up.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Business Research, shows narcissistic leadership \"erodes middle managers\u2019 sense of belonging and connection to their organisation. In practice, that means fewer new ideas, less willingness to challenge strategy and a greater risk of groupthink.\"\n\nCo-author of the study, Dr Miles Yang, Senior Lecturer in Strategy at Macquarie Business School:\n\n\u201cWhen middle managers feel dismissed or undervalued by the top, they withdraw rather than risk confrontation. \u201cThe irony is that these are the very people who usually spot risks first and push for innovation.\u201d\n\n\u2018Divergent strategic behaviour\u2019 \u2014 a great name for challenging ideas\n\nThe researchers ran scenario-based experiments that tested how different CEO behaviours shaped managers\u2019 willingness to engage in what\u2019s known as \u2018divergent strategic behaviour\u2019 \u2014 putting forward ideas that challenge the status quo.\n\nParticipants were presented with short scenarios describing either a high-narcissism CEO (boastful, dismissive, taking all the credit) or a low-narcissism CEO (inclusive, appreciative, encouraging ideas).\n\nThose exposed to the narcissistic leader were far less likely to feel connected to their organisation or to suggest new strategies.\n\nHere's co-author Associate Professor Yue Wang, Associate Professor in International Business at Macquarie Business School.\n\n\u201cNarcissistic CEOs are often easy to recognise once you\u2019ve worked with them \u2014 they monopolise the spotlight, claim sole credit and show little interest in other viewpoints,\u201d says \u201cBut during hiring, they can come across as charming and visionary, which makes it harder for boards to see the warning signs.\u201d\n\nHere's what the reasearchers say is the 'takeaway' from the study\n\nCharisma and bold vision may grab headlines, but they\u2019re no substitute for inclusive leadership. The new study shows narcissism at the top weakens the very people organisations rely on to adapt and innovate.\n\nFor boards, the message is clear: beware of leaders who demand admiration but dismiss those beneath them.

Bulldozing character-filled federation, art deco and mid-century homes to make way for big boxy houses or uninspiring townhouses that don\u2019t add amenity, density or quality of housing infuriates him. \u201cI\u2019ll document all the ones I can. I\u2019ll save them in my own way with pencil and pen,\u201d said Smith, an architectural artist, of the homes he draws. Smith says he is neither a NIMBY nor a YIMBY, but a QIMBY \u2013 a proponent of quality in my backyard and not just development for its own sake. He would like to see more initiatives to adapt existing housing, partly because of the embedded carbon, but also to preserve well-built homes with decorative details that are likely to be replaced by uninspiring townhouses and units. Jason Smith has been drawing and photographing houses slated for demolition to document Sydney\u2019s architectural history. Credit: Janie Barrett Single house demolitions across Sydney\u2019s inner and middle-ring areas, including Kensington, Denistone, Arncliffe, North Sydney, Padstow and Camperdown, mostly ended in newer and bigger homes being built on the same site, new Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows. Despite a rebuild rate of 2.1 new homes for each house demolished across the state, more than 80 per cent of knockdowns in 40 well-located or affluent Sydney suburbs \u2013 close to transport and amenities \u2013 were replaced by enlarged or upgraded houses. Across NSW, 77,279 dwellings were approved to be flattened and rebuilt into housing over the five years to June 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anticipated destruction of more homes as part of the NSW government\u2019s multi-faceted plans to increase supply and density has historians, architects and others pushing to document these soon-to-be-bulldozed buildings and streetscapes before they disappear. Dr Jennifer Preston, chair of the Australian Institute of Architects heritage committee in NSW, said with the \u201csignificant changes\u201d the planned transport-oriented development proposals would bring to the city, \u201cperhaps we should again look at formally documenting the sites and streetscapes of buildings planned for demolition\u201d. The ABS noted in its August report: \u201cMost knock-down rebuilds are not adding to overall housing stock, but instead are used as a means of significantly upgrading an existing detached dwelling.\u201d Smith is inspired by the artist Joseph Fowles, whose book of drawings, Sydney in 184,8 was designed to depict the city as it truly was, rather than as the English imagined it. The Herald interviewed Smith on the footpath outside two charming century-old full-brick bungalows in Wahroonga, which he drew for his Instagram account. They were \u201coff to the tip\u201d to make way for \u201cuninspiring townhouses\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith says he is not anti-development. \u201cWe have to have development. I\u2019m not silly or stupid enough to think that we\u2019re going to save every single house,\u201d Smith said. It is an impossible task to record every home being demolished, nor does anyone think it is warranted. An average of 16,753 dwellings got demolition approval and were rebuilt each year from 2019-20 to 2024-25. Despite the government\u2019s push for increased density, 58 per cent of knockdown rebuilds nationwide were replaced by another detached single dwelling. In NSW, that figure was 54.8 per cent. In the late 19th century, the City of Sydney\u2019s City Surveyor took advantage of the camera, then a new technology, to document homes threatened with demolition. This resulted in the Demolition Books, containing 5000 photographs and glass plate negatives \u2013 not all the homes were knocked down, some were only threatened. City historian Laila Ellmoos said from 1879 the council had the power to demolish any ruinous building by issuing the owner a condemnation notice to compel either a repair or demolition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorian Laila Ellmoos looks at one of the glass plate negatives uncovered by the City of Sydney archives team. Credit: Kate Geraghty Photos documenting this process are now a rich record of the city\u2019s social history. \u201cA hundred years later, you can say, thanks for that. Now I can see how Sydneysiders lived 100 years ago,\u201d Ellmoos said. \u201cWhat you see in those photographs [of Sydney] is poverty. It\u2019s not a wealthy city at that time, people are really struggling.\u201d The photos showed children in bare feet and women picking through abandoned sites for building materials. \u201cThen you can see all the building materials, which were recycled.\u201d Smith said the great value of the demolition books was that they document what was lost. \u201cSydney has always had a short-sighted love affair with demolition; only for the next generation to despair at what is gone. We can look up with envy at the Queen Victoria Building today \u2013 three times slated for demolition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

If the hippocampus thinks the smell is important or connected with a particularly emotional moment, it can \u201cfile\u201d the information and store it indefinitely. Smith began his academic career in philosophy, studying the area of mind and perception. After a stint as a wine columnist, he founded the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London\u2019s School of Advanced Study in 2011, alongside eminent neuroscientists such as the late Professor Colin Blakemore. Their brief was to study multisensory perception. The idea is that our senses don\u2019t just exist in isolation, but that they inform one another. \u201cWe don\u2019t just hear or see \u2013 everything is interconnected,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThe most multisensory experience is tasting, and most of tasting is due to smell. It\u2019s the combination of the two that creates flavour.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the rest of the world sat up and started to take notice. \u201cMainstream science didn\u2019t pay much attention until COVID,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut when anosmia emerged as one of the symptoms, online searches spiked.\u201d In the past few years, more evidence has appeared to suggest that anosmia is a symptom of serious illness or injury.\n\nLoss of smell was a common and distinct symptom of COVID with up to 60 per cent of sufferers experiencing it. Credit: iStock \u201cYou can lose your sense of smell after a head injury, when nerves to the brain are severed,\u201d says Smith. \u201cSinusitis, or a virus, can also cause anosmia. If there is no discernible cause, we call it \u2018idiopathic\u2019 anosmia. Research has shown that a gradual loss of smell can be a two-year advance warning of conditions such as dementia or Parkinson\u2019s. It may even give clues as far as 12 years in advance.\u201d Researchers have been working on this area for a while. In a 2014 study held in Leipzig, Germany, 7000 participants were given tests on their sensitivity to different smells, their capacity to distinguish between them, and their mental abilities. Those who had the keenest sense of smell also did better on the cognitive tests. Conversely, the weaker their \u201cnose\u201d, the worse they scored in verbal fluency, memorisation and attention span. A 2021 study at San Diego State University in California found that people\u2019s performance on odour sensitivity tests appeared to predict who would go on to develop mild cognitive impairment and who would develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These tests were seen to be a better predictor of the condition\u2019s progression than the mental state examination used by GPs and neurologists. Scientists are also finding links between olfactory dysfunction and depression. A 2022 study by the Dresden University of Technology in Germany found a correlation between patients\u2019 olfactory ability and symptoms of depressive illness: when their olfactory function improved, so did their mood.\n\nBrain scans seem to agree: olfactory dysfunction is accompanied by loss of grey matter, and a shrinking of the hippocampus. Such changes may explain both the cognitive decline and the rising depression in people with dementia: \u201cSmell loss interferes with the affective and emotion control systems,\u201d says Professor Thomas Hummel of Dresden University, one of the leading experts in this area. Loading Hence, scientists believe olfactory testing could become more useful in early screening for cognitive impairment. \u201cAs the new dementia drugs rely on early intervention, this could be important,\u201d says Smith. If we know that losing your sense of smell is a sign of serious illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can we reverse the equation and train our senses to slow down or even ward off dementia? For now, to claim this would be a stretch, though those working in the field are optimistic that it may one day be shown to be the case. There is more consensus around the theory that realising that paying attention to your sense of smell \u2013 \u201ctraining it,\u201d as it were \u2013 can add to a person\u2019s enjoyment of life, and perhaps enhance their cognitive skills.\n\nSmith is convinced of this, pointing to a number of studies showing that smell training can keep you cognitively more active. \u201cOne study followed people in their 70s, some who did Sudoku, and others who did daily smell training for three months,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ones who did Sudoku just got better at Sudoku. But the ones who did smell training had better recall.\u201d It\u2019s important to point out that these studies are correlative \u2013 as in, no \u201ccause and effect\u201d between smell and a sharper brain has been proved. But Smith feels this does not detract from the validity of their outcomes. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of use it or lose it,\u201d he says. \u201cUnlike your hearing and vision, your sense of smell is underused. This is also in contrast to other animals. Therefore we have spare capacity. There was even a study published in 2016 in the Frontiers of Neuroscience suggesting that perfumers and wine experts have more grey matter than people in other occupations.\u201d As scientists debate the potential of using smell in a clinical setting, Smith remains a flag-bearer for the use of aromas to boost your wellbeing and stimulate your brain. \u201cSmell is bound up with memory, emotion and arousal,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you lose arousal, your emotions are flattened and the world becomes dull and grey.\u201d Can you train your smell for a smarter brain? What is smell training?\n\nIn 2009, Dresden University\u2019s Hummel ran a study to investigate whether repeated short-term exposure to odours over a period of three months would have any effect on the olfactory ability of a group of anosmia sufferers. One group of volunteers was given four essential oils \u2013 and told to sniff each one every day, morning and evening, for 10 seconds at a time over a period of 12 weeks. The other was not. Loading At the end of 12 weeks, researchers found that 30 per cent of the patients who had sniffed the oils had had an improvement in olfactory function, compared with the group who didn\u2019t participate. \u201cSmell training definitely won\u2019t harm and it might help,\u201d says Smith. What were the essential oils in the trial?",

        "text": "Key Points Trump and Xi are set to confirm details of the deal on Saturday AEST.\n\nUS treasury secretary says national security remains priority for the US.\n\nChina called US security fears \"unilateral bullying\" as tariff disputes continue.\n\nUS and Chinese officials said they have reached a framework agreement to switch short-video app TikTok to US-controlled ownership that will be confirmed in a call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential deal on the popular social media app, which counts 170 million US users, was a rare breakthrough in the months-long talks between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economies that have sought to defuse a wide-ranging trade war that has unnerved global markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a meeting with Chinese negotiators in Madrid, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said a 17 September deadline that could have disrupted the app in the US encouraged Chinese negotiators to reach a potential deal.\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about the TikTok deal?\n\nBessent said that deadline could be extended by 90 days to allow the deal to be finalised, but declined to discuss specifics of the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said when commercial terms of the deal are revealed, it will preserve cultural aspects of TikTok that Chinese negotiators care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're interested in Chinese characteristics of the app, which they think are soft power. We don't care about Chinese characteristics. We care about national security,\" Bessent told reporters at the conclusion of two days of talks in Madrid.\n\n\n\nIt is the second time this year that the two sides have said they were nearing a TikTok deal. The earlier announcement in March ultimately did not pan out.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny agreement could require approval by the Republican-controlled Congress, which passed a law in 2024 requiring divestiture due to fears that TikTok's US user data could be accessed by the Chinese government, allowing Beijing to spy on Americans or conduct influence operations through the app.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Trump administration has repeatedly declined to force a shutdown, which could anger the app's millions of users and disrupt political communications. Trump has credited the app with helping him win re-election last year, and his personal account has 15 million followers. The White House launched an official TikTok account last month.\n\n\n\nUS treasury secretary Scott Bessent (centre) said that US and China have reached an agreement that respects US interests and security, but is also fair to the Chinese side. Source: AAP / J.J. Guillen \"A deal was also reached on a \u201ccertain\u201d company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy!

        "text": "Over the next decade, Elon Musk could become the world's first trillionaire. The Tesla board recently proposed a $1.5 trillion compensation plan if Musk can meet a series of ambitious growth targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's corporate pay packets aren't quite on that scale. Yet even here, last week it was reported that departing Virgin chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka will collect nearly $50 million in shares and other cash benefits on her way out the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch from the United States suggests people think the average CEO earns ten times more than the average worker \u2014 and would prefer it was closer to only five times more.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the real gap in the US over the past decade has been estimated to mean CEOs earn a staggering 265 to 300 times more than average US workers.\n\n\n\nAustralians think CEOs earn seven times more than the average worker and would prefer if it was only three times more.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the real gap here is also much higher. A long-running study found CEOs of the top 100 Australian companies earned 55 times more last financial year than average workers.\n\n\n\nSo, how much money is enough?\n\nPeople have asked this question for thousands of years. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle explained the idea of eudaimonia, or a roadmap of \"living well\", saying it \"belongs more to those who have cultivated their character and mind to the uttermost, and kept acquisition of external goods within moderate limits, than it does to those who have managed to acquire more external goods than they can possibly use, and are lacking goods of the soul.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAristotle's philosophy doesn't call on us to shun money or wealth entirely, but argues it shouldn\u2019t become life's sole focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch over recent decades has come to different conclusions on how much money is needed to achieve peak well-being.\n\n\n\nA US study in 2010 suggested well-being maxes out around US$75,000. This figure naturally needs to be increased today to account for inflation \u2014 which, if those research findings are still true today, would be closer to AU$167,000 in today's dollars. You'd also need to take into account the cost of living in your area.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther findings suggest well-being may continually increase with growing wealth, but the increase in well-being from $1 million to $10 million is likely less than when someone moves from poverty to middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2022 experiment studied 200 people from Brazil, Indonesia, Kenya, Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom who were randomly given US$10,000 (A$15,000 at today's exchange rate).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found people in lower-income countries \"exhibited happiness gains three times larger than those in higher-income countries\", including Australia. But that cash still provided detectable benefits for people with household incomes up to $184,000 today.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarkably, the people in that experiment gave away more than two-thirds of that money to family, friends, strangers and charities.\n\n\n\nValuing time and relationships\n\nDecades of international research have consistently shown that materialistic goals \u2014 acquiring wealth and possessions for reasons associated with image and status \u2014 undermine wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because materialistic striving is often borne out of low self-esteem or tending to compare oneself negatively to others, and there is always someone else to compare yourself against.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople can get stuck on the \"hedonic treadmill\", where they get used to their new level of wealth and the luxuries it provides and then need more to feel happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also because the work needed to acquire that wealth can mean less time focusing on hobbies and with loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard research tracking two generations of men and their children over their lives, going back to 1938, shows deep, meaningful relationships with others are key to mental and physical well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican psychologist Abraham Maslow developed a \"hierarchy\" of people\u2019s \"needs\" in 1943. This suggested \"self-actualisation\" \u2014 reaching your pinnacle of personal growth \u2014 starts by having enough money to cover the basics of food, shelter, and access to the opportunities needed to grow as a person.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line with this, research has shown that \"time affluence\" (maximising free time by paying people to do things you don't want to) and \"experiential buying\" (for example, meals out with loved ones, going on holidays) can support well-being by helping people develop new skills, build relationships, and create lifelong memories.\n\n\n\nIt's in most of our interests to close the wealth gap\n\nRecent data shows that economic inequality in Australia is increasing. This is particularly affecting young Australians, as housing becomes less affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a broader social level, research from the UK indicates that as inequality increases, social outcomes get worse. These include increased crime, drug and alcohol abuse, obesity as people struggle to afford nutritious food, and reductions in social trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of wealth do you think is owned by the richest 20 per cent of Australians? And in your ideal Australia, how much wealth should the richest 20 per cent own?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent Bureau of Statistics data we have, from 2019-20, showed the richest 20 per cent of Australians owned around 62 per cent of our wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs inequality gets worse, evidence suggests it will lead to social problems that threaten to undermine the well-being of the whole community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe irony is those who pursue extreme wealth and benefit most from this inequality will not necessarily be happier or more fulfilled because of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Elphinstone does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n\n\n",

Condom use of course is also important, it can prevent a significant proportion of STIs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, there were nearly 6,000 diagnoses of syphilis, according to a new report from the University of New South Wales' Kirby Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most cases are still in men, infections in women have quadrupled over the past decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were also more than 44,000 diagnoses of gonorrhoea last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd chlamydia remains the country's most diagnosed S-I, with nearly 102,000 cases in 2024 \u2013 around half of which were among people aged 20 to 29 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While we haven't seen much change in the numbers, what we'd like to see is that starting to come down.\n\n\n\n\n\nCases of HIV have actually dropped over the past decade with more than 750 cases recorded last year \u2013 62 per cent attributable to sex between men.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors say preventative medications have helped, but there still needs to be vigilance for other STIs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has experts really alarmed, though, is the rate of congenital syphilis.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr McGregor says it has resulted in 34 infant deaths, recorded over the past decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In pregnancy untreated syphilis can lead to miscarriage, still birth, congenital syphilis \u2013 which can result in life long disability \u2013 and death of infants, so it's a serious and entirely preventable outcome.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore of than half of those deaths were among First Nations people.\n\n\n\n\n\nRates of gonorrhoea, syphilis and chlamydia were also 2 to 5 times higher among the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Monaghan, the Kirby Institute's inaugural Manager of First Nations Health Research, says those figures are deeply alarming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think a lot of that is about access \u2013 access to services \u2013 and timely diagnosis and treatment. That is one of the biggest problems we see, especially more so in our remote Aboriginal communities. It's about choice as well. In most Aboriginal communities, especially remote, you only have one choice \u2013 which is mostly the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service \u2013 which do a marvellous job but they're under capacity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snapshot offered by the report suggests only 16 per cent of people aged 16 to 49 have been tested for an STI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are efforts towards improving rates and stigma, including self-testing kits and STI tele-health appointments.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr McGregor says more needs to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do know that it points to persistent inequities in testing and prevention and healthcare. And certainly that's where we need to focus our efforts to understand who's missing out on testing. If we look, for example, at the congenital syphilis data, we know for mothers who have had infants with congenital syphilis, the majority of those didn't receive testing early in their pregnancy. So, we need to work with the communities most impacted to understand what are the programs contribute to reduction in all of these infections.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat approach, Robert Monaghan says, is also intended to breakdown stigma and shame.\n\n\n\n",

I think it will take a lot to amend that relationship. I don't think the handing down of this report in itself is going to amend that relationship, a lot more needs to be done, and Islamophobia needs to be treated with a level of urgency that we have not seen yet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe register has recorded a 530 per cent increase in incidents since the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Malik\u2019s report - which was commissioned by the government - includes a national plan with 54 recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommendations include to grant Islamophobia the \"same rights, protections, and legal recourse\" as other forms of discrimination; a review of counter-terrorism laws; and the establishment of a commission of inquiry into anti-Palestinian and anti-Arab racism.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says discrimination against Muslim groups in Australia has been persistent, but that number of incidents has risen sharply since October 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Malik says global events can fuel Islamophobia within the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Islamophobia Register has recorded a 150 per cent of increase in verified in-person Islamophobic incidents by November 2024. Online, these incidents skyrocketed to 250 per cent, compared to any other period before that. Despite these reports, Islamophobia remains under-reported, with far more intensity than what these troubling numbers tell us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Islamophobia Register Australia's Queensland-based executive director, Nora Amath, says Muslims feel targeted and afraid against the backdrop of recent anti-migrant rallies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Federation of Ethnic Communities\u2019 Councils of Australia says they are gravely concerned by the escalation of Islamophobic violence and threats in recent days.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading refugee resettlement and multicultural services provider, SSI echoes similar sentiment - condemning Islamophobia incidents in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report outlines a sharp increase in incidents involving prejudice and threats since 2023 - with one in three Australians expressing negative views about Muslims.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also found that Muslim women and girls accounted for three-quarters of all Islamophobia victims, three-fifths of physical assaults and every target of reported spitting incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Multicultural Affairs Minister Anne Aly describes the release of the report as a historic moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Aly says Muslim communities in Australia should not be living in fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What Aftab has done with this report is to give voice, to give voice to Muslim across Australia who have longed endured discrimination, racism and at times, some pretty abhorrent acts of just outright hatred. And often without a form a recourse to pursue on that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the ABC on Sunday Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles says it will take time for his party to go through the recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was questioned if he supports Mr Malik's recommendation on penalising parliamentarians over their racist remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Malik suggested introducing clear contingencies for responses to parliamentarians who engage in hate speech or behaviour, including imposing temporary suspension from the party room or various party-granted roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Marles doesn't directly respond on whether he supports the suggestion, but says racism is not allowed in parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well look, we are gonna go through the process of responding to this report, you know, it's a very significant report, 54 recommendations, so we are gonna give the respect that it deserves and take the time to go through it, but let me be clear, the parliament should not be a place for people to be making racist statements.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMuslim communities in the country say concrete steps to stamp out hate are needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhaled Alamedine, who's the General Director of the Lebanese Islamic Society told SBS Arabic that after the October 7 attacks, they noticed \"the discourse began to portray the Palestinian cause as a fabricated religious issue, reduced solely to Islam\".\n\n\n\n\n\nArabic translated to English \"We affirm that Palestine is not the cause of one religion; rather, it is a national and humanitarian issue that encompasses all components of the Palestinian people, including Muslims, Christians, and others. Palestine does not belong to one group over another, and it is not acceptable to impose a specific religious narrative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanese Muslim Association secretary Gamel Kheir was among those consulted by the Envoy for the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kheir told SBS Arabic he's keen for the government to accept and implement the document's 54 recommendations - including Australia's counter-terrorism approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been very, very strong in our advocating for the fact that the whole concept of definition of terrorism has been unfairly pegged towards the Muslim community selectively only. We've been very much advocating the government and support by the envoy, in the fact that the definition of terrorism needs to be way better defined and less focus on the person's religion, and more focus on the act itself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the government has an obligation now to honour the recommendations and take them seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a joint press conference last week [[Friday]] with Mr Malik, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese dismissed claims that anti-Muslim hate had not been given the same attention as hate directed at other communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have strengthened Commonwealth hate crimes to criminalise threats of violence, force or property damage that targets individuals or groups based upon race, religion or nationality. That applies across the board. We have been consistent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian National Imams Council senior advisor Bilal Rauf says the report strengthens the case for religious protections, which the council has lobbied for.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Australian Muslim Advocacy Network has been more critical.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe network doesn't share the government's rationale for establishing the Islamophobia and antisemitism envoy roles, but welcomes the recommendations.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This includes the unexpected return of the boys\u2019 mother, played by Vanessa Downing, who probably didn\u2019t have to work too hard to be in a state of shock after what had happened to Maiden, and who completed a stellar cast fulfilling Shepard\u2019s manic vision: a snapshot of an America that can tear itself apart. MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nBRIGHT STAR\n\nHayes Theatre, September 11\n\nUntil October 5\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Don\u2019t necessarily judge a musical by its soundtrack. The original Broadway cast recording of Bright Star suggested I was in for a long night. The music and lyrics, by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, are in a bluegrass/country vein, evoking the setting in North Carolina\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains. The songs sounded samey, the singing ordinary, and perhaps there was a good reason why nobody had penned a bluegrass musical before. But that didn\u2019t allow for Steve Martin\u2019s book, with its sharply drawn characters, wit and poignancy \u2013 as well as unabashed melodrama \u2013 melodrama having kept country ballads simmering since folks first donned cowboy boots. Bright Star is Sport for Jove\u2019s first musical. Credit: Robert Catto\n\nIt also didn\u2019t allow for the Broadway album\u2019s singing being completely outgunned in a production devised, improbably, by leading Shakespeare company, Sport for Jove. Why, I\u2019d wondered, would Sport for Jove lower the bar to hick musical theatre? Now I understand. Although this is the company\u2019s first musical, music has long been key to its Shakespeare productions, and Bright Star burnishes rather than clouds its reputation. Directors Miranda Middleton and Damien Ryan and musical director Alec Steedman have assembled a 16-person ensemble, almost all of whom act, sing, dance and play. It seemed only three band members didn\u2019t have a character to play, and only one cast member didn\u2019t play an instrument. That was Hannah McInerney in the pivotal role of Alice Murphy. She has two especially potent songs, Please Don\u2019t Take Him and At Long Last, and they would test the ability of any female singer not to become shrill while squeezing out the show\u2019s emotional marrow. McInerney was superlative \u2013 and also acted her socks off as a literary magazine editor whose newborn babe was ripped from her arms 23 years before. The show zigzags between 1946 and 1923 with an abruptness that initially teases, but we get our heads around it, and learn to trust Martin\u2019s storytelling and invest in his detailed characters. In an ensemble of co-leads, the expert actors included Cameron Bajraktarevic-Hayward, Kaya Byrne, Jack Green, Sean van Doornum, Katrina Retallick and Rupert Reid. Special mentions must go to Deirdre Khoo, who maximises the minor role of Lucy most entertainingly, and Genevieve Goldman (Margo), who has an ideal voice for the material, and who, upon learning that her love interest, Billy, is being published by Alice\u2019s magazine, performs a little dance of exquisite ecstasy.\n\nThe lively choreography by Shannon Burns dovetails with the whip-crack directing, including such joy as a door held up to be knocked on, which, upon being opened, magically becomes a dining table. Designer Isabel Hudson cunningly implied the prevailing rusticity while accommodating 16 performers on the tight stage. Yes, the melodrama undid certain moments, and the redemptive storyline was predictable, yet all was animated by the music\u2019s high energy under Steedman\u2019s direction and Victoria Falconer\u2019s onstage supervision. MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nHERE YOU COME AGAIN\n\nTheatre Royal, September 13\n\nUntil October 18\n\nReviewed by JOYCE MORGAN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 The towering blonde wigs, the eyelashes, the rhinestones. And that\u2019s just the drag queens in the front stalls.\n\nThis fanfest was always going to draw Dolly Parton\u2019s most flamboyant admirers. It\u2019s more tribute show than fully fledged musical, so don\u2019t look for insights into Dolly or even much about the life of the fiercely talented singer/songwriter, Tennessee-born musician. Tricia Paoluccio delivers an impeccable, sparkly Dolly. Credit: Cameron Grant Fortunately, the star of this show delivers an impeccable, sparkly Dolly. Tricia Paoluccio captures Dolly\u2019s clear, bright voice, southern drawl and warm-hearted spirit. Whether acting lines or singing from the extensive Parton songbook, Paoluccio channels her idol. Threaded through this jukebox musical is a slender story about Dolly-tragic Kevin.\n\nSet amid the COVID pandemic, the 40-year-old has moved into his parents\u2019 attic. Kevin\u2019s career is on the skids, and his boyfriend has dumped him. Surrounded by stockpiled toilet rolls (remember that pandemic phenomenon?), Kevin is hoofing into the booze and Cheezels. \u201cWhat would Dolly do?\u201d he wonders. And, hey presto, she materialises \u2013 a vision in a pink frock and rhinestones. This is Dolly as fairy godmother. She\u2019s come to set Kevin\u2019s world to rights, help him restore his confidence and impart some homespun wisdom. What follows is a string of Parton numbers, her big hits \u2013 Here You Come Again, Jolene, Islands in the Stream, I Will Always Love You \u2013 and some lesser-known. These were well delivered, if not well integrated into the story. Taking a musical icon and spinning a tale around that figure can work brilliantly, as Titanique showed with its conceit that Celine Dion was on the doomed ship. But to succeed, the writing needs to be sharp and the story fleshed out.\n\nHere, the sections between the music sagged, especially in the first half as Kevin wallowed endlessly in his misery. As Kevin whined and Dolly retorted with more homespun wisdom than a crate of Hallmark greetings cards, by interval the repetition was deflating. The stronger second half kicked off with Nine to Five, which literally raised the tempo. Dolly\u2019s trademark wit was also more evident, as she poked fun at country and western songs replete with dead dogs and tragic romances. The Queen of Country, now on the cusp of 80, gave her blessing to this musical, first staged in the US in 2022. Co-created by Paoluccio, Gabriel Barre (who also directs) and Bruce Vilanch, it\u2019s been lightly adapted for an Australian audience by Fiona Harris and Mike McLeish, with Kevin\u2019s attic set in Bendigo. Dash Kruck was an overwrought Kevin but dialled back the shrillness later in the show. Vocally, he was well-paired with Paoluccio. The seven-piece band under Andrew Worboys\u2019 musical direction was tight as they moved around and above Paul Wills\u2019 attic set. Several of the musicians also played minor roles.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Former radio journalist Jason Smith documents Sydney homes slated for destruction to make way for townhouses, apartments or larger homes on his popular Instagram account, 1000housedrawings. Bulldozing character-filled federation, art deco and mid-century homes to make way for big boxy houses or uninspiring townhouses that don\u2019t add amenity, density or quality of housing infuriates him. \u201cI\u2019ll document all the ones I can. I\u2019ll save them in my own way with pencil and pen,\u201d said Smith, an architectural artist, of the homes he draws. Smith says he is neither a NIMBY nor a YIMBY, but a QIMBY \u2013 a proponent of quality in my backyard and not just development for its own sake. He would like to see more initiatives to adapt existing housing, partly because of the embedded carbon, but also to preserve well-built homes with decorative details that are likely to be replaced by uninspiring townhouses and units. Jason Smith has been drawing and photographing houses slated for demolition to document Sydney\u2019s architectural history. Credit: Janie Barrett Single house demolitions across Sydney\u2019s inner and middle-ring areas, including Kensington, Denistone, Arncliffe, North Sydney, Padstow and Camperdown, mostly ended in newer and bigger homes being built on the same site, new Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows. Despite a rebuild rate of 2.1 new homes for each house demolished across the state, more than 80 per cent of knockdowns in 40 well-located or affluent Sydney suburbs \u2013 close to transport and amenities \u2013 were replaced by enlarged or upgraded houses. Across NSW, 77,279 dwellings were approved to be flattened and rebuilt into housing over the five years to June 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anticipated destruction of more homes as part of the NSW government\u2019s multi-faceted plans to increase supply and density has historians, architects and others pushing to document these soon-to-be-bulldozed buildings and streetscapes before they disappear. Dr Jennifer Preston, chair of the Australian Institute of Architects heritage committee in NSW, said with the \u201csignificant changes\u201d the planned transport-oriented development proposals would bring to the city, \u201cperhaps we should again look at formally documenting the sites and streetscapes of buildings planned for demolition\u201d. The ABS noted in its August report: \u201cMost knock-down rebuilds are not adding to overall housing stock, but instead are used as a means of significantly upgrading an existing detached dwelling.\u201d Smith is inspired by the artist Joseph Fowles, whose book of drawings, Sydney in 184,8 was designed to depict the city as it truly was, rather than as the English imagined it. The Herald interviewed Smith on the footpath outside two charming century-old full-brick bungalows in Wahroonga, which he drew for his Instagram account. They were \u201coff to the tip\u201d to make way for \u201cuninspiring townhouses\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith says he is not anti-development. \u201cWe have to have development. I\u2019m not silly or stupid enough to think that we\u2019re going to save every single house,\u201d Smith said. It is an impossible task to record every home being demolished, nor does anyone think it is warranted. An average of 16,753 dwellings got demolition approval and were rebuilt each year from 2019-20 to 2024-25. Despite the government\u2019s push for increased density, 58 per cent of knockdown rebuilds nationwide were replaced by another detached single dwelling. In NSW, that figure was 54.8 per cent. In the late 19th century, the City of Sydney\u2019s City Surveyor took advantage of the camera, then a new technology, to document homes threatened with demolition. This resulted in the Demolition Books, containing 5000 photographs and glass plate negatives \u2013 not all the homes were knocked down, some were only threatened. City historian Laila Ellmoos said from 1879 the council had the power to demolish any ruinous building by issuing the owner a condemnation notice to compel either a repair or demolition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorian Laila Ellmoos looks at one of the glass plate negatives uncovered by the City of Sydney archives team. Credit: Kate Geraghty Photos documenting this process are now a rich record of the city\u2019s social history. \u201cA hundred years later, you can say, thanks for that. Now I can see how Sydneysiders lived 100 years ago,\u201d Ellmoos said. \u201cWhat you see in those photographs [of Sydney] is poverty. It\u2019s not a wealthy city at that time, people are really struggling.\u201d The photos showed children in bare feet and women picking through abandoned sites for building materials. \u201cThen you can see all the building materials, which were recycled.\u201d Smith said the great value of the demolition books was that they document what was lost. \u201cSydney has always had a short-sighted love affair with demolition; only for the next generation to despair at what is gone. We can look up with envy at the Queen Victoria Building today \u2013 three times slated for demolition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "These are the areas involved in learning and emotion: the olfactory or piriform cortex, which identifies smells; the amygdala, which is involved in generating emotions; and the hippocampus, which stores and organises memories. If the hippocampus thinks the smell is important or connected with a particularly emotional moment, it can \u201cfile\u201d the information and store it indefinitely. Smith began his academic career in philosophy, studying the area of mind and perception. After a stint as a wine columnist, he founded the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London\u2019s School of Advanced Study in 2011, alongside eminent neuroscientists such as the late Professor Colin Blakemore. Their brief was to study multisensory perception. The idea is that our senses don\u2019t just exist in isolation, but that they inform one another. \u201cWe don\u2019t just hear or see \u2013 everything is interconnected,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThe most multisensory experience is tasting, and most of tasting is due to smell. It\u2019s the combination of the two that creates flavour.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the rest of the world sat up and started to take notice. \u201cMainstream science didn\u2019t pay much attention until COVID,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut when anosmia emerged as one of the symptoms, online searches spiked.\u201d In the past few years, more evidence has appeared to suggest that anosmia is a symptom of serious illness or injury.\n\nLoss of smell was a common and distinct symptom of COVID with up to 60 per cent of sufferers experiencing it. Credit: iStock \u201cYou can lose your sense of smell after a head injury, when nerves to the brain are severed,\u201d says Smith. \u201cSinusitis, or a virus, can also cause anosmia. If there is no discernible cause, we call it \u2018idiopathic\u2019 anosmia. Research has shown that a gradual loss of smell can be a two-year advance warning of conditions such as dementia or Parkinson\u2019s. It may even give clues as far as 12 years in advance.\u201d Researchers have been working on this area for a while. In a 2014 study held in Leipzig, Germany, 7000 participants were given tests on their sensitivity to different smells, their capacity to distinguish between them, and their mental abilities. Those who had the keenest sense of smell also did better on the cognitive tests. Conversely, the weaker their \u201cnose\u201d, the worse they scored in verbal fluency, memorisation and attention span. A 2021 study at San Diego State University in California found that people\u2019s performance on odour sensitivity tests appeared to predict who would go on to develop mild cognitive impairment and who would develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These tests were seen to be a better predictor of the condition\u2019s progression than the mental state examination used by GPs and neurologists. Scientists are also finding links between olfactory dysfunction and depression. A 2022 study by the Dresden University of Technology in Germany found a correlation between patients\u2019 olfactory ability and symptoms of depressive illness: when their olfactory function improved, so did their mood.\n\nBrain scans seem to agree: olfactory dysfunction is accompanied by loss of grey matter, and a shrinking of the hippocampus. Such changes may explain both the cognitive decline and the rising depression in people with dementia: \u201cSmell loss interferes with the affective and emotion control systems,\u201d says Professor Thomas Hummel of Dresden University, one of the leading experts in this area. Loading Hence, scientists believe olfactory testing could become more useful in early screening for cognitive impairment. \u201cAs the new dementia drugs rely on early intervention, this could be important,\u201d says Smith. If we know that losing your sense of smell is a sign of serious illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can we reverse the equation and train our senses to slow down or even ward off dementia? For now, to claim this would be a stretch, though those working in the field are optimistic that it may one day be shown to be the case. There is more consensus around the theory that realising that paying attention to your sense of smell \u2013 \u201ctraining it,\u201d as it were \u2013 can add to a person\u2019s enjoyment of life, and perhaps enhance their cognitive skills.\n\nSmith is convinced of this, pointing to a number of studies showing that smell training can keep you cognitively more active. \u201cOne study followed people in their 70s, some who did Sudoku, and others who did daily smell training for three months,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ones who did Sudoku just got better at Sudoku. But the ones who did smell training had better recall.\u201d It\u2019s important to point out that these studies are correlative \u2013 as in, no \u201ccause and effect\u201d between smell and a sharper brain has been proved. But Smith feels this does not detract from the validity of their outcomes. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of use it or lose it,\u201d he says. \u201cUnlike your hearing and vision, your sense of smell is underused. This is also in contrast to other animals. Therefore we have spare capacity. There was even a study published in 2016 in the Frontiers of Neuroscience suggesting that perfumers and wine experts have more grey matter than people in other occupations.\u201d As scientists debate the potential of using smell in a clinical setting, Smith remains a flag-bearer for the use of aromas to boost your wellbeing and stimulate your brain. \u201cSmell is bound up with memory, emotion and arousal,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you lose arousal, your emotions are flattened and the world becomes dull and grey.\u201d Can you train your smell for a smarter brain? What is smell training?\n\nIn 2009, Dresden University\u2019s Hummel ran a study to investigate whether repeated short-term exposure to odours over a period of three months would have any effect on the olfactory ability of a group of anosmia sufferers. One group of volunteers was given four essential oils \u2013 and told to sniff each one every day, morning and evening, for 10 seconds at a time over a period of 12 weeks. The other was not. Loading At the end of 12 weeks, researchers found that 30 per cent of the patients who had sniffed the oils had had an improvement in olfactory function, compared with the group who didn\u2019t participate. \u201cSmell training definitely won\u2019t harm and it might help,\u201d says Smith. What were the essential oils in the trial?",
