        "text": "Melbourne's Metro Tunnel has opened to passengers this morning, albeit with some minor hiccups.\n\nThe project, which cost $15 billion and has been hampered by delays and setbacks, added five new stations, with the first trains hitting the rails just after 9am.\n\nMelburnians have flocked to try out the extension with massive crowds at all stations, though some delays and minor issues have been experienced.\n\nMelburnians flocked to the newly opened Melbourne Metro Tunnel today. (Simon Schluter)\n\nThere were delays of up to 15 minutes after a fire alarm went off near Anzac Station, forcing trains\ufeff to remain idle, though those delays are clearing according to Metro Trains' official website.\n\nThere has also been escalator outages at Parkville Station and State Library Station, according to The Age.\n\nThe other new stations opening today are Town Hall and Arden, with the new line running for almost 100 kilometres.\n\nIt represents the biggest upgrade to Melbourne's rail in 40 years, doubling the size of the city's underground rail network and will ease congestion on the city loop.\n\nIt is a project that has been years in the making, with tunnelling beginning in 2019.\n\nPassengers at ANZAC station after arriving on the first train to go through the newly opened Metro Tunnel. (Chris Hopkins)\n\nBoring machines were digging as deep as 40 metres underneath Melbourne to create the tunnels, the most striking of which are two twin tunnels that run for nine kilometres.\n\nThe opening is not without controversy, with the firefighters union wanting to delay it due to claims about dangerous radio faults within the new network.\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan claimed it was a scare tactic to try and secure better pay, rather than publicising any actual safety concerns.\n\n\"The claims that have been made by the union today are wrong and they've also been clearly rejected by the rail safety regulator, who is the expert on this matter,\" Allan said.\n\n\"These claims are being made perhaps more for industrial purposes than anything else.\"",

        "text": "ChatGPT is about to get a lot hornier. Sam Altman, chief executive of the artificial intelligence chatbot's parent company, says it's about allowing adults more freedom to use AI how they want.\n\nBut experts from a range of fields, including OpenAI's own wellbeing panel, have raised a range of concerns about what it will mean for mental health and child safety.\n\nChatGPT is set to enable \"erotica for verified adults\" next month but there are still plenty of questions about what exactly that means and what the consequences might be.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, takes his seat before a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, September 4, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWhat is 'erotic mode'?\n\nIt's not clear exactly what OpenAI is planning here. Altman said it would be rolling out age restrictions to allow the ChatGPT to do \"even more, like erotica for verified adults\".\n\nHe pitched it less as a specific \"erotic mode\" than as a way of granting more freedom in the company's \"treat adult users like adults\" principle.\n\nThat leaves the door open for a lot of possibilities. It's not known if the changes will allow the model to write erotic fiction, engage in back-and-forth sexual conversations or even create an entire persona users could effectively \"sext\" with.\n\nOpenAI didn't respond to questions about what the changes would be like beyond referring to Altman's X posts announcing the feature and stressing the importance of teen wellbeing.\n\nAltman says it's all about allowing users more freedom. (AP)\n\nWhy the change?\n\nPut simply, people want it. A 2024 Washington Post analysis of almost 200,000 English-language conversations with AI chatbots found more than 7 per cent of conversations were about sex.\n\nA Harvard Business Review piece from April this year analysing Reddit posts and online articles didn't specifically delve into erotic but found therapy and companionship \u2013 \"ongoing social and emotional connection, sometimes with a romantic dimension\" \u2013 was the number one use case for generative AI.\n\nAltman says it's all about allowing users more freedom.\n\nSenior lecturer in Computing and \u200bInformation at Cardiff Metropolitan University Simon Thorne suggests there's another motive: profit.\n\n\"This is a significant departure from what they have been doing, which is mostly attempting to keep what they might view as harmful information away from the user,\" he tells 9news.com.au\n\n\"Whether it's about erotic or of a sexual nature, or whether it's making a pipe bomb, or whatever it might be, there's obvious, obvious things that you don't necessarily want your platform to be responsible for providing.\n\n\"So this is obviously a big change. I would suggest that, you know, this is because they are losing huge amounts of money.\"\n\nThere's always been a market for erotica, in many forms. (Nick Miller)\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nTech figures, mental health experts, a former OpenAI product safety lead and a member of the company's \"Expert Council on Well-Being and AI\" have all raised concerns about the announcement.\n\nThey range from difficulties keeping children away to worries about mental health \u2013 already a concern for heavy users without introducing erotica \u2013 and driving users towards increasingly extreme sexual fantasies.\n\nAI researcher Steven Adler, who led product safety at OpenAI, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times saying he didn't trust his former boss Altman's claims the company had \"been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues\" and relax restrictions.\n\n\"If the company really has strong reason to believe it's ready to bring back erotica on its platforms, it should show its work,\" he said, pointing to a lawsuit claiming ChatGPT helped a 16-year-old boy suicide.\n\n\"AI is increasingly becoming a dominant part of our lives, and so are the technology's risks that threaten users' lives.\"\n\nProfessor Munmun De Choudhury, a computer scientist who's been exploring how generative AI and other emerging technologies transform how people connect online, is a member of OpenAI's Expert Council on Well-Being and AI.\n\nShe tells 9news.com.au she hadn't been consulted on the erotica rollout, which was announced the day after the council.\n\nShe says Altman's claims about mitigating mental health concerns lacked transparency and independent evidence.\n\n\"Mental health vulnerabilities in AI interactions are not issues that can be fully 'mitigated' through technical fixes alone \u2013 they require ongoing oversight, transparency, and validation by experts in psychology and digital safety,\" she says.\n\nA member of OpenAI's Expert Council on Well-Being and AI said she wasn't consulted on the changes. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWon't somebody please think of the children?\n\nOpenAI stresses this feature will only be for adults, saying it's building an age prediction system to understand whether someone is under 18 or not.\n\nIt says if the system is unsure, it will default back to the under-18 experience and give adults other ways to prove their age.\n\nBut there are major concerns with the effectiveness of existing age-gating and age-prediction tech and OpenAI's version hasn't been seen publicly.\n\nThorne says the recent introduction of the Online Safety Act in the UK, which imposes similar restrictions on a range of sites, shows how easily the systems can be fooled, sometimes with something as simple as a printed photo of an older person.\n\n\"Do I think they care? Not particularly, no,\" he says.\n\n\"They're going to, I think, say, 'Look, we've done our bit. We've put the kind of age control up front.\n\n\"Unless somebody makes them care.\"\n\nDe Choudhury says robust age verification and clear opt-in consent are among several \"non-negotiable guardrails\" OpenAI must implement.\n\nOpenAI stresses this feature will only be for adults. (Graphic: Polly Hanning)\n\nAre there concerns for adults?\n\nEven if OpenAI manages to block children, there are worries about what the widespread availability of AI-generated erotica on tap could mean for consenting adults too.\n\nIn a world of essentially unlimited internet pornography \u2013 and associated addiction risks \u2013 on the surface it's hard to make an argument that allowing people to use a chatbot for erotica could pose much of a problem.\n\nBut Thorne and De Choudhury both raise concerns with the interactivity of AI systems and their capacity for reinforcing or heightening ideas.\n\nThorne says while pornography or human-designed erotic literature is relatively \"static\", a chatbot is \"very specific to the individual\".\n\nDe Choudhury says allowing erotic interactions with chatbots risks deepening parasocial or dependency-based \"relationships\" that already pose mental health concerns.\n\n\"When intimacy and sexual expression are introduced, users may form stronger emotional attachments to an entity that cannot reciprocate or maintain boundaries in human terms,\" she says.\n\n\"This can distort expectations of real relationships, exacerbate loneliness, and even discourage people from seeking human connection or professional help.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence, AI technology, business people use intelligent technology, Ai, artificial intelligence by entering commands to create something, future technology change, chat bot with AI. (Getty)\n\nWhat happens if my naughty chat leaks?\n\nPrivacy is another huge issue. Thorne says the change will give OpenAI a \"very detailed data set, probably the likes of which have never been seen before\".\n\n\"If that information gets into the wrong hands, you know it could be extremely damaging to people, and also, you know it can be exploited to target people even more individually.\n\nDe Choudhury says strong data privacy and non-retention policies must govern all sexual or intimate exchanges to prevent misuse or leaks.\n\nHow does OpenAI say it's safe?\n\nAltman insists the planned change is safe and characterises it as just one aspect of increased freedom he wants to give users, saying \"allowing a lot of freedom for people to use AI in the ways that they want is an important part of our mission\".\n\n\"We are making a decision to prioritise safety over privacy and freedom for teenagers. And we are not loosening any policies related to mental health,\" he posted to X in October.\n\n\"This is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection.\"\n\nHe insists nothing that causes harm to others will be allowed and that ChatGPT will be able to behave differently for users experiencing \"mental health crises\".\n\n\"Without being paternalistic we will attempt to help users achieve their long-term goals,\" he said. \"But we are not the elected moral police of the world. In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here.\"\n\nOpenAI says teen wellbeing is a top priority.\n\n\"We have safeguards in place today, such as surfacing crisis hotlines, guiding how our models respond to sensitive requests, and nudging for breaks during long sessions, and we're continuing to strengthen them,\" a spokesperson tells 9news.com.au.\n\n\"We recently rolled out parental controls , developed with expert input, so families can decide what works best in their homes, and we're building toward a long-term age-prediction system to help tailor experiences appropriately.\"\n\nAltman insists the planned change is safe and characterises it as just one aspect of increased freedom he wants to give users. (Getty)\n\nHas this been done before?\n\nThere are a slew of AI companies offering erotica and erotic functions in everything from text-based stories and personas to images and video, and there are widespread reports among users that ChatGPT would generate erotica with minimal effort as recently as this year.\n\nMy Spicy Vanilla founder Andrei Tolocica says his platform started by generating date night ideas before pivoting to AI erotica, and now counts about 60,000 monthly users, including couples therapists.\n\n\"Women love reading erotica, but now also men start to read erotica,\" he tells 9news.com.au.\n\n\"And this is something nice that is happening, and people are getting used to it, because they understand that porn can be damaging for them and when we're speaking about erotica, it's just in your imagination, like you can be getting into it smoother, and it's not that aggressive on your mind.\n\n\"And plus, when they are generating custom erotica with their partner, it's again, like, strengthens their relationship.\"",

(Supplied: Gold Coast City Council)\n\nHe said the dredge had deliberately formed the island off the city's northern beach strip most impacted by the storm.\n\nMr Salyer said tides, swell and the area's natural sand movement would push the sand where it needs to go.\n\n\"It's very much been put there on purpose, which is what nature would do anyway, but we're just exaggerating that process by doing it mechanically,\" he said.\n\n\"It'll start to dissipate over the Christmas season and eventually wash its way in.\"\n\nSpeeding up natural flow\n\nMr Salyer says the technique is used to help speed up the process of replenishing the city's beaches.

        "text": "Last week's inflation data showed electricity prices have jumped by 37 per cent in the past year.\n\nIt sparked more talk of the cost of living, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers leaving the door open for a possible extension to the federal government's electricity rebate scheme into 2026.\n\nWhy is the electricity market on Australia's east coast so dysfunctional?\n\nThere have been two episodes in modern history where Australia has connected a domestic energy market to the global market before, and we've then been hit by a global energy shock, which made inflation in Australia worse.\n\nWe're currently dealing with one of them.\n\nCrude oil in the 1970s\n\nOne episode occurred in the 1970s.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Australia was producing much of its own oil for domestic consumption.\n\nIt meant Australian motorists were partly shielded from global fluctuations in the price of crude oil.\n\nIs there something rotten in Australia's fuel market? Industry experts say there is no excuse for wild variations in fuel prices across Australia, as calls grow for an independent investigation into the disparity.\n\nBut in late 1978, the Coalition government of Malcolm Fraser introduced a new fuel tax, with a plan announced by his young treasurer John Howard.\n\nAt the time, Australia was producing roughly 70 per cent of its domestic oil needs, and the maximum allowable retail price for premium petrol in Sydney was 21 cents per litre.\n\nBut Mr Howard said Australian motorists were getting petrol too cheaply.\n\nHe announced a plan that all Australian-produced crude oil would be required to start being sold to local refineries at the same price as it cost to import crude oil from overseas.\n\nIt meant Australians would have to start paying prices based on world oil prices; they'd no longer be able to enjoy cheap oil from their own domestic supply.\n\nAnd he justified his plan partly on ecological reasons.\n\n\"Since the OPEC countries quadrupled the world price of crude oil in 1973-74, Australians have continued to enjoy artificially low prices for crude oil,\" he told parliament. \"While the rest of the world was facing up to the inescapable fact that the days of cheap energy were over, Australians \u2014 even after the imposition in the 1975-76 budget of a $2 per barrel production levy \u2014 were continuing to pay less than half of the world price for Australian-produced crude oil. \"Subsidised indigenous oil prices encouraged a wasteful use of a key energy resource and inhibited the adoption of more energy-efficient processes and technologies. \"In recognition of this the government moved last year towards a more realistic pricing policy for Australian-produced crude oil,\" he said.\n\nMr Howard said his \"import parity pricing\" regime would increase the production levy on oil produced in the Bass Strait from less than $3 per barrel to the \"world price\" of $10.26 per barrel.\n\nHe estimated it would see petrol prices rise by 3.5 cents a litre initially. Given the maximum retail price for petrol in Sydney was 21 cents a litre, it represented an increase of 16.6 per cent.\n\nIt was a historic policy shift.\n\nFrom that moment, Australia would connect its petrol prices to the global price of crude oil, putting Australian motorists and consumers more at the mercy of international markets.\n\nAnd it happened just before the 1979 oil crisis.\n\nIn the aftermath of that oil crisis, Australia's domestic fuel prices would jump by nearly 50 per cent, which fed into the destructive inflation Australia experienced in the early 1980s.\n\nLiquefied natural gas in the 2020s\n\nThe second episode occurred more recently.\n\nSince 2015, when the Gladstone LNG terminal was opened in Queensland, gas has been a major export industry for eastern Australia.\n\nAustralia's energy costs have tripled and manufacturers are hurting Australia has a wealth of coal and gas resources as well as renewable energy, so why are energy costs so high \u2014 especially for manufacturers?\n\nIt's had a major impact on energy prices (and inflation) in ways most Australians still don't understand.\n\nAs the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) explained in 2021, demand for gas on Australia's east coast historically derived from three main domestic sources \u2013 commercial and industrial (C&I) gas users, gas-powered generators, and residential customers.\n\nBut with the launch of LNG exports in 2015, international customers became a new source of demand, competing to buy eastern Australian gas.\n\nIt has transformed Australia's eastern gas market by giving producers the choice of exporting gas or selling it domestically:\n\n\"By 2018, over 60 per cent of eastern Australian gas production was being exported,\" the AER said. \"With domestic users now competing with overseas customers to buy Australian gas, prices in the domestic market have shifted to align more closely with international gas prices. \"Shifting gas prices also impact electricity markets, which rely on gas powered generation to firm output from weather-dependent renewable generation and at times of peak electricity demand.\"\n\nBy early 2021, the AER said so much gas was being exported from Australia's east coast that five LNG import terminals were under consideration in NSW, Victoria, and South Australia to solve a forecast domestic gas shortfall in Australia's southern states.\n\nIn 2023, China was the primary market for eastern Australian LNG, accounting for 59 per cent of exports (733 PJ). (Source: Australian Energy Regulator, State of the Energy Market 2024, page. 165)\n\nSince gas prices on the east coast have become \"aligned\" to the world price for gas, we've been more at the mercy of global energy supply shocks.\n\nAnd a big shock came in 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt contributed to Australian domestic gas prices hitting record high levels in 2022, which fed into Australia's surge in inflation in 2022 and 2023.\n\nBruce Robertson, a former stockbroker and fund manager who is now an independent energy consultant, told the ABC earlier this year that gas exporters were also responsible for high gas and electricity prices in Australia.\n\nGas giant Australia on cusp of importing supplies Australia is one of the world's biggest gas exporters, but we're about to start importing it from overseas.\n\nHe said the price set for gas on Australia's east coast sets the benchmark for electricity prices in the wholesale market, which is where manufacturers buy their gas, and it was \"obscenely expensive\".\n\n\"Exxon, Woodside, Origin Energy, ConocoPhillips, and the Australian company Santos \u2014 they control the market and set the price for gas,\" he said.\n\n\"Prior to [gas exporting from] 2015, gas and electricity was affordable. But since the gas cartel has been operating we've seen prices go through the roof.\"\n\nIn September this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that despite recent government efforts to force those gas producers to supply more gas to Australia's domestic market, the situation still hasn't improved.\n\n\"Upstream markets are uncompetitive and remain dominated by the Queensland LNG producers and their associates, who influence over 90 per cent of east coast reserves,\" it said. \"The lack of effective upstream competition is contributing to the imbalance in bargaining power faced by gas buyers and their difficulties securing gas on acceptable terms.\"\n\nWhen is the next global energy shock coming?\n\nIf Australia ever gets to the point where it can produce 100 per cent of its energy from renewable sources, will it avoid those types of global energy shocks in the future?\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a future where the phrase \"global energy shock\" falls out of use and becomes redundant when enough countries can produce their own energy from domestic renewable sources.\n\nThat scenario would also help the Reserve Bank to control inflation.\n\nAre inflation-targeting central banks ready for the 'new inflation'? IMF economists say inflation-targeting central banks did not achieve better outcomes than others following the 2022 surge.\n\nTwo economists from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently pointed out that the 2022 inflation surge, which was partly driven by skyrocketing energy prices, created a real-life experiment to test which countries managed inflation better during a global and synchronised supply shock.\n\nAnd surprisingly, they found there was \"no systematic evidence\" that inflation-targeting countries, such as Australia, were any better at insulating their economies from global price pressures in recent years than countries that didn't practice inflation targeting.\n\nThey said their finding was significant.\n\nThey said for the past 40 years, inflation has been understood as a predominantly demand-driven phenomenon, and macro-economic models have been operating on the premise that inflationary pressures can be effectively contained through aggregate demand management (shifting interest rates up and down).\n\nBut if supply-side driven inflation becomes more persistent in the future, it's going to challenge contemporary inflation-targeting frameworks, they said.\n\n\"[And] we are entering a period marked by sustained and overlapping supply disruptions, many of which are structural and slow moving,\" they warned.\n\nSo, if Australia does eventually produce 100 per cent of its energy from renewable sources (it will be a long and expensive journey to get there), you'd think it would reduce the risk of Australia being caught up in future global energy shocks.\n\nPreventing cartels from controlling future energy supplies would also be beneficial.\n\nBoth of those things would help to reduce the cost of living.",

        "text": "West Australian lawyers say their own regulator is causing them psychological harm, and in some cases destroying their lives, in a scathing rebuke of the watchdog tasked with keeping the industry on track.\n\nFive peak legal bodies in WA say they are not being properly regulated by the state's Legal Practice Board, which decides who is allowed to practice law and handles complaints about lawyers' conduct.\n\nTheir concerns led to a parliamentary inquiry into the board and its role in regulating the profession.\n\nWA's legal watchdog faces parliamentary inquiry The tables will be turned on the Legal Practice Board of WA as it faces a parliamentary inquiry amid a \"detailed list\" of complaints.\n\nIn a stunning joint submission to that inquiry published on Friday, the group called for \"urgent action\" to address what they describe as \"an unprecedented loss of confidence\" in the board.\n\n\"When regulation presents a barrier to efficient and effective practice, access to justice is impaired, and trust and confidence in the system breaks down,\" they wrote.\n\nTheir submission, which stretches for hundreds of pages and includes dozens of case studies, describes \"chronic delays\" across much of the board's work, \"inappropriate and highly damaging investigation and prosecution processes\" and a \"failure to engage, communicate and respond to enquiries and applications\".\n\nFor its part, the board has acknowledged there had been \"operational shortcomings\" in the past but said \"significant progress has been made\" in recent years.\n\n'Lives are being destroyed'\n\nThe peak bodies' most strident criticisms were reserved for the board's approach to investigating and disciplining lawyers accused of falling short of the high standards to which they are held, which it said was \"actively causing considerable harm\".\n\nThe submission to the inquiry came from five WA legal bodies. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThe group described an \"overly aggressive, persecutorial and punitive\" approach by the board, including suspending practitioners without a hearing or any misconduct finding, and \"expanding and escalating\" complaints.\n\n\"We are told this is causing damage and psychological injury to members of the profession,\" the group wrote.\n\n\"This reported damage ranges from exacerbating already high stress levels and mental health issues, to directly causing anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe Association of Corporate Counsel Australia, Community Legal WA, The Law Society of WA, The Piddington Society and Women Lawyers Western Australia have made a joint submission to the parliamentary inquiry. (ABC News: Demi Lynch)\n\n\" At the worst end of the spectrum of the information we have been provided with, careers and practitioners' lives are being destroyed. \"\n\nThe submission relays complaints from Law Society members that the board lacked procedural fairness, and in some instances communicated in a way that was \"unprofessional, discourteous or overly aggressive\".\n\n'No utility in being nice'\n\nThe board's response was submitted the same day as the peak bodies', and so could not directly address the issues raised, but it did argue that its performance \"ought not be measured by the feedback of those who feel aggrieved\" but by \"overall regulatory outcomes\".\n\n\"Isolated events or anecdotes of practitioner dissatisfaction are not grounds for structural reform,\" its submission reads.\n\n\"The legal profession requires a regulator that is independent, firm, proportionate and mindful of impacts on all parties, but with the overarching public interest at the heart of its purpose and execution.\"\n\nThe Legal Practice Board has acknowledged some \"shortcomings\" but says structural reform is unnecessary. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd)\n\nBut the board did acknowledge that it \"needs to be aware that human beings are impacted by its decisions\".\n\n\"It should be appropriately responsive and accessible but there is no utility in being 'nice',\" the submission reads.\n\nTo improve its performance, it had increased its Investigation and Legal team and was continuing recruitment, and efforts included \"providing communication training for staff\".\n\n'Ghost organisation'\n\nThe organisations also complained about the board's lack of communication and long delays in making decisions \u2014 with one survey respondent describing it as a \"ghost organisation\".\n\nLawyers also reported having to follow up with the board multiple times to receive a response, with repeated phone calls and emails often not responded to.\n\nA recently-admitted solicitor was recorded as telling a survey: \"If legal practitioners were to treat corresponding with clients in the way the [board] does, the [board] would admonish their behaviour.\"\n\nLawyers have complained the Legal Practice Board lacks procedural fairness and has caused considereable distress to many. (Lexrvulescu / Getty Images)\n\nThe submission also included reports of documents containing personal information being sent to the wrong lawyer, and lawyers having to prove they had paid board fees.\n\nThe board acknowledged its emails accounts \"were not consistently monitored, resulting in backlogs, lost emails, delayed responses and inconsistent inbox management across teams\", but said a new system had since been implemented.\n\nIt would also soon expand its phone lines from two to 20, and said renewals for lawyers' practising certificates were being issued faster this year than last year.\n\nHacker problem\n\nThe board was hacked in May, with 6,000 people notified their data may have been stolen, which the board said caused delays.\n\nBut all submissions wanted the legal industry to continue to self-regulate, rather than handing that power to outsiders.\n\nIts most recent annual report showed the board had more than $12.5 million in financial reserves in June 2024, up from $11 million in June 2023.\n\nThe Legal Practice Board was hacked earlier this year. (ABC News: Jessica Black)\n\nThat led the Law Society to question whether lawyers who paid fees were getting value for money.\n\n\"Since the board's income is derived from mandatory levies on the legal profession, the profession has the right to understand why the board believes this is a proper use of money,\" it wrote.\n\nThe issue was not addressed in the board's submission, but in an earlier annual report it noted the requirement for \"financial stability\" to ensure it could meet its purpose of regulating the legal profession.",

(ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nFor many years, specialist GPs in Queensland have been able to diagnose ADHD in children aged four to 17-years-old. They will not be required to undertake specific training once that expands to include adults.\n\nA specialist GP is a doctor who has completed three years of supervised training in a GP setting and has passed exams in an accredited general practice training program.\n\nHowever, the absence of specific training has raised concerns for some health professionals.\n\nReforms to remove 'red tape'\n\nBrisbane-based GP Dr Aaron Chambers said the changes would make it easier for children who have a diagnosis and treatment plan once they turn 18.\n\nThis is because they will no longer need to be referred back to a psychiatrist and seek regulatory approval to continue their treatment.\n\n\"It is great news for patients and it is really going to massively remove red tape and regulatory road blocks so they can get access to the care they need,\" he said.\n\nDr Aaron Chambers says GPs will take several steps, which could include referring a patient to a psychologist and psychiatrist. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nHowever, Dr Chambers, who is the chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Queensland eduction committee, said it would not mean that \"you are going to be able to call up your GP and they will just prescribe you medication\".\n\n\"If you are curious as to whether you've got ADHD, and you want to get an assessment, that is a much deeper discussion,\" he said.\n\nDr Chambers said several steps would be taken, which could include seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist.\n\n\"It depends on the complexity of the condition and the skills of the GP as to whether they take over the entire management of that or they work in collaboration with a specialist colleague,\" he said.\n\n\" GPs are very good at knowing where their own personal scope of practice lies, and they work collaboratively with colleagues. \"\n\nHe said despite there not being a specific training requirement as part of the expanded remit, all GPs underwent annual professional development and were constantly updating their professional skills and knowledge.\n\n\"I think there are legitimate concerns around over diagnosis but GPs are experts in ... knowing when to get another specialist involved in order to validate a diagnosis,\" he said.\n\nPeak body calls for monitoring of ADHD diagnoses, prescribing trends As ADHD diagnoses rise, Australia's peak body for psychiatrists is calling for a national system to monitor and stop potential over-diagnosis of the condition.\n\nDifferent levels of training required\n\nAt a meeting in September, the country's health ministers endorsed the need for a national approach to ADHD diagnosis and prescribing practices, but currently each state and territory is taking different steps.\n\nLast week, the NSW government said more than 2,900 patients with an existing diagnosis had filled scripts through a trained GP after changes came into effect in September.\n\nTraining programs for GPs are being rolled out in Western Australia and South Australia in diagnosing and initiating treatment, while the ACT opened expressions of interest earlier this year for a pilot program.\n\nAustralasian ADHD Professionals Association president and psychiatrist David Coghill said he was \"very disappointed\" that in Queensland the changes would not coincide with rolling out specific training.\n\n\"Everybody who manages a new health condition needs to be able to be trained in assessing, diagnosing and managing and supporting people with that condition,\" he said.\n\n\"People often need other types of support, not medication support, but psychological and therapeutic support to help them manage.\"\n\nDavid Coghill says GPs will be able to provide good ongoing support for patients with ADHD once they are trained. (Supplied)\n\nProfessor Coghill said the rise in awareness of the condition had also come with \"social media pressure\" for people to consider whether ADHD was \"contributing to challenges that they have\".\n\n\"The task for people assessing ADHD is both to make sure that we recognise when someone does have ADHD \u2026 but also that we can recognise when someone's presenting with something they might think is ADHD but actually is better explained by other difficulties,\" he said.\n\nHe said once GPs were trained they would be able to provide good ongoing support for some cases and refer to specialists when needed.\n\n\"What's going to be important though is making the links between the GPs and the other specialists,\" Professor Coghill said.\n\nAustralian Psychological Society chief executive Dr Zena Burgess said while she welcomed the focus on improving support for patients, it was important the role psychologists played in the assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment of ADHD was not overlooked.\n\n\"We believe a collaborative model \u2014 where psychologists provide assessment, diagnosis and psychological treatment and GPs oversee medication \u2014 would provide a sustainable and effective solution,\" she said.\n\nDr Zena Burgess says the reforms risked overlooking the vital role psychologists could and should have in assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment. (Supplied: Australian Psychological Society)\n\nThe position of the Royal Australian College of Psychiatrists is that the expanded role of GPs in diagnosing ADHD in adults needed to come with mandatory accredited training and professional development.\n\nThe group said that comprehensive assessments must reflect the \"time and depth required\", which is often up to one to two hours.\n\n\"This depth of assessment is essential to avoid both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis, and ensures appropriate, safe, evidence-based treatments, including the safe prescribing of stimulant medication,\" their position statement read.\n\nDiagnosis 'life-changing'\n\nMs Mabbott's sister and business partner Angie Casella was formally diagnosed about 18 months ago and said it had been \"life-changing\".\n\n\"I feel like it helped me gain control of some of the things I had lost complete control of in my life,\" she said.\n\nIt was a long and costly process for Ms Casella, with appointments with various specialists taking about eight months and leaving her about $1,500 out of pocket.\n\nSisters Kaycee- Anne Mabbott and Angie Casella. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nShe said while she was supportive of the move to expand the remit of GPs, she was concerned that some patients may expect medication to be a quick fix.\n\n\"For me, I sought out a diagnosis because I had reached that crisis point, and I really felt like there was no other alternative other than to try medication,\" she said.",

She was 25 when she moved to Sydney in 1989.\n\n\" She was very cool, but she suffered no fools. \"\n\n\"She had really high standards about being a professional musician,\" Howell says.\n\nHowell first met Rutherford at the National Braille Music Camp, an annual week-long program where older blind musicians teach braille music and mentor school-aged students.\n\n\"Jann was a very accomplished classical pianist,\" Howell says.\n\n\"You can tell that her jazz compositions have roots in classical music.\"\n\nRutherford composed and arranged music with ease.\n\nHowell remembers the buzz she felt as a 16-year-old when Rutherford set one of her poems to music.\n\nRutherford was equally at home with classical music and jazz. (Supplied: Paul Cutlan)\n\n\"She liked the jazz lifestyle of coffee, alcohol and cigarettes, but she would also sing arias by J.S. Bach and Gabriel Faur\u00e9,\" Howell says.\n\nRutherford was a pioneer in using technology to compose.\n\nAs well as traditional cassette tapes, she used Cakewalk, an early digital music software to write down her compositions and arrangements.\n\n\"She would write out the music for her sighted peers,\" Howell says.\n\nThose peers include some of the leading jazz musicians in Australia, many of whom are still active today.\n\nThriving in Sydney's '90s jazz world\n\nOne of Rutherford's longtime friends and bandmates was bassist Craig Scott, Chair of the Jazz Studies Unit at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music from 2005 to 2016.\n\nScott played many of Rutherford's original compositions.\n\n\"Jann walked into a situation where there was quite a lot happening, particularly around the middle of the city,\" Scott says.\n\nJann Rutherford frequented Sydney's '90s jazz clubs, either performing or supporting friends. (Supplied: Paul Cutlan)\n\nSydney was home to several dedicated jazz clubs within walking distance of each other in the 1990s, according to Scott.\n\nRutherford frequently played at venues including the Strawberry Hills Hotel, the Side On Caf\u00e9, the Soup Jazz Club, the Basement and others.\n\nRutherford also undertook further studies at the Sydney Conservatorium, where her teachers included Mike Nock and Roger Frampton. She also met legendary pianist Judy Bailey.\n\n\"[Historically], the Con was regarded as being a boys club,\" Scott says. But Rutherford thrived.\n\n\"Jann was part of a [quintet] of young female players called Any Woman's Blues,\" Evans says.\n\nThe group, led by vocalist Kate Swadling, became one of Rutherford's sources for support.\n\nAt the time, Evans says, \"it was very common to be the only woman in a band.\"\n\nRutherford was also involved with several other leading Sydney-based bands.\n\nShe recorded the album Pentatonic in New York with the Graeme Norris Quintet in 1995.\n\nTwo years later, she recorded Ed Street with the Ed Hughes Quintet.\n\nJann Rutherford meets Julian Lee Enjoy highlights from the ABC Jazz archive with this special piano duet from New Zealanders Jann Rutherford and Julian Lee.\n\nRutherford also collaborated with blind multi-instrumentalist and braille music reader Julian Lee, who also came from Dunedin.\n\nTheir tribute album to pianist and composer Fats Waller was recently discovered in the archives of ABC Jazz.\n\nIn 1998, Rutherford released her solo piano album Discovery, containing 15 original compositions.\n\n\"I use tapes to write music, and I 'discovered' this tune a long time after I had written it,\" Rutherford explained about the titular track.\n\nRecording The Scented Garden\n\nRutherford was planning to record a new album in 2002, The Scented Garden, when she was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nDespite her illness, the recording went ahead.\n\nThe Scented Garden was Rutherford's last album, inspired by her mother's garden. (Tall Poppy Records)\n\nScott vividly recalls going into the studio with Rutherford and longtime collaborators saxophonists Paul Cutlan and Roger Manins and drummer Rease Cameron [formerly performing as Dave Goodman].\n\n\"We tried to get everything down in one take because Jann was really unwell,\" Scott says. \"She had very little petrol in the tank by then.\"\n\n\"I remember how wonderful she was on the session and how desperately keen we were to do our very best for her,\" Scott shares.\n\nShortly after recording The Scented Garden, Rutherford returned to New Zealand to be with her family.\n\nBefore Rutherford left Australia, Scott and other friends organised a tribute concert for her featuring music from the album.\n\n\"There was a huge outpouring of affection for Jann,\" Scott says. \"Matt McMahon played the piano because by then Jann was too sick.\"\n\n\"When we finished, I gave her a kiss on the cheek and I left. She went back to New Zealand and she passed away.\"\n\nThe Scented Garden was released posthumously.\n\nPaving the way for other young women in jazz\n\nRutherford's death left a huge hole in the Sydney jazz community, where she was well-loved and respected.\n\n\"She had the musical credentials to be at the vanguard of jazz,\" Scott reflects.\n\nThe Jann Rutherford Memorial Award Concert Listen to the 2025 Jann Rutherford Memorial Award Concert featuring 2025 recipient, pianist and composer Lauren Tsamouras, alongside Hilary Geddes, Jess Green and more.\n\nWhen Evans was asked to set up an award to support female instrumentalists, she named it in memory of Rutherford's extraordinary life.\n\nJazz has a DNA in diversity, with a history of protest against discrimination.\n\nThe music has also been a platform for several musicians with disability.\n\nBut according to Evans, it's harder for female instrumentalists to break through, despite legendary female jazz musicians like Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Nina Simone.\n\n\"In Sydney as well as in America, the history of female instrumentalists in jazz has been hidden,\" Evans reflects.\n\nThe Jann Rutherford Memorial Award was set up in conjunction with workshops platforming female instrumentalists by the Sydney Improvised Music Association.\n\nThe award was initially funded by a private donor, with additional support from Rutherford's royalties, the Mietta Foundation and ABC Jazz.\n\nIn its 20-year history, the award has been pivotal in opening opportunities for many influential jazz musicians of today, including guitarist Jess Green, electric bassist Lucy Clifford and drummer Hannah James.\n\nPianist Lauren Tsamouras is the recipient in 2025.\n\nClifford says the award helped her to achieve more recognition as a composer and form a band of her own.\n\nAs part of the award, she also recorded an album released by ABC Jazz.\n\nThat album, Between Spaces Of Knowing, recently won Best Jazz Album at the ARIA Awards.\n\n\"Lucy's creative spirit and musical excellence honour Jann's legacy in the most wonderful way,\" says Evans of Clifford's win.\n\nSome past award recipients have gone on to hold positions of influence in the jazz world, doing their part to continue Rutherford's trailblazing work.\n\nIn 2024, Green was appointed as the program leader for Sydney Conservatorium's Equity in Jazz Program, which focuses on female and gender diverse representation at the institution.\n\n\"There's not any [one] way to play jazz,\" Evans says.\n\n\"Everyone should have the same opportunity to share this joy.\"\n\nGet the latest jazz and classical music stories direct to your inbox",

        "text": "Mia King was the hard-luck story of the AFLW grand final.\n\nCoach Darren Crocker said before the game she could not have done much more to put herself in a position to be selected after missing every game since round nine with a knee injury.\n\nUltimately he felt it was \"too big a risk\" to pick her after 50 days without playing a game, saying it was \"one of the harder conversations I've ever had to have in football\".\n\nKangaroos make history in the books and on the field North Melbourne provesto be ground breakers and history makers as it extend its match-winning streak to 27 games in a comprehensive win over Brisbane.\n\nKing watched from the sidelines on Saturday night as her teammates claimed an historic second straight AFL Women's premiership.\n\nThe thumping 40-point win over the Lions, their opponents in the previous two deciders, would have surely come with a tinge of pain for the 24-year-old midfielder.\n\nBut her teammates made sure she did not miss a moment of the celebrations.\n\nTeammate Bella Eddey praised King for the way she carried herself leading up to the game.\n\n\"The way you've handled yourself this week has been so admirable,\" she told her.\n\nCrocker told her she was \"a big part of\" their journey to another flag, and Emma King, towering over her namesake, wrapped her in a long embrace and kissed her on the cheek.\n\nEmma and Mia King had a long embrace on the Princes Park turf.

Couldn't have got there without you,\" she said as Mia told her how proud she was of them.\n\nShe was not the only sidelined Roo on the night.\n\nNicole Bresnehan injured her hamstring in round one and was nearing a mid-season return when she tore her ACL at training, ruling her out of the rest of the season.\n\nThe 2024 premiership Roo was given the honour of presenting the cup to Garner and Crocker.\n\nShe tried to sneak off the stage after handing it over, but the cries came from the playing group: \"Get in there, Nicole.\"\n\nThe defender sheepishly posed with them for the lifting of the cup and was caught in hugs by a few more teammates as they rushed the stage, before making herself scarce as the confetti flew to end another undefeated season for the dominant side.",

        "text": "In Australia, one in 18 people are known to be living with diabetes \u2014 that's almost 1.5 million people.\n\nBut the condition is still misunderstood.\n\nAs November \u2014 which is also Diabetes Awareness Month \u2014 comes to an end, we've asked six people to share what living with diabetes is like, and what they want people to know about the condition.\n\nLet's get to know them.\n\nCarmen Azzopardi Carmen Azzopardi is a type 1 diabetic. ( ) Type 1 Carmen was 24 when she began rapidly losing weight despite not making any changes to her diet or lifestyle. It wasn't until May 2020 when a period lasted for almost three weeks that she decided she needed to see a doctor \u2014 and even then was hesitant. \"During that time was when COVID happened and so we went into lockdown, I lost my job and I had to move houses,\" she said. \"There was just a lot of other things going on that required my time and attention so I kind of put my health on the back burner.\" She saw a doctor a week after her 25th birthday and the results of her blood glucose test showed her level was between the high 20s and early 30mmols/L. The normal range for a non-diabetic is between 4.0 to 7.8. Carmen was sent to the emergency department to bring her levels down and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes the next day. She now works as a content creator, writer and disability advocate and uses her platform to educate people about chronic illnesses. Charlotte Crouch Charlotte Crouch has type 1 diabetes. ( ) Type 1 Charlotte was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 11 after she started having bad stomach aches and cramps. She was drinking large amounts of water and losing up to 5kg a week at times. \"When I would fall asleep, I would go into these comatose sleeps \u2026 it was really hard to get me out of bed in the morning,\" she said. Charlotte saw a GP and tested a blood sugar level of 27mmols/L and was diagnosed. Cassandra Glover Cassandra Glover is a type 1 diabetic. ( ) Type 1 Cassandra was seven when she started complaining about symptoms her nurse mum recognised as signs of diabetes. \"I was doing ballet classes and would always finish and say, 'Mum, I'm going to pass out, I need to eat something right now',\" Cassandra said. \"After a while she was like, 'OK, I'll test your blood sugar and see' and it turned out it was very low.\" After that she saw a GP and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Paul Whelan Paul Whelan is a type 2 diabetic. ( ) Type 2 Paul was regularly seeing his GP in 2019 for other health issues when he found out he also had type 2 diabetes. He had previously been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and anaemia, but didn't realise he had diabetes too. \"It wasn't until the GP had told me face to face that I had it, and I realised, obviously I had it there,\" Paul said. Layla Clarkson-Eather Layla Clarkson-Eather has type 2 diabetes. ( ) Type 2 Layla was in the emergency room for another reason when the results of a urine test found glucose was present. She was given a pinprick test and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, aged 24. \"It came as a bit of a shock because I'm young and I'm a healthy weight, my height and everything,\" Layla said. However, Layla later learnt that she was genetically predisposed \u2014 her dad was diagnosed two years before her and her mum two years later with type 2 diabetes. Gunnar Hardy Gunnar Hardy has MODY diabetes. ( ) MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) Gunnar was in the UK completing post-graduate studies in 2018 when he started feeling constantly run down, tired and was frequently sick. He discovered his blood pressure was extremely high during a visit to the dentist, which led him to get his bloods tested with a GP. \"When the doctor came in, he basically said to me, 'yeah, you're not managing your diabetes well' and I'm like, 'wait, what? I have diabetes?'\" He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed medication. Gunnar moved to Australia and his blood glucose levels continued to fluctuate, despite his medication and diet. When Gunnar was 24, his wife found him wandering aimlessly and checked his blood sugar levels. They were normal, but his ketones were 30 times the normal level. He was taken to hospital where a specialist said Gunnar had type 1 diabetes \u2014 but further genetic testing revealed Gunnar had a rare type of diabetes known as MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young), which is caused by deletion of a gene. It affects people under 25. Gunnar's subtype of diabetes means he does not produce his own insulin and is also insulin resistant. Jenni Short Tim and Jenni short both have type 2 diabetes, but Jenni is in remission. ( ) Type 2 (in remission) When Jenni's husband Tim was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, she decided to regularly check her HbA1c levels \u2014 the amount of glucose attached to the haemoglobin in red blood cells. Her levels were pre-diabetic at 5.8 per cent in 2021before rising to 8.5 per cent three months later \u2014 putting her in the diabetes range at 51. Jenni was already eating a diabetic diet to support her husband, but reduced her carb intake and started intermittent fasting after being diagnosed. After a year, her HbA1c levels returned to normal and at six months after that, she was declared in remission. Diabetes expert Professor Elif Ekinci, Director of the Australian Centre for Accelerating Diabetes Innovations (ACADI) at the University of Melbourne. ( ) Professor Elif Ekinci is the director of the Australian Centre for Accelerating Diabetes Innovations (ACADI) at the University of Melbourne. She is a clinician scientist and an academic endocrinologist whose research is focused on prevention, detection and treatment of diabetes and its related complications. She spoke with the ABC to provide more information about diabetes.\n\nWith decades of lived experience between them, they have educated their families and fielded countless questions from curious friends, colleagues and people they encounter in their daily lives.\n\nHere is what they want you to know (tap on the links for more details):\n\nThis is what the six people we spoke to had to say:\n\nType 1 and type 2 are different, and they're not the only types\n\nCharlotte and Cassandra said as type 1s, they frequently needed to explain they were not type 2, and what the difference was.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a lifelong, autoimmune condition where the body produces little to no insulin, and it affects 134,000 Australians.\n\nType 2, which 1.3 million Australians live with, is a condition where the body is insulin-resistant and gradually loses capacity to produce enough insulin, often caused by genetics and lifestyle factors.\n\n\"People don't realise type 1 can't go away,\" Cassandra said.\n\n\"I've had people my whole life being like, 'Don't worry, you'll just eat a salad and go for a run and it'll go away'.\n\n\"It's not something that can actually be cured.\"\n\nDr Ekinci said type 1 was the result of the body making antibodies that over time destroy the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas is located behind the stomach. ( )\n\n\"It's one which cannot be managed without insulin because you can die from that because you can get diabetic ketoacidosis, which is when the ketone levels build up in your blood,\" she said.\n\nKetones are a chemical by-product from when the body uses fat for energy instead of glucose.\n\nA third type is gestational diabetes, which occurs when high blood glucose levels appear during pregnancy. Most people who develop it will no longer have it after giving birth.\n\nWhile it doesn't guarantee the baby will be born with diabetes, it does increase their risk of developing type 2.\n\nDr Ekinci said other less common types of diabetes included type 3C, caused by damage to the pancreas from surgery or diseases like pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis; Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) caused by a single gene disorder; and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), which is similar to type 1 diabetes that presents later in life.\n\nDiabetes doesn't discriminate\n\nLayla said many people were surprised she had type 2 diabetes because of her age and healthy weight.\n\n\"Not everyone fits the stereotypical type 2 profile,\" she said.\n\n\"I am guilty of beating myself up about this, I'm not obese, I'm not old, why do I have this?\"\n\n\"But everyone has their different stories and different experiences.\"\n\nGunnar said he frequently had to explain MODY diabetes was not caused by eating sugar or not exercising.\n\nCarmen said it was a common misconception that type 1 diabetes only occurred in childhood.\n\nCarmen Azzopardi is a type 1 diabetic. ( )\n\n\"The week that I was diagnosed, there was also an 88-year-old woman in Australia who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes,\" she said.\n\n\"So I think people think, '25, that's so old,' and it's actually not.\n\n\"Autoimmune conditions can come up at any age.\"\n\nDr Ekinci reiterated diabetes could happen to anyone, even when there wasn't a family history, and there were other risk factors that needed further study.\n\n\"Things like a stressful environment, not enough sleep, other things that could contribute to the pancreas not working,\" she said.\n\n\"Sadly, there's a lot of stigma attached to the condition, so it's really important to emphasise that it can just happen and it's not the person's fault.\"\n\nDiabetes requires a lot of decision-making that can lead to burnout\n\nPeople with diabetes are estimated to make 180 health-related decisions a day.\n\nCassandra said decisions included everything from how much to eat before exercising to ensuring she had enough sugar in case she got hypoglycaemia (hypo).\n\nAll those extra health-related decisions can make the basic ones harder.\n\n\"Sometimes my partner will ask what I want for dinner and I literally cannot decide,\" Cassandra said.\n\nDecision fatigue can lead to diabetes burnout.\n\nLoading...\n\nA global survey by the International Diabetes Federation found 79 per cent of people had experienced diabetes burnout, and three-quarters of them had stopped or interrupted treatment due to stress or feeling overwhelmed.\n\nCarmen said she switched from manual insulin injections to a pump because she was becoming fatigued.\n\n\"I wasn't actually paying attention to what I was doing when I was injecting, so I was getting my injections wrong a lot, which obviously causes some immediate and also long-term complications,\" she said.\n\n\"It's actually a constant uphill battle.\n\n\"Sometimes I just wish I could end up in hospital \u2026 just so I could have somebody else take care of it for me, even for a day or even for a night, because it's just such a constant, constant weight on my mind and on my body that it feels quite inescapable.\"\n\nDiabetes is linked to other health conditions\n\nDr Ekinci said people with type 1 diabetes were predisposed to other autoimmune conditions, including coeliac disease, underactive thyroid, hypothyroid and Addison's disease.\n\nPostnatal programs supporting women after diabetes diagnosis One in five pregnant women are diagnosed with the condition, which experts say is linked to age, weight and a lack of exercise.\n\nShe said diabetes was the leading cause of blindness, was linked to kidney disease, could cause nerve damage, affect brain blood vessels and lead to stroke, and could contribute to cardiovascular disease and heart failure.\n\n\"It can also lead to what's called peripheral vascular disease or blocked arteries in the feet [and] can lead to amputations, especially in combination with nerve damage,\" she said.\n\nDr Ekinci said people outside of the diabetes community may not be aware of internal damage.\n\n\"The person might look externally well, but inside there's damage that's been done to their blood vessels,\" she said.\n\nPaul said he often felt crippled by his comorbidities.\n\n\"I've got my chronic kidney disease and anaemia, so you might have other comorbidities that affect the type 2 diabetes,\" he said.\n\nA 2016 study found people with diabetes were two to three times more likely to develop depression than those without.\n\n\"There are times when I don't want to get out of bed in the morning because the weight of having to maintain my illness just feels like too much,\" Carmen said.\n\nBetter technology has changed what diabetes devices look like\n\nTechnology like continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and insulin pumps help maintain blood sugar levels with less manual decision-making.\n\nCharlotte has her insulin pump connected to an app which can calculate the exact amount of insulin she needs based off the food she eats.\n\n\"I think if people knew \u2026 how advanced technology is now there would probably be a lot more conversations on how we can move it further,\" she said.\n\nInsulin pumps mimic how the pancreas would naturally release insulin. ( )\n\nCassandra, Carmen and Charlotte all said people often did not know what a CGM or insulin pump looked like, confusing them with pagers and nicotine patches.\n\n\"[The insulin pump] is literally my pancreas,\" Gunnar said.\n\n\"It's not a pager, it's not a cell phone, it's not an iPod, it's not anything like that.\n\n\"It is an item that has a hormone in it that literally keeps me alive every single day.\"\n\nGunnar said he had received judgemental looks when manually injecting insulin from strangers, thinking he was using illicit substances.\n\nContinuous blood glucose monitors are usually attached to the back of the upper arm or the stomach. ( )\n\nCarmen said she had even had strangers try to touch and grab her CGM.\n\n\"When people think about disabilities and people think about mobility aids and medical devices, they think wheelchairs or they think prosthetics, or maybe they even think hearing aids,\" she said.\n\n\"But they don't think about CGMs or insulin pumps or even stomas as medical tech and therefore they don't approach it in the same way.\"\n\nLiving with diabetes is expensive\n\nCassandra says without health insurance she wouldn't be able to afford her insulin pump. ( )\n\nWhile the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) helps cover many diabetes-associated costs, there are several out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nCGMs are only subsidised for type 1 diabetes. Out of pocket they cost up to $5,000 a year.\n\nCassandra pays $350 a month for private health insurance \u2014 without it she could not afford an insulin pump, which cost upward of $7,000 to purchase outright.\n\nUnder the PBS, insulin costs $31.60 per prescription, which lasts three to six months depending on individual needs.\n\n'Game-changing' diabetes technologies out of reach Patients like Sammy Haigh spend hundreds of dollars every month managing their diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes is sometimes treated with medication, but Dr Ekinci said people could also be given medication to treat related issues such as high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\n\"It's the extra medications, it's the extra doctor's visits, it's also the visit to the podiatrist, optometrist, the pharmacist, all those extra visits that can cost a lot of money,\" Dr Ekinci said.\n\n\"If you can afford private insurance and you've got a good salary, you can pay for a lot of these things.\n\n\"But if you're really struggling to pay the rent, to pay your groceries, I have seen many people where they can't buy their medications.\"\n\nPeople with diabetes know what they can eat\n\nDr Ekinci described type 1 diabetes as like walking a constant tightrope, ensuring glucose levels were correct \u2014 which meant sometimes people needed to eat sugar.\n\n\"I think the number one thing that I hate is when somebody says 'should you eat that?'\" Gunnar said.\n\n\"I know what I'm going to eat, and I know how it's going to affect my blood sugar.\"\n\nGunnar Hardy knows better than strangers what he needs to eat to manage his diabetes. ( )\n\nJenni said a low-carb diet helped her go into remission, but her husband, who is also type 2, sometimes needed carbs to manage his diabetes.\n\n\"[A lot of people] can't understand that different diabetics react differently to different carbs,\" Jenni said.\n\nDr Ekinci said studies had shown Mediterranean and high protein diets could be beneficial to managing and preventing type 2, but people with all types would know what worked for them.\n\nBe kind and ask how you can help\n\nGunnar and Charlotte said fluctuating blood sugar levels severely affected their moods, and that could carry a lot of guilt.\n\n\"I'm doing life as rough as everyone else \u2026 and then I have this on top of it,\" Gunnar said.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm going to have to take a sick day. It's not because I'm lazy, it's not because I'm using an excuse to get out of work.\n\n\"I'm a hard worker. I love what I do \u2026 but sometimes I've got to serve and protect myself too.\"\n\nCarmen encouraged people to ask the people in their lives with diabetes how you could support them.\n\n\"I think a lot of the time \u2026 people who don't have experience with [disabilities] feel too scared that they're going to say or do the wrong thing, so they end up doing nothing at all,\" she said.\n\n\"When in reality, I think nine times out of 10, all the people who I know that live with disabilities and diabetes would really appreciate someone just asking them, 'Hey, what can I do?'\"\n\nType 2 remission is possible\n\nJenni said people were often surprised when she told them she had gone into type 2 remission.\n\n\"They think going into remission is a complete myth,\" she said.\n\n\"It's rare, it's not a myth, it does happen.\"\n\nStudies cited by Diabetes Australia show remission is possible through intensive dietary change, with about 50 per cent of people able to achieve it in the first year of diagnosis.\n\nJenni said regular HbA1c testing helped her recognise when her levels were pre-diabetic so she could make changes early, which she believed helped her achieve remission.\n\nJenni is a full-time carer of her husband Tim. ( )\n\nDr Ekinci encouraged the public to check their HbA1c levels, which can be done through a blood test.\n\n\"We are finding out more and more that type 2 diabetes remission can happen in 10 to 15 per cent of people with changes to their lifestyle,\" she said.\n\n\"But if they're in the pre-diabetes run, you can really help prevent diabetes.\"\n\nPeople with diabetes live normal, full lives\n\nCharlotte Crouch has type 1 diabetes. ( )\n\nIn her spare time, Charlotte enjoys going to the gym, playing golf and staying active.\n\nShe wants people to know with proper management, people with diabetes can live just as full a life as people without it.\n\n\"Diabetes doesn't hold us back,\" she said.\n\n\"It doesn't hold us back from doing sport, it doesn't hold us back from going out partying, having fun.\"\n\nDr Ekinci agreed.",

        "text": "The electoral study provides much insight into how the Coalition has got to this point. Women, who once were more likely to vote for the Coalition than Labor, are now firmly backing left-of-centre parties and candidates. Just 28 per cent of women \u2013 the single largest voting bloc in the country \u2013 backed the Coalition, compared to 37 per cent of men. \u201cThe shift from the traditional to the modern gender gap can be understood in part through changes in society, including the role of secularisation, higher education and higher workforce participation among women,\u201d the survey said.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s political parties have also transformed over the past few decades in the degree to which their representatives reflect the broader community.\u201d Loading As noted in this masthead last week, the 50 Labor women MPs outnumber the Coalition in the lower house. Ley promises there are new policies coming to woo back women. There\u2019s another, growing, problem for the Coalition. Support along generational lines is swing sharply towards Labor. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Z (post-1996) accounted for 42 per cent of voters at this year\u2019s election. Among millennials, Coalition support has fallen from 38 per cent in 2016 to 21 per cent. Labor\u2019s support among this cohort has climbed from 33 per cent to 37 per cent, giving Albanese a 64-32 lead over Peter Dutton.\n\nAmong people in their 30s and 40s, support for the Coalition has fallen almost half. \u201cThis is no longer a cohort of fickle young voters, but a generation at a \u2018steep\u2019 part of the life course with respect to earning power, family responsibilities and wealth accumulation,\u201d the study noted. By the time of the next election, Millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will account for more than half of all voters. The only generations backing the Coalition \u2013 Boomers and those born before 1945 \u2013 are dying away. Not only is the Coalition support base disappearing, the proportion of rusted-on voters is diminishing. In the late 1960s more than a third of Coalition voters stuck with the party no matter what. That proportion is now just 13 per cent.\n\nThat fracturing was part of the problem for Joyce. \u201cAll the time we said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got to win back teal seats\u2019,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cAnd what was happening, is people, especially in regional seats, they say: if that\u2019s what you want to focus on, we\u2019re gone. There are more One Nation members now in Tamworth than there are Nationals members.\u201d The maverick MPs\u2019 defection has whittled Ley\u2019s lower house team down to just 42 members of 150. Joyce announced his long-signalled shift out of the Nationals the same day as Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 who he served as deputy PM \u2013 was in Canberra to unveil his formal portrait.\n\nTurnbull weighed in on the problems plaguing the Liberal party a decade after he became prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting now that we\u2019re still having the same insane conversations on the right of politics about energy. I mean, it\u2019s really ludicrous,\u201d he said. At the unveiling of his official portrait this week, Malcolm Turnbull noted: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting now that we\u2019re still having the same insane conversations on the right of politics ...\u201d Credit: Alex Ellinghausen \u201cWhen I was Prime Minister, I used to say tediously \u2026 Energy policy should be determined by engineering and economics, not ideology and idiocy. It\u2019s kind of common sense, isn\u2019t it? \u201cBut nothing\u2019s changed. Here we are.\u201d It was a pointed remark in front of the handful Coalition colleagues, including Ley, in the audience. More telling was the turnout from five teal independent MPs who also came to hear him speak, each representing electorates that were once Liberal strongholds, including Turnbull\u2019s former seat.\n\nLey is expecting a review, by Pru Goward and Nick Minchin, of the Coalition\u2019s disastrous campaign to be made public in the coming weeks. \u201cIt will be frank and fearless because I\u2019ve asked it to be,\u201d she said last week. \u201cThe next question is, how do we make the modern Liberal Party fit for the future?\u201d Loading She will have to reverse the reputational damage that\u2019s come from the past two elections, and the infighting that has followed. For all the problems facing Ley and the Coalition, another was confirmed on Friday \u2013 money. The Australian Electoral Commission on Friday released the final public funding for candidates at the 2025 election. If a candidate receives 4 per cent of the vote, they receive $3.386 in public financial support for every ballot they receive.\n\nLabor topped the funding with $37 million. The Liberal Party received $28.2 million. Last election, Labor was paid $27.1 million and the Liberal\u2019s $26.6 million. Back in 2019, when votes were worth $2.756 each, the Liberals received $27.6 million compared to Labor\u2019s $24.7 million. Parties rely on money to survive and campaign. Since their 2019 victory, their public support has climbed a little more than 2 per cent, or $600,000 \u2013 nowhere near inflation. Labor\u2019s funding has increased by 50 per cent, or well over $12 million. That gives Labor and Anthony Albanese a major advantage over the Liberal party, and whoever may be in charge of the party, come the 2028 election.",

        "text": "As Australians prepare for Christmas and holiday plans, COVID-19 might make a quiet comeback.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Griffin, an infectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist from the University of Queensland, says while COVID-19 remains unpredictable, it is fairly likely we'll see another wave relatively soon, on the balance of probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not necessarily predictable just yet, but we certainly should be prepared because it would seem likely,\" Griffin told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Australia has experienced an increase in COVID-19 cases during the summer and winter months.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Critical Health Resources Information System (CHRIS) show that, since 2022, the number of COVID-19 cases in intensive care units historically has increased from December to January. CHRIS monitors intensive care unit activity.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors are behind Australia's COVID-19 summer waves, including the winter in the northern hemisphere and Christmas travellers.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 travelling from northern hemisphere\n\n\"Transmission is more likely when the conditions suit, as in winter. But on our side of the world, if the transmission increases on the other side of the world, we see an increase in cases here as well,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While we can't necessarily predict a wave, it is likely that, due to those factors, we will see an increase at some point in the not-too-distant future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, data shows the recent COVID-19 summer wave in Australia was not as severe as the previous ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a surge of cases in January 2023, the highest weekly average of ICU cases reached 113. In January 2025, this number decreased by 34 during the same period, according to CHRIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We certainly shouldn't get complacent and assume that's going to continue to be the case ... We do need to make sure we continue to be prepared and not just to assume that it's going to be something that gets milder and milder,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\nSome other experts believe the current COVID-19 pattern will continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, told SBS News the COVID-19 situation in the previous summer was \"one of the least detectable waves\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was a bit of a rise over the summer period, that probably coincided with some people travelling to the northern hemisphere, where they were going through a winter wave,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 27 November, 6,524 COVID-19 cases had been reported in November, according to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, an almost 11 per cent decrease from October.\n\n\n\n\n\nBennett said she thinks Australia could see more COVID activity but it \"thankfully won't be like our winter waves\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's probably, hopefully, going to be like last year [where] there's no distinct wave where suddenly there's a lot more people sick, but there's just signs of more activity.\"\n\n\n\nBennett said the COVID-19 summer waves in Australia have faded away somewhat over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of it's to do with our natural immunity maturity,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the virus circulating in the community without getting really sick, people are still boosting their immunity.\"\n\n\n\nPeople with health conditions should be prepared\n\nBut with a new COVID-19 wave or just increased activity, experts agree vulnerable people should be better prepared for the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Health, people aged 65 or older, pregnant women, and those with specific conditions such as a weakened immune system, neurological disease, chronic lung disease, heart disease, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney disease are at \"a higher risk of becoming very sick from COVID-19\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople over 75 are recommended to receive two booster doses per year, and those over 18 with a weakened immune system can consider a second dose.\n\n\n\n\n\nBennett said now is the time these people should be considering a second dose due to the increase in activities over the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having a dose now and then, having another one, in May before we go into the winter wave, which is usually a bit more substantial, that's probably the timing that will give them the best benefit,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRemaining home while having symptoms and wearing masks remain inseparable ways of fighting COVID-19, Bennett said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're unwell at Christmas and the whole family's getting together, all the generations, it's better for the family if you don't go,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Putting on a mask just helps you not ruin someone else's Christmas or worse, pass the virus onto someone else who might be more vulnerable to severe illness.\"\n\n\n\nFlu on the rise\n\nWhile the next days and weeks will determine the situation of the COVID-19 cases in Australia, another respiratory disease is at unseasonably elevated levels in some parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1 January until this week, the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System reported 1,713 Australians per 100,000 were infected with the flu, making it the highest year on record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Thursday, over 456,000 Australians have been diagnosed with flu, and more than 52,000 of those infections were in kids under four.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin said this is \"definitely not usual\".\n\n\n\n\"We saw high numbers of interseasonal flu cases at the start of the year, and we continue to see more flu than we might expect, given that we're past the peak period that we normally see in the cooler time of the year,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This year, we're going to probably surpass all records for flu cases and maybe even exceed 500,000 cases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month NSW health authorities said: \"Influenza is stable at a moderate level of activity and is driven predominantly by influenza A. This sustained activity is unusual for this time of year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners reports this year, only 25 per cent of Australian children aged six months to five years received vaccinations \u2014 the lowest level since 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at least 60 per cent of those aged 65 and over were vaccinated, marking the lowest level since 2020.\n\n\n\n",

So, mature-age women that want to earn a bit more money tax free to go back into - so retired childcare professionals - go back into the system, because having that maturity and that wisdom in a facility, they can spot signs and they can train up people and mentor people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is also trialling the use of CCTV in centres and introducing a national register of childcare workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Melbourne childcare worker Joshua Brown, who worked at 24 centres, was charged with sexually abusing eight children under the age of two.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland's Liberal National Party has claimed victory in the Hinchinbrook by-election in North Queensland, with a large swing against the incumbent Katter's Australia Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith most of the first preferences counted, the LNP's Wayde Chiesa has more than 40 per cent of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Katter Australia Party had 30 per cent, and One Nation just over 13 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe by-election was triggered by the resignation of Nick Dametto, who left parliament to successfully contest the Townsville mayoral race.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 200 firefighters are working to contain a massive blaze at a waste facility factory in Sydney's west.\n\n\n\n\n\nA huge fire ball erupted, sending flames up to 150 metres into the sky above the St Mary's site, as flames took hold around 11pm last night [[Saturday]].\n\n\n\n\n\nA large chemical tank was also blown into the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Rescue New South Wales Commissioner, Jeremy Fewtrell, says firefighters have been doing an amazing job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got 50 fire trucks here of various types.

And now this incident happened, costing the lives of residents. It\u2019s infuriating. For now, we\u2019ll wait for the neighbors to settle things.

The statement points to values including freedom of the individual, freedom of religion, commitment to the rule of law, and equality. Permanent applicants have an additional statement regarding a commitment to learning the English language.\n\n\n\nEnglish language tests under scrutiny\n\nSeparately, one of the men in charge of formulating the Coalition's policy, opposition home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam, says the policy could include a new test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are looking at how best to assess someone's commitment to our country \u2026 and there are a range of ways of doing that, and it may be that, of course, a condition on a visa might be one of those things that we inquire about, or revisiting the citizenship test,\" he told News Corp on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also reportedly flagged the strengthening of English language requirements for foreign students, if the Coalition wins the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the requirements, the standards of these tests, do need to be improved,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey would not confirm the statements, but flagged the party policy would be unveiled before the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They will include a variety of things,\" she told Sky News.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition faced criticism earlier this year after comments made by Northern Territory senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My criticism of this government around migration policy is \u2026 not a criticism of any migrant or migrant community,\" Ley said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a massive failing of governments to build the infrastructure that our communities need, and they're rightly concerned about that.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Like many modern relationships, it started with a slide into DMs on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than six years after a love of the South Sydney Rabbitohs introduced Anthony Albanese to Jodie Haydon, the pair declared their love for each other in an intimate wedding ceremony at The Lodge in Canberra on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese, then opposition leader, was a keynote speaker at a national union conference in Melbourne in 2019 when a quip about the Rabbitohs during his address led him to be introduced to Haydon.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter referencing South Sydney during the speech, Haydon yelled out \"up the Rabbitohs\", which would later prompt messages on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I slid into his DMs,\" Haydon told News Corp in 2022.\n\n\n\n\"He had a public profile and I didn't, so I knew that we both followed the same footy team, we both had a love for the inner west and I think I said in that direct message 'hey, we're both single'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on the connection in 2024, Albanese told a Brisbane radio station it was \"a very strange way\" to meet someone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Who would've thought that romance could begin there?\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages on Twitter led to first dates over craft beer at a Newtown brewery in Sydney and soon a relationship.\n\n\n\nHaydon has accompanied Albanese on overseas trips, including to the United Kingdom. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch When Albanese was involved in a serious car accident in 2021, Haydon said it had crystallised many feelings she had about him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was very scary, and in that moment, you realise just how much you love this person \u2014 the fear of losing them. As I jumped in the ambulance and saw Anthony, I knew then the depth of my feelings towards him,\" she told the Australian Women's Weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple were regularly seen with each other publicly in the lead up to the 2022 election, with Haydon front and centre with Albanese during his victory speech on election night.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has been a regular presence on overseas visits with the prime minister, including to the US and world summits.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair's wedding \u2014 described by former Opposition leader Peter Dutton as \"our version of the royal wedding\" \u2014 at the Lodge was the same location where Albanese popped the question to Haydon on Valentine's Day in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese proposed with a ring he designed, following a dinner at an Italian restaurant in the Canberra suburb of Braddon that night.\n\n\n\nAlbanese was the first prime minister to be engaged while in office, and has become the first to be married while serving in the role. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi \"We are thrilled and excited to share this news and look forward to spending the rest of our lives together,\" the couple said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are so lucky to have found each other.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese was the first prime minister to be engaged while in office, and has become the first to be married while serving in the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the moment the couple were engaged, speculation had swirled about where and when the wedding would take place, as well as what would be involved on the big day.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese said he had been looking to get married in the second half of the year, after the May election, although he said there was consideration of nuptials on the anniversary of their engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We did think about it, I've got to say, on the anniversary, really quietly, just doing it to stop speculation,\" Albanese told B105 Brisbane in March.\n\n\n\n\"But we decided that might get some speculation as well, so we didn't. [But] I did think about doing it really quietly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple hadn't revealed many details about what the wedding would look like, beyond the prime minister's dog Toto being involved in the ceremony as a possible ring bearer and that it would be on the smaller side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's going to be a great day in front of family and friends. Pretty small and something that's about myself and Jodie rather than a big public event,\" Albanese told ABC Radio.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a political honeymoon that has lasted several months following a large election victory in May, Albanese and his wife are about to enjoy a honeymoon of their own.\n\n\n\n",

We're 27 years old, and we feel like we're just getting started,\" El Jannah CEO Brett Houldin told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been a great opportunity to go and find the right partner for us, a partner that will help us continue on the journey that we've been on of bringing Lebanese culture and food to Australians.\"\n\n\n\nUpholding the traditions\n\nGeneral Atlantic has approximately US $118 billion ($180 billion) in assets under its management.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American investor has acquired a controlling stake in the charcoal chicken chain for an undisclosed amount, which Houldin describes as a \"big number\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a meaningful valuation for the organisation and something that we're proud of,\" Houldin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the new partnership, El Jannah aims to open more than 25 restaurants over the next 12 months and expand to 200 stores across Australia over the next five years.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Exclusive: El Jannah CEO speaks with SBS as company goes global & ASX rises SBS News 12:11 English\n\nInternational expansion was \"definitely on the cards\", Houldin added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It'll make sure that we can do it in a really measured and successful way, and we can just continue to reinvest in our service culture, our food quality,\" Houldin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We bring our food into the restaurant every day, and we want to uphold all those traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"El Jannah has the opportunity to go to so many great places. We were looking at markets across the world.

In the past three years, the business opened its first stores outside Sydney in Melbourne and Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe restaurant has said that with a new partnership with General Atlantic, the family founders will remain deeply involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are over the moon,\" Houldin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're particularly proud of all of our team members, our franchisees, and the rest of the business that have led us to this point, but equally excited for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'll never lose sight of what made us who we are.

But these are a really great insects because they consume food waste as their job and they're a non vector, non pest species. So they're very easy to farm without risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the GOTERRA factory in Sydney\u2019s west, insects are growing fat on left over food. And while farming fly larvae isn\u2019t for everyone \u2013 Ms Yarger says she\u2019s found her niche!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to maggots in a box, managing food waste and delivering a protein in the world, we\u2019re number one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win for GOTERRA, the insects pump out fertiliser for farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs chief sustainability officer Justin Frank explains, at the end of their life cycle the larvae are sold as chicken feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The chickens love it. They're designed to eat larvae and bugs, so they love it. It's really good for their gut health, but it's also full of amino acids that helps them produce eggs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s no shortage of food waste to process, with more than 7.6 million tonnes dumped every year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Lisa Bai is a research fellow at the University of Queensland's School of Chemical Engineering \u2013 and a food waste expert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(It's) costing the Australian economy around 36 billion every year. to each household it's probably causing us to waste about $2,500 every year. That's really a shocking number!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nState governments are taking action around household waste. In several states, including NSW, businesses will soon be asked to step up, too!\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Geddes is executive Director Programs and Innovation at the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority or EPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Next year there are new rules coming in for food recycling and for reducing the amount of food waste that ends up in our landfills. From the 1st of July, 2026, large food generating businesses such as hospitality venues, educational institutions, correctional centres, and supermarkets will need to separate their food waste from their general waste. By 2030 all households across New South Wales will need to separate their waste.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the new rules? Well, Ms Geddes says we\u2019re simply running out of room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a landfill crisis. We will be running out of landfill capacity by 2030. We know that between a quarter and a third of the waste generated is food waste. We need to keep this out of landfills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates say halving food waste by 2030 could deliver a $58 billion net benefit to the economy \u2013 but there are challenges, too as Dr Bai explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest growing problem for food waste treatment and management is contamination. Contamination levels are rising. We're not just finding metals and glass in the waste, we're also seeing in PFAS and microplastics accumulating in this waste. And this is introducing a real risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is why we all need to clean up our act, according to the EPA\u2019s Ms Geddes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rules are incredibly clear. It's only food waste and food scraps that goes into source separation for food, no plastics, no metals, nothing else. And we know that our communities are adopting this at the household level. And we know that this is what businesses are going to do when mandates come in from next year because it's so important to keep a clean stream of organic material to be used in items like compost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting plastic from food is a slow process, but Ms Geddes says every repurposed kilogram helps the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When food waste degrades in a landfill, it releases methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas 24 times stronger than carbon dioxide. So there are real benefits to reducing emissions by separating our food and allowing it to be turned into compost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSheep farmer turned entrepreneur Olympia Yarger says extracting value from food waste is also good business.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The electoral study provides much insight into how the Coalition has got to this point. Women, who once were more likely to vote for the Coalition than Labor, are now firmly backing left-of-centre parties and candidates. Just 28 per cent of women \u2013 the single largest voting bloc in the country \u2013 backed the Coalition, compared to 37 per cent of men. \u201cThe shift from the traditional to the modern gender gap can be understood in part through changes in society, including the role of secularisation, higher education and higher workforce participation among women,\u201d the survey said.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s political parties have also transformed over the past few decades in the degree to which their representatives reflect the broader community.\u201d Loading As noted in this masthead last week, the 50 Labor women MPs outnumber the Coalition in the lower house. Ley promises there are new policies coming to woo back women. There\u2019s another, growing, problem for the Coalition. Support along generational lines is swing sharply towards Labor. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Z (post-1996) accounted for 42 per cent of voters at this year\u2019s election. Among millennials, Coalition support has fallen from 38 per cent in 2016 to 21 per cent. Labor\u2019s support among this cohort has climbed from 33 per cent to 37 per cent, giving Albanese a 64-32 lead over Peter Dutton.\n\nAmong people in their 30s and 40s, support for the Coalition has fallen almost half. \u201cThis is no longer a cohort of fickle young voters, but a generation at a \u2018steep\u2019 part of the life course with respect to earning power, family responsibilities and wealth accumulation,\u201d the study noted. By the time of the next election, Millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will account for more than half of all voters. The only generations backing the Coalition \u2013 Boomers and those born before 1945 \u2013 are dying away. Not only is the Coalition support base disappearing, the proportion of rusted-on voters is diminishing. In the late 1960s more than a third of Coalition voters stuck with the party no matter what. That proportion is now just 13 per cent.\n\nThat fracturing was part of the problem for Joyce. \u201cAll the time we said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got to win back teal seats\u2019,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cAnd what was happening, is people, especially in regional seats, they say: if that\u2019s what you want to focus on, we\u2019re gone. There are more One Nation members now in Tamworth than there are Nationals members.\u201d The maverick MPs\u2019 defection has whittled Ley\u2019s lower house team down to just 42 members of 150. Joyce announced his long-signalled shift out of the Nationals the same day as Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 who he served as deputy PM \u2013 was in Canberra to unveil his formal portrait.\n\nTurnbull weighed in on the problems plaguing the Liberal party a decade after he became prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting now that we\u2019re still having the same insane conversations on the right of politics about energy. I mean, it\u2019s really ludicrous,\u201d he said. At the unveiling of his official portrait this week, Malcolm Turnbull noted: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting now that we\u2019re still having the same insane conversations on the right of politics ...\u201d Credit: Alex Ellinghausen \u201cWhen I was Prime Minister, I used to say tediously \u2026 Energy policy should be determined by engineering and economics, not ideology and idiocy. It\u2019s kind of common sense, isn\u2019t it? \u201cBut nothing\u2019s changed. Here we are.\u201d It was a pointed remark in front of the handful Coalition colleagues, including Ley, in the audience. More telling was the turnout from five teal independent MPs who also came to hear him speak, each representing electorates that were once Liberal strongholds, including Turnbull\u2019s former seat.\n\nLey is expecting a review, by Pru Goward and Nick Minchin, of the Coalition\u2019s disastrous campaign to be made public in the coming weeks. \u201cIt will be frank and fearless because I\u2019ve asked it to be,\u201d she said last week. \u201cThe next question is, how do we make the modern Liberal Party fit for the future?\u201d Loading She will have to reverse the reputational damage that\u2019s come from the past two elections, and the infighting that has followed. For all the problems facing Ley and the Coalition, another was confirmed on Friday \u2013 money. The Australian Electoral Commission on Friday released the final public funding for candidates at the 2025 election. If a candidate receives 4 per cent of the vote, they receive $3.386 in public financial support for every ballot they receive.\n\nLabor topped the funding with $37 million. The Liberal Party received $28.2 million. Last election, Labor was paid $27.1 million and the Liberal\u2019s $26.6 million. Back in 2019, when votes were worth $2.756 each, the Liberals received $27.6 million compared to Labor\u2019s $24.7 million. Parties rely on money to survive and campaign. Since their 2019 victory, their public support has climbed a little more than 2 per cent, or $600,000 \u2013 nowhere near inflation. Labor\u2019s funding has increased by 50 per cent, or well over $12 million. That gives Labor and Anthony Albanese a major advantage over the Liberal party, and whoever may be in charge of the party, come the 2028 election.",

Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nShe said she speaks with Mr Joyce \u201cregularly\u201d and has done so since his resignation.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAs I said, we\u2019re friends and, over the years, I\u2019ve checked in on him from time to time, because the collegiate relationship many of us have in the building, sometimes it\u2019s overlooked by people outside the (parliament), but it\u2019s important to keep those things front and centre,\u201d Ms Ley said.\n\nAsked point blank if she had \u201curged him not to go to One Nation\u201d, she said she had not.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t, because these are decisions for him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat he does is a matter for him. He\u2019s not a member of my party room.\u201d\n\nMs Ley also refused to weigh in on the falling out between Mr Joyce and Mr Littleproud.\n\n\u201cI simply leave all of the conversations around that to the individuals involved,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cSimple as that.\u201d\n\nMr Joyce has said he remains undecided on whether to join One Nation.\n\nHowever, he has played into speculation he could join the nationalist party and had dinner with leader Pauline Hanson in her office days before quitting the Coalition.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation on Thursday, Mr Joyce told the Lower House he was \u201casked to leave\u201d the Coalition twice by former Liberal leader Peter Dutton, but that his relationship with Mr Littleproud pushed him to quit.\n\nHe confirmed the same day that Ms Ley never asked him to leave.\n\nMP Barnaby Joyce has quit the Nationals. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nA former deputy prime minister, Mr Joyce was booted from his shadow cabinet position after the federal election in a move Mr Littleproud put down to \u201cgenerational change\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBoth the phrase and the demotion ruffled Mr Joyce\u2019s feathers and left him to lead a crusade against net zero from the backbench, undermining Ms Ley and Mr Littleproud\u2019s shared vision of a wholesale post-vote review.\n\nTensions boiled over in October when Mr Joyce announced he would not run for his seat of New England at the next election and flagged he might not sit in the Nationals party room, sparking speculation he could defect to the crossbench.\n\nMr Joyce singled out Mr Littleproud\u2019s claim that his backbench banishment was a matter of \u201cgenerational change\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow, in the past, I\u2019ve been asked to leave twice by Peter Dutton, and I suppose \u2026 when they talk about generational change, it\u2019s pretty clear what people want,\u201d Mr Joyce told the chamber.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things, though \u2026 is that after five weeks, I announced this about five weeks ago, apart from a 90-second phone conversation with the leader, I\u2019ve had no communication with either leader of the National Party or the deputy leader of the National Party to try and resolve this, and that\u2019s disappointing.\n\n\u201cSo after 30 years with the National Party, I\u2019m resigning from the party, and that really leaves me with a heavy heart, and I apologise for all the hurt that will cause other people, I really do, but it\u2019s not the most important thing.\u201d",
