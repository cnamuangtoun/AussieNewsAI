        "text": "Australia Post stamp price hikes of up to 60c per letter can be expected from next month after the national consumer watchdog announced it would not oppose the changes.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) today said it will not object to Australia Post's 13.3 per cent price increase, which is now slated to take effect from July 17.\n\nUnder the new price system, basic postage rates will rise from $1.50 to $1.70 for small letters, from $3 to $3.40 for ordinary large letters (weighing up to 125g) and $4.50 to $5.10 for the largest letters (up to 250g).\n\nThe cost of a stamp is going up. (Australia Post)\n\nThe price of concession stamps and seasonal greeting cards won't change.\n\n\"We understand that these price increases will mean extra costs for consumers. However, our decision to not object to Australia Post's proposed price increase is based on evidence that the costs to Australia Post of providing the letter service are greater than the revenue it produces,\" ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.\n\nBrakey said Australia Post has incurred \"significant losses\" on its letter services over the past few years.\n\nOn average, the national postal service only delivers around two letters per household each week.\n\nLetter volumes are also expected to plummet by another 10.6 per cent until 2028.\n\nThe ACCC has found it unlikely that Australia Post will recover its letter revenue, even with the proposed price increase.\n\nAustralia Post makes a loss on its letter services. (Getty)\n\n\"Our final decision recommends Australia Post examine ways to alleviate affordability issues for businesses, including those subject to requirements to send physical mail,\" Brakey added.\n\n\"Further we made recommendations to address a number of other concerns expressed by stakeholders during consultation.\n\n\"We are especially mindful of the impact price changes can have on vulnerable Australians, and so our decision paper recommends that Australia Post increases the number of concession stamps per customer, which is currently capped at 50 per year.\"\n\nBrakey noted the price increase of $1.70 for a single postage stamp is still below the median price of $1.93 for private postal operators.\n\nAustralia Post first proposed the price hike in November last year.\n\nWhile the consumer watchdog did not have the authority to approve the proposed increases, it can object to the plan.\n\nUnless rejected by the federal minister for communications, stamp prices are expected to increase from July 17.",

        "text": "The American economy faces the unwelcome prospect of reignited inflation after the US launched strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran .\n\nHigh oil and petrol prices are a near certainty, experts say. The big question now: how long will the fossil fuels price spike last?\n\nOil prices are expected to rise by about $US5 ($7.72) a barrel when markets open on Sunday night local time, according to experts.\n\nAn oil tanker is loaded at Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura oil refinery and oil terminal in Saudi Arabia. (Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters/File via CNN)\n\n\"We are looking at $US80 oil on the open,\" said Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates.\n\nUS oil hasn't closed above $US80 a barrel since January and has largely hovered between $US60 and $US75 a barrel since August 2024.\n\nRelatively tame oil prices have lowered petrol prices to below $US3 a gallon (about $1.22 a litre) in many parts of the country, a major source of price relief for inflation-weary consumers.\n\nIt's unclear if any major spike in oil prices will be sustained for a long period. Oil prices have risen about 10 per cent since Israel's surprise attack on June 13 and then fell on Friday after US President Donald Trump announced a two-week deadline on whether to strike Iran.\n\nOil tankers have in the past been attacked in the Strait of Hormuz. (AAP)\n\n\"One shouldn't necessarily assume that just because the price of oil goes up, it's going to stay there. It doesn't,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for the accounting firm RSM.\n\nThe direction oil prices take is likely to depend on whether Iran's parliament decides to block the Strait of Hormuz, a key trade route that accounts for about 20 per cent of the world's crude oil.\n\nOn Sunday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country had \"a variety of options\" when deciding on how to respond to the US attacks; and a prominent adviser to Iran's supreme leader has already called for the closure of the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThis satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows the Fordow enrichment facility in Iran after the US strikes. (Maxar Technologies)\n\nBob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and former energy adviser to president George W Bush, said that should Iran cut off the world's oil supply by closing the strait, it would risk more military force from the US and its allies.\n\nIran could also attack infrastructure in the Persian Gulf that treated and exported oil and gas.\n\n\"It's possible they will decide the only thing that can dissuade President Trump is the fear of an oil price spike,\" he said.\n\n\"They have to actually create that fear.\"\n\nAppearing on Fox News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, adding that closing it would do more damage to other economies than the US economy. China buys a third of all oil that comes from the Persian Gulf, while the US buys less than 3 per cent.\n\nMan kicked out over $200 sets Queensland hostel fire that kills 15 View Gallery\n\n\"I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio added that closing the strait would hurt other countries' economies more than the US economy.\n\nMeanwhile, American consumers may soon feel a price shock at the pump.\n\n\"It takes five days or so for stations to pass along the prices they see in one day. If oil markets do surge today and then tomorrow, it could start showing up at the pump in a matter of hours,\" said Patrick De Haan, vice president of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a fuel tracking platform.\n\nAccording to Lipow, should the Strait of Hormuz be affected, the price of oil could rise to $US100 ($154.50) a barrel, which would raise petrol and diesel prices by about US75 cents a gallon (about 29c a litre) from recent levels.\n\nMeanwhile, US trade policies combined with the Israel-Iran conflict \"strongly suggest inflation will be moving faster and higher over the next 90 days,\" according to Brusuelas. Many mainstream economists argue that the low inflation of the spring represents a calm before the summer storm, when they expect prices to rise because of Trump's tariffs.",

        "text": "When he was writing young adult novels, West Australian author Holden Sheppard hid himself in his fiction, splitting his personality and past across different characters.\n\nIt was an act of self-protection, he tells ABC Arts.\n\n\"It was like the sniper couldn't get me because he couldn't work out which one was me.\"\n\nBut Sheppard isn't hiding any more.\n\nHis new book, King of Dirt, his third \u2014 and first for adults \u2014 features a narrator that's unapologetically based on himself.\n\n'Sliding doors version' of the author\n\nLike Sheppard, King of Dirt's protagonist Jack Brollo is an Italian-Australian gay man who grew up in the town of Geraldton. Both have worked construction jobs, love the Collingwood Magpies and a bourbon, and drive a hotted-up Holden SS ute they call 'Phantom'.\n\nSheppard says \"the world has kind of told me to be a certain way\" \u2014 something his writing has pushed back on. (Supplied)\n\nYet the author says Jack \u2014 who we first meet as a self-destructive loner prone to fighting and binge-drinking \u2014 is a \"sliding doors version\" of himself, a vision of how he could have turned out without the \"love and support\" of his family.\n\n\"If I hadn't come to terms with my sexuality when I was about 20, had stayed in the closet, kept working in Geraldton as a labourer with my dad, and had stayed with women instead of hooking up with guys, then Jack is probably where I would have ended up in my mid-30s,\" Sheppard explains.\n\n\"But he's a bit tougher than me,\" he laughs. \"I think he might beat me in a fight if it came to it. I'm pretty tough, but he's a bit more of a brawler.\"\n\nAn emotionally charged homecoming\n\nIn King of Dirt, Jack is estranged from his family, who rejected him when he was outed as gay in his late teens.\n\nVowing to keep \"hundreds of kilometres between me and Gerro\", he spends years working in short-term remote construction jobs. Then, one day, Rocco \u2014 Jack's second cousin and his former best mate \u2014 sends him a wedding invitation, bringing him back to his home town.\n\nThere, he confronts the ghosts of his past, including Brick, an old basketball teammate who he was once madly in love with.\n\nListen: ABC Radio National's The Bookshelf Photo shows man with shaved head, beard and moustache sits in a football locked room with arms crossed Kate Evans and Cassie McCullagh discuss Holden Sheppard's King of Dirt, a vibrant gay coming-of-age story set in Geraldton.\n\nBrick is now working as a personal trainer and brings Jack into his world, helping to build his confidence and improve his mental health at the gym.\n\nSheppard says he is irked by how gym culture is often depicted negatively.\n\n\"The gym is something I found in my 20s, and I loved it so much.\n\n\"A lot of people's perception of the gym is rooted in high school locker rooms and how much the jocks were bullies. But gyms are not like that; they're actually super positive. If you're lifting for the first time, you will find nothing but encouragement.\"\n\nEmbracing 'bogan'\n\nSheppard describes The King of Dirt as \"a gay bogan love story\" but he was initially reluctant to embrace the bogan tag.\n\n\"The funny thing is I never thought of myself as a bogan when I was in Geraldton at all. I just thought I was a normal Aussie person.\"\n\nIn King of Dirt, Sheppard returns to the protagonist of his 2019 novel, Invisible Boys, which has been adapted into a six-part series for Stan. (Supplied)\n\nWhile studying literature at university, he was amazed to hear his lecturer describe Kath and Kim as a satire of bogan life.\n\n\"I just thought it was a funny show. I know all these people; that's the culture that I've grown up around,\" he says.\n\nAt university, he initially felt isolated from his artier classmates and wanted to quit.\n\nAfter a summer spent driving an earthmover for his father, he decided to return to university but vowed not to change for anyone.\n\n\"It was just embracing what I actually like, as opposed to what I thought I had to become to be a writer,\" he says. \"I wanted to be a writer but I also wanted to be myself.\"\n\nSheppard even featured as a bogan on ABC TV's You Can't Ask That.\n\n\"Embracing the bogan title has been actually really fun,\" he says.\n\n'A shame not many straight men will pick it up'\n\nSheppard says the transition from writing young adult fiction to adult literature has been freeing, allowing him to fully explore Jack's journey from repression to embracing his sexuality with frank sex scenes.\n\nGrowing up gay in a regional town Photo shows A teenage boy wearing a full-brimmed hat and a teenage boy with blue hair stand on a beach. Invisible Boys is an exploration of the hostile forces confronting four gay teenage boys in a small Australian town, and the very real question of whether they can survive them.\n\n\"There's so much gatekeeping in the young adult space, and frankly, I f***ing hated it,\" he says.\n\n\"It frustrated me a lot to have people [asking]: 'Is this appropriate?' You just want to scream. It's totally fine when it's a boy and a girl but, because it was two boys, it was not appropriate.\n\n\"Hearing that kind of language around your own teenage trauma is incredibly infuriating.\"\n\nSheppard says he didn't want to tone down the sex for straight readers.\n\nIt's a decision that's been vindicated by the positive feedback he's already received from straight men on King of Dirt.\n\nHe says some straight male readers have told him they think it's a shame many of their peers won't read it \"because it's a gay book\". These readers have enjoyed the coming-of-age element of the tale, particularly Jack's struggles with mental ill health, anger and suicide ideation.\n\n\"They could relate to being isolated, or being alienated from people you love. It's about family estrangement and male loneliness, which a lot of us go through, especially once we hit our 30s, whether you're gay, straight or bi,\" Sheppard says.\n\n\"There's a lot in there that straight men can relate to because it's really just about a bloke facing his demons and his past.\"\n\nKing of Dirt is published by Hardie Grant.",

The concept of home, though? That's a little more complicated.\n\nIn rubber-stamping herself as one of Australia's greatest golfers by claiming her third major at the Women's PGA Championship, one comment stood out as Lee paid tribute to her over-achieving family.\n\nMin Woo Lee in action at the Travelers Championship, 2,300km away from his sister's major victory. (Getty Images: Alex Goodlett)\n\n\"Wherever Min is, he's supporting me out there,\" Lee said of little brother and rising golfing star Min Woo Lee.\n\nSuch is the complicated and stacked nature of the men's and women's golfing calendar, these kind of achievements \u2014 so epic and history-making that it feels they should be played out surrounded by family \u2014 are instead completed not knowing exactly where in the world your only sibling is as you achieve them.\n\nFor what it's worth, Min Woo was in the final round of the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut, 2,300km away.\n\nThe same country. But a world away from the champagne showers and unbridled joy of his big sister's big moment.\n\nHaving just crawled towards a 63rd-placed finish, and with a microphone in his face and a sponsorship banner behind him, Min Woo sent the most sincere and warm message he possibly could from the most corporate and staged of settings.\n\nMin Woo Lee smiles after he says \"love you\" in a message to sister Minjee Lee. (Supplied: LGPA)\n\n\"I'm so proud of you,\" he said, having been prompted by the broadcasters to send the message.\n\n\"The last couple of years have been tough and I'm glad to see you back in the winner's circle.\n\n\"I'm proud of you and \u2026 ah \u2026 love you.\"\n\nOn the final two words, Min Woo's face beamed.\n\nNo doubt the private calls and texts and group chats had lit up with the more candid and fervent messages of inside jokes and gentle ribbing that can only come through that love language that we all have with our closest families and friends.\n\nBut in those two words, Min Woo's warmth towards his sister broke through the corporate barriers, a glimpse of home on a golf tour that so often lacks a true understanding of the concept, with an endless schedule and the constant battle to stay high enough in the rankings to make it all worth it.\n\nMinjee Lee reacts after being shown the video from her brother. (Supplied: NBC)\n\n\"That's so sweet,\" Minjee said when shown the video.\n\n\"We don't get to see each other too much, I feel like I see him more on social media than anything.\n\n\"I do miss him on the road. Just seeing that makes me a little bit emotional.\n\n\"It's just really nice to know that you have your family supporting you no matter where you are in the world, even if you're miles apart.\"\n\nThis is a tour of close calls, of heartbreak, and of missed opportunities, all of which Minjee has gone through since her previous major victory in 2022, with a capitulation in last year's US Open appearing to dent her growing confidence.\n\nAnd through it all, Min Woo has been there for her, even if via that tyranny of distance.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\n\"This will be Minjee's year,\" Min Woo told the ABC'S Australian Story in March last year.\n\n\"She'll get there, she'll get there.\"\n\nHe turned to his sister during the interview.\n\n\"Not you think you can,\" he said.\n\n\"You will.\"\n\nWith putter in hand, home is a tangible thing. Home is in the hole, then off to the next tee to find home again.\n\nOff the course, though, it's a concept that is much harder to pinpoint for those on the tour, one that differs from that which you and I understand, of our own bed at night, our place on the couch, a hot meal surrounded by our loved ones.\n\nHome is the next hotel at the next event. Home is in the clubhouse weighing up if all of this is worth it.\n\nBut home is also a message from your brother 2,300km away. Home is those final two words of that message and the beaming smile that comes with it.\n\nAnd home is living in the knowledge that even if you don't \"get there\", you'll always have a sibling who believes that you can.",

It's on those park benches where we see our neighbours and form our communities,\" he said.\n\n\" They play a really important social role. \"\n\nDr Croeser said it was generally rare to have enough green space in urban areas and highlighted the environmental benefits, from creating pockets of cool to absorbing excess stormwater during a flood.",

(ABC News)\n\nSimon Terry, the owner of Cobbold Gorge and the Goldfields Hotel in Forsayth, described the line as \"one of the most iconic rail journeys in Australia\".\n\nBut Forsayth station has not welcomed any passengers since the end of 2023, when an old wooden rail bridge was destroyed.\n\nMr Terry said the tiny towns depended on visitors to help \"dollars flow through\".\n\n\"The train has always been a great backstop for tourism in the region and to just wipe it off the itinerary is devastating,\" he said.\n\nThe beginning and end points of the Savannahlander route are closed.

(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)\n\nWith its Cairns base cut off, Savannahlander operators had to set up a temporary maintenance workshop inland at Mount Surprise, where extensive maintenance is more difficult and expensive.\n\nThe Savannahlander operating contract is up for extension at the end of this year and negotiations for a new deal between Cairns Kuranda and Queensland Rail are underway.\n\n\"I would be quite prepared to keep this service running for another 12 months, even if we had to remain isolated from Cairns, because I do understand there's a lot of expense involved in the bridges between Kuranda and Koah,\" Mr Lee said.\n\n\" But it's not a long-term sustainable thing as far as maintenance of the rail motors go. \"\n\nThe Savannahlander engine needed to be hauled up the Kuranda Range by truck to operate from Mareeba. (Supplied: Cairns Kuranda Steam)\n\n'State of limbo'\n\nSavannahlander driver Wil Kemp said he felt like he was \"in a state of limbo\".\n\nHe said the Savannahlander generated employment and helped keep families in the small towns it passed through.\n\n\"If you just look at [the cost of repairs] on paper, it probably doesn't make sense,\" Mr Kemp said.\n\n\" But when you see the communities out here and you get a bit of a sense of how much this train means to them, it does start to make sense. \"\n\nThe Savannahlander used to travel through the scenic Kuranda range. (Supplied: Cairns Kuranda Steam)\n\nMr Terry said having sections of the line closed made it difficult to develop tourism packages.\n\nMr Lee said he would like to see repairs to the Copperfield River bridge prioritised to allow the train to cross the spectacular Newcastle Range and get to within 15 minutes of Forsayth.\n\nTourist numbers have dropped slightly and coaches have replaced the train for parts of the journey.\n\n\"One thing we have received, though, is some positive feedback from some people that you might say almost reluctantly did the trip despite the road transport legs,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nQueensland Rail says it spends millions maintaining the line every year. (Supplied: Cairns Kuranda Steam)\n\nThe Savannahlander, now in its 30th year, is the only train that operates between Kuranda and Forsayth.\n\n\"However, Queensland Rail continues to support their operations with a $4.5-million investment in the maintenance of the Mareeba to Forsayth section each year,\" Queensland Rail regional network head Scott Cornish said.",

        "text": "Rheban Farm, a spectacular slice of Tasmania's east coast with 10 kilometres of private beaches, has just sold for about $15 million.\n\nIt is one of three major rural properties in the region to change hands in recent months. And, in a promising sign for the local market, all three sales have been to Tasmanians.\n\n\"The stand-out for us is that it's Tasmanians buying Tasmanian,\" Elders state rural property manager Lachie Dornauf said.\n\n\" These buyers are investing for the lifestyle and beauty, not just the agriculture. \"\n\nRheban Farm includes a 10 kilometre stretch of coastline. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nThe new owner of Rheban is Hobart City Councillor and former State Cinema owner, John Kelly. For him, the connection to the farm runs deep.\n\n\"Five generations ago, my great-great-grandfather came from Dublin as a convict,\" Mr Kelly said.\n\n\"He served time on Maria Island, just five kilometres across the water from here, working a farm at Long Point. He spent about three or four years there.\"\n\nNow Mr Kelly owns the land across the picturesque waterway from where his ancestor once toiled.\n\n\"To be here with Mercury Passage, Maria Island as the backdrop, heritage buildings, honestly, it doesn't get much better,\" he said.\n\nJohn Kelly says the options for Rheban Farm \"are incredible\". (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\n\"Can you possibly imagine him looking over here one day when he's working in the fields, thinking that my great-great-great grandson will have a farm over there? I mean, the synergy of it's quite remarkable really.\"\n\nMr Kelly, while admitting he was \"no farmer\" is keen to re-introduce some livestock on the property.\n\nHe said he was also keen to rejuvenate the land and look at regenerative agriculture, as well as agritourism projects.\n\nRheban Farm includes a number of heritage buildings. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nBut it's early days \u2014 Mr Kelly only took over the property a month ago.\n\n\"I want to kick the dirt, smell the breeze and look at my options because the options are incredible.\n\n\"There's work to be done, but the bones of the property and the buildings \u2014 there's a lot of old heritage buildings on here as well. It's just fantastic,\" he said.\n\nMedian farmland prices in Tasmania have been increasing. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nWhile Rheban is a lifestyle property, Tasmania is still a serious player in productive agriculture.\n\nMedian farmland values in the state have climbed to $23,202 per hectare, and to $27,019 in the state's north-west, according to Bendigo Bank Agribusiness.\n\nBut those strong figures are largely driven by smaller rural parcels under 40 hectares, which attract premium prices. Larger properties are taking longer to sell, and their values have dipped slightly since the highs of 2022.\n\nJohn Kelly took over Rheban Farm a month ago. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\n\"Things have levelled out,\" Mr Dornauf said.\n\n\"But what's growing is national interest. Inquiries from interstate buyers, particularly from South Australia and Victoria, are up 34 per cent in the past year. That reflects how tough the seasons have been over there.\"\n\nMr Dornauf said some of those buyers were syndicates, aiming to spread risk across diverse operations. Water security and climate stability make Tasmania an appealing hedge.\n\n\"When farmers invest interstate, they want to de-risk. Tasmania's water supply helps ensure more consistent returns, whether it's cropping or grazing,\" he said.\n\nOne of the buildings on Rheban Farm on Tasmania's east coast. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nStill, even the best farms are taking longer to sell.\n\n\"There's a bit of hesitation,\" Bendigo Bank's Tony Anderson said.\n\n\" Buyers are waiting to see if conditions improve, so days on market are increasing across most property types. \"\n\nWith demand for dairy land rising above others, the next big parcel of land that may sell soon is in Tasmania's north-east.\n\nThe sprawling 22,000-hectare property Rushy Lagoon on the state's north-eastern tip has been on the market for 12 months.\n\nIt's believed prospective buyers are conducting due diligence on the land, which has a dairy as well as sheep and beef operations and irrigation.\n\nAll eyes will be on the price it fetches.",

        "text": "India led England by 96 runs on the second innings after three riveting days of their test series opener at Headingley overnight.\n\nIndia bowled out the host for 465 at tea to eke out a six-run first-innings lead, and was 2-90 in its second innings when rain stopped play a half-hour early.\n\nOpener Lokesh Rahul was 47 not out with captain Shubman Gill beside him on 6.\n\nHarry Brook led England's batting spree on the day, riding his luck from 0 to 99 until he was out hooking straight to the fielder at deep backward square leg.\n\nHarry Brook puts his hand to his head in despair as Prasidh Krishna celebrates the wicket. (Getty Images: Visionhaus)\n\nBrook was in control of partnerships of 51 with Ben Stokes, 73 with Jamie Smith, and 49 with Chris Woakes. But when he was out at 7-398 England trailed by 73 runs and India would have expected to wrap up the tail with the new ball only five overs old.\n\nBut fast bowling all-rounder Woakes and number nine batter Brydon Carse smashed 55 runs off 44 balls and India needed to give star pacer Jasprit Bumrah a back-breaking fifth spell to mop up.\n\nBumrah took the final two wickets for 5-83, his 12th five-for away from home, tying Kapil Dev's India record.\n\n\"The game is in the balance,\" Bumrah said.\n\n\"We have to bat well. The wicket is a little bit two-paced so it will be an interesting game to come.\"\n\nOllie Pope's unbeaten 100 underpinned England's reply on Saturday but he added only six runs on Sunday before he tried to cut a nothing ball from Prasidh Krishna.\n\nStokes came in and Brook allowed the captain to settle by counterattacking India on his county home ground. Brook charged at Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj for boundaries, drove Krishna on the up, and even pulled off a Rishabh Pant-type falling ramp shot for four that Pant smiled at.\n\nBrook had the most trouble with Ravindra Jadeja's spin. Jadeja was getting the ball to fizz so well that he got Brook's outside edge on 46 but Pant dropped a tough chance at the stumps.\n\nBrook was soon celebrating his 20th fifty-plus score in his 26th test.\n\nStokes was at the crease for nearly an hour for 20 when he feathered Siraj behind.\n\nSmith lasted until just after lunch when he attempted a second six in the last over before the new ball became available. He fell into Krishna's short ball trap, caught deep by Jadeja who, just before he stepped over the boundary, relayed the ball to Sai Sudharsan. Smith made 40 off 52.\n\nWhen Brook was dropped on 82 by slip fielder Yashasvi Jaiswal off Bumrah, it was Jaiswal's second drop of a Bumrah delivery and India's fourth, its most in a test match in five years.\n\nBumrah took up his station on the boundary each time with a smile.\n\n\"I like to enjoy my time on the field so I always smile,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody is dropping catches purposely and sometimes the cold makes it difficult to catch. I try not to let if affect me and move forwards quickly.\"\n\nAfter 11 boundaries and two sixes by Brook, the crowd anticipated his first Headingley test century until he pulled Krishna straight to Shardul Thakur on the boundary. Brook hung his head back in disbelief.\n\nAs unlucky as Brook was on 99, he was lucky to have scored one run. Before he got off the mark, he was caught in Saturday's last over but Bumrah overstepped. Then he was dropped on 46 and 82.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nWoakes and Carse prevented India from gaining a sizeable lead by feasting on Siraj and Krishna. Carse was bowled by Siraj on 22 off 23 balls in his first home test. Woakes was bowled by Bumrah on 38, his best test score in a year.\n\nBumrah's 14th five-for in his 46th test put him in the company of Imran Khan, Richard Hadlee, Ian Botham, Dale Steyn, Dennis Lillee and Waqar Younis.\n\nBumrah finally had support from Siraj and Krishna, who took the other five wickets, but they and Thakur were expensive. England on Sunday scored at 4.9 an over.\n\nWhen India started batting, conditions were turning. Gloom forced on the stadium lights and the wind picked up. Rain came as expected.\n\nAfter Jaiswal, the first-innings century-maker, was nipped out by Carse for 4, Rahul and Sudharsan impressively handled the tricky conditions for more than 17 overs.\n\nSudharsan was dropped on 24 by Ben Duckett at backward point, but the damage was minimal as he reached 30 when Stokes got him for the second time in the match.\n\n\"The way Rahul played tonight, getting him out tomorrow is going to be crucial,\" Pope said.\n\n\"We back ourselves to chase a steady score.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC Gippsland: Danielle Pope)\n\nFor Vicki Hamilton, the CEO and secretary of the Asbestos Council of Victoria (better known as GARDS), the ongoing legacy of illness for the Latrobe Valley hits close to home.\n\nMs Hamilton lost both her father and grandfather to asbestos-related disease, and said despite the high profile nature of asbestos cases, many people mistakenly believed the challenges were behind them.\n\n\"I get a couple of calls a month at least from people who know that they're sick and they are going to see a doctor,\" she said.\n\nMs Hamilton said 140,000 workers were exposed to asbestos between the 1920s and the 1980s.\n\n\"That affected a whole community, and every person, every second or third person in the Latrobe Valley knows somebody who has an asbestos-related disease,\" she said.\n\n\" We might have banned it 20 years ago, but we've got 6.5 million tonnes in the community still there and it's all well past its use-by date. \"\n\nA wall-hanging inside GARDS Vic shows the names of members who have died from asbestos-related diseases.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAlcaraz had more in his locker, though, and forged 4-1 ahead in the decider as Lehecka's level finally began to drop on a breezy Andy Murray Arena in west London.\n\nHe then broke the 23-year-old Lehecka's serve again to complete victory, letting out a roar of delight as Lehecka struck a backhand into the net.\n\nWhile Alcaraz will be seeded number two at Wimbledon behind Jannik Sinner as he bids for a hat-trick of titles there, he will arrive in red-hot form and as the overwhelming favourite.\n\nHe has won 27 of his 28 matches since April, his lone loss coming against Holger Rune in the Barcelona final, and Sunday's win was his fifth title this year.\n\n\"This is really special this trophy and this tournament for me,\" Alcaraz said on court as he clutched the huge piece of silverware.\n\n\"Jiri had an incredible week and his level is very high and it's a nightmare to play against you.\"\n\nLehecka, whose ball-striking and physique are not dissimilar to Lendl's, beat home favourite Jack Draper in the semifinals on Saturday and began full of confidence against Alcaraz whom he defeated at the start of the year in Doha.\n\nWith serve dominating on the slick lawn, there was nothing between the players until Lehecka made a couple of errors at 5-5 and Alcaraz needed no second invitation to take the set.\n\nWomen in Sport Spotlight We put the spotlight on women making a big impact on and off the field in the sporting world \u2014 from the grassroots through to the elite level.\n\nThe second set followed a similar pattern, but it was Lehecka who raised his game in the tiebreak to get a mini-break ahead.\n\nAlcaraz replied to win a sensational point at 3-4, sprinting to retrieve a drop shot and then back to chase down a lob.\n\nBut Lehecka did not flinch and banged down an ace. Alcaraz double-faulted at 5-5 and then Lehecka levelled the final.\n\nLehecka was unable to carry that momentum and Alcaraz quickly re-established control and surged to victory.\n\n\"The goal this week was just to compete and have a few matches on the grass and this final was a gift for me,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"I just enjoyed the moment and the final, I felt like I was in control most of the time.\"\n\nReuters",

        "text": "A South Australian council hopes a project worth up to $25 million to connect sewerage to 651 properties will attract more people to live in the area while addressing concerns about water potentially being contaminated with faeces.\n\nKingston South East has been moved to the top of the list for state government funding for an expanded sewerage system after advice from SA Health to the Kingston District Council about risks to public health and the environment from water being contaminated via aging and non-compliant septic systems.\n\nSome people use bores near neighbours' septic tanks for water in their houses and gardens that can then get contaminated with faeces, council chief executive Ian Hart said.\n\n\"There is an issue with potential groundwater contamination that could be even occurring now and there could be waterway impacts in the environment as well,\" Mr Hart said.\n\n\"The proximity of bores to people's drinking supply and other domestic supply is a real issue in Kingston.\"\n\nIan Hart says the project will boost the town's population. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nResidents to contribute to costs\n\nIf the project goes ahead, property owners where the new Community Wastewater Management System (CWMS) would be connected in the suburbs of Rosetown, Wyomi and Pinks Beach would have to pay a quarter of the cost of the new system, which the council estimates at $1,000 per property per year over 10 years.\n\nThe other three quarters of the money for the new sewerage system would come from the state government via a grant scheme administered by the Local Government Association of South Australia.\n\nPeople would have to pay extra for their block to be connected to the new system.\n\nResident Mark Lively estimated it could cost $23,000 to $28,000 per property, despite many of them already having functional septic systems.\n\n\"This CWMS is basically just being done so the council can get 20 or 30 properties added onto their rate base,\" he said.\n\nKingston resident Mark Lively has been active on social media opposing the new system. (Supplied)\n\nBenefits for development\n\nAbout 270 of the blocks affected are vacant.\n\nPeople who want to build a house on them now have to install holding tanks for their wastewater.\n\nLes Gullickson and his wife, Sharon, are building a house in Kingston that they hope to retire to.\n\nSeptic tanks and holding tanks have to be emptied regularly. (ABC News: Angelique Donnellan)\n\nThey found out about the cost of emptying holding tanks after starting their build.\n\n\"If they don't go ahead with the full sewerage and stuff like that, I think we'll be moving out of Kingston because we can't afford to [live here],\" Mr Gullickson said.\n\n\"If we have to pump it every two weeks, that's a rough estimate of $600 a month.\n\n\"Times that by 12 months in a year, that's quite a few dollars more than what a sewerage system would cost to run, and if we had known that we had to do this, I may not have gone ahead with the build.\"\n\nHelp for housing shortage\n\nMr Hart said the estimated costs were only \"indicative\" until more detailed plans for the system could be drawn up.\n\nHe said properties connected to the sewerage system would increase in value.\n\n\"This project will enable them to build with confidence, and that will help Kingston because it means our town will grow and it means there will be more housing available,\" he said.\n\n\"We know there is a housing shortage, and it will be good for our community.\"\n\nIan Hart says properties connected to the sewerage system will increase in value. (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)\n\nConsultation sessions on the project will be held this week, with a decision expected in the coming months.\n\nWork would start in mid-2026 and finish a year later.\n\nThe project will not include adding piped drinking water to Rosetown, Wyomi or Pinks Beach.\n\nResidential property owners in the Kingston District Council are facing a 9 per cent rate increase this year, with the council also having to deal with multi-million-dollar projects to fix the Kingston jetty and the Maria Creek boat ramp, as well as ongoing costs related to the Cape Jaffa marina.",

(ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nOn March 22, she was readmitted for a transition from a nasojejunal feeding tube to a nasogastric tube, before attending the emergency department with symptoms including vomiting, fever and agitation.\n\nLexie was again discharged on March 27, with a review scheduled for the following morning, but Ms Nowland became concerned during the night and rang the hospital.\n\nShe was advised to attend the review and arrived at about 7:30am.\n\n\"The deceased did not undergo clinical review by a paediatric consultant until approximately 1700 hours,\" the writ reads.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the writ says Lexie suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, but she again went into cardiac arrest two hours later and was pronounced dead at 7:25pm.\n\nMs Nowland claims Lexie's treatment \"fell below a reasonable standard of care\" through RDH's failure to \"properly assess, treat and manage\" her condition and to treat her for \"suspected sepsis, dehydration/fluid and electrolyte disturbance\".\n\nLexie died at Royal Darwin Hospital on March 28, almost 12 hours after she arrived on the ward. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nShe also claims the hospital \"failed to appreciate\" Lexie was a \"high-risk patient with complex needs\" and was \"at risk of acute deterioration\".\n\nShe says RDH also failed to advise her to attend the emergency department on the morning of Lexie's death and failed \"to recognise the parental concern in respect of [her] condition\".\n\n\"The defendant's negligence caused or materially contributed to the deceased's death,\" the document reads.\n\n\"By reason of the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff has suffered nervous shock and has and will continue to suffer injury, loss and damage, including psychiatric injury.\"\n\nThe NT government is yet to file a response to the claim.\n\nThe case is set to return to court for a directions hearing on July 2.",

        "text": "The surge in oil prices clearly has the potential to go much higher. So far, as appears to be the case with equities and bonds, there seems to be an assumption within the administration and among investors that America\u2019s entry to the conflict and its bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities represents a conclusion, at least of America\u2019s involvement, rather than a beginning. With Tehran saying that the bombings will trigger \u201ceverlasting consequences\u201d, however, that would be a premature assumption. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial shipping lane for the global economy. Credit: Getty Iran could respond with its own strikes on US targets in the region. It could also do what it has sometimes threatened, but never done, and close the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping lane from the Persian Gulf for nearly a third of the world\u2019s oil and 20 per cent of its LNG, either by mining it or by targeting tankers. That would send the oil price soaring above $US100 a barrel, with particular implications for China and Europe.\n\nWhere the US is energy self-sufficient, China and Europe rely on the Middle East for oil and oil-derived products. Europe, after ending its dependence on Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine, is now heavily dependent on LNG. China buys about a third of the oil that transits through the Persian Gulf and is the dominant customer for Iranian oil. Israel and the US have, so far, left Iran\u2019s oil export infrastructure, centred on its Kharg Island facility in the gulf, untouched. Loading An escalation in the conflict and disruption, or even a more direct threat of disruption to oil and LNG supplies, would boost inflation rates around the world. Already, the price of jet fuel has jumped nearly 50 per cent, which will eventually flow through to air fares. Energy shocks \u2013 and developments in the Middle East could easily produce a full-blown one \u2013 have historically had very material and long-lasting effects on advanced economies and their markets, although the global economy, and the US in particular, is much less reliant on oil today than it has been in the past.\n\nIt\u2019s also the case that a spike in the oil price would trigger a frenzy of drilling in the US \u2013 shale oil producers respond quickly to prices \u2013 which has become a net exporter of energy this decade, and would probably also see increased Russian production. If sustained, it would also accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy sources, a safety valve that didn\u2019t exist in the 1970s during the Arab oil embargo after the Yom Kippur War, when an Egyptian-led coalition of Arab states attacked Israel. That embargo ignited a dramatic increase in oil prices and years of stagflation (high levels of inflation with low levels of growth) in the major developed economies. Markets are full of risk, largely created by decisions made within the Trump White House. Credit: AP There\u2019s another potential source of stagflation that the major markets also appear to be discounting \u2013 Trump\u2019s trade war on the rest of the world.\n\nThere\u2019s already a range of tariffs in place \u2013 the 10 per cent universal baseline tariff and higher tariffs on some commodities and products \u2013 but the most threatening tariffs, the so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, won\u2019t be unveiled until July 9. With the average US tariff rate already multiples of what it was before Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d in April, the addition of extra country-specific rates could have a destructive impact on not just the US economy, where they would cause spikes in prices and supply shortages, but on the global economy. In what is still, despite Trump\u2019s efforts, a global economy, geopolitics ought to matter for investors and markets. The equity and bond markets have so far shrugged off that threat, believing that Trump will bluff and bluster but ultimately back off. The administration\u2019s bombing of Iran, however, may cause investors to question whether their conviction that \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d \u2013 the \u201cTACO\u201d trade \u2013 is soundly based. There\u2019s also the fate of the One Big Beautiful Bill that Republicans have been fighting over, a budget bill that would blow out America\u2019s already bloated government debt and deficits. Fiscal hawks within the party have been fighting a rearguard action to try to reduce the level of spending in the bill.\n\nThe divisions within the Republicans and relationships with the White House might be exacerbated by Trump\u2019s decision to plunge America into the fight between Israel and Iran. The isolationists within the party \u2013 and they are a significant faction \u2013 aren\u2019t happy and are saying so, loudly. Loading For the share and bond markets, the uncertainties generated by the conflict in the Middle East, the looming reciprocal tariff announcements, the fate of the US budget bill, the rifts appearing within the congressional Republicans and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s response to all those issues ought to provide reasons for caution. The Fed isn\u2019t going to give the markets the rate cuts they have been pricing in until it has a firmer grasp of the impact of the developments in the Middle East on oil and, therefore, gasoline prices and a clearer understanding of the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs. In what is still, despite Trump\u2019s efforts, a global economy, geopolitics ought to matter for investors and markets.",

        "text": "Aunty Jackie Huggins was at primary school in Brisbane in 1960s when a teacher singled her out in a moment that would radically change her perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bidjara and Birri Gubba Juru girl was the only Aboriginal student in her year three class when a fresh-faced young teacher told them to get to their feet if they were Australian.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on NITV\u2019s The Point, Aunty Jackie recalled her confusion when he had asked everyone except her to sit down and declared to the class that she was the \"real Australian\" in the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He based his whole class lesson around the fact that I was Aboriginal, and that I was here for a very long time, and we were the first peoples of this country, and it made me feel so proud,\" Aunty Jackie said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've always thought about that lesson and those lessons from teachers who have that incredible power to really affirm their children in the classroom, even if you are so different from the rest.\"\n\n\n\nThis formative classroom experience proved to be the exception rather than the rule and Aunty Jackie overcame bigotry and low expectations on the road to becoming an accomplished author and academic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I always say to teachers: 'You know, you have that power to really make or break a child's life in terms of their own identity',\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the data is clear that education is fundamental to improving outcomes for First Nations people, yet Indigenous students continue to lag behind the broader population.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Closing the Gap success stories are being written by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples: PM\n\nThe national agreement on Closing the Gap was launched in 2008 with the commitment to reduce disadvantage among Indigenous Australians in health, life expectancy, employment, and education by 2031.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the latest report, only one of the five education-related targets is considered to be on track.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Darwin University education researcher Dr Tracy Woodroffe said it\u2019s important to maintain a broader perspective on our national approach to education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Australian education system is meant to cater for all Australians,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of us thinking about Aboriginal people \u2014 us as people failing \u2014 we need to look at what's the responsibility of the system itself and to not position ourselves as helpless in the process, but think of how we change a system and how we change what teachers learn and how they operate within a classroom.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jaimee Leigh Wiley shares a story with her class at Cherbourg State School in Queensland. Credit: The Point Less than 2 per cent of registered teachers in Australia are Indigenous and Woodroffe said an \"infiltration\" of First Nations teachers and perspectives will help to transform the system from within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If more students had that positive experience of schooling, perhaps also then they might decide to be teachers themselves to teach the next generation the way that they wanted to be taught,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For that to happen, though, they need teachers to engage them in the first place and to be able to work in a way that helps the students feel like they belong within that school.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Belinda teaches Indigenous history in primary schools. She says it has helped reduce racism\n\nDespite Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures having been part of the national curriculum since 2012, the majority of non-Indigenous teachers over 35 say they 'lack confidence' in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a little bit of a cop-out,\" Woodroffe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's easy to say, \u2018I don't want to offend anyone. I don't know about that. I might get it wrong.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we're adults, and if we are setting out on this path to be educators, we should be educated and understand how to find the answer to something that we don't know.\"\n\n\n\nJackie Huggins (left) attended school in Inala in Brisbane in the 1960s. Credit: Jackie Huggins' book \u2018Auntie Rita\u2019 Aunty Jackie agreed that there is still a long way to go, but she has seen enormous change in her lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Who would've ever thought a little shy Black girl like me is now a professor?\" she said with a chuckle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've always said to younger people, you've got to have an education because that is about your liberation in this country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is the way we can fight to close the gap.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Point airs Tuesdays at 7.30pm on NITV, and is available after the broadcast on SBS On Demand .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2023, international student Amy - not her real name - thought she had found a secure job in Darwin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe then 30-year-old was hired as a student service officer, by vocational education provider International House Sydney, where she was studying for an Advanced Diploma in Program Management.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd unlike cash-in-hand casual jobs that many international students and new migrants often take, Amy felt secure with the position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a part-time permanent job, because I was on a student visa, so I could only work part-time, but it was a permanent contract.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in January 2025 the company went into liquidation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy's Australian colleagues were able to access the Australian government's Fair Entitlements Guarantee, or FEG.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guarantee allows people to claim back wages, redundancy payments and other entitlements after a company closes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut because Amy was an international student, she wasn't eligible for the scheme meaning that until today, she still hasn't been paid some wages or other entitlements after the company closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I thought that I would be more protected if I had a permanent contract. But then, when this happened, I realised that as an migrant, I do not have the same rights. I cannot access the same, yes, the same safety net as an Australian or a (permanent) resident.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to International House Sydney's liquidator, PKF Melbourne, the education provider had been trading at a loss from at least June 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time it went into administration, it had around 3,800 students and 318 staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy says they were informed by the liquidator that if funds remained after the liquidation, staff who couldn't access the FEG would be prioritised for repayment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News have put questions about follow-up payments with migrant staff to PKF Melbourne, but they didn't reply specifically to the question.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an issue facing many small and medium-size education providers after the federal government tightened international student enrolments last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFelix Pirie is the chief executive of Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We saw a big downturn for students to apply, to come or even consider lodging an application to come to Australia to undertake skills training courses but also English language programs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by the ITECA, in 2021 there are around 162,000 students enrolling in independent higher education providers with over half of them international students.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Pirie says the increased fees for visa applications and the slowdown of visa process hit his sector most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The outcome of these things is that independent providers are the ones singled out at the end of the day, or they are the one that certainly feels the biggest impacts, and it's the people they employ. So they employ significant workforce, and when their business start to suffer, those people lose their jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an international student finds their education provider goes into administration, they have the right to access the government's Tuition Protection Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis helps students find alternative course options and get a full refund from the provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Kunkel is the Chief Executive Officer of Migrant Workers Centre in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says many international students are also employed in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the other impact on this is for many migrant workers is that once they complete their education in Australia, many of them are moving into the education sector themselves, and in particular the international education sector. So for those workers who have come to build a life, to get an education and build a life in Australia, these international caps are putting pressure on jobs in the sector.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the then Coalition government released the final report from the government's Migrant Workers' Taskforce, which recommended an expansion of the FEG to all migrant workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Migrant Workers' Taskforce was established in 2016 to tackle migrant worker exploitation but since the 2019 report - the FEG has yet to be expanded.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025 the Albanese Labor government announced a consultation process looking into reforms to the FEG, after some businesses were found to have misused the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kunkel says the federal government needs to allow international students and migrant workers to access the FEG as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our visa system is built around this idea that international students are here just to study. But the reality is that many of those international students are here working and studying in Australia, and we need a visa system that allows those workers who are coming, those international students who are coming to Australia to be able to live a dignified life as they study and get that education.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeri Feldman-Gubbay is a senior solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also agrees that there's a gap between the safety net for local workers and international students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that the biggest thing is that a lot of Australian employing businesses rely on the fact that international students will be unfamiliar with the legal system and the rules in Australia. And so there will be, I guess, a false sense of confidence that is this employer is going to do right by me, when, in actual fact, a lot of employers take advantage of that lack of knowledge to then do the wrong thing and leave people in a really bad position.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd without the FEG scheme, Ms Feldman-Gubbay says for employees like Amy taking claims to court is one option.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy wants to see a change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I will ever be compensated, because I doubt there's money to be found, but I would really hope that in the future, nobody else has to go through this situation, or also for there to at least be something that is more talked about. I have not heard about this until it happened to me. I think that every migrant should know that this is something that could happen to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The surge in oil prices clearly has the potential to go much higher. So far, as appears to be the case with equities and bonds, there seems to be an assumption within the administration and among investors that America\u2019s entry to the conflict and its bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities represents a conclusion, at least of America\u2019s involvement, rather than a beginning. With Tehran saying that the bombings will trigger \u201ceverlasting consequences\u201d, however, that would be a premature assumption. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial shipping lane for the global economy. Credit: Getty Iran could respond with its own strikes on US targets in the region. It could also do what it has sometimes threatened, but never done, and close the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping lane from the Persian Gulf for nearly a third of the world\u2019s oil and 20 per cent of its LNG, either by mining it or by targeting tankers. That would send the oil price soaring above $US100 a barrel, with particular implications for China and Europe.\n\nWhere the US is energy self-sufficient, China and Europe rely on the Middle East for oil and oil-derived products. Europe, after ending its dependence on Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine, is now heavily dependent on LNG. China buys about a third of the oil that transits through the Persian Gulf and is the dominant customer for Iranian oil. Israel and the US have, so far, left Iran\u2019s oil export infrastructure, centred on its Kharg Island facility in the gulf, untouched. Loading An escalation in the conflict and disruption, or even a more direct threat of disruption to oil and LNG supplies, would boost inflation rates around the world. Already, the price of jet fuel has jumped nearly 50 per cent, which will eventually flow through to air fares. Energy shocks \u2013 and developments in the Middle East could easily produce a full-blown one \u2013 have historically had very material and long-lasting effects on advanced economies and their markets, although the global economy, and the US in particular, is much less reliant on oil today than it has been in the past.\n\nIt\u2019s also the case that a spike in the oil price would trigger a frenzy of drilling in the US \u2013 shale oil producers respond quickly to prices \u2013 which has become a net exporter of energy this decade, and would probably also see increased Russian production. If sustained, it would also accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy sources, a safety valve that didn\u2019t exist in the 1970s during the Arab oil embargo after the Yom Kippur War, when an Egyptian-led coalition of Arab states attacked Israel. That embargo ignited a dramatic increase in oil prices and years of stagflation (high levels of inflation with low levels of growth) in the major developed economies. Markets are full of risk, largely created by decisions made within the Trump White House. Credit: AP There\u2019s another potential source of stagflation that the major markets also appear to be discounting \u2013 Trump\u2019s trade war on the rest of the world.\n\nThere\u2019s already a range of tariffs in place \u2013 the 10 per cent universal baseline tariff and higher tariffs on some commodities and products \u2013 but the most threatening tariffs, the so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, won\u2019t be unveiled until July 9. With the average US tariff rate already multiples of what it was before Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d in April, the addition of extra country-specific rates could have a destructive impact on not just the US economy, where they would cause spikes in prices and supply shortages, but on the global economy. In what is still, despite Trump\u2019s efforts, a global economy, geopolitics ought to matter for investors and markets. The equity and bond markets have so far shrugged off that threat, believing that Trump will bluff and bluster but ultimately back off. The administration\u2019s bombing of Iran, however, may cause investors to question whether their conviction that \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d \u2013 the \u201cTACO\u201d trade \u2013 is soundly based. There\u2019s also the fate of the One Big Beautiful Bill that Republicans have been fighting over, a budget bill that would blow out America\u2019s already bloated government debt and deficits. Fiscal hawks within the party have been fighting a rearguard action to try to reduce the level of spending in the bill.\n\nThe divisions within the Republicans and relationships with the White House might be exacerbated by Trump\u2019s decision to plunge America into the fight between Israel and Iran. The isolationists within the party \u2013 and they are a significant faction \u2013 aren\u2019t happy and are saying so, loudly. Loading For the share and bond markets, the uncertainties generated by the conflict in the Middle East, the looming reciprocal tariff announcements, the fate of the US budget bill, the rifts appearing within the congressional Republicans and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s response to all those issues ought to provide reasons for caution. The Fed isn\u2019t going to give the markets the rate cuts they have been pricing in until it has a firmer grasp of the impact of the developments in the Middle East on oil and, therefore, gasoline prices and a clearer understanding of the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs. In what is still, despite Trump\u2019s efforts, a global economy, geopolitics ought to matter for investors and markets.",

So it's just a constant reassess.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"But at the moment I definitely want to play a home summer.

(John Davidson/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nForming a pathway to the ODI World Cup was part of Healy's pitch when she took over the captaincy when Meg Lanning retired in 2023.\n\n\"That was one of my goals, putting a timeline on it and saying this is where I could take this group, even not knowing what I was going to do personally,\" Healy said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It definitely was a big focus of mine, to get the group to a place to compete at this World Cup, and win the trophy.\n\n\"It's not so much about the captaincy (driving me), or ticking one more box.\n\n\"It's just that I want to win a World Cup for Australia, and no one has gone back-to-back, which is a real motivator.\"\n\nHealy has not kept wicket in a match since January, but is confident the three Australia A series and subsequent ODIs in India will have her fit for up to nine World Cup matches in 32 days.\n\nHealy aims to be back in her usual wicketkeeping role for the World Cup. (Linda Higginson/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"According to science, the ODI World Cups is one of the heaviest loads that we go through as cricketers,\" Healy said\n\n\"My aim is to play every game of that World Cup.

(Darren England/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nLomax said it was important not to become weighed down after the defeat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Week in week out, it's a rollercoaster of emotions. I guess like the first game, everyone was singing NSW's praises and game two, we lost. That's the way it goes,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why you can't buy into it too much.\"\n\nParramatta winger Lomax said it could be easy to fall into thinking it was he alone who cost NSW the game.\n\nIn reality, the Blues conceded eight unanswered penalties and completed at only 58 per cent as they fell 26-6 down at halftime.\n\nWhile critics may have pinned the loss on his kicking, Lomax said: \"It's easy to look at it that way because it (the margin) is two points and a goal is two points. For me, I pride myself on being a good goalkicker as well.\n\n\"It was not ideal. But as I said, it gives you guys (the media) something to talk about and the lead-in into game three.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The thing is, I probably couldn't have struck them any better.

(Jono Searle/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"I put it down to a lot of outside noise that said we couldn't do it, wouldn't make the top eight and weren't a finals team,\" Staggs said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We just flipped it all back onto them. We are fighting for one another. It was a good comeback.

Brisbane are seeking three wins in a row for just the second time this season.\n\nIf they replicate the final 26 minutes against the Sharks when they play the Warriors, the Broncos will be in a good position.\n\n\"The second half, we went out and just knew we had to stick to the game plan,\" Staggs said.\n\n\"They scored that early try in the second half and we looked at each other on the tryline and we just said, 'The only way we can get out of this is on our own'.\n\n\"We all went back to doing what we do best.
