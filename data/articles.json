(RENEE NOWYTARGER)\n\nSuch a cut will be welcomed by home owners who have been squeezed by the continuing hikes.\ufeff\n\nMoney.com.au has crunched the numbers to reveal how much Aussies could save on their monthly mortgage repayments.\n\nIf the 0.25 per cent July cut goes ahead as forecast, a borrower with a $600,000 mortgage could save an additional $90 a month, bringing their total monthly savings to $273 since the RBA began cutting rates.\n\nOwners with a $700,000 mortgage would save $106, while an extra $120 would be left in the bank for families with an $800,000 loan.\ufeff\n\nA borrower with a $1 million mortgage would save $150 a month from the July cut alone, bringing their total monthly savings to $456.\n\nThe savings are based on a starting home loan interest rate of 6.24 per cent, the average in February 2025, and a 25-year loan term.\n\nA borrower with a $1 million mortgage would save $150 a month from the July cut alone, bringing their total monthly savings to $456. (Peter Rae)\n\nMoney.com.au's Mortgage Expert, Debbie Hays, says a July rate cut would shift the dial for borrowers.\n\n\"Based on conversations we've had with borrowers, it's this third rate cut \u2014 the rule of three in action \u2014 that they believe will finally bring meaningful relief to their household budgets,\" Hays said\n\n\"After rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, and a sustained period of higher repayments, many are now watching closely to see if and when their lender passes on the cut in full,\" she says.\n\n\"It's an additional welcome boost at a time when people are receiving their tax returns \u2014 any extra breathing room in the budget is being gratefully received right now.\"\n\n\"For those still waiting to enter the property market, a third rate cut could boost their borrowing capacity by up to $50,000 \u2014 depending on the lender.\n\n\"While that might open the door to an extra bedroom or a more desirable suburb, it's also a double-edged sword, as it will fuel higher property prices and increased competition from other buyers with the same boost in borrowing power.\"",

The 36-year-old Supercars champion then backed up his first career Cup victory in the Second City in 2023 by doing it again.\n\n\"What an amazing weekend for me,\" said van Gisbergen, who led 26 laps and dominated the series last month on Mexico City's road layout. \"We made no mistakes, and there were some really fast cars.\"\n\nVan Gisbergen said the weather was a problem.\n\n\"It was just so hot this weekend,\" he said. \"The track was very slick, and the times were a lot slower. The margin for error was very tiny. Just had to get it right.\"\n\nChevrolet was first to the checkered flag for the third time in the past five races.\n\nGibbs posted a season-best finish with the runner-up showing in his black Toyota.\n\n\"I feel like I wasn't free enough to hit my points,\" the number 54 Joe Gibbs Racing driver said. \"We had a good day overall just need to be faster.\"\n\nFollowing Gibbs were Tyler Reddick, Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch.\n\nMichael McDowell led a race-high 31 laps but developed a stuck throttle midway through the race and finished 32nd.\n\nWith the entire Hendrick Motorsports stable starting at the rear of the 40-car field due to failed qualifying runs or repairs, four drivers holding play-off spots had to work to move through the field.\n\nAlex Bowman finished eighth, while Kyle Larson was 13th. Chase Elliott ended up 16th, and points leader William Byron came in last.\n\nIn what may have been NASCAR's final run in the Windy City's usually busy streets, race favourite van Gisbergen led the field from the pole position, but Row 1 starter McDowell snagged the lead in less than half a circuit.\n\nCarson Hocevar caused the first caution on Lap 4 when he bounced off the apron of Turn 10 and smacked the outside wall, coming to rest as seven cars, including Austin Dillon and Brad Keselowski, piled into Hocevar's number 77 car as it sat sideways against the outer barrier.\n\nWhile much of the field pitted, McDowell stayed on the 3.54 kilometre (2.2-mile) course, leading every circuit to beat Busch and Reddick for the top bonus points as Stage 1 ended at Lap 20.\n\nRyan Blaney put his number 12 Ford in position to claim 10 segment points as Stage 2 concluded on Lap 45. Briscoe, Reddick, Bowman and Bubba Wallace trailed the Team Penske driver.\n\nReuters",

You have no idea how I feel \u2014 thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" Osbourne said. \"You're all \u2026 special. Let's go crazy, come on.\"\n\nOsbourne performed several songs solo before being joined onstage, for the first time in 20 years, by Black Sabbath band mates Tony Iommi, Terence \"Geezer\" Butler and Bill Ward. The band ended a short set with Paranoid, one of their most famous songs.\n\nIt capped a day-long metal festival that included performances from the likes of Anthrax, Metallica and Guns N' Roses.\n\nFans around the world were able to join in on the celebration via a live stream that beamed the show into the homes of metalheads far and wide.\n\nEarly in the day, bands were given such short sets that they could play just one or two original songs, followed by a cover of an Ozzy Osbourne or Black Sabbath classic.\n\nAmong a cavalcade of highlights and guest appearances was a performance from a supergroup made up of heavy rock royalty including Billy Corgan, Sammy Hagar, Steven Tyler, Adam Jones, Vernon Reid, Tom Morello, Nuno Bettencourt, and a drum off between blink-182's Travis Barker, Red Hot Chili Peppers's Chad Smith, and Tool's Danny Carey.\n\nArtists who sent plaudits and well-wishes via video tributes included Jack Black, Dolly Parton, AC/DC, Cyndi Lauper, and Elton John.\n\n\" You are one of the most remarkable singers of our time,\" Elton John said. \"You are the king, you are the legend. \"\n\nActor Jason Momoa hosted the show, and didn't let that commitment stop him from getting amongst the action, jumping into the mosh pit at one stage to get the crowd riled up.\n\nOsbourne formed Black Sabbath in 1968 in Birmingham, a city then known for its heavy industry that became the crucible of the British metal scene.\n\nBlack Sabbath's devil imagery and thunderous sound made them one of the era's most influential \u2014 and parent-scaring \u2014 metal acts. Both the band and Osbourne as a solo artist have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nOsbourne's fame expanded into the mainstream in the early 2000s when he joined his wife Sharon Osbourne, and two of their children, in the MTV reality TV show The Osbournes.\n\nHe has struggled with health issues since 2003 following a near-fatal quad bike crash. He revealed his Parkinson's in 2020 and paused touring in 2023 after spinal surgery.\n\n- AP/ABC",

(Supplied: Sue Carroll)\n\nLighter, mobile medical technology\n\nMonash University's Design Health Collab is leading the design of the new CT scanners, alongside medical technology developer Micro-X and Johns Hopkins University in the United States.\n\nThe work is still in the early stages of development.\n\nThe team is designing the new scanners to be compact.\n\nTheir aim is a final weight of 225 kilograms \u2014 far less than conventional CT scanners that weigh 2 tonnes.\n\nThis means the technology could easily be fitted to smaller vehicles, unlike current mobile CT scanners that are installed onboard trucks.\n\nThe team hopes the system can also provide full-body scans and be used for general diagnostic imaging for things like abdominal pain, chest pain, head injuries, or neurological symptoms, cancer follow-ups, and trauma assessments.\n\nA visualisation of a new CT scanner in a vehicle. (Supplied: Monash University)\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the mobile scanners could be used in several ways, including on-call in a similar way to ambulances, or by moving through regional towns on a schedule to provide regular, routine opportunities for healthcare.\n\nMs Carroll said she would still opt to send patients to a hospital in emergencies, so they could receive surgery as soon as possible.\n\nBut she could see a use for the mobile CT scanners if they visited communities on a regular basis in a similar way to the breast screening bus, to help reduce wait times for patients needing preventative or diagnostic scans.\n\n\"That sort of thing would work, if you knew they were coming into the area \u2026 to be able to book ahead,\" Ms Carroll said.\n\n'Postcode lottery' of rural health\n\nFor now, the team behind the lightweight scanners has received a grant from the US Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), allowing the compact CT scanners to be built and rolled out across rural communities in the US from 2029.\n\nDesign Health Collab project lead Nyein Chan Aung hoped the technology could one day be roaming Australia's roads too.\n\nNyein Chan Aung is confident the CT scanners can be brought to Australia's roads. (Supplied: Monash University, James HH Morgan)\n\n\"We're actively seeking partners and funding sources for Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"While this project is US-focused, the tech and learnings are applicable to Australia as we also face geographic and access challenges.\n\n\"We will likely also need adaptations to the Australian context, to respond to nuances in Australian aged care, rural health, or possibly a combined response of diagnostic and emergency needs.\"\n\nDr Aung said the new technology could bring hospital-level medical imaging to underserviced areas, beating the \"postcode lottery\".\n\n\"When it comes to rural communities there's just not enough services out there,\" he said.\n\n\"Seven million Australians live in rural or remote areas, and \u2026 stroke patients outside the big city areas often have to wait three to six hours longer to receive any sort of imaging, which essentially reduces all chances of having a good recovery.\n\n\"I think this is a very effective solution to very quickly meet the needs of people who just aren't getting any help.\"\n\nDesigned to be used by generalists\n\nDr Aung added that just 15 per cent of radiologists and 17 per cent of medical imaging technologists operated outside metropolitan areas, making it even more difficult for rural Australians to access imaging.\n\nCrucially, clinicians without specialist imaging skills will be able to use the scanners.\n\nWhile they would receive some additional training, Dr Aung said the operators would be generalists.\n\n\"The thing we're working on is a complete rethinking of how the CT should be \u2014 we're rebuilding it,\" he said.\n\nSaving time\n\nRay Gallagher is president of the Omeo District Football Netball League, not far from Swifts Creek.\n\nHe said he had \"seen some bad knocks\" in his time at the league, with players taken away by ambulance after a rough game.\n\nRural life also comes with its risks.\n\n\"We've got a new bike track at Omeo, they have the rodeo up there, we have picnic races, skiers, dirt bike riders,\" he said.\n\n\"There are lots of people trying hard to hurt themselves.\"\n\nMr Gallagher also supported a mobile CT scanner for rural communities on a routine basis to save people from making long road trips for preventative care.\n\nHe would like to see them incorporated into heli-med services for emergency situations to get patients scanned and evaluated quickly.\n\n\"Anything that makes things safer for people in our area or any area is a good thing,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy has been contacted for comment.",

It's also the second time I'm rewarded with the yellow jersey as well, so I guess it was worth the wait.\"\n\nHe intends to wear yellow a little longer yet.\n\n\"I hope I can keep the jersey until the time trial [on Wednesday],\" Van der Poel said.\n\n\"[After that] it will be very hard.\"\n\nStage two was delayed by about 15 minutes after team buses arrived late to their parking spots because of heavy morning rain.\n\nFans lined the roads wearing raincoats and riders wore light jackets amid wet and blustery conditions on the slightly hilly 209 kilometre (130 mile) trek from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France.\n\nThe longest trek of this year's race featured about 4 kilometres of climbing suited to all-rounders like the three-time Paris-Roubaix classic winner Van der Poel and former cyclo-cross star Wout van Aert.\n\nGreasy roads increased the risk of spills and a strong headwind greeted riders approaching the finish as they took on the day's three consecutive climbs \u2014 short and sharp but very modest ones compared to the giant Alpine and Pyrenean ascents later in the three-week race.\n\nNone of the main Tour contenders could launch a decisive attack, although Vingegaard tried with 5 kilometres left.\n\nInstead, it was Van der Poel \u2014 nicknamed \"The Flying Dutchman\" \u2014 who surged clear and then withstood Poga\u010dar's late burst, having also beaten the Slovenian star at Paris-Roubaix in April.\n\nVan der Poel crossed the line in 4 hours, 45 minutes, 41 seconds with Poga\u010dar in second place and Vingegaard in third recording the same time.\n\nPoga\u010dar misjudged his attack, a rare mistake for him.\n\n\"Mathieu was stronger in the final sprint, so chapeau to him,\" Poga\u010dar said.\n\n\"To be honest I messed up a little bit, because I got a bit scared to sprint against him and I waited too long on his wheel.\"\n\nIn the overall standings, Poga\u010dar is four seconds behind Van der Poel.\n\nVingegaard is another two seconds back.\n\nJack Haig was the best of the Australians, finishing 31 seconds back in 36th.\n\nBen O'Connor remains the best-placed Australian overall, in 10th position, 41 seconds off the lead.\n\nFour-time Spanish Vuelta winner Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d \u2014 the 2020 Tour runner-up from Slovenia \u2014 and double Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel had both lost time on Saturday after being caught in a late crosswind.\n\nThey did not lose further time Sunday to Poga\u010dar and Vingegaard, who enters this year's Tour in better shape.\n\nLast year, the Dane had barely recovered from a heavy race crash in Spain that left him with a collapsed lung, several broken ribs and a broken collarbone.\n\nHe finished the Tour in second place but could not match Poga\u010dar in big climbs.\n\nThe 30-year-old Van der Poel was born in Belgium and shot to fame as a multiple cyclo-cross world champion before turning his sights to one-day classics and stage racing.\n\nCycling runs in the family.\n\nHis father Adri was also a cyclo-cross world champion and Van der Poel's maternal grandfather was the late French cyclist Raymond Poulidor.\n\nPoulidor took part in 14 Tours from 1962-76, finishing in second place overall three times and third five times.\n\nNicknamed \"Poupou\" and \"The Eternal Runner-up,\" Poulidor was adored by French fans.\n\nStage three is a flat stage for sprinters, 178.3 kilometres from Valenciennes to the coastal city of Dunkerque.\n\nThis race is entirely in France, with no stages held abroad as in previous years, and ends July 27 in Paris.\n\nAP/ABC",

        "text": "Wimbledon's move to electronic line calls has raised the ire of Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova after the Russian lost a key point because the system was \"deactivated\".\n\nA ball that clearly landed long in her Centre Court match against Sonay Kartal was not called out on Sunday because the electronic system that replaced line judges this year was shut off.\n\nAnd, because the replay review procedure that used to be in place also has been scrapped, the chair umpire called for a replay of the point at 4-all in the first set \u2014 much to the dismay of Pavlyuchenkova, the player who would have won the game if the proper call had been made originally.\n\nPavlyuchenkova wound up getting broken there to trail Britain's Kartal, but she eventually did manage to come back to win the match 7-6 (3), 6-4 and reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time since 2016.Wimbledon organisers have apologised after the electronic line-calling system on centre court was turned off in error and missed three calls in a single game.\n\nOrganisers have apologised to the players involved and say they continue to have full confidence in the accuracy of the technology. But on court, after the incident, Pavlyuchenkova was not happy.\n\n\"You took the game away from me,\" 2021 French Open runner-up Pavlyuchenkova told chair umpire Nico Helwerth at the changeover after the game ended.\n\nPavlyuchenkova, who is Russian, also said in the moment that the decision-making there went in Kartal's favour because she is a local player.\n\nAt her news conference, Pavlyuchenkova said Helwerth told her following the match that he did think Kartal's shot landed out.\n\n\"I think he felt bad, a little bit,\" Pavlyuchenkova said.\n\n\"He probably felt like he should have taken the initiative and called it out.\"\n\nShe also said Helwerth \"probably was scared to take such a big decision\".\n\nPavlyuchenkova was serving and had a game point when Kartal hit a backhand that landed beyond the opposite baseline, TV replays showed.\n\nBut there was no sound of one of the recorded voices being used for the first time at Wimbledon to reflect when the technology being used in place of human officials determines that a ball landed out.\n\nAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova missed out on a key point because the electronic line system was switched off. (Getty Images: Visionhaus)\n\nAt least Pavlyuchenkova could joke about the whole episode later.\n\nAsked how she would have felt about it had she lost the match, Pavlyuchenkova responded with a laugh: \"I would just say that I hate Wimbledon and never come back.\"\n\nShe also cracked that chair umpires are \"very good at giving fines and code violations\" and never miss those, but perhaps it would be beneficial if they did a better job of noticing mistaken calls.\n\nKartal said she couldn't see where her shot went.\n\n\"That situation is a rarity. I don't think it's really ever happened \u2014 if it has. It's tough. What can you do? The umpire's trying his best in that situation, and he handled it fine,\" Kartal said.\n\nThompson retires from Wimbledon mid-match with injury Photo shows Jordan Thompson of Australia leans on the net Australian Jordan Thompson retires from his round-of-16 match at Wimbledon against Taylor Fritz with a back injury, while Cruz Hewitt wins his first match in the Wimbledon junior singles.\n\n\"I think the system just malfunctioned a little bit, and the fairest way was what he did: replay the point.\"\n\nHelwerth delayed play while he made a phone call from his stand.\n\nEventually, play resumed, Pavlyuchenkova missed a forehand on the replay, then lost the game a few points later.\n\nThe explanation offered by an All England Club spokesman: \"Due to operator error, the system was deactivated on the point in question. The chair umpire followed the established process.\"\n\nThe French Open is now the only grand slam tournament that still uses line judges instead of electronic calls.\n\nFrom 2007 through last year, players were allowed to challenge in-or-out calls at Wimbledon; a video review was employed to decide whether a line judge's \u2014 or chair umpire's \u2014 ruling was correct.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThat challenge system was removed for the current tournament, but there immediately were demands on social media from some tennis fans or observers to bring that back to aid chair umpires.\n\nPavlyuchenkova agreed, saying: \"We should probably look into something else to have better decisions.\"\n\nVeteran Siegemund through to quarters\n\nMeanwhile seasoned German Laura Siegemund, the oldest woman left in the Wimbledon singles draw, ended the remarkable run of Argentine lucky loser Solana Sierra with a 6-3, 6-2 victory to storm into the quarterfinals.\n\nSiegemund's reward for her own heroics at the grass-court grand slam was a clash with top seed Aryna Sabalenka and the 37-year-old said she was heading into that match with a risk-free approach in the hope of reaching her first major semi-final.\n\n\"I haven't thought much about it yet. She's one of the greatest players that we have and one of the most aggressive also,\" Siegemund said.\n\n\"The only good thing about that match is that I have absolutely nothing to lose. But it's definitely one of the toughest opponents I think to have on grass.\"\n\nAP/Reuters",

        "text": "A key foreign-owned WA coal mine has fallen almost a billion dollars further into debt, even as the government prepares to pour more money into the insolvent company.\n\nGriffin Coal has been propped up by WA taxpayers since 2022 when the company was placed into receivership, amid fears its collapse could place the Perth and South-West electricity system at risk of blackouts and jeopardise hundreds of local jobs.\n\nThe company's biggest customer is Bluewaters Power \u2014 a coal-fired generator with capacity to supply about seven per cent of the grid's needs.\n\nAfter initially providing $40 million in support, the following year Premier Roger Cook announced a $220 million lifeline would be extended to Griffin Coal, describing it as payments \"we just need to make\".\n\nThis year's state budget contains provision for up to another $49 million for the company, taking the total bill to $308 million.\n\nThe Bluewaters facility is about five kilometres from Collie. (Supplied: Sumitomo)\n\n\"We just want the parties to sort themselves out so that they can get on and mine coal at a commercial rate, and that people can produce power at a commercial rate,\" Premier Roger Cook told budget estimates on Thursday.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the fact that the parties haven't been able to come to an agreement is a disgrace.\"\n\nShadow energy minister Steve Thomas didn't take to that argument kindly.\n\n\u2018A brutal solution\u2019: Premier defends propping up failing coal mine with $220m Photo shows Roger Cook likes sideways outside state parliament. The WA government has extended its financial support propping up the stricken Griffin Coal mine south of Perth to protect the state's electricity supplies.\n\n\"How dare the premier attack the two companies that have been left to pick up the pieces of years of government mismanagement,\" he said.\n\n\"The government's so-called solution to the problem is a joke because the price that Griffin Coal needs to become viable is the same price that bankrupts Bluewaters Power.\n\n\"If there was a commercial solution available, the government has had a decade to deliver it and save that $300 million.\"\n\nBluewaters' future is so uncertain as a result of those tensions that when the independent Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) published its 10-year outlook last week, it assumed Bluewaters would be unavailable from mid-2027.\n\nThe Griffin Coal mine near Collie. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nIt said that was due to the risk of Griffin being unable to supply coal once its government support ends.\n\nAEMO said while energy capacity would be \"largely balanced\" until mid-2027, \"there is a need for further investment\" beyond that point, in part because of the issues at Bluewaters.\n\n'No solution'\n\nThe depth of Griffin's difficulty was further highlighted in answer to questions asked by Dr Thomas, which show the company's debts have now reached $2.4 billion \u2014 some $800 million higher than a liquidator reported in 2022.\n\nMost of that debt \u2014 some $1.9 billion \u2014 is owed to ICICI Bank, India's biggest private bank.\n\nOther secured creditors are the Export Import Bank of India ($146 million), the Bank of Baroda ($144 million) and India Overseas Bank ($115 million).\n\nSteve Thomas says the situation came down to \"government mismanagement\". (ABC Great Southern: Mark Bennett)\n\n\"The government's put [more than] a quarter of a billion dollars into a company that will still be dead at the end of the process and taxpayers will be no better off,\" Dr Thomas said.\n\n\"That [money] should have refinanced and put new administration into Griffin Coal so that it could continue to supply Bluewaters, at least for the next 5-10 years.\n\n\"That would have been a better investment because it would have left the state with a viable asset at the end, rather than simply throwing a quarter of a billion dollars down a black hole that ultimately still results in the failure of the companies and the power system.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Griffin said: \u201cThe receivers and managers are actively engaging with customers, government, unions and other stakeholders on a commercial solution for Griffin Coal beyond 30 June 2026.\u201d\n\nDecisions need to made now\n\nIndependent corporate analyst Peter Strachan agreed that, in hindsight, it could have been better for the state government to have purchased Griffin when it was sold to its current owners.\n\n\"From the state's point of view it was a fraught deal because these are critical assets, critical to the state of Western Australia,\" he said.\n\nWith that option well and truly in the past though, Mr Strachan said pouring in money to keep it running was one of few options.\n\nThe clock is ticking as the 2030 coal phase-out commitment approaches. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)\n\n\"The state's got no option but to do that, or they could close it down and just import coal,\" he said \u2014 something the government did in late 2022.\n\nWith coal on its way out of the energy grid as the rise of renewables continues, Mr Strachan said time was of the essence.\n\n\"These are decisions that have to be made now, because if they're wanting to close the coal-fired power stations down by 2030, the clock is ticking,\" Mr Strachan said.\n\n2026 deadline\n\nDr Thomas's questions also revealed $13.5 million of the government's money had been paid directly to those secured creditors under a 'business continuation agreement'.\n\n\"The government's focus is on ensuring the continued operation of the mine to 30 June 2026,\" Mr Cook said in answer to those questions.\n\nBluewaters Power provides about seven per cent of the grid's needs. (ABC News: Kenith Png)\n\n\"The government entered into a business continuation agreement with the secured creditors and the receivers and managers to ensure the continued support of the secured creditors for this period.\n\n\"The [agreement] provides performance-based payments to the secured creditors, linked to the continued operation of the mine.\"\n\nMr Cook said those payments to secured creditors could reach $31.5 million by mid-2026.\n\nHe told estimates the current support regime would not continue beyond mid-2026.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook says the government won't be funding Griffin beyond next year. (ABC News: Kenith Png)\n\n\"If the parties related reach a commercial decision in relation to the way that the Griffin mine and the Bluewaters power station function, well then we'll consider any proposals from that point,\" Mr Cook said.\n\n\"But we've made it quite clear that we will not be funding the arrangements beyond the June 30, 2026.\"",

Around 5.5 million Australians live with disability, and it is estimated that neurodivergent folks make up between 15 and 20 per cent of Australia's population.\n\nThere is a lot of information on offer when your child is assessed for a neurodevelopmental disorder, but very little of it deals with how to help your child develop a positive identity and sense of self.\n\nUS Secretary of Health RFK Junior has told the world that \"autism destroys families\" and \"is an individual tragedy\".\n\nAutistic and ADHD folks often celebrate a diagnosis with cake, as my family did. (Supplied: Danielle Cahill)\n\nOur family ignored Kennedy's harmful words. We marked our daughter's diagnosis with a cake, as is customary in autistic culture.\n\nBut what can parents like me do to help our kids develop a healthy self-image? And how can their peers be encouraged to meet these differences with curiosity?\n\nHere's what's in Australia's new national autism strategy Photo shows A graphic showing a young boy looking up at an illustration of a brain England, the US and Canada are among the countries with national autism strategies \u2014 and now Australia has one too.\n\nFor younger children, experts say picture books about being neurodivergent can help develop a better understanding of their identity and a more positive sense of self.\n\nAll Brains Are Different, written and published by autism charity the Yellow Ladybugs, is the latest in a series of Australian picture books about neurodivergence.\n\nOther recent children's titles on the topic include Bernie Thinks in Boxes by Jess Horn, The Rainbow Brain by Sandhya Menon and Love Me, Love My ADHD by Chrissie Davies.\n\nThe real power of picture books about neurodivergence is when they are read by neurotypical children who directly learn and engage with difference via reading, according to clinical psychologist Professor Adam Guastella.\n\n\"If picture books can increase education to children about what it means to have different brains, it encourages a more inclusive and accepting schoolyard,\" he says.\n\nHaving to focus on deficits\n\nWhat often complicates the development of a positive sense of self for neurodivergent children is that, in order to obtain support through school, focus is often on a child's deficits.\n\n\"And these systems that are set up are constantly asking us to tell them what our kids can't do and so we get into a system where we are constantly emphasising their needs, the problems, the things they can't do, as a way to get support,\" Professor Guastella says.\n\nProfessor Guastella says receiving support is often predicated on a deficits-based diagnosis. (ABC News: Jade Macmillan)\n\nHis work includes developing assessments for neurodevelopmental conditions like autism to include looking at a child's strengths as well as their diagnosis.\n\n\"There's no reason why we shouldn't have a narrative that includes both and is also truly reflective of the reality of the situation for each child.\n\n\"But we have got into a habit, and it's a habit that's been generated by the systems of constantly focusing on the deficits,\" he said.\n\nYellow Ladybugs CEO Katie Koullas, who is one of the authors of All Brains Are Different, says she hopes neurodivergent children and their families feel seen on the pages of her book, which she believes can help neutralise the current polarising public discussions around neurodivergence.\n\n\"We're trying to change that script and say, 'Actually, there's a world that we can create that will celebrate all difference.'

(Joanne Flessas from Venus & Rose Photography)\n\nRepresentation is crucial to fostering empathy and understanding, according to Gumbaynggirr woman Dr Lilly Brown who is CEO of the Indigenous publishing house Magabala.\n\nShe said, for Indigenous Australians, \"So much of the negative and inaccurate representation is really based on the dehumanisation of First Nations people.\n\n\"I'm sure a lot of neurodivergent folks understand this as well.\"\n\nLilly Brown says it's important for Indigenous Australian children to see themselves in picture books.

        "text": "A former underground coal miner who escaped a major explosion and watched his colleagues emerge severely burnt is suing Anglo Coal for more than $1 million in damages.\n\nRyan Martin was working as a supervisor at Grosvenor Coal Mine near Moranbah in central Queensland in May 2020 when an underground methane gas explosion seriously injured five workers.\n\nThe 35-year-old has filed a claim for compensation in the Supreme Court in Rockhampton against the mine's operator, Anglo Coal, for his suffering of post-traumatic stress disorder after two separate blasts at the same mine in four years.\n\nMr Martin was also working underground when an evacuation was ordered due to a \"shock wave\" incident a month after the initial blast.\n\nRyan Martin has lodged a claim for damages against Anglo Coal. (Supplied: Ryan Martin)\n\nDuring the first explosion he saw his colleagues with melted helmets screaming in pain and helped by filling up bottles of water to pour over them.\n\nHe said it was \"extremely confronting\" and \"ingrained\" in his head.\n\n\"I've never seen burns that severe before \u2026 to the point of nearly a full body burn,\" Mr Martin said.\n\n\"Their face was not their face anymore. Hands, back, chest, the whole lot.\n\n\" One of the blokes had clothes nearly burnt completely off him. To see all that, it's a sight and smell very hard to get out of your head. \"\n\nFive workers were seriously injured in the explosion at Grosvenor Coal Mine in May 2020. (ABC News: Jemima Burt)\n\nAn inquiry into the incident found the mine's gas drainage systems could not cope with the rate of production and coal mine workers were repeatedly subject to an unacceptable level of risk.\n\nMr Martin alleges management pressured him to go back to work underground in the following weeks until another evacuation was ordered a month later when a shock wave went through the pit.\n\n\"I feel like they did put production over safety,\" he said.\n\nThis painting of the five injured Grosvenor workers by an unknown artist hangs in the Moranbah hospital. (Supplied: Mackay Hospital and Health Service)\n\nFollowing a second explosion at the same mine last year Mr Martin decided to leave the industry permanently.\n\nHe was on shift at the time but not underground.\n\n\"That was definitely the straw that broke the camel's back in aiding my decision to end up pulling the pin from the mining industry,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not that I don't want to, I don't think I can.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nMr Martin said he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression, anxiety, and has regular appointments with a psychiatrist and psychologist.\n\n\"It's been tough. The nightmares were at the start. My sleep, it's basically non-existent now,\" he said.\n\nMr Martin's lawyer Paul Zapata said Anglo should have learnt from its mistakes in 2020 and described the latest explosion as \"gobsmacking\".\n\nPaul Zapata says his client didn't feel safe returning to work following the latest mine explosion last year. (Supplied: Shine Lawyers)\n\n\"To see it happen again, some four years later, it was just enough for Ryan to lose complete faith and trust that he was going to be safe,\" Mr Zapata said.\n\n\"Predominantly [the claim] is about his income loss in the future. He's going to have to try and now reinvent himself.\n\n\"Underground mining is very dangerous and the safety of workers should be paramount.\"\n\nMr Martin has worked at mines in the Bowen Basin since he was 18 and is now pursuing certifications to work on civil construction sites.\n\nRyan Martin says he suffers post traumatic stress disorder, severe depression and anxiety following the explosions. (Supplied: Ryan Martin)\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Anglo American said the company was unable to comment on individual cases due to legal and privacy considerations.\n\n\"The health, safety and wellbeing of workers is always top priority,\" they said.\n\n\"We take that responsibility seriously and we are committed to ensuring a safe and supportive working environment for our people.\"",

        "text": "So much for India being in trouble without Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nWith the team's star pace bowler given a rest, Akash Deep \u2014 Bumrah's replacement \u2014 was the unlikely inspiration behind India's dominant, series-tying 336-run win over England on day five of the second Test at Edgbaston on Sunday.\n\nEngland vs India Men's cricket Test series 1st Test at Headingley: England wins by 5 wickets\n\n2nd Test at Edgbaston: India wins by 336 runs\n\n3rd Test at Lords (July 10-14)\n\n4th Test at Old Trafford (July 23-27)\n\n5th Test at The Oval (July 31-August 4) Series tied at 1-1\n\nDeep claimed the first five-wicket haul of his short Test career, removing four of the top five in England's batting order and then top scorer Jamie Smith (88) on the way to claiming figures of 6-99. He had match figures of 10-187.\n\nFittingly, the victory was clinched off the bowling of Deep, with tailender Brydon Carse scooping a catch to India captain Shubman Gill just before tea.\n\nGill was the tourists' other star performer, making 269 in the first innings and 161 in the second innings in a record-setting performance that has supercharged his first series as Test captain.\n\nSet a world-record target of 608, England started the final day on 3-72 with a draw its only realistic hope and was bowled out for 271 as India sealed a first win at Edgbaston in nine attempts.\n\nIt levelled the five-match series at 1-1 heading into the third Test at Lord's starting on Thursday.\n\nIndia recovered well after a tough defeat at Headingley last week, when England chased down 371 on day five.\n\nBumrah was left out to preserve his fitness but Deep was a more-than-able deputy.\n\nAt age 28, he is a late bloomer \u2014 certainly at Test level where he has played just eight matches since his debut in February last year \u2014 but looks the part already with his nagging line and length.\n\nSurely he will retain his spot at the home of cricket.\n\n\"He bowled with so much heart and the areas and the lengths he hit, he was just getting the ball to move both ways,\" Gill said.\n\n\"He was just magnificent for us.\"\n\nAsked if Bumrah would be back for the third Test, Gill replied: \"Definitely.\"\n\nGill is in the form of his life, racking up 430 runs in this match \u2014 second all-time for a total by one player in a Test \u2014 to go with a knock of 147 in the first test.\n\n\"I'd say I'm feeling comfortable with my game,\" Gill said with a smile.\n\n\"Hopefully with my contribution, India will be able to win this series. That would be a great achievement for us.\"\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes pointed to the failure to get the Indians out cheaply in the first innings after reducing them to 5-211 as the key part of the match.\n\nIndia went on to post 587 all out and never looked back.\n\n\"We ran in, we tried everything, we changed plans, we manoeuvred it when we could,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"But when a team is on top of you \u2014 and India is a class team \u2014 it is always hard to wrestle the momentum back.\n\n\"The opposition is full of world-class performers. It's a tough one.\"\n\nWhile Bumrah will be returning for India, the quick turnaround is likely to see England turn to injury-prone quick Jofra Archer for his first Test match since February 2021.\n\nGus Atkinson could even return from injury, too, after being added to the squad for Lord's.\n\nPlay started one hour and 40 minutes late on Sunday because of early-morning rain and a resultant wet outfield.\n\nIt reduced the number of overs available to the Indians to 80 and they made immediate inroads thanks to Deep, who had bowled Ben Duckett and Joe Root late on Saturday.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nGetting good seam movement and help from the cracks on the pitch, Deep sent in a delivery to Pope (24) that the batter gloved down and onto his stumps.\n\nIn Deep's next over, Brook (23) was trapped LBW by a ball that jagged back off the seam. England failed with a review and was 5-83.\n\nDeep had figures of 4-58 by the time he was taken out of the attack, leaving Stokes and Smith to face a stern examination against left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who was turning the ball sharply out of the rough.\n\nAnother spinner, Washington Sundar, was given a bowl before lunch and he got the key wicket of Stokes in the final over of the session, trapping the England captain LBW for 33.\n\nSmith, who made 184 not out in the first innings, offered more resistance but was running out of partners and decided to go on the attack.\n\nThe wicketkeeper hit back-to-back sixes off Deep before \u2014 off the very next delivery \u2014 going for another off a slow ball and holing out to Sundar on the boundary behind square leg.\n\nAP",

        "text": "\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to start sending letters out to various countries starting tomorrow. They\u2019ll range in value from maybe 60 or 70 per cent tariffs to 10 and 20 per cent tariffs,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money for our country, but we\u2019re giving them a bargain,\u201d he said, continuing to demonstrate his ignorance of the way tariffs work. Tariffs are paid when goods are landed in the US by the importer \u2013 they\u2019re paid for by US companies, which may absorb some of the cost or pass some or all of it onto consumers. They are a tax on domestic consumption. If the tariff rates are going to range from 10 per cent to 70 per cent they will create massive arbitrage opportunities.\n\nCountries that were uncompetitive in a regime where the average US tariff was about 2.5 per cent are suddenly going to be very competitive if their rate is 10 per cent and their competitors are being hit with tariffs that are multiples of that level. The hotchpotch of tariffs that the Trump administration envisages will create chaos within the global trading system and the supply chains that support it, along with opportunities and threats for individual economies. It will also be an administrative nightmare for US customs. The US is aware that its differential tariffs could lead to attempts to game the regime and is particularly concerned that China might do what it did during the 2018-19 trade war, during Trump\u2019s first term as president, when many Chinese exports to the US were re-routed through other Asian countries and Mexico. In the deal the administration announced with Vietnam, where it reduced the reciprocal tariff rate from 46 per cent to 20 per cent, it added a caveat. The rate will become 40 per cent on any goods or components that have been transhipped from another country. It\u2019s seeking to impose similar, China-targeting, clauses in deals with its other major trading partners, along with other restrictions on their ability to trade with China. Given that China is also a major trading partner for most other economies, the US\u2019 attempt to isolate China is likely to experience significant pushback.\n\nChina has already been re-directing its exports. In May, its exports to the US were 43 per cent lower than for the same month last year, but its total exports were up nearly 5 per cent. Exports to South East Asian countries were up 15 per cent and those to the European Union 12 per cent. Loading While it is unlikely that those exports flowing into Europe will be transhipped, the US will be playing \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d in Asia and Latin America as Chinese companies, and others, seek to exploit the new tariff regime. July 9, or whenever the new US tariff regime is in place, won\u2019t be the end of the changes to the global trade settings. A source of considerable trade friction, and an impediment to deals with Japan, South Korea and the European Union, are Trump\u2019s sectoral tariffs. The US has imposed 50 per cent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium and 25 per cent on autos and auto parts.\n\nTrump has foreshadowed \u2013 the administration is compiling the necessary documentation \u2013 further sectoral tariffs on pharmaceutical products, semiconductors, timber and copper. Any deal or, more likely, tentative outlines for deals, announced this week will be vulnerable to any future new sectoral tariffs. The EU, for instance, is a major exporter of pharmaceuticals to the US. The EU accounts for about 14 per cent of all US goods imports and is America\u2019s second-largest trade partner, behind China. While Bessent said there had been \u201cvery good progress\u201d in discussions with the EU, and the EU itself has said it is hopeful that an agreement in principle can be signed, US demands that US companies be exempt from EU regulations and that the EU accept a 17 per cent tariff on its agricultural exports, along with the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium, autos and perhaps pharmaceuticals, are massive hurdles to any final deal. The EU has drawn up its own list of potential retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US, covering about \u20ac116 billion ($A209 billion) of US goods, that it could deploy if its negotiations break down.\n\nThe potential for a full-scale trade war between the US and EU is high, adding to the threat to global trade and the global economy posed by the existing trade hostilities between the US and China. Tensions between Europe and China are also mounting as China\u2019s export volumes to the US decline but those to Europe climb. Vehicles waiting for shipment at a shipping terminal in Shanghai, China. Credit: Bloomberg Even before whatever Wednesday\u2019s deadline for deals \u2013 or Trump\u2019s unilaterally imposed tariffs \u2013 produces, the 10 per cent baseline tariffs and the 55 per cent rate on imports from China are having material effects. While the shifting flows of global trade are just starting to show up, an insight into their early impact on the US can be seen in US customs data, with tariff revenues hitting a record $US23 billion in May. That is a 270 per cent increase on the same month last year, a 25 per cent increase on the April number and a revenue stream that will obviously swell significantly once Trump\u2019s post-July 9 tariff regime is in place.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Peter Russell-Clarke, the neckerchief-clad larrikin who became an unexpected fixture in Australian lounge rooms and taught a generation how to cook long before MasterChef, has died aged 89. Russell-Clarke was the unruliest of media pioneers \u2013 a bona fide polymath whose flair for cooking was matched only by his biting political cartoons and a sharp tongue that went gloriously rogue in a now-legendary bloopers reel, long before the internet invented \u201cgoing viral\u201d. With a trademark beret, stained smock, and a tea towel thrown over one shoulder, he was never just a cook. He was a storyteller. A painter. A provocateur. A genuine original. The sort who could poach an egg and puncture a prime minister\u2019s ego in the same five-minute segment. A familiar face on television throughout the 1980s and early \u201990s, Russell-Clarke fronted more than 900 episodes of Come and Get It on the ABC. He showed generations of Australians how to toast herbs and cook chops on residual heat, and became inextricably linked with dairy marketing via a single immortal phrase: \u201cWhere\u2019s the cheese?\u201d Yet, to reduce his life to a catchcry would be like calling Michelangelo a ceiling painter. Russell-Clarke was nothing less than a renaissance man with an Australian accent and a foul mouth. He was a culinary educator, but also a talented illustrator, prolific writer, advertising guru, political cartoonist, restaurateur and satirist. He was also a wine blender and a UN food ambassador. A man who once painted Dreamtime stories with Aboriginal elders in Far North Queensland and later cooked a jubilee dinner for the then Prince Charles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in Ballarat in 1935, Russell-Clarke\u2019s early life was marked by instability. His father, a defrocked Anglican minister, and his dressmaker mother, sent him to a Catholic boarding school in Bowral, NSW, \u201cto get back at the Anglicans\u201d, but didn\u2019t bother paying the fees. His childhood, shaped by alcohol-affected parents and stints in foster care, was anything but linear. At one point, he lived with a Chinese-Australian family who taught him to cook banquet-style meals and introduced him to Eastern flavours. He would later claim these early culinary lessons formed the backbone of his intuitive, nose-first approach to food. It is difficult to know whether all his tales were true or had added garnish. He briefly lived on Melbourne\u2019s streets, scrounging behind Bourke Street institutions like Florentino. Even then, his standards were high. He once said he\u2019d written a letter to the chef, complaining that a discarded fish had freezer burn. \u201cI\u2019m buggered if I know how long I exis\u00adted like that, but it was a while. Good times, it made you lose weight!\u201d he recalled in an interview years later. Peter Russell-Clarke pictured in 2013. Credit: Melanie Faith Dove That mix of refinement and irreverence would become his signature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy his late teens, Russell-Clarke was working as a junior artist for one of Australia\u2019s top advertising agencies. His job, initially, was fetching lunches. But soon he was freelancing as an illustrator and food consultant \u2013 two disciplines he would blend with great success. He went on to become political cartoonist for the Melbourne Herald, where he drew the comic strip Ben Bowyang and skewered public figures with glee and accuracy. Loading At the same time, he began illustrating for Shell, Mobil, Ford and even Boeing \u2013 work that would take him across the globe and into the homes of corporate high-flyers. But it was food, that always kept calling him back. Russell-Clarke ran one of Melbourne\u2019s most popular restaurants, a no\u2011name, no\u2011menu venue in Carlton, often booked out 18 months in advance. Again, Charles came calling and, reportedly, he told him to \u201cbugger off\u201d because he was fully booked. \u201cI cooked a silver jubilee dinner for him and the only reason they chose me is that they knew they could get away with not paying for the meal,\u201d he once said. \u201cThe place was well ahead of its time, like a modern pop\u2011up. You just came and got whatever there was. It\u2019s just too hard if someone orders off the menu.\u201d He wrote, illustrated, or ghostwrote 35 books \u2013 including 25 cookbooks and an encyclopaedia of food. He was also, at various times, food editor for New Idea, Woman\u2019s Day, The Age, and The Daily Mirror. For 27 years, he was the face of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Egg Board, starring in TV commercials he often wrote and directed himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose of a certain age will remember him best as the five-minute man on ABC. Come and Get It, which aired just before The Goodies or Inspector Gadget, delivered succinct recipes in an unmistakable Russell-Clarke tone: warm, matey, occasionally bemused. Russell-Clarke\u2019s energy remained fierce, even when he faced health challenges in his later years. \u201cG\u2019day!\u201d he\u2019d begin, and off he\u2019d go \u2013 chatting about burnt herbs or properly cooking tomatoes (\u201cyou release a perfume\u201d) before wrapping up with \u201cyou beaut!\u201d and a cheeky grin. Behind the scenes, he was anything but tame. The infamous blooper reel \u2013 first passed around on email and then eventually YouTube \u2013 revealed a man unafraid to unleash torrents of profanity, frustration, and wit. The contrast between the polished, public Russell-Clarke and the mercurial off-air version only deepened public affection. Even in his later years, battered by health challenges \u2013 a heart attack, stroke and cancer diagnosis \u2013 Russell-Clarke\u2019s energy remained fierce. Living with his wife of six decades, Jan, in Tooborac, north of Melbourne, he still cooked, still painted and still spoke with vision-impaired cooking enthusiasts about low-heat techniques. He insisted that blindness needn\u2019t be a barrier to kitchen excellence \u2013 \u201cIt should make you a better cook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do it gently and slowly. Like making love.\u201d That gentleness wasn\u2019t always evident in his professional life. He could be abrasive, outrageous and contradictory. But there was wisdom in the way he treated food. A lamb chop deserved your attention. Herbs were to be toasted and respected. Food, for Russell-Clarke, was not just sustenance but story, art, politics and theatre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was nearly a war over Brussels sprouts, but the king of Brussels saved the day by telling the king of England how to cook them properly,\u201d he once told a young reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that story\u2019s true or not, but it sounds good.\u201d His art reflected that same narrative sensibility. He painted for commercial clients, for federal commissions, for himself. He exhibited widely around Australia and internationally, owning his own Soho Galleries on Victoria\u2019s Bellarine Peninsula and completing a 10-storey mural series for a Lygon Street building \u2013 from rabbits underground to pigeons in the sky. Pictured in 1983. His cello paintings, inspired by musical theatre pieces he composed, portrayed instruments as people: sinuous, playful, human. In 2004, the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra requested a self-portrait for one of its exhibitions. He obliged with a piece that was part man, part mirth. After losing his home in a devastating fire while overseas, Russell-Clarke did what he always did \u2013 started again. Fifty paintings were destroyed. Four finished books went up in smoke. He said it was a blessing. \u201cThe first book I\u2019ve rewritten is much better,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m singing and dancing.\u201d He famously called himself a \u201cratbag,\u201d a label friends, fans and colleagues endorsed with affection.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Lung cancer is Australia\u2019s fifth most diagnosed cancer, but causes the greatest number of deaths because it is often diagnosed too late.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this week, a new screening program became available \u2014 and there are hopes it will detect cases much earlier for those at the highest risk, including Indigenous Australians and some migrant communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to see a large number of people in their middle age to late middle age coming in with problems breathing or coughing up blood or losing weight, and they would have a diagnosis of lung cancer,\" said Dorothy Keefe, the CEO of Cancer Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I remember my first consultant ... he would sit on their beds and he would hold their hands and he would tell them that he was very sorry but there was nothing that could be done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKeefe was reflecting on her experiences of caring for patients with terminal lung cancer as a junior doctor in the United Kingdom, and she wants medical professionals to avoid as many of those conversations here as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler said despite it being one of the top five diagnosed forms of cancers, it's one of the deadliest because its often picked up when it's already advanced.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that makes them: \"very, very hard to treat \u2014 and making survivability much lower than some of the other cancers where we're seeing survivability increase quite dramatically.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Australia among first countries to launch lung cancer screening program SBS News 05/07/2025 12:37 English\n\nAnita Dessaix, chair of the Cancer Council's public health committee, said lung cancer mortality is especially a problem in some migrant communities and definitely so for Indigenous Australians, whose rates of diagnosis have been rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are particular parts of the population that experience currently worser outcomes, and that does include people who are living in rural and remote areas in Australia,\" Dessaix said. \"Those who potentially don't have English as their first language \u2014 so culturally and linguistically diverse communities \u2014 and also those who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\"\n\n\n\nWho can access the new lung cancer screening program?\n\nThe Australian government has funded a national early screening program it hopes will bring down those numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nScans to detect lung issues normally cost hundreds of dollars, but Butler said that they will now cost nothing for patients deemed to be at high risk of lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat includes people who are:\n\n\n\nBetween 50 and 70 years old\n\nShow no signs or symptoms of lung cancer\n\nHave a history of at least 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking, or are still smoking, or have quit in the past 10 years\n\nButler said the program will entitle high risk patients \"to a CT scan every two years, designed to pick up any early evidence of lung cancer and allow them then to be treated hopefully very, very successfully\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said people in regional communities would also be able to access the program later this year, with trucks equipped with mobile CT scan technology set to be rolled out in these areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international evidence for these types of screening programs is promising.\n\n\n\n\n\nButler it suggests up to 70 percent of lung cancers are detected at early stages by low-dose CT scans, and deaths are subsequently reduced by 20 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly the CEO of the Lung Foundation Australia, Mark Brooke, hopes this program \u2014 the first new national cancer screening program in 20 years \u2014 will be a game changer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will be one of the first countries in the world to have a national lung cancer screening program that will look across Australia,\" Brooke said. \"And particularly because it's been co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will support those people who have often been forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "European summer spending is set for a rebound, one of Australia's biggest banks predicts, with travellers also looking to other destinations to escape the winter at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nANZ says customers travelling to Europe across June, July, and August will spend up to $280 million \u2014 a projected 10 per cent increase compared to 2024 which it says is based on early trends in hotel and airline bookings.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says pre-travel spending data showed that between January and May, hotel and airline bookings were up 11 per cent on the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe projected total spend won't match the record of $313 million set in 2023, ANZ said. But it will be an uptick from 2024 where, despite more than 100,000 of its customers travelling to Europe, total spend and average spend per customer were down 19 per cent and 13 per cent respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond saying travel to Europe among its customers had \"dipped\" in 2024, ANZ in its statement did not explain why it believes there might be an increase in total spending this year \u2014 although not one that would match the 2023 record.\n\n\n\nSome measures show consumer confidence \u2014 which predicts how consumers feel about the economy and their own finances \u2014 has improved since 2024. But it's also higher than in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rates , however, have fallen from the 12-year high which carried from late 2023 through 2024. That has eased mortgage repayments, though disposable incomes haven't significantly increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Australia, Europe also battled a period of high inflation. Inflation in the European Union peaked at 11.5 per cent in late 2022 and has since cooled. Falling inflation doesn't necessarily equate to lower prices, it just means prices are growing at a slower rate \u2014 unless inflation turns negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a recent analysis showed that a drop in jet fuel prices had lowered airfares. Global capacity \u2014 meaning seats on planes \u2014 was also up on last year and pre-pandemic levels, contributing to falling costs, according to corporate travel advisors FCM Consulting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our data shows that customers are reigniting their passion for European travel. We\u2019re seeing strong growth in early planning activity,\" said Yiken Yang, ANZ's managing director of everyday banking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While we may not hit the $313 million peak of 2023, 2025 is shaping up as a vibrant resurgence for the travel sector.\"\n\n\n\nANZ said non-European destinations in 2024 saw a 3 per cent increase in spend for the June-August period.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia, New Zealand, Thailand and Japan were among the most popular destinations, ANZ said, which is consistent with what the Australian Bureau of Statistics says are countries favoured by holidaymakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also said Hong Kong and Sri Lanka were \"emerging hotspots\" and recording \"significant\" year-on-year growth in spend.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the implementation of US President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, some countries are now scrambling to reach a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew countries have managed to make secure deals with the US ahead of the deadline, raising concerns for the global economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 2nd of April this year, United States President Donald Trump stoked panic among global leaders, announcing sweeping tariffs on all imports to the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter upending global financial markets and igniting a global trade war, only a few days passed before the administration ordered a 90-day pause on the measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an end to the ninety days fast approaching and only a few deals reached, fears are mounting over potential impacts on the global economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump says he's signed and is ready to send letters to 12 countries so far, outlining the various tariff levels they'll face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I did, I signed some letters, and they'll go out on Monday, probably 12. Twelve different amount of money, different amounts of tariffs, and somewhat different statements. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nJOURNALIST : \"Mr. President, which countries will receive those letters on Monday?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \"It'll be announced, I have to announce it on Monday, I can't do it now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the administration's claims a pause would allow ample time to strike their goal of 90 deals in 90 days, most of those deals never materialised.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreements were made with some countries, first with the U-K, then China, and most recently Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a pact was made with Vietnam however, Chinese officials raised concerns about it's impact on Chinese trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokeswoman He Yongqian says China may take countermeasures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The imposition of the so-called 'reciprocal tariffs' by the United States on its global trading partners is a typical unilateral and bullying act. China has always firmly opposed it. We have noticed the relevant situation and is assessing the deal. China's position is consistent. We are happy to see all countries resolving economic and trade disputes with the United States through equal-footed consultation, but we firmly oppose any country reaching trade deals by sacrificing China's interests. If this happens, the Chinese side will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn India, which faces 26 per cent tariffs, officials say they're ready to make deals in the national interest but won't be rushed into reaching the US deadlines.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese and South Korea leaders are scrambling to reach a deal, with negotiators engaging in lengthy discussions with US officials over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korean President Lee Jae-Myung says negotiating a deal has been a difficult process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that the tariff negotiations are not easy. At this point, I can't confidently say whether they\u2019ll be concluded by July 8. We\u2019re doing our utmost. What\u2019s crucial is that the outcome must be mutually beneficial for both sides. However, even now, it\u2019s not entirely clear what each side precisely wants \u2014 those details are still being worked out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials also say they're closing in on a framework agreement with the European Union, which would avert 50 per cent tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTalks in Washington could go down to the wire, but officials say the E-U is willing to accept 10 per cent blanket tariffs in exchange for an extension and possible concessions on a 25 per cent car tariff.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon Schuetz is head of communications at the German Association of the automotive Industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the industry will struggle under the proposed terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, for our industry it is very important that in the upcoming week there will be a solution. We are quite aware that it is impossible in this short time to do a whole trade deal with all the details. So we are asking for first deals for the important domains like the automotive industry, because the current tariffs that we are facing are something that we cannot live with in the future that is very toxic for our industry. So Europe is really asked to find a deal with the USA now and then in the aftermath, they can do the details.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith European investors bracing for the looming impact of tariffs, European stocks declined on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoland is Europe's largest furniture exporter and the world's third largest, with the US being one of the country's biggest markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nDominik Czylkowski is the CEO of NOTI, a Polish furniture company.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the US market is crucial to success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's a big market, and that's a big partnership for us. So, of course, we cannot cut that from day to day. And of course we have to solve the issue together and handle this situation for next few weeks until we will find the best solution for us, but mainly for our customers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he has confidence the US tariffs won't impact Australia's economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as the 10 per cent baseline tariff, Australian steel and aluminium exports to the US face a 50 per cent tariff.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese told Sky News he expects the 10 per cent on all Australian imports to stay in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that no country has a better tariff, if you like, level than ten percent. Now we'll continue to put our case as we as we do, we are in a position where you know on July 9 that won't really have an impact on us, because that's about other countries who have higher rates overnight. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"We won't get a letter on July 9? We won't get a determination?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE:\" We're on 10 per cent\"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"That's what we're going to stay on after next week? \"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"Well, I assume that will be the case. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso speaking to Sky News, opposition trade spokesperson Kevin Hogan says the Prime Minister ought to be doing more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think he's waving a white flag, Andrew, and I don't know why he'd be saying that before the announcement. We have seen carve outs for some countries. We know the UK have had a bit of a carve out on the steel and aluminum tariffs. Remember, steel and aluminum tariffs have gone up to fifty percent. They're not at ten percent. Countries have got carve outs to that. We've seen carve outs, Mexico have got a few carve outs. Canada have got a few carve outs from what tariffs they initially had as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it's clear the tariffs will hit global economies hard, experts say the US economy is already facing the consequences of Mr Trump's policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute, mid-sized businesses in the US face an estimated $82.3 billion in additional costs if the US maintains a 10 per cent universal rate on all imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo senior US official has been more vocal about this than Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Mr Trump\u2019s public demands and attacks, Mr Powell says he is keeping US interest rates on hold while waiting to see how the administration\u2019s trade strategy pans out.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestifying to Congress late last month [[24/06]], he explains why.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "There were mixed fortunes for the thousands of Belgian fans who poured over the border for the opening stage of the Tour de France as Jasper Philipsen won, but star rider Remco Evenepoel faltered in his long-range bid for the title itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilipsen took the yellow jersey in a frantic sprint finish at the northern city of Lille, his tenth Tour de France win crowned with a rare race lead for a rider usually chasing sprint points.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilipsen outsprinted Eritrean Biniam Girmay and Norway's Soren Waerenskjold while Dane Vingegaard and defending champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia crossed the line in the leading group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Kaden Groves was delighted to play his part in helping his Alpecin-Deceuninck teammate Philipsen grab his third win of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were echelons and the race split with about 25km to go,\" Groves said.\n\n\n\n\"That's what we expected actually, and we had numbers in the front [group] who could dictate the race.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Philipsen added: \"It's really amazing. My 10th victory is something I will never forget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The team performance was incredible. I think we were there all day. It was very nervous but we knew today could be our day and we have to be in the front and we were there in the split.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The team did amazing and in the end we could just use our strength and finish it off.\"\n\n\n\nHow the Stage 1 race unfolded\n\nVingegaard was on red alert as the split started and his explosive acceleration helped stun the peloton and leave his Visma team delighted with the damage done by the day's work with a 40sec advantage over several important rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was our plan to use the wind at 20km and it worked,\" said Vingegaard.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown for his pounces in the mountains, Vingegaard has won the Tour in 2022 and 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 28-year-old grew up in a remote fishing community, racing into strong winds on the coastal roads in Denmark.\n\n\n\nDefending champion Pogacar appeared flustered at the finish line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was as frantic as we had expected, but when the split came fortunately I was near the front,\" said the 26-year-old Slovenian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm just happy day one is done. Nine days to go before the first rest day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBilled as the third man here after finishing behind Pogacar and Vingegaard on his debut Tour in 2024, star rider Remco Evenepoel was in sombre mood at his team bus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were asleep, we thought any danger was over,\" Evenepoel said of the split where both he and his team's sprinter Tim Merlier found themselves trapped just 20km from the finish.\n\n\n\nBelgian Remco Evenepoel of Soudal Quick-Step pictured at the start of the first stage. Source: AFP / Jasper Jacobs Around 40 riders in the first group contested the sprint where one of the day's many falls happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimoz Roglic and Florian Lipowitz of Red Bull, and Team UAE's Joao Almeida were also caught out in the blustery winds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother UAE man, Adam Yates, lost minutes, meaning Pogacar's two deputies are off the pace if something happens to the UAE star man.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica's sole rider Biniam Girmay, winner of three stages in 2024, was second on the day as Philipsen got ahead of him with 100m to go.\n\n\n\nEritrean rider Biniam Girmay celebrates on the podium with the best young rider's white jersey after the 1st stage.

From award winning artists to people doing their first canvas, we\u2019re all together, we are all helping each other and that's really, really special.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Donovan says Port Augusta has not had a centre like this since she was a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she\u2019s hoping it will bridge what she sees as a break down in connection between young people and elders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And helping the youth to get back on track and the fellas to get back together and remember what's important and that's preserving our culture and moving forward in a positive and productive way and I feel like PAAM is helping to make our community strong again. I think the hidden beauty of these art centres is the conversations that we as women are having over the table with the youth, with our children with out babies in our arms while we are making.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says PAAM supports many artists from more remote areas who need to stay in Port Augusta to access services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's many artists that have disabilities or medical reason why they need to live in Port Augusta and away from country and to have that access to supported culture in a culturally safe place that's what PAAM provides to them and I think that's very important.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Donovan's mother Artist Regina McKenzie is also a strong advocate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The more we teach our children about who and where we come from and that's our culture, the better and the continuance is something I believe we should keep practising.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

The committee had been set up back in 1957, two years after the National Missionary Council of Australia (NMCA) had asked the federal government to establish a National Aborigines Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile denying the request for a National Day, the federal government supported a National Aborigines Day via funding for publications, leaflets and stickers as a way of \"creating and promoting an informed public opinion on the status and the needs of the Aborigines \u2026 as to what is being done, and what remains to be done\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1969, the NADOC Federal Executive was made up of Rev Frank Engel (chairman), Rev Robert Denham (secretary), Rev Richard Udy (treasurer) and committee members: Rev Robert Brown (SA), Rev James Sweet (Qld), Rev G Night (NSW), Mr Ken Colbung, Mrs S Dunn (NSW), Rev E Newman (NSW) and Pastor Schultz (NSW).\n\n\n\nA turning point\n\nIn the overall historical context of National Aborigines Day or NAIDOC Week, the February 1970 meeting of the National Executive was a turning point.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the meeting, there was a move to elect an Aboriginal man \u2014 Ken Colbung from WA \u2014 as the new National Chairman. Colbung was the Secretary for NSW NADOC which had large staunch Aboriginal membership including Kaye Mundine, Clive and Tom Williams, Charles 'Chicka' Dixon, Lyall Munro, Bert Groves and Reverend Frank Roberts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be the first time an Aboriginal person would be at the helm of the National Committee; Lester Bostock was also elected a joint treasurer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn returning to Darwin, Egan typed up a report to his supervisor \u2014 Frank H Moy, assistant director (research) at the Office of Aboriginal Affairs \u2014 about the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The members of the outgoing committee seemed anxious to replace some of the church officials on the Executive with Aboriginals and this is an encouraging sign,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nEgan recommended that NADOC should be a national committee made up entirely of Indigenous representatives. Moy endorsed his observation about the lack of Aboriginal people on the National Executive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have been lecturing them on this for two years now,\" Moy scrawled in pen over this section of Egan's report.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his report, Egan went further, writing that the NADOC should be a national committee made up entirely of Indigenous representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems to me that if this is to become a national body, NADOC should appoint a representative (preferably an Aboriginal) in each state,\" Egan wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mr Phillip Roberts would be an ideal choice for the Northern Territory and perhaps one of our liaison officers for the ACT. Could it be suggested to NADOC that an Aboriginal be appointed in each State, NT and ACT?\"\n\n\n\nFrom National Aborigines Day to NAIDOC Week\n\nLater that year, in September 1970, the annual general meeting of the National Council of NADOC saw Indigenous representatives from across the nation attend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese included: Dick Roughsy (Mornington Island Qld) G Winnunguj (Goulburn Island NT), Tom Williams (Foundation Aboriginal Affairs NSW), George Abudullah (WA), Lyall Munro (Moree Advancement Committee), Kath Walker (National Tribal Council), and Dulcie Flower and Faith Bandler (Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders - FCAATSI).\n\n\n\n\n\nEgan also used his report to cheekily comment on the lack of interest in the NT about the national celebrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know at present in the Northern Territory little is done towards the observance of National Aborigines Day because it is considered to be a day on which a few 'compensation neurotics' do a bit of stirring in Sydney,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO The Next Generation celebrated by First Nations Australians during NAIDOC Week 2025 SBS News 04/07/2025 05:58 English\n\nEgan's attendance at the meeting occurred in an era of growing calls to make National Aborigines Day a proper national day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems to me that there should be a move to make it a national day in its true sense,\" Egan summarised in his report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that our role should be to make the thing financially secure as far as publications etc are concerned and thereby make it an attractive enough proposition for Aborigines to take over 'their day',\" he concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nKen Colbung would again sit as National Chairman in 1971 with Pastor Frank Roberts, Kath Walker and Dulcie Flower joining him on the National Executive.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Women and children were at the heart of the protest that birthed NAIDOC\n\nIn 1972, control of NADOC was given to the newly established Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and in 1974, the Committee had full Aboriginal representation for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1975, National Aborigines Day became NAIDOC Week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy this point, Egan had already released several albums and begun to establish his reputation as a musical chronicler of outback life.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe would go on to be a member of the first National Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and serve as administrator of the Northern Territory from 2003 to 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nNAIDOC Week will be marked 6-13 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Point airs Tuesdays 7.30pm on NITV, and is available after the broadcast on SBS On Demand .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "President Donald Trump says the United States \"pretty much\" has a deal on the sale of popular short-video app TikTok.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump told reporters on Saturday (AEST) that he would start talking to Chinese President Xi Jinping \"or one of his representatives\" early next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked how confident he was that China would agree to the deal, he said: \"I'm not confident, but I think so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the deal is good for China, and it's good for us\" Trump said. \"And for us, it's money ... we make a lot of money if the deal goes through.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TikTok saga started after bipartisan legislation to ban the app on national security grounds unless it was sold to American buyers was signed early last year under the Biden administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was scheduled to take effect the day before Trump's inauguration in January. But since then, the US President has extended the deadline for a sale three times , giving ByteDance time to spin off TikTok's US operations into a new firm that is majority-owned and operated by US citizens.\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about the potenial buyers?\n\nByteDance has previously confirmed talks with the US government, saying key matters needed to be resolved and that any deal would be \"subject to approval under Chinese law\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the deal to comply with US law, ByteDance cannot own more than 20 per cent of TikTok.\n\n\n\n\n\nLate last month, Trump told Fox News a buyer had been found and could be disclosed in about two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe didn't name the potential buyers, but said they are \"very wealthy people\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, Trump also mentioned that a group of buyers was prepared to pay \"a lot of money\" for TikTok.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous month he said China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over Trump's tariffs on Beijing .\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral US media outlets reported earlier this year that TikTok's US technology partner, Oracle, could take over in a deal that would potentially include the app's American investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there have also been reports that a group called The People\u2019s Bid for TikTok might also be a potential buyer. The group is owned by billionaire Frank McCourt, who is known as the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reporting by the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news agencies.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Some 43 people, including 15 children, have been confirmed dead following flash floods in central Texas, authorities said as rescuers continued a frantic search for campers, vacationers and residents who were still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 850 people had been rescued, including some who were clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 38cm of rain in an area around the Guadalupe River, about 140km northwest of San Antonio.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the missing were 27 girls from the Camp Mystic summer camp, Kerrville city manager Dalton Rice said at a press conference on Saturday evening, and there may be others beyond that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are kind of looking at this in two ways called the known missing, which is the 27 ... We will not put a number on the other side because we just don't know,\" Rice said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as 29 feet.\n\n\n\nOnlookers survey damage along the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area. Source: AAP / Eric Gay/AP \"We know that the rivers rise, but nobody saw this coming,\" said Kerr County judge Rob Kelly, the top local official in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nKerr County sheriff Larry Leitha said eight of the confirmed dead, including three children, had yet to be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick said an unknown number of visitors had come to the area for an Independence Day celebration by the river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don't know how many people were in tents on the side, in small trailers by the side, in rented homes by the side,\" he said on Fox News Live.\n\n\n\n\n\nCamp Mystic had 700 girls in residence at the time of the flood, according to Patrick. Another girls' camp, Heart O' the Hills, said on its website that co-owner Jane Ragsdale had died in the flood but no campers had been present as it was between sessions.\n\n\n\nThe Camp Mystic Christian summer campsite was completely destroyed. Source: AP / Julio Cortez Videos posted online showed bare concrete platforms where homes used to stand and piles of rubble along the banks of the river. Rescuers plucked residents from rooftops and trees, sometimes forming human chains to fetch people from the floodwater, local media reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal officials said the extreme flooding struck before dawn on Saturday (AEST) with little or no warning, precluding authorities from issuing advance evacuation orders as the Guadalupe River swiftly rose above major flood stage in less than two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said a \"moderate\" flood watch issued the previous day by the National Weather Service did not accurately predict the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe administration has cut thousands of jobs from the National Weather Service's parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving many weather offices understaffed, said former NOAA director Rick Spinrad.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but said they would inevitably degrade the agency's ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People's ability to prepare for these storms will be compromised. It undoubtedly means that additional lives will be lost and probably more property damage,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBold, brash, and unapologetic, Noel and Liam Gallagher are back on stage for what some say is the most highly anticipated reunion tour of the century.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe British brothers from Manchester are once again fronting Oasis, the band responsible for major hits 'Wonderwall' and Don't Look Back in Anger' and ranked among the best selling groups of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir reunion comes sixteen years after Noel left the group, saying he could no longer work with his brother Liam.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, with the hatchet seemingly buried, the pair are performing their first comeback show at Cardiff's Principality Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nForming in 1991, Oasis emerged as the face of a new cultural moment in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe moment was marked by the election of Tony Blair, the rise of UK artists like Damien Hirst, and UK models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell ruling the fashion runways.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an unpolished and at times insolent charisma, the Gallagher brothers captured the mood of a generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Stone UK reporter Nick Reilly says their success was, in part, fueled by what they represented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the 90s generally was a period of optimism. You kind of speak of Cool Britannia and the fact that Noel was so closely aligned to Tony Blair. And I think, you know, that there was a sense of optimism in the air and Oasis were a massive part of that. So I think that that optimism and that kind of joy that they offered in their music was part of it, but also the swagger, the kind of old rock and roll spirit like you mentioned the 60s. I think in many ways this was the first time we'd seen a band since perhaps like The Stones or The Who that had that sense of swagger in British music and that sense of like unrepentant rock and roll lifestyle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band's story was always volatile, marked by repeated clashes between the brothers even before their split in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first public clash was in 1994, when a gig in Los Angeles turned ugly after Liam flung insults at the band and chucked a tambourine at his brother.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1995, an interview with the brothers found its way onto a vinyl entitled Wibbling Rivalry, cementing the brothers explosive reputation in the public mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoel: Not at all. Not at all. Not at all. What I'm saying is, what I'm saying is you think...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam: \"You get into situations...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoel: \"No...you think it's rock'n'roll to get thrown off a ferry, and it's not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam: \"I don't think it's rock'n' roll.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoel: You f**king...that was your quote, you prick!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam: \"No it weren't\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were numerous public clashes between the brothers in the nineties and early 2000's.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in 2009, after a show in Paris ended in a backstage fight, the group announced their split.\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Reilly says after so much animosity between them, many fans never thought a reunion was possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And there's so many people that are in their 40s and 50s now that will remember that as one of the key milestones of their early years. So now, if we're speaking 16 years after they split up and suddenly the fans are given a chance to relive that one more time and have this band back together, when many thought it would be impossible given how acrimonious that split was in 2009. It's natural that there will be like a clamour of those fans who will want to see them again. But also I think that there's a certain timelessness with Oasis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even in 2011, Noel Gallagher told reporters he had regrets about how things went down that night in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I regret it really because we only had two gigs left. If I had my time again, I would've gone back and done the gigs. That gig would have been dreadful because he was out of his mind. I would have done that gig and done the next gig and we'd have all gone away and we could've probably discussed it, what we were going to do. We may never have split up, we may just have just taken a hiatus and we could have all gone and done our other thing. Liam always said he would bring down Armageddon in the end. That's the way he kind of likes things to be, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the next few years, the brothers both launched solo careers, but Liam was adamant he would never return to Oasis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in 2018, through a series of tweets, Liam changed his tune - finally raising the possibility of a reunion.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told reporters in 2019 that he was serious about the idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most important thing is about me and him being brothers. I've got another brother who he doesn't speak to. It would be nice if all three of us would be together. Obviously, our mum is still alive, so she gets upset by it. But he thinks I'm desperate to get the band back together for money. But I didn't join the band to make money. I joined the band to have fun and get off my head and go and see the world. I'd do it for nothing if everyone else is doing it for nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Oasis officially announced a reunion tour in August last year many were in disbelief.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke Mounteney was around nine years old when the band split, he says he was certain he'd never get this chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019No, I thought. No, I don't think anyone of us really truly thought it would ever happen. I'd sort of committed that my life, I would never get to see Oasis because I haven\u2019t seen before. So when it came about that it was a real thing, I don't think my heart rate dropped for a good while until I got tickets. And I remember I sat just crying with pure, genuine joy that I'd got a ticket and it was just an unbelievable moment for life, yeah.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile fans had been pleading for the group to reunite for years, website issues and controversial dynamic pricing brought outrage, with many failing to secure a spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile tickets were initially shown at one price, around $300, once fans reached the front of the digital queue, many found that basic tickets were rebranded as 'in demand' and double the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some fans though, no price was too high.\n\n\n\n\n\n''Kind of what I expected it to be honest you know, it's their reunion they haven't been together for literally decades at this point. So I'd be willing to pay anything to, you know, see the reunion, especially first night as well. It's incredible.''\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Cardiff, Oasis will tour the UK throughout July, August and September.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group will then head to Japan, South Korea, South America, Australia and North America.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 48-year-old Matt Hobman, this tour is not just about the music.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to start sending letters out to various countries starting tomorrow. They\u2019ll range in value from maybe 60 or 70 per cent tariffs to 10 and 20 per cent tariffs,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money for our country, but we\u2019re giving them a bargain,\u201d he said, continuing to demonstrate his ignorance of the way tariffs work. Tariffs are paid when goods are landed in the US by the importer \u2013 they\u2019re paid for by US companies, which may absorb some of the cost or pass some or all of it onto consumers. They are a tax on domestic consumption. If the tariff rates are going to range from 10 per cent to 70 per cent they will create massive arbitrage opportunities.\n\nCountries that were uncompetitive in a regime where the average US tariff was about 2.5 per cent are suddenly going to be very competitive if their rate is 10 per cent and their competitors are being hit with tariffs that are multiples of that level. The hotchpotch of tariffs that the Trump administration envisages will create chaos within the global trading system and the supply chains that support it, along with opportunities and threats for individual economies. It will also be an administrative nightmare for US customs. The US is aware that its differential tariffs could lead to attempts to game the regime and is particularly concerned that China might do what it did during the 2018-19 trade war, during Trump\u2019s first term as president, when many Chinese exports to the US were re-routed through other Asian countries and Mexico. In the deal the administration announced with Vietnam, where it reduced the reciprocal tariff rate from 46 per cent to 20 per cent, it added a caveat. The rate will become 40 per cent on any goods or components that have been transhipped from another country. It\u2019s seeking to impose similar, China-targeting, clauses in deals with its other major trading partners, along with other restrictions on their ability to trade with China. Given that China is also a major trading partner for most other economies, the US\u2019 attempt to isolate China is likely to experience significant pushback.\n\nChina has already been re-directing its exports. In May, its exports to the US were 43 per cent lower than for the same month last year, but its total exports were up nearly 5 per cent. Exports to South East Asian countries were up 15 per cent and those to the European Union 12 per cent. Loading While it is unlikely that those exports flowing into Europe will be transhipped, the US will be playing \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d in Asia and Latin America as Chinese companies, and others, seek to exploit the new tariff regime. July 9, or whenever the new US tariff regime is in place, won\u2019t be the end of the changes to the global trade settings. A source of considerable trade friction, and an impediment to deals with Japan, South Korea and the European Union, are Trump\u2019s sectoral tariffs. The US has imposed 50 per cent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium and 25 per cent on autos and auto parts.\n\nTrump has foreshadowed \u2013 the administration is compiling the necessary documentation \u2013 further sectoral tariffs on pharmaceutical products, semiconductors, timber and copper. Any deal or, more likely, tentative outlines for deals, announced this week will be vulnerable to any future new sectoral tariffs. The EU, for instance, is a major exporter of pharmaceuticals to the US. The EU accounts for about 14 per cent of all US goods imports and is America\u2019s second-largest trade partner, behind China. While Bessent said there had been \u201cvery good progress\u201d in discussions with the EU, and the EU itself has said it is hopeful that an agreement in principle can be signed, US demands that US companies be exempt from EU regulations and that the EU accept a 17 per cent tariff on its agricultural exports, along with the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium, autos and perhaps pharmaceuticals, are massive hurdles to any final deal. The EU has drawn up its own list of potential retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US, covering about \u20ac116 billion ($A209 billion) of US goods, that it could deploy if its negotiations break down.\n\nThe potential for a full-scale trade war between the US and EU is high, adding to the threat to global trade and the global economy posed by the existing trade hostilities between the US and China. Tensions between Europe and China are also mounting as China\u2019s export volumes to the US decline but those to Europe climb. Vehicles waiting for shipment at a shipping terminal in Shanghai, China. Credit: Bloomberg Even before whatever Wednesday\u2019s deadline for deals \u2013 or Trump\u2019s unilaterally imposed tariffs \u2013 produces, the 10 per cent baseline tariffs and the 55 per cent rate on imports from China are having material effects. While the shifting flows of global trade are just starting to show up, an insight into their early impact on the US can be seen in US customs data, with tariff revenues hitting a record $US23 billion in May. That is a 270 per cent increase on the same month last year, a 25 per cent increase on the April number and a revenue stream that will obviously swell significantly once Trump\u2019s post-July 9 tariff regime is in place.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Peter Russell-Clarke, the neckerchief-clad larrikin who became an unexpected fixture in Australian lounge rooms and taught a generation how to cook long before MasterChef, has died aged 89. Russell-Clarke was the unruliest of media pioneers \u2013 a bona fide polymath whose flair for cooking was matched only by his biting political cartoons and a sharp tongue that went gloriously rogue in a now-legendary bloopers reel, long before the internet invented \u201cgoing viral\u201d. With a trademark beret, stained smock, and a tea towel thrown over one shoulder, he was never just a cook. He was a storyteller. A painter. A provocateur. A genuine original. The sort who could poach an egg and puncture a prime minister\u2019s ego in the same five-minute segment. A familiar face on television throughout the 1980s and early \u201990s, Russell-Clarke fronted more than 900 episodes of Come and Get It on the ABC. He showed generations of Australians how to toast herbs and cook chops on residual heat, and became inextricably linked with dairy marketing via a single immortal phrase: \u201cWhere\u2019s the cheese?\u201d Yet, to reduce his life to a catchcry would be like calling Michelangelo a ceiling painter. Russell-Clarke was nothing less than a renaissance man with an Australian accent and a foul mouth. He was a culinary educator, but also a talented illustrator, prolific writer, advertising guru, political cartoonist, restaurateur and satirist. He was also a wine blender and a UN food ambassador. A man who once painted Dreamtime stories with Aboriginal elders in Far North Queensland and later cooked a jubilee dinner for the then Prince Charles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in Ballarat in 1935, Russell-Clarke\u2019s early life was marked by instability. His father, a defrocked Anglican minister, and his dressmaker mother, sent him to a Catholic boarding school in Bowral, NSW, \u201cto get back at the Anglicans\u201d, but didn\u2019t bother paying the fees. His childhood, shaped by alcohol-affected parents and stints in foster care, was anything but linear. At one point, he lived with a Chinese-Australian family who taught him to cook banquet-style meals and introduced him to Eastern flavours. He would later claim these early culinary lessons formed the backbone of his intuitive, nose-first approach to food. It is difficult to know whether all his tales were true or had added garnish. He briefly lived on Melbourne\u2019s streets, scrounging behind Bourke Street institutions like Florentino. Even then, his standards were high. He once said he\u2019d written a letter to the chef, complaining that a discarded fish had freezer burn. \u201cI\u2019m buggered if I know how long I exis\u00adted like that, but it was a while. Good times, it made you lose weight!\u201d he recalled in an interview years later. Peter Russell-Clarke pictured in 2013. Credit: Melanie Faith Dove That mix of refinement and irreverence would become his signature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy his late teens, Russell-Clarke was working as a junior artist for one of Australia\u2019s top advertising agencies. His job, initially, was fetching lunches. But soon he was freelancing as an illustrator and food consultant \u2013 two disciplines he would blend with great success. He went on to become political cartoonist for the Melbourne Herald, where he drew the comic strip Ben Bowyang and skewered public figures with glee and accuracy. Loading At the same time, he began illustrating for Shell, Mobil, Ford and even Boeing \u2013 work that would take him across the globe and into the homes of corporate high-flyers. But it was food, that always kept calling him back. Russell-Clarke ran one of Melbourne\u2019s most popular restaurants, a no\u2011name, no\u2011menu venue in Carlton, often booked out 18 months in advance. Again, Charles came calling and, reportedly, he told him to \u201cbugger off\u201d because he was fully booked. \u201cI cooked a silver jubilee dinner for him and the only reason they chose me is that they knew they could get away with not paying for the meal,\u201d he once said. \u201cThe place was well ahead of its time, like a modern pop\u2011up. You just came and got whatever there was. It\u2019s just too hard if someone orders off the menu.\u201d He wrote, illustrated, or ghostwrote 35 books \u2013 including 25 cookbooks and an encyclopaedia of food. He was also, at various times, food editor for New Idea, Woman\u2019s Day, The Age, and The Daily Mirror. For 27 years, he was the face of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Egg Board, starring in TV commercials he often wrote and directed himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose of a certain age will remember him best as the five-minute man on ABC. Come and Get It, which aired just before The Goodies or Inspector Gadget, delivered succinct recipes in an unmistakable Russell-Clarke tone: warm, matey, occasionally bemused. Russell-Clarke\u2019s energy remained fierce, even when he faced health challenges in his later years. \u201cG\u2019day!\u201d he\u2019d begin, and off he\u2019d go \u2013 chatting about burnt herbs or properly cooking tomatoes (\u201cyou release a perfume\u201d) before wrapping up with \u201cyou beaut!\u201d and a cheeky grin. Behind the scenes, he was anything but tame. The infamous blooper reel \u2013 first passed around on email and then eventually YouTube \u2013 revealed a man unafraid to unleash torrents of profanity, frustration, and wit. The contrast between the polished, public Russell-Clarke and the mercurial off-air version only deepened public affection. Even in his later years, battered by health challenges \u2013 a heart attack, stroke and cancer diagnosis \u2013 Russell-Clarke\u2019s energy remained fierce. Living with his wife of six decades, Jan, in Tooborac, north of Melbourne, he still cooked, still painted and still spoke with vision-impaired cooking enthusiasts about low-heat techniques. He insisted that blindness needn\u2019t be a barrier to kitchen excellence \u2013 \u201cIt should make you a better cook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do it gently and slowly. Like making love.\u201d That gentleness wasn\u2019t always evident in his professional life. He could be abrasive, outrageous and contradictory. But there was wisdom in the way he treated food. A lamb chop deserved your attention. Herbs were to be toasted and respected. Food, for Russell-Clarke, was not just sustenance but story, art, politics and theatre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was nearly a war over Brussels sprouts, but the king of Brussels saved the day by telling the king of England how to cook them properly,\u201d he once told a young reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that story\u2019s true or not, but it sounds good.\u201d His art reflected that same narrative sensibility. He painted for commercial clients, for federal commissions, for himself. He exhibited widely around Australia and internationally, owning his own Soho Galleries on Victoria\u2019s Bellarine Peninsula and completing a 10-storey mural series for a Lygon Street building \u2013 from rabbits underground to pigeons in the sky. Pictured in 1983. His cello paintings, inspired by musical theatre pieces he composed, portrayed instruments as people: sinuous, playful, human. In 2004, the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra requested a self-portrait for one of its exhibitions. He obliged with a piece that was part man, part mirth. After losing his home in a devastating fire while overseas, Russell-Clarke did what he always did \u2013 started again. Fifty paintings were destroyed. Four finished books went up in smoke. He said it was a blessing. \u201cThe first book I\u2019ve rewritten is much better,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m singing and dancing.\u201d He famously called himself a \u201cratbag,\u201d a label friends, fans and colleagues endorsed with affection.\n\nAdvertisement",

Picture: NCA NewsWire / John Gass\n\nIt follows the union\u2019s rejection of the government\u2019s latest wage offer of an 11 per cent pay rise over three years, in favour of a 13 per cent increase over the same period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government\u2019s proposal includes staged increases of 3 per cent in April 2025, 2.5 per cent in both April 2026 and April 2027, with a final 3 per cent in December 2027.\n\nHealth Minister Tim Nicholls has described it as a \u201cnation-leading\u201d package that includes an \u201cAustralian-first double-time-for-overtime care package\u201d. However, QNMU Secretary Sarah Beaman said the deal would strip Queensland\u2019s nurses and midwives of their status as the highest paid in the country, a position they\u2019ve held for 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe will not be gaslit, or taken for fools,\u201d Ms Beaman said.\n\nQNMU Secretary Sarah Beaman said the Queensland Government\u2019s deal would strip Queensland\u2019s nurses and midwives of their status as the highest paid in the country, a position they\u2019ve held for 15 years. Picture: Richard Walker\n\nStage 2 of the protected action, legally permitted under the Fair Work Act 2009, will see union members refuse overtime without at least four hours\u2019 notice, take their full meal and rest breaks, and step back from administrative duties including filing, data entry, stock replenishment, and internal meetings unrelated to patient care.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther disruptions include a refusal to clean beds, move furniture, handle non-clinical waste, or participate in Medicare admissions documentation.\n\nIn mental health services, formal national reporting tools will be paused, although clinical observations will continue to be recorded.\n\nThe first stage of industrial action began on June 5 with low-level visibility activities such as staff wearing pink or promotional shirts and email signature updates.\n\nWhile this initially led to two weeks of renewed bargaining, the union says negotiations broke down when the government \u201cpulled the rug out\u201d on perceived progress.\n\nHealth Minister Tim Nicholls described the governments offer as a \u201cnation-leading\u201d package that includes an \u201cAustralian-first double-time-for-overtime care package.\u201d Picture: NewsWire/Tertius Pickard\n\nAlthough wages are the headline issue, the industrial action highlights a string of longstanding grievances within Queensland\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nNurses cite burnout, poor nurse-to-patient ratios, staff shortages, especially in regional areas, and broken promises from Covid-era commitments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSurveys have found that over 58 per cent of Australian nurses report burnout, and 71 per cent say they are asked to do more than they can manage. Almost half of QNMU members surveyed said they were considering leaving the profession.\n\nThe union is also calling for improved minimum nurse-to-patient ratios, claiming current workloads are unsafe and compromise patient outcomes.\n\nNurses cite burnout, poor nurse-to-patient ratios, staff shortages, especially in regional areas, and broken promises from Covid-era commitments. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Dan Peled\n\nA 2024 report from the Nurses Professional Association of Queensland (NPAQ) also raised concerns about centralised bureaucracy, with one administrator for every two nurses in Queensland, compared to a 1:5 to 1:7 ratio in Germany and Scandinavia, as well as a culture of fear, bullying and punished whistleblowing.\n\nThe suicides of two midwives, one a new graduate and the other senior, at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital in 2015 and 2023 were cited as tragic examples of this toxic environment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMidwife Jackie Pulleine alleged she faced retribution after raising concerns about patient safety at Redcliffe Hospital.\n\nQNMU says increasing waitlists, chronic overcrowding in emergency departments, and the death of Baby Benson amid neonatal bed shortages are all symptoms of a broken system.\n\nMs Beaman outside Townsville University Hospital with local clinical nurse Jo Konings. Ms Beaman said the funding necessary to recruit and retain skilled humans to care for Queensland has not been appropriately allocated.\n\nThe state government has now referred the dispute to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation.\n\nHealth Minister Tim Nicholls said the government remains committed to delivering a \u201cnation-leading wages deal\u201d as part of a record $33 billion investment in the state\u2019s health system.\n\nThat includes hiring 4,500 additional health workers over the next year, he said.\n\nHowever, the QNMU argues this investment must also be reflected in frontline wages.\n\n\u201cThe funding necessary to recruit and retain skilled humans to care for Queensland has not been appropriately allocated,\u201d Ms Beaman said.\n\n\u201cMultibillion-dollar health facilities without skilled staff are like a car without an engine.\u201d\n\nWith protected action escalating Tuesday and no resolution in sight, the QNMU warns the dispute \u201ccould escalate if demands are not met\u201d.",
