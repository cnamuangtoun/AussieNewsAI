        "text": "Donkey Kong Bananza is arguably Nintendo's most important game of 2025.\n\nIt's being crafted by the team that made 2017's sensational Super Mario Odyssey.\n\nThat pedigree comes with great expectations. DK hasn't been the star of a 3D platformer for more than 25 years and there's pressure to maintain momentum after Mario Kart World helped make the Nintendo Switch 2 the fastest selling game console of all time.\n\nLast week, Nintendo invited me to play Donkey Kong Bananza for about four hours.\n\nSO EASY EVEN A MONKEY CAN DO IT\n\nA few things didn't click when I first played Donkey Kong Bananza.\n\nThe camera can get funky when you've burrowed a narrow tunnel and controlling DK isn't as intuitive as running and jumping with Mario.\n\nThe B, Y and X buttons are tied to punching down, forward and up respectively; relegating DK's jump to the A button, which is an odd placement for a Nintendo platformer. After more time with the game I got used to it but every now and then I'd hit the wrong button and punch downward to my death.\n\n\n\nDonkey Kong has a lot more moves than Mario to learn too.\n\nBesides punching, he can rip off chunks of enemies and the environment (ZR), throw those chunks (ZR), aim to throw (by holding ZR), slap his hands together to collect nearby items (R), roll (ZL) and start 'turf surfing' by pressing ZL while holding a piece of terrain.\n\nThat's a lot to wrap your head around. The game does a very good job at teaching you everything but if I struggle with it at times, newer players may find the barrier to entry a little higher than they might expect.\n\nDon't accidentally try to punch down while hanging, you'll fall instead! (Nintendo )\n\nNEW DONK CITIES\n\nMy preview covered four of the game's levels, including: the tutorial area is a monkey mining colony; the game's first level and two levels from later in the game which bring water and poison into the mix.\n\nEach is wonderfully different from the last and, in classic Nintendo style, each has a gimmick which adds to the variety.\n\nIn the poison swamp level, which is very reminiscent of Super Mario Odyssey's Lost Kingdom, there are seeds you can pick up and throw at walls to create an instant bridge between you and the spot you just hit.\n\nThere are also enemies that chomp at you, whose bodies you can use like a bridge if you dodge at the right time.\n\nYou mean Pauline is trapped inside that thing? (Nintendo)\n\nLike Odyssey, levels have a general goal but you're encouraged to explore. It's less about making it to the end and more about how much you can discover along the way.\n\nAnd in keeping with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, puzzles often have more than one solution thanks to how the world's environment interacts.\n\nMetal is stronger than stone, stone is stronger than dirt, and dirt is stronger than sand. Sand is so soft that you can stack it on top of itself to create makeshift towers or bridges.\n\nThere are also purple-veined explosive materials that can tear everything to shreds.\n\nIt's a level of complexity that is woven into everything from exploration to boss encounters.\n\nMinecarts demand more than timing in DK Bananza. (Nintendo)\n\nThe levels themselves are wonderfully designed with puzzles and challenge areas scattered throughout.\n\nChallenges are often 'locked' behind Void Co tape (the game's villains) which can be removed by Odd-Rock or Pauline's singing (holding down L).\n\nThe ones I played ranged from defeating a number of enemies within a time limit to entire side-scrolling levels which had me blasting through barrels to find the game's main collectable; banana gems called Banandium.\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TIES WITH THAT\n\nCollectibles are only as fun as what they unlock and, even after a short time with the game, I can tell that DK Bananza's 'economy' is one of Nintendo's best.\n\nCollecting five Banandium gems unlocks a skill point, which you can use to unlock and power up new abilities.\n\nBanandium chips (aka Super Mario Odyssey's purple coins) can be used to buy new outfits for Pauline and DK, and even change the colour of DK's fur.\n\nUnlike Super Mario Odyssey, these outfits actually carry special buffs like swimming faster or taking less damage from poison.\n\nAnd finally, there are a heap of musical tracks to collect and listen to (Mario Kart World take note!).\n\nThat music is both critical to the story of Donkey Kong Bananza and DK's new Bananza power-ups.\n\nOSTRICH KONG?\n\nLookin\u2019 great! (Nintendo )\n\nNintendo has already showed off three Bananza power-ups: Kong, Zebra and Ostrich.\n\nI only got to try the Kong and Ostrich Bananzas in my preview and I'm happy to report they are as fun (and ridiculous) as they sound.\n\nThe Kong Bananza transforms DK into something more like a silverback gorilla and gives him the strength to punch through metal. The Ostrich Bananza transforms DK into (you guessed it) an ostrich with the ability to fly and drop egg bombs, which is another control scheme you'll have to wrap your head around.\n\nYou'll need to collect gold (like Mario's coins) to activate these temporary transformations. I was able to 'cheese' my way through a few puzzles by exploiting the power-ups, which are incredibly overpowered, but nowhere near as overpowered as adding a second player.\n\nFind updrafts to fly higher as Ostrich Kong. (Nintendo)\n\n2P CHEAT CODE\n\nHanding a controller to a friend to control Pauline is effectively a cheat code. The game effectively becomes a third-person shooter with unlimited ammo.\n\nI let my lovely Nintendo rep take over as Donkey Kong so I could blast our way through a few bosses as Pauline and it rendered them useless.\n\nThis isn't the way I'd want to play but it'd probably be a blast for two young siblings. Unlike Super Mario Odyssey and the Galaxy games which gave the secondary players almost zero influence to maintain the integrity of the challenge, DK Bananza just rips the band-aid off and asks what is going to be the most fun?\n\nThe mouse controls work really well but I found it easier to use the gyro controls instead.\n\nPauline's voice attacks appear as words on screen. (Nintendo)\n\nLINGERING QUESTIONS\n\nWe still know little to nothing about DK Banaza's story. I don't play Mario games for their plot, but Nintendo is trying something new here and fans are desperate to know how (or if) a teenage Pauline on a quest to the centre of the earth becomes mayor of New Donk City.\n\nI have no doubt that Donkey Kong Bananza is a fun game. I'm less sure about its performance.\n\nDuring my demo I repeatedly noticed stutters in its frame rate. To my eyes, these slowdowns were more dramatic and far more noticeable than the performance problems The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past suffered on the original Nintendo Switch.\n\nSmall, distracting artifacts appear at the edges of DK's fur in this opening cutscene. (Nintendo)\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza also doesn't appear to be pushing anywhere close to 4K either. Textures on destructible environments can appear muddy and furry characters (including DK himself) don't look as sharp as they should, which could be the result of AI upscaling.\n\nI wasn't counting pixels and it might have been the TV I was playing on or how close I was sitting to it, but the game wasn't reaching the same heights as Mario Kart World or the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild, which I've been spending plenty of time enjoying.",

(ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nThe audit, which covers the 2023-24 financial year, also alleges the council's purchasing policies were not followed in regard to a $1-million housing project.\n\nIt also revealed that a charter airline that sued for $214,203 had no formal agreement with the council.\n\nThe audit confirmed the shire was in dire financial straits months before Mr Trail was suspended on November 14, which eventually led to his resignation on April 17.\n\nThe shire's chief financial officer was also suspended on November 6.\n\nAn investigation by external consultants is ongoing.\n\nRatepayers have been making their feelings about the council known. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)\n\nWorking from the Caribbean\n\nThe audit revealed that a senior project officer employed by the Shire of Coolgardie from October 2023 to October 2024 was working remotely from the Caribbean island of Montserrat.\n\nThe audit found the recruitment was directly undertaken by the ex-chief executive, bypassing the shire's recruitment and selection policy.\n\nThe staff member, who was not named, was also in breach of a 417 working holiday visa.\n\nMontserrat is approximately 18,000km from the offices of the Shire of Coolgardie. (Supplied)\n\n\"We inquired but did not receive a response from shire management on how the staff member performed their duties efficiently while being in a different jurisdiction with a 12-hour time difference from Perth,\" the audit stated.\n\n\"Additionally, we noted that the staff member is currently working for the government of Montserrat.\n\n\" Shire management at the time advised us that they were not aware of this employment despite it being clearly indicated on the staff member's resume. \"\n\nThe audit stated that the employment contract was terminated on October 2, 2024, but the laptop provided to the staff member had not been recovered.\n\nFinancial viability in doubt\n\nThe audit was publicly released by the shire this week after being referenced in state parliament by Local Government Minister Hannah Beazley, who declared \"shocking mismanagement\" had left the council in a \"financial mess\".\n\nThe audit \u2013 certified by the Auditor-General's senior director of financial audit Tim Sanya \u2013 showed the shire incurred a net loss of $4.6 million for the 12 months to June 30, 2024.\n\nIt found the council's liabilities exceeded its asset base by $14.2m and that there was $4.8m in overdue payments to vendors.\n\n\"These conditions indicate a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the shire to continue as a going concern,\" the audit said.\n\nRatepayers protested outside the Shire of Coolgardie offices in April.

(ABC News: James Elton)\n\nThe reforms follow a series of controversies, including two NT clothing stores being ordered to stop using the service over concerns they were putting their mostly Aboriginal customers at financial risk by signing them up to debts they did not fully understand and could not afford.\n\nThe Albanese government announced sweeping changes to the service in December last year, with former minister Bill Shorten saying Centrepay had been \"misfiring\" and \"not working as intended\".\n\n\"Some services being provided through Centrepay were really not appropriate for the vulnerable people on the government's systems,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe reforms are expected to only apply to new businesses at first, with existing Centrepay-enabled businesses in categories slated for removal to be given more time to phase out their use.\n\nShops say they face 'collapse', job losses\n\nIn Katherine, there are five clothing stores using Centrepay, which financial counsellors have previously described as a \"high concentration\" for a town of its size.\n\nThree of them have said their businesses will go broke without access to the scheme.\n\nUrban Rampage, a chain with stores across remote northern Australia, told a tribunal last year an Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) order to stop using Centrepay would cause its business to \"collapse\" and its staff to be terminated.\n\nUrban Rampage has claimed an ASIC stop order amounts to discrimination against its First Nations consumers.

This includes many small businesses that are struggling to survive in the current difficult trading environment. \"The union-friendly supported bargaining stream was intended to operate in sectors where the employers and employees need a lot of support to bargain, typically because of the Government-funded nature of those sectors. This is the first time that a supported bargaining authorisation has been issued outside of a Government-funded sector. \"Many hundreds of enterprise agreements have been made in the fast-food industry and there is no reason why the main enterprise bargaining laws should not apply, including the requirement for a union to establish that the majority of employees support the negotiation of an enterprise agreement.\"\n\nThis decision could mean other large fast-food retailers will also be dragged to the negotiating table by unions seeking better pay and conditions for workers.\n\nMore to come.",

(ABC News: James Carmody)\n\nWould it be reasonable to expect the department to bring those broader issues to the attention of those other authorities who it said would be better placed to look into them?\n\n\"I do not consider the department would do so,\" was Coroner Urquhart's assessment.\n\nThe reason was simple.\n\nAt the same time as the department was telling him more fundamental issues should be looked into elsewhere, it was arguing there was no reason to even go looking.\n\nCoroner flags special inquiry into Unit 18 in wake of teen's death in detention Photo shows A young boy sits with an electric guitar. The coroner investigating Western Australia\u2019s first recorded death in youth detention says there is significant evidence the teenager\u2019s needs were not met, and indicated he may call for a wider-ranging inquiry.\n\n\"The department does not consider there is any material to suggest there is any scope for an adverse comment to be made about itself or its employees on most, if not all, of those issues,\" was how Coroner Urquhart summed it up.\n\nBut he has a different view.\n\nTimeframe questioned\n\nThose issues were serious and included problems at Banksia Hill Detention Centre which led to the rushed opening of Unit 18, allegations of \"untruthful or misleading messaging\" about the facility and whether it had been opened \"before it was safe to do so\".\n\n\"There is evidence that has revealed aspects of the manner in which the department did its work which is worthy, in my view, of closer examination in a special inquiry,\" was the polite way he phrased it, pointing to some of the evidence he had heard.\n\nAmong it, testimony from then-corrective services commissioner Mike Reynolds, who had been on leave around the opening of Unit 18, that it was a \"bad decision\" which was \"destined to fail\".\n\nHe also pointed to evidence from Christine Ginbey, who had been in charge of youth detention at the time, saying the three weeks or so her team was given to get Unit 18 ready was \"entirely unreasonable\" and should have been closer to six months.\n\nChristine Ginbey says the timeframe given to open Unit 18 was \"entirely unreasonable\". (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nWhile the idea of a special inquiry makes sense \u2014 given its scope can be much broader and be less constrained in the findings it could make, especially against public servants \u2014 it's hard to see the government willingly submit itself to another inquiry which almost certainly would not paint its work in a positive light.\n\nShattering the veil of secrecy over juvenile detention Photo shows A barbed wire fence pictured through trees against an orange sky For years WA's juvenile detention system has been shrouded in secrecy. That is about to change, as a coronial inquest examines the death of 16-year-old Cleveland Dodd while in the state government's care.\n\n\"I'm not going to add any more in relation to that, it's far too early,\" Corrective Services Commissioner Brad Royce said outside court.\n\nA state government spokesperson said it could not comment \"until the inquest's final report is delivered\".\n\nAction taken\n\nTo its credit, the department has not been waiting for that final report to take action \u2014 something Coroner Urquhart did acknowledge.\n\n\"We have had the opportunity throughout this inquest to understand the likely recommendations and we've acted on those,\" Commissioner Royce said.\n\n\"From the time of the start of this coronial process you would see that there have been a lot of changes and I'd like to acknowledge that the staff at Corrective Services and our significant partners have put a lot of effort into the change that you've seen across the estate.\n\nCleveland Dodd was just 16 when he died after self-harming in Unit 18. (Supplied: Family)\n\n\"We acknowledge that we have a lot of work to do and we'll continue to work hard in that space.\"\n\nIt is this change that Cleveland Dodd's family hope has a meaningful impact.\n\n\"If Cleveland had all the right help \u2026 maybe he'd be here today with us,\" his grandmother Roslyn Sullivan said outside court.\n\nRoslyn Sullivan says her family do not want another to go through what they have endured. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"All the things he went through, I wouldn't want another child to go through that.\"\n\nNo closer to closure\n\nDespite the department's work, a key request of Cleveland's family \u2014 and what the coroner has flagged could be one of his key recommendations \u2014 remains just an idea.\n\nSince it opened there have been calls to close Unit 18, the argument being an adult prison will never be suitable to look after the state's most vulnerable youths.\n\nGerry Georgatos, a suicide prevention advocate who at one point worked inside youth detention, said the continued use of the \"concrete nightmare\" of Unit 18 meant all young people in detention were being failed.\n\n\"They have the most pronounced longings and yearnings,\" he said.\n\n\"Do not disown the children who need us most to Unit 18. Instead, invest in seasoned experience.\"\n\nThe government has said it is doing that, but has maintained it cannot close the facility until a replacement is built, because it needs two distinct locations to manage young people in detention, lest the chaos that led to the opening of Unit 18 be repeated.\n\nCoroner Urquhart is still weighing up whether to recommend Unit 18 at Casuarina be closed. (ABC News)\n\nThe government promised to do that in late 2023, the month after Cleveland died.\n\nBut the government is yet to allocate the project more than $11.5 million in last month's state budget \u2014 money it announced nearly a year ago for planning and early site works.\n\nThat's not enough to satisfy Cleveland's family and those desperate for change.\n\nWhile not directly addressed by Coroner Urquhart, he did note he is still weighing up whether to recommend Unit 18 be closed when he hands down his final report.\n\n\"Everything must be done to minimise the risk of another death of a child in youth detention in Western Australia,\" he said in closing the inquest's hearings yesterday.\n\n\" I sincerely hope that those responsible for implementing the recommendations I ultimately make will have the resolve and the commitment to make them happen. \"\n\nThe ultimate test for this inquest \u2014 and any processes that follow it \u2014 is whether they result in real, lasting change in WA's long-troubled youth justice system.\n\nFormer inspector of custodial services Neil Morgan wrote in 2017: \"For the nine years I have been in this job, Banksia Hill has lurched from crisis to partial recovery and then back into crisis.\"\n\nOnly time will tell if that cycle will be broken this time around.\n\nAnd while a specific examination into what went wrong at the department is not essential, it certainly wouldn't hurt efforts to deliver meaningful change.",

The jury has since been sent home for the day and will return on Wednesday, local time.\n\nThe judge said the jury had communicated with him via a note near the end of its second day of deliberations.\n\nThe note said the jury had reached a verdict on two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, the judge said.\n\nBut on the charge of racketeering, he said, the jury note read: \"We have jurors with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\"\n\nThe judge noted that juries had a right to deliver a partial verdict, but given these jurors only started deliberating a day earlier, he wanted them to continue for now.\n\nJanice Combs, the mother of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, sat through her son's seven-week trial. (Reuters: Kylie Cooper)\n\nMr Combs had pleaded not guilty to all five counts. The 55-year-old, a former billionaire known for elevating hip hop music in American culture, could face life in prison if convicted of sex trafficking or racketeering.\n\nBefore Judge Subramanian read the jury's note, Mr Combs rubbed his eyes and rested his face against his palm while seated at the defence table with his lawyers huddled around him.\n\nDiddy and Weinstein cases test the limits and legacy of #MeToo Photo shows A composite image of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Harvey Weinstein.

Two of Mr Combs's other defence lawyers put their arms around each other. At one point, lead defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo stepped away from the huddle, returned with a piece of paper and handed it to Mr Combs.\n\nMr Combs's mother and several of his children returned to the courtroom after the judge announced the jury had reached a partial verdict.\n\nIt followed a seven-week trial in which two of the music mogul's former girlfriends testified that he physically and sexually abused them.\n\nProsecutors said Mr Combs was charged with racketeering because he used his business empire to force the women to take part in marathon sexual encounters known as \"freak-offs\".\n\nIt is is the most complicated of the charges against Mr Combs because it requires the jury to decide not only whether he ran a \"racketeering enterprise\", but also whether he was involved in committing a range of offences including kidnapping and arson.\n\nFamily and domestic violence support services: If you need help immediately call emergency services on triple-0 1800 Respect National Helpline: 1800 737 732\n\nWomen's Crisis Line: 1800 811 811\n\nMen's Referral Service: 1300 766 491\n\nLifeline: 131 114\n\nThe charge falls under the US's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \u2014 commonly referred to as \"RICO\" \u2014 which is best known for being used in organised crime and drug cartel cases.\n\nGiggles, scuffles and trial by TikTok: The Diddy courtroom circus Photo shows A drawing of Sean Combs, wearing a pale blue jumper, making a heart sign with his hands while standing in court.

        "text": "\u201cIf they were doing their job properly our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost. \u201cThe board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame,\u201d he wrote. On Friday, Trump urged Powell - whose term as chair expires next May - to resign, and said he would only pick a Powell successor who will cut US rates. Trump\u2019s verbal assault on Powell, who he described as a \u201cstubborn mule\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s previously said Powell is a bad person, stupid, terrible, a numbskull, an idiot and suffering from Trump derangement syndrome \u2013 has intensified since the US central bank chief made it clear after last month\u2019s Fed meeting, that the board would wait for the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs before making any move on rates.\n\nSo far, there have been only very minor signs that the tariffs are impacting the US inflation rate, but that is to be expected. In place, to date, are the 10 per cent baseline tariff on all imports to the US, along with some specific tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminium. The \u201cbig ones\u201d \u2013 the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs tailored to individual countries\u2019 exports to the US -- won\u2019t be unveiled until next Wednesday and could take months to show up in inflation data. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holding up the note from Trump to Fed chair Jerome Powell written on a list of central bank rates worldwide, during Monday\u2019s press briefing at] the White House, Credit: AP The risk of cutting rates prematurely and then seeing a tariff-driven spike in the inflation rate explains why the Fed has adopted a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to its monetary policies. The relatively strong US economy and job market at present provide no obvious downside to being patient. Trump is impatient \u2013 he wants the Fed to cut its target for the federal funds rate from its current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent to between 1 and 2 per cent \u2013 because he\u2019s about to inject a debt-funded fiscal boost into the economy.\n\nThe US Senate narrowly approved Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Tuesday (thanks to vice president JD Vance\u2019s casting vote) after a marathon 24-hour session. Loading That bill, whose measures and cost might be changed when it returns to the House, would add between $US3.3 trillion ($5 trillion) and $US4 trillion ($6.1 trillion) to US deficits and debt over the next decade. With the interest costs on US government debt already running at about $US1 trillion a year, the new debt generated by that bill will add hundreds of billions more \u2013 unless the Fed cuts rates. Hence Trump\u2019s comment that hundred of billions of dollars are being lost because of its inaction. The problem for the Fed, and Trump, is that the central bank\u2019s mandate is to promote price stability and maximum employment, not to enable the US government to borrow more cheaply.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to coerce Powell and his fellow board members into cutting rates to help him politically, if they succeeded, would undermine the Fed\u2019s credibility and the trust in it as an institution independent of politics and politicians. Loading That independence is important for the Fed\u2019s ability to influence inflation expectations and guide and reassure financial market participants that its policies are consistent and predictable, which is fundamental to financial stability. The risk for America is that, if investors see the Fed\u2019s independence compromised and its policies driven by political considerations, there\u2019d be an exodus of capital. Given the deluge of US debt that will need to be financed and refinanced in the bond market, that would itself push interest rates up. Confidence in the Fed and other respected central banks rests on their predictability, and a conviction that their monetary policy settings will either be neutral or, when necessary, counter-cyclical to keep inflation rates under control.\n\nPro-cyclical settings \u2013 policies influenced by the demands of politicians who face relatively short political cycles and who want growth regardless of the longer-term consequences \u2013 would risk igniting inflation. Trump might want a rate-cutter in Powell\u2019s chair but, if that were to eventuate, it would be damaging to the Fed, the bond market and the US dollar, which just experienced its weakest first half of the year in more than half a century. US bond funds have had their biggest net outflows since the pandemic. Trump\u2019s trade wars are being blamed for both. Loading While there has been speculation that Trump will soon appoint a \u201cshadow chair\u201d whose presence (and utterings) could confuse markets and undermine Powell, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said it is possible that the White House will nominate a candidate to the board in October or November. Powell is in the chair until May and has no plans to vacate until then and Trump, despite continually musing about it, has no power to remove him any earlier. But the term of one of the Fed\u2019s governors, Adriana Kugler, ends in January and Trump\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d chair could be inserted into the board then.\n\nThe credibility of Powell\u2019s successor would, of course, be compromised if they were seen as a Trump stooge - although Trump\u2019s expectations of the next chair\u2019s influence might be a tad unrealistic. There are 19 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, and 12 voting members. The committee, which actually makes rate decisions, can elect its own chair. One person, even the Fed chair, can\u2019t dictate outcomes and a Fed chair whose public commentary was at odds with the bank\u2019s decisions would only confuse markets and damage the institution. Powell is fortunate that even the US Supreme Court seems to believe Trump can\u2019t force him out of the Fed. President Donald Trump was asked if he wanted to deport Elon Musk: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take a look.\u201d Credit: AP Where Trump can threaten Elon Musk (a naturalised US citizen) with deportation to South Africa, or siccing Musk\u2019s former DOGE colleagues on him, his companies and the billions of dollars of taxpayer support they receive each year, all Trump can do to Powell really is continue to abuse him.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size If you read the comments under any story about free-to-air news and current affairs, you will find the same mix of complaints: Untrustworthy, too woke, too left, too right-wing and, inevitably, \u201cbring back The Drum\u201d. So launching a new nightly news program, one that promises in-depth coverage and big-picture reporting, is a tough ask: How do you build trust with an audience that is already side-eyeing how news is delivered? It\u2019s a question journalists Denham Hitchcock and Amelia Brace hope to answer as the hosts of Network 10\u2019s new hour-long nightly news program, 10 News+. \u201c[Building trust] that\u2019s difficult because that requires time,\u201d says Hitchcock. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying from the start is that [trust] is at the core of this program, so you will see that in the reporting and the questioning and the topics that we choose, I think that will change people\u2019s opinions because we won\u2019t just be taking one side, we\u2019ll be questioning both sides equally, and when people see that, I think it will change their opinion.\u201d Brace agrees: \u201cIt is just about treating our audience with respect. People are intelligent. They do have their own thoughts and they do have their own opinions. So it\u2019s just about telling both sides of the story and then letting people decide what they think of that, not telling them what they think about it.\u201d Amelia Brace and Denham Hitchcock at the 10 News+ desk at Ten\u2019s studios in Pyrmont. 10 News+ is at the heart of Ten\u2019s bid to reshape its early evening viewing. The state-based local news is broadcast from 5pm, followed by 10 News+ at 6pm, and then game show Deal or No Deal at 7pm. Gone is The Project, which finished last week after a 16-year run. In another bold move, 10 News+ will be broadcast on Spotify, as well as on YouTube and 10Play, in what Ten says is a \u201cworld first for commercial TV news\u201d. It is an everything, everywhere all at once approach. And it\u2019s also a sharp U-turn from The Project, which mixed news reporting with light entertainment and comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople just want their news straight up,\u201d says Brace. \u201cThere\u2019s been, I think, a drift in recent years towards opinion or sensationalism, and in some media even, I think bias. And people kind of leant into that for a while and enjoyed the change, but now people are fed up with it. Denham Hitchcock and Amelia Brace bring a long history of news reporting to 10 News+. Credit: Wolter Peeters \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be told what to think or how to think. They just want their information and then they can make up their own minds. People are smart. They don\u2019t need to be told what to think.\u201d So what does that mean in practice? On the basis of Monday night\u2019s first episode, it was an exclusive interview with Debbie Voulgaris, the convicted drug smuggler and Melbourne mother who is currently serving a 15-year prison term in Taiwan, and another interview with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Loading Both stories were longer than most standard news segments and, apart from covering a shark attack on the far north coast of NSW, the show steered clear of the kind of local fracas that are grist to the daily news mill. It\u2019s an approach, says Hitchcock, that melds the best of Australia\u2019s big TV news hitters: 7.30 and Four Corners on the ABC, 60 Minutes on Nine and Spotlight on Seven. \u201cOur show is a hybrid of almost all of them,\u201d says Hitchcock. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a story in our first two days, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be Monday [the Voulgaris story], that will be a story that 60 Minutes, Spotlight or Four Corners would kill for. So we\u2019re hoping viewers will come to us because they\u2019ll get the news of the day, they\u2019ll get the things that matter, but they\u2019ll also see something fresh.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrace, 37, and Hitchcock, 48, come to 10 News+ as familiar faces from Seven and Nine, respectively, where they built their reputations as foreign correspondents, with stints in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. They both began their careers at Seven \u2013 Brace in regional Queensland and Hitchcock in Sydney. Brace remembers her first day on the job at Seven, when she was a university student on a competitive internship, which involved covering a fatal bus crash. \u201cI went out shadowing a reporter,\u201d she says. \u201cI kind of really got thrown in the thick of it.\u201d It\u2019s been a wild ride since then, with Brace covering everything from the drought in rural Queensland to being part of a world-record skydive live on air (\u201cIt was absolutely terrifying. I cried in my goggles\u201d). In 2020, she won a Walkley Award for her coverage of the protests outside the White House, where she was hit with a baton by police. \u201cYou can\u2019t cover these things from a bureau or even from a block back,\u201d says Brace. \u201cBecause what is happening to these people is happening on the front line, and you have to be standing there, and you have to sit with your own eyes so you can actually stand up on camera or in Congress, as I had to, and say what happened wasn\u2019t right. Sometimes it\u2019s your job to say, \u2018I saw that and that wasn\u2019t OK.\u2019\u201d Hitchcock, meanwhile, got his start in the office of the now defunct current affairs show Today Tonight when he was 18 years old. \u201cI was answering the phones and filling the biscuit barrel,\u201d he says. \u201cBut within six months, I was a researcher, and within another three months after that, I was a producer at 18. It was fast, but from there I\u2019ve done almost every job \u2013 researcher, producer, editor, reporter, correspondent, all sorts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Brace, he\u2019s has the kind of globe-trotting news career that makes great TV \u2013 reporting from the frontlines of Syria and Iraq, covering the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines \u2013 but it\u2019s the quieter story of Sharn McNeill, who was only 30 when she was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, that he names as one of his favourites. \u201cIt always makes me teary whenever I even describe it to anybody,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those stories of human endurance and positivity that always stays with me.\u201d The team from 10 News+ (from left) 10 NEWS+ Samantha Butler, Brianna Parkins, Angela Bishop, Hugh Riminton, Amelia Brace, Denham Hitchcock, Ursula Heger, Ashleigh Raper, Bill Hogan and Carrie-Anne Greenbank. With so long in business, do either of them see a difference in how news is reported or consumed today? Loading \u201cI don\u2019t see a change in the stories of people interested in, just in the way they consume it and the speed in which they consume it,\u201d says Hitchcock. \u201cThose big stories used to happen and [you] used to be able to chew on it for a whole week. Now it could be the most immense story that you\u2019ve ever seen, and three days later, we\u2019re on to something else.\u201d Brace, meanwhile, thinks people are more overwhelmed than ever before by the \u201csheer amount of information out there\u201d and this is what leads to the rise in misinformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just selective reporting when you blatantly just tell one side of a story,\u201d says Brace. \u201cThat side is not untrue, but it\u2019s dangerous to do that, I think. I bump into people in real life regularly who say, \u2018Did you hear this?\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018But did you hear this?\u2019 And it\u2019s not that I\u2019m on one side or the other. I just get really annoyed when they have no idea that that\u2019s only half the story.\u201d Amelia Brace and Denham Hitchock interview Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the first episode of 10 News+ on Monday night. The US, famously, is home to Fox News, which proudly wears its bias on its sleeve. Do either of them think there is that type of biased reporting in Australia? \u201cWe have more of it than we used to,\u201d says Brace. \u201cI genuinely think that perhaps 10 years ago, we had a really balanced media with very little tolerance for bias. I remember maybe around the Kevin Rudd kind of time \u2013 because I\u2019m very politically focused \u2013 there started to be some headlines and some things said, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Hm, that\u2019s interesting reporting.\u2019 I just feel like it\u2019s grown over the years, where we now have certain outlets that you just know they\u2019re one side or the other. And I really don\u2019t like that.\u201d Loading Of course, it\u2019s not just bias or misinformation that modern broadcast news has to deal with. The fickle beast that is ratings will probably have more of an effect on 10 News+\u2019s future than any story they choose to do. A dramatic drop in ratings was one of the reasons given for The Project\u2019s axing, so what happens when, say, four weeks from now, 10 News+ isn\u2019t clicking and it\u2019s suggested they start chasing more sensational local stories? \u201cIt\u2019ll be a collective decision, the stories that we chase for the day,\u201d says Hitchock. \u201cSo that\u2019ll be Dan Sutton, who\u2019s the executive producer, and Martin White, who\u2019s the vice president [of news on Ten]. Those two will be keeping a keen eye on the show, and then Amelia and I, of course, will have heavy input as well.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "With ministerial consent to the title transfer under its belt through Half Moon, Marmota now owns 90 per cent of any minerals found at Golden Moon, including gold. The deal excludes opals, iron ore and palygorskite, which is also known as Fuller\u2019s Earth.\n\nUnder the joint venture terms, Half Moon will free carry Coombedown until a decision to mine is made. Marmota will manage the joint venture through Half Moon.\n\nUnlike the extensively drilled Aurora deposit, the Golden Moon ground has been subject to only minimal drilling. It had not been tested for six years until Marmota kicked off its sub-surface probing at Campfire Bore in September last year.\n\nMarmota Limited chairman Dr Colin Rose said: \u201cWe are delighted that the title transfers of these core gold deposits/tenements have now been formally completed, ticking off another box on Marmota\u2019s Gawler gold project. The Golden Moon JV heralds a new era of gold exploration and resource growth in the Gawler Craton. Work started on these assets under the guidance of Dominion, which made the discovery of the Challenger gold mine.\u201d\n\nDr Rose said the Golden Moon joint venture has cleared the deck, after some delays, with a clean new structure now completed.\n\nMarmota\u2019s first drilling program at Campfire Bore put in 86 reverse circulation holes for 11,690m by mid-October last year. The company immediately began planning follow-up work after seeing considerable growth potential at the prospect, encouraged by the December discovery of high-grade gold in multiple holes.\n\nCampfire Bore\u2019s best results from its first phase of drilling included an early 4m assaying 16 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 56m below surface and 16m going 2.7g/t gold from 35m, including 4m running 8.6g/t gold from 42m.\n\nOther results include bonanza grades up to 1m assaying 107g/t gold from 57m depth, five other intersections above 20g/t gold and 13 new intersections exceeding 10 g/t gold, including 5m going 12g/t, 3m at 11g/t and 3m at 10g/t gold.\n\nDuring an internal review of Greenewood\u2019s exploration history, Marmota noted previous third-party drilling results from 2016 and 2017 that include multiple intersections of more than 20g/t gold in six holes close to surface. These include 1m at 53g/t gold from 30m, 1m at 37g/t gold from 48m and 1m at 29g/t from 31m.\n\nA further three holes delivered 1m assaying 23g/t from 24m, 1m at 23g/t from 23m and 1m going 21g/t from 41m.\n\nThe proximity of the Golden Moon joint venture deposits to the company\u2019s Aurora Tank project brings development and logistical synergies and benefits.\n\nAurora Tank is characterised by multiple shallow high-grade hits and exhibits outstanding potential for low-cost, low-capex, open-pit, heap-leach production.\n\nWhile recent drilling has yielded a host of high-grade gold intersections and indicates significant potential for expansion, Marmota is focusing on completing its metallurgical test work and a scoping study and producing a maiden resource in the next six months.\n\nWith promising new ground close to Aurora Tank, the company now has a solid portfolio of gold deposits in the Gawler Craton to follow up.\n\nIt has already identified new high-grade gold extensions in first stage drilling at Campfire Bore. Through Half Moon, Marmota also owns all the Typhoon and Monsoon deposits, which are part of the Western Gawler Craton joint venture project.\n\nIf Marmota\u2019s imminent drilling at Greenewood can replicate its Aurora Tank and Campfire Bore successes, the company will have won a uniqiue trifecta \u2013 or something like this\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

        "text": "As the new financial year dawns, many Australians are eagerly awaiting some much-needed funds in the form of a tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost half of Australia (47 per cent) is expecting a tax refund, according to a survey of 1,015 people from financial comparison site Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf those expecting a refund from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), more than half (52 per cent) plan to put the extra cash straight into savings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the cost of living continues to bite, 19 per cent said they would use the extra funds to pay for household bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a small portion said they'd use it for discretionary spending like holidays (7 per cent) or shopping sprees (5 per cent), while 6 per cent plan to put it towards their mortgage.\n\n\n\nWant to file your tax return now? Not so fast\n\nWhile many Australians might be eager to get their refunds quickly, it might be better to wait, says H&R Block's director of tax communications, Mark Chapman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are really two reasons [to wait]. First, the ATO isn't even going to process refunds until the second week of tax time,\" Chapman told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Secondly, the pre-filled information which the ATO relies upon to pre-fill your tax return \u2014 provided by employers, banks, health funds \u2014 is often not available for the first couple of weeks of July.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Tax time tips & ASX enjoys above average returns in FY25 SBS News 30/06/2025 19:24 English\n\nIf you're completing your tax return by yourself, you may be relying on the ATO's pre-fill function, which automatically inputs things like your income, health insurance, and bank interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it takes time for all these different organisations to finalise all of their financial statements and report that information to the ATO,\" said Sarah Megginson, personal finance expert at Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your employer has until 14 July each year to finalise your payroll data and submit it with the ATO, and without this information, it's really hard to complete your return.\"\n\n\n\nJump the gun, and you'll risk missing important income details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you lodge in the first two weeks, you run a real chance of basically missing income from an employer or bank interest and then having to do an amendment later on,\" Chapman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very easy to miss some form of income if you've got three or four bank accounts, all of which will pay interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've only got one or two of them on the ATO's pre-fill, it's very easy to miss the other ones \u2014 so it's potentially dangerous completing a tax return without that pre-filled information.\"\n\n\n\nSo, when's the best time to file your tax return?\n\nChapman recommends lodging your return in the third week of July, when pre-filled information is usually complete and the ATO has started processing refunds.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you're expecting to owe tax, it could be worth holding off until the very last moment \u2014 31 October if you self-lodge, or 15 May next year if you use a tax agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your tax liability isn't crystallised until your tax return is processed. So the later it's processed, the later your payment is due,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTips for a smooth tax return\n\nDon't rely on pre-filled information. Always use your own records as the primary source, Chapman warned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't assume the ATO pre-filled data is correct or complete, particularly if you're lodging early,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also advised double-checking the basics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Returns routinely get held up at the ATO because there's some kind of data mismatch between what you've reported and what information the ATO has. I'm not talking about tax information \u2014 I mean your name or your address.\"\n\n\n\nIf you've moved during the year, changed your name, or updated your bank details, make sure this is reflected with the ATO beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, your return could fall into a \"void\" and be delayed, Chapman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while it should perhaps go without saying, make sure your bank account details are correct if you want to actually receive your refund.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "More than one third of people in Tuvalu want to apply for an Australian visa, as the tiny Pacific nation faces rising sea levels and other impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government opened an inaugural ballot on 16 June that allows Tuvaluans to register their interest in a special visa program, created under the terms of the Falepili Union treaty between the two countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visa will allow up to 280 Tuvalu nationals each year to live, work and study in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of Tuvalu's population of roughly 11,000 people, more than a third have begun the process of applying.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the latest official figures cited by Reuters, 1,124 people have registered as of Sunday, with family members bringing the total to 4,052.\n\n\n\nCommunities facing 'real challenges'\n\nFor some time, scientists have feared climate change may make the Pacific Island nation uninhabitable within 80 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050, NASA scientists project daily tides will submerge half the main atoll of Funafuti \u2014 home to 60 per cent of Tuvalu's residents, where villagers cling to a strip of land as narrow as 20 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuvalu's mean elevation is just two metres above sea level.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has experienced a sea level rise of 15cm over the past three decades \u2014 one-and-a-half times the global average. It has built seven hectares of artificial land, and is planning more, which it hopes will stay above the tides until 2100.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the young people who could outlive their own country\n\n'Alopi Latukefu, director of the Global Centre for Social Justice and Advocacy Leadership, said climate change is already being felt across Tuvalu's nine atolls scattered across the Pacific between Australia and Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing these communities faced with real challenges in the community from the perspective of not just inundation from the sea level rise, but also in terms of food security, water security in these communities, the impact from regular events \u2014 whether they be king tides or more serious events \u2014 that are creating a very difficult situation,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's important to understand that not everyone wants to leave Tuvalu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision to leave is a very big one and a very important one, and one which is tied to a range of other factors as well to support their families, to provide a pathway for a future, to have access to education, to have access to things that are part of the opportunity that Australia represents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some may feel they have little choice.\n\n\n\nA 'very generous visa'\n\nProfessor Stephen Howes, director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University, said those selected for the visa will have significant rights to live, work and study in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a very generous visa,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most migrants to Australia have to endure a waiting period of several years before they're eligible for benefits. But that's not the case for migrants under this visa.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowes said successful applicants would have access to Medicare and others including family benefits and support to study.\n\n\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (second from left) and Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano (right) announcing the Falepili Union treaty in 2023. Source: AAP / Ben McKay Professor Jane McAdam, director of the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at UNSW Sydney, described the Falepili Union treaty as the world's first bilateral agreement that references climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The visa itself doesn't mention the words climate change at all, but the treaty pursuant to which it was created is framed very much around the existential threat that climate change poses in our region,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was an element that the government of Tuvalu specifically requested from Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the treaty in 2023 , Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the agreement \"reflects Tuvalu's special circumstances as a low-lying nation that's particularly impacted, its very existence, by the threat of climate change\".\n\n\n\n'It's not a climate visa'\n\nThe pact has several elements, including climate mitigation and adaptation, the migration pathway, and security.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowes said while the visa will benefit those selected in the lottery, Australia has also gained some strategic advantages through the Falepili Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What Australia got out of the agreement was a sort of veto power over Tuvalu's security arrangements \u2014 or, specifically, security partnerships,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Under the agreement, Tuvalu has to seek Australia's permission before entering into an agreement with the third country in relation to security, and that's clearly aimed at China.\"\n\n\n\nLatukefu welcomed the new visa, but said Australia needs to take stronger action to address climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a climate visa, let's be very clear about this. It's under the Falepili [Union] treaty ... a treaty of friendship with Tuvalu,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's often referred to as a climate visa, but it's one that is not framed in that context. That's partly because of Australia's need to not frame things in that context because of our own interests.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO World Bank head sees climate change devastation in Tuvalu SBS News 08/09/2024 04:56 English\n\nLatukefu said it's important that Tuvaluans are supported to maintain their connection to their lands and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAdam agrees ongoing mobility will be important feature of the new visa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the proof will be in the pudding in terms of what actually happens when the first, second, third groups of people arrive \u2014 how well supported they feel once they're here, how much they are facilitated to create their own cultural facilities and community supports here,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBallot applications close on 18 July, with an annual cap of 280 visas designed to ensure migration to Australia does not cause brain drain from Tuvalu, officials said when the treaty was announced in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from Reuters\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "At a school in Sydney's northern beaches, the sound of prayer, drums and chatter fills the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor months, students at the Tibetan Language and Culture School at Mackellar Girls Campus have been preparing a traditional dance. They're set to perform at NSW parliament to honour the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday this Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhuntsok Dolma Tentso says it's a chance to connect with their culture and enjoy cultural freedoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kids in Tibet don't have the opportunity to go to Tibetan schools like us. They're forced into colonial boarding schools and integrated into Chinese lifestyles,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But here in Australia, we have the opportunity to learn our culture, religion and language, which I think is really important so we can continue the Tibetan cause.\"\n\n\n\nThe Tibetan Language and Culture School students in Sydney rehearse a traditional Tibetan dance. Source: SBS News For Tibetan human rights campaigner Kyinzom Dhongdue, the upcoming celebrations bring \"both hope and urgency\", with the future of Tibetan spiritual leadership remaining uncertain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama will address a major three-day gathering of Buddhist religious figures this week, as his followers await details about his succession.\n\n\n\nWho is the Dalai Lama?\n\nHis Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn to a farming family on 6 July 1935 in north-eastern Tibet, he was recognised as the \"reincarnation\" of the previous Dalai Lama at the age of two.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese communist rule. Since then, he has been living in Dharamshala, in northern India.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama also traditionally carries political and cultural significance in the region. In 2011, he handed his political role to a democratically elected government, ending a 368-year-old tradition of being both the spiritual and temporal head of Tibetans.\n\n\n\nHow is the Dalai Lama's successor chosen?\n\nTraditionally, the Dalai Lama is identified after death, with senior monks seeking a child believed to be their reincarnation, guided by dreams, visions and ritual tests.\n\n\n\nKevin Carrico, a senior lecturer in Chinese studies at Monash University, said: \"The idea is that after one Dalai Lama passes away, the spirit of that Dalai Lama is reincarnated in a child born within one year of the Dalai Lama's death.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the practice when Tibetans were able to make their own decisions about reincarnation and succession, Carrico said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since the incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China in the 1950s \u2014 despite various guarantees that there would be no interference in the political or religious systems of Tibet \u2014 it would be a dramatic understatement to say there has been unprecedented interference in the political and religious systems of Tibet,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhy is China involved?\n\nZo\u00eb Bedford, executive officer of the Australia Tibet Council, said the Tibetan diaspora is \"very anxious\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So much depends on His Holiness the Dalai Lama,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reason for such high anxiety is because we know that the Chinese government is trying to interfere with the reincarnation process for the next Dalai Lama,\" she said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Who will be the next Dalai Lama? SBS News 30/06/2025 07:18 English\n\nIn his memoir released in March, the Dalai Lama stated for the first time that his successor would be born in the \"free world\", signalling a reincarnation outside China's control.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has previously only said that he could reincarnate outside Tibet, possibly in India, where he lives in exile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since the purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor, the new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama \u2014 that is, to be the voice for universal compassion, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and the symbol of Tibet embodying the aspirations of the Tibetan people \u2014 will continue,\" the Dalai Lama stated in his memoir.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut China views the Dalai Lama as a separatist and political exile who has \"no right to represent the Tibetan people at all\", a spokesperson for China's foreign minister said when asked about the book during a news conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina insists it will choose his successor, but the Dalai Lama has said any successor named by China would not be respected.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina's foreign ministry has previously said reincarnation of living Buddhas, including the Dalai Lama, \"must comply with Chinese laws and regulations\".\n\n\n\n'The stakes are high'\n\nDhongdue said the Dalai Lama has taken \"proactive steps\" to protect the reincarnation process.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE China says Australia is plagued by racism and hypocritical after Tibet, Xinjiang raised at UN\n\n\"It is a political reality that has forced us to protect the institution and the integrity of this tradition, free from Chinese interference,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While we have complete faith in His Holiness and the Tibetan Buddhist system in managing this challenge \u2026 the next few years and decades will be critical for Tibet and the stakes are high \u2014 politically, culturally, and spiritually.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrico believes we could be \"looking at the very real possibility of a conflict between a sort of Tibetan-chosen successor and a Chinese-chosen successor\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That would obviously create extreme tensions in Tibet and in global society more broadly,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDhongdue said this would be \"nonsensical and dangerous\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Beijing has to know that this is not going to work. The Tibetan people's bond with His Holiness will always remain strong. If Beijing tries to install a fake Dalai Lama \u2026 that person will not be accepted by the Tibetan people as well as the global Buddhist community \u2014 and neither should the international community,\" she said.\n\n\n\nIn 1995, following the death of the Panchen Lama \u2014 the second-highest Tibetan Buddhist figure \u2014 the Dalai Lama recognised a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was taken into what Chinese authorities described as protective custody and has not been seen since. Another child was named the reincarnated.\n\n\n\n\n\nBedford expects \"great concern\" about the safety of any future successor not aligned with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If another person or an adult is chosen to be the successor of the Dalai Lama, there'll be concern about their welfare,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat else has the Dalai Lama said?\n\nThe Dalai Lama has previously said the line of spiritual leaders might end with him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has not ruled out the possibility of an adult \u2014 or a woman \u2014 as his successor, controversially saying in a 2019 interview that \"if a female Dalai Lama comes, she should be more attractive\". He later apologised and clarified the remarks.\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama will turn 90 on Sunday and has said he would consult senior monks and others at this time to share possible clues on where his successor could be found following his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rest of my life I will dedicate for the benefit of others, as much as possible, as extensive as possible,\" the Dalai Lama told a gathering of his followers on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There will be some kind of a framework within which we can talk about the continuation of the institution of the Dalai Lamas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDolma Tsering Teykhang, the deputy speaker of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile in Dharamshala, said it was important for the world to hear directly from the Dalai Lama on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China is trying to grab this institution ... for its political purpose,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want the incarnation of the Dalai Lama to be born not only for the survival of Tibet as a distinct culture, religion and nation, but also for the well-being of the whole humanity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe religious conference this week, being held for the first time since 2019, will be attended by more than 100 Tibetan Buddhist leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Reuters\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points Emergency crews on standby as east coast storm hits\n\nHigh-risk Australians eligible for free lung-cancer screening\n\nCarlos Alcaraz beats Fabio Fognini at Wimbledon\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's called a \"bomb cyclone\" is set to dump more than 100 millimetres of rain in the space of hours on Australia's east coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteorologists say the fast-developing storm Sydney will impact significant stretches of the New South Wales coast today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's already sparked heavy rain, strong winds and hazardous surf - and up to 120 millimetres of rain is expected to lash Greater Sydney alone over the next six hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nSES state operations manager Dallas Burnes says emergency calls have already started to come through - as the weather system intensifies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the mid north coast region is an area of concern for emergency services because of the soil is still saturated from the May floods.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Reid - from the Bureau of Meteorology - says flash flooding is also a risk for communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is isolated heavy rainfall, which may lead to flash flooding along the coastal fringe, north of Ulladulla with six-hourly totals between 70-90 millimetres up to 120 millimetres in isolated locations in that six-hour period. Towns impacted include Armidale, Newcastle, Gosford, Sydney, Wollongong, Nowra and Batemans Bay. Locally, destructive wind gusts of 125 kilometres an hour - also possible from midday on Tuesday for exposed coastal areas between Bondi and Wollongong.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom today, Australians at high risk of developing lung cancer can undergo a screening test - free-of-charge through Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s first new national cancer screening program in nearly 20 years is being rolled out, targeting people aged between 50 and 70 who have a history of smoking.\n\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are in particular, being encouraged to use the screening program, as lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among First Nations Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO of the Lung Foundation Australia, Mark Brooke, says early screening aims to improve the survival rate outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia stands as leaders globally. We will be one of the first countries in the world to have a National Lung Cancer Screening Program that will look across Australia, and particularly because it's been co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will support those people who have often been forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nVictorian premier Jacinta Allan says the state's Voice to parliament won't be written into its constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premier says it will not require constitutional change, unlike the failed Federal voice proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has confirmed the First People's Assembly will be a permanent fixture and will be made up of 33 elected members who will provide advice on laws and policies that affect Indigenous communities in Victoria, from health and education to crime and development.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Allan says the voice to parliament - as well as ongoing treaty negotiations - aim to enable First Nations people to have a better say in the policies that affect them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The treaty process and outcome is grounded in that pretty simple common sense approach, that when you listen to people who are affected by policies and programs, when you involve them in the processes, you get better outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are renewed calls for a Gaza ceasefire, after another deadly 24 hours in the enclave.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal officials and medical staff say Israeli attacks have killed at least 72 Palestinians, including 21 people at a crowded seafront rest area near Gaza City.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Israel's military issued evacuation orders for those in northern Gaza, as it warned of intensifying military activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric says there needs to be a swift resolution to end the violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Secretary-General is alarmed by the new evacuation orders in northern Gaza, which have once again displaced tens of thousands of people. The Secretary-General condemns the continued loss of civilian life resulting from Israeli airstrikes and other attacks. All parties must comply fully with international law at all times. The Secretary-General welcomes the continued efforts by the mediators and reiterates his appeal to the parties to urgently reach a permanent ceasefire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a US official says President Donald Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks at the White House next Monday.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn tennis, Carlos Alcaraz has survived Wimbledon's hottest-ever opening day, eventually triumphing against Fabio Fognini in five sets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith air temperatures soaring to 32 degrees Celsius, the defending champion needed more than four hours to subdue veteran Fognini.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly two defending men's champions had ever lost in the first round at Wimbledon, but there were moments when Alcaraz looked in danger of joining compatriot Manuel Santana on that short list.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last set was interrupted, after a spectator became unwell in the heat and required assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcaraz charmed the crowd by offering his water bottle to the distressed fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he was nervous before the match - and he is relieved to get through to the next round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been playing really, really tough matches the last year, the last year in this tournament. Just really proud that I always find a way. Today I did it, even though Fabio was playing a great tennis. Just really proud to overcome the problem, to overcome the tough moments, and found my way.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan Thompson is the only Australian to advance to the second round at Wimbledon, after day one of the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old beat Czech player, Vit Kopriva in a match lasting three hours and 37 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven other Australians were eliminated: including Ajla Tomljanovic, Olivia Gadecki, Chris O\u2019Connell, and James Duckworth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexei Popyrin lost to English wildcard Arthur Fery - Fery's first win in a grand slam.\n\n\n\n",

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holding up the note from Trump to Fed chair Jerome Powell written on a list of central bank rates worldwide, during Monday\u2019s press briefing at] the White House, Credit: AP The risk of cutting rates prematurely and then seeing a tariff-driven spike in the inflation rate explains why the Fed has adopted a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to its monetary policies. The relatively strong US economy and job market at present provide no obvious downside to being patient. Trump is impatient \u2013 he wants the Fed to cut its target for the federal funds rate from its current range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent to between 1 and 2 per cent \u2013 because he\u2019s about to inject a debt-funded fiscal boost into the economy.\n\nThe US Senate narrowly approved Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Tuesday (thanks to vice president JD Vance\u2019s casting vote) after a marathon 24-hour session. Loading That bill, whose measures and cost might be changed when it returns to the House, would add between $US3.3 trillion ($5 trillion) and $US4 trillion ($6.1 trillion) to US deficits and debt over the next decade. With the interest costs on US government debt already running at about $US1 trillion a year, the new debt generated by that bill will add hundreds of billions more \u2013 unless the Fed cuts rates. Hence Trump\u2019s comment that hundred of billions of dollars are being lost because of its inaction. The problem for the Fed, and Trump, is that the central bank\u2019s mandate is to promote price stability and maximum employment, not to enable the US government to borrow more cheaply.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to coerce Powell and his fellow board members into cutting rates to help him politically, if they succeeded, would undermine the Fed\u2019s credibility and the trust in it as an institution independent of politics and politicians. Loading That independence is important for the Fed\u2019s ability to influence inflation expectations and guide and reassure financial market participants that its policies are consistent and predictable, which is fundamental to financial stability. The risk for America is that, if investors see the Fed\u2019s independence compromised and its policies driven by political considerations, there\u2019d be an exodus of capital. Given the deluge of US debt that will need to be financed and refinanced in the bond market, that would itself push interest rates up. Confidence in the Fed and other respected central banks rests on their predictability, and a conviction that their monetary policy settings will either be neutral or, when necessary, counter-cyclical to keep inflation rates under control.\n\nPro-cyclical settings \u2013 policies influenced by the demands of politicians who face relatively short political cycles and who want growth regardless of the longer-term consequences \u2013 would risk igniting inflation. Trump might want a rate-cutter in Powell\u2019s chair but, if that were to eventuate, it would be damaging to the Fed, the bond market and the US dollar, which just experienced its weakest first half of the year in more than half a century. US bond funds have had their biggest net outflows since the pandemic. Trump\u2019s trade wars are being blamed for both. Loading While there has been speculation that Trump will soon appoint a \u201cshadow chair\u201d whose presence (and utterings) could confuse markets and undermine Powell, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said it is possible that the White House will nominate a candidate to the board in October or November. Powell is in the chair until May and has no plans to vacate until then and Trump, despite continually musing about it, has no power to remove him any earlier. But the term of one of the Fed\u2019s governors, Adriana Kugler, ends in January and Trump\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d chair could be inserted into the board then.\n\nThe credibility of Powell\u2019s successor would, of course, be compromised if they were seen as a Trump stooge - although Trump\u2019s expectations of the next chair\u2019s influence might be a tad unrealistic. There are 19 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, and 12 voting members. The committee, which actually makes rate decisions, can elect its own chair. One person, even the Fed chair, can\u2019t dictate outcomes and a Fed chair whose public commentary was at odds with the bank\u2019s decisions would only confuse markets and damage the institution. Powell is fortunate that even the US Supreme Court seems to believe Trump can\u2019t force him out of the Fed. President Donald Trump was asked if he wanted to deport Elon Musk: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take a look.\u201d Credit: AP Where Trump can threaten Elon Musk (a naturalised US citizen) with deportation to South Africa, or siccing Musk\u2019s former DOGE colleagues on him, his companies and the billions of dollars of taxpayer support they receive each year, all Trump can do to Powell really is continue to abuse him.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size If you read the comments under any story about free-to-air news and current affairs, you will find the same mix of complaints: Untrustworthy, too woke, too left, too right-wing and, inevitably, \u201cbring back The Drum\u201d. So launching a new nightly news program, one that promises in-depth coverage and big-picture reporting, is a tough ask: How do you build trust with an audience that is already side-eyeing how news is delivered? It\u2019s a question journalists Denham Hitchcock and Amelia Brace hope to answer as the hosts of Network 10\u2019s new hour-long nightly news program, 10 News+. \u201c[Building trust] that\u2019s difficult because that requires time,\u201d says Hitchcock. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying from the start is that [trust] is at the core of this program, so you will see that in the reporting and the questioning and the topics that we choose, I think that will change people\u2019s opinions because we won\u2019t just be taking one side, we\u2019ll be questioning both sides equally, and when people see that, I think it will change their opinion.\u201d Brace agrees: \u201cIt is just about treating our audience with respect. People are intelligent. They do have their own thoughts and they do have their own opinions. So it\u2019s just about telling both sides of the story and then letting people decide what they think of that, not telling them what they think about it.\u201d Amelia Brace and Denham Hitchcock at the 10 News+ desk at Ten\u2019s studios in Pyrmont. 10 News+ is at the heart of Ten\u2019s bid to reshape its early evening viewing. The state-based local news is broadcast from 5pm, followed by 10 News+ at 6pm, and then game show Deal or No Deal at 7pm. Gone is The Project, which finished last week after a 16-year run. In another bold move, 10 News+ will be broadcast on Spotify, as well as on YouTube and 10Play, in what Ten says is a \u201cworld first for commercial TV news\u201d. It is an everything, everywhere all at once approach. And it\u2019s also a sharp U-turn from The Project, which mixed news reporting with light entertainment and comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople just want their news straight up,\u201d says Brace. \u201cThere\u2019s been, I think, a drift in recent years towards opinion or sensationalism, and in some media even, I think bias. And people kind of leant into that for a while and enjoyed the change, but now people are fed up with it. Denham Hitchcock and Amelia Brace bring a long history of news reporting to 10 News+. Credit: Wolter Peeters \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be told what to think or how to think. They just want their information and then they can make up their own minds. People are smart. They don\u2019t need to be told what to think.\u201d So what does that mean in practice? On the basis of Monday night\u2019s first episode, it was an exclusive interview with Debbie Voulgaris, the convicted drug smuggler and Melbourne mother who is currently serving a 15-year prison term in Taiwan, and another interview with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Loading Both stories were longer than most standard news segments and, apart from covering a shark attack on the far north coast of NSW, the show steered clear of the kind of local fracas that are grist to the daily news mill. It\u2019s an approach, says Hitchcock, that melds the best of Australia\u2019s big TV news hitters: 7.30 and Four Corners on the ABC, 60 Minutes on Nine and Spotlight on Seven. \u201cOur show is a hybrid of almost all of them,\u201d says Hitchcock. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a story in our first two days, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be Monday [the Voulgaris story], that will be a story that 60 Minutes, Spotlight or Four Corners would kill for. So we\u2019re hoping viewers will come to us because they\u2019ll get the news of the day, they\u2019ll get the things that matter, but they\u2019ll also see something fresh.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrace, 37, and Hitchcock, 48, come to 10 News+ as familiar faces from Seven and Nine, respectively, where they built their reputations as foreign correspondents, with stints in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. They both began their careers at Seven \u2013 Brace in regional Queensland and Hitchcock in Sydney. Brace remembers her first day on the job at Seven, when she was a university student on a competitive internship, which involved covering a fatal bus crash. \u201cI went out shadowing a reporter,\u201d she says. \u201cI kind of really got thrown in the thick of it.\u201d It\u2019s been a wild ride since then, with Brace covering everything from the drought in rural Queensland to being part of a world-record skydive live on air (\u201cIt was absolutely terrifying. I cried in my goggles\u201d). In 2020, she won a Walkley Award for her coverage of the protests outside the White House, where she was hit with a baton by police. \u201cYou can\u2019t cover these things from a bureau or even from a block back,\u201d says Brace. \u201cBecause what is happening to these people is happening on the front line, and you have to be standing there, and you have to sit with your own eyes so you can actually stand up on camera or in Congress, as I had to, and say what happened wasn\u2019t right. Sometimes it\u2019s your job to say, \u2018I saw that and that wasn\u2019t OK.\u2019\u201d Hitchcock, meanwhile, got his start in the office of the now defunct current affairs show Today Tonight when he was 18 years old. \u201cI was answering the phones and filling the biscuit barrel,\u201d he says. \u201cBut within six months, I was a researcher, and within another three months after that, I was a producer at 18. It was fast, but from there I\u2019ve done almost every job \u2013 researcher, producer, editor, reporter, correspondent, all sorts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Brace, he\u2019s has the kind of globe-trotting news career that makes great TV \u2013 reporting from the frontlines of Syria and Iraq, covering the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines \u2013 but it\u2019s the quieter story of Sharn McNeill, who was only 30 when she was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, that he names as one of his favourites. \u201cIt always makes me teary whenever I even describe it to anybody,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those stories of human endurance and positivity that always stays with me.\u201d The team from 10 News+ (from left) 10 NEWS+ Samantha Butler, Brianna Parkins, Angela Bishop, Hugh Riminton, Amelia Brace, Denham Hitchcock, Ursula Heger, Ashleigh Raper, Bill Hogan and Carrie-Anne Greenbank. With so long in business, do either of them see a difference in how news is reported or consumed today? Loading \u201cI don\u2019t see a change in the stories of people interested in, just in the way they consume it and the speed in which they consume it,\u201d says Hitchcock. \u201cThose big stories used to happen and [you] used to be able to chew on it for a whole week. Now it could be the most immense story that you\u2019ve ever seen, and three days later, we\u2019re on to something else.\u201d Brace, meanwhile, thinks people are more overwhelmed than ever before by the \u201csheer amount of information out there\u201d and this is what leads to the rise in misinformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just selective reporting when you blatantly just tell one side of a story,\u201d says Brace. \u201cThat side is not untrue, but it\u2019s dangerous to do that, I think. I bump into people in real life regularly who say, \u2018Did you hear this?\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018But did you hear this?\u2019 And it\u2019s not that I\u2019m on one side or the other. I just get really annoyed when they have no idea that that\u2019s only half the story.\u201d Amelia Brace and Denham Hitchock interview Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the first episode of 10 News+ on Monday night. The US, famously, is home to Fox News, which proudly wears its bias on its sleeve. Do either of them think there is that type of biased reporting in Australia? \u201cWe have more of it than we used to,\u201d says Brace. \u201cI genuinely think that perhaps 10 years ago, we had a really balanced media with very little tolerance for bias. I remember maybe around the Kevin Rudd kind of time \u2013 because I\u2019m very politically focused \u2013 there started to be some headlines and some things said, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Hm, that\u2019s interesting reporting.\u2019 I just feel like it\u2019s grown over the years, where we now have certain outlets that you just know they\u2019re one side or the other. And I really don\u2019t like that.\u201d Loading Of course, it\u2019s not just bias or misinformation that modern broadcast news has to deal with. The fickle beast that is ratings will probably have more of an effect on 10 News+\u2019s future than any story they choose to do. A dramatic drop in ratings was one of the reasons given for The Project\u2019s axing, so what happens when, say, four weeks from now, 10 News+ isn\u2019t clicking and it\u2019s suggested they start chasing more sensational local stories? \u201cIt\u2019ll be a collective decision, the stories that we chase for the day,\u201d says Hitchock. \u201cSo that\u2019ll be Dan Sutton, who\u2019s the executive producer, and Martin White, who\u2019s the vice president [of news on Ten]. Those two will be keeping a keen eye on the show, and then Amelia and I, of course, will have heavy input as well.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "With ministerial consent to the title transfer under its belt through Half Moon, Marmota now owns 90 per cent of any minerals found at Golden Moon, including gold. The deal excludes opals, iron ore and palygorskite, which is also known as Fuller\u2019s Earth.\n\nUnder the joint venture terms, Half Moon will free carry Coombedown until a decision to mine is made. Marmota will manage the joint venture through Half Moon.\n\nUnlike the extensively drilled Aurora deposit, the Golden Moon ground has been subject to only minimal drilling. It had not been tested for six years until Marmota kicked off its sub-surface probing at Campfire Bore in September last year.\n\nMarmota Limited chairman Dr Colin Rose said: \u201cWe are delighted that the title transfers of these core gold deposits/tenements have now been formally completed, ticking off another box on Marmota\u2019s Gawler gold project. The Golden Moon JV heralds a new era of gold exploration and resource growth in the Gawler Craton. Work started on these assets under the guidance of Dominion, which made the discovery of the Challenger gold mine.\u201d\n\nDr Rose said the Golden Moon joint venture has cleared the deck, after some delays, with a clean new structure now completed.\n\nMarmota\u2019s first drilling program at Campfire Bore put in 86 reverse circulation holes for 11,690m by mid-October last year. The company immediately began planning follow-up work after seeing considerable growth potential at the prospect, encouraged by the December discovery of high-grade gold in multiple holes.\n\nCampfire Bore\u2019s best results from its first phase of drilling included an early 4m assaying 16 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 56m below surface and 16m going 2.7g/t gold from 35m, including 4m running 8.6g/t gold from 42m.\n\nOther results include bonanza grades up to 1m assaying 107g/t gold from 57m depth, five other intersections above 20g/t gold and 13 new intersections exceeding 10 g/t gold, including 5m going 12g/t, 3m at 11g/t and 3m at 10g/t gold.\n\nDuring an internal review of Greenewood\u2019s exploration history, Marmota noted previous third-party drilling results from 2016 and 2017 that include multiple intersections of more than 20g/t gold in six holes close to surface. These include 1m at 53g/t gold from 30m, 1m at 37g/t gold from 48m and 1m at 29g/t from 31m.\n\nA further three holes delivered 1m assaying 23g/t from 24m, 1m at 23g/t from 23m and 1m going 21g/t from 41m.\n\nThe proximity of the Golden Moon joint venture deposits to the company\u2019s Aurora Tank project brings development and logistical synergies and benefits.\n\nAurora Tank is characterised by multiple shallow high-grade hits and exhibits outstanding potential for low-cost, low-capex, open-pit, heap-leach production.\n\nWhile recent drilling has yielded a host of high-grade gold intersections and indicates significant potential for expansion, Marmota is focusing on completing its metallurgical test work and a scoping study and producing a maiden resource in the next six months.\n\nWith promising new ground close to Aurora Tank, the company now has a solid portfolio of gold deposits in the Gawler Craton to follow up.\n\nIt has already identified new high-grade gold extensions in first stage drilling at Campfire Bore. Through Half Moon, Marmota also owns all the Typhoon and Monsoon deposits, which are part of the Western Gawler Craton joint venture project.\n\nIf Marmota\u2019s imminent drilling at Greenewood can replicate its Aurora Tank and Campfire Bore successes, the company will have won a uniqiue trifecta \u2013 or something like this\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

        "text": "Residents argue an application to council to remove two towering trees could change the face of their suburb.\n\nAn Australian council has received an application to removed two \u201csignificant\u201d trees growing beside a derelict house. Source: Supplied\n\nTowering above a graffiti-covered timber fence and a grim, boarded-up house is a natural \u201clandmark\u201d a small Aussie community doesn\u2019t want to lose. They\u2019re determined to fight a plan to axe two towering eucalyptus trees that can be seen from almost anywhere in the increasingly urbanised Melbourne suburb of Thornbury.\n\nLocal woman Rebecca Hart has been working to save the twin sugar gums, which are estimated to have grown on the corner block for over a century. \u201cThey\u2019re majestic. Looking at them takes you somewhere else. These landmarks have stood tall regardless of all the development that\u2019s happened here,\u201d she told Yahoo News.\n\nTrees of this size are increasingly rare in Australia. And Hart is concerned that approval to axe these two giants could create a precedent which could result in her suburb becoming increasingly denuded of nature.\n\nLooking generally at large tree removal in urban centres, public safety is often a concern, with councils fearing they\u2019ll drop branches on cars or pedestrians. Other times, it\u2019s the residents themselves who want the trees gone \u2013 across Sydney\u2019s extravagant waterfront suburbs, there\u2019s a problem with people illegally poisoning them to reap the benefits of an improved view of the ocean.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut in the case of the Thornbury trees, it\u2019s a development plan that's putting the trees' future in doubt. Darebin Council confirmed with Yahoo that it has \u201crecently\u201d received an application to remove them and that it's aware of \u201csignificant community interest\u201d in the trees.\n\nRelated: \ud83c\udf33 Toorak resident's $100k tree complaint to council\n\nThe massive trees are filled with small hollows and provide habitat for native animals and birds. Source: Supplied\n\nThe home has sat derelict for years, so it's understandable that its recent sale has resulted in a plan to revamp the site. Anyone wishing to live there could argue they're concerned about the size of the trees on such a small block. Eucalyptus trees are known to drop branches, and living underneath them can be scary when they sway in the wind.\n\nCouncil maintains large trees only removed as 'last resort'\n\nIn an email, council CEO, Michael Tudball, said the full assessment process required to determine the future of the trees is not yet complete, and decisions normally take eight to 12 weeks. \u201cWe want to emphasise that removal of significant trees is only ever granted as a last resort where other mitigations aren\u2019t possible,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHart would like to see her council introduce a register of significant trees, as was proposed back in 2013. However council maintains one isn\u2019t needed because local laws give trees added protection when they are over 8 metres high and have a circumference of more than 100cm at 1.4 metres above the ground.\n\nThe two tree trunks have a diameter of approximately 3.7 metres and 3.9 metres at their base and reach higher than 8 metres, meaning they qualify under local laws as significant trees, but this doesn\u2019t ensure they will be spared. Looking generally at council guidelines, a case can be made to remove significant trees if they pose an immediate danger to people or property, and there\u2019s a replacement landscaping proposal that\u2019s deemed acceptable.\n\nTrees provide rare shelter for suburb's native animals\n\nHart says the removal of the trees would not only alter the face of her suburb, local wildlife will be robbed of somewhere to live.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Melbourne, hollow-bearing trees are a rarity, and that\u2019s led to localised extinctions of species you regularly see in other cities like the kookaburra.\n\nThe Thurnbury trees are known to have several hollows, and their branches provide shelter for native birds and mammals including ring-tail possums, wood ducks, lorikeets, magpies, butcherbirds, and bees.\n\n\u201cIn Thornbury, if you\u2019re looking west they are the most significant part of the skyline,\u201d Hart said. \u201cLast night, the trees were silhouetted with a crescent moon behind them. They\u2019re the biggest, most beautiful thing you can see.\u201d\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
