        "text": "Australia is in its fitness era, where marathon tickets are selling out just as fast as tickets to see the best global artists.\n\nYou only have to open social media or do a quick internet search to find an online fitness program to follow, which can claim to build a butt or be perfect for building abs.\n\nBut to look past this marketing terminology and find a program which best suits your health and fitness goals can be a daunting and challenging task.\n\nTwo industry professionals, with years of personal training experience, offered tips on what to look out for when choosing to spend money on an online program.\n\nCheck for relevant qualifications\n\nThe number one tip from both qualified personal trainers, Katie Martin and Tom Rock, was to check that the person who has written the program has relevant qualifications.\n\nMs Martin, who has been working in the industry for 10 years, said people with large followings who look a certain way were often branded as \"trainers\" but did not have qualifications.\n\nQualified personal trainer Katie Martin says it's important the author of the programs have relevant qualifications. (Supplied: Katie Martin)\n\n\"The industry \u2014 and social media in particular \u2014 is flooded with fitness influences that aren't necessarily qualified trainers \u2026 but to the average consumer, it can be quite confusing as to who is qualified and who is not,\" Ms Martin said.\n\n\"Just because they have a greater following doesn't necessarily mean that they're any more qualified than someone that actually is.\n\n\"I think it's very important to one, check that the person or the business designing the program is qualified and does have certifications in whatever area they are claiming to sell the program for.\"\n\nInvest in a personal trainer to do a few sessions prior to beginning a new program\n\nWhen starting an online fitness program, particularly one that involves lifting weights, it's important you know the correct technique to avoid injury.\n\nMany programs assume people have a base level of knowledge.\n\nBut for those who have little to no experience in strength training, Australian Fitness Academy course developer Tom Rock said doing some face-to-face sessions with a personal trainer first would be beneficial.\n\nTom Rock recommends a few face-to-face sessions with a personal trainer before starting an online fitness program. (Supplied: Tom Rock)\n\n\"[If] you haven't learned face to face how to do exercises properly, how to manage training load, or how to monitor how hard you're working and what it should feel like, you're not going to get a lot of out of these online programs,\" Mr Rock said.\n\n\"Investing in a face-to-face personal trainer for whether it's three, six or 12, months will be the best investment you make.\n\n\"I think people would find they get a lot more out of online programs, and probably have a better idea of what they should look for.\"\n\nMs Martin said while it's an up-front cost, it will help in the long run.\n\n\"I think that small investment is going to deter you from having to spend money or time at the physio or a doctor in case you injure yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"Just getting two to three sessions under your belt, learning how to lift properly, how to lift safely, is going to benefit you in the long run, tenfold.\"\n\nWatch out for unrealistic marketing tactics\n\nIt's not uncommon to see exercise programs which promote weight loss in a certain period of time, like 'lose 10 kilograms in just two weeks'.\n\nMs Martin said that kind of language can be harmful and create unrealistic expectations.\n\n\"I think where the fitness industry really goes wrong is that they're taking advantage of people that are in really vulnerable positions,\" she said.\n\n\"They're taking advantage of people that are trying to do the right thing by their health, that are trying to make the right change, and they use a varying range of marketing techniques to try and do that.\"\n\nShe said everyone's health journey was unique.\n\n\"What the program should be trying to promote is that it will potentially make someone stronger or cardiovascular fitter but not trying to tell someone how many kilos they're going to lose,\" Ms Martin said.\n\n\"It is so ambiguous, because it also very much comes down to what their diet looks like and all their other lifestyle choices.\n\n\"It's almost a lie, and it's really sad, because yet we see very vulnerable people that are truly trying to do the right thing by themselves, and their bodies fall into these traps just because they are so desperate to see change.\"\n\nWhat about running programs?\n\nFrom the original couch to five kilometres to more advanced marathon programs, running programs have been around a while.\n\nMr Rock said running is more a straightforward concept, which makes it easier to follow a general program.\n\n\"I think probably running programs have a better scope just to be applied generically in an online program, it's a little bit less complicated, I would say, than learning to resistance train,\" he said.\n\n\"There's not a massive learning curve.\"\n\nFollowing an online running program is more straightforward, but make sure to continue strength exercises. (Unsplash: Andrew Tanglao)\n\nWhile for the most part, everybody knows how to run, Ms Martin said its important to maintain strength training to help prevent injuries.\n\n\"The only risk you run, no pun intended, is that with most running programs, there is no supplementary strength program to support people's running goals,\" she said.\n\n\"If you are not a particularly consistent runner, or it's not something you've done, you do run the risk of going from zero to 100 and injuring yourself.\n\n\"A well written program shouldn't take you from zero to 100 and again, that's why it's important to look into where you're getting your programs from.\"",

Destination: unknown.\n\nThe opposition leader this morning is offering tax incentives to help give new small businesses a boost.\n\nHe's set a target, too \u2014 to have 350,000 new small businesses open in the first four years of a Dutton government.\n\nUnder the proposed \"entrepreneurship accelerator\" scheme, businesses would only have to pay tax on a portion of their income.\n\nIn the first year, businesses would pay tax on 25 per cent of the first $100,000 earned. They would then be taxed on half of the second $100,000 earned.\n\nThe accelerator scheme would taper off in years two and three.\n\nEligibility criteria include having an aggregated turnover of less than $10 million, and having no more than 20 shareholders (and property developers are specifically excluded).\n\nThe Liberals are also offering a tax deduction on tech upgrades to small businesses as part of their overall package.\n\nYou can get up to speed on all the details with the story below.",

(ABC News: Tim Swanston)\n\nMeanwhile, the closure of a nearby supermarket has changed foot traffic along the main thoroughfare in the area where he trades.\n\nWhile Mr Booth-Remmers says the public's appetite for high-end chocolates shows no sign of waning, ongoing cost of living pressures have prompted some of his customers to spend less in his cafe.\n\n\"Probably in the last nine months or so we've really felt it,\" he says.\n\n\"[People] might come in for their daily coffee still, but leave off the extra treat on the side.\"\n\nMarcus Booth-Remmers says customers are spending less money at his Red Cacao cafe in Stirling.

Former Sydney player Fiona Worts struck twice after Madeleine Caspers had opened the scoring for the visitors.\n\nMelbourne has gone unbeaten both at home and in the Asian Champions League since their grand final defeat to Sydney, a 27-match run.\n\n\"Words can't describe the feelings that are going through my body at the moment, I am super proud,\" said City coach Michael Matricciani, who took over at the start of the season when Dario Vidosic left for English club Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\n\"One trophy down, to go undefeated \u2014 I couldn't ever imagine that,\" added Matricciani to Paramount+. \"It is a true testament to the determination, focus and quality of these girls.

        "text": "When Chris was growing up, the recipe for success seemed simple: work hard, get a good job, then live a good life.\n\nNow in his 30s, he feels like that formula no longer applies.\n\n\"The returns I'm getting for my effort are so disproportionate with respect to what you would expect to get in previous generations,\" he said.\n\nChris's efforts include multiple degrees and a PhD, much of which he completed while working full-time. He now has a well-paid job as a scientist. Despite all that, he thinks his goal of owning a standalone house in his hometown, Sydney, is out of reach.\n\nHis 30s have been a stark contrast to his father's, who by Chris's age \u2014 with just a year 10 certificate under his belt \u2014 owned a three-bedroom house and supported a family with two kids on a single income.\n\n\"These days, even if both people who are partners work hard, or someone who's single works very hard, they're never going to achieve what previous generations achieved,\" he said.\n\nMany voters under 40 have written to the ABC with a similar story to Chris: they feel like they did everything \"right\" but will never achieve what their parents or grandparents did.\n\nIt's also a story that has defined the past week of the election campaign.\n\nBoth Labor and the Coalition have unveiled a suite of policies designed to make it easier for people to buy their first homes. Political pundits said these measures targeted younger voters, many of whom rent and fear they will forever.\n\nWorrying about buying property isn't exclusive to young people, and many people from older generations have written to the ABC with their concerns too.\n\nBut it's gen Zs and millennials who will outnumber boomers for the first time this election \u2014 and it's their vote politicians are desperately trying to court.\n\nLoading...\n\nWorked hard but 'it doesn't matter'\n\nThe ABC's YourSay project has received more than 4,600 submissions from people concerned about housing affordability, including younger voters who worry they will never own their own home.\n\nOne of those is Emily, a 37-year-old who lives on the Gold Coast with her three-year-old son. We are using a pseudonym because she works for the government.\n\nEmily grew up, in her words, very poor. She was determined to one day build a different life.\n\n\"I just didn't want to live like that,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure that \u2026 if I had children, I would always be able to have a roof over their head, and that there would always be food.\"\n\nPart of her future plans included owning her own home for stability. After working hard in school and going to university, she ended up earning more than $100,000 a year, and also managed to put away almost $100,000 in savings.\n\nBy the time she was ready to buy, Gold Coast property prices had climbed so high that suitable homes to raise her son in were unaffordable.\n\n\"It really does seem like [my hard work] just doesn't matter, and the defining feature is just that I tried but I got in too late,\" she said.\n\nLoading\n\nThe feeling that hard work isn't enough anymore is one researchers who talk to young people hear often. Kos Samaras, a director at the political strategy group Redbridge, said intergenerational inequality was a common theme in the focus groups he conducts.\n\n\"When we talk to young Australians, the first thing they will tell us is how they think the system is stacked against them, how they will clearly live a life that is of a lesser quality than their parents and grandparents, and how the social contract they thought existed is broken,\" he said.\n\n\"They were basically told all their lives that if they study hard, get the marks they need, get a good job \u2026 that should set them up for life. That's clearly not the case.\n\n\"[They think]: 'I've done everything they told me to do and I'm still screwed.'\"\n\nYoung people who feel 'cheated' gravitating to minor parties\n\nUnhappiness about the housing divide may appear to have bubbled over this week, but experts say it's been brewing for years. Julia Cook, a youth sociologist from the University of Newcastle, saw it in her research as far back as 2017.\n\n\"I was reading the surveys from participants who were in their early 30s, and \u2026 it was all [about] housing affordability,\" she said.\n\n\"It was, 'I have managed to get into the property market, but I could only do it with help from my parents', or, 'I don't think I'm ever going to be able to afford a house, and I'm so disappointed, and I feel cheated'.\"\n\nToday's 30 to 34-year-olds are the first in nearly 50 years where most people don't own a house, data from AIHW shows. It's a shift that's affecting young people emotionally as well as economically, said Rachel ViforJ, a housing inequity researcher from Curtin University.\n\n\"I think being able to achieve home ownership has always been like a bit of a marker \u2026 that you're an independent adult who's able to own an asset and own your own home,\" Dr ViforJ said.\n\n\"But you take that away from a person, and it can actually have quite a detrimental impact on how they view themselves and their future.\"\n\nThat sense of hopelessness about the future is something that has come up in Mr Samaras's work too. He says many gen Zs and millennials no longer feel like politics is \"in the business of solving their problems\".\n\n\"One thing we know about young Australians: if they've got a history of voting for a major party, and they choose to no longer support that major party, they don't go over to the other major party,\" he said.\n\n\"They go and vote for minor parties. That's the trend we're seeing.\"\n\nMajor parties pulling out all the stops to win over aspiring home owners\n\nHow much will this hopelessness and dissatisfaction about intergenerational inequality affect the election's outcome? Experts say it's difficult to predict \u2014 but it's something the major parties are keenly aware of.\n\nLast week both the prime minister and the opposition leader hit the campaign trail, spruiking their visions for how they would make first-home ownership more available to young people.\n\nMr Dutton even enlisted his son in the campaign, to talk about his own struggles saving for a house deposit as a young person.\n\nAfter feeling overlooked in previous elections, younger people might appreciate feeling \"heard\" after these housing announcements, Dr Cook said.\n\n\"Whether they are actually good policies is a different question, but I think they are likely to be appealing to younger voters simply because they signal that their challenges are understood and are being taken seriously,\" she said.\n\nThe policies may not have had the impact among younger voters that the major parties had hoped for, however.\n\nMr Samsaras said Mr Dutton's son sharing his story, rather than resonating with younger voters, might have made them confused.\n\n\"One person [in a focus group] said \u2026 '[Peter Dutton's] got millions of dollars of shares, and he's got a property portfolio \u2014 can't he just help his kids out?'\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\nHousing promises 'the most profound' attempt to connect with young voters\n\nSome voters who wrote into the ABC said they were concerned Labor and the Coalition's promises would not make houses cheaper. Economists said their policies would actually make houses more expensive.\n\nBut that could be by design.\n\nDr ViforJ points out that despite the generational divide, most voters do own property. Younger home owners, who may have bought in recently at eye-watering prices, could have a lot to lose if property values started falling.\n\n\"You have a huge chunk of recent homebuyers who are really invested in the housing market because they've had to deal with higher house prices by borrowing a lot from the banks,\" she said.\n\n\"They can't actually afford to see house prices drop.\"\n\nWhat are your views on capping rent increases?

Follow the link to take the survey.\n\nWhile gen Z and millennial voters have overtaken boomers for the first time this election, their numbers are only going to grow.\n\nMr Samsaras says if Labor and the Coalition don't address their concerns, they could be in for a shock when the next election rolls around.\n\n\"They've taken some steps, and it's probably the most profound ones, where they are directly talking to this generation,\" he said.\n\n\"Now that conversation needs to continue, because if it doesn't \u2026 2028 could be a lot more problematic.\"\n\nThis story is part of the Your Say: Housing special.

        "text": "Over the last three decades, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have quietly but steadily climbed in Australia, with bacterial diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis spreading across the country.\n\nIn 2004, just over 35,724 new cases of chlamydia were recorded in Australia, according to federal government data. By 2024, that figure had roughly tripled to more than 102,000 notifications, with infections spread roughly evenly across men and women.\n\n\"When we look at these data, we can see that chlamydia continues to be the most frequently notified sexually transmissible infection,\" said Skye McGregor, an epidemiologist with UNSW's Kirby Institute, leading its Australian STI and bloodborne virus surveillance reporting.\n\nGonorrhoea and syphilis have followed a similar trajectory.\n\nAnnual confirmed cases of the former had risen from 7,047 in 2004 to more than 44,000 in 2024.\n\nSyphilis numbers climbed by almost ninefold to 5,969 over the same period.\n\nThe last three decades have seen persistent growth in sexually transmitted infections, including the bacterial disease syphilis. (Flickr: NIAID)\n\nWhile these infections can be treated with antibiotics and lack the harm potential of other sexual diseases like HIV, they present serious health consequences if they remain undetected, including infertility, congenital transmission and, in the case of syphilis, organ damage.\n\nThose first-line treatments are also at risk of soon becoming ineffective, with antimicrobial resistance an expanding global issue.\n\nLast year, NSW Health issued a public warning of how gonorrhoea cases resistant to azithromycin and ceftriaxone were growing in the state.\n\n\"It makes infections harder to treat, which increases the risk of transmission, illness and even death,\" Dr McGregor said.\n\nThough the rise of bacterial STIs is well-documented \u2014 long observed by health workers in the country and overseas \u2014 exactly why it's happening is something more complex and opaque.\n\n'We can't just point to one thing'\n\nWhile specific populations \u2014 including men who have sex with men (MSM) \u2014 have long been associated with higher risk, the current data indicates these diseases are proliferating across age, gender and sexuality demographics.\n\n\"There's a range of factors. We can't just point to one thing and go, 'This is the main reason we're seeing an increase in STIs',\" Dr McGregor said.\n\nOne suspected reason for an increase in cases is a decline in safe sex, a trend partially influenced by medical innovation. (ABC News: James Hancock)\n\nIncluded in that range of factors are the asymptomatic nature of these bacterial diseases, declining condom use and the unintended impacts of medical innovation.\n\nResearch has found the widespread availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that prevents HIV infection, has contributed to more unprotected sex.\n\nThe most immediate solution to all of this is also the most basic: Safer sexual practices alongside regular, proactive sexual health screenings.\n\n\"It's really important to have the message of regular, comprehensive testing,\" Dr McGregor said.\n\nBut despite that message's simplicity, enacting that change is difficult.\n\nOne explanation held by Dr McGregor is the lack of awareness of diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis alongside infection risk factors.\n\nSkye McGregor said prevention campaigns, at the scale of those targeting HIV and Hepatitis C, could raise awareness. (ABC News: Andrew Whitington)\n\nThis blind spot, she said, stems in part from years of underinvestment, with few public health campaigns and research efforts matching the scale of those targeting HIV or Hepatitis C \u2014 diseases where infection rates have dropped in recent years.\n\n\"It's complex, but if you take into account where the reductions have been, there's a reason for it.\"\n\nStigma, healthcare costs fuelling screening avoidance\n\nWhile greater investment in prevention initiatives could raise the necessary awareness, other experts say strategies targeting the full spectrum of those at risk are as crucial.\n\n\"Traditionally we focused on what we call high-risk populations: MSM and Indigenous and so on. But maybe that's not the only group that needs all these resources poured into,\" Melbourne Sexual Health Centre's Jason Ong said.\n\nIt's something the sexual health physician and researcher has observed firsthand. In recent years, the number of people seeking screenings has increased. Yet, infection numbers are still continuing to rise.\n\n\"If you're testing more people, why aren't the STI rates dropping? And so that's also part of that story where, maybe, we're not testing the right populations,\" he said.\n\n\"Within certain groups, we know definitely there are people that are not testing.\"\n\nThe lack of testing may come down to awareness, but it could also be deliberate avoidance. It's long been established how the stigma surrounding STIs can dissuade someone from seeking medical care.\n\nOne reason why people aren't receiving sexual health screenings is due to perceived stigma. (Pixabay)\n\nIn 2021, Professor Ong co-authored a meta-analysis on what encourages young people from high-income countries to seek STI testing. Both limited awareness and stigma were named as key deterrents.\n\n\"If we can address that stigma piece, I think that will help a lot so that people can feel comfortable to talk to a doctor about it \u2014 and get the proper testing and treatments if needed.\"\n\nBut stigma isn't the only barrier to receiving sexual healthcare. The decline of bulk-billing practices within a cost-of-living crisis is keeping people away, too.\n\n\"It's now expensive for people to go to the GP,\" said David Lewis, the conjoint professor of the University of Sydney's Sydney Medical School and a sexual health physician in the city's western suburbs.\n\n\"You can do health promotion, but if you don't make the testing easily accessible for people, then it's a challenge.\"\n\n'These interventions need to be tailored'\n\nOne workaround could be importing the strategies embraced for other sexual diseases.\n\nAt-home rapid tests for HIV have been available in Australia since 2019, with a pilot program providing free access in NSW launched last year.\n\nWhile self-test kits for chlamydia and gonorrhoea were approved for Australian use in November, a similar initiative doesn't exist. But this model of private and instant care could be a blueprint for increasing screening rates.\n\n\"There's all these other bits of the puzzle. It's not just a question of promotion and education.\" Professor Lewis said.\n\n\"It's very hard to shift sexual risk. What programs are successful in doing is often changing health-seeking behaviour,\" said Burnet Institute's head of public health Mark Stoov\u00e9.\n\nA 'morning after' pill for STIs Photo shows A blister pack of the antibiotic doxycycline, which is used to treat a range of conditions from acne to cholera. Australia's leading sexual health experts say taking an antibiotic after unprotected sex could help curb rising rates of syphilis in the community, but there's a big catch.\n\nThis use of new approaches that centre availability, accessibility and less visibility could be one way forward to circumnavigate those hurdles to testing and sexual healthcare.\n\nPointing to the introduction of point-of-care testing and telehealth in response to HIV and Hepatitis C, Professor Stoov\u00e9 said similar adaptive models of care would \u2014 when combined with targeted education and public health messaging \u2014 close gaps in testing, in turn lowering infection rates.\n\nAny response, he added, needs to be tailored to meet the needs of wherever people are \u2014 whether that be financially, culturally, socially or geographically.\n\n\"Particularly in the space of sexual health education, if we're putting a campaign out there, people need to recognise that the campaign is speaking to them.\"",

        "text": "Cameron Green has marked his comeback from surgery by hitting a century for English county Gloucestershire, but then retired hurt suffering from cramp.\n\nGreen left the field on Friday at Canterbury as soon as he completed his 171-ball ton. Having reached his century with a quick single to mid-on both umpire and batting partner stretched out his legs (still with pads on) before he departed.\n\nThe issue was unsurprising given this was his first match since suffering soreness after playing an ODI in England in September. A month later he underwent back surgery after scans revealed a stress fracture, his fifth.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nGreen confirmed afterwards that he would be OK to continue his innings on day two, after \"a good night's sleep and a bit of food\".\n\n\"One hundred per cent I'm proud,\" he said of becoming the 10th player to score a first-class hundred on debut for Gloucestershire. \"It's been eight long months on the sidelines so to get back out here was very special and it's always a good way to start your tenure.\"\n\nGreen has joined Gloucestershire for five four-day red-ball matches, concluding in late May, as he builds his match fitness with a view to playing for Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord's in June.\n\nThe Australian came to the crease with his new county, who play in the second division, reeling at 3-41 against Kent.\n\nCompatriot and county captain Cameron Bancroft, opening the batting, was one of the departed, leg before for two.\n\nGreen added 67 with Miles Hammond at four-an-over, before coming together with former England cap James Bracey. The pair, scoring at a similar rate, put on 167 before Green's exit after a little more than four hours batting.\n\nBracey went on to complete his own century, ending 109 not out at stumps as Glos closed on 7-365, Nathan Gilchrist taking 5-61.\n\nKent had been hampered by losing West Australian-born Italy international opening bowler Grant Stewart who pulled up having bowled 6.3 overs.\n\nAAP",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Football coaches tend to fit the three categories former British Labour Cabinet Minister, Tony Benn, once ascribed to politicians: straight guys, fixers and maddies. Benn did not live to see the presidency of Donald Trump, who is a mix - a maddie who thinks he is a fixer. Similarly, most NRL coaches like to see themselves as straight guys, but the long-term ones, with nurtured media and headquarters contacts, can become adroit fixers. Souths coach Wayne Bennett is described by John Ribot, his former boss at the Broncos, as \u201cthe best politician in Australia\u201d. North Queensland Cowboys coach, Todd Payten, is a 180-degree straight guy. One incident defines him as the opposite of the fixer. It was a 2020 interview on Fox Sports where he revealed he had been offered the position as head coach of the Warriors but rejected it, hoping to secure a job back in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsofar as Payten was then an assistant to Steve Kearney, who had just been sacked, and it was only June, and he had already been appointed interim first grade coach, it intrigued coach watchers. Most coaches would have obfuscated, uttered ultimately meaningless commitments to the players, the club and the board. In other words, acted like a politician. It was the middle of the COVID bubble, and Payten now reveals what really happened. \u201cI did a pre-record for 360 with Ikin and Kent, about 15 minutes before it went to air. They asked me what I could bring to the Warriors and I spoke bullshit,\u201d Payten said. Todd Payten speaking to media in 2020 as interim Warriors coach. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThe interview didn\u2019t sit well with me. I thought, \u2018Shit, I\u2019ve straight out lied.\u2019 I had a sick feeling in the gut. So I called them back and did the interview live, telling the truth. I had rejected the Warriors job and I didn\u2019t have things sorted at home in Australia. I had been promised an interview for the Cowboys top job, but it was just an interview. \u201d Three months later Payten was announced as the Cowboys head coach on a three-year deal, beginning 2021. So, he was back in Townsville where he had joined the late Paul Green as an assistant in 2015, after three years on the coaching staff at Wests Tigers where he played 151 top-grade games, including the 2005 grand final win over the Cowboys. The evidence of his career as a straight guy in Townsville indicates he has, as he says, \u201cripped the band-aid off and told the truth to the players.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe stripped Jason Taumalolo of the captaincy shortly after the big lock had been given a 10-year contract and also benched him. He released Valentine Holmes, Chad Townsend and 2015 grand final hero Kyle Feldt at the end of last season and dropped Queensland Origin player Jeremiah Nanai after one game this year. Asked if he sees himself as a straight guy, Payten says, \u201cI\u2019m pretty much straight down the line. I like to keep it honest, keep the feedback continuous. I like to be open, truthful. But I try to massage the message and I haven\u2019t always got it right.\u201d He doesn\u2019t blow smoke up a talented player\u2019s tailpipe, nor play on a footballer\u2019s insecurity like a fiddle. Nor is he a caffeinated coach, of the maddie type. Jason Taumalolo of the Cowboys runs the ball. Credit: Getty Images Following a round five win over the Panthers, he told a press conference, \u201cI mightn\u2019t seem it, but I am ecstatic.\u201d He told me, \u201cI like to remain calm and level-headed. I\u2019m not overly emotional. I wouldn\u2019t like my personality to contribute to a loss, and I\u2019m aware that my energy in the dressing room is contagious, meaning the players can take it aboard, so I try to keep it steady.\u201d Again, he makes the confession: \u201cSometimes I haven\u2019t got it right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe perception of Payten as a straight guy is at odds with a burr from his past. A rumour has circulated for over a decade that he undermined head coach Michael Potter at Wests Tigers when he was an assistant. Mick Potter talking with Benji Marshall at the Wests Tigers in 2013. Credit: Brendan Esposito Unfortunately for Payten, an unfounded rumour in rugby league is not one that is easily lost. It is not unusual in professional football clubs for an assistant to white ant the top guy but it was more common in rugby league\u2019s three-grade era, where lower grade coaches coveted the top job. \u201cIt is incorrect,\u201d Payten says, admitting the Potter story has plagued him his entire career. \u201cIt is absolute bullshit. My reputation took a hit. That part of my life is over. I haven\u2019t said anything publicly previously, and I\u2019ve got no further comment.\u201d Potter described Wests Tigers at the time as \u201ca political hotbed.\u201d Because Payten switched straight from playing at Wests Tigers to an assistant coach\u2019s role, he became inextricably linked with the dissension of senior players disenchanted with Potter.

We all bunkered down in our bubble and tried to look after each other.\u201d One question many NRL head coaches refuse to answer on the record for fear of upsetting the administration is whether the skill level of players has deteriorated. The NRL has spent record sums on development, but some coaches concede the skill of the new ones joining a club\u2019s top roster of 30 is not as proficient as those a decade ago. Payten is in an ideal situation to answer in that he joined the Cowboys as an assistant in 2015. \u201cWe won the comp ten years ago,\u201d he says with a rare chuckle, meaning a comparison with his current squad is unfair. Defence doesn\u2019t get taught well enough below NRL level Todd Payten While he lauds the stellar passing skills of those now coming to the top grade, he points out attack is only one half of the game. \u201cDefence doesn\u2019t get taught well enough below NRL level,\u201d he says. \u201cHow to move, step into the contest, fullbacks getting the numbers right from the back.

        "text": "Australian women are greater users of GP appointments than men. This trend is starker for longer appointments \u2013 women attended 59 per cent of short consults, according to Medicare data from 2023-2024, but 63 per cent of consults lasting at least 40 or 45 minutes. Loading Sylvia Freedman, the co-founder of endometriosis charity Endo Active, said longer appointments were essential for people with complex health conditions. \u201cConditions like endo are whole-of-body conditions, which means you could have three, four or five various symptoms and things impacting your immune system that are seemingly unrelated but that are all part of the same picture. That\u2019s complex. That takes time. You might have to get four different referrals in that appointment,\u201d Freedman said. As the gap widens between Medicare rebates and the cost of delivering care, some GP clinics are requesting that patients only discuss one issue during a standard consultation.\n\n\u201cWe need to [redesign] the system \u2026 so that we can actually have the time to listen and to be curious,\u201d said experienced Melbourne GP Associate Professor Ines Rio. AMA president Danielle McMullen. The AMA wants an overhaul of the Medicare rebate structure so that a greater range of longer consultations is funded. The current rebate for an appointment that lasts six minutes is the same as a consult that lasts 19 minutes. AMA president Dr Danielle McMullen said Medicare was introduced 40 years ago when \u201cpeople went to the GP with one or two quite simple problems\u201d. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the situation where we\u2019ve got more chronic disease, an ageing population, more mental healthcare issues, and, in fact, even for really relatively simple problems, healthcare has gotten more complicated.\u201d\n\nThe RACGP is calling for a 40 per cent boost to rebates for consults over 20 and 40 minutes, estimating its plan will prevent about 4000 emergency department presentations and 11,000 hospitalisations annually. In February, the Albanese government pledged more than $573 million to new women\u2019s health initiatives, including cheaper contraceptives and new rebates for menopause assessments at the GP. The announcement was welcomed by health groups and matched by the Coalition. Medical misogyny has been a focus of Albanese\u2019s Assistant Health Minister, Ged Kearney, who in 2023 asked members of the National Women\u2019s Health Advisory Council to update the National Women\u2019s Health Strategy to tackle the phenomenon. The government also commissioned a gender review of Medicare items. \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to women and have delivered historic reforms,\u201d Kearney said. Shadow health spokesperson Anne Ruston said the women\u2019s stories uncovered by this masthead were \u201cextremely distressing\u201d.\n\nAs well as pledging to match Labor\u2019s women\u2019s health funding package, the Coalition has promised a review to address gaps in Medicare funding of women-specific items. In 2024, the average time GPs spent with patients was 18.7 minutes, according to RACGP data. However, female GPs, who were far more likely to be consulted on women\u2019s health and mental health issues, spent longer \u2013 an average of 20.2 minutes with their patients, compared to 16.7 minutes for male GPs. Dr Samantha Saling, a GP with a private-billing practice in east Sydney, said her standard appointment was 20 minutes. This would be considered a \u201clong\u201d consultation under the current Medicare system. \u201cMy new patients appointments are much longer. I find that this is the minimum amount of time it takes to hear a patient\u2019s story, work through the nitty-gritty issues, and often there are multiple things that are brought up in a consult,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say 80 per cent of your diagnosis is in your history and your history comes from conversation. You need that time to get to the core of what the patient\u2019s agenda is and what medical issues are causing that. And then, of course, your psychosocial issues and factors as well.\u201d\n\nDr Jillann Farmer, a former United Nations medical director and a rural GP with additional specialist training, said improved GP rebate funding alone would not solve \u201cmedical misogyny\u201d, which was pervasive. \u201cEveryone, not just doctors and not just men, is socialised to believe that women exaggerate, that they should not be believed, that they are manipulative, emotional, stupid or hormone-mad,\u201d she said. She agreed, though, that there was an enormous need to better fund doctors who treat patients with complex presentations, in women\u2019s health and across the board. \u201cSo a doctor who sees a 90-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, and gives him 45 minutes, because he needs it \u2013 that doctor deserves to be paid as much as the doctor who sees five patients in those 45 minutes \u2013 perhaps even more, because the GP who successfully manages complexity saves the healthcare system an enormous amount of money,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cWe also need to remember that there is a really terrible GP shortage, especially in the regions. Those GPs that we do have are working absolutely flat out \u2013 no longer having the luxury of appointments held for \u201curgent\u201d same day appointments\u2026 If it can help keep doctors in the workforce, then that would help.\u201d",

        "text": "Children with this little-known autistic neurotype are often labelled as badly behaved, and their parents' approach to raising them is often questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why the recognition of Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) in the Australian government's first national autism strategy as a profile of autism earlier this year has been welcomed by many parents and advocates for families of 'PDAers', as many refer to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristina Keeble is both of those.\n\n\n\nDysregulation\n\nKeeble worked as a teacher in specialist education settings for years before having her own children.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite her training and experience in supporting neurodivergent children, none of the conventional strategies seemed to work with hers; Keeble said they actually increased their dysregulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth are autistic and have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\n\nChristina Keeble had worked in specialist education settings for years, but the techniques she had been using to support neurodivergent children did not seem to work for her own kids. Source: Supplied / Jessica Roberts \"Their extreme dysregulation and meltdowns could manifest as crying, physical or verbal aggression, breaking their things, and at its worst, self-harm,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could last for hours with anything we tried to alleviate their pain or distress not working.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe describes her children as neurodivergent PDAers.\n\n\n\nExtreme demand avoidance\n\nChildren who fit the PDA profile may show what are often described as \"challenging behaviours\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term PDA was coined by British clinical psychologist Elizabeth Newson in the 1980s, and the PDA Society UK was established in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe society's website describes PDAers as people who share autistic characteristics but also have a need for control, \"which is often anxiety related\", and states for those with the PDA neurotype, \"demand avoidance is a question of can't not won't\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's national autism strategy recognises PDA as \"a profile or subtype of autism\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia, which was updated in 2023, described PDA as a set of characteristics that can co-occur with autism and is recognised as a behavioural profile within autism.\n\n\n\nRecognition of PDA\n\nPDA is not considered a standalone diagnosis like autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , but it sits under autism as a certain presentation shown by some people on the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not a diagnostic test, the extreme demand avoidance questionnaire exists to measure behaviours associated with the neurotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, some Australian health professionals, such as paediatricians, psychologists and speech therapists, have started mentioning the profile in reports and diagnosis documentation of those who they consider fit the profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, anecdotes about health professionals and educators telling parents PDA does not exist or is not recognised in Australia have been repeatedly shared in online support groups for those who fit the neurotype and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is likely why the simple mention of PDA in a blog on the National Disability Insurance Scheme website was shared to the 14,000 followers of the PDA Australia Facebook as \"breaking news\".\n\n\n\nAn Edith Cowan University (ECU) research study released this year on the experience of mothers of children with PDA noted: \"Parents spoke about their experience of interacting with professionals in education and health-care settings who had limited understanding about PDA, invariably leading to misguided advice, poor support, or harmful practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble said while it was \"clear from the research that is available that it is currently a profile, not a stand-alone diagnosis, some professionals choose to not acknowledge it because it is not in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or the ICD (International Classification of Diseases).\"\n\n\n\nLowering demands\n\nThose advocating for increased recognition of PDA believe that making a distinction between autism and those with the PDA profile of the condition is important because it requires a specific approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PDA Society UK describes PDAers as \"driven to avoid everyday demands and expectations [including things they want to do or enjoy] to an extreme extent\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile demands in the case of PDAers can be direct requests or questions from others, they can come in different forms. They can be things such as eating, sleeping, and showering, but PDA Society UK explains that indirect demands such as praise, expectations, or uncertainty have the potential to cause anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble said PDA required a different approach to traditional parenting, and not providing PDA informed support could result in harm or trauma being caused to a child.\n\n\n\nThe PDA Society UK encourages a \"proactive and collaborative approach\" to parenting to manage anxiety in PDA children, with a focus on \"picking their battles\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIts website advises: \"In place of firm boundaries and the use of rewards, consequences and praise, an approach based on negotiation, collaboration and flexibility tends to work better in PDA households.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome health practitioners have started to take an approach to those who fit the profile that reduces demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble said once she was able to let go of the notion that things had to be a certain way in her household and with her children, such as everyone must sit at the kitchen table for meals, the stress that had been a constant in her household started to reduce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, when they have capacity, they naturally participate more with the demands of daily life. For us, it was finding the natural rhythm of our family,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble is now one of Australia's most well-known voices on PDA and works as a neurodiversity educational consultant.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What these autistic people want you to call them\n\nA closer look at the DSM\n\nPDA is not mentioned in the DSM, the reference guide for health professionals diagnosing autism or the International Classification of Diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been a number of updated versions of the DSM, which have changed with new research and understanding; for example, homosexuality was listed as a diagnosable condition until 1973.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current version was published in 2013 and is based on research done between 2000 and 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Trembath, professor in speech pathology at Griffith University, said he expected a new edition of the DSM would likely be released in the next few years, as they were generally published every 10 to 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he said he doesn't think PDA would be included in an updated version \"given the lack of an extensive evidence base to support its existence as a separate and sufficiently distinct condition\".\n\n\n\nThe PDA label\n\nTrembath, who is also the co-chair of the group that developed the second edition of the national guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia, said the guidelines recognise \"PDA is a term used by some members of the community to help describe and explain some of the behaviours that are seen in autistic children and adults\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said practitioners should be considering all available information to develop a holistic understanding of the person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not so much about whether the term PDA should be used, and instead all about understanding them as an individual,\" Trembath said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The guideline recommends an individualised approach, irrespective of how a person's behaviour is described, so we would say that a 'different approach' is required for each person, irrespective of whether their behaviour is described in terms of PDA or other terms.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Autism Strategy, which was launched in Perth in January by Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth, recognises Pathological Demand Avoidance as a profile of autism. Source: AAP / Aaron Bunch Trembath said he was aware of some practitioners including mention of PDA in autism reports, but said from an anecdotal point of view: \"It is not a common way of talking about people's characteristics, strengths, and support needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who use the term say it helps to understand, talk about, and respond to the needs of the individual. Others will say it adds a layer of complexity, lacks an agreed definition and precision, and may be offensive to some people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble described Trembath's position as \"idealised\" and not informed by the lived experience of PDAers and their families.\n\n\n\nA push for more recognition\n\nThe recent ECU research produced what may be the first published research in Australia, giving insight into the experience of Australian families of autistic children with a PDA profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt highlighted the need for greater recognition, understanding and acceptance of the PDA profile and for flexible, informed and appropriate support for PDA children and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeble, who is taking part in the Inaugural PDA Conference Australia in Perth later in the year, wants more professionals who work with young children to acknowledge PDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Getting professionals to acknowledge the profile on reports and formal diagnoses letters gives parents the documentation which, they can use to advocate for their children our society requires,\" she said.\n\n\n\n",

I was especially fond of the black Easter egg \u2013 with its black background and flowers in red, pink, and purple \u2013 it really stood out. It was something special, truly special. Every Easter, I would get an egg from my godmother, and my mom would buy an even more beautiful one for her daughter than the one I received. Mine was, let\u2019s say, second or third tier. As a child, I used to resent that and would say: \u201cI\u2019ll make one myself \u2013 and much better! Of course, that was just a childish reaction; I didn\u2019t mean it seriously... but in the end, that\u2019s exactly how it turned out \u2013 because today, I genuinely love making them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBiserka now leads workshops across Croatia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt means young children, local women and tourists are all learning a skill that once filled every home in her village.\n\n\n\n\n\nLjudmila Suzdaljceva is a participant in a recent workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had never done it before, but I like it. It's very interesting, but also quite difficult. You really have to practise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Easter eggs once had deep meaning, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nPensioner Nada Simunic says they were once exchanged in friendship ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Easter eggs were always given as gifts. Best friends would come together and exchange Easter eggs. This tradition always took place on the Sunday after Easter. They would say, 'A sister, a bride is forever, a sister,' and that marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Vucenik often works late into the night before Easter, making sure the tradition lives on.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes future generations will keep it going.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Australia's insurance industry recorded an annual after-tax profit of $6.1 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's three times higher than the five-year average of $2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an annual review of the sector from consultancy firm KPMG, hiked up premiums, calmer weather and surging investment markets have all contributed to the boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the average customer paid 19.3 per cent more for home insurance and 12 per cent more for car insurance than they did the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if insurers are seeing such big profits, why are consumers still seeing insurance premiums rise?\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Blades is an insurance analyst for consumer advocacy group Choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says companies often justify premium hikes by pointing to external factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey point to a lot of external factors. So looking at cars for example, we don't make cars here in Australia, so we're reliant on overseas supply and those supply chains being disrupted, local parts manufacturers, but also external parts manufacturers. So insurers will definitely point to those delays and complex supply chains and also what's happening in world trade at the moment, it's quite a bit of a mess to put it bluntly. So yes, it's quite easy to point to those external factors. In saying that look for consumers, it's always important not to take these things on face value year on year, when you're getting your insurance renewals, you should always be shopping around to see what better values you can get to put the pressure back on insurers to make sure that they are not just taking the mickey with their increases.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the KPMG report says a return to positive profits may signal an end to double-digit premium hikes, it also says climate change means it's impossible to know what's around the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review has found the annual premium revenue jumped from $65.5 billion in 2023 to $68 billion in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia Davis is the Senior Policy and Communications officer at the Financial Rights Legal Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that while climate change may mean less profit from home and content insurance, it isn't the whole picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think when we're looking at these big profits, what we're seeing is a reflection of profits across all their types of insurance, you know, whether it's cyber insurance or liability insurance or, you know, any number of other products, mostly commercial stuff. They're making a ton of money, and they claim they're not making a lot of money on, you know, consumer insurance, home and content. But, you know, I would challenge that. The truth is, insurance pricing is really opaque. You know, we don't understand it. We don't get to see it. It's not transparent at all, and it's pretty frustrating for consumers when your prices keep going up and up, and there is just no explanation. Is it because your house is more dangerous, you know, is there a new flood map you don't know about, you know, why is the price, increasing so dramatically?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Blades says insurance companies often find loopholes in the system, allowing them to increase premiums even more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, so looking to health insurance, this is a really regulated market. There's billions of dollars going in subsidies and billions more indirectly through tax incentives going from government coffers into the health funds. We also know that there's a number of loopholes that the health funds use to increase premiums far higher than the averages suggest. We also know that there's perhaps some issues with transparency in terms of people being told in the news that they have an average increase of this, but they're actually getting a 12 per cent increase higher than they thought. So look, there's always plenty that the governments can be pushing to do with pushing for greater transparency and regulations there. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Climate Council has released a report revealing how areas at high risk of climate disaster will continue to see rising premiums.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report, titled At Our Front Door, says the increasing frequency and severity of climate related disasters in Australia is driving up insurance premiums across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review by KPMG says that with only two significant weather events and no weather catastrophes in 2024, insurance companies generated $566 million in losses from 49,000 claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis marks a significant drop from 2023, which saw $2.356 billion paid out by insurance companies across over 143,000 [[143,900]] claims from catastrophes and significant events.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Hall is the CEO of the Insurance Council of Australia, he says without adequate measures to address climate resilience, the cost of home insurance will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, we see it in the profit of insurance, insurance profits in Australia over the last five years. Three of those years, we've seen significant losses, particularly in home and contents, all driven completely by weather events. We've had a rapidly rising population. Those homes are growing often on the east coast on cheap land. That land is cheap for a reason. It floods. That comes with a cost when it comes to insuring those properties. So as we move forward in Australia, when we're talking about housing more and more people, we need to make sure that those homes are built in safe locations, in locations that don't flood, where the assets can remain intact for a longer period of time than just five years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor consumers, Mark Blades says simply looking around at different options online can save hundreds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlways be shopping around at every single year's renewal notice. Look, if I told you you could save hundreds of dollars just for say half a day's work, you'd probably be doing it right if you're looking at an hourly rate. And that's true if you're thinking about your home insurance, car insurance, health insurance, if you have it. Just looking at those three things that can be hundreds of dollars in savings you can make in just a few hours. And that's just by going online. Choice has comparisons for this, making sure you're looking at equivalent cover or less cover if you need it. And making sure as well when you're comparing insurers that you actually are looking at different competitors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the insurance industry itself, Julia Davis says more oversight is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we've been calling on government to establish a permanent National Insurance pricing monitor. We just think the general insurance industry is not meeting community expectations when it comes to pricing and needs more oversight\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As the election campaign hits a brief pause for the Easter weekend, Labor has positioned itself as the protector of penalty rates for employees working during the holiday period.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, the government announced it would enshrine penalty rates in law if re-elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat would prevent business groups, such as the Australian Retailers Association, from applying to the Fair Work Commission to cut the provisions from award agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial relations issues have worked in Labor's favour during the campaign, with polling showing Opposition leader Peter Dutton's short-lived pledge to force public servants back into the office fared poorly with voters.\n\n\n\nWith cost-of-living concerns at the forefront of the campaign, more polling has shown that how parties treat penalty rates could be a factor in how they vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential Research polling, commissioned by Australian Unions, found 70 per cent of respondents said protecting penalty rates for workers would be an issue voters take into consideration at the ballot box.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll also said 44 per cent of people were more likely to vote for a party that had policies in place to protect penalty rates, compared to 10 per cent being less likely to give the party support.\n\n\n\nMinister for Employment Murray Watt said workers deserve to be rewarded for working on weekends. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Retail worker Pauline Lethborg said the extra money from penalty rates went a long way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we lose penalty rates, it doesn't just affect the older workers, it's the younger ones as well. That bonus money goes to pay rent and food,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cost of living these days is very hard, right across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not like we're being paid $100 an hour, a lot of retail workers are on $20 to $25 an hour ... penalty rates is what gives them their supplement income.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year, the Australian Retail Association submitted a proposal for some staff at large companies to opt out of penalty rates in exchange for a 25 per cent raise.\n\n\n\nEmployer lobby Australian Industry Group has backed a similar push for the clerks and banking awards, arguing the rise in working from home has made it impractical for employees to log their hours and compounds the regulatory burden on employers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor had filed a submission to the Fair Work Commission opposing the changes, while also calling for the coalition to provide clarity on its penalty rate stance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround three million workers would be affected if Labor succeeds in legislating to protect penalty rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace Relations Minister Murray Watt said employees deserved to be rewarded for giving up family time to work during weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will always stand with workers to protect their wages so that we can help them deal with the pressures of today and get ahead in the future,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOpposition employment spokesperson Michaelia Cash said in February that penalty rates would not be cut under a future Coalition government, dismissing Labor attacks as a scare campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese and Peter Dutton spent Good Friday in Sydney, amid a lull in campaigning for the Easter period.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut electioneering will heat up again next week, with early voting opening on Tuesday ahead of the 3 May poll.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

I didn't do this to be praised. I didn't do this for any kind of praise or anything like that. I did this because my blood is not more important than those children's blood in Gaza. And just because I have a blue passport that says Australian on it, doesn't mean that I'm more worthy of living than those children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThree weeks ago, SBS News spoke with Dr Mustafa... as explosions were heard around the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City.\n\n\n\n\n\nMohammed Mustafa: \"We need to get medical equipment in here. Can you hear that?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRichelle Harrison Plesse: \"I didn't hear that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMohammed Mustafa: \"That's the bombs going off right now. It's pretty close by, but this has been going on relentlessly all night. I need the Australian public to realise the gravity of this situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Mustafa says he was working 23-hour shifts in what he calls an impossible situation, with overwhelming numbers of casualties and a severe shortage of medicine and equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would have people die waiting for their operations. We would have people die, because we didn't have scissors to cut through clothes to open people and try and control areas of breathing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Mustafa says the experience for medical workers in Gaza\u2026. can be traumatising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was a lot of children that died that night. There was just a lot people that I just couldn't help. It's part of the reason why I am keeping up the fight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that Dr Mohammed Mustafa is back in Australia, he\u2019s calling on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong to meet with returning aid workers like himself to hear what they saw in Gaza, and to help come up with a plan for medical support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong to sit down and talk with us. We've reached out to them so many times.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister has responded to a question from SBS about Dr Mustafa's calls for a direct meeting:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese: \"With respect. I haven't been sitting down watching the news for Mr Mustafa. I'm not aware of those (reports).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna Henderson: \"Are you open to hearing from them?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese: \"I don't know the issue that you raise, so I don't know who Mr Mustafa is. I'll have a look at it and give it consideration.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Dr Mustafa continues his plea for Australia's support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Help us in order to help those children in Gaza who are dying every single day.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're cute, they're cuddly, they're part of the family.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when they come through the doors of Melbourne's Lort Smith Animal Hospital, they can be pretty unwell.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd however cute the patients are, vets at the hospital, like Dr James McGregor, are asking pet owners to take extra care this Easter weekend to avoid a surprise visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most important things really are just keeping those sweet treats chocolates, anything with raisins - so hot cross buns especially - away from your dogs. And also for cats as well, Easter lilies pose probably the biggest risk - so keeping those away from you cat. To be honest not even having them in the house is ideal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd foods indulging an Easter sweet tooth - aren't the only danger.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw fish ... cooked bones ... grapes ... onions and garlic... corn on the cob ... nuts and meat trimmings ... Dr McGregor says they all have the potential to put pets in harm's way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we've seen a really wide range of cases to be honest with you. From mild vomiting and diarrhoea - to more severe instances where they've been in hospital for weeks with you know kidney issues. And the kidneys they don't re-generate - once that damage is done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advice to pet owners: keep a watchful eye on furry friends - and also keep a look out for a visit from the Easter bunny this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the children may not find all the chocolate you've hidden - never underestimate the tenacity of your average pet to hunt down and eat forbidden sweet treats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know you have got your labradors - they will do anything to grab that sweet treat off the side of the table. So it's really important to keep in mind those things - and they will try and outsmart us!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Simone Maher is the chief veterinary officer for insurance company PetSure.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told Channel Nine that owners have to make a real effort to keep the forbidden foods under lock and key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Putting them just on a table or something is just not enough. They've really got to be put away in a cupboard because they'll smell those delicious treats out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother vet, Megan Brashear says the amount of the wrong sort of food and the size of the pet will govern how bad the reaction is - but you'll soon know if your pet is in trouble:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'll tend to see signs in these patients about one to four hours post-ingestion . That's not a hard and fast rule but that's about the time that you're going to look for problems. First, we'll see GI (gastrointestinal) distress. In these more mild reactions, these animals are going to be vomiting and probably have diarrhoea. What really gets concerning about these guys is that the methylxanthines actually increase the calcium content inside the cell; and it increases cell excitability. So we start to see these muscle tremors and we can actually cardiac arrhythmias because of the chocolate that the animal has eaten.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if despite all precautions, your pet does manage to get hold of a forbidden food, Simone Maher says the advice is simple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the first thing you need to do is to contact your vet and there are some pieces of information that can be really helpful to work out how much danger your pet is in: and that's your dog's approximate weight. And if you can, what sort of chocolate they ate, the darker the chocolate, the more dangerous, the less they need to eat. So if you can provide that sort of information - that can be super helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Football coaches tend to fit the three categories former British Labour Cabinet Minister, Tony Benn, once ascribed to politicians: straight guys, fixers and maddies. Benn did not live to see the presidency of Donald Trump, who is a mix - a maddie who thinks he is a fixer. Similarly, most NRL coaches like to see themselves as straight guys, but the long-term ones, with nurtured media and headquarters contacts, can become adroit fixers. Souths coach Wayne Bennett is described by John Ribot, his former boss at the Broncos, as \u201cthe best politician in Australia\u201d. North Queensland Cowboys coach, Todd Payten, is a 180-degree straight guy. One incident defines him as the opposite of the fixer. It was a 2020 interview on Fox Sports where he revealed he had been offered the position as head coach of the Warriors but rejected it, hoping to secure a job back in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsofar as Payten was then an assistant to Steve Kearney, who had just been sacked, and it was only June, and he had already been appointed interim first grade coach, it intrigued coach watchers. Most coaches would have obfuscated, uttered ultimately meaningless commitments to the players, the club and the board. In other words, acted like a politician. It was the middle of the COVID bubble, and Payten now reveals what really happened. \u201cI did a pre-record for 360 with Ikin and Kent, about 15 minutes before it went to air. They asked me what I could bring to the Warriors and I spoke bullshit,\u201d Payten said. Todd Payten speaking to media in 2020 as interim Warriors coach. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThe interview didn\u2019t sit well with me. I thought, \u2018Shit, I\u2019ve straight out lied.\u2019 I had a sick feeling in the gut. So I called them back and did the interview live, telling the truth. I had rejected the Warriors job and I didn\u2019t have things sorted at home in Australia. I had been promised an interview for the Cowboys top job, but it was just an interview. \u201d Three months later Payten was announced as the Cowboys head coach on a three-year deal, beginning 2021. So, he was back in Townsville where he had joined the late Paul Green as an assistant in 2015, after three years on the coaching staff at Wests Tigers where he played 151 top-grade games, including the 2005 grand final win over the Cowboys. The evidence of his career as a straight guy in Townsville indicates he has, as he says, \u201cripped the band-aid off and told the truth to the players.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe stripped Jason Taumalolo of the captaincy shortly after the big lock had been given a 10-year contract and also benched him. He released Valentine Holmes, Chad Townsend and 2015 grand final hero Kyle Feldt at the end of last season and dropped Queensland Origin player Jeremiah Nanai after one game this year. Asked if he sees himself as a straight guy, Payten says, \u201cI\u2019m pretty much straight down the line. I like to keep it honest, keep the feedback continuous. I like to be open, truthful. But I try to massage the message and I haven\u2019t always got it right.\u201d He doesn\u2019t blow smoke up a talented player\u2019s tailpipe, nor play on a footballer\u2019s insecurity like a fiddle. Nor is he a caffeinated coach, of the maddie type. Jason Taumalolo of the Cowboys runs the ball. Credit: Getty Images Following a round five win over the Panthers, he told a press conference, \u201cI mightn\u2019t seem it, but I am ecstatic.\u201d He told me, \u201cI like to remain calm and level-headed. I\u2019m not overly emotional. I wouldn\u2019t like my personality to contribute to a loss, and I\u2019m aware that my energy in the dressing room is contagious, meaning the players can take it aboard, so I try to keep it steady.\u201d Again, he makes the confession: \u201cSometimes I haven\u2019t got it right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe perception of Payten as a straight guy is at odds with a burr from his past. A rumour has circulated for over a decade that he undermined head coach Michael Potter at Wests Tigers when he was an assistant. Mick Potter talking with Benji Marshall at the Wests Tigers in 2013. Credit: Brendan Esposito Unfortunately for Payten, an unfounded rumour in rugby league is not one that is easily lost. It is not unusual in professional football clubs for an assistant to white ant the top guy but it was more common in rugby league\u2019s three-grade era, where lower grade coaches coveted the top job. \u201cIt is incorrect,\u201d Payten says, admitting the Potter story has plagued him his entire career. \u201cIt is absolute bullshit. My reputation took a hit. That part of my life is over. I haven\u2019t said anything publicly previously, and I\u2019ve got no further comment.\u201d Potter described Wests Tigers at the time as \u201ca political hotbed.\u201d Because Payten switched straight from playing at Wests Tigers to an assistant coach\u2019s role, he became inextricably linked with the dissension of senior players disenchanted with Potter. Like the 1960s US sitcom, Peyton Place, it was a drama of hypocrisy and rumour, but not Payten\u2019s place to solve it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white ant label followed him, but Kearney, replaced mid-season by Payten in 2020, says, \u201cI didn\u2019t get any sense of Toddy undermining. We all bunkered down in our bubble and tried to look after each other.\u201d One question many NRL head coaches refuse to answer on the record for fear of upsetting the administration is whether the skill level of players has deteriorated. The NRL has spent record sums on development, but some coaches concede the skill of the new ones joining a club\u2019s top roster of 30 is not as proficient as those a decade ago. Payten is in an ideal situation to answer in that he joined the Cowboys as an assistant in 2015. \u201cWe won the comp ten years ago,\u201d he says with a rare chuckle, meaning a comparison with his current squad is unfair. Defence doesn\u2019t get taught well enough below NRL level Todd Payten While he lauds the stellar passing skills of those now coming to the top grade, he points out attack is only one half of the game. \u201cDefence doesn\u2019t get taught well enough below NRL level,\u201d he says. \u201cHow to move, step into the contest, fullbacks getting the numbers right from the back. With defence, you\u2019re starting at ground zero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Australian women are greater users of GP appointments than men. This trend is starker for longer appointments \u2013 women attended 59 per cent of short consults, according to Medicare data from 2023-2024, but 63 per cent of consults lasting at least 40 or 45 minutes. Loading Sylvia Freedman, the co-founder of endometriosis charity Endo Active, said longer appointments were essential for people with complex health conditions. \u201cConditions like endo are whole-of-body conditions, which means you could have three, four or five various symptoms and things impacting your immune system that are seemingly unrelated but that are all part of the same picture. That\u2019s complex. That takes time. You might have to get four different referrals in that appointment,\u201d Freedman said. As the gap widens between Medicare rebates and the cost of delivering care, some GP clinics are requesting that patients only discuss one issue during a standard consultation.\n\n\u201cWe need to [redesign] the system \u2026 so that we can actually have the time to listen and to be curious,\u201d said experienced Melbourne GP Associate Professor Ines Rio. AMA president Danielle McMullen. The AMA wants an overhaul of the Medicare rebate structure so that a greater range of longer consultations is funded. The current rebate for an appointment that lasts six minutes is the same as a consult that lasts 19 minutes. AMA president Dr Danielle McMullen said Medicare was introduced 40 years ago when \u201cpeople went to the GP with one or two quite simple problems\u201d. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the situation where we\u2019ve got more chronic disease, an ageing population, more mental healthcare issues, and, in fact, even for really relatively simple problems, healthcare has gotten more complicated.\u201d\n\nThe RACGP is calling for a 40 per cent boost to rebates for consults over 20 and 40 minutes, estimating its plan will prevent about 4000 emergency department presentations and 11,000 hospitalisations annually. In February, the Albanese government pledged more than $573 million to new women\u2019s health initiatives, including cheaper contraceptives and new rebates for menopause assessments at the GP. The announcement was welcomed by health groups and matched by the Coalition. Medical misogyny has been a focus of Albanese\u2019s Assistant Health Minister, Ged Kearney, who in 2023 asked members of the National Women\u2019s Health Advisory Council to update the National Women\u2019s Health Strategy to tackle the phenomenon. The government also commissioned a gender review of Medicare items. \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to women and have delivered historic reforms,\u201d Kearney said. Shadow health spokesperson Anne Ruston said the women\u2019s stories uncovered by this masthead were \u201cextremely distressing\u201d.\n\nAs well as pledging to match Labor\u2019s women\u2019s health funding package, the Coalition has promised a review to address gaps in Medicare funding of women-specific items. In 2024, the average time GPs spent with patients was 18.7 minutes, according to RACGP data. However, female GPs, who were far more likely to be consulted on women\u2019s health and mental health issues, spent longer \u2013 an average of 20.2 minutes with their patients, compared to 16.7 minutes for male GPs. Dr Samantha Saling, a GP with a private-billing practice in east Sydney, said her standard appointment was 20 minutes. This would be considered a \u201clong\u201d consultation under the current Medicare system. \u201cMy new patients appointments are much longer. I find that this is the minimum amount of time it takes to hear a patient\u2019s story, work through the nitty-gritty issues, and often there are multiple things that are brought up in a consult,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say 80 per cent of your diagnosis is in your history and your history comes from conversation. You need that time to get to the core of what the patient\u2019s agenda is and what medical issues are causing that. And then, of course, your psychosocial issues and factors as well.\u201d\n\nDr Jillann Farmer, a former United Nations medical director and a rural GP with additional specialist training, said improved GP rebate funding alone would not solve \u201cmedical misogyny\u201d, which was pervasive. \u201cEveryone, not just doctors and not just men, is socialised to believe that women exaggerate, that they should not be believed, that they are manipulative, emotional, stupid or hormone-mad,\u201d she said. She agreed, though, that there was an enormous need to better fund doctors who treat patients with complex presentations, in women\u2019s health and across the board. \u201cSo a doctor who sees a 90-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, and gives him 45 minutes, because he needs it \u2013 that doctor deserves to be paid as much as the doctor who sees five patients in those 45 minutes \u2013 perhaps even more, because the GP who successfully manages complexity saves the healthcare system an enormous amount of money,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cWe also need to remember that there is a really terrible GP shortage, especially in the regions. Those GPs that we do have are working absolutely flat out \u2013 no longer having the luxury of appointments held for \u201curgent\u201d same day appointments\u2026 If it can help keep doctors in the workforce, then that would help.\u201d",
