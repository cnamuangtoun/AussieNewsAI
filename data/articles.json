These guys are debt collectors',\" Thompson said.\n\nThe debt had been bought from Energy Australia by a third-party debt collection agency in 2021 called \ufeffPanthera Finance Group.\n\nThompson's father owed a total of $6395 on power bills dating back to 2019.\n\n\"It's not clear exactly how it happened, but it got to that giant size,\" she said.\n\nAfter the initial bill shock, Thompson was advised\ufeff to visit a financial counsellor, who gave her options to help reduce the debt due to hardship.\n\n\"They [Panthera] agreed to drop half the debt, but still wanted the other half paid,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"It was still $3150 roughly that they wanted Dad to pay. He's now on the aged pension, he's paying about 30 per cent of that in rent... that's a lot of money.\"\n\nThe debt has been paid incrementally by around $50 per fortnight.\n\nIt was a small weight off Thompson and her father's shoulders.\n\nPanthera Finance Group was recently acquired by Francom Group, which honoured the debt agreement.\n\nNow, there is a little over $1750 left in the debt owing.\ufeff\n\nAfter the initial bill shock, Thompson was advised\ufeff to visit a financial counsellor,.

EnergyAustralia provides a range of support options for customers facing financial hardship, helping them manage their energy bills, stay connected, and strengthen their ability to pay in the long run.\n\nOur EnergyAssist Hardship Program is our main support avenue for residential customers experiencing financial stress. Case managers work with customers to review their financial situation, tailor assistance and support throughout their challenge period. The assistance includes tailored payment plans, arrangements for payment extensions, support for accessing government grants and concessions, financial counselling referrals as well as relief from fees for missed payments.\n\nWe continue to look at the most effective way of reaching vulnerable customers and work with other retailers, the Australian Energy Council and consumer groups. For example, partnering with Uniting to provide energy efficiency support to vulnerable customers and working with the financial and telecommunications sectors as a founding member of Thriving Communities Partnership.\n\nWe encourage any customer concerned about bill payments to reach out as soon as possible, since earlier contact typically leads to more available options and support before any debt accumulates. By staying engaged, we can better understand a customer's circumstances, offer timely support, and help prevent unnecessary stress.",

        "text": "Ten years ago, Lawrence Ranson was working on a Christmas tree farm in Germany when he realised there was a gaping hole in the Australian market.\n\n\"We only had one variety of Christmas tree [in Australia], and only a couple of farms in the whole country, really big ones,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought there was an opportunity there, and I started trying to grow these strange trees from all over the world, and failing in the beginning.\"\n\nMr Ranson with one of the first Christmas trees he grew in Wollongong. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nThe start-up business in a Wollongong backyard was plagued by massive power bills and tested the goodwill of Mr Ranson's housemates.\n\nHe moved to a cooler climate on the outskirts of Bathurst in Central West NSW, and now supplies the classic Christmas trees radiata pine and Douglas fir to growers right across Australia.\n\nHe grows seedlings for other Christmas tree farmers, and cut trees for the public.\n\nChristmas tree hunters travel from right across the central west to secure the best tree. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"We're doing 200,000 to 300,000 seedlings a year now, supplying other farms around Australia \u2026 we now grow most of the seedlings of Christmas tree farmers in Australia,\" Mr Ranson said.\n\n\"We have in the tens of thousands, in the ground, they take seven or eight years to mature. So, we have a cycle and we're planning about 10,000 a year, and this year we've cut 6,000 or 7,000.\n\n\"They go to Sydney, they go to Brisbane, Melbourne, all over the place.\"\n\nThe Christmas tree farm grows about 40,000 cut trees. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nNative and exotic Christmas trees\n\nLooking to expand beyond the classic spruce and fir Christmas trees, Mr Ranson has made it his mission to bring new varieties to living spaces.\n\nWhile there are no specifications of what he looks for in a tree, he believes the quirkier the better.\n\n\"There'd be 120-odd varieties that we're experimenting with, maybe 30 or 40 look promising,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got blue spruces with like a bright blue colour, and we've got firs from Russia and from Canada and all sorts of places.\"\n\nA few hundred other species of trees are being trialled to grow for Christmas trees. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton )\n\nWith strict biosecurity rules on seed imports, Mr Ranson turned to the resources around him.\n\nHe found that Orange, an hour west of his Christmas tree farm, was a playground for propagation.\n\n\"Collectors 100 years ago in towns like Orange had planted these trees, one or two of them, and we found them \u2026 and we go and collect our own seed, climb the trees and pick the cones,\" Mr Ranson said.\n\nLawrence Ranson owns the Christmas tree farm near Bathurst. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"There's so much in Australia if you look around \u2026 whenever we're driving somewhere I'm like 'oh my God, it's a giant sequoia' and we'll pull over and get cuttings or get seeds straight away.\n\n\"There are botanic gardens, they're often quite helpful, people's front yards, I've traded a case of beer for a tree climb if they let me collect big sacks of seeds.\"\n\nDescribing Orange as a \"hot spot for cool stuff\", Mr Ranson can often be spotted climbing the trees in high-vis around the area.\n\nBuyers pick their trees, which are then cut down to be taken home. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nHe said the climbing part of the job came about by necessity.\n\n\"The cones [that contain the seeds] are always at the top of course,\" Mr Ranson said.\n\n\"By the time they fall, often the cones are already open and there's no seeds left.\"\n\n'Pretty funny looking things'\n\nMr Ranson has always found joy seeing his customers happy at the farm with their families.\n\nBut he said it was not always about how \"Christmassy\" the tree looked.\n\nThe farm grows trees in all different shapes and sizes. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"We've got Huon pines and they're like a Christmas tree, but with ... a little droopy top which is pretty cute. They do really well,\" he said.\n\n\"There's some pretty funny looking things, you never know, you'd be surprised what people want.\n\n\"It's fun, you come with the kids and they like to be part of it and choose a tree.\"",

Everything just eats so beautifully,\" he said.\n\nGrowers are reporting a lower lychee yield this year. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nFor consumers, prices are slightly cheaper compared to last Christmas, when the price sat at around $25 per kilo.\n\nMr Griffin said larger fruit was selling for closer to $20 per kilo, but the smaller fruit could fetch $12 per kilo.\n\n\"I have seen stuff down for $10 a kilo on farm, but that's your second-grade stuff, but still eating beautifully,\" he said.\n\nBut the drop in prices is not because supply is higher than last year.\n\nLarry Griffin says the lychees coming through to him are the best quality he has ever seen. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nRain impacts\n\nPresident of the Australian Lychee Growers Association Derek Foley said heavy rain had impacted the number of lychees hitting the market floor.\n\nHe said this caused the price to fluctuate.\n\n\"There's quite a bit of rain through parts of [the lychees] flowering and that's washed the pollen out of some of the flowers and certainly interrupted the crop,\" he said.\n\n\"But having said that, some very good crops in the north, but there's also some not so good and that same syndrome has seems to be appearing now on the Sunshine Coast.\n\n\" Some farms that are very regular producers of fruit year in, year out have been affected also, apparently, by all the wet weather that they've experienced. \"\n\nWet weather has impacted the number of lychees coming to market. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nHowever, Mr Griffin said there would be ample supply through the Christmas period.\n\n\"Definitely in a few weeks we will see it start to taper off at some point in January, a lot of that's going to be on how much demand soaks up that volume as well,\" he said.\n\nHe said most of his lychees were sourced from the Mareeba area and he focused on providing to hospitality businesses and the retail sector.\n\nPrices are lower than last year, which he said could be due to a lower overall retail demand.\n\n\"We're coming in the Christmas, everyone's doing a bit tough, there's talk about interest rates going up. I think that all kind of plays a part into how keen people are to spend their money,\" Mr Griffin said.\n\n\"But [lychees] have definitely taken off this year for us in sales.\"\n\nCome January, lychee supply will start to weaken. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nSome varieties producing less\n\nOn Salvatore Girgenti's lychee farm in Mareeba, he said some varieties were producing well this year, like the B3s, but others had seen a low yield.\n\nSo far, most trees have only been producing 50 per cent of their desired volumes.\n\n\"It's weather affected mostly \u2014 long wet season two [years] in a row and just fluctuations, big fluctuations, in the weather,\" he said.\n\n\"Last year we probably had more fruit, with younger trees.\"\n\nHe expected the price for lychees would increase soon.\n\n\"You've got other areas which I believe have been affected [by weather] as well, Bundaberg, for example, has had some bad luck,\" Mr Girgenti said.\n\n\"The other coastal areas that from what I'm hearing are wrapping up there picking already and this area, there's a few farmers that have finished already.\n\n\"I feel the price should be going up from here. It probably went down prematurely. It has been a strange pricing this year.\"",

(ABC Open contributor: Happy Snapper)\n\nThe company will also pay $25,000 to the EPA to cover the investigative and legal costs it spent probing the dust events from the mine's tailings dam.\n\nThe EPA's Executive Director of Operations Steve Beaman said in a statement these sorts of agreements led to effective outcomes for the community.\n\n\"Since these incidents, Cadia has acted to minimise dust events, including installing an irrigation system on their northern tailings storage facility,\" he said.\n\n\"[Cadia] is continuing work to manage dust emissions in the long term.\"\n\nThe five locations of the DustTrak monitoring stations are yet to be determined.

        "text": "The Southern 80 water ski race on the Murray River has been cancelled for a second year as the sport awaits the findings of a NSW Maritime safety investigation.\n\nThe March 2026 race at Echuca-Moama would have been the first since 2024, when skier Luke Wentworth died participating in the event.\n\nThe 40-year-old from Melbourne was one of four people killed in the sport last year, triggering a pause on racing by Ski Racing Australia in June 2024.\n\nNSW Maritime launched a safety investigation, which is now complete but its findings are yet to be publicly released.\n\nSteve Shipp says another cancellation is a blow to Echuca-Moama and other Murray River towns. (ABC Riverina: Romy Stephens)\n\nThe lack of findings and recommendations has prompted Moama Water Sports Club, which organises the Southern 80, to cancel next year's event.\n\nClub president Steve Shipp said it had been expecting the report any day for a couple of weeks.\n\n\"We just haven't got enough time now to run the event,\" he said.\n\n\" The time taken to get this done is, frankly, far too long. \"\n\nA Transport for NSW Maritime spokesperson confirmed the report would be released in weeks but did not respond directly to a question about the delay.\n\nSouthern 80 organisers not consulted\n\nThe Southern 80 involves boats pulling two skiers through more than 120 Murray River bends at speeds in excess of 160 kilometres per hour.\n\nMr Shipp said the club had not been contacted by NSW Maritime investigators, despite the race's history of fatalities.\n\n\"If there's recommendations for our club I'll certainly be asking where [they came] from when there's been no discussion with us about it,\" he said.\n\nIan Tricker, Nathan Miller, Ray Ball and Reece Simmonds of team TR after winning the Southern 80 in 2019. (Supplied: Ian Tricker)\n\nIan Tricker has been racing in the Southern 80 since the late 1980s and is the owner and driver of TR, the team that holds the overall record for fastest race time.\n\nMr Tricker was sceptical about the race's future.\n\n\"It's debatable when, unfortunately if ever, the [Southern] 80 will return,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Southern 80 and potentially all Australian racing should move to one skier per boat, rather than two.\n\n\"It may be time to make the change \u2026 the rest of the world [events are] all one skier,\" he said.\n\n\" It's a no-brainer to me. If it saves just one fall, how can you argue with that? \"\n\nTeam TR racing in the 2019 Southern 80.

        "text": "Standing beneath the imposing stone walls of one of the most ancient and revered sites in the West Bank, Yishai Fleischer was blunt in his assessment of its significance in modern times.\n\n\"It's something that should be bringing people together, but oftentimes places like this actually make people jealous and tear them apart,\" he said.\n\nMr Fleischer wanted to meet the ABC at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the city of Hebron, south of Jerusalem.\n\nThe site is said to be the burial place of the prophet Abraham, a significant figure in Judaism, Islam and Christianity, and is considered one of the holiest places in all three religions.\n\nControl of the building has been wrested between conquering forces for centuries and the structure today, which sits over the cave where Abraham and his family are buried, is half synagogue and half mosque.\n\nA drone view of the Ibrahimi Mosque, which Jews call the Tomb of the Patriarchs. (Reuters: Ilan Rosenberg)\n\nMr Fleischer's description of the place was a simple summation of a problem dogging this part of the world, but belies the severity of the situation facing the West Bank as his fellow Israeli settlers demand control over areas where millions of Palestinians live.\n\n\"It's a Jewish building on top of Jewish tombs, and the Jewish people have been living at this town and praying here at this tomb for the last 3,500 years,\" he argued.\n\n\"For the Jewish people to survive in this region, we have to be strong in terms of our identity, in terms of our economy, in terms of our military, in terms of our spirituality.\n\n\"Haters will have to go \u2026 we have to be strong here and push back in forces that want to destroy us.\"\n\nIt is a view that permeates the settler movement, and some other corners of the Israeli society \u2014 that all the land west of the Jordan River is Jewish land, and any action to restore control is a God-given right.\n\nThat belief has spurred some within Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition, often referred to as the most right-wing government in Israel's history, to push for legislation formally annexing the West Bank.\n\nDespite his backing of Israel on a range of other matters, that has been a step too far for the US President Donald Trump, who in September told journalists: \"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.\"\n\nBut many believe it is something of an academic argument \u2014 that annexation has already happened as a result of Israel's vice-like control of the West Bank and its government's support for Jewish settlers.\n\nTomb of the Patriarchs is said to be the burial place of the prophet Abraham. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nEarlier this week, Israel approved 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank \u2014 including re-establishing two settlements that were dismantled two decades ago.\n\nSettlements are considered illegal under international law, but many figures in the Israeli government and settler movement see the territory as their land.\n\n\"The Jewish people are resettling this land, this is the heartland of our story, this is the DNA of our people-hood,\" Mr Fleischer said.\n\n\"We're connected to this thing inextricably; we're not going to be connected this way to Brooklyn or to Sydney or Melbourne. It's not the same.\"\n\nPalestinians live in fear\n\nOn a hill overlooking the Tomb, anti-settlement activist Issa Amro's house is encased in tall fencing, which he argued was necessary to protect him from settler attacks \u2014 everything from rock throwing to fire bombings.\n\n\"I feel that I live in a cage,\" he said.\n\n\"My neighbourhood is caged, my city is caged and my country is caged.\"\n\nIssa Amro feels threatened by Israeli settlers. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nWhen the ABC tried to approach Mr Amro's house, an Israeli soldier blocked the path \u2014 insisting foreigners could not pass through an Israeli-dominated area en route to the Palestinian community he lived in.\n\nThe 45-year-old said he had never felt free in the West Bank, labelling Israel's control of the territory as \"apartheid\".\n\nBut he said the situation had deteriorated significantly since October 7, 2023.\n\n\"[Israeli soldiers] got all the support to do whatever they can, because they can do it without any accountability, without anybody saying this is wrong or this is bad,\" Mr Amro said.\n\nTomb of the Patriarchs seen from behind Issa Amro's fence. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nHe said he had been attacked multiple times by settlers and soldiers, and that Israeli authorities turned a blind eye to the conduct.\n\n\"If you have protection and support and finance coming from the Israeli government to the fanatic and extreme Israeli soldiers and settlers, it means it's a state terror,\" he said.\n\n\"The Israeli government now is acting outside the Israeli law and even the international law, and for sure they are acting outside the Jewish principles and morals.\"\n\nAnnexation underway\n\nMoves to impose Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank have been underway for decades, but the issue has taken on a different tone and tempo in recent months.\n\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both subject to sanctions by countries including Australia for their violent rhetoric towards Palestinians, have led the charge.\n\nMr Fleischer said Australia's sanctions against those ministers amounted to \"misunderstanding and antisemitism\".\n\n\"To have Australia getting in our business without clearly understanding, and eroding our sovereignty by sanctioning our people \u2026 is an abhorrent act of sabotage,\" Mr Fleischer argued.\n\nThe proposal to approve 19 new settlements was introduced to Israeli cabinet by the pair. When announcing it on social media, Mr Smortrich said it was \"correct and moral Zionism\".\n\n\"Within three years we have regulated 69 new settlements \u2014 a record like no other,\" he wrote.\n\nNew settlements overlook Palestinian homes. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nMr Smotrich's portfolios give him responsibility for approving and expanding settlements, something he has done with considerable vigour since taking office.\n\nIsraeli media has reported Mr Smotrich is pushing for hundreds of millions of shekels to be spent on settlements and outposts, as part of the Israeli government's upcoming budget.\n\nIn October the Isareli parliament, the Knesset, gave preliminary approval to a bill that would effectively annex the West Bank \u2014 just as the US Vice-President JD Vance was wrapping up his visit to Israel.\n\nHow a four-day siege symbolises the struggle for statehood A quiet town north-east of Ramallah is on the front line of a territorial battle in the West Bank.\n\n\"If it was a political stunt it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally take some insult to it,\" Mr Vance said when asked about the vote.\n\n\"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel, the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\"\n\nMr Trump also in October told Time Magazine: \"Israel would lose all of its support from the US if that happened.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu's Likud party did not back the legislation and criticised those who pushed for the vote.\n\nAlthough almost two months later, the prime minister said annexation remained \"a subject of discussion\" during a press conference alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who had just warned Israel against any measures to annex the West Bank.\n\n\"There is no change of the status quo. Israel today controls the security between the Jordan River and the sea,\" Mr Netanyahu said.\n\n\"[Annexation] is not something that I think we're headed in the coming time, it'll be a question that will be raised eventually, but not right away.\"\n\nAll entry and exit points into the West Bank are operated by Israel. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nIssa Amro said the Trump intervention meant very little to people living in the West Bank.\n\n\"The Israeli government would not be able to maintain the occupation for that long without applied support of many, many Western countries,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the main countries which is blindly supporting the Israeli government \u2026 it's the American administration.\n\n\" Donald Trump is part of the problem \u2026 he's not peacemaker for me he's a war maker. \"\n\nMichael Sfard, one of Israel's leading human rights lawyers, said the intervention by the Trump administration was important \u2014 but argued it only went so far.\n\n\"It has to be acknowledged and it has to be confronted that Israel \u2026 has annexed the territory and is treating it as its sovereign territory,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"We're building settlements there, we are moving communities from one place to another, we're digging out natural resources, we're exploiting the territory, and we're planning it for a very long term.\n\n\"This is not an ordinary occupation \u2014 an occupation has to be temporary, and the occupier is not to change the occupied territory at all, as much as possible.\n\n\"We're doing the opposite, we're perpetuating our domination in the West Bank, and in the last two years, we've done that in a way that, for me, this is annexation, even if it hasn't been declared.\"\n\nMichael Sfard says Israel has effectively annexed the West Bank. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nAttacks on the rise\n\nAcross the West Bank, there are roughly half a million Jewish settlers living in around 140 settlements and up to 300 outposts, a type of settlement that is unauthorised by the Israeli government but often receives retroactive approval.\n\nThat figure increases to around 700,000 when including East Jerusalem \u2014 which most countries, including Australia, do not recognise as sovereign Israeli territory after Israel seized it in 1967. It remains on the opposite side of Israel's border wall from the rest of the Palestinian territory.\n\nWhile the settlements are considered unlawful under international law, they are supported by Israeli legislation, including instances where communities have been retroactively legalised years after being built on Palestinian land.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority (PA) exercises control over some parts of the West Bank, including cities such as Ramallah and Nablus, but Israeli security forces maintain a significant presence right across the territory.\n\nA barrier made of concrete and fencing separates most of the West Bank from Israel and East Jerusalem. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nAll entry and exit points into the West Bank are operated by Israel \u2014 including the international land border with Jordan, where the Allenby Bridge crossing provides the only transit option to Palestinians without permits to enter Israel.\n\nIsraeli authorities have permanently or temporarily restricted access to some parts of the West Bank, through major operations such as counterterrorism raids in refugee camps, as well as more routine measures such as closing roads and building checkpoints to stifle free movement.\n\nViolence by settlers towards Palestinians has also surged in recent months. In October, the United Nations recorded the highest number of cases since it began keeping records in 2006, with 264 attacks.\n\nYishai Fleischer, armed with a rifle during his interview with the ABC, downplayed the settler violence. Instead, he blamed Palestinians for fuelling conflict across the West Bank.\n\n\"As in all societies, we have members of the society that are more aggressive and maybe take it to illegal actions,\" he said.\n\n\"If there's illegal action being done, they'll be taken care of.\"\n\nSettler attacks in West Bank during olive picking season Settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank ramps up every year during olive harvest, but a brazen attack caught on camera has left the community shaken.\n\nHe said Australia did not understand the severity of the situation, and said that opposing settlements was tantamount to \"standing against Jewish survival\".\n\nMichael Sfard argued the intensity of Israeli actions in the West Bank is unlike anything he has seen in three decades.\n\n\"We have the most radical government Israel has ever had, with the settler movement basically a very powerful element of this government,\" he said.",

(ABC Riverina: Jess Scully)\n\nGail Driscoll, a councillor and member of The Rock Progress Association, said the village had attracted young families due to its housing affordability, but residents enjoyed how self-sufficient the community was.\n\n\"Some small communities do exist without those services [but] The Rock \u2026 provides to all demographics,\" she said.\n\n\"We also have a fantastic school that has before-and-after-school care.\"\n\nResidents and council are working hard to bring a petrol station back to the village. (ABC Riverina: Melinda Hayter)\n\nAlthough many bases are covered, there is one basic amenity the community is working with council to try to bring back.\n\n\"A servo most definitely would probably make it a town again,\" Mr Golds said.\n\nThe progress association and council have been working with outside investors in order to bring fuel back.\n\nBut for what it still lacks in services, The Rock makes up for in its people and its sense of community.\n\nAnd for Ms Payne, that is what matters most.\n\n\"I love it.

(Supplied: Via Stidwell)\n\nMan in tree was last resort\n\nMr Jack said placing himself in the canopy of the burn site was a last resort for the group.\n\n\"From past experience with all of the letter writing and the work that various people have put in over quite a few years to try and modify the DBCA's approach to burnings \u2026 nothing else was working,\" he said.\n\n\" This block was imminent, they'd done the scrub rolling already, they were all set to go. We had to do something. \"\n\nRed tingles can live for more than 500 years and reach heights of 75 metres, and only grow in WA's famed Valley of the Giants.\n\n'Operational priorities'\n\nThere have been repeated calls for the government to amend its prescribed burning program after a burn 12 months ago felled more than 100 trees, including a century-old red tingle.\n\nVia Stidwell says the group will continue to push for the removal of tingle trees from prescribed burns. (Supplied: Via Stidwell)\n\nMt Clare Tingle Community Blockade spokesperson Via Stidwell previously told the ABC the group was prepared to man the platform until its demands were met.\n\nHowever last Friday, the Mount Clare block and two others \u2013 totalling more than 1,000 hectares \u2013 were removed from the DBCA's 2025-26 burn plan.\n\nIn a letter from DBCA director-general Stuart Smith to protesters, seen by the ABC, Mr Smith said burns in Mount Clare, Nornalup and Coalmine containing tingles were being cancelled due to \"operational priorities\".\n\nMr Smith wrote the burns were expected to remain on the DBCA's three-year burn options list, but he was willing to discuss longer-term management of fire-sensitive ecosystems.\n\nPaul Jack says installing the platform was a final effort to get the DBCA to listen to concerned locals. (Supplied: Via Stidwell)\n\nFuture protests expected\n\nMr Jack said while the department's decision was a temporary reprieve from burning, it was a positive outcome for the group.\n\n\"The prospect of having to keep the campaign alive and go all the way through Christmas and so forth wasn't a very happy one,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm absolutely relieved that we've got extra breathing space now to negotiate further to get these particular forests, especially tingle, off the burn list.\"\n\nAs Mr Jack returned to the forest floor, a second protester took his place for one night before the group ended the protest action.\n\nThe Mt Clare Tingle Community Blockade opposes the burning of the tingle forest. (Supplied: Via Stidwell)\n\nMs Stidwell said the group would continue to protest future burns until tingles were excluded from all prescribed burns.\n\n\"The community has shown by the stand taken at Mount Clare, and with the broad community support received for it, that we are not willing to see any more tingle burns occur; not this year, not any year,\" she said.\n\nHundreds of trees felled in controlled burn DBCA documents confirm the unprecedented scale of damage to an ecological hotspot destroyed by a government-lit fire.\n\nThe DBCA was sent a list of questions about the future of its burn program, including how many burn sites included tingle trees and if they would be removed from its burn list.\n\nA DBCA spokesperson said prescribed burns were based on risk management, operational requirements and implementing government policy.\n\nThey said the department was committed to science-based fire management to protect community safety and the unique ecological values of the South West.\n\nJess Beckerling says DBCA's actions are a positive step forward. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nGreens MLC Jess Beckerling said the department's response was the most significant indication it was open to amending its burn program since it had been placed under the spotlight.\n\n\"It was heartening to read that DBCA recognises tingle forests are sensitive ecosystems and is willing to keep having the conversation with the community,\" she said.\n\n\"Tingles must be added to the list of values that are protected from fire.\"",

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nPoor sleep, unhealthy diets and the impacts of stress all compound for people who are homeless, some of whom are pushed to the streets because of health complications.\n\n\"When people do end up on the streets, it vastly affects their mental health and their physical health,\" Ms Bogoias said.\n\n\" That just makes it more and more difficult for them to find their way out of homelessness. \"\n\nWithout stable routines or even phones to keep track of time and appointments, it can be hard for people to look after their own health, she said.\n\n\"All of those things are just overlooked.

        "text": "Drastic changes in salinity levels and water flows are being reported at farms neighbouring South32's Worsley bauxite mine in Western Australia.\n\nIn recent years, some properties have gone dry, while others have had rapid rises in groundwater levels, causing waterlogging and degradation of land.\n\nSome residents attribute the hydrological changes to South32's nearby mining operations.\n\nRussell Reynolds's farming property sits between the Mount Saddleback mining area and the Hotham River, near Boddington, 130 kilometres south of Perth.\n\nHe said his spring-fed dam was almost undrinkable because of rising salinity.\n\nMr Reynolds also claims a surface stream that once ran each winter has been dry now for two years.\n\n\"It's a bit disappointing, because they've made no effort whatsoever about controlling water flow so we still get enough water,\" Mr Reynolds said.\n\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) confirmed it was currently investigating Mr Reynolds's claims.\n\n\"DWER has kept Mr Reynolds informed throughout the investigation, which may take several months to complete due to its hydrogeological complexity,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nSouth32 has approval to take 900 million litres of groundwater a year, most of which is used for dust suppression. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nMiner draws millions of litres\n\nIn February this year, South32 received state and federal approval to increase its groundwater use from 500 million litres to 900 million litres a year, primarily for dust suppression on haulage roads.\n\n\"It'll only get worse,\" Mr Reynolds said.\n\n\"If you haven't got enough water to mine that size area, you shouldn't be allowed to mine that size area.\"\n\nMr Reynolds blames his water issues on a series of major production bores, known as the Tunnell Road borefield.\n\nRussell Reynolds says the seasonal surface water stream on his property has run dry for two years. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nThe borefield draws water from an underground stream that runs through the Saddleback Timber Reserve and onto Mr Reynolds's property, filling his dams.\n\nIn 1996, the borefield supplied 85 per cent of water for the mine, with an average of 465,000 litres of water being extracted every day.\n\nFrom December last year to June this year, South32 drew an average of 665,000 litres per day from Tunnell Road bores, with eight trigger-level exceedences, according to a recent compliance report.\n\nThe report noted dryer-than-average rainfall contributed to higher monthly water demand, but overall water usage from the borefield remained below recommended yield.\n\n\"Basically, they're taking it before it can get to the property,\" Mr Reynolds said.\n\n\"To me, that bore system should be restricted.\"\n\nRussell Reynolds says the water issues on his farm constitute a breach of South32's environmental approval conditions. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nRising salinity levels\n\nHe said the reduced groundwater flow was also to blame for a 500 per cent increase in salinity levels of his spring-fed dam.\n\nHe claims the dam's total dissolved solids (TDS) level jumped from 180 milligrams per litre (mg/L) in 2014 to 1,100mg/L in 2025.\n\nHowever, the ABC was unable to verify the original 2014 test results.\n\nAnything above 1,200 mg/L is considered unacceptable for drinking, according to national drinking water guidelines.\n\nRussell Reynolds said the regulator needed to step up and hold the mining company to account. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nIn 2020, South32 commissioned a report on ground and surface water as part of the expansion proposal approved earlier this year.\n\nThe report shows higher salinity levels in the Tunnell Road borefield, with average TDS levels ranging from 163\u20131,510 mg/L, compared to 160\u2013391mg/L measured in a 1995 submission to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).\n\n\"Right at the moment, they don't have anything to control salt level, and they know exactly what's happening,\" Mr Reynolds said.\n\nSouth32 issued a brief statement noting it was aware of the \"matters that have been raised\" but did not respond directly to the ABC's questions.\n\n\"Worsley Alumina manages and monitors groundwater usage, quality, levels and its response in accordance with its approved Water Management Plan,\" a South32 spokesperson said.\n\nA line of dead native trees marks the water course that appeared on one farm in a matter of years. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nMining and water mounding\n\nOther farming properties beside the Mount Saddleback mining area have had sharp increases in groundwater levels and flow.\n\nThe ABC visited a property with a surface water stream that had appeared out of the adjacent forest within the last four years.\n\nThe stream's course through the farm is marked by a cluster of dead jarrah trees, and it has white salt scald beside it.\n\nThe ABC has seen evidence of salinity levels in dams increasing by more than 100 per cent in four years on other nearby farming properties.\n\nAnn Choong, a trained lawyer and member of the environmental group Dwellingup Discovery Forest Defenders, believes the changes are a result of water mounding, which occurs when forest is cleared, and cap rock is removed.\n\nSatellite images from 2015 and 2025 show the changes in surface water flow on a farming property beside Mt Saddleback. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nWater mounding occurs when more groundwater flows downhill, increasing the water table and salinity in low-lying areas.\n\nSouth32's Water Management Plan identifies water mounding as a potential impact of its operations, noting the risk of increases in salinity in groundwater and changes in surface water flows associated with changes in land use and land form.\n\n\"These impacts are interconnected and have a limited duration associated with the temporary change in land use during mining activities,\" the management plan states.\n\n\" Groundwater levels typically return to those equivalent to the unmined situation within five to 20 years. \"\n\nSouth32 says it manages and monitors groundwater usage in accordance with its approved management plan. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\nBreach of 'no adverse impact' condition\n\nDr Choong has been working to bring the concerns of the few neighbouring landholders to the attention of the regulator.\n\nShe said many farmers had already sold their properties to the mining company.\n\n\"There aren't a lot of people to speak up about what happens to the land,\" she said.\n\n\"In 20\u201340 years, the ore will run out, and the question is, what are we going to have in terms of farmland?\" she asked.\n\nSouth32's 2020 groundwater study concluded declining rainfall was primarily responsible for rising salinity, not bauxite mining.\n\nAnn Choong has been helping landowners raise their water concerns with the regulator. (ABC South West: Jon Daly)\n\n\"Bauxite mining in the Saddleback area does not appear to be causing any additional observable salinity increase over and above that recognised as background response to regional rainfall decline,\" the report stated.\n\nMr Reynolds argues his experience challenges that finding, and the impact on his property constitutes a breach of environmental conditions set on South32's Worsley mine expansion.\n\n\"The emphasis is on DWER. How about [you] start acting on what you've put in place?\" Mr Reynolds said.\n\nAs a condition of South32's expansion last year, the state government said there had to be \"no adverse impacts to neighbouring groundwater users as a result of the proposal\".\n\n\"At this stage, DWER has not yet determined whether any adverse impacts have occurred,\" a DWER spokesperson said.",

        "text": "Every December, choirs from around the world come together to perform Messiah by 18th-century composer George Frideric Handel.\n\nIn Australia, there is at least one performance in most capital cities.\n\nYou can usually hear Messiah broadcast on radio stations like ABC Classic in the lead-up to both Christmas and Easter.\n\n\"When Handel wrote Messiah in 1741, he would never have thought it would become one of the most performed works in the canon,\" says Andrew Ford, host of The Music Show on Radio National.\n\nHandel's Messiah with the Brisbane Chamber Choir The Brisbane Chamber Choir celebrate Christmas with Handel's magnificent oratorio about the life of Christ.\n\nHandel didn't set out to write a Christmas classic.\n\nBut as an oratorio that tells the story of Jesus's life from birth through to his resurrection, it makes sense for the season.\n\nIn spite of a complicated and controversial history, the music's vision of a better world, coupled with memorable tunes and associations with charitable causes, makes Messiah a Christmas staple for the ages.\n\nHow Handel composed Messiah\n\nUnlike an opera, where there are stage props and singers have to sing and act, an oratorio tells the story through words and music.\n\nIn Messiah, sometimes soloists will sing arias accompanied by the orchestra. Other times the full choir takes centre stage.\n\n\"[Messiah] is one of the most remarkable examples of the way in which words and music can work together to create more than the sum of the parts,\" says Charles King, a historian and author of Every Valley, a book exploring the origin story of the oratorio.\n\nHandel wrote Messiah in just over three weeks. (Portrait: Balthasar Denner)\n\nMessiah's fame is entwined with the story of its creation, King tells The Music Show.\n\nHandel wrote Messiah in just over three weeks, by using sections of music he had already composed in the past.\n\nIt was written at a point when Handel's career in London was flagging.\n\n\"He was venerated as a composer, but [had lost his edginess],\" King says.\n\nIn addition to his position as a court composer for the British monarchy, Handel turned to affluent patrons to sustain his career.\n\nOne of these patrons, Charles Jennens, was a wealthy landowner, an amateur musician and librettist.\n\nIt was Jennens who selected the biblical verses that would become the text of Messiah.\n\n\"[Jennens] suffered very deeply from what we might now call bipolar disorder or chronic depression,\" King says.\n\nJennens turned to the scriptures to create \"his own kind of ladder out of this abyss,\" King says.\n\nDespite Messiah's vision of a better world, it was born during one of the darkest periods of history.\n\n\"Most of the wealth of Europe was the result of slavery [and] the slave trade,\" Ford reminds us.\n\n\"The story of enslavement is absolutely entwined with art in this period in a way that we simply can't deny,\" King says.\n\nKing found that Jennens was a shareholder in the South Sea Company and Handel received portions of his salary through holding accounts in the Royal African Company, one of the major slave firms in the 1700s.\n\nHow Messiah became a Christmas tradition\n\nMessiah's first performance took place in April 1742 in Dublin.\n\nMessiah was first performed in the Musick Hall in Fishamble Street, Dublin. (Wikimedia Commons: The Musical Times)\n\nJennens wasn't in attendance. He thought that Handel had \"run off\" to Dublin with his precious words.\n\nThe first cast of Messiah included Susannah Cibber, a stage actor and low-voiced contralto whose loveless marriage had resulted in personal scandals and legal battles.\n\nCibber sang one of the most dramatic and memorable arias, He Was Despised, which includes the words: \"A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.\"\n\n\"This scandalous, notorious woman, was now standing before [700 or so people], singing about the possibility of redemption,\" King describes the premiere.\n\n\"It was a movie-worthy moment far before the invention of film.\"\n\nThe Dublin premiere was met with rave reviews.\n\nProceeds were donated to the release of imprisoned debtors, a hospital and an infirmary.\n\nBut the oratorio's subsequent performances in London were not warmly received.\n\nHandel's decision to perform a sacred work in a theatre turned off many audiences from attending.\n\nMessiah lives on partly due to its association with philanthropic causes.\n\nFrom 1750, Handel offered performances of Messiah to raise funds for the Foundling Hospital, a children's home at the heart of London.\n\nFrom 1750, Messiah was performed annually at London's Foundling Hospital to raise funds. (Wikimedia Commons: British Museum)\n\nThe benefit concert became an annual event and cemented Messiah as \"music that was in aid of a good cause,\" King says.\n\nEven though Messiah began as an Easter-themed oratorio, the music became a Christmas tradition.\n\n\"By the 1830s and 1840s, people around the world were quite accustomed to hearing it at Christmas time,\" King says.\n\nOver the years, audiences have built their own traditions around the work.\n\nAn anecdote claimed King George II got to his feet during the famous Hallelujah Chorus at one of the London performances.\n\nAudiences today still stand during that section of Messiah.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhy Messiah still resonates with audiences today\n\nThere are relatively few pieces of music that have outlived their composers for as long as Handel's Messiah.\n\n\"This piece of music has been in near continuous performance since the time it was composed [nearly 300 years ago],\" King says.\n\nThe Music Show: Messiah Andrew Ford talks with author Charles King about how Handel's Messiah became a cornerstone of the musical canon.\n\nBoth Ford and King find the words of Messiah still quite resonant in the context of our present day.\n\n\"[Messiah] was created in a time of war, dissension, disease, ever-present death and real worry about the present state of the world,\" King says.\n\nThe vision of a better world makes the music timeless.\n\n\"Every performance of the Messiah begins with a promise: comfort ye, comfort ye my people,\" King says, referring to the first aria of the oratorio, which is taken from the biblical book of Isaiah.\n\nThis promise frames the story of Christmas and Easter, which are both present in the music.\n\nThe central question of Messiah, King says, is: \"How [do] you possibly have hope in a world in which all of the evidence of your senses would suggest otherwise?\"\n\n\" The first step in changing the world is to re-imagine the world in a radically new way. \"\n\nHence the famous line: \"Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain shall be made low.\"\n\nAlmost 300 years later, audiences still turn to that promise for comfort.\n\nSign up to the ABC Classic Newsletter",

        "text": "A row of unattended caravans parked along a popular free riverside campsite has sparked renewed debate about fair access to public camping spots during peak holiday periods.\n\nFootage, shared online by traveller Ciaran Shields and his partner through their account No Place To Go But Everywhere, shows caravans lined up along the Murray River on the New South Wales-Victoria border, with no sign of people staying at the site.\n\nMr Shields said the scene was unlike anything they had encountered during months of travelling around Australia in their converted bus.\n\nCiaran Shields is travelling around Australia with his young family. (Supplied: Ciaran Shields)\n\n\"The first time we came to that beach, we met a family camping there who told us about people parking their vans there for Christmas,\" he said.\n\n\"They said one of the guys had parked their van right in front of their tent, which we thought was a bit rude.\n\n\" There was just a row of vans parked up on the waterfront without anybody there. \"\n\nThe campsite, known as Davis Beach, on the Victorian side of the Murray River at Tocumwal, is a popular swimming and camping spot, particularly during school holidays.\n\nMr Shields said his family was not planning to camp there but visited the area last month so their children and dogs could swim.\n\nUnder Parks Victoria rules camping is allowed for up to six weeks at a time. (ABC News: Sarah Buchecker)\n\nThe video, which shows nine unattended caravans parked in what he described as \"prime spots\" along the Murray River, quickly gained traction online, drawing hundreds of thousands of views and hundreds of comments.\n\n\"We were absolutely blown away by the attention,\" Mr Shields said.\n\nThe footage triggered a flood of debate, with many accusing caravan owners of effectively \"reserving\" public campsites by leaving vehicles unattended for days or weeks at a time \u2014 behaviour widely viewed as inconsiderate, even if not always illegal.\n\nOthers defended the practice, arguing people should be free to come and go during extended holiday stays.\n\nA common problem\n\nThe stretch along the Murray River is managed by Parks Victoria, which said the practice was common at this time of year.\n\n\"The maximum time someone can camp at one of the Murray River Reserve sites, like Davis Beach, is six weeks,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"If people encounter issues with behaviour or facilities at one of our campsites, they can report them.\"\n\nThe issue is not just confined to camping.\n\nGoulburn-Murray Water (GMW), which manages recreational water storages across northern Victoria, warns reserving sections of public foreshore for exclusive use was not permitted.\n\n\"Our storages are fantastic places to visit but it is important that everyone plays their part to ensure they remain this way,\" GMW general manager of water storage services Jon McKeown said.\n\n\"During busy times we do see people looking to reserve inlets or parts of the foreshore for exclusive use by installing gazebos, inflatable pontoons and other structures before their visit.\n\n\" This is not permitted and isn't fair on others who want to enjoy the area. \"\n\nParks Victoria says campers reserving spots is a common problem. (ABC Mildura-Swan Hill: Sophie Malcolm)\n\nUnder the Water (Recreational Area) Regulations 2023, you can be fined for leaving temporary structures unattended on the foreshore.\n\nMr Shields said the behaviour was something his family had never encountered before.\n\n\"We used to live in the South West of WA and have been travelling around in our converted school bus since March 2024,\" he said.\n\n\"We have never seen anything like this on our travels before or around our home town in WA for that matter.\n\n\"But judging by the comments it happens here quite regularly for Christmas and Easter.\"",

The hallmark has generally been discretion. One wishes there were less of it and more glimpses of the real experience shining light upon the magic. Like Henry Duke of Gloucester, returning home after two years as the 11th governor-general, was asked by Queen Mary, \u201cHow was it out there?\u201d \u201cWretched, Mother, wretched.\u201d\n\nBiographies - even authorised ones \u2013 are more forthcoming, among the best Zelman Cowen\u2019s life of his hero, Isaac Isaacs (1993); and Philip Ayres\u2019 Fortunate Voyager (2013), a superb account of the life of Ninian Stephen. Now Juliet Rieden\u2019s biography of the 25th governor-general, Quentin Bryce, has joined the canon.\n\nBryce was the first female law faculty member at the University of Queensland; founding member of the National Women\u2019s Advisory Council; founding Director of the Queensland Women\u2019s Information Service; founding Chair and CEO of the National Childcare Accreditation Council; first female Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner (these latter two proved especially testing); second female Governor of Queensland; and first female governor-general.

        "text": "As Christmas creeps closer, so does the pressure on household budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause while Christmas time offers us days off in the sunshine and time with loved ones, it also can be an expensive time \u2014 especially if you're the one buying Christmas lunch for the family.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new survey of 1,002 Australians from Pureprofile found households will spend, on average, $506 on festive food this year \u2014 up from $406 in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same survey found 78 per cent of Australians plan on adjusting their spending this festive season, with 21 per cent planning to opt for more budget-friendly food and drink on Christmas Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how can you actually save on your Christmas food spread? We asked some experts.\n\n\n\nFresh isn't always better\n\nFresh produce is often treated as the gold standard at Christmas. But frozen alternatives can be just as good \u2014 and sometimes better \u2014 according to Professor Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology Business School, who specialises in consumer behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Frozen is a better quality because often when seafood is caught and particularly when prawns are caught, they're frozen immediately,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're pretty fresh when they're frozen. So when you thaw them out, it's actually just like they've been caught.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also a clear price advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You find that the frozen product tends to be cheaper than the fresh product. The same would go for frozen veg over fresh veg,\" Mortimer said.\n\n\n\nWhile it might be tempting to buy fresh prawns, Professor Gary Mortimer said frozen ones can be just as good \u2014 and cheaper. Source: Getty / sfe-co2 More Australians are making the switch to frozen, said Eden Radford, media spokesperson at financial comparison site Canstar Blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fourteen per cent of people are actually buying food before Christmas \u2014 before December \u2014 and putting it in the freezer to store for later,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Consumers are getting a lot smarter either by want or by necessity because they know that they're just going to need to save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Doing things like shopping around at multiple supermarkets, choosing frozen options ahead of fresh.\"\n\n\n\nLook for what's in 'bountiful supply'\n\nSome fresh produce will be more expensive this year simply because there's less of it available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of food tends to be fresh \u2014 fresh seafood, fresh fruit [often stone fruit] and those particular types of foods are highly susceptible to the supply and demand effect,\" Mortimer said.\n\n\n\nMortimer points to potatoes as one example: currently stripped from many supermarket shelves due to drought.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrawns and peaches, too, can swing in price depending on disease pressure or unpredictable growing conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis advice? Stay flexible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenge is looking at what's in bountiful supply, therefore the prices will be relatively low,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThis Christmas, you can expect cheaper basics across the board, with Choice finding the cost of seven items has dropped since the last quarter. Source: SBS News Data from consumer advocacy group Choice found that overall, the cost of a base basket of seven items \u2014 apples, carrots, bananas, strawberries, Weet-bix, milk and chicken breast fillets \u2014 had fallen across the four big supermarkets in the last quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe item that fell the most in price was strawberries, as expected for seasonal produce.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price of milk rose at all four supermarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest price reduction came at Woolworths, with the cost of a basket dropping by 16 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Aldi, it fell by 11 per cent, Coles by 6 per cent, and IGA by 4 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadford said more Australians are willing to be flexible on their grocery lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Seventeen per cent of people said they'll always buy the same [Christmas] food. They don't look at price,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That suggests that people are a lot more cost-conscious and are trying to find different ways to save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're willing to make a few changes. They're willing to swap some things out in order for them to save a little bit of money \u2026 it could be a different kind of meat or a smaller portion.\"\n\n\n\nBuy in bulk \u2014 then split it\n\nOne of the fastest-growing savings strategies is \"collaborative shopping\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A large family or a large group will get together \u2026 buy in bulk, and share it across two or three families,\" Mortimer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he's seen families buy half an animal carcass for around $600 and divide it between households. Others head to the markets , split a $400 fruit-and-veg haul, or buy an $80 ham from Costco and portion it out.\n\n\n\nRadford said thinking about portions can be an underrated saving tool.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore shopping, she encourages people to think about whether they actually need a full-sized ham or if a smaller cut would do \u2014 or whether buying a slightly larger item might be cheaper if leftovers will cover multiple meals.\n\n\n\nHome brand is now the quiet hero\n\nMortimer said the days of looking down on supermarket-owned brands are over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today, one in three products [in supermarkets] are a private label supermarket-owned brand,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're traditionally lower priced than the brand product and equal, if not better quality.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The simple shopping swap that could save you $4,000 a year\n\nMortimer said Christmas is when the quality difference becomes especially noticeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As we move into the Christmas period, we start to see the better quality popping up \u2014 the Woolworths Select, the Coles Finest. When it comes to Christmas fare, I'd be looking at those types of products when you have Christmas lunch or dinner,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadford said shoppers are getting more analytical: \"Australians aren't just going to take the price that's in front of them. They're going to look at the unit pricing and think if they can go somewhere else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And they're also opting to go for supermarket-branded items instead of buying the name brand,\" she said.\n\n\n\nShop across supermarkets\n\nChoice also compared the cost of your standard basket of groceries for entertaining \u2014 including items such as stuffed olives, Twisties, crackers, pretzels, cheese, and some fresh fruit and veg.\n\n\n\n\n\nAldi had the cheapest shop for party items, costing $41. Its base basket items were also the cheapest at $31.41.\n\n\n\nThe cost of your Christmas shop could differ significantly depending on which supermarket you go to, with Choice research finding Aldi is the cheapest place to go for your party shop. Source: SBS News The combined cost of an entertainment shop and your base basket items, without specials, at Woolworths came to $98.98.\n\n\n\n\n\nColes came in slightly higher at $100.04, while the same basket at IGA would cost you $109.25. Aldi's price was $72.41.\n\n\n\n\n\nAldi remains the consistently cheapest supermarket, Mortimer said, but its smaller range means many shoppers split their shop.\n\n\n\n\"What we are seeing with consumers and have seen for some time now is that they're willing to shop across multiple brands of supermarkets but also independent players to save money and get that choice,\" Mortimer said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You may shop at Aldi to get the basics, but you may go to the fruit market to get the lowest priced fruit and vegetables, then you might go to the big supermarkets to get the range you need to finish off Christmas lunch or dinner.\"\n\n\n\n",

Where, earlier this year, it was exporting more than a million barrels a day, exports are now down to less than 800,000 barrels and falling as tankers steer clear of its coast.\n\nThe impact of what analysts think could be the withdrawal of about 500,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan oil, as a result of the US chokehold, is less significant for the market and oil price than what\u2019s happening to Russia\u2019s exports. (Venezuelan oil represented only about one per cent of global supply even at its peak this year.)",

Most are good (or they don\u2019t last long); many are spectacular. What we can do is take a highly opinionated stance and steer you in the direction of spots we love. They\u2019re reliably delicious, memorable and so much fun. Go on, take a bite. Atomix The bar at Korean diner Atomix. Elevated, innovative Korean dining in Manhattan\n\nThe only restaurant in New York to make The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2025 (it came in at number 12), Atomix delivers innovative Korean fine dining at its most impressive. The 12-course tasting menu experience combines meticulous technique and surprising ingredients (kohlrabi and caviar; mussel and bluefin tuna with cheonggukjang) with exemplary service. Korean-born husband-and-wife team, Ellia and Junghyun \u2018JP\u2019 Park, welcome diners to an elegant, minimal space in the NoMad neighbourhood of Manhattan.\n\n104 East 30th Street, New York.

Alamy Stock Photo Arguably the best pizza in the city\n\nWhy name just one best pizza in New York when the city is full of outstanding slices and pies to devour? The square slices at Mama\u2019s Too are right up there, with toppings ranging from classic (pepperoni cups) to inventive (Cacio e Pepe) and inspired (poached pear, mozzarella, sweet gorgonzola and hot honey). The original location is on the Upper West Side, but the West Village restaurant has an advantage: It\u2019s a couple of hundred metres from L\u2019Industrie Pizzeria, another strong contender for the city\u2019s best pizza. Try them both and decide for yourself.\n\n323 Bleecker Street, New York. Phone: +1 212 510 7256. See mamastoo.com Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi Interiors at Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi.

Italian-inspired all-day cafe with excellent cocktails\n\nEstablished in 1915 as Caff\u00e9 Dante, this Greenwich Village gem has been under Aussie management since 2015 when hospo power couple Linden Pride and Nathalie Hudson took the reins. Go there for the best Negronis in the city (on tap, no less), afternoon spritz specials and seasonal cocktails. The Italian-ish brunch and all-day-until-late menu shows some green-and-gold influence, with housemade banana bread and avocado toast alongside more Continental antipasti, flatbreads and pasta.

The terrific food and service is worth the wait (and Michelin Bib Gourmand recognition) and the sceney bar takes walk-ins. Launched by former Gramercy Tavern alums, Rolo\u2019s sets the bar high with a menu of wood-fired specialties that starts with fluffy polenta bread and leads to deliciously charred lasagna and butter-smeared dry-aged steaks.

Be prepared to wait in line for the juicy, tender meat; don\u2019t arrive too late in the day or you might miss out. The sides are a meal in themselves, from pork-laced collard greens and tangy slaw to creamy mac-and-cheese. For dessert, the banana pudding gets rave reviews.\n\n454 Van Brunt Street, Brooklyn.

Why? The food is consistently terrific, from the signature Balthazar burger to veal Milanese, steak frites and roast chicken. A raw bar sends out magnificent seafood towers and a shrimp cocktail that never goes out of style, while the classic cocktails always satisfy. It\u2019s worth trying for a walk-in seat at the bar, where you could be rubbing shoulders with A-list celebrities, models and photographers from nearby Soho studios.

The hallmark has generally been discretion. One wishes there were less of it and more glimpses of the real experience shining light upon the magic.

        "text": "Families of politicians could be downgraded to economy class flights and stopped from claiming taxpayer-funded trips to major sporting events.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has moved to restrict family reunion travel entitlements for MPs following weeks of backlash around ministers charging the public purse to fly spouses to grand finals and private holidays.\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland paid back about $10,000 after charging taxpayers more than $20,000 for family travel to Perth for a week-long holiday in 2023 following ministerial engagements in the west.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"I received advice from the Independent Authority that a portion of that, for one use two and a half years ago was outside the guidelines,\" she told ABC radio on Tuesday.\n\n\"So, I sought advice on that and repaid that amount.\"\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland says she has repaid the one travel that fell outside the rules. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nSports Minister Anika Wells also came under fire for flying her husband to numerous grand finals and the Australian Open, as well as taking her family to the snow while claiming family reunion flights.\n\nMr Albanese wrote to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority seeking advice and had now written to the independent remuneration tribunal with recommendations for changes that advice was received.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe tribunal sets politicians wages and entitlements.\n\n\"It is appropriate that we have an arm's length process on these matters,\" Mr Albanese told reporters in Canberra.\n\nFamily travel should be downgraded from business class to economy, he said he recommended in his letter.\n\nFlights should also be restricted to between Canberra and the MP's local area, effectively removing access to nationwide entitlements, he said.\n\nThe prime minister's recommendations on travel entitlements follow public outrage over claims. (Bianca De Marchi/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nBut spouses or partners of senior office holders should be able to claim flights to events they are invited to that directly relate to a minister's portfolio or parliamentary duties, Mr Albanese recommended.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe prime minister also called for the tribunal take into account the circumstances of new mothers or fathers, or MPs with children who are dependents, to make sure parents aren't disadvantaged.\n\n\"We want a parliament that reflects Australia in all its diversity,\" he said.\n\n\"That includes the fact that this parliament looks very different from what it did when I came here in 1996 - that's a good thing.\"\n\nThe tribunal will consider the recommendations in early January.",
