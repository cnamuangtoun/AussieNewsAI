        "text": "By all outward appearances, The Survivors is just another clich\u00e9 of its genre.\n\nFast facts about The Survivors What: An Australian murder-mystery adapted from Jane Harper's bestselling novel. Directed by: Tony Ayres Starring: Charlie Vickers, Yerin Ha, Robyn Malcolm, Damien Garvey, Thom Green, Shannon Berry, Catherine McClements, Miriama Smith, Don Hany. When: On Netflix now Likely to make you feel: Gripped (and craving a holiday in Tassie).\n\nIn a small town full of buried secrets, everyone becomes a suspect when a young woman\u2019s body washes up on the beach.\n\nAs its director Tony Ayres explains, the show\u2019s very premise puts it at risk of \u201cthe worst version\u201d of murder mystery: \"Dead girl entertainment.\"\n\n\u201cOften, women being murdered feels more consequential as a story,\u201d he told The Screen Show\u2019s Jason di Rosso.\n\nFor him, the only way to approach this trope was to delve further.\n\n\"It\u2019s not as though women being murdered is not something that happens every week in Australia. It\u2019s not as though it\u2019s not a reality,\" he said.\n\n\"The best version of this [story] asks: why does this happen?\"\n\nIn his six-part series \u2014 adapted from the bestselling novel by Jane Harper and now released on Netflix \u2014 this question is explored in a uniquely Australian setting, as a town of \"good blokes\" and their women, \"true locals\" and outsiders are thrust under the spotlight.\n\nMemorial football games and forgotten women\n\nThe Survivors is set in the fictional Tasmanian tourist town of Evelyn Bay, where tight-knit locals are still mourning the two young men who died in a freak storm 15 years earlier.\n\nFinn and Toby were top blokes in a stereotypically Australian understanding of the term: they looked out for their mates; they loved a banter over a beer; and they were good at footy.\n\nBut Evelyn Bay has all but forgotten Gabby, the young girl who also went missing that day, and they dismiss her grieving mother as a hysterical nutcase.\n\nThe caves aren't the only thing holding secrets in Evelyn Bay. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nWhen Kieran Elliott (Charlie Vickers) returns to his hometown with his young baby in tow, he\u2019s constantly reminded by the town \u2013 and particularly by his mother \u2013 that those men, one of whom was his brother, drowned trying to save him.\n\nHis wife Mia (Yerin Ha) grew up as one of the only Asian-Australians in Evelyn Bay, and became even more of an outsider when her best friend Gabby went missing that day.\n\nAs Kieran and Mia endure their frosty homecoming, another woman is found washed up on the beach, and this time the town can\u2019t look away.\n\nMateship under pressure\n\nIt\u2019s easy for local crime to feel a little cliched, but The Survivors flows so naturally it almost feels like a true crime piece.\n\nFor Ayres, it was important to twist the \"dead girls\" narrative into a story that felt \"useful and reflective, that generates conversation, rather than [present it] in a way which is just kind of packaged\".\n\nBefore The Survivors, Tony Ayres was behind Glitch, Stateless, Clickbait and Nowhere Boys. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nAnd the women of The Survivors are far from victims. Both of the mystery girls feel like fully fledged characters, while the women who call Evelyn Bay home display determination and nuance throughout.\n\nParticularly impressive is Robyn Malcolm as Kieran\u2019s mum Verity, who\u2019s lost one son and blames another for his death. At once a terrifying force and earnestly vulnerable, she is deeply protective of her town, its conventions and the men who inhabit it.\n\nVerity\u2019s tense relationship with her daughter-in-law contrasts with her infatuation with her new granddaughter, and their classic dynamic is deepened by their cultural differences.\n\nRobyn Malcolm is a stand-out in The Survivors, driving the plot forward as mother, wife and protector. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\n\"As a child from an Asian background, you are never supposed to speak up against your elders,\" Ayres explains.\n\n\"So when Mia first enters the story, she is very polite \u2026 but you can see a steeliness underneath that.\"\n\nHer patience with her mother-in-law eventually dissolves into a \"rip roaring fight\" by episode four, which Ayres says was one of his personal highlights of the series.\n\nEvelyn Bay is a town that fiercely protects its own, but brutally excludes and intimidates those who don\u2019t quite fit in.\n\nLocals are quick to blame a backpacker from South America (no-one seems to quite know which country) for the recent murder, and a tree-changer from the mainland who isn\u2019t quite blokey enough (he wears a cardigan) is also viewed with distrust, his property vandalised.\n\nAyres says \"there's a version of Mia's role where she's a bit of a pushover\", but Yerin Ha's take on the character \"never is\". (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nWhile Ayres was cautious about \"banging the audience on the head\" with it, running through the show\u2019s core is an undercurrent of Australian mateship and masculinity gone wrong.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think you can make a TV series in 2025 where two young women die without in some way reflecting on the preconditions of why that happens,\" he says.\n\n\"And certainly it\u2019s a theme that\u2019s very resonant in Australian society: why do men commit so many acts of violence against women?\"\n\nThe impact of all this on men is explored too, as they bottle up their grief and emotion and replace it with anger, blame and violence.\n\nParticularly moving is the portrait of Kieran\u2019s father Brian (Damien Garvey). After a full life as \"a legend\" with the \"biggest pair of balls in the bay\", Brian\u2019s now beset with early onset dementia, and relies on his wife to be his carer.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThe Survivors is full of staggeringly beautiful shots of the Tasmanian coastline, tough-talking detectives and plenty of twists and turns.\n\nBut it's also a small-scale story of grief, growth, family and relationships, as the parents of Evelyn Bay begin to ask themselves: \"Were we wrong about our sons?\"\n\n\"Why did we make them squash all those lovely kind pieces of themselves, into something that we thought they should be,\" Verity wonders in the show's finale.\n\n\"What did we turn them into?\"",

(ABC News: Lillian Rangiah)\n\nA day later, the government announced the vilification clause would be replaced, rather than removed, in response to community feedback.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Attorney-General Marie-Clare Boothby said the revised wording would prohibit conduct that \"incites hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule\" based on a person's identity.\n\n\"The key reforms will remove unclear, vague terms introduced by Labor, such as 'offend' and 'insult' and replace them with clearer standard that focuses on real harm \u2014 consistent with frameworks already in place elsewhere in Australia,\" they said.\n\nMarie-Clare Boothby said the new bill was still being drafted. (ABC News: Chris Fitzpatrick)\n\nDuring senate estimates on Monday, NT Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Jeswynn Yogaratnam said while he had not seen a draft bill yet, he argued the vilification provisions should not be changed at all.\n\nHe said the current protections were the \"strongest we have here in Australia\".\n\n\"It's highly visionary in terms of where we're going with that reform,\" he said.\n\n\" Any other version of the vilification provision would be watering it down. \"\n\nProtesters marched through Darwin on Saturday with pride flags and signs advocating against the government's plans to walk back anti-discrimination laws. (ABC News: Lillian Rangiah)\n\nDuring estimates, Ms Boothby said the government was \"reigniting the flames of free speech\".\n\nShe argued the current wording allowed people to \"take legal action just because they found something offensive and drag you through a complaints process\".\n\nBut Mr Yogaratnam said that was not the case, because an objective legal test is applied to determine whether conduct can be considered offensive.\n\nJeswynn Yogaratnam says the CLP government's proposed changes to the Anti-Discrimination Act would be \"watering it down\". (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nHe said the commission had received 46 complaints under the new vilification provision since it came into effect in mid-2023, but only three had been accepted.\n\nTop End Pride committee member and emergency doctor, Bhushan Joshi, worries the new bill will make it easier to \"willingly or knowingly in public put someone down\" on the basis of their gender, sexuality or other attributes.\n\n\"I feel \u2026 they want to clarify to make it easier to offend, insult or humiliate other people,\" he said.\n\nThe government said it had consulted a range of community groups including LGBTQIA+ groups before changing its plans for the law, but Dr Joshi questioned the scope of that consultation.\n\nBhushan Joshi says the Anti-Discrimination Act is about creating a \"fairer and just society\". (ABC News: Lillian Rangiah)\n\nHe said Top End Pride had not directly been approached for consultation, but some members had provided feedback.\n\nDr Joshi said the Anti-Discrimination Act was a better way to deal with hate speech and vilification than the criminal system.\n\n\"This is more like a mediation process \u2014 the Anti-Discrimination Commission isn't out to 'get' you, it's out to make society a fairer and just society for everybody,\" he said.\n\n\" What they often do is actually bring both parties together, work out what happened and then get a result. \"\n\nCLP to 'restore' protections for religious schools\n\n'It's about rights': Religious leader welcomes discrimination law rollback Photo shows Charles Gauci 1 A controversial anti-hate speech measure introduced by the NT's previous Labor government is set to be scrapped by the Country Liberal Party.\n\nThe previous Labor government also banned religious schools from being able to only hire staff who shared the same faith, as part of its reforms to the act in late 2022.\n\nHowever the current government has remained committed to restoring that right for religious schools, despite opposition from LGBTQIA+ groups and the NT Anti-Discrimination Commission.\n\nMs Boothby told senate estimates the new laws would allow religious schools to prioritise hiring staff of the same faith, rather than exempting schools from discriminating against other job candidates altogether.\n\n\"We promised the community we would make these changes and we are now putting in place those protections because we absolutely believe in religious freedoms,\" she said.\n\nMr Yogaratnam said the changes were \"redundant\" as religious freedoms in the workplace were already protected under other parts of the legislation.\n\nWhen contacted by the ABC, the Australian Christian Lobby's (ACL) NT representative Nicholas Lay said he could not comment as he had not seen the draft bill.\n\nThe ACL supported the CLP's previous plan to scrap the vilification clause and reintroduce religious schools' rights to only hire staff of the same faith.\n\nChanges to the Anti-Discrimination Act are set to be introduced to parliament next month and debated by the year's end.",

        "text": "Queensland's 16th and newest captain, Cameron Munster, wants to apply the champion attributes of the great Cameron Smith to resurrect his side's State of Origin hopes.\n\nThe Maroons play NSW in Perth on Wednesday night in Game II of the Origin series as they aim for their first win in the Western Australian capital.\n\nThey played dumb football in the 18-6 loss to the Blues at Suncorp Stadium in Game I. The Maroons were ill-disciplined, defensively fragile and lacking in a clear attacking plan.\n\nSmith, who captained the Maroons to six series wins out of seven in a stellar career, was always a step ahead of NSW in planning and performance.\n\n'Won't beat them for another 100 years': Maroons legend's dire warning after Origin I flop Photo shows Kalyn Ponga stands alongside Cameron Munster Chris Close is predicting a bloodbath if Queensland replicates its performance from the series opener when State of Origin continues this week.\n\nMunster made his Origin debut under Smith and won two NRL titles (2017 and 2020) at Melbourne when the maestro was skipper.\n\nIt is why he deferred to the retired champion when asked what kind of captain he wanted to be after becoming the new skipper in the wake of the Maroons' third consecutive Origin loss.\n\n\"I couldn't go past Cameron Smith. He led in all the right directions,\" Munster said.\n\n\"There's a reason why he's played 42 games for Queensland and I don't think anyone's ever going to beat that record.\n\n\"It's pretty special and he's a lifetime kind of generational player.\n\n\"Everyone talks about X-factor. He didn't have the X-factor but he had the capacity to be able to break teams down with his mind and his smarts.\n\n\" You don't really get those blokes in rugby league anymore. \"\n\nThe \"smarts\" Munster referred to, so typical of a Smith display, were missing in game one as the Maroons gave away penalties early, missed key tackles and did not have an attacking plan or structure to break down their opponents.\n\nCoach Billy Slater has made changes and elevated Melbourne forward Trent Loiero to the starting side after he came off the bench in Game I.\n\nLoiero has been guilty at the Storm of ill-discipline, as he was in the Magic Round loss to Canberra when giving away late penalties.\n\nTouted as an \"enforcer\", he said the Maroons must play with Smith-like smarts.\n\n\"It's a physical game. You need to be physical, but by the same token, it's not all argy-bargy,\" Loiero said.\n\nTrent Loiero will be a starter for the Maroons in Origin II after coming off the bench in the series opener. (Getty Images: Bradley Kanaris)\n\n\"You've got to be able to play with a bit of brains, and we didn't do that last game. We played a bit silly, made a few dumb mistakes and gave away a few stupid penalties. That ended up hurting us, and we've done our review and we'll be righting our wrongs.\"\n\nThat sentiment would be music to Smith's ears, so long as the Maroons follow through.\n\n\"We did our review and [Slater] was pretty stern, as he should be. We were stern with each other,\" Loiero said.\n\n\"There were a few hard conversations, as there should be after a hard loss. We've learned our lessons and we'll be looking to move forward in Game II.\n\n\"To play this game, everyone's got to have that aggression. You have to be tough to play rugby league so it's in all of us.\n\n\"But I think you've got to use it in the right way. As a team, we've got to use it in the right way together. We'll get the best out of each other if we do it together.\"\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: Sonia Ford)\n\nThe Queensland-designed BB18 1/4 (one quarter) class locomotive, numbered 1037, was one of the last steam trains to ever run on the state's network, retiring in March 1970 in Mackay.\n\nAfter sitting in a suburban park for 30 years, the train was donated to MHR, with early newsletters detailing plans to have it running by 2000.\n\nHaving incorporated in 1995, Mackay Heritage Railway originally aimed to be on the rails within a decade. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nA frustrated dream\n\nThe 1037 was moved to a siding at Mackay Harbour, with a shed built around it.\n\nA scrapbook compiled by the Fords show the project received grant funding support from the federal government.\n\nThe 1037 locomotive had sat in a park in Mackay for 30 years, and required significant work. (Supplied: Sonia Ford)\n\nMs Ford said the project became like a second full-time job for Peter and many group members.\n\n\"If he wasn't here, it was doing trips away, looking for parts or getting information,\" she said.\n\nBut as the years went on, Ms Ford said there was \"a lot of frustration\" about the length of the job.\n\n\"A lot of guys got very angry, but it's just something we couldn't control,\" she said.\n\nMackay Heritage Railway operations manager Brett Williams said while some volunteers turned up and offered to do basic tasks, few could contribute financially.\n\n\"The reality with the group, with all heritage groups, is money and people,\" he said.\n\nAnd few had the expertise to re-engineer a steam engine.\n\n\"There was a certain section of the boiler that wasted away, but for the most part, all the major fundamental components are still original purely because of cost involved,\" Mr Williams said.\n\nVolunteers in Mackay, including Mr Ford (top right), worked on the 1037 locomotive for more than 20 years. (Supplied: Sonia Ford)\n\nAfter nearly two decades, the Port of Mackay asked the group to relocate, and in 2019, the move began to a site near the city's main railway station in Paget, about 10 kilometres away.\n\nAround that time many of the group's original members, including Peter Ford, died.\n\nWith higher overheads at the new yard, and with dwindling expertise, Mr Williams was concerned the group would end up with debts it could not pay.\n\n\"We'd end up having to more or less scrap the equipment to cover those costs,\" he said.\n\n\"We didn't want to do that.\"\n\nOn the rails\n\nThe loco 1037 being lifted into workshops at DownsSteam, as a man pretends to hold it up.

(Supplied: Andrew Caldwell)\n\n\"There was still a fair bit of boiler work that had to be done. A lot of tedious pipe work and fittings and alignments,\" Mr Caldwell said.\n\nWithin 18 months, it was ready to run on the main line.\n\nMs Ford and her family were invited for the first running of the locomotive, newly christened \"Peter Ford\", in July last year.\n\n\"It was a very emotional time,\" she said.\n\n\"It was just a dream that I saw, a dream that Peter had. It was running. It was being used.\"\n\nSonia Ford says her husband Peter's dream was to have steam train trips running from Mackay. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nFor Mr Caldwell, paying tribute to Mr Ford's legacy on Queensland railways was an important part of the final restoration.\n\n\"He was instrumental in heritage rail operations and he had a huge depth of knowledge,\" he said.\n\nMr Williams said he too had an opportunity to ride the train and has encouraged other former MHR volunteers to do the same.\n\n\"There's a little bit of bitterness obviously, because so much work and effort was done by the Mackay team to get it where it's at,\" he said.\n\n\" There's no resentment because what those guys did with it is phenomenal. \"\n\nThe 1037 locomotive and DownsSteam's C16-106 are running tourist trips across the Darling Downs.

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nTraditional owner Raelene Cooper said Mr Watt had promised to give her three business days' notice before making a decision, which could allow her to seek an injunction, further delaying his decision.\n\nIf ultimately granted, those approvals would allow Woodside to go through the separate process of getting approvals to extract gas from the Browse Basin, one of the country's largest untapped resources.\n\nWhile Woodside and both levels of government see those plans as a boost to the WA economy and jobs, climate activists have long argued against the project and what its emissions will mean for a world trying to reach net zero by 2050.\n\n'Fundamental omission'\n\nFriends of Australian Rock Art co-convenor Judith Hugo said the application was brought because of concerns about the impact of emissions linked to the project on the world's climate, and on rock art at Murujuga.\n\nThose petroglyphs are approximately 40,000 years old and are being closely studied to assess whether or not nearby industry, including the North West Shelf, is impacting on their condition.\n\nTraditional owners to keep fighting North West Shelf extension Photo shows A rock carving of an lizard on red rocks Traditional owners have pledged to continue fighting the decision to extend the North West Shelf gas plant, as environmentalists shift their focus to Woodside's next major project.\n\n\"The North West Shelf Extension will cause pollution equal to 12 coal-fired power stations every year until 2070, however the vast majority of these emissions were ignored by the WA Minister in approving the proposal,\" Ms Hugo said in a statement, referring to scope three emissions.\n\n\"Our case aims to require the government to rectify this fundamental omission, so that the impacts of Woodside's carbon pollution can be understood.\n\n\"We have consistently raised concerns regarding sea level rise, increased wildfires, extreme heat and flooding and coastal erosion on the heritage landscape.\n\n\"We have also raised concerns about the ongoing use and enjoyment of this landscape by custodians practising cultural traditions, and by researchers and visitors in a heating climate.\n\n\" None of these impacts were assessed or considered by the [environment minister]. \"\n\nThe extension granted to Woodside's North West Shelf project has been controversial. (ABC News: Lauren Smith)\n\nA spokesperson for current WA Environment Minister Matthew Swinbourn said as the matter was before the courts, it was inappropriate for him to comment.\n\nA Woodside spokesperson said the company was aware of the case.\n\n\"We have confidence in the robustness of the state government's comprehensive approval process,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nLast week Woodside said it recognised the importance of the Commonwealth's proposed environmental approval conditions, \"including cultural heritage management and air quality\".\n\nScope three emissions 'impossible' to account for\n\nTom Hatton, who chaired WA's Environmental Protection Authority between 2014 and 2020, said he never saw it as the agency's role to regulate scope three emissions.\n\n\"For exported gas, those scope three emissions happen in jurisdictions outside of Australia, so it was never considered something that the state government, on advice from the EPA, would ever feel that they should condition, or put any conditions, on,\" he said.\n\nDr Tom Hatton does not believe it is feasible to account for scope three emissions in the analysis of a project. (ABC News: Jake Carmody)\n\nWhile Dr Hatton said it \"remains to be seen\" whether scope one or two emissions, produced directly by projects, were best regulated by state or federal governments, he remained firm on his view on scope three even after leaving the regulator.\n\nWoodside approval paves the way for the mother of all climate battles Photo shows Woodside future - North Rankin When all the hype and the fury are stripped away, the decision to extend the life of the gigantic North West Shelf LNG plant boils down to one thing \u2014 enabling the Browse gas project off the Kimberley coast.\n\n\"It would be so impossible, I think, for Australia to account for the scope three emissions for any of its exports, whether it's gas or anything else,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be a confusing international analysis, international arrangement, for Australia to do that.\"\n\nCurtin University sustainability professor and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report author Peter Newman said addressing global warming needed to be seen as a partnership.\n\n\"This process of being serious about climate change is not just a matter of who's really responsible for this and who's not, it is a matter of fixing it,\" he said.\n\nCurtin University Professor Peter Newman says action needs to be taken now on tackling climate change. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd)\n\n\"And we have to get serious about fixing it otherwise we're not going to solve this problem and the temperatures are going to get so bad that all of our economies are going to struggle and so many millions of people will be dying from it.\n\n\"Some part of government needs to take hold of that and run with it and the EPA is as good a place as any.\"",

(Supplied: Ain Raadik)\n\nLurick Sowden manages Yagurli Tours, one of the first entirely Indigenous-run tourism businesses in the Gulf.\n\nWhile top tourist rankings are subjective, Mr Sowden said visiting global pilots equate Burketown to one of the most scenic hot air balloon destinations in the world after Switzerland and Japan.\n\n\"We take them out onto Australia's largest aggregate of salt pan, which everyone drives past. They might not even know it's here,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very, very special.\"\n\nWeathering the storm\n\nIt has not been all clear blue skies for the tourism operation.\n\nMr Sowden said there had been \"two standard years\" since the business opened in 2016.\n\nThe rest were littered with struggle.\n\nSunrises, like this one captured during a trial balloon flight, would be a major tourist drawcard. (Supplied: Murrandoo Yanner)\n\nIn early 2023 the Gulf endured its largest flood in a decade, isolating the region for more than three months before ex-tropical cyclone Kirrily barrelled through less than 12 months later with further flooding.\n\n\"At the moment the roads are all open, Burketown is accessible,\" Mr Sowden said.\n\n\" Prior to that, the last few years, have not been so great. \"\n\nThe rare morning glory cloud is a specific type of roll cloud that appears in the Burketown area. (Supplied: Mike Zupanc)\n\nOutback Queensland is a road-heavy tourist area \u2014 rail lines are virtually non-existent, and expensive flights are few and far between.\n\nAs the regions rely on visiting grey nomads and caravan travellers alike, having accessible and open roads is key for tourism to flourish.\n\n\"We're kind of back on track for just a normal year. Everything's kind of settled down and we're ready to go,\" Mr Sowden said.\n\nYagurli Tours co-founder and community leader Murrandoo Yanner looks out from a hot air balloon over Burketown. (Supplied: Murrandoo Yanner)\n\nWith almost 100 more visitors than last year, Mr Sowden hopes 2025 is the year things are turned around.\n\n\"We should be in for a big year and a lot more people travelling around,\" he said.\n\nWide open roads\n\nIt is not just this pocket of Queensland feeling the pinch.\n\nOutback Queensland Tourism Association (OQTA) chief executive Denise Brown said the domestic tourist season had been slow off the mark across the state in 2025, with regional and rural regions bearing the brunt.\n\nIn the OQTA's most recent annual report, operators reported the slowest start to the tourism season in four years with numbers down by 20 to 30 per cent compared to 2023.\n\nYagurli Tours is an Indigenous-owned business operated by the Gangalidda and Garawa Peoples in Burketown. (Facebook: Yagurli Tours)\n\nBut it is not all doom and gloom.\n\nWhile recent devastating western Queensland floods stopped travellers heading north in their tracks, roads have begun to reopen.\n\nIn tandem, visitor numbers across May and June have picked up.\n\n\"Certainly, our challenges are always to have access, and our number one access is roads,\" Ms Brown said.\n\n\" A number of people [across Australia] are really keen to get to the tip, and when those roads start to open up and it's safe to travel they come up the inland highway or through the back country. \"\n\nDenise Brown says roads in outback Queensland are essential for tourism. (Supplied: Denise Brown)\n\nMs Brown said OQTA was working alongside tourism advocates and governments to show the country why they should trek to the outback.\n\n\"The areas that we're focusing on is the colours of the beautiful landscapes, the green rolling carpet and the bird life,\" she said.\n\nWhile weather events might have washed away some of the country, Ms Brown said outback residents were as resilient as the landscapes and wanted to showcase their part of the world.\n\n\"Indigenous tourism is really important to the whole of Queensland and that's certainly a pillar,\" she said.\n\n\"Out of disaster comes amazing opportunities, the rebirthing of nature.\n\n\"That is the opportunity to see the outback as you'll never see in the next 10 years.\"",

To do so would be a clear and deliberate breach of faith.\"\n\nBut journos be journo-ing, so based on the documents plastered in the newspaper they do go on to explain their position.\n\n\"We will advance a proposal in response to the Commission initiated proceedings that would make it easier for employers and employees to adopt working from home arrangements that suit their circumstances. The potential development of such a term is the purpose of the proceedings. \"We have previously identified a range of ways in which the award is operating as a barrier to employers agreeing to reasonable working from home arrangements. The reality is that in many respects the award is completely out of step with the realities of both current working practices and the desired level of flexibility that many employees want in order to help them balance their work and personal commitments. It was written at a time that assumed that employees were, by and large, still working from their employer\u2019s office or premises and has failed to evolve to reflect the seismic shift in employee working practices and preferences that have evolved since the pandemic. \"It must also be recalled that the reason these issues came to the Commission\u2019s attention was the conduct of a review of modern awards recently undertaken by the Commission at the request of the former Workplace Relations Minister, Tony Bourke. The union\u2019s ridiculous attempt to demonise industry efforts to assist the Commission to develop a term that it has indicated should potentially be inserted into awards, and to characterise them as a \u2018dummy spit\u2019, is frankly bizarre and predictably unproductive. \"The last election demonstrated the importance people place on working from home. We know that accommodating this, when they can, is also important to many employers. Sadly, some in the union movement seem determined to cling to the notoriously complex web of outdated workplace laws that work against the interests of workers, instead of constructively and cooperatively exploring how regulation of working arrangements can be genuinely modernised in way that is both fair and flexible for all parties.\"\n\nMore to come.",

(Supplied: Bridget Lockley)\n\nMs Lockley said bikes for those without adaptive needs were typically about $25 at the store.\n\n\"I went through lots of different emotions. I was angry, but then also a bit sad,\" she said.\n\nOne of Ms Lockley's daughters has a rare gene change causing multiple diagnoses.\n\nShe said her daughter requires a lot of different equipment, listing a walking frame, adapted bike, specialised seating, self-care equipment, standing frame, change table, shower equipment and a high-low bed as some of the items needed.\n\nWhile she said navigating the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) could be \"stressful\", it had helped her family overcome barriers by covering expenses and providing essential supports.\n\nThe Lockley family don't want their daughter Rosie to feel her needs are 'less valued' than other children. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nPrior to the NDIS, equipment could be accessed locally through TasEquip's loan system, but this changed when the NDIS began and took over government disability funding.\n\nMs Lockley felt things were easier with TasEquip, saying they often deal with lengthy processes involving a range of trials, assessments and reports.\n\nHer friend, Lauren Miller, agreed, saying it took nearly two years to receive a powered wheelchair for her daughter, and while she began the application process in advance \u2014 it still became \"urgent\" as her daughter grew out of her existing wheelchair.\n\nMs Lockley said stores like the tip shop could help fill a role \u2014 especially for those families currently going without the support of the NDIS.\n\nBut she is worried the pricing of specialist items as if they were \"luxury goods\" is sending the wrong message to the community.\n\nIf her own daughter saw the $500 price tag of the bike, Ms Lockley said \"it could make her feel like her needs are less valued than her sisters'\".\n\nLauren Miller says her family waited nearly two years for a powered wheelchair, during which her daughter grew out of her current one. (ABC News: Madeleine Rojahn)\n\nMs Miller and Ms Lockley are among parents who also disagree with supports usually covered by the NDIS being onsold without proper understanding of the items.\n\n\"Pricing them so highly puts them completely out of reach for the very families who rely on community resources like [the tip] shop to bridge critical gaps in access and funding.\"\n\n\"These are not luxury goods. They are vital supports funded by the NDIS that help disabled children participate in daily life with comfort, dignity and inclusion,\" she said.\n\nThe family is among those wanting an attitude-shift to non-disability-specific stores selling equipment for adaptive needs. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nTip-shop makes change\n\nMs Lockley wrote to the tip shop to voice her concerns and said a positive outcome followed.\n\nBelinda Hazel, from Hobart's Mornington Park Waste Transfer Station, which was selling the bike and high-low chair, said \"it certainly wasn't intentional\" and her team had gone through normal pricing processes but were unaware of the extra considerations for disability equipment.\n\n\"When we get different types of items in, we do research to see what those items may be priced on the second-hand market,\" Ms Hazel said.\n\n\" So I can understand somebody who might be in the disability sector or understands how much those items are new and through an NDIS pathway \u2014 that they may feel aggrieved about that. \"\n\nParents say the bike was not fairly priced and sent a disheartening message to families and children. (Supplied: Bridget Lockley)\n\nMs Hazel said she contacted a local disability service provider and ended up donating the equipment, saying this would be the process from now.\n\nThe provider would also assess the item for safety and quality.\n\n\"If we ever get an item like that coming in, we'll reach out to that service provider and have them come up [to the store], and if it's something that a client could use, then they will take that item.\n\n\"And if it's something that they're not able to use, then they will work with us to price that accordingly to what they think would be meeting a client's expectations.\"\n\nFor Ms Lockley, it's a welcome outcome.\n\n\"It shows a growing understanding and compassion around the value of these items and the importance of treating them with dignity,\" she said.\n\nSpecialised items allow children to participate in general life.

Suddenly, the pressure rose and Fearnley broke. Bolt battled hard to lead 15-0 and 30-15 but could not force a break-back point and the British number two served out.\n\nEarlier on Monday, O'Connell, who had been beaten by Bolt in the second round of qualifying on Sunday, found himself facing fourth seed Holger Rune as a lucky loser.\n\nGiven less than 3 hours' notice after Matteo Arnaldi withdrew with an ankle injury, O'Connell began well, forcing a break opportunity in the third game.\n\nHe failed to take it, however, and the Dane, playing his first game of the year on grass, then settled.\n\nO'Connell was still very much in the game when serving at 3-4, but within the blink of an eye the first set was gone 6-3.\n\nRune, currently ranked ninth in the world, broke again midway through the second set and took it 6-4.\n\nBritish wildcard veteran Dan Evans, now 35 and ranked a lowly 199, delighted a crowd basking in unusually hot London sunshine with a boilover 7-5, 6-2 victory against seventh seed Frances Tiafoe.\n\nBut British number three Cameron Norrie, a former finalist, lost to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik 7-6 (8-6), 1-6, 6-1.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Seeded five, he faces Jiri Lehecka.\n\nThe Czech, ranked 30, is a potentially tricky opponent. De Minaur, who slipped to 12 in the rankings updated yesterday, having not defended his title at Rosmalen last week, won their previous meeting, indoors in the 2023 Davis Cup, but Lehecka KO'd two top-20 players on grass on his last Wimbledon visit, in 2023.\n\nAt the same time on court 5, Alexei Popyrin, now ranked at a career-high 21, plays Aleksandar Vukic in an all-Aussie affair while Jordan Thompson goes later against Jaume Munar.\n\nIn Nottingham, James McCabe, having come through qualifying, faced British wildcard George Loffhagen in a repeat of their final at the same venue on the lowest-tier world tennis tour last year.\n\nMcCabe won that one 6-0, 6-1 and it was the same result at Challenger level, albeit much closer, as the Australian won 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).\n\nAAP",

The Sinclairs spend their summers on their private island near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where Harris (David Morse) and his wife Tipper (Wendy Crewson) live in the main mansion, and have built slightly less ostentatious mansions for their three daughters, Carrie (Meryl Streep\u2019s daughter Mamie Gummer), Penny (Caitlin FitzGerald) and Bess (Candice King).\n\nSo Amazon Prime Video\u2019s eight-part adaptation is hotly anticipated, even by the millions who know the secret at the story\u2019s heart.\n\nWhen E. Lockhart\u2019s YA novel We Were Liars was published in 2014, it was huge, spending 40 weeks on the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list. Then, in 2021, the twisty novel had an unexpected surge in sales (now about 3 million copies) when it trended on BookTok , with readers sharing themselves becoming emotional over the book\u2019s ending.\n\nThe \u201cliars\u201d of the title are the children of the daughters \u2013 cousins Cadence (Emily Alyn Lind), troublemaker Johnny (Australian Joseph Zada, who has just been cast in the new Hunger Games movie) and the misunderstood Mirren (Esther McGregor, daughter of actor Ewan) \u2013 and Gat (Shubham Maheshwari), whose uncle Ed (Rahul Kohli), is partnered with Johnny\u2019s mum, and who is the only person, staff aside, who isn\u2019t blond-haired and blue-eyed.

They\u2019re also growing increasingly aware of the Sinclair family dysfunction; a Sinclair, Cadence is often told, does not show grief or sadness. There are certain expectations for such American \u201croyalty\u201d. Then there are the bizarre family traditions, in which Harris is referred to as The King, with special menus and co-ordinated clothing that are designed to foster competitiveness.\n\nThe series opens with Cadence telling us in voiceover that \u201csomething terrible happened last summer, and I have no memory of what, or who hurt me\u201d. While we are shown much of the summer before this incident as flashback, we also see Cadence in the present-day living with a brain injury and a trauma-induced amnesia (best not to fact-check the frequent medical explanations), desperate to remember.",

        "text": "\u201cAnd I see it every day at training. I\u2019m the one he makes look bad when we run left [edge] against right [edge] drills. It gets very old, very quickly trying to pick Critta\u2019s defence apart, he\u2019s just so good.\u201d As Crichton slowly, patiently explains the nuances of his craft, you get some sense of just how he pulls off grand final winning intercepts, leads a defensive revolution at Canterbury and marks two elite Origin opponents at once. All while giving away very little, which must be how opposition playmakers feel, even when they seemingly hold all the cards with one-man advantage. The enemy: A different cue for every player The best NRL ball players will bluff defenders with eye contact \u2013 locking eyes with an opponent or darting their own one way and passing another. They\u2019ll do it with body language, dummying and squaring hips and shoulders to hold a defensive line at bay, or drawing them into an ill-timed rush.\n\nCrichton, in response, keeps his powder dry. Not least with a recorder under his nose. \u201cOh no, no I can\u2019t tell you that, man,\u201d the Bulldogs skipper laughs. \u201cBut to be honest, it\u2019s a little bit of everything, and mostly, a lot of extra work in terms of knowing the players you\u2019re up against. There\u2019s no set piece or single bit of body language or cue that I look for, because every player\u2019s different, right? \u201cKalyn Ponga is such a different threat to Daly Cherry-Evans. You can\u2019t defend them the same way.\n\n\u201cIf you try to defend things the same way every time, you\u2019re pre-empting it and offering the attack the chance to pick you apart. I guess being predictable goes both ways.\u201d The genetics and grounding: 360 degrees and dinner plate hands Crichton\u2019s rare athleticism \u2013 he stands at 193cm and weighs 99kg \u2013 plays a significant, imposing role in defence. Physically, he can go toe-to-toe with anyone in the game. The 24-year-old\u2019s first coach at Penrith, Ben Harden, encouraged Crichton\u2019s juggling of AFL (he trialled with GWS Giants), basketball (again, he trialled for the Australian schoolboys side) and rugby league as a teen.\n\nThe grounding in 360-degree games undoubtedly helped build the spatial awareness Crichton prizes highly. \u201cKnowing what\u2019s happening around each player, how much room they have to move, that spatial awareness is really important and something you can learn,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big focus for me at training \u2013 knowing what\u2019s going on around me. It\u2019s something Ciro [Canterbury coach Cameron Ciraldo] drills home as well.\u201d Burton adds: \u201cDon\u2019t forget those big lanky arms and dinner plate hands. \u201cHe\u2019s got an extra foot on other defenders that you have to think about when you\u2019re passing.\u201d\n\nThe decisions: Hold \u2019em, fold \u2019em Zeroing in on the 10 minutes of Origin I when Crichton held the Blues right wing on his own, his ability to make the right call stood plain as day. Just as it has countless times already for first Penrith, NSW and now Canterbury. Ciraldo\u2019s defensive systems at both clubs have been founded on having options A, B and C to respond to attacking shapes and curveballs \u2013 be it a line break, dropped ball or missed tackle. Crichton defends like he has these responses written down his arm. And invariably, makes the right call on which defence to deploy.\n\n\u201cI try and see the play coming from as far out as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you can rush in and stop an attacking play before it gets too dangerous, then you do. \u201cBut it takes a lot of trust and understanding of what the defenders either side of you are going to do as well. And that doesn\u2019t mean you always react as soon as you see a play. \u201cYou might wait until the right time to make your move, too \u2013 it could be right up until the play rolls out, and then you\u2019re sliding and using the sideline as an extra defender or holding up until your teammates get there to help\u201d.\n\nQueensland\u2019s two best attacking opportunities against the 12-man Blues went in such fashion. With Zac Lomax noting \u201cNathan Cleary, Liam Martin and Stephen Crichton have defended alongside each other forever\u201d, Crichton\u2019s faith in Cleary had him back-pedalling when Ponga and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow came calling in the 54th minute. Rather than rushing in to shut down play, Cleary is trusted to handle Tabuai-Fidow as time and space dwindle while Crichton covers winger Valentine Holmes as well. When a similar shape unfolds a moment later from a Maroons scrum, Crichton is this time up and forcing a mistimed pass from Cameron Munster. Holmes is then held up as he tries to find the turf, and six NSW teammates end up playing stacks on as the veteran flyer is shoved into touch.\n\nQueensland \u2013 with a one-man advantage but their attack severely out-of-sorts \u2013 don\u2019t come calling again. The intercepts: A false economy\n\n\n\nCrichton has previously pinpointed a one-on-one trouncing he copped from one-time teammate Waqa Blake in 2020 as the turning point for his defensive focus. With video rolling of Blake swatting Crichton away, he and Ciraldo identified there and then what it would take to make him the game\u2019s best defensive centre.\n\nThe same process was behind the 2021 grand final intercept that will keep Cody Walker awake at night for as long as it is remembered. \u201cPeople remember the intercepts and think of me as \u2018the intercept guy\u2019,\u201d Crichton says. \u201cBut to me, you can\u2019t really defend thinking \u2018intercept\u2019. That brings you undone. Intercepts happen in a rush and are really a bit of [an] all or nothing gamble. And if you defend that way looking for it, you\u2019re going to get nothing most of the time. \u201cYou go looking for the intercept, you\u2019re telegraphing and showing what you\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s when they skin ya. You\u2019ve shown your cards too early.",

There are no bustling bars or buzzy restaurants, save a few nearby cafes.\n\nOnce a bustling auto-alley, the Princes Highway at Rockdale has fallen victim to the \u201curban decay\u201d befalling many of Sydney\u2019s ageing arterial roads.\n\nBut there is hope for Sydney\u2019s boulevards of broken dreams, with an influx of new housing developments putting pressure on our city\u2019s planning thinkers to come up with fresh projects to pedestrianise and beautify our sprawling roads.\n\nSome of Sydney\u2019s biggest eyesores and traffic choke points were once grand boulevards, enjoyed by Sydneysiders as retail destinations. Now many of these main roads drive people away \u2013 to smaller suburban cafe clusters or pedestrianised promenades.\n\nWould you enjoy an al fresco dinner by Parramatta Road? How about sitting and reading while enjoying a coffee beside the Princes Highway?\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nShe\u2019d like to see more events and nighttime activations in Rockdale, similar to Lakemba\u2019s night markets, to get the community excited to stay in town.\n\nLily Wu says foot traffic has gotten so quiet she could go a full day without a single person stepping inside her furniture store.\n\n\u201cIt affected us a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been less customers since the post office closed.\u201d\n\nButcher Cindy Phan has noticed a decrease in foot traffic on the Princes Highway in Rockdale. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nCindy Phan has run the local butchers with her husband Anthony for 15 years. They work next to a row of empty shops.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing to hold people here,\u201d Jennifer Dean, a resident of 20 years, says.\n\nIt\u2019s a road you drive through to get somewhere else, but for Rockdale locals, this is supposed to be their high street.\n\nCommittee for Sydney\u2019s Eamon Waterford says his solution is simple. Reduce the lanes of traffic, build a bike lane, tear down the metal fence that divides the town down the middle of the highway, and plant more street trees.\n\nWhile construction of the M6 tunnel project has been plagued by major challenges and delays after two sinkholes opened up during tunnelling , its eventual opening could be the perfect moment to revamp the Princes Highway.\n\nRows of empty shops are divided by a metal fence on the Princes Highway. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\n\u201cWe need a vibrant town centre that locals can enjoy \u2013 at the moment it\u2019s basically a commuter suburb; if you want to enjoy an outdoor area you are probably travelling somewhere else in our LGA or further afield.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Princes Highway at Rockdale has been the victim of urban decay like so many main roads. It\u2019s sad to see the number of businesses that have closed down replaced by empty shopfronts,\u201d he says.\n\nBayside Council Mayor Ed McDougall wants to see the road transformed. The council is working on a masterplan to rejuvenate the town centre.\n\nThis stretch of Parramatta Road near Leichhardt is littered with crumbling empty buildings. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nParramatta Road has been given every negative label under the sun. Anyone who has had the displeasure of driving, not to mention walking, down Sydney\u2019s original boulevard knows its biggest problem. It\u2019s ugly.\n\nThe scar through Sydney. Beirut on a bad day. The boulevard of broken dreams.\n\n\u201cIt means there\u2019s an opportunity for us to reclaim the Princes Highway along this corridor as a place for people, as a high street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to learn from our mistakes; we have 2\u00bd years until the M6 opens in late 2028 to get ready. We missed an opportunity with Parramatta Road when WestConnex opened in 2019 to re-balance the place and movement considerations of Parramatta Road,\u201d he says.\n\nCustomer-facing businesses struggle to survive with grim foot traffic. Streetside dining here is unthinkable.\n\nYou only need to walk down the road for 10 minutes to find shop after shop left empty and decaying. Once grand buildings look mouldy and crumbling. Weed-infested parcels of land have become havens for rubbish dumping.\n\nNaomi Cooper says cycling and walking down Parramatta Road is too dangerous. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nCars and noisy buses fly past, exhaust fills the nostrils and heat blasts from the concrete with little to no landscaping for reprieve.\n\nNow a walk down Parramatta Road on a warm summer day feels like a challenge to overcome.\n\nIn the late 1800s horses and carts dotted from village to village, and retail trade boomed on the link between Parramatta and the city.\n\n\u201cYou mean this hellscape,\u201d Leichhardt local Naomi Cooper says. \u201cNobody is doing their errands here.\u201d\n\nVarious councils and state governments have come up with plans to fix the roads with little success.\n\nThe Parramatta Road Corridor Urban Transformation Strategy (PRCUTS) was developed in 2016 and identified precincts on and around the road for increased housing density, improved active transport and urban beautification.\n\nThe recent Transport Oriented Development rezoning in Homebush will help this vision get off the ground, as will the Inner West Council\u2019s recent proposal for increased density across the council area, but key parts of the PRCUTS have yet to materialise.\n\nDespite a 2016-2023 implementation plan that outlines several areas for short-term transformation, Leichhardt\u2019s Taverners Hill precinct remains virtually unchanged with no bike lane and no new housing development.\n\nWhile big picture plans, including suggestions to decrease lanes of traffic and build a light rail down the road, haven\u2019t gained any real traction, the impending arrival of several housing developments along Parramatta Road means new residents are coming fast, and no doubt they\u2019ll be wanting a nicer neighbourhood.\n\nMore than 500 homes will be built at the old WestConnex dive site in Camperdown, 1100 apartments would be built under the Kings Bay Village proposal in Five Dock, and Burwood Council\u2019s Burwood North Masterplan would have more than 7000 additional homes built adjacent to Parramatta Road.\n\nRicky Choi runs a barber shop on the Petersham stretch, nearby Crystal Street where a proposed co-living development would bring seven storeys of new potential customers. She\u2019s confident an influx of residents will put pressure on the council to make the area more viable for businesses.\n\n\u201cPeople want to do more things in their local area. I think the more apartments come in, the more businesses will too,\u201d she says.\n\nRicky Choi of Miss Chop Barber says there is virtually no foot traffic outside her Parramatta Road shop. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nEamon Waterford believes lane reduction and a major public transport overhaul is the only way to reclaim Parramatta Road for the people.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is something big and grand that declares to Sydneysiders \u2026 that this road is now a Boulevard, is now a high street for people, for place, not movement,\u201d he says.\n\nSydney Olympic Park\n\nOn game day, Olympic Boulevard is booming. It\u2019s almost impossible to see past the crowd of sports jerseys, as people stream out of the train station to walk down the 60-metre-wide street towards Accor Stadium and Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney Olympic Park.\n\nBut the next day, the road is a ghost town.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet outside of game day because there isn\u2019t a lot of things that can be activated down there at the moment,\u201d says Allison Taylor, chief executive of the business association in the area.\n\nOlympic Boulevard is a ghost town on non-event days. Credit: Wolter Peeters\n\n\u201cThe southern end of the boulevard is basically sporting venues and they\u2019re just big buildings with no activation opportunity onto the actual Olympic Boulevard.\u201d\n\nSynonymous with sports and events, Olympic Boulevard, along with the rest of Sydney Olympic Park, has been routinely subjected to bold visions from the state government and the Sydney Olympic Park Authority over the past 25 years. Despite that, the key road remains virtually the same.\n\nThere\u2019s been the Master Plan 2002, Vision 2025 and Master Plan 2030. Last year, the authority announced Master Plan 2030 would be replaced with Master Plan 2050.\n\nThe new plan reveals the precinct\u2019s hopes to transition away from being known as just a place for sports and events to a \u201cthriving urban community\u201d.\n\nAn artist impression of Sydney Olympic Park in the Master Plan 2050.\n\nIn 25 years, Olympic Boulevard, between Dawn Fraser Avenue and Figtree Drive, is proposed to become a \u201cgreen, active transport corridor\u201d featuring public open space, plazas, an extensive tree canopy and a new cultural centre. Towers of up to 55 storeys would be built along the boulevard and pave the way for more opportunities for eateries and bars, with the stretch of the road alongside Accor Stadium and Cathy Freeman Park to become car-free.\n\nBusiness Western Sydney executive director David Borger, who also sits on the Sydney Olympic Park Authority board, has high hopes the 2050 plan will finally be the one that breathes new life into Olympic Boulevard.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Boulevard was designed to be big enough that you could march an army through it, but unfortunately the army only turns up on game days in the stadiums and the rest of the time it can feel empty,\u201d he says.\n\nOxford Street\n\nOxford Street is in the midst of its transformation. Local business owners say it can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nThe delayed Oxford and Foley development is set to open later this year, and with it the hoarding that has blighted the city-side of the strip for years.\n\nArtist impression of the Oxford and Foley development. Credit: TOGA\n\nLocal favourite bar and restaurant Big Poppas, known as the best place on the strip for late-night food and hip-hop music, has closed temporarily during the construction work.\n\nJust a stone\u2019s throw away, popular western-inspired bar Shady Pines Saloon, run by the embattled Swillhouse hospitality group, has closed as part of another redevelopment bringing Sydney\u2019s first Soho House \u2013 an exclusive members-only club where membership is likely to cost north of $4000 a year.\n\nThe new developments are set to bring new retail offerings and office spaces, but the local LGBTQ community has concerns that a shiny new building won\u2019t bring back the soul of the strip.\n\n\u201cI worry it will be of a level that ordinary people won\u2019t be able to access or enjoy, and more than that, feel a part of,\u201d Noel Lee, of the Bookshop Darlinghurst says.\n\nNoel Lee of the Bookshop Darlinghurst fears Oxford Street could lose its LGBT community with new developments. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nLee has worked at the shop for more than 20 years, and has seen the area become run down, even as Darlinghurst and Paddington became gentrified. A row of shops near Taylor Square sits empty and run down.\n\nThe former bank building, which once housed the T2 nightclub at Taylor Square, is awaiting redevelopment, but for years sat empty after a council plan to use it as a bike hub were abandoned.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cYou feel sorry \u2013 we get customers coming in all the time as an LGBT speciality store international tourists will pop in and say they were here 25 years ago, and talk about how great it was especially in the \u201990s,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd then they\u2019ll just say: what\u2019s happened to the street?\u201d\n\nDespite the decline, Lee says he sees green shoots popping up.\n\nSimon Fowler opened his cafe, Simon Says, six years ago on the corner of Oxford Street and South Dowling Street. Nearby, a luxury hotel development at the old Odeon Theatre is set to open later this year with new restaurants.\n\n\u201cAfter living overseas for a number of years, you see how advanced, cosmopolitan, culturally rich cities treat their spaces. This in particular, this space, it\u2019s got so much potential,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not another convenience store selling vapes, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mark Stephenson was diagnosed with Young Onset Lewy Body Dementia a year after also being diagnosed with Parkinson disease, his 32-year career as a professional firefighter came to an abrupt end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's what the doctor told me was, unfortunately, you won't be able to do your job anymore and you can't drive home. My full professional career on the fire trucks, plus training and all that stopped in an instant. Plus my love was riding motorbikes as well, so that stopped in the instance as well. So that was a bit difficult to deal with as far as your world, which was big, became very small.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLewy Body Dementia is a brain disorder that can lead to problems with thinking, movement, behaviour and mood.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a progressive illness, meaning it worsens over time, and common symptoms can include visual hallucinations, memory problems, sleep disorders and declining muscle strength and mobility.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Stephenson, who was in his mid-50s when he was diagnosed, says the loss of his career left him feeling directionless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I made endless phone calls to charities or to people who feed the homeless or to do some form of sport and was knocked back at every occasion. And that was more hard to cope with than the initial loss, I think, because then it was like, okay, I can't volunteer anywhere because I'm too big a risk. And when you keep getting doors closed in your face after the first big loss, and it was like, oh, what do I do? And then I just basically gave up on trying.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mr Stephenson stumbled across a Facebook post from an organisation called Sporting Wheelies encouraging people with disability to get involved in sport, he initially feared he'd once again be rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a gentle push from his wife, he decided to give wheelchair cricket a try.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" So, I went down and tried with cricket and yeah, it was very, after having so much rejection, it was very weird to walk into a place. It was very accepting. And then to look around and realise that there was people with all different abilities and disabilities. They were all there playing sport. And once you hopped in the chair, no one really saw the chair. You were just people playing sport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 1 in 5 Australians have disability - which accounts for around 5.5 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\nSporting Wheelies Chief Operating Officer, Dane Cross says only a relatively small number of people with disability currently play sport, despite most having an interest in becoming involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"25 per cent of people with disability currently participate in sports, so one in four. But what we also know is three in four or 75 per cent want to participate, but so there's a gap there in I guess the sporting environment is that people want to play but currently face barriers and are unable to play.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the cost of adaptive equipment like wheelchairs and other supports can be prohibitive, and many clubs and community sports organisations aren't well equipped to make sports accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we do know is that there aren't currently enough opportunities for people with disability to be participating in sport. Currently, the sporting environment is not entirely inclusive and so mainstream sports are not that suitable for all people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording the Mr Cross it's not just physical barriers that dissuade people with disability from becoming involved in sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's actually a gap in the attitudes and the stereotypes that exist in the space where people with disability aren't necessarily seen as athletes. And so attitudes, community attitudes, community sports club attitudes are required to change, to adapt, to enable more people to participate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSport4All is another organisation working to shift public perception around disability and sport, and facilitate more inclusive environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation works with community sport clubs and schools to provide support, training and practical tools to make sport more welcoming.\n\n\n\n\n\nSport4All National Manager Carl Partridge says a significant part of his organisation's work is tackling a lack of understanding around the many forms disability can take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got to remember that only a relatively small proportion of people have a disability that you can see. But it comes into things like financial limitations, community attitudes, many programs are designed, aren't really designed with inclusion in minds so people are unintentionally excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Partridge says more programs are needed to bridge the gap that currently exists between people with disability who want to participate in sport, and those who are currently involved in sports.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says through making sports more welcoming, programs like Sport4All and Sporting Wheelies are showing just how diverse the benefits of sport can be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, I think the benefits are so much more than just the physical health benefits. I think people think about sports physically, but for people with disability, there's other layers to as well. It's a gateway to social connection. It builds confidence, independence, but it also builds that massive sense of belonging.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2019 study by Paralympics Australia found one in four people with disability identify social interaction as one of the top two benefits of getting involved in sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is true for Mr Stephenson, who is now involved in cricket, AFL and basketball through Sporting Wheelies.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2025 federal election campaign, opposition health spokeswoman Anne Ruston had this to say during a debate with Health Minister Mark Butler at the National Press Club in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia's health system has long been the envy of the world. It's a system grounded in the firm belief that no matter who you are or where you live, you will get access to affordability, quality health care and at the heart of that system is Medicare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while that might be the dream, multiple reports have found that's not always the reality - which is perhaps why health care was one of the defining features of the campaign for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd why the focus of the public debate has been on GPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We regard \u2013 in the Labor Party \u2013 Medicare as being the heart and indeed the soul of our health system. We believe that people should be able to see a doctor for free.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a new report from the Grattan Institute has put the spotlight on specialist doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Baldwin is one of the co-authors of the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" These are referred medical care, the kind of thing you need a referral from your GP for. And after patients get that referral and need that specialised health care they're faced with a really tough choice in our system at the moment. Either they go and make an appointment with a private specialist and then they might be hit with some pretty high fees. Only a third of appointments are bulk billed... So either they cough up in the private sector or they queue up in the public sector. And those wait times for a free public appointment can be months, sometimes even years long.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's no niche issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand for primary care and specialist services has grown, as Health Minister Mark Butler has acknowledged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" We've got a growing population that's getting older with more complex chronic disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout four in 10 Australians visited a specialist in the 2023-24 financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage out-of-pocket costs for extreme-fee-charging specialists in 2023 for example reached $671 for psychiatry services and more than $350 for endocrinology, cardiology, paediatrics, immunology and neurology services.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Baldwin says about two-thirds of appointments across all specialties are private ones, with patients receiving a Medicare rebate and paying a gap fee that can be substantial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"About one in five Australians who see a specialist are hit with what we're calling an extreme fee at least once a year. They're only charged by about four percent of specialists - so they're real outliers - and they're fees that are more than triple the Medicare schedule fee. So that's the amount that the government tips in for every single visit. And those extreme fees can be hundreds of dollars for a single consultation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese figures are born out by GPs like Dr Nindhi Ahilan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When patients attend they don't really often talk about the cost of seeing the GP as much as they talk about the cost of going on to see a specialist... Sometimes that means a delay in care... But some women are just avoiding care altogether.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Medical Association president Dr Danielle McMullen was not available for an interview to respond to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the AMA said in a statement that the report validates what they have been saying all along about the need for greater public hospital funding - and how the current Medicare rebates are still not enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The report highlights the urgent need for reforms to ensure Medicare rebates keep pace with the rising costs of delivering timely, high-quality healthcare to all Australians... Private outpatient services alleviate pressure on the broader health system, and ongoing support for this sector... is vital to maintaining choice, affordability, and sustainability.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grattan Institute's findings follow similar reports from Private Health Australia and the Commonwealth Bank's patient insights survey on costs for specialist care.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth documents found that patients in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Queensland are being hit with the highest out-of-pocket fees for private medical care in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Baldwin says these high costs have a negative impact on patients, potentially leading to missed diagnoses, avoidable pain and added pressure on hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says strong action is needed - including the funding of a million extra specialist appointment services every year in areas that receive the least care, more money for specialist training in rural areas, and a kind of naming and shaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government should do the maths on how much the specialist has charged on average across all of their consultations, and those that are reaching that threshold of triple or more for their Medicare scheduled fee should have that Medicare funding withdrawn. We don't think that the federal government should be implicitly subsidising these really extreme fees for patients.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMA says that's an extreme and unnecessary response.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It centres on the obscenely wealthy Sinclair family, the head of which, Harris, is a Murdoch-style media mogul with very \u201ctraditional\u201d (read: sexist, racist) American values. The Sinclairs spend their summers on their private island near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where Harris (David Morse) and his wife Tipper (Wendy Crewson) live in the main mansion, and have built slightly less ostentatious mansions for their three daughters, Carrie (Meryl Streep\u2019s daughter Mamie Gummer), Penny (Caitlin FitzGerald) and Bess (Candice King).\n\nSo Amazon Prime Video\u2019s eight-part adaptation is hotly anticipated, even by the millions who know the secret at the story\u2019s heart.\n\nWhen E. Lockhart\u2019s YA novel We Were Liars was published in 2014, it was huge, spending 40 weeks on the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list. Then, in 2021, the twisty novel had an unexpected surge in sales (now about 3 million copies) when it trended on BookTok , with readers sharing themselves becoming emotional over the book\u2019s ending.\n\nThe \u201cliars\u201d of the title are the children of the daughters \u2013 cousins Cadence (Emily Alyn Lind), troublemaker Johnny (Australian Joseph Zada, who has just been cast in the new Hunger Games movie) and the misunderstood Mirren (Esther McGregor, daughter of actor Ewan) \u2013 and Gat (Shubham Maheshwari), whose uncle Ed (Rahul Kohli), is partnered with Johnny\u2019s mum, and who is the only person, staff aside, who isn\u2019t blond-haired and blue-eyed. The quartet spends blissful summers on the island (along with Mirren\u2019s twin sisters and Johnny\u2019s younger brother, collectively known as \u201cthe littles\u201d), before everything changes.\n\nThe outrageously wealthy Sinclair family on their private island, dressed for the annual \u201clemon hunt\u201d in co-ordinated attire.\n\nBut even during the summer before that, the liars, by that time all about 17, have come to realise that private islands, a staff of dozens, including a tennis coach and someone whose sole job is delivering lobsters, is not representative of most people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re also growing increasingly aware of the Sinclair family dysfunction; a Sinclair, Cadence is often told, does not show grief or sadness. There are certain expectations for such American \u201croyalty\u201d. Then there are the bizarre family traditions, in which Harris is referred to as The King, with special menus and co-ordinated clothing that are designed to foster competitiveness.\n\nThe series opens with Cadence telling us in voiceover that \u201csomething terrible happened last summer, and I have no memory of what, or who hurt me\u201d. While we are shown much of the summer before this incident as flashback, we also see Cadence in the present-day living with a brain injury and a trauma-induced amnesia (best not to fact-check the frequent medical explanations), desperate to remember.",

        "text": "\u201cAnd I see it every day at training. I\u2019m the one he makes look bad when we run left [edge] against right [edge] drills. It gets very old, very quickly trying to pick Critta\u2019s defence apart, he\u2019s just so good.\u201d As Crichton slowly, patiently explains the nuances of his craft, you get some sense of just how he pulls off grand final winning intercepts, leads a defensive revolution at Canterbury and marks two elite Origin opponents at once. All while giving away very little, which must be how opposition playmakers feel, even when they seemingly hold all the cards with one-man advantage. The enemy: A different cue for every player The best NRL ball players will bluff defenders with eye contact \u2013 locking eyes with an opponent or darting their own one way and passing another. They\u2019ll do it with body language, dummying and squaring hips and shoulders to hold a defensive line at bay, or drawing them into an ill-timed rush.\n\nCrichton, in response, keeps his powder dry. Not least with a recorder under his nose. \u201cOh no, no I can\u2019t tell you that, man,\u201d the Bulldogs skipper laughs. \u201cBut to be honest, it\u2019s a little bit of everything, and mostly, a lot of extra work in terms of knowing the players you\u2019re up against. There\u2019s no set piece or single bit of body language or cue that I look for, because every player\u2019s different, right? \u201cKalyn Ponga is such a different threat to Daly Cherry-Evans. You can\u2019t defend them the same way.\n\n\u201cIf you try to defend things the same way every time, you\u2019re pre-empting it and offering the attack the chance to pick you apart. I guess being predictable goes both ways.\u201d The genetics and grounding: 360 degrees and dinner plate hands Crichton\u2019s rare athleticism \u2013 he stands at 193cm and weighs 99kg \u2013 plays a significant, imposing role in defence. Physically, he can go toe-to-toe with anyone in the game. The 24-year-old\u2019s first coach at Penrith, Ben Harden, encouraged Crichton\u2019s juggling of AFL (he trialled with GWS Giants), basketball (again, he trialled for the Australian schoolboys side) and rugby league as a teen.\n\nThe grounding in 360-degree games undoubtedly helped build the spatial awareness Crichton prizes highly. \u201cKnowing what\u2019s happening around each player, how much room they have to move, that spatial awareness is really important and something you can learn,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big focus for me at training \u2013 knowing what\u2019s going on around me. It\u2019s something Ciro [Canterbury coach Cameron Ciraldo] drills home as well.\u201d Burton adds: \u201cDon\u2019t forget those big lanky arms and dinner plate hands. \u201cHe\u2019s got an extra foot on other defenders that you have to think about when you\u2019re passing.\u201d\n\nThe decisions: Hold \u2019em, fold \u2019em Zeroing in on the 10 minutes of Origin I when Crichton held the Blues right wing on his own, his ability to make the right call stood plain as day. Just as it has countless times already for first Penrith, NSW and now Canterbury. Ciraldo\u2019s defensive systems at both clubs have been founded on having options A, B and C to respond to attacking shapes and curveballs \u2013 be it a line break, dropped ball or missed tackle. Crichton defends like he has these responses written down his arm. And invariably, makes the right call on which defence to deploy.\n\n\u201cI try and see the play coming from as far out as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you can rush in and stop an attacking play before it gets too dangerous, then you do. \u201cBut it takes a lot of trust and understanding of what the defenders either side of you are going to do as well. And that doesn\u2019t mean you always react as soon as you see a play. \u201cYou might wait until the right time to make your move, too \u2013 it could be right up until the play rolls out, and then you\u2019re sliding and using the sideline as an extra defender or holding up until your teammates get there to help\u201d.\n\nQueensland\u2019s two best attacking opportunities against the 12-man Blues went in such fashion. With Zac Lomax noting \u201cNathan Cleary, Liam Martin and Stephen Crichton have defended alongside each other forever\u201d, Crichton\u2019s faith in Cleary had him back-pedalling when Ponga and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow came calling in the 54th minute. Rather than rushing in to shut down play, Cleary is trusted to handle Tabuai-Fidow as time and space dwindle while Crichton covers winger Valentine Holmes as well. When a similar shape unfolds a moment later from a Maroons scrum, Crichton is this time up and forcing a mistimed pass from Cameron Munster. Holmes is then held up as he tries to find the turf, and six NSW teammates end up playing stacks on as the veteran flyer is shoved into touch.\n\nQueensland \u2013 with a one-man advantage but their attack severely out-of-sorts \u2013 don\u2019t come calling again. The intercepts: A false economy\n\n\n\nCrichton has previously pinpointed a one-on-one trouncing he copped from one-time teammate Waqa Blake in 2020 as the turning point for his defensive focus. With video rolling of Blake swatting Crichton away, he and Ciraldo identified there and then what it would take to make him the game\u2019s best defensive centre.\n\nThe same process was behind the 2021 grand final intercept that will keep Cody Walker awake at night for as long as it is remembered. \u201cPeople remember the intercepts and think of me as \u2018the intercept guy\u2019,\u201d Crichton says. \u201cBut to me, you can\u2019t really defend thinking \u2018intercept\u2019. That brings you undone. Intercepts happen in a rush and are really a bit of [an] all or nothing gamble. And if you defend that way looking for it, you\u2019re going to get nothing most of the time. \u201cYou go looking for the intercept, you\u2019re telegraphing and showing what you\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s when they skin ya. You\u2019ve shown your cards too early.",

        "text": "Shops have been shuttered and fallen into disrepair. The local post office closed in 2024. There are no bustling bars or buzzy restaurants, save a few nearby cafes.\n\nOnce a bustling auto-alley, the Princes Highway at Rockdale has fallen victim to the \u201curban decay\u201d befalling many of Sydney\u2019s ageing arterial roads.\n\nBut there is hope for Sydney\u2019s boulevards of broken dreams, with an influx of new housing developments putting pressure on our city\u2019s planning thinkers to come up with fresh projects to pedestrianise and beautify our sprawling roads.\n\nSome of Sydney\u2019s biggest eyesores and traffic choke points were once grand boulevards, enjoyed by Sydneysiders as retail destinations. Now many of these main roads drive people away \u2013 to smaller suburban cafe clusters or pedestrianised promenades.\n\nWould you enjoy an al fresco dinner by Parramatta Road? How about sitting and reading while enjoying a coffee beside the Princes Highway?\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nShe\u2019d like to see more events and nighttime activations in Rockdale, similar to Lakemba\u2019s night markets, to get the community excited to stay in town.\n\nLily Wu says foot traffic has gotten so quiet she could go a full day without a single person stepping inside her furniture store.\n\n\u201cIt affected us a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been less customers since the post office closed.\u201d\n\nButcher Cindy Phan has noticed a decrease in foot traffic on the Princes Highway in Rockdale. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nCindy Phan has run the local butchers with her husband Anthony for 15 years. They work next to a row of empty shops.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing to hold people here,\u201d Jennifer Dean, a resident of 20 years, says.\n\nIt\u2019s a road you drive through to get somewhere else, but for Rockdale locals, this is supposed to be their high street.\n\nCommittee for Sydney\u2019s Eamon Waterford says his solution is simple. Reduce the lanes of traffic, build a bike lane, tear down the metal fence that divides the town down the middle of the highway, and plant more street trees.\n\nWhile construction of the M6 tunnel project has been plagued by major challenges and delays after two sinkholes opened up during tunnelling , its eventual opening could be the perfect moment to revamp the Princes Highway.\n\nRows of empty shops are divided by a metal fence on the Princes Highway. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\n\u201cWe need a vibrant town centre that locals can enjoy \u2013 at the moment it\u2019s basically a commuter suburb; if you want to enjoy an outdoor area you are probably travelling somewhere else in our LGA or further afield.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Princes Highway at Rockdale has been the victim of urban decay like so many main roads. It\u2019s sad to see the number of businesses that have closed down replaced by empty shopfronts,\u201d he says.\n\nBayside Council Mayor Ed McDougall wants to see the road transformed. The council is working on a masterplan to rejuvenate the town centre.\n\nThis stretch of Parramatta Road near Leichhardt is littered with crumbling empty buildings. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nParramatta Road has been given every negative label under the sun. Anyone who has had the displeasure of driving, not to mention walking, down Sydney\u2019s original boulevard knows its biggest problem. It\u2019s ugly.\n\nThe scar through Sydney. Beirut on a bad day. The boulevard of broken dreams.\n\n\u201cIt means there\u2019s an opportunity for us to reclaim the Princes Highway along this corridor as a place for people, as a high street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to learn from our mistakes; we have 2\u00bd years until the M6 opens in late 2028 to get ready. We missed an opportunity with Parramatta Road when WestConnex opened in 2019 to re-balance the place and movement considerations of Parramatta Road,\u201d he says.\n\nCustomer-facing businesses struggle to survive with grim foot traffic. Streetside dining here is unthinkable.\n\nYou only need to walk down the road for 10 minutes to find shop after shop left empty and decaying. Once grand buildings look mouldy and crumbling. Weed-infested parcels of land have become havens for rubbish dumping.\n\nNaomi Cooper says cycling and walking down Parramatta Road is too dangerous. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nCars and noisy buses fly past, exhaust fills the nostrils and heat blasts from the concrete with little to no landscaping for reprieve.\n\nNow a walk down Parramatta Road on a warm summer day feels like a challenge to overcome.\n\nIn the late 1800s horses and carts dotted from village to village, and retail trade boomed on the link between Parramatta and the city.\n\n\u201cYou mean this hellscape,\u201d Leichhardt local Naomi Cooper says. \u201cNobody is doing their errands here.\u201d\n\nVarious councils and state governments have come up with plans to fix the roads with little success.\n\nThe Parramatta Road Corridor Urban Transformation Strategy (PRCUTS) was developed in 2016 and identified precincts on and around the road for increased housing density, improved active transport and urban beautification.\n\nThe recent Transport Oriented Development rezoning in Homebush will help this vision get off the ground, as will the Inner West Council\u2019s recent proposal for increased density across the council area, but key parts of the PRCUTS have yet to materialise.\n\nDespite a 2016-2023 implementation plan that outlines several areas for short-term transformation, Leichhardt\u2019s Taverners Hill precinct remains virtually unchanged with no bike lane and no new housing development.\n\nWhile big picture plans, including suggestions to decrease lanes of traffic and build a light rail down the road, haven\u2019t gained any real traction, the impending arrival of several housing developments along Parramatta Road means new residents are coming fast, and no doubt they\u2019ll be wanting a nicer neighbourhood.\n\nMore than 500 homes will be built at the old WestConnex dive site in Camperdown, 1100 apartments would be built under the Kings Bay Village proposal in Five Dock, and Burwood Council\u2019s Burwood North Masterplan would have more than 7000 additional homes built adjacent to Parramatta Road.\n\nRicky Choi runs a barber shop on the Petersham stretch, nearby Crystal Street where a proposed co-living development would bring seven storeys of new potential customers. She\u2019s confident an influx of residents will put pressure on the council to make the area more viable for businesses.\n\n\u201cPeople want to do more things in their local area. I think the more apartments come in, the more businesses will too,\u201d she says.\n\nRicky Choi of Miss Chop Barber says there is virtually no foot traffic outside her Parramatta Road shop. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nEamon Waterford believes lane reduction and a major public transport overhaul is the only way to reclaim Parramatta Road for the people.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is something big and grand that declares to Sydneysiders \u2026 that this road is now a Boulevard, is now a high street for people, for place, not movement,\u201d he says.\n\nSydney Olympic Park\n\nOn game day, Olympic Boulevard is booming. It\u2019s almost impossible to see past the crowd of sports jerseys, as people stream out of the train station to walk down the 60-metre-wide street towards Accor Stadium and Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney Olympic Park.\n\nBut the next day, the road is a ghost town.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet outside of game day because there isn\u2019t a lot of things that can be activated down there at the moment,\u201d says Allison Taylor, chief executive of the business association in the area.\n\nOlympic Boulevard is a ghost town on non-event days. Credit: Wolter Peeters\n\n\u201cThe southern end of the boulevard is basically sporting venues and they\u2019re just big buildings with no activation opportunity onto the actual Olympic Boulevard.\u201d\n\nSynonymous with sports and events, Olympic Boulevard, along with the rest of Sydney Olympic Park, has been routinely subjected to bold visions from the state government and the Sydney Olympic Park Authority over the past 25 years. Despite that, the key road remains virtually the same.\n\nThere\u2019s been the Master Plan 2002, Vision 2025 and Master Plan 2030. Last year, the authority announced Master Plan 2030 would be replaced with Master Plan 2050.\n\nThe new plan reveals the precinct\u2019s hopes to transition away from being known as just a place for sports and events to a \u201cthriving urban community\u201d.\n\nAn artist impression of Sydney Olympic Park in the Master Plan 2050.\n\nIn 25 years, Olympic Boulevard, between Dawn Fraser Avenue and Figtree Drive, is proposed to become a \u201cgreen, active transport corridor\u201d featuring public open space, plazas, an extensive tree canopy and a new cultural centre. Towers of up to 55 storeys would be built along the boulevard and pave the way for more opportunities for eateries and bars, with the stretch of the road alongside Accor Stadium and Cathy Freeman Park to become car-free.\n\nBusiness Western Sydney executive director David Borger, who also sits on the Sydney Olympic Park Authority board, has high hopes the 2050 plan will finally be the one that breathes new life into Olympic Boulevard.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Boulevard was designed to be big enough that you could march an army through it, but unfortunately the army only turns up on game days in the stadiums and the rest of the time it can feel empty,\u201d he says.\n\nOxford Street\n\nOxford Street is in the midst of its transformation. Local business owners say it can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nThe delayed Oxford and Foley development is set to open later this year, and with it the hoarding that has blighted the city-side of the strip for years.\n\nArtist impression of the Oxford and Foley development. Credit: TOGA\n\nLocal favourite bar and restaurant Big Poppas, known as the best place on the strip for late-night food and hip-hop music, has closed temporarily during the construction work.\n\nJust a stone\u2019s throw away, popular western-inspired bar Shady Pines Saloon, run by the embattled Swillhouse hospitality group, has closed as part of another redevelopment bringing Sydney\u2019s first Soho House \u2013 an exclusive members-only club where membership is likely to cost north of $4000 a year.\n\nThe new developments are set to bring new retail offerings and office spaces, but the local LGBTQ community has concerns that a shiny new building won\u2019t bring back the soul of the strip.\n\n\u201cI worry it will be of a level that ordinary people won\u2019t be able to access or enjoy, and more than that, feel a part of,\u201d Noel Lee, of the Bookshop Darlinghurst says.\n\nNoel Lee of the Bookshop Darlinghurst fears Oxford Street could lose its LGBT community with new developments. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nLee has worked at the shop for more than 20 years, and has seen the area become run down, even as Darlinghurst and Paddington became gentrified. A row of shops near Taylor Square sits empty and run down.\n\nThe former bank building, which once housed the T2 nightclub at Taylor Square, is awaiting redevelopment, but for years sat empty after a council plan to use it as a bike hub were abandoned.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cYou feel sorry \u2013 we get customers coming in all the time as an LGBT speciality store international tourists will pop in and say they were here 25 years ago, and talk about how great it was especially in the \u201990s,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd then they\u2019ll just say: what\u2019s happened to the street?\u201d\n\nDespite the decline, Lee says he sees green shoots popping up.\n\nSimon Fowler opened his cafe, Simon Says, six years ago on the corner of Oxford Street and South Dowling Street. Nearby, a luxury hotel development at the old Odeon Theatre is set to open later this year with new restaurants.\n\n\u201cAfter living overseas for a number of years, you see how advanced, cosmopolitan, culturally rich cities treat their spaces. This in particular, this space, it\u2019s got so much potential,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not another convenience store selling vapes, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Source: GoFundMe\n\nAussies are fuming after a farmer recently copped a $398 fine for moving two bales of hay across a road to a help out his drought-stricken neighbour. Graham Thomson, a hay contractor based in Condah, in Victoria\u2019s extremely dry southwest, was lugging the sheep feed on his tractor forks when a National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NHVR) officer\u2019s flashing lights brought him to a halt.\n\nThe long-time local said he had checked there were no other vehicles in sight before he travelled the 600 metres down the road, and across the Henty Highway. However, Mr Thomson said the officer informed him he wasn\u2019t allowed to haul anything on the front-end loader on a public road, and issued him the hefty fine for \u201cnot restraining\u201d the hay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m meant to have a load binder over them. I\u2019ve been farming for about 50 years and I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d he told Sheep Central, adding the officer said he would need to place the hay on a truck to transport it on the road.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, but one minute he says I can\u2019t carry anything on the road and then he books me for carrying something on it that\u2019s not restrained. So that didn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe incident \u2014 which reportedly occurred the same day a mental health event for farmers was held at the Condah Hotel \u2014 has infuriated others, with another local farmer Andy Satchell slamming the decision online.\n\nA video uploaded to his Facebook shows a large bale of hay balancing on the front of Mr Thomson\u2019s tractor. Yahoo News understands the clip not does depict the tractor at the time of the interception.\n\nThommo said the NHVR officer told him he would need to load the hay onto a truck to transport it on the road. Source: Facebook/Andy Satchell\n\n\u201cTo say Thommo was upset would be an understatement,\u201d Mr Satchell wrote. \u201cSurely farmers have a right to keep their livestock fed.\u201d\n\nThe clip has since gone viral, with thousands of Aussie sharing their frustration over the \u201cridiculous\u201d fine.\n\n\u201cEvery farmer is breaking the law as soon as they put a round roll or a square bale on those forks to go across a road,\u201d Mr Thomson told Sheep Central. \u201cThe fine was worth more than the value of the hay.\u201d\n\nFarmer vows to fight $398 fine\n\nA GoFundMe page set up on Mr Thomson's behalf is raising money to help him fight the fine in court.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThommo is choosing to contest the fine in court because he believes that, after 60+ years in the industry, helping a neighbour feed their livestock shouldn\u2019t be penalised,\u201d the fundraiser reads.\n\nAnother aim of the fight is to make sure the voices of famers are heard, the page says. Mr Thomson has requested all excess funds be donated to the National Centre for Farmer Health.\n\n\u201cDue to farmers experiencing environmental factors, such as drought and floods, I\u2019d like any excess funds to go to farmer mental health, as we need to keep the food chain going,\u201d Mr Thomson said.\n\nHeavy Vehicle Regulator says fine won't be retracted\n\nA NHVR spokesperson told Yahoo News safety on Australian roads is a \"top priority\" and it's their job to prevent road accidents.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOn 8 June, SCOs intercepted a tractor carrying two double stacked large hay bales on the Henty Highway in Condah, with one of the bales not restrained. The SCOs applied both an engagement and enforcement method, by providing education to the driver on his registration conditions in regard to carrying a load on the highway, and the driver was also issued a minor load restraint infringement for the unrestrained bale,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThough the NHVR is committed to its \u2018inform and educate\u2019 approach, road safety is always the highest priority and enforcement action may be taken when necessary to help ensure all road users, including both the heavy vehicle driver and other motorists, make it to their destination safely.\u201d\n\nAccording to the state's Heavy Vehicle National Law schedule of penalties, Mr Thomson was hit with the minimum fine for breaching mass, dimension or loading requirements. The maximum penalty is an eye-watering $13,310.\n\nDo you have a story tip? Email: newsroomau@yahoonews.com.\n\nYou can also follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube.",
