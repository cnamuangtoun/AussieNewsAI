        "text": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers has kept the door open for another round of electricity rebates, saying the government is yet to rule out what would be a second extension of its key cost-of-living relief policy.\n\nThe rebates were introduced in the 2024 federal budget, providing all households with $300 off their bills over the course of a year at a cost of $3.5 billion.\n\nChalmers then found an extra $1.8 billion to extend the measure in this year's budget for another two quarters \u2013 or $150 per household \u2013 taking the total spend to more than $5 billion.\n\nREAD MORE: Final nail in the coffin for rate cut hopes \ufeff\n\nAustralians could receive another bout of energy bill relief, but have been warned the rebates won't be around forever. (Edwina Pickles/SMH)\n\nBut with the rebates due to expire at the end of the year, and inflation rising \u2013 driven in large part by electricity prices \u2013 the government has been facing questions about whether they will be extended once again.\n\nChalmers said today that that decision was yet to be made, and suggested that an announcement on the policy will be made as part of the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (MYEFO).\n\n\"The mid-year budget update will be towards the middle of December, as it has been on the last couple of occasions,\" the treasurer told reporters this afternoon.\n\n\"We'll take a decision about electricity rebates in the context of finalising that mid-year budget update.\"\n\nJim Chalmers said a decision on the policy will be made in the coming weeks. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nChalmers warned, though, that regardless of the decision made over the next fortnight or so, the rebates will eventually come to an end.\n\n\"They are a really important way that we are helping Australians with the cost of living, taking some of the edge off these electricity price pressures that people are encountering,\" he said.\n\n\"They're a really important part of our budget, but they're not a permanent feature of our budget, and we've made that clear.\"\n\nChalmers' comments came after fresh data showed inflation has reached its highest level in more than a year , with rising electricity prices, caused in part by the end of state-level energy bill relief, a significant contributing factor.",

        "text": "Ahead of the impending under-16 social media ban, nine.com.au has spoken with a number of young content creators to find out what they think about the upcoming changes.\n\nSome describe it as a \"double-edged sword\". Others believe that removing under-16s from their audience will have long-lasting effects on their engagement, audience reach and, subsequently, their livelihoods.\n\nMackenzie McIntyre is a creator from Queensland\ufeff who creates relatable-style observational content, amassing a huge audience in the process.\n\nMcIntyre has garnered over 27 million YouTube views and has over 400,000 TikTok followers. Those numbers could soon take a huge hit once the restrictions come into effect on December 10.\n\n\"I've had a lot of friends, especially who make content for high school, people in high school, pretty concerned recently because it's obviously going to have a huge impact on their engagement.\" Mackenzie McIntyre said.\n\nWhat's your take on the upcoming ban? Let us know at joseph.sahyoun@nine.com.au.\n\nThe new laws are set to come into effect early December. (Nine)\n\n\"The freedom to create as a young person is being really stripped away,\" McIntyre said.\n\n\"Not just like someone who's already creating for viewers, but for people who want to create.\"\n\n\"When I was 15 years old, all I wanted to be was a content creator, so I think that plays a big role in it too.\"\n\nWestern Australia's Empire Family revealed their decision in a video posted to their main channel. (YouTube)\n\nCreators like Western Australia's Empire Family announced to their 1.8 million followers in October that they moved to the UK to avoid the upcoming social media ban. \ufeff\n\n\"I've got a lot of friends who have already, in preparation for the ban or just the regulations that are coming in, have moved to America or moved to Bali, or Indonesia keep that younger audience,\" said Josiah Young .\n\nJosiah is a creator who has been posting relatable content skits since he was 18 and believes that creators will have to adapt to the changes.\n\n\"I will definitely have to start tailoring some of my content.\"\n\n\"I've even started thinking about maybe pushing up that age to kind of end of high school, early university days sort of relatability.\"\n\n\"It might end up being a double-edged sword where kids just end up in these really unsafe places because they are just scrambling to find somewhere that they can continue consuming the content that they've grown up with.\"\n\n\"I think it's almost like it hasn't really sunk in for a lot of creators that there will need to be some sort of change.\"\n\nDane Clarke is the creator of Clarkey's Rugby League Column\n\nClarke's daily rugby league content posted to his Instagram account has fostered an audience of nearly 150,000 followers, including a mix of people who are set to have their accounts wiped on December 10.\n\n\"It will certainly affect my engagement numbers, as the younger generation is a highly engaged portion of my followers,\" Clarke said.\n\nMany creators believe young people will find loopholes to access social media. (CNN)\n\n\"Whenever I meet someone under the age of 18 or looking like they're in high school, they usually tell me that they love my page and get all their news from it daily.\n\n\"I suspect plenty of them will just find an alternate method to access social media. Kids are resourceful, and I am sure they are going to find hundreds of ways to loophole this ban.\"\n\nThe government has placed the responsibility of enforcing the laws into the hands of the social media platforms included in the ban.\n\nThis includes removing and deactivating any accounts used by anyone under the age of 16, as well as preventing the creation of any additional accounts and preventing workarounds that may allow children to bypass the restrictions.\n\n\ufeffThe platforms set to be age-restricted include: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Kick, Twitch and Reddit.\n\nHowever, there are no penalties for under-16s who access age-restricted platforms, \ufeffwith the government stating that the purpose is to protect young Australians rather than punishing and isolating them.\n\nOther creators have echoed this sentiment, believing that \ufeffunder-16s will find their way around the new legislation.\n\n\"I really don't think a lot of them will settle for just not being able to do it,\" McIntrye said.\n\n\"These young people are going to have to find alternative ways to watch this content, whether by using their parents' account, then that messes up all the demographics. statistics and everything.\"\n\nThe ban is set to come into effect on December 10. (Getty)\n\n\"That can also create a dangerous environment because then they may be shown more adult content because the age range is a lot higher.\"\n\nSocial media influencer agencies \ufeffhave been preparing for months in the lead-up to the new laws.\n\n\"Under-16s often drive trends and virality, though their direct purchasing power is limited,\" said Head of Brand and Partnerships at Sticki and DataSauce, Rachael Webb.\n\n\ufeff\"Over the last few months, our focus has been on education, helping brands understand that this legislation represents a delay in when young audiences can legally participate, rather than the disappearance of youth influence online.\"\n\n\"The key challenge for creators is understanding how this will affect their analytics. With Influencer marketing now highly data-driven, engagement metrics may fluctuate as under-16 accounts are removed or restricted.\"\n\nWebb is urging creators to be proactive and use the new laws as a way to test new approaches and formats to see what works as the social media landscape continues to evolve rapidly.\n\n\"\ufeffTest new angles of content, explore what resonates with your other audience segments, and experiment with new creative styles.\"\n\n\"It's rare for a creator's audience to be made up entirely of under-16s, but many will see shifts in their community makeup.\"",

(Getty)\n\nAll direct communication must include a disclaimer\ufeff\n\nLegally, gambling companies are required to include just two things in direct marketing material like texts: consistent \ufeffmessaging about the risks and potential harm of gambling, and a way for consumers to opt out.\n\nThat means all texts must include specific taglines like \"chances are you're about to lose'\"and a link or instructions to unsubscribe.\n\nBetting companies can also only send direct marketing materials to \ufeffcustomers who provide \"express consent\" to receive it, per the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering.\n\nCompanies that send texts after a consumer has unsubscribed are in breach of the Australian Communications and Media Authority's spam rules\n\nEarlier this year \ufeff Tabcorp copped a $4 million fine for spamming VIP customers with thousands of messages without any way to unsubscribe.\n\nIn 2022, Sportsbet was ordered to pay \ufeff$3.7 million in fines for sending more than 150,000 texts and emails to about 37,000 customers who had tried to unsubscribe.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nTabcorp was found to have breached the Australian Communications and Media Authority's spam rules. (Supplied)\n\nWhy are text messages treated differently to other media, such as TV ads?\ufeff\n\nBut because texts count as private messages\ufeff, they can skirt around most public gambling advertising restrictions.\n\n\"One of the big issues here is the rise of smartphones,\" associate professor at CQUniversity's Experimental Gambling Research Laboratory Alex Russell told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"Everyone's got a smartphone in their pocket all the time, and you can bet on that all the time.\"\n\nAnd betting companies can reach customers all the time via texts.\n\nTexts which have been shown to influence consumers to place more bets, larger bets, and riskier bets according to Australian research.\n\nIn a 2018 survey from the \ufeffVictorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, sports bettors received an average of 2.3 texts per week and race bettors averaged \ufeff4.3 texts per week.\n\nSports bettors received an average of 2.3 texts per week from gambling operators. (Getty)\n\nThe texts often included incentives to bet, such as bonus bets and reward points.\ufeff\n\nIn most cases, bettors who received a text responded by placing a bet with the operator that sent it.\n\nThey were also influenced to place more bets, place unplanned bets, make \ufeffimpulsive betting decisions and bet more than planned.\n\n\"We do see that people are targeted more if they are more likely to lose,\" Russell added.\n\n\"So if you're getting offers, it's probably because it's good value for them [gambling companies] to send it to you, because you're going to bet and lose.\"\n\nHow much money are Aussies gamblers losing?\n\nAustralians are the biggest gambling losers in the world per capita, losing about $32 billion annually; more than governments spend on aged care in Australia.\n\nNearly 3.5 million Aussies admitted they are problem or at-risk gamblers in a recent study\n\nThe number of problem gamblers has also risen by 22 per cent since last year.\n\nAnd the losses don't just affect the individual who is gambling.\n\n\"A hell of a lot more people are harmed by gambling,\" Russell said.\n\nBut he questions how Aussi\ufeffes are supposed to break free from gambling addiction when betting companies are able to reach them with targeted texts any hour of the day.\n\nCalls grow for greater regulation around SMS messages\ufeff\n\nGambling reform advocates have called for more transparency and regulation around direct digital marketing materials like texts encouraging bets.\n\nLast year, more than 70 prominent Australians, including former prime ministers,\ufeff signed an open letter calling on the federal government to ban gambling advertising in accordance with the Murphy Report parliamentary inquiry's recommendations.\n\nIndependent Senator David Pocock was one of the signatories.\ufeff\n\n\"The evidence shows that partial advertising bans do not work,\" he told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"The Murphy Report was clear, the Government should immediately ban direct inducements, such as the bonus bets people are offered via personalised texts.\"\n\nSenator David Pocock was one of many prominent Aussies who signed an open letter calling on the federal government to ban gambling advertising in 2024. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nHe called it \"predatory marketing\" that targets Aussies on a losing streak and highlighted the government's inaction in the two years since the Murphy Report was released.\n\n\"There is wide support in the Parliament to ban gambling ads and to ban inducements, but it won't happen while the Prime Minister continues to bow to pressure from the gambling companies and the powerful vested interests who are making too much money off of the suffering of Australians,\" Pocock said.\n\nThe Albanese government has not committed to a ban on gambling advertising.\n\nLast week, the AFR reported the government is actually expected to abandon plans for a total ban on online gambling advertising.\n\nRussell fears it will only do more harm to already struggling Australians.\n\n\"How are you meant to not experience a problem when gambling is so saturated and everywhere?\" Russell said.\n\n\"How are you meant to get away from this?\"\ufeff\n\nThe Albanese government has not committed to a ban on gambling advertising. (Getty)\n\nHow to stop or unsubscribe from \ufeffbetting company texts in Australia\n\nGambling companies are legally required to include a way for consumers to unsubscribe from text marketing in any texts they send.\n\nIn some cases, consumers must text 'STOP' or a similar phrase to a specific number.\n\nIn others, they can click an unsubscribe link in the text and follow the prompts to opt out of text message marketing.\n\nAustralians can also register with BetStop , a free government initiative that blocks all licensed Australian online and phone gambling providers.\ufeff\n\nAfter joining the National Self-Exclusion Register\ufeff, online and phone gambling providers will not be able to send you marketing messages.\n\nHow to report spam texts from gambling companies\n\nIf you think a betting company has broken Australia's spam rules, you can report it to the ACMA by submitting a complaint form.\n\nSpecific spam texts can also be forwarded to the \ufeffACMA on 0429 999 888.",

(Getty Images: Robbie Stephenson)\n\n\"The match referee's 'very good' rating justifies our belief Perth Stadium produced a pitch that provided a fair balance between bat and ball,\" Allsopp said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"The dominance of some brilliant pace bowling from both sides and the frenetic nature of the contest meant the match lasted only two days.\n\n\"This was disappointing for fans holding tickets for days three and four, but we saw some incredible moments which captivated huge viewing audiences and will inspire even more kids to pick up a bat and ball this summer.\n\n\"As always, we want to ensure pitches across Australia have their own characteristics and we're looking forward to another enthralling contest under lights at the Gabba starting next Thursday.\"\n\nThe ICC's assessment follows criticism of the Perth pitch by Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle after the first Test.\n\n\"There were 60000 people expected in Perth today,\" Bhogle posted on X after the match. \"They would have looked forward to a great Sunday for weeks.\n\n\"Even if the batting was unusually frenetic, and the game was extraordinarily gripping, a track that allows a game to end in 2 days isn't fair to the stakeholders of the game.\"\n\nIndian cricket journalist Boria Majumdar also echoed a similar sentiment, claiming there were \"clear double standards\" when assessing pitches in India and around the world.\n\nThe ICC's assessment places more pressure on the poor performance from England's batting line-up, which lasted 32.5 overs in the first innings and 34.4 overs in the second innings. Australia's 45.2-over first innings was the longest of the entire Test.\n\nDespite their failure to adjust to Australian conditions in the first Test, England's players have opted to skip a tour match under lights against the Prime Minister's XI in Canberra beginning Saturday, ahead of next week's pink ball Test in Brisbane.",

(ABC Radio Sydney: Declan Bowring)\n\nMr Bourke said the 2021 changes meant importers no longer had to demonstrate that the bikes met any minimum safety standard or notify that they were importing e-bikes.\n\n\"What that did is it effectively removed the safeguards and opened the door for poor quality products that didn't meet minimum standards for speed and power,\" he said.\n\n\"There are some requirements to meet basic electrical standards, but these of course weren't a mandatory requirement to prove they met it.\n\n\"There were also no mechanical standards, because under Australian consumer law, all e-bikes are exempt from meeting basic bicycle standards anyway.\n\n\" So what we've done is we've got a bicycle standard and e-bike standard, and the federal government effectively said you don't need to meet either. \"\n\nMr Bourke said his organisation would lobby for the newly announced changes to be adopted into road regulations by state governments to make it easier for police to enforce rules against modified e-bikes.\n\nAre there speed limits for e-bikes? Noticing a lot of e-bikes around lately? Here's a state-by-state breakdown of the laws about them.\n\n\"They [riders] will not only have to meet the speeding power restrictions, but they will also have to meet safety restrictions,\" he said.\n\nThe number of children injured while riding e-bikes has risen as e-bikes have become more popular.\n\nRecent data from the Sydney's Children's Hospital Network shows 94 children have presented to hospitals in Sydney because of injuries from riding e-bikes this year, almost triple the figure in 2023.\n\nBicycle NSW chief executive Peter McLean welcomed the changes and said he hoped to see the impact on the ground soon.\n\n\"[The 2021 changes] have allowed for the mass importation of illegal devices,\" Mr McLean said.\n\n\"Certainly fixing up this standard will ensure that things will change reasonably quickly.\"",

        "text": "The banking regulator will impose restrictions on home loans from early next year to limit the number of \"high-risk\" large loans being issued to customers, which could have major implications for home prices.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will impose so-called macroprudential restrictions on home loans from February 1, meaning that no more than 20 per cent of a bank's new loans can have a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of more than six.\n\nFor example, a household with an annual household income of $100,000 a year receiving a loan greater than $600,000 would be counted towards that limit.\n\nThe regulator says the 20 per cent cap will apply separately to investor and owner-occupier loans, to avoid the risk of investors \"crowding out\" owner-occupier buyers.\n\nAPRA said the 20 per cent cap was expected to bite harder for investors, who tended to borrow more relative to their incomes.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's chair, John Lonsdale, said the banking regulator was acting pre-emptively to head off risks generated by a booming housing market.\n\n\"One of the key structural risks to system stability that APRA has long been concerned about is high household indebtedness,\" he noted in a statement.\n\n\" Rising indebtedness has in the past often been associated with an increase in riskier lending and rapid growth in property prices. \"\n\nGovernment welcomes move, Greens call for tougher investor limits\n\nWhen asked in a media briefing whether the treasurer, Reserve Bank and other regulators had been consulted about the move, Mr Lonsdale confirmed they had.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers released a statement this morning backing the regulator's action.\n\n\"These are important changes that will help with financial resilience and housing affordability,\" he argued.\n\n\" It's about managing emerging risks in our financial system and will help people into the market. \"\n\nHowever, Greens Senator Barbara Pocock, who recently wrote to the treasurer and APRA calling for macroprudential intervention in home lending, said the limits were not tough enough.\n\nHow Australia's housing market spun out of control Property investment is ingrained in the Australian psyche, but is it too easy to cast landlords as the villain in our housing crisis?\n\n\"$40 billion has gone to investors in the last three months, and APRA and Chalmers need to stop the tens of billions flowing to investors,\" she said.\n\n\"APRA must use all the tools in their toolbox to rein in investor lending that is exacerbating the housing affordability crisis.\"\n\nAustralia's bank regulator has never imposed a cap on high debt-to-income lending before but other nations, such as the UK and New Zealand, have had similar restrictions for many years.\n\nAPRA did impose a 10 per cent per annum limit on investor lending growth in 2014 and added a cap limiting interest-only lending to 30 per cent of new loans in 2017, both of which were removed during 2018.\n\nAustralia's largest recent home price correction occurred during this period from late 2017 to early 2019, where values fell 8.2 per cent nationally, led by an even steeper decline in Sydney.\n\nFew banks and borrowers likely to be affected\n\nThe regulator said, overall, only about 4 per cent of new owner-occupier loans and 10 per cent of new investor loans were above the six-times income threshold, but added that there was a small number of institutions that were already near or above the 20 per cent cap.\n\n\"Although broader risks are contained, we have seen in the past that they can build rapidly when interest rates are low or declining, borrowers extend themselves and competition among banks for new mortgage lending intensifies, which can lead to easing lending standards,\" Mr Lonsdale warned.\n\n\" We will consider additional limits, including investor-specific limits, if we see macrofinancial risks significantly rising or a deterioration in lending standards. \"\n\nAPRA said bridging loans and loans for the construction of new dwellings would be excluded from the cap to avoid wider disruptions across the home building sector and keep out of the way of federal and state government ambitions to increase new home building.\n\nAustralian Banking Association CEO Simon Birmingham welcomed APRA's \"targeted and considered approach\".\n\n\"It is important that settings maintain access to safe financing through banks and not create any barriers that could unduly push borrowers into higher-risk non-bank lenders,\" he said.\n\n\"Whilst macroprudential policy settings are important for financial stability, the best way to address housing affordability is to boost supply, and we therefore welcome APRA's exemption of loans for new dwellings.\"\n\nAPRA does have powers to impose macroprudential controls on entities that it does not normally regulate, such as non-bank lenders, if it believes that their behaviours are creating vulnerabilities for the broader financial system.",

        "text": "What might have been deemed a wobble appears to be a full-blown crisis for Arne Slot at Liverpool, with the beleaguered English champions getting thrashed for the third straight game.\n\nIt is now nine defeats in its last 12 games for Liverpool after PSV Eindhoven left Anfield with a 4-1 win in the Champions League. The Reds were coming off 3-0 losses in the Premier League to Manchester City before the international break and Nottingham Forest on Saturday.\n\nThe run of form is Liverpool's worst since 1953-54, and has placed manager Arne Slot under increasing pressure \u2014 an inconceivable scenario, given Liverpool cruised to the Premier League title a matter of months ago \u2014 and defensive mistakes again led to his team's downfall against PSV.\n\nThe loss made it three consecutive losses by three or more goals for Liverpool for the first time since December 1953.\n\nFirstly, Virgil van Dijk's raised hand touched the ball at a corner to give away a penalty, converted by 36-year-old Ivan Perisic for the opener to the Dutch champions.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai equalised 10 minutes later but after Guus Til regained the lead for PSV, Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate \u2014 a target for criticism from fans and pundits alike in recent months \u2014 missed the ball completely to let the visitors in on goal again.\n\nAmerican forward Ricardo Pepi shot against the post and Couhaib Driouech was there to convert the rebound.\n\nDriouech added a fourth in stoppage time to complete the humiliation.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 scores a hat-trick in seven minutes\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 (right) scored a hat-trick inside just seven minutes as Real Madrid recorded a comfortable win against Olympiakos. (Getty Images: Alex Pantling)\n\nReal Madrid star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has scored the second-fastest hat trick in Champions League history by netting three times in just under seven minutes at Olympiakos on Wednesday in his side's chaotic 4-3 win.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 scored in the 22nd, 24th and 29th minutes \u2014 after Chiquinho had put Olympiakos ahead in the eighth. The France international also scored a fourth goal in the 60th after Mehdi Taremi had scored for the hosts in the 52nd.\n\nMohamed Salah's hat-trick for Liverpool at Rangers in 2022 had broken the record for the quickest ever scored in the Champions League, according to UEFA. The Egypt forward needed six minutes, 12 seconds to score his goals after entering the match seven minutes before his opening strike.\n\nIt was Mbapp\u00e9's fifth hat trick in the Champions League \u2014 and second this season. He had scored three times against Kairat in the second round of the league phase.\n\nLionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have eight hat-tricks each in the Champions League, while Robert Lewandowski has six.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 now leads the Champions League in scoring this season with nine goals, three more than Galatasaray's Victor Osimhen.\n\nArsenal top after winning heavyweight clash\n\nArsenal has beaten Bayern Munich for the first time in a decade to maintain its perfect record in this season's Champions League with a 3-1 victory, sending them top of the table.\n\nJurrien Timber headed Mikel Arteta's side in front from a corner after 22 minutes only for Bayern teenager Lennart Karl to equalise in style before half-time.\n\nArsenal dominated the second half and showed their immense squad depth as substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scored the goals to make it five wins from five.\n\nThursday's major Champions League results Arsenal 3-1 Bayern Munich\n\n3-1 Bayern Munich Atletico Madrid 2-1 Inter Milan\n\n2-1 Inter Milan Liverpool 1-4 PSV Eindhoven\n\nOlympiakos 3-4 Real Madrid\n\nPSG 5-3 Tottenham\n\nIt proved a quiet return to north London for prolific Bayern striker Harry Kane as his side suffered their first defeat of the season in all competitions.\n\nWith Inter Milan dropping points, Arsenal are now the only team in the competition with a maximum 15 points and look all but assured of a place in the last 16.\n\nSix points clear at the top of the Premier League and Bundesliga respectively and boasting flawless records after four games in the Champions League, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have been Europe's stand-out teams this season.\n\nThe sides met in the quarterfinals two years ago with Bayern coming out on top, but Arsenal have moved to another level since that clash and went into Wednesday's game on a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions.\n\nWith last-16 spots already looking safe for both clubs, the 15th meeting between them lacked jeopardy, but bragging rights and psychological blows were up for grabs.\n\nIt was Arsenal who emerged with both, thanks to a win that will reverberate around Europe.\n\nAP/Reuters",

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I'm happy the Queensland selectors probably saw that,\" he said of his latest Shield century.\n\n\"Knowing that we won the game for Queensland was something that was pretty special.\n\n\"We had a few guys missing in that Test squad, so knowing that, as a senior batter for Queensland, standing up and doing my job and getting the win at midnight on day three was pretty nice.\"\n\nHaving two children \u2014 Charlotte and Edward \u2014 has helped take the stress off wondering if he will receive another Test call-up.\n\n\"Definitely handling it a lot better nowadays, there's a lot more calm in my life,\" Renshaw said.\n\n\"Old Matt Renshaw wouldn't have had to go home and change nappies or wake up in the morning and go to a kids sport game.\n\n\"Stuff like that definitely changes your perspective on a lot of things, so just enjoying where my life is at the moment.\"\n\nAAP",

It may not be her strongest gig, but you know you have a star on your hands when a singer who is losing their voice can still make a packed crowd purr.\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets\n\nDANCE\n\nPieces \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nUMAC, Parkville, until November 28 Choreographer Jo Lloyd\u2019s Post Hoc is the standout contribution to this year\u2019s edition of Pieces, the annual Lucy Guerin Inc showcase of short works. It\u2019s a nervy, almost frantic composition, very stark in its arrangement, but with a strange kind of delicacy. Post Hoc by Jo Lloyd. Credit: Georgia Haupt There\u2019s a pleasing sense of return here, since Lloyd also appeared in the inaugural Pieces program 20 years ago. In the decades since, she has emerged as one of her generation\u2019s most prolific, influential and determinedly avant-garde choreographers. Here she works with two recent VCA graduates, Flynn Dakis and Jesper Harrison, who appear small and exposed on the vast UMAC stage. Dressed in bizarre skimpy underwear \u2013 one buttock hanging free \u2013 they skitter across the space like paper scraps.\n\nThey periodically force themselves together, a brief shove-and-grapple that sends them spiralling to the back of the stage. Duane Morrison\u2019s hectic sound design \u2013 full of explosions and muttered curses \u2013 creates a sense of impending disaster. The title means \u201cafter the fact\u201d, and you can imagine the two dancers scurrying through the remnants of Lloyd\u2019s earlier works, quoting stray forms and phrases, before collapsing together in a heap, as if in imitation of all that gets left behind. Hush by Siobhan McKenna. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti Two other works complete the program. The first, Siobhan McKenna\u2019s Hush, neatly demonstrates how not-quite-linguistic vocalisations \u2013 sighs, hums, gasps and other small breathy noises \u2013 operate as meaningful utterances, conveying attitude and affect without words.\n\nThese sounds are bound to physical gestures, which McKenna uses as material for a well-shaped \u2013 if not terribly interesting \u2013 movement score. McKenna is an accomplished choreographer, but in this piece, I think she might have pushed further into the ambiguities and occasional failures of these non-words. The other work, Lip by Jenni Large, is memorable for its costuming, if nothing else. Large herself appears in a scarlet cap-a-pie outfit designed by Jarred Dewey, with suggestive references to Atsuko Kudo, Martin Margiela and those unsettling fantasy figures associated with Eiko Ishioka. Lip by Jenni Large. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti It\u2019s a strong statement of aesthetic preferences \u2013 part cosplay, part fetishwear \u2013 but as a performance, it feels underdone, particularly in its attempt to fold composer Anna Whitaker into the action. The program notes frame the work as a study of revenge cycles, which is plausible: Large is like a spirit of blind red fury, a demon that takes possession of Whitaker. Yet the gradual stripping back of the costume to reveal the real person beneath opens more questions than the piece ultimately resolves.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nMUSIC\n\nDaniel M\u00fcller-Schott with Konstantin Shamray \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, November 25 German cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott has returned to Melbourne, filling Elisabeth Murdoch Hall with the glorious resonance and many-splendoured lyricism of his 1727 \u201cEx Shapiro\u201d Matteo Goffriller cello. Cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott Noting his instrument is almost exactly contemporaneous with Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No. 3 in C major, BWV 1009, M\u00fcller-Schott brought an expansive, larger-than-life feeling to this classic. Like the rest of the suite, the Prelude was flexible yet rhythmic, powered by artistic and technical assurance. Other movements were beautifully characterised, with especially telling contrasts between the sprightly Courante and the intense yet subtly coloured Sarabande, while the well-known Bour\u00e9e and the rustic Gigue were buoyed by joyous rhythmic energy.\n\nTogether with Russian-born, Australian-based pianist Konstantin Shamray, M\u00fcller-Schott offered great insights into Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Sonata in D minor, Op. 40. Once again proving himself to be an extraordinary colourist, M\u00fcller-Schott gave the opening two themes a life of their own, with exchanges between instruments deftly handled. Loading At the centre of the work, the third-movement Largo became a soul-searing expression of heartache. This vividly etched lament was surrounded by remarkable vigour, both in the second-movement Allegro and in the impish finale. Throughout, the artists harnessed Shostakovich\u2019s formidable array of technical demands to memorable musical ends. From the outset, Brahms\u2019 Cello Sonata No. 2 in F major, Op. 99 overflowed with grandeur and ardent passion. Thanks to the superb instrument, the pizzicato in the Adagio had an unusual depth, while the middle section of the Allegro passionato was yet another instance of the cello\u2019s voice taking on an almost-human quality. The cheerful, hope-giving finale set the seal on arguably one of the best concerts of the year. How wonderful to see M\u00fcller-Schott\u2019s generous, open personality and poetic musicianship garner him quite a following of young fans, teeming in the audience and listening with rapt attention.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nCABARET\n\nMeow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMalthouse Theatre, until December 6 The original Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale involves a girl enamoured with a pair of red shoes. As punishment for her vanity, the shoes are cursed, and she\u2019s forced to dance in them forever. Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes is a retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson classic. Credit: Brett Boardman Even when her feet are amputated, the shoes still dance tauntingly before her. Yes, it\u2019s grim, as a lot of these unvarnished fairytales are wont to be, but this is Meow Meow\u2019s Red Shoes, and she has her own ideas about the classic story. It\u2019s the third iteration in her fairytale series, after The Little Matchstick Girl and The Little Mermaid. The show opens on a comic note with the performer (otherwise known as Melissa Madden Gray) being dragged on stage by her legs. This self-confessed \u201ceternal showgirl\u201d has lost her muse; she\u2019s a marionette slackened with existential angst and more attuned to the sorry, lustreless state of the world.\n\nIndeed, Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood with its mountain of debris and a plastic curtain. Meow Meow climbs up and down this graveyard of rubbish, singing and emoting and resplendent in a black mini dress, bouffant hair and even bigger plumed headgear. The musicians (Mark Jones, Dan Witton and Jethro Woodward) are in distressed tuxedoes, and between them play an astonishing array of instruments including piano, guitar, double bass, drums and tuba. Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood. Credit: Brett Boardman Meow Meow\u2019s energy is unflagging: aside from the actual dancing (sometimes lopsidedly with different footwear), she also hops, crawls and does the splits. She can be vulnerable one moment (hobbling around trying to find her missing red shoe), and brazen the next, in an interactive aside with the audience to \u201credistribute the wealth\u201d. There\u2019s a lot going on in this digressive show with its various sprays against communism, capitalism and world greed in general. It\u2019s a springboard of ideas, but it\u2019s difficult to find the skein of narrative about the titular red shoes in between all the play and hijinks.\n\nMeow Meow does challenge Andersen (Kanen Breen) at one point about the fairytale\u2019s punitive corrective against a girl who simply wanted to dance. Maybe dancing isn\u2019t the problem, but the cure? Maybe we need more art in our lives? The ambiguities are open to interpretation. Could Red Shoes also be a self-reflexive comment about diva narcissism seeking external validation or the peripatetic career path of artists? Kanen Breen and Meow Meow in Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes. Credit: Brett Boardman In the movie of The Wizard of Oz, after a series of (mis)adventures, Dorothy\u2019s ruby shoes took her home; in this story they have the opposite effect: they\u2019re a talisman of the dangers of creative ambition, of the neverending desire to prove oneself, even if that aspiration can take you (like Meow Meow\u2019s career) far away from home. For those hoping or expecting linearity and cohesion, you\u2019d leave bewildered with this rag-tag assortment of song, dance and spectacle but if you\u2019re a fan of cabaret with a twist of the absurd, Meow Meow\u2019s charisma and rich honeyed tones, Breen\u2019s operatic tenor, and the trio of musicians provide theatrical ballast.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nMUSIC\n\nRyman Healthcare Spring Gala: Joyce DiDonato \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Symphony Orchestra, Hamer Hall, November 21 Making her first major Australasian tour, American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato confirmed her reputation as one of this generation\u2019s most compelling classical singers in a memorably sophisticated account of Berlioz\u2019 song cycle Nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 (Summer Nights) with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn. American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato performs with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Laura Manariti DiDonato took evident delight in revealing the elegant sensuality and profound emotion flowing from this supreme expression of French romanticism. Charting a journey from innocence through loss to new life, the six songs were a perfect vehicle for her vocal versatility. Keenly alive to musical and textual nuance, DiDonato\u2019s voice of liquid gold brought simple delight to Villanelle, exquisitely contrasted by the ruminative ecstasy of The Spectre of the Rose in which the climactic line, \u201cI come from paradise\u201d was superbly seductive. Contemplating isolation and death, On the Lagoons, Absence and At the Cemetery brought out the alluring, expressive qualities of her lower range, before radiant enthusiasm marked her sailing to The Unknown Isle.\n\nA generous performer, DiDonato offered two encores: a steamy Habanera from Bizet\u2019s Carmen and then, making a link between her native Kansas and the Land of Oz, a heartwarming rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Beginning with Rossini\u2019s William Tell overture may seem hackneyed but the initial rapturous cello solo brilliantly delivered by David Berlin offset the all-too-familiar gallop. Jaime Mart\u00edn conducts the Spring Gala. Credit: Laura Manariti After interval came two-thirds of Respighi\u2019s Roman trilogy: The Fountains of Rome and The Pines of Rome. While the latter undeniably ends in a blaze of glory, such unimaginative programming forfeited the opportunity of introducing a large audience to the least heard and arguably the best of the three suites, The Festivals of Rome. That said, the orchestral playing was consistently engaging and the Berlioz especially was sensitively accompanied. However, the night belonged to DiDonato, who hopefully can dazzle Melbourne again soon.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nPixies \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Festival Hall, November 19 Female bass players are to the Pixies as drummers are to Spinal Tap: they\u2019ve had a lot of them. Kim Deal (1987-2012), Kim Shattuck (briefly in 2013), Paz Lenchantin (2014-2023) have all come and gone. Black Francis of Pixies performs onstage at Festival Hall, November 19, 2025. Credit: Richard Clifford Now it\u2019s Emma Richardson\u2019s turn to provide the driving bass and sweet harmonies that are so crucial to the Boston-born band\u2019s loud-quiet-loud dynamic. And she stands tall, literally and figuratively, towering over frontman Black Francis, guitarist Joey Santiago and drummer Dave Lovering when the four embrace and take a well-earned bow at the end of their blistering 32-song two-hour set on Wednesday night. This is the back-to-back album show, in which the band play Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991) track by track, throwing in a handful of faves at the end for good measure. On this tour, they alternate set lists across two-night engagements, with the second set featuring a best-of collection from across their catalogue, plus some songs from their new album, The Night the Zombies Came.\n\nPixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. As they take the stage \u2013 unadorned, apart from a winged P and four spheres that morph from planets to eyes over the course of the show (nods to the respective albums\u2019 cover art) \u2013 Francis takes a sip from a mug and says \u201chello time travellers\u201d before offering some background on the origins of Cecilia Ann, the opening track on Bossanova (a cover of a Surftones song recorded in 1964 but not released until 1988, its origins are in French composer Gabriel Faure\u2019s Sicilienne \u2026 apparently). It\u2019s the fourth time I\u2019ve seen the Pixies live (the first was at their absolute peak in 1989), and before they\u2019ve played a note, Francis has already said a lot more than in the three other shows combined. Pixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. Credit: Richard Clifford He\u2019s in a good mood, and no wonder. The band is tight as, ripping through songs at a rate of knots. \u201cThank you. The songs are kind of short, I know,\u201d he says at one point. And he\u2019s right. Some barely pass the 90-second mark. His voice is different than it was in 1987, when their debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim blasted onto the world. It\u2019s gruffer, scarred by the screams that litter many tracks, but the counterpoint upper register is still intact. It works.\n\nSantiago\u2019s guitar work is as good as ever, searing, surfy, scintillating, and on Velouria, Allison, Is She Weird and Dig For Fire, the band sounds as good as they ever did. The energy kicks up a notch when they trip into the Trompe set, with barely a pause to note the transition. This is a punkier set of songs, fast and furious, and the crowd becomes more energised as the set wears on. Loading The influence of Pixies, who recorded just four studio albums in their first wave of mutilation before breaking up in 1993 (and another five since reforming in 2004), has been well noted, with Nirvana and Weezer among the many to have paid homage. But on this night, with this set list, the backward lineage was apparent too: a cover of Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On, the aforementioned Surftones track (and a general infusion of surf-guitar sounds throughout), and, in the final bracket of non-album tracks, Neil Young\u2019s Winterlong. It was a welcome reminder that although it sometimes felt like they\u2019d arrived from nowhere \u2013 or, maybe, from outer space \u2013 the Pixies were indeed born of this world. They\u2019re strange, jarring, at times unfathomable, but on this form they remain as vital as ever.\n\nReviewed by Karl Quinn\n\nDANCE\n\nBrigid \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, until November 22 The room fills with haze while the dancers lie prone, hiding their faces. It\u2019s an opening scene that recalls those old images of Celtic romance: an orange twilight glow, frothing vapours and ancient figures half-buried in the earth. Brigid is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name Credit: Agust\u00edn Far\u00edas Brigid, created by Alice Heyward and Ois\u00edn Monaghan, is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name, one of the folk divinities of that legendary age before recorded history \u2013 the imagined time of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. We actually know very little about this daughter of the Dagda. Her story has been partly obscured by the later Saint Brigid of Kildare, the famous abbess and miracle-worker, the so-called Mary of the Gael who turned dirty bathwater into beer.\n\nIn looking back to the older Brigid, Heyward and Monaghan seem to take her obscurity as a cue. This is a work full of uncertainties and strange vacancies amid the rattling, racketing old-style jigging that fills the space. Loading The three performers \u2013 Heyward, Monaghan and Oonagh Slater \u2013 slowly raise themselves. You feel the heaviness of it, the work of dragging something old and earth-loving back into motion. They fall and fall again, landing with real weight. The dancing arrives gradually. At first, they fall into step together: a fleeting suggestion, perhaps, of the goddess\u2019s triple aspect. Then they separate, moving with apparent freedom across the long, windy gap between lights set at either end of the studio. Monaghan\u2019s boots slap the boards like antique flat irons. Or maybe hammers. Is this a vision of Brigid in her role as patroness of blacksmiths? The loud percussive steps follow closely the work of sound designer Gregor Kompar, who also performs live.",

        "text": "Where once Hassett, then regarded as a mainstream economist, advocated a carbon tax on coal and petrol and was pro-immigration and anti-protectionism, now he echoes Trump\u2019s aversion to \u201cgreen\u201d policies (he, too, lambasts wind turbines for killing birds), is an enthusiastic supporter of the administration\u2019s harsh treatment of immigrants and of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Like Bessent, he says an economic bonanza from the whirlwind of the administration\u2019s policies, particularly the tariffs and Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill, with its tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts to health and other services for the not-so-wealthy, is just over the horizon. US government deficits and debt, Hassett has claimed, are declining because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Jerome Powell may make life difficult for Trump by staying on the Fed\u2019s board after his term as chair ends. Credit: AP The deficit has reduced, from $US1.82 trillion ($2.8 trillion) in the 2023-24 financial year under Joe Biden, to $US1.8 trillion. Government debt, however, has risen from $US36.2 trillion at the end of last year to $US38.1 trillion this year and is still climbing, despite the tariff revenues. The administration never lets the facts get in the way of the story.\n\nLoading Hassett fits Trump\u2019s bill for the next chair of the Fed better than any of the other candidates and it will be Trump who makes the final call on who is presented to the Senate for confirmation. That he is favoured by betting markets and Fed watchers and those closest to the administration doesn\u2019t mean his appointment is inevitable, however. As White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said this week: \u201cNo one really knows what President Trump is going to do until he does it.\u201d What we do know is that the next Fed chair will only be chosen if they agree to do what Trump wants, which means he\u2019ll expect them to get the Fed to slash interest rates. He will also want them to shake up the Fed and its processes, which most of the candidates have signalled they would.\n\nWhether they\u2019d be prepared to do to the Fed what the administration has done to other key US agencies like the Department of Justice \u2013 purging the existing staff, replacing them with MAGA people and making it subservient to Trump\u2019s whims \u2013 is a more open question, although Hassett, the closest of the candidates to Trump and the Trumpist agenda, might be more willing to pursue that objective than the others. Powell\u2019s term as the Fed\u2019s chair doesn\u2019t end until next May, but his preferred successor will be nominated well before then \u2013 Bessent has signalled that it will be before the end of the year \u2013 because the administration believes the confirmation process for such a powerful and sensitive position could be protracted. Sharemarkets would welcome Hassett\u2019s appointment but bond investors wouldn\u2019t be quite as enthusiastic. Credit: Bloomberg A chairman-elect, waiting in the wings, could also put pressure on the Fed\u2019s board and members of the 12-person committee that actually sets US monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to fall more into line with Trump\u2019s wishes. Hassett, if he is Trump\u2019s choice, would, of course, be only one of seven Fed governors, albeit the first among equals, and only one of the 12 FOMC\u2019s voting members. (There are another seven regional Fed bank presidents who attend and participate in meetings, but don\u2019t vote.)\n\nThose FOMC members have, unusually for an institution that has generally been consensus-driven, shown increasingly divergent views this year. There is no guarantee that they will fall into line with the new chair\u2019s wishes. Loading It is also possible that the FOMC members might break with the tradition of appointing the Fed\u2019s chair as chair of their committee. They appoint their chair from within their ranks and could vote for someone else, perhaps even Powell. While Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor doesn\u2019t end until 2028. His predecessors have tended to quit the Fed entirely once they have completed their terms at the head of the boardroom table, but there\u2019s no requirement that they do so. Powell hasn\u2019t provided any indication of his intentions but, if he were to hang on, not only would he deny Trump the opportunity to appoint another governor \u2013 the new chair would have to be slotted into the seat being kept warm until February by another Trump loyalist, Stephen Miran \u2013 but there would potentially be a countervailing influence within the Fed and FOMC to Trump\u2019s chair.\n\nThere\u2019s another potential source of opposition. What we do know is that the next Fed chair will only be chosen if they agree to do what Trump wants, which means he\u2019ll expect them to get the Fed to slash interest rates. Sharemarket and crypto investors and the artificial intelligence companies investing increasingly expensive trillions of dollars of capital would love Hassett to be appointed. Lower interest rates are supportive of equity and crypto values. Rates as low as those Trump wants would potentially turbocharge risk assets, boost near-term economic growth and (which is another reason for Trump\u2019s advocacy of slashing rates) significantly lower the interest costs of the US government\u2019s debt. Investors in bonds wouldn\u2019t be quite as enthusiastic. Inflation is their bete noir and slashing rates while the US inflation rate (3 per cent and edging up as the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are starting to show up) is well above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target is a recipe for accelerating inflation.",

        "text": "And all of this is on top of tax increases worth \u00a340 billion in last year\u2019s budget. Labour is making no bones about its targets. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told parliament on Wednesday afternoon (about midnight, AEDT) that she wanted to lift tax rates on income from property, savings and dividends. Loading \u201cI will make further reforms to our tax system today to make it fairer \u2013 and to ensure the wealthiest contribute the most,\u201d she said. The new property tax will hit many parts of London and the wealthier regional cities, where families already struggle to buy a home. The \u201chigh-value council tax surcharge\u201d will start at \u00a32500 per year in England for residential properties worth \u00a32 million or more.\n\nThe benchmark is very high for most workers, but the base level is about the price of a modern three-bedroom flat in Notting Hill or a two-bedroom in Chelsea \u2013 which goes to show that looking for property in fashionable London is only a game for the wealthy. Reeves, again, is unapologetic about making some people pay more. In her budget speech, she said a landlord with income of \u00a325,000 currently pays about \u00a31200 less in tax each year than a tenant who gets the same income as a salary. Does that make her a modern Robin Hood? Not at all. Most workers who pay tax are not getting money back from the government for the simple reason that there is no money to spare. The fact is that Britain\u2019s finances are in a dire state after years of deficits. Despite the tax grabs in this week\u2019s budget, the national debt will be slightly higher as a percentage of the economy than projected in March, says the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). That is partly because the OBR expects the economy to grow more slowly over the next few years, eking out 1.5 per cent a year compared to the earlier outlook for 1.8 per cent.\n\nGloom on the streets The official forecast matches the gloom on the streets, where small stores complain about shoplifting. While the restaurants are full in the glitzier parts of London, things are quieter in areas where tourists do not roam. Britain\u2019s net financial debt will reach \u00a32.6 trillion this year \u2013 and Reeves is warning that 10 per cent of government spending now goes on the interest bill. In Australia, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the bill is 3.6 per cent of outlays. This highlights a far more dangerous dynamic for Britain than Australia. Put simply, the markets are dictating terms to London in a way Canberra is yet to see. The more Britain borrows, the edgier the markets get. Liz Truss resigned after just 49 days in office, making her Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister. Credit: Bloomberg\n\nWhile Australia has an AAA credit rating, the UK is considered AA and has a troubled history with the markets. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, as prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, triggered a crisis in October 2022 with their budget plans; both were gone soon afterwards. Reeves could not keep the markets calm without her tax hikes. She could, in theory, slash spending, but the Labour backbench is already restive about the leadership and rebelled against welfare cuts in July. It wanted more spending on welfare, not less. Starmer and Reeves chose not to argue. And this produced the big winners on budget day: families on income support with more than two children. The Conservatives stopped families getting benefits for more than their second child, but Labour will reinstate the old regime. Low-income families will receive more money for their children, funded by higher taxes on workers. Reeves says she is proud to be acting on child poverty, but the debate will grow about the scale of the tax burden and the size of the welfare state. If productivity is lower than the government assumes, the deficits will continue for the decade ahead. And the fact is that British productivity is in the doldrums.\n\nIn the end, the markets seemed to welcome the new plan. The pound rose against the US dollar and the euro. The borrowing costs on British government bonds fell. This was the most important reaction to the budget, given the size of the British debt, but it has no visibility for most of the British media or the public. The run-up to the budget has been dominated by ferocious complaints about tax increases and spending cuts, with scant mention of the size of the interest bill on years of carefree borrowing. Reeves had a glowing forecast for parliament. She said the deficit would be \u00a328.8bn in 2026-27 and then shrink to \u00a34.6 billion the following year. By the subsequent year, she said, Britain would be posting a \u00a33.9 billion surplus, with much bigger ones after that. The forecasts, of course, hardly ever turn out to be true. There is a warning in the analysis from the independent OBR about how it could all go wrong. If productivity is lower than the government assumes, the deficits will continue for the decade ahead. And the fact is that British productivity is in the doldrums. Starmer and Reeves need an economic revival to deliver the budget recovery they promise. The soundtrack to their budget comes from Dusty Springfield, who lived near Notting Hill in the days it was affordable: wishing and a-hoping.",

        "text": "Labor has struck a deal with the Greens to pass the largest reforms to Australia's environmental laws in 26 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese announced at a press conference on Thursday morning that the government's law reforms would pass parliament later in the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes more than five years after professor Graeme Samuel delivered his landmark review of Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a landmark day for the environment in this country,\" Albanese told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seven bills are set to pass the Senate on the final sitting day of the parliamentary year, after passing the lower house last month.\n\n\n\nWhat is in the bill?\n\nThe reforms include new environmental standards to guide project decisions based on environmental impacts and changing the thresholds for accepting or rejecting high-polluting projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nA national Environment Protection Agency (EPA) will be set up, and there will be higher penalties for serious breaches of environmental law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment minister will retain approval powers over the EPA.\n\n\n\nStricter rules will be imposed on land clearing and native forest logging, and companies will need to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions expected from projects when they submit them for approval.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoal and gas projects will not be eligible for \"fast-tracking\" and will also require federal approval for their water use.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese said the government would also establish a $300 million forestry growth fund to support jobs in the industry.\n\n\n\n'Tough' negotiations\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt said the passage of the laws had been \"years in the making\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Watt had a flurry of negotiation meetings with both the Greens and the Coalition, having offered both sides a different set of amendments the previous day to get them across the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the concessions sent on Tuesday, seen by SBS News, Labor addressed the Greens' concerns about coal and gas expansion by limiting the fast-tracking of fossil fuel projects and excluding the expansion of coal and gas from the national interest exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young told ABC on Thursday morning that there had been \"tough negotiation\" with Labor over the reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've put a stop to the fossil fuel industry getting fast track and easy access to environmental approvals.\"\n\n\n\nWhen asked about negotiations with the Coalition, Watt told reporters the Opposition is \"in shambles\" when it comes to policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Coalition is a shambles, and they've been a shambles on these negotiations as well,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can't strike a deal with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they want.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt said he has \"great confidence\" in the laws after working with the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That gives me confidence that these laws will work for both the environment and for business,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley described the Labor-Greens partnership as a \"dirty deal\" that will impact cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is going to put energy prices up and provide further pressure on electricity bills for struggling households and families, for the simple reason that the Greens have got what they want,\" Ley said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said \"good faith\" conversations between the Coalition and Labor had been taking place until 9:30pm on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "While Black Friday officially starts on Friday, sales are already rolling out online as brands jump onto one of the busiest retail periods of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it can also be a tricky time for consumers navigating impulse buys and trying to work out whether a deal is actually as good as it seems.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half (53 per cent) of surveyed shoppers have regretted a purchase or had a negative experience during the Black Friday sales, according to a poll of 1,009 Australians from consumer advocacy group CHOICE.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 47 per cent said Black Friday marketing made them feel pressured to buy, while 52 per cent said they spent more than they intended. Some 28 per cent said the goods they received were of lower quality than expected.\n\n\n\nThat last one could be a sign of a new \"widespread\" scam operating in Australia \u2014 \"ghost stores\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCatriona Lowe, deputy chair at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), told SBS World News: \"Increasingly, scammers are utilising technology very effectively.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are creating websites or emails that can look very convincing, very like a legitimate business or website.\"\n\n\n\nSome 28 per cent of those surveyed said they'd bought something in Black Friday sales that were lower quality than they expected. Source: SBS News Here's what ghost stores are \u2014 and how to avoid them this Black Friday.\n\n\n\nWhat are 'ghost stores'?\n\nGhost stores look and feel like legitimate businesses \u2014 but they're actually a new type of scam that has the ACCC on alert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're a relatively new type of scam that we've been hearing about more over the last year or so,\" CHOICE's Liam Kennedy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of impersonating established big-name brands, scammers are building these websites which pretend to be local businesses.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What Black Friday sales shopping does to your brain, and how to stay in control\n\nBut they rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 send consumers the product they paid for.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gary Mortimer, retail marketing researcher at the Queensland University of Technology, told SBS News: \"You tend to find that what you're buying either never turns up at your door or what turns up is basically a poor quality product, despite these ghost stores online looking like top-tier local brands.\"\n\n\n\nTelltale signs of a ghost store\n\nBecause ghost stores are designed to look legitimate, they can be difficult to spot at first glance. But there are a few red flags.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey typically sell clothing and shoes, often advertise through social media, and frequently rebrand under names that use Australian suburbs or cities to appear local.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They craft a story where they're this long-running business selling good quality products at a small scale, but they've had to close down \u2026 there's usually a sob story involved,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\n\nThey also tend to offer unusually steep discounts \u2014 often between 70 and 80 per cent \u2014 and use countdown timers or language like \"time is running out\" to create urgency, Mortimer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick search on social media can help uncover whether a business is legitimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ghost stores we saw that were still active on Facebook had just a handful of likes and followers,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any sort of local business selling good quality products for a decent amount of time will have much more than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there's no physical address on its website, that's also a big red flag.\"\n\n\n\nRise of ghost stores\n\nThe consumer watchdog has in recent times warned of a rise in so-called ghost stores \u2014 and the urgency of Black Friday sales could make shoppers more susceptible, though the scam operates year-round.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a July statement, the ACCC said an estimated 360 complaints had been made about 60 online retailers since the beginning of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the conduct \"appears to be widespread\" with many more likely in operation.\n\n\n\nCanstar spokesperson Eden Radford said Black Friday is a \"prime time for scammers\", who often create a sense of urgency to prey on shoppers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Scams, unfortunately, are nothing new to Australians. Canstar data shows 31 per cent receive at least one scam message a day,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of those who've fallen victim to a scam, 18 per cent have bought from a ghost store, or a seller that didn't exist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKennedy said complaints about ghost stores have increased over the past year, though he notes impersonation scams \u2014 where scammers copy big brands \u2014 are still more likely to flood the market this Black Friday.\n\n\n\nWhat to do if you've been caught by a ghost store?\n\nWhile ghost stores don't typically steal credit card details, consumers can still lose money if they fall for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you suspect you've been scammed, contact your bank to stop the transaction or lodge a claim for a chargeback, Kennedy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut don't bother trying to send poor-quality products back for a refund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You end up losing more money on postage \u2014 the return addresses that ghost stores provide are often unreliable or fake,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What Black Friday sales shopping does to your brain, and how to stay in control\n\nGhost stores may refuse refunds, offer only partial refunds, or ignore complaints entirely, the ACCC warns.\n\n\n\n\n\nLowe encourages consumers to act quickly: \"If something doesn't feel right, stop the contact. If you have paid money, contact your bank as soon as possible and report the matter to [the ACCC's] ScamWatch.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMortimer warns consumers to take extra caution during Black Friday and to resist the urge to impulse buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cautionary note around sales periods is that we're all rushing \u2026 We jump onto these sites, put in our credit card details and our order never turns up because it's a ghost store or the quality is incredibly poor,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hopes have been dashed for an interest rate cut before Christmas after inflation across the 12 months to October jumped 3.8 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in September.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data released on Wednesday found that while inflation remained flat in the month of October, the annualised jump in consumer price index (CPI) was above the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) goal of 2-3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trimmed mean CPI, a measure of underlying inflation that removes the biggest price swings, also rose, from 3.2 to 3.3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomist Shane Oliver said the figures were \"disappointing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was a bit surprised the numbers were so high,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everything is increasing across the board.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest contributing factor to rising inflation was housing inflation, which rose 5.9 per cent, followed by food and non-alcoholic beverages at 3.2 per cent, and recreation and culture, which rose 3.2 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists pointed out that rising housing inflation may have been driven by an increase in electricity over the past 12 months, not just the increased costs of purchasing or renting a home.\n\n\n\nWhat's driving housing inflation\n\nIn October, the federal government expanded its Home Guarantee Scheme, which sought to level the playing field for first-home buyers, offering 5 per cent deposits to eligible Australians. At the time, analysts predicted the scheme could drive up house prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver said it was \"too soon to tell\" whether the scheme had contributed to rising inflation, but warned that we could be seeing early effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen both rents and new dwelling prices edge up. We were seeing a nice downtrend in both, but they now seem to be hooking back up again, and that's certainly a concern,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The basic problem is that we have an ongoing shortage of housing, low vacancy rates, and rapidly rising home prices.\n\n\n\n\"When you've got a lack of supply, then you've got strong levels of demand, you end up with rising prices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut former director of economic research at property advertising firm REA Group, Cameron Kushner, said the scheme was \"unlikely\" to have had an impact on inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was the first month in which the scheme was available, and the CPI only measures purchasing of new homes by owner-occupiers \u2014 I suspect most first home buyers are choosing to purchase established homes,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nHe said monthly housing inflation was low, with a 0.8 per cent fall recorded in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Annual growth in rents and new purchasers by owner-occupiers is lower than a year ago and monthly changes have been steady for some time,\" he said.\n\n\n\nElectricity prices soar\n\nThe ABS \"housing group\" data comprises three elements: the cost of building new dwellings, rents and electricity prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiana Mousina, deputy chief economist at AMP, said while rent and the cost of building new dwellings were \"elevated\", the hike was mostly driven by a 37.1 per cent rise in electricity costs, due to the implementation and then removal of electricity rebates from state and territory governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will even out, but it will take some time,\" Mousina told SBS News.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO As power prices surge, David has found ways to cut running costs by thousands SBS News 05:34 English\n\nKushner also pointed to the take-up of energy rebates in Queensland and Western Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The introduction of and then the removal of energy rebates is really what is driving housing inflation,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCash rate disappointment\n\nData insights director at financial comparison site Canstar, Sally Tindall, said inflation was moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s taken the prospect of another rate cut completely off the table. The Board won\u2019t just dismiss a December cut, it\u2019s unlikely it\u2019ll even entertain the idea,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Consumers were hoping for a bit more relief next year, but this latest CPI read has poured cold water over expectations. If anything, the conversation is now shifting to whether the cutting cycle has already run its course, and potentially, what it would take for the central bank to revert back to hikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While the jump in annual electricity and rent inflation was amplified by the timing of government rebates, once you strip out this volatility, it\u2019s clear these essential costs are still climbing.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the inflation rate was far from the RBA's target between two and three per cent, economists were sure it would not provoke a cash rate increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to think not,\" Oliver said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The figures further reduce the chance of a rate cut, and ensure there's zero chance of a December cut.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we have to wait for the December data to come out in full. I think the economy's recovery will be slower than the RBA is planning for. But that's probably a 2027 story.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This story was produced in collaboration with SBS Arabic.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the end, this is our land, and we must take care of it so that it takes care of us \u2014 and we are a stubborn people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor winemaker Sari Kassis, the anxious uncertainty of tomorrow has become a constant part of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike others in the West Bank, his family's property has become the target of violent Israeli settler attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving from Sydney to his family-run vineyard near Birzeit, north of Ramallah, Sari Kassis returned to the land where his family has been growing grapes since the 1990s and olives for much longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SBS Arabic, Mr Kassis says that a few months ago, Israeli forces in the West Bank announced the creation of a new military security zone in his area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve been suffering for months. A few months ago, we received a letter from the Israeli army informing us that the area had been declared a security zone \u2014 about seven thousand square meters \u2014 which includes our vineyards, agricultural areas, and at the centre of this zone is a new settlement outpost that follows the ideology of Meir Kahane and is supported by the Israeli Minister of Interior. What\u2019s more dangerous is that it also has the backing of the Israeli Minister of Finance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLife as a Palestinian in the West Bank has become even more precarious in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor farmers around the world, forecasting things like the weather can be crucial to a successful yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for farmers in the West Bank, who live under strict and constantly evolving security measures, planning ahead is not so simple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Part of the security zone overlaps with our farms. We are required to obtain a permit from the Israeli army to access these areas, under certain conditions. This law depends entirely on the army\u2019s mood. Some days they see us entering our own land and say nothing. Other days, at any moment, they can block access. You go down not knowing what to expect, unsure of the future. For example, we built a water pool on our land \u2014 the army waited until we invested everything, finished it, and then they came and destroyed it. So you think twice, three times, ten times before planting anything there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the centre of the security zone, members of a violent settler group known as 'Hilltop Youth' set up an illegal outpost.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extremist religious Zionist group, Hilltop Youth follow the teachings of Rabbi Meir Kahane, who taught that all non-Jewish people should be expelled from Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nSanctioned by Australia, the UK and the European Union, Hilltop Youth are known for their violent extremism and attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The outpost consists of about seven or eight young Israeli settlers \u2014 I think the oldest is in his early twenties. Their main goal is to change the balance between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank by forcing Palestinians to flee their farms and lands by any means.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeir Kahane advocated for a strict separation of Jewish and non-Jewish people in Israel and proposed a bill saying that any non-Jew in Israel will be forced into slavery or forcibly deported.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Jerusalem Post*, when Kahane's party was elected in 1984, most of Israeli society was embarrassed by his election and 118 members of the Knesset boycotted him, leaving anytime he spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent decades, his influence has grown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jewish Power party, now a major part of Israel's governing coalition, has been described as a \"legal rendition\" of Kahane's party.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarit Michaeli is the International Director at Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SBS, she says settler attacks are not a fringe phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important that people acknowledge that settler violence isn't just some crazy Hilltop Youth running around setting fire to things. We're talking about a group of people who are acting essentially as the informal arm of the Israeli government. They're supported, they're funded, they get political support and backing from the Israeli government, and they're operating on the ground with impunity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOften masked, armed and travelling in groups, these gangs of men and boys carry out attacks with almost total impunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from Israeli rights group Yesh Din shows that of the 1,701 police investigations into settler attacks in the West Bank between 2005 and 2024, over 93 per cent of cases ended without indictment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarit Michaeli says there is an unspoken understanding that Israeli forces are not expected to intervene in settler violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since the establishment of this government, the way Israel has moved to even in deepen its annexation and also signaled both the Army and the police that law enforcement is not warranted, and on the contrary that they shouldn't protect Palestinians from Israeli settlers, that has really created just an absolute free-for-all, when it comes to total impunity of Israeli perpetrators for virtually any, any type of violence against Palestinians. This includes killing as well as daylight robbery, land theft, terrorizing communities, brutalising them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSari Kassis says if authorities do show up, their response is often slow and apathetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All we can really do is film them \u2014 you take out your phone and just keep recording. They are armed, and they wait for any moment, any excuse to attack you. So you can\u2019t get close \u2014 otherwise you give them a pretext. And this specific group has shot at people before, aside from burning cars, homes, and more. We always record and call the Israeli army, informing them that these people have entered our land and they should come remove them. If they do come, it's usually hours later \u2014 one patrol says a word or two to the settlers and they leave. But of course the damage is done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says the total number of Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces and settlers since October 2023 in the West Bank is now over 1,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, October 2025 saw over 260 settler attacks, an average of eight per day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent briefing, UN Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Ramiz Alakbarov said it was the highest number since monitoring began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The settler violence has reached emergency levels. In October, during the olive harvest season, the UN recorded the highest number of settler attacks on Palestinians since the UN monitoring began, an average of eight per day. The olive harvest is an economic and cultural lifeline. These attacks have injured farmers, destroyed olive trees and decimated livelihoods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter settlers attacked Israeli security forces for dismantling an illegal outpost, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a rebuke of settler attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen criticism of settlers from top Israeli officials is extremely rare.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing international pressure to address violence in the West Bank, Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian says Israel doesn't tolerate the attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAny incidents of lawlessness are dealt with to the full extent of the law. The IDF operates under strict ethical guidelines and international law in Judea and Samaria.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSarit Michaeli says that such condemnations from high level Israeli officials are not followed by meaningful change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When Israeli spokespeople say that this is either a small and unimportant phenomenon or that Israel is doing something to tackle it, they are, they're basically lying, because what Israel is doing is funding, is helping, is enhancing the ability of these settlers, who are organised, who are well established, to do these things, to take these violent actions that we see on a daily basis throughout the West Bank, to simply change irreversibly what we have, you know, the control of the land in reality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a landmark opinion last July, the International Court of Justice declared Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September of 2025, Australia formally recognised Palestinian territories as an independent and sovereign State of Palestine.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Israeli Knesset now passing a draft bill that, if approved, will allow Israelis to purchase land in the occupied West Bank, there are fears of further annexation of Palestinian territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on his family's deep and historic connections to the land, Sari Kassis says leaving is not an option.\n\n\n\n",

It is a direct consequence of the spending spree by the Treasurer Jim Chalmers. And it's also why living standards by the way have fallen more sharply in Australia than in any other advanced economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Treasurer though says today's higher figure doesn't make Australia different to any other country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We won't be taking lectures from the Coalition about responsible economic management. If they'd had their way if they won the election, Australians would be earning less, paying higher income taxes, and there'd be bigger deficits and more debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus says coverage is fully restored after an outage this morning in Melbourne that affected an estimated 14,000 people in Frankston and the Mornington Pensinsula.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus spokeswoman Jane McNamara says all six impacted sites are back online, and the telco does not believe triple zero calls were disrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe telco says an act of vandalism is the reason for the outage - citing photographic evidence of criminals cutting fibre and removing copper from an aerial line.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan has told Sky News she is seeking urgent advice on the situation, because the failure is the fourth time in months there has been a major Optus outage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Clearly, with this particular telecommunications company, this is another incident that is putting great concern in the community about their ability to connect to emergency services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union's highest court has ruled that same-sex marriages must be respected throughout the bloc.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU Court of Justice has delivered the binding ruling at the request of a Polish court handling the case of two men who were married in Berlin in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple had sued after a Polish registry had refused to transcribe their German marriage certificate on the grounds that Polish law does not allow marriage between people of the same sex.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawyer representing the couple, Pawel [ Knut, says the judgement is historic and marks a new beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today's decision by the Court of Justice does not introduce marriage equality in Poland, we need to be clear about that. What it does is require recognition of these foreign marriages so that the spouses can claim the rights and obligations that, under various rulings of international courts, already belong to them. It is the opening of a door, the start of a new chapter in the ongoing struggle for equal rights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nA WARNING THAT THIS STORY CONTAINS CONTENT THAT MAY BE DISTRESSING FOR SOME LISTENERS\n\n\n\n\n\nA mother who murdered her two young children and put their bodies into suitcases in a storage locker has been sentenced to life in prison in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Court Justice Geoffrey Venning says the 45 year old will begin her sentence as a patient in a locked psychiatric facility under New Zealand's compulsory mental health treatment law.\n\n\n\n\n\nHakyung Lee will then return to prison when she is deemed well enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft laws are being introduced into parliament to ban the use of genetic testing in insurance underwriting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current legal framework allow insurers to request and use a life insured\u2019s genetic testing results when considering whether, and on what terms, to offer life insurance to individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Financial Services Minister Daniel Mulino says there have been cases where people are foregoing potentially lifesaving, clinically relevant genetic testing for fear of the negative impacts on policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People getting genetic tests is on the rise. And that is a good thing. Hundreds of thousands of people are currently getting tests. But what we're also aware of is that there are situations in which some people are not getting tested where it could be to their benefit. So we want to make sure that we boost that overall upward trend by taking away any fear that people might have there would be an impact on their life insurance premiums.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new study has revealed why former Liberal and opposition leader Peter Dutton lost the last election.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Election Study has found Peter Dutton was the least popular candidate for prime minister in at least four decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy co-author Ian McAllister says he was the least popular major party leader the AES has ever polled.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nA fifth man has been arrested over an alleged suspicious A-F-L betting ring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 34 year old has been charged by Sports Integrity detectives with 21 counts in relation to gambling on the 2021 and 2022 Brownlow Medal awards.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer AFL umpire Michael Pell is also facing additional accusations.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Prior criticism around the tour\u2019s lack of visuals, structure and outfits are technically warranted \u2013 the stage remains unchanged throughout and Doja wears just one costume. But such simplicity keeps all eyes on the so-called queen of rap-pop, whose exaggerated facial expressions offer all the theatrics needed. And when you aren\u2019t looking at Doja, you\u2019re watching her tiger-striped band, many of whom do the robot or roll around on the floor during instrumental interludes. Loading For someone who\u2019s known for sending the occasional barb to fans online (remember when she told us to \u201cget a job\u201d?), there sure is a lot of love in the room. The crowd \u2013 many of whom are dressed in \u201980s workout gear and inflatable cow costumes \u2013 carry Doja through each track, particularly Take Me Dancing and Boss Bitch, singing so loudly it practically drowns out the backing tracks. This clearly tickles Doja, who smiles ear-to-ear each time she holds the mic out.

It\u2019s a nervy, almost frantic composition, very stark in its arrangement, but with a strange kind of delicacy. Post Hoc by Jo Lloyd. Credit: Georgia Haupt There\u2019s a pleasing sense of return here, since Lloyd also appeared in the inaugural Pieces program 20 years ago. In the decades since, she has emerged as one of her generation\u2019s most prolific, influential and determinedly avant-garde choreographers. Here she works with two recent VCA graduates, Flynn Dakis and Jesper Harrison, who appear small and exposed on the vast UMAC stage. Dressed in bizarre skimpy underwear \u2013 one buttock hanging free \u2013 they skitter across the space like paper scraps.\n\nThey periodically force themselves together, a brief shove-and-grapple that sends them spiralling to the back of the stage. Duane Morrison\u2019s hectic sound design \u2013 full of explosions and muttered curses \u2013 creates a sense of impending disaster. The title means \u201cafter the fact\u201d, and you can imagine the two dancers scurrying through the remnants of Lloyd\u2019s earlier works, quoting stray forms and phrases, before collapsing together in a heap, as if in imitation of all that gets left behind. Hush by Siobhan McKenna. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti Two other works complete the program. The first, Siobhan McKenna\u2019s Hush, neatly demonstrates how not-quite-linguistic vocalisations \u2013 sighs, hums, gasps and other small breathy noises \u2013 operate as meaningful utterances, conveying attitude and affect without words.\n\nThese sounds are bound to physical gestures, which McKenna uses as material for a well-shaped \u2013 if not terribly interesting \u2013 movement score. McKenna is an accomplished choreographer, but in this piece, I think she might have pushed further into the ambiguities and occasional failures of these non-words. The other work, Lip by Jenni Large, is memorable for its costuming, if nothing else. Large herself appears in a scarlet cap-a-pie outfit designed by Jarred Dewey, with suggestive references to Atsuko Kudo, Martin Margiela and those unsettling fantasy figures associated with Eiko Ishioka. Lip by Jenni Large. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti It\u2019s a strong statement of aesthetic preferences \u2013 part cosplay, part fetishwear \u2013 but as a performance, it feels underdone, particularly in its attempt to fold composer Anna Whitaker into the action. The program notes frame the work as a study of revenge cycles, which is plausible: Large is like a spirit of blind red fury, a demon that takes possession of Whitaker. Yet the gradual stripping back of the costume to reveal the real person beneath opens more questions than the piece ultimately resolves.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nMUSIC\n\nDaniel M\u00fcller-Schott with Konstantin Shamray \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, November 25 German cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott has returned to Melbourne, filling Elisabeth Murdoch Hall with the glorious resonance and many-splendoured lyricism of his 1727 \u201cEx Shapiro\u201d Matteo Goffriller cello. Cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott Noting his instrument is almost exactly contemporaneous with Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No. 3 in C major, BWV 1009, M\u00fcller-Schott brought an expansive, larger-than-life feeling to this classic. Like the rest of the suite, the Prelude was flexible yet rhythmic, powered by artistic and technical assurance. Other movements were beautifully characterised, with especially telling contrasts between the sprightly Courante and the intense yet subtly coloured Sarabande, while the well-known Bour\u00e9e and the rustic Gigue were buoyed by joyous rhythmic energy.\n\nTogether with Russian-born, Australian-based pianist Konstantin Shamray, M\u00fcller-Schott offered great insights into Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Sonata in D minor, Op. 40. Once again proving himself to be an extraordinary colourist, M\u00fcller-Schott gave the opening two themes a life of their own, with exchanges between instruments deftly handled. Loading At the centre of the work, the third-movement Largo became a soul-searing expression of heartache. This vividly etched lament was surrounded by remarkable vigour, both in the second-movement Allegro and in the impish finale. Throughout, the artists harnessed Shostakovich\u2019s formidable array of technical demands to memorable musical ends. From the outset, Brahms\u2019 Cello Sonata No. 2 in F major, Op. 99 overflowed with grandeur and ardent passion. Thanks to the superb instrument, the pizzicato in the Adagio had an unusual depth, while the middle section of the Allegro passionato was yet another instance of the cello\u2019s voice taking on an almost-human quality. The cheerful, hope-giving finale set the seal on arguably one of the best concerts of the year. How wonderful to see M\u00fcller-Schott\u2019s generous, open personality and poetic musicianship garner him quite a following of young fans, teeming in the audience and listening with rapt attention.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nCABARET\n\nMeow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMalthouse Theatre, until December 6 The original Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale involves a girl enamoured with a pair of red shoes. As punishment for her vanity, the shoes are cursed, and she\u2019s forced to dance in them forever. Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes is a retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson classic. Credit: Brett Boardman Even when her feet are amputated, the shoes still dance tauntingly before her. Yes, it\u2019s grim, as a lot of these unvarnished fairytales are wont to be, but this is Meow Meow\u2019s Red Shoes, and she has her own ideas about the classic story. It\u2019s the third iteration in her fairytale series, after The Little Matchstick Girl and The Little Mermaid. The show opens on a comic note with the performer (otherwise known as Melissa Madden Gray) being dragged on stage by her legs. This self-confessed \u201ceternal showgirl\u201d has lost her muse; she\u2019s a marionette slackened with existential angst and more attuned to the sorry, lustreless state of the world.\n\nIndeed, Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood with its mountain of debris and a plastic curtain. Meow Meow climbs up and down this graveyard of rubbish, singing and emoting and resplendent in a black mini dress, bouffant hair and even bigger plumed headgear. The musicians (Mark Jones, Dan Witton and Jethro Woodward) are in distressed tuxedoes, and between them play an astonishing array of instruments including piano, guitar, double bass, drums and tuba. Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood. Credit: Brett Boardman Meow Meow\u2019s energy is unflagging: aside from the actual dancing (sometimes lopsidedly with different footwear), she also hops, crawls and does the splits. She can be vulnerable one moment (hobbling around trying to find her missing red shoe), and brazen the next, in an interactive aside with the audience to \u201credistribute the wealth\u201d. There\u2019s a lot going on in this digressive show with its various sprays against communism, capitalism and world greed in general. It\u2019s a springboard of ideas, but it\u2019s difficult to find the skein of narrative about the titular red shoes in between all the play and hijinks.\n\nMeow Meow does challenge Andersen (Kanen Breen) at one point about the fairytale\u2019s punitive corrective against a girl who simply wanted to dance. Maybe dancing isn\u2019t the problem, but the cure? Maybe we need more art in our lives? The ambiguities are open to interpretation. Could Red Shoes also be a self-reflexive comment about diva narcissism seeking external validation or the peripatetic career path of artists?

Credit: Brett Boardman In the movie of The Wizard of Oz, after a series of (mis)adventures, Dorothy\u2019s ruby shoes took her home; in this story they have the opposite effect: they\u2019re a talisman of the dangers of creative ambition, of the neverending desire to prove oneself, even if that aspiration can take you (like Meow Meow\u2019s career) far away from home. For those hoping or expecting linearity and cohesion, you\u2019d leave bewildered with this rag-tag assortment of song, dance and spectacle but if you\u2019re a fan of cabaret with a twist of the absurd, Meow Meow\u2019s charisma and rich honeyed tones, Breen\u2019s operatic tenor, and the trio of musicians provide theatrical ballast.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nMUSIC\n\nRyman Healthcare Spring Gala: Joyce DiDonato \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Symphony Orchestra, Hamer Hall, November 21 Making her first major Australasian tour, American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato confirmed her reputation as one of this generation\u2019s most compelling classical singers in a memorably sophisticated account of Berlioz\u2019 song cycle Nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 (Summer Nights) with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn. American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato performs with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Laura Manariti DiDonato took evident delight in revealing the elegant sensuality and profound emotion flowing from this supreme expression of French romanticism. Charting a journey from innocence through loss to new life, the six songs were a perfect vehicle for her vocal versatility. Keenly alive to musical and textual nuance, DiDonato\u2019s voice of liquid gold brought simple delight to Villanelle, exquisitely contrasted by the ruminative ecstasy of The Spectre of the Rose in which the climactic line, \u201cI come from paradise\u201d was superbly seductive. Contemplating isolation and death, On the Lagoons, Absence and At the Cemetery brought out the alluring, expressive qualities of her lower range, before radiant enthusiasm marked her sailing to The Unknown Isle.\n\nA generous performer, DiDonato offered two encores: a steamy Habanera from Bizet\u2019s Carmen and then, making a link between her native Kansas and the Land of Oz, a heartwarming rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Beginning with Rossini\u2019s William Tell overture may seem hackneyed but the initial rapturous cello solo brilliantly delivered by David Berlin offset the all-too-familiar gallop. Jaime Mart\u00edn conducts the Spring Gala. Credit: Laura Manariti After interval came two-thirds of Respighi\u2019s Roman trilogy: The Fountains of Rome and The Pines of Rome. While the latter undeniably ends in a blaze of glory, such unimaginative programming forfeited the opportunity of introducing a large audience to the least heard and arguably the best of the three suites, The Festivals of Rome. That said, the orchestral playing was consistently engaging and the Berlioz especially was sensitively accompanied. However, the night belonged to DiDonato, who hopefully can dazzle Melbourne again soon.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nPixies \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Festival Hall, November 19 Female bass players are to the Pixies as drummers are to Spinal Tap: they\u2019ve had a lot of them. Kim Deal (1987-2012), Kim Shattuck (briefly in 2013), Paz Lenchantin (2014-2023) have all come and gone. Black Francis of Pixies performs onstage at Festival Hall, November 19, 2025. Credit: Richard Clifford Now it\u2019s Emma Richardson\u2019s turn to provide the driving bass and sweet harmonies that are so crucial to the Boston-born band\u2019s loud-quiet-loud dynamic. And she stands tall, literally and figuratively, towering over frontman Black Francis, guitarist Joey Santiago and drummer Dave Lovering when the four embrace and take a well-earned bow at the end of their blistering 32-song two-hour set on Wednesday night. This is the back-to-back album show, in which the band play Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991) track by track, throwing in a handful of faves at the end for good measure. On this tour, they alternate set lists across two-night engagements, with the second set featuring a best-of collection from across their catalogue, plus some songs from their new album, The Night the Zombies Came.\n\nPixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. As they take the stage \u2013 unadorned, apart from a winged P and four spheres that morph from planets to eyes over the course of the show (nods to the respective albums\u2019 cover art) \u2013 Francis takes a sip from a mug and says \u201chello time travellers\u201d before offering some background on the origins of Cecilia Ann, the opening track on Bossanova (a cover of a Surftones song recorded in 1964 but not released until 1988, its origins are in French composer Gabriel Faure\u2019s Sicilienne \u2026 apparently). It\u2019s the fourth time I\u2019ve seen the Pixies live (the first was at their absolute peak in 1989), and before they\u2019ve played a note, Francis has already said a lot more than in the three other shows combined. Pixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. Credit: Richard Clifford He\u2019s in a good mood, and no wonder. The band is tight as, ripping through songs at a rate of knots. \u201cThank you. The songs are kind of short, I know,\u201d he says at one point. And he\u2019s right. Some barely pass the 90-second mark. His voice is different than it was in 1987, when their debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim blasted onto the world. It\u2019s gruffer, scarred by the screams that litter many tracks, but the counterpoint upper register is still intact. It works.\n\nSantiago\u2019s guitar work is as good as ever, searing, surfy, scintillating, and on Velouria, Allison, Is She Weird and Dig For Fire, the band sounds as good as they ever did. The energy kicks up a notch when they trip into the Trompe set, with barely a pause to note the transition. This is a punkier set of songs, fast and furious, and the crowd becomes more energised as the set wears on. Loading The influence of Pixies, who recorded just four studio albums in their first wave of mutilation before breaking up in 1993 (and another five since reforming in 2004), has been well noted, with Nirvana and Weezer among the many to have paid homage. But on this night, with this set list, the backward lineage was apparent too: a cover of Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On, the aforementioned Surftones track (and a general infusion of surf-guitar sounds throughout), and, in the final bracket of non-album tracks, Neil Young\u2019s Winterlong. It was a welcome reminder that although it sometimes felt like they\u2019d arrived from nowhere \u2013 or, maybe, from outer space \u2013 the Pixies were indeed born of this world. They\u2019re strange, jarring, at times unfathomable, but on this form they remain as vital as ever.\n\nReviewed by Karl Quinn\n\nDANCE\n\nBrigid \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, until November 22 The room fills with haze while the dancers lie prone, hiding their faces. It\u2019s an opening scene that recalls those old images of Celtic romance: an orange twilight glow, frothing vapours and ancient figures half-buried in the earth. Brigid is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name Credit: Agust\u00edn Far\u00edas Brigid, created by Alice Heyward and Ois\u00edn Monaghan, is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name, one of the folk divinities of that legendary age before recorded history \u2013 the imagined time of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. We actually know very little about this daughter of the Dagda. Her story has been partly obscured by the later Saint Brigid of Kildare, the famous abbess and miracle-worker, the so-called Mary of the Gael who turned dirty bathwater into beer.\n\nIn looking back to the older Brigid, Heyward and Monaghan seem to take her obscurity as a cue. This is a work full of uncertainties and strange vacancies amid the rattling, racketing old-style jigging that fills the space. Loading The three performers \u2013 Heyward, Monaghan and Oonagh Slater \u2013 slowly raise themselves. You feel the heaviness of it, the work of dragging something old and earth-loving back into motion. They fall and fall again, landing with real weight. The dancing arrives gradually. At first, they fall into step together: a fleeting suggestion, perhaps, of the goddess\u2019s triple aspect. Then they separate, moving with apparent freedom across the long, windy gap between lights set at either end of the studio. Monaghan\u2019s boots slap the boards like antique flat irons. Or maybe hammers. Is this a vision of Brigid in her role as patroness of blacksmiths? The loud percussive steps follow closely the work of sound designer Gregor Kompar, who also performs live.",

        "text": "Where once Hassett, then regarded as a mainstream economist, advocated a carbon tax on coal and petrol and was pro-immigration and anti-protectionism, now he echoes Trump\u2019s aversion to \u201cgreen\u201d policies (he, too, lambasts wind turbines for killing birds), is an enthusiastic supporter of the administration\u2019s harsh treatment of immigrants and of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Like Bessent, he says an economic bonanza from the whirlwind of the administration\u2019s policies, particularly the tariffs and Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill, with its tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts to health and other services for the not-so-wealthy, is just over the horizon. US government deficits and debt, Hassett has claimed, are declining because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Jerome Powell may make life difficult for Trump by staying on the Fed\u2019s board after his term as chair ends. Credit: AP The deficit has reduced, from $US1.82 trillion ($2.8 trillion) in the 2023-24 financial year under Joe Biden, to $US1.8 trillion. Government debt, however, has risen from $US36.2 trillion at the end of last year to $US38.1 trillion this year and is still climbing, despite the tariff revenues. The administration never lets the facts get in the way of the story.\n\nLoading Hassett fits Trump\u2019s bill for the next chair of the Fed better than any of the other candidates and it will be Trump who makes the final call on who is presented to the Senate for confirmation. That he is favoured by betting markets and Fed watchers and those closest to the administration doesn\u2019t mean his appointment is inevitable, however. As White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said this week: \u201cNo one really knows what President Trump is going to do until he does it.\u201d What we do know is that the next Fed chair will only be chosen if they agree to do what Trump wants, which means he\u2019ll expect them to get the Fed to slash interest rates. He will also want them to shake up the Fed and its processes, which most of the candidates have signalled they would.\n\nWhether they\u2019d be prepared to do to the Fed what the administration has done to other key US agencies like the Department of Justice \u2013 purging the existing staff, replacing them with MAGA people and making it subservient to Trump\u2019s whims \u2013 is a more open question, although Hassett, the closest of the candidates to Trump and the Trumpist agenda, might be more willing to pursue that objective than the others. Powell\u2019s term as the Fed\u2019s chair doesn\u2019t end until next May, but his preferred successor will be nominated well before then \u2013 Bessent has signalled that it will be before the end of the year \u2013 because the administration believes the confirmation process for such a powerful and sensitive position could be protracted. Sharemarkets would welcome Hassett\u2019s appointment but bond investors wouldn\u2019t be quite as enthusiastic. Credit: Bloomberg A chairman-elect, waiting in the wings, could also put pressure on the Fed\u2019s board and members of the 12-person committee that actually sets US monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to fall more into line with Trump\u2019s wishes. Hassett, if he is Trump\u2019s choice, would, of course, be only one of seven Fed governors, albeit the first among equals, and only one of the 12 FOMC\u2019s voting members. (There are another seven regional Fed bank presidents who attend and participate in meetings, but don\u2019t vote.)\n\nThose FOMC members have, unusually for an institution that has generally been consensus-driven, shown increasingly divergent views this year. There is no guarantee that they will fall into line with the new chair\u2019s wishes. Loading It is also possible that the FOMC members might break with the tradition of appointing the Fed\u2019s chair as chair of their committee. They appoint their chair from within their ranks and could vote for someone else, perhaps even Powell. While Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor doesn\u2019t end until 2028. His predecessors have tended to quit the Fed entirely once they have completed their terms at the head of the boardroom table, but there\u2019s no requirement that they do so. Powell hasn\u2019t provided any indication of his intentions but, if he were to hang on, not only would he deny Trump the opportunity to appoint another governor \u2013 the new chair would have to be slotted into the seat being kept warm until February by another Trump loyalist, Stephen Miran \u2013 but there would potentially be a countervailing influence within the Fed and FOMC to Trump\u2019s chair.\n\nThere\u2019s another potential source of opposition. What we do know is that the next Fed chair will only be chosen if they agree to do what Trump wants, which means he\u2019ll expect them to get the Fed to slash interest rates. Sharemarket and crypto investors and the artificial intelligence companies investing increasingly expensive trillions of dollars of capital would love Hassett to be appointed. Lower interest rates are supportive of equity and crypto values. Rates as low as those Trump wants would potentially turbocharge risk assets, boost near-term economic growth and (which is another reason for Trump\u2019s advocacy of slashing rates) significantly lower the interest costs of the US government\u2019s debt. Investors in bonds wouldn\u2019t be quite as enthusiastic. Inflation is their bete noir and slashing rates while the US inflation rate (3 per cent and edging up as the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are starting to show up) is well above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target is a recipe for accelerating inflation.",

        "text": "And all of this is on top of tax increases worth \u00a340 billion in last year\u2019s budget. Labour is making no bones about its targets. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told parliament on Wednesday afternoon (about midnight, AEDT) that she wanted to lift tax rates on income from property, savings and dividends. Loading \u201cI will make further reforms to our tax system today to make it fairer \u2013 and to ensure the wealthiest contribute the most,\u201d she said. The new property tax will hit many parts of London and the wealthier regional cities, where families already struggle to buy a home. The \u201chigh-value council tax surcharge\u201d will start at \u00a32500 per year in England for residential properties worth \u00a32 million or more.\n\nThe benchmark is very high for most workers, but the base level is about the price of a modern three-bedroom flat in Notting Hill or a two-bedroom in Chelsea \u2013 which goes to show that looking for property in fashionable London is only a game for the wealthy. Reeves, again, is unapologetic about making some people pay more. In her budget speech, she said a landlord with income of \u00a325,000 currently pays about \u00a31200 less in tax each year than a tenant who gets the same income as a salary. Does that make her a modern Robin Hood? Not at all. Most workers who pay tax are not getting money back from the government for the simple reason that there is no money to spare. The fact is that Britain\u2019s finances are in a dire state after years of deficits. Despite the tax grabs in this week\u2019s budget, the national debt will be slightly higher as a percentage of the economy than projected in March, says the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). That is partly because the OBR expects the economy to grow more slowly over the next few years, eking out 1.5 per cent a year compared to the earlier outlook for 1.8 per cent.\n\nGloom on the streets The official forecast matches the gloom on the streets, where small stores complain about shoplifting. While the restaurants are full in the glitzier parts of London, things are quieter in areas where tourists do not roam. Britain\u2019s net financial debt will reach \u00a32.6 trillion this year \u2013 and Reeves is warning that 10 per cent of government spending now goes on the interest bill. In Australia, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the bill is 3.6 per cent of outlays. This highlights a far more dangerous dynamic for Britain than Australia. Put simply, the markets are dictating terms to London in a way Canberra is yet to see. The more Britain borrows, the edgier the markets get. Liz Truss resigned after just 49 days in office, making her Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister. Credit: Bloomberg\n\nWhile Australia has an AAA credit rating, the UK is considered AA and has a troubled history with the markets. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, as prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, triggered a crisis in October 2022 with their budget plans; both were gone soon afterwards. Reeves could not keep the markets calm without her tax hikes. She could, in theory, slash spending, but the Labour backbench is already restive about the leadership and rebelled against welfare cuts in July. It wanted more spending on welfare, not less. Starmer and Reeves chose not to argue. And this produced the big winners on budget day: families on income support with more than two children. The Conservatives stopped families getting benefits for more than their second child, but Labour will reinstate the old regime. Low-income families will receive more money for their children, funded by higher taxes on workers. Reeves says she is proud to be acting on child poverty, but the debate will grow about the scale of the tax burden and the size of the welfare state. If productivity is lower than the government assumes, the deficits will continue for the decade ahead. And the fact is that British productivity is in the doldrums.\n\nIn the end, the markets seemed to welcome the new plan. The pound rose against the US dollar and the euro. The borrowing costs on British government bonds fell. This was the most important reaction to the budget, given the size of the British debt, but it has no visibility for most of the British media or the public. The run-up to the budget has been dominated by ferocious complaints about tax increases and spending cuts, with scant mention of the size of the interest bill on years of carefree borrowing. Reeves had a glowing forecast for parliament. She said the deficit would be \u00a328.8bn in 2026-27 and then shrink to \u00a34.6 billion the following year. By the subsequent year, she said, Britain would be posting a \u00a33.9 billion surplus, with much bigger ones after that. The forecasts, of course, hardly ever turn out to be true. There is a warning in the analysis from the independent OBR about how it could all go wrong. If productivity is lower than the government assumes, the deficits will continue for the decade ahead. And the fact is that British productivity is in the doldrums. Starmer and Reeves need an economic revival to deliver the budget recovery they promise. The soundtrack to their budget comes from Dusty Springfield, who lived near Notting Hill in the days it was affordable: wishing and a-hoping.",

        "text": "The Coalition has lashed the government\u2019s negotiation tactics after Labor struck a last-minute deal with the Greens to pass historic changes to Australia\u2019s environmental laws.\n\nAmendments to the government\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will receive the support of the Greens in the Senate, Environment Minister Murray Watt confirmed on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThese reforms will deliver a modern, fit for purpose set of national environmental laws for Australia for a long time to come,\u201d Mr Watt said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAlongside Mr Watt, Anthony Albanese confirmed crucial changes in the EPBC Act would include the establishment of a federal environmental protection agency, national environmental standards, and higher penalties for the most significant breaches of environmental law.\n\nThe Bill will pass on the last sitting day of the year.\n\nHowever, Sussan Ley criticised the Bill being pushed out on the final day of parliament and hit out at the Prime Minister for a \u201clack of good faith negotiations\u201d with the Coalition.\n\nSussan Ley criticised the EPBC Act changes, describing it as a \u2018bad Bill\u2019. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nAside from the Greens, the Coalition was the other contender to lock in a deal that would pass the EPBC Act changes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThere actually was no rush to get this done today, and that\u2019s because, in my view, the Labor Party never wanted to do any deal with us,\u201d Ms Ley said.\n\n\u201cThey wanted the optics of concluding something, anything on the last sitting day, to cover up their massive, massive failures in terms of the energy projects.\u201d\n\nMs Ley further criticised the deal and claimed it was rushed to pass before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI come back to the point about the lack of good faith in negotiations because we know that this could have gone into next year,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe could have all taken the time to get it right, and the evidence is what you see before you: a dirty deal done with the Greens party.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAny deal done with the Greens that involves our industries that make our country strong, that pay our bills, is not going to be in their interests.\u201d\n\nAs part of working towards a deal, the Coalition provided a list of seven issues with the prospective changes to the EPBC Act \u2013 several of these issues were highlighted as areas of improvement in Labor\u2019s announcement earlier that morning.\n\nThe deal means Australia\u2019s environmental laws will be overhauled. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nAsked whether the Coalition should have conceded to strike a deal, Ms Ley said: \u201cIndustry and ourselves were on the same page.\n\n\u201cNow there were seven critical areas, and the fact that the government might have come halfway to meeting half of the things that we wanted them to is not addressing the problem here, which is that this is a bad Bill operating against the interests of industry and business in Australia.\u201d\n\n$300m forestry fund\n\nMr Albanese also announced Labor would establish a $300m forestry growth fund to back forestry and timber workers.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201c(It will) deliver a bigger forestry industry that supports more secure jobs, better pay and high value output,\u201d he said.\n\nFor business, Mr Watt said the reforms would respond to the community\u2019s major requests, \u201cwhich are all designed to speed up decision making and lift productivity by getting business faster yeses and faster nos\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese reforms include a new, streamlined assessment pathway to significantly reduce the time frame for proponents who provide sufficient information upfront, new and improved bilateral agreements with states and territories to remove duplication for the assessment and approval of projects,\u201d he said.\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt confirmed a deal had been struck. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nDespite receiving support from the Greens, Mr Albanese said he still hoped the Coalition would back the Bill but expressed frustration with negotiations with the opposition.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe problem that we have with the Coalition was that their final letters had in it \u2018and there are other things to come\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow, parliament stops today.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, the day, before parliament say, \u2018Oh, well, we\u2019ve got some other things, but we can\u2019t tell you what they are yet\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt made it impossible.\u201d\n\nMr Albanese said Coalition amendments that were \u201cstraight from the business community\u201d had been adopted, including more clarity on the definitions of net gain and unacceptable impacts.\n\nOpposition environment spokeswoman Angie Bell led the Coalition\u2019s case on the EPBC changes. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nHe said the Greens \u201cshowed maturity\u201d in terms of the \u201cthings they want (that) they didn\u2019t get\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of things we put forward that I said were not negotiable \u2026 And I must say that the Greens were very constructive in those negotiations yesterday, and I thank them for it,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the laws are now set to pass, Mr Watt was grilled by reporters on the longevity of the legislation \u2013 namely, under a prospective Coalition government.\n\nAsked whether he was concerned the decision to go with the Greens could threaten the lifespan of the new laws, Mr Watt said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\n\n\u201cI have made the point that there were some benefits in being able to reach a deal with the Coalition in terms of the enduring nature of the reforms.\n\n\u201cBut as all of you can see, every single day for Coalition is a shambles and they\u2019ve been a shambles on these negotiations as well.\n\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t strike a deal with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they want.\u201d",
