        "text": "P\ufeffeople who are blind or have low vision are calling for rideshare services such as Uber to be included in taxi subsidy schemes across the country.\n\nState governments subsidise taxi services for people with eligible disabilities, via a special card or voucher that they show the driver, which reduces the cost of each trip.\n\nCurrently, Victoria is the only state that includes rideshare services in its scheme, allowing members to link their membership to their Uber account since 2021.\ufeff\n\nCaitlin McMorrow is blind and uses a guide dog. She has been forced to cancel medical appointments when taxis simply don't show up. (Supplied)\n\nCaitlin McMorrow, who lives in Redland City north of Brisbane, is totally blind and travels with a guide dog.\n\nShe said she's been forced to cancel medical appointments and social events when her taxi simply didn't show up.\n\n\"There's nothing more stressful than booking an appointment or having a social event planned, and then kind of constantly having that thought in the back of your mind of, 'Am I actually gonna be able to get there and get home again?' which is kind of where we're at with transport in Brisbane at the moment, it just isn't reliable,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"(With rideshare) you can see exactly where the vehicle is, you've got that kind of real-time communication with the driver, the payment system's all sort of done through the app.\n\n\"You can book an Uber and get one within four or five minutes.\n\n\"It's common that the taxi booking system will sit there for 45 minutes and still not find you one.\n\n\"That's a big difference when you're trying to be a busy, productive member of the community, I guess, and get your stuff done.\"\n\nAccording to Vision Australia, the NDIS guidelines around transport funding are inconsistently interpreted and many of its clients receive no funding.\n\nIt's also capped at $3500 a year, whereas taxi subsidy schemes are not.\ufeff\n\nBruce Maguire, Vision Australia's lead policy advisor, who lives in New South Wales, said he found rideshare \"more straightforward and less stressful\".\n\n\"As a blind person, when I get into a taxi I don't know what is going on the meter because we don't have talking taxi meters in New South Wales, so I have to take the driver's word for it,\" he said.\n\n\"And if I forget to tell him that I'm going to use the taxi transport subsidy and he doesn't turn the meter on, then I can't use it.\n\n\"You don't have any of those sorts of issues with rideshare.\n\n\"You can enjoy the trip and enjoy getting to your destination without that stress of wondering what's going to happen and what the fare might be and whether you're being told the correct meter amount and even whether the driver can accept the (subsidy) card or not.\"\n\nBruce Maguire, lead policy advisor for Vision Australia, wants to see rideshare services included in taxi subsidy schemes nationally. (Supplied)\n\nNational survey data from Vision Australia showed 59 per cent of respondents believed they would be more likely to use the scheme if it were expanded to rideshare.\n\nVision Australia general manager for corporate affairs and advocacy Chris Edwards said the survey reveals an urgent need for transport policy reform.\n\n\"For people who are blind or have low vision, accessible transport is not a luxury, it's an essential.\n\n\"We're not saying that rideshare services are perfect, for example we're continuing to work with the sector around the issue of dog guide refusals, but we believe states expanding their subsidy schemes to rideshare providers would have a significant benefit for our community.\"\n\nFor McMorrow, rideshare is as close as it gets to being able to jump in the car like a sighted person.\n\n\"As a blind person, I just want the same access to transport and to services that everybody else has,\" she said.\ufeff\n\n\"I think it's a reasonably simple thing that the government could do that would really improve choice of transport and access and consequently, quality of life, for vision-impaired people such as myself.\"\n\nIn a statement, Uber said it supports a \"\ufeffprovider-neutral approach to taxi subsidy schemes across Australia\".\n\n\"Accessible and flexible transport is key to helping people with disabilities stay active, independent and connected.\n\n\"Since 2021, MPTP members in Victoria have experienced the benefits of subsidised Uber rides.\n\n\"We will continue to engage with advocacy groups and state governments to expand access to rideshare within government subsidy programs nationwide.\"\n\nA spokesman said Uber is conducting a 12-week T\ufeffransport Subsidy Trial, with assistance from Vision Australia and Disability Voices Tasmania.\n\n\"We're offering people with disabilities the equivalent subsidy they'd receive through government schemes to use on the Uber platform, unlocking greater access to transportation options.\n\n\"We welcome more organisations across Australia to join the trial to help expand transport access for people with disabilities.\"",

        "text": "A payments expert has watered down fears the Reserve Bank's proposed ban on card surcharges and accompanying cap on interchange fees will force banks to roll back credit card perks like frequent flyer points.\n\nThe RBA's consultation paper on surcharges suggests capping the maximum interchange fee banks and service providers charge for card transactions.\n\nIt said the current fees paid by businesses to card providers are \"too high\".\ufeff\n\nThe RBA proposed a cap for interchange fees after claiming the current ones are \"too high\". (Nine/The Age)\n\nThose fees\ufeff form large parts of bank and card provider revenue streams and pay for credit card perks like frequent flyer points.\n\nThe rewards are incredibly popular \u2013 more than a third of credit card spending in Australia is done on Qantas frequent flyer points-earning cards alone, according to the airline.\n\nThe RBA itself warned the programs could be scaled back in response to an interchange fee cap, which could deliver a hit of almost $1 billion.\n\nIt is important to note that American Express credit cards do not fall under the RBA's remit and won't be impacted.\ufeff\n\n\"Issuers are expected to experience a reduction in interchange revenue of around $900 million under the preferred package and $800 million under the alternate option,\" its consultation paper states.\n\n\"Some issuers may choose to increase cardholder fees or reduce benefits such as rewards points, particularly on credit cards, to boost their profitability in response to reductions in interchange settings,\" it adds.\n\nPayment Services managing director Brad Kelly told 9news.com.au the interchange fee is the \"holy grail\" for financial institutions.\n\nHe said the proposed cap could have a flow-on impact for customers but doesn't expect perks like Qantas points will be stripped back.\n\n\"What it will mean is that revenue bucket is just not big enough anymore to pay for rewards, so they're going to have to work out a different way to pay for it,\" Kelly explained.\n\n\"Potentially what will happen is is that rewards cards will evolve. It's not the end of frequent flyer points on rewards cards. Far from it.\"\n\nKelly said reward points may be offered to customers directly via merchants instead.\n\nBecause this, it could result in increased competition and better perks for spending money on credit cards.\n\n\"The customer could be better off,\" Kelly said.\n\nMoney saving expert Joel Gibson said rewards perks are often overvalued. (Today Extra)\n\n\"I also think there's opportunity for alternatives, where you still get your rewards per spend, but it's handled differently.\"\n\nMoney saving expert Joel Gibson said customers shouldn't be wary of losing perks.\n\nInstead, he warned other key features like scam protection could be impacted.\ufeff\n\n\"Reducing fraud protection would be a serious downside, for example,\" he said.\n\n\"But reducing the value of rewards programs would probably leave most people better off in my view.\"\n\nGibson said the average punter overvalues rewards.\n\nThe average credit limit in Australia is $10,439,\ufeff which isn't a lot if you're hoping to score business-class flights on points alone.\n\n\"Most of us pay more in annual fees, merchant fees and interest than we get back in points, even if we don't realise it,\" he said.\n\n\"And most of us have no idea what a point is worth and the rewards programs make it hard to work out by giving them different values for different purchases.\"\n\nNone of the major banks approached by 9news.com.au said whether or not they are considering reducing card perks in response to the RBA reforms.\n\nIt has been suggested Apple Pay may be under threat if the surcharge ban goes ahead.\n\nAt least one major bank is considering pulling the pin on Apple Pay, the Australian Financial Review reported this month.\n\nKelly said banks won't pull the pin on Apple Pay. (Getty)\n\nKelly said he doubts any bank would risk such a huge chunk of their transactions.\n\n\"\ufeffApple Pay now represents about 40 per cent of card payments in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no way [a bank] would switch off 40 per cent of its payment traffic.\"\n\nA feedback window on the RBA's proposals is open until August 26 this year, before the reforms are finalised.\n\nThey are scheduled to come into effect next July.\ufeff\n\nThere is a \ufeffchance the surcharge fee ban could be passed onto customers, some business owners have warned.\n\nThe RBA has also proposed more transparency around fees by requiring providers to display their wholesale charges clearly.\n\n9news.com.au has contacted the Australian Banking Association for comment.\ufeff",

(ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"The others said, 'Your father's going to retire and you got no job, you got the shop there, how about changing it to the restaurant?'\" Ms Yu said.\n\nThe first English phrase Ms Yu learnt was \"What would you like?\" as she served behind the till and waited on tables.\n\nHistorical documents and photos were displayed in the restaurant when it was opened. (ABC Kimbereley: Ruby Littler)\n\nSon Ming became more than a place to eat, evolving into a gathering spot, a museum, and a living archive of Chinese-Australian history in Broome.\n\n\"I wanted people to know the Broome Chinese community had been here for a long time,\" Ms Yu said.\n\nAccidental fire\n\nBut after decades of service, a kitchen fire led to the restaurant's closure.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn late June, two people passing by jumped into action upon seeing smoke coming from the restaurant's kitchen.\n\nWhile the blaze was contained to the kitchen, sparing the rest of the property, Ms Yu said the incident was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\n\"Suddenly, accidentally, by fire, the kitchen burned down, so we need to shut down,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't pay for it to be fixed.\"\n\nMulticultural roots\n\nThe closure represents a loss for Broome, a town with deep multicultural roots dating back to the late 1800s when the pearling industry drew people from China, Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\n\nEuropean pearling masters successfully lobbied for Broome to be exempt from the White Australia Policy, creating a thriving multicultural community on the shores of Roebuck Bay.\n\nBroome had a majority Asian population for much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nBroome's iconic Chinatown strip in the early 1900s.

(ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"Inside the store, they had so many things on their walls depicting Chinese society living in Broome,\" he said.\n\n\" It'll be quite a sad loss for the history of Chinatown when they close down completely. \"\n\nMr Fong said he feared people would forget the culture that gave the town its prominence, with younger generations moving away for work and education opportunities.\n\n\"Broome being such a multicultural town, we need to be part of keeping that attitude going,\" he said.\n\nHis wife Margaret said the closure felt like a piece of the town's Chinese history was \"disappearing\".\n\nMs Yu will continue as chairperson of the Chinese Community group, but said she was unsure what the future held after the restaurant closed.",

(Reuters: Issei Kato)\n\nAccording to Professor Teramura, companies like Client Partners demonstrated the growing need for \"social innovation that combines caregiving, community, and employment\".\n\n\"Contributing to society through life experience, emotional labour, and communication skills can provide purpose and income for older women,\" she said.\n\nOECD economists have warned that the decline in the working-age population in Japan could impact its economic growth.\n\nJapan's Sanseito party surges with anti-foreigner election win Photo shows A crowd of men and women, some with Japanese flags. The once fringe Sanseito has become the fourth largest opposition party in parliament by pushing a nationalist \"Japanese First\" agenda.\n\nTo counter this, they have recommended closing the gender gap in employment and increasing immigration.\n\nThe Japanese government has made some efforts to address these labour gender disparities.\n\nA recent amendment to the Promotion of Women\u2019s Active Engagement in Professional Life Act will force companies to be transparent about their gender pay gap, as well as their share of women in managerial positions, from April 2026.\n\nMs Kanazawa said working with her older colleagues has made her optimistic about Japan's future.",

        "text": "The Australian Council of Trade Unions will call for bold changes to negative gearing and the capital gains tax at the government's productivity roundtable this month, arguing the tax breaks be limited to one investment property.\n\nUnder the proposal, the current arrangements would continue for five years to allow investors time to rethink their portfolios before the changes come into force.\n\nThe issue is politically fraught for Labor, who took reforms to negative gearing and capital gains to the 2016 and 2019 federal elections and lost.\n\nBut ACTU secretary Sally McManus told ABC's Insiders it was time to \"bite the bullet\".\n\n\"Otherwise, we're just saying 'too bad young people, you're not going to be able to ever own a home',\" she said.\n\n\"Since 2019, the problem has just got worse. It's going to continue to get worse unless the government is brave enough to do something about it.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nNegative gearing refers to a policy that allows investment property owners to deduct losses from rental properties from their overall taxable income, while the capital gains tax discount lowers the rate of tax paid when houses and shares are sold.\n\nNearly half of all Australian landlords had negatively geared properties, according to figures released in December, with the highest earners hauling in tens of billions of dollars from tax concessions and loopholes.\n\nThe ACTU's proposal would raise about $1.5 billion in tax revenue each year, according to Ms McManus, who added that those with investment properties would have time to adjust their portfolios.\n\n\"Part of the problem is that we've been keeping a whole lot of capital in housing. And it's not those people's fault. They've done that because it has worked for them and they've made smart decisions around that,\" she said.\n\n\"But it's also meant that capital is not being invested in areas that are going to increase productivity, like Australian businesses and other ways that it can be invested.\"\n\nWe're talking about negative gearing again, but why is it such a big deal? Photo shows Houses under construction on a bright, sunny day The policy that just won't quit is back. Will Labor revisit its 2016 and 2019 election policies?\n\nAhead of this year's election, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hosed down speculation Labor was planning to scale back the tax breaks after it emerged that Treasurer Jim Chalmers requested his department to model the impact of changes to the concessions.\n\nAsked if he would rule out future changes to the policies in April, Mr Albanese said: \"I've done that multiple times ... and if you ask me tomorrow, we'll get the same answer.\"\n\nMs McManus did not divulge whether she believed the government, after its landslide victory earlier this year, would back the proposal but stressed that the union would \"go and argue it\".\n\n\"In the end, the government will make their decisions based on what they think is in the national interest. We would say that it is in the national interest,\" she said.\n\nThe union \u2014 which represents about 1.8 million workers \u2014 will also propose a 25 per cent minimum tax rate for people who earn over $1 million, which would also apply to family trusts.\n\nIt will also argue for a new export levy of 25 per cent of the revenue from the sale of liquified natural gas, instead of the current Petroleum Resource Rent Tax on oil and gas exploration.\n\nMr Chalmers has signalled he will use the three-day roundtable to seek new economic reforms, prioritising \"consensus\" among unions, business and economists.\n\nHe has said he wants any reform proposals brought to the roundtable to be budget neutral or budget positive but that all ideas are on the table.\n\nEarlier this week, the Productivity Commission released the first of several reports requested by Mr Chalmers in the lead-up to the roundtable, in which it called for a 20 per cent tax rate on profits for companies with revenue of up to $1 billion.\n\nThat would represent a significant cut for all but the largest companies from the current rate, which is 25 per cent for companies with turnover under $50 million and 30 per cent for all others.\n\nIt also called for a new 5 per cent tax on net cashflow rather than profits, which could see some large companies pay a higher rate but would provide immediate tax relief for smaller companies seeking to build their capital.",

        "text": "Across Western Australia, ambulances spent more than 7,000 hours parked outside the state's hospitals last month.\n\nThat figure breaks all previous records \u2014 even those set during the height of COVID.\n\nIt goes without saying, that's a big problem.\n\nThose ambulance crews aren't on the road answering other calls, and patients are receiving less-than-ideal care.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the behemoth that is Western Australia's health system, it is also a symptom of much deeper problems, according to experts.\n\nThe first problem is the state does not have enough hospital beds to meet demand.\n\nOn the most recent data (up to mid-2023) Western Australia had the second-lowest rate of hospital beds based on population out of all states and territories.\n\nFor comparison, if WA had the same ratio of beds per person as the highest state \u2013 Tasmania \u2013 it would have had an extra 1,500 or so places.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve delivered over 900 beds to the hospital system since 2021, we\u2019ve increased staff by 30 per cent and we\u2019re looking at innovative ways that we can deliver care,\u201d Health Minister Meredith Hammat said on Friday.\n\nMeredith Hammat says the government is attacking the problem from all angles. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nBut the state still needed \u201cat least 1,000 more beds\u201d, according to the Australian Medical Association.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we need more beds. We need more capacity in our health system. It really can\u2019t get any simpler than that,\u201d WA President Kyle Hoath said.\n\nThose beds can take a long time to build and bring online \u2013 not the solution you want in the middle of an immediate crisis.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem, the government says, of too many beds being taken up by people who could be in aged care.\n\nBut solving the problems in that sector is not quick or straightforward, either.\n\nSpare capacity\n\nDr Hoath\u2019s solution was to look to private hospitals and medi-hotels, where he said there was spare capacity.\n\n\u201cThere are beds there that could be used as hospital beds and we need to take advantage of that,\u201d he said.\n\nKyle Hoath says the main problem is a lack of beds. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nMs Hammat wasn\u2019t giving away whether she thought that was a good idea though.\n\n\"We're looking at everything we can do, we're attacking it from every angle,\" she said.\n\nIt was a similar answer she gave to almost every question \u2013 repeating that phrase 17 times in about 14 minutes while offering no new ideas on how to tackle the problem.\n\nIncreased load\n\nThe second problem ramping reveals, according to Dr Hoath, is that the hospital system does not have the capacity to handle the increased load of serious illness presenting to emergency departments.\n\nFamily details tragedy of little girl who died from flu Photo shows A black and white photo of a toddler with a computerised image of a frame and daisies Experts urge people to get vaccinated against the flu, after the death of a little girl from the virus in Perth.\n\nIn responding to the grim total, Ms Hammat pointed to the government\u2019s efforts to divert people away from hospitals as a success.\n\nThe minister singled out the Virtual Emergency Department program, which connects patients with doctors before they reach hospital.\n\nShe said a trial of the program enabled 74 per cent of people who called for an ambulance to receive care without going to an emergency department.\n\nThat could help explain why the number of semi-urgent and non-urgent cases in WA\u2019s emergency departments reduced by about 10 per cent between 2020-21 and 2023-24.\n\nBut it was not enough to offset a 15 per cent increase in the two most serious categories \u2013 resuscitation and emergency \u2013 over that same period.\n\n\u201cWhere people may have presented with severe diabetes in the past, they\u2019re now presenting in renal failure and needing a transplant,\u201d Dr Hoath said.\n\n\u201cPeople are more unwell because they\u2019re not getting the care they need at the right time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a tricky problem to solve but would likely be helped in the long run by increased bulk billing rates \u2013 which the federal government could face an uphill battle to do \u2013 and more care in the community, rather than in hospitals.\n\nBut that\u2019s also much easier said than done.\n\n'Think about health'\n\nThe opposition was squeezing the terrible report card on WA\u2019s health system for every political point it could on Friday.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t build race tracks, don\u2019t build movie studios, don\u2019t do those other things,\u201d leader Basil Zempilas said.\n\nBasil Zempilas has called on the government to make health its focus. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\u201cMy strongest advice for the premier would be: make it your number-one focus.\n\n\u201cThat means every day when you get up, and you drive up from Kwinana, don\u2019t think about other projects.\n\n\u201cThink about health. Make that your job, your responsibility, until the people of Western Australia know that ambulance ramping is on the way down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an idea many would challenge. Governments can, and do, handle doing many things at the same time, while prioritising some issues over others.\n\nBut shadow health spokesperson Libby Mettam made a point many would agree with.\n\n\u201cHow is it in a state as wealthy as Western Australia that we have such a crumbling health system?\u201d she asked.\n\nNo quick fixes\n\nThe answer is there\u2019s no simple answer.\n\nBuilding a health system which can meet the growing demands of a rapidly aging population is one of the most wicked problems governments across Australia face.\n\nHave something to share with the ABC's WA newsroom? Photo shows Perth City and Claisebrook Cove Whether it's an image, video, story, or tip-off, you can send it to the ABC's West Australian newsroom here.\n\nAdd in a worse-than-usual flu season with low vaccination rates and there\u2019s little surprise hospitals are so full.\n\nEarlier last week, having investigated the deaths of three people who passed away while ramped, a South Australian Coroner called on that state\u2019s government to acknowledge ramping is \u201ca reality that all modern healthcare systems encounter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile efforts to reduce the levels of ramping remain extremely important, efforts must also be made to make the process of ramping safer for those patients who will inevitably experience it,\u201d Acting Deputy State Coroner Ian White concluded.\n\nThat might be an unpalatable answer for many.\n\nBut if growing demand for healthcare continues to massively outstrip government\u2019s ability to meet it, that focus might make the best of a bad situation until the effects of wider reforms start to be felt.\n\nLoading...",

(ABC Landline: Chris Lewis)\n\n\"It's embarrassing to have a jetty that people can't walk out and actually walk over water,\" he said.\n\n\"We just want our jetty back \u2014 to be able to use it.\n\n\" It's very frustrating for the locals because my children enjoyed fishing and swimming and jumping off the jetty. My grandchildren can't. \"\n\nA moment frozen in time of when the jetty was well used. (Supplied: Clara Harris)\n\nFrustration grows with sand\n\nIt has been 14 years since commercial fishers like Mr Suckling and his mate Greg Horsman have been able to tie up to the jetty to unload their catches.\n\nCray fishers now have to bring their catch in by dinghy and transfer it to the truck. (ABC Landline: Chris Lewis)\n\nInstead, the lobster fishers are forced to use dinghies to ferry catch and bait to and from their boats and the beach.\n\n\"This jetty had more than 2 metres of water around it, back to approximately halfway along the first leg of the jetty,\" Mr Horsman said.\n\nWith the jetty no longer accessible, cray fishers load and unload their catch and supplies by dinghy. (ABC Landline: Jo Prendergast)\n\n\" It was used by between five and seven boats most of the year, plus we had a few boats that had come in to get fuel or seek shelter. \"\n\nThe pair was frustrated with the WA government, which owned the jetty, for not acting on their calls for help.\n\n\"It's ridiculous. You can't leave it as it is. They [should] either remove it or fix it,\" Mr Horsman said.\n\n\"The longer it goes, the more costly it's going to become. So it should have been looked at possibly 10 years ago, rather than now.\"\n\nWhile some beaches are eroding, the bay at Port Gregory has been filling up with sand. (ABC Landline: Chris Lewis)\n\nMore than a toilet stop\n\nOnce a key fishing port along the coast north of Perth, Port Gregory is now a much smaller village.\n\nThe pink lake on the outskirts of town attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\nOften, they visit Port Gregory as a toilet stop.\n\nThe iconic pink lake near Port Gregory draws crowds of international visitors all year round. (ABC Landline: Chris Lewis)\n\nMs Schultz said the government needed to consider the volume of travellers who visited the pink lake.\n\n\"We do have tourism here; we had 450,000 tourists through,\" she said.\n\n\"They all get out and come for a wander, but they wander onto a weeded-up boardwalk at the moment.\"\n\nVisitors, especially from China, are drawn to the pink lake\u2019s striking colour. (ABC Landline: Chris Lewis)\n\nIn 2021, WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti promised to visit the jetty.\n\n\"To my knowledge \u2026 she hasn't been here,\" Mr Suckling said.\n\nThe minister was unavailable to speak to the ABC and referred questions about the jetty to the Department of Transport.\n\nThough Port Gregory is a small coastal town, it neighbours a world-famous attraction, the pink lake. (ABC Landline: Chris Lewis)\n\nA spokesperson said sedimentation at Port Gregory had been monitored since 2012, and the coastline was continually growing.\n\n\"Options such as dredging and a jetty extension have been considered, however, due to the rapid rate of siltation at Port Gregory, neither of these options is viable,\" the statement said.\n\n\"There are no plans to upgrade the jetty at Port Gregory.\"",

(Getty Images: Ben Whitley/PA Images)\n\nMohammed Siraj clean bowled Zak Crawley for 14 with a searing yorker from the last ball of the day, leaving Ben Duckett on 34 not out at the other end.\n\nEarlier, the left-handed Jaiswal turned his 127th ball of the innings to point and was celebrating his hundred before he ran the single he needed; leaping, running and shaping his fingers into a heart.\n\n\"I had to work really hard in my practice session,\" Jaiswal said.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'one last push.' I think overall, wherever you play, it is difficult in England. It is not easy on this wicket. We are really confident. We will try our best and see what happens.\"\n\nThere were also important contributions for India from Akash Deep, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar.\n\nNightwatchman Deep cut loose for a career-best 66 in a 107-run stand with Jaiswal for the third wicket. Jadeja continued his excellent batting form in the series with 53 and Sundar delivered a swashbuckling 53 off 46 balls at the end of the innings that included four sixes.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nIndia captain Shubman Gill only made 11 but he finished with a tally of 754 runs for the series, passing Graham Gooch's 752 in 1990 for the most by any batter in an India-England series.\n\nEngland did its best to help out India in the field, dropping six catches in all, the team's most in a home test since 2006 when it spilled six against Pakistan, also at The Oval.\n\nThe home side's depleted pace attack toiled hard all day in the absence of the experienced Chris Woakes, who sustained a bad shoulder injury on day one.\n\nJosh Tongue was the pick of the England attack with 5-125, while fellow fast bowler Gus Atkinson took 3-127 to follow up his five-wicket haul from the first innings.\n\n\"It will be a great day of cricket tomorrow, and a great day for us if we get the runs.\" Tongue said.\n\n\"The batting line-up we have is unbelievable. If we can build partnerships, who knows where we might be? Fingers crossed I am not required, but if it comes down to me at the end I will give it a good crack.\"\n\nEngland, which leads the series 2-1, chased down 371 to beat India in the first test at Leeds.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "The wet, wintry days are in full swing in southern Australia and truffle hunting season is well underway.\n\nAustralia is now the fourth-largest truffle producer in the world, exporting more than 11 tonnes valued at $9 million in 2023.\n\nThe demand for the expensive but flavoursome fungus continues to rise but growers and wholesalers are concerned consumers do not know what truffles really taste like.\n\nAustralia has become the fourth-largest producer of truffles in the world. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nSniffing out the truffles\n\nIn the Strathbogie ranges in north-east Victoria, basenji dogs Audrey and Winnie are busy sniffing the ground in search of truffle in exchange for a treat.\n\nDavid and Kate McConnell started growing truffles in 2007 after planting an orchard of oak trees.\n\nAudrey the basenji dog sniffs a truffle. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nThe couple said the rise of synthetic truffle flavour is worrying, considering how much work goes into producing the fungus.\n\n\"It's something that's a concern from a marketing perspective, definitely,\" Mr McConnell said.\n\n\"The idea is to promote more enjoyment in actually experiencing a real truffle, which is what we try to do.\"\n\nSimon Friend grades and sells truffles out of Melbourne and said alarm bells go off in his mind when people describe the flavour as \"strong\".\n\n\"As soon as I hear that my initial thought is that they haven't had any real truffle experience,\" Mr Friend said.\n\nSimon Friend sorts the truffles before selling them on to restaurants in Australia and overseas. (Supplied: Simon Friend)\n\nHe is worried people who have tasted synthetic truffle flavour do not know that it is different to a fresh truffle.\n\n\"It's a misnomer,\" Mr Friend said.\n\n\"There's no real truffle in truffle oil. People don't know that they are actually experiencing a synthetic flavour.\n\n\" It's a huge disappointment to me. It has a negative impact on the industry as you're training people on an unauthentic flavour. \"\n\nTruffle oils are typically made by infusing a flavour often referred to on the bottle as an \"aroma\" or \"essence\".\n\nThere are no laws in Australia around the use of synthetic flavours in products, but Mr Friend is worried that consumers are being misled.\n\n\"It's the same with vanilla in a huge way. Caviar, and maple syrup too,\" he said.\n\n\"Consumers need to understand there's a tremendous amount of work going to getting a beautiful truffle on a table, or in their butter.\"\n\nGrowing truffles a gamble\n\nTruffles will last around a week after they are picked. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nDavid McConnell admits truffle growing can feel like a bit of a gamble each year.\n\n\"The interesting thing about truffles is the dog indicates where they are and until we uncover it we don't know if it's ripe or not,\" Mr McConnell said.\n\n\"You buy the trees inoculated with truffle spores and then you cross your fingers and hope that in four to six years that you'll be successful.\n\n\" There's no way of knowing if you will or won't. We've been lucky we have had success. \"\n\nBecause truffles are grown underground, growers must train dogs to sniff out the ripe ones before they can dig them up.\n\nWinnie and Audrey the basenjis. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nMr McConnell said the fungi did not ripen with time once they were picked so the dogs needed to get the smell correct straight away.\n\n\" It's sad if it isn't ready because once it's lost its connection to the roots in the ground it doesn't ripen. \"\n\nThe Strathbogie ranges are ideal for growing truffles with high rain, hot summers and very cold winters.\n\nHowever, seasonal conditions this year have been very dry and the truffles have been a bit smaller than usual.\n\n\"There is nothing like rain from the sky. It's been a challenge to keep the soil moist this year,\" Mr McConnell said.\n\n\"But the demand is growing. We've had our truffles sent all over the world.\"",

Yes, there will be bumps on the road ahead - two Tests in South Africa are next - but the Wallabies won four halves out of the six in this series.",

        "text": "French rider Pauline Ferrand-Prevot took a commanding lead at the Tour de France Femmes after launching a solo victory on the final climb of Sunday AEST's penultimate stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australian rider Sarah Gigante surged into second place, two minutes and 37 seconds behind, on a day of big changes in the leading positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 champion, Demi Vollering of the Netherlands, is 3:18 adrift heading into Monday's last stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight leader Kimberley Le Court Pienaar \u2014 Gigante's AG Insurance-Soudal teammmate \u2014 crashed on the descent from the Col du Frene with 63 kilometres remaining, briefly trailing the peloton by about a minute.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe rejoined, but the effort and the relentless climbing cost her in the general classification as she dropped to 11th place.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year's event had the smallest winning margin in the history of the women's and men's races, but Ferrand-Prevot \u2014 who won the mountain bike gold medal at last year's Paris Olympics \u2014 appears to be winning far more comfortably, despite Gigante's efforts.\n\n\n\nThe Frenchwoman trailed Le Court by 26 seconds heading into stage eight from Chambery to Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-Longchamp, which took the riders on a 112-kilometre trek into the mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt featured an early climb of 13 kilometres up Col de Plainpalais before finishing with an ascent of 18.6 kilometres to Col de Madeleine, one of the most famed climbs in cycling.\n\n\n\n\n\nGigante went on the offensive with 12 kilometres to go, and only Ferrand-Prevot of the GC favourites was able to stay with her on the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Olympic champion then attacked at the start of the final nine kilometres and Gigante was unable to keep up with her.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchwoman hit the front seven kilometres from the summit and powered to a superb victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nGigante crossed the line 1:45 behind her, while Niamh Fisher-Black rolled in 2:15 behind in third spot. Vollering was fourth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 24-year-old Melburnian had joked on Saturday night, at the end of the seventh stage, that some of the big names had \"missed a couple of opportunities\" to shake her off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could have got rid of me yesterday, maybe Kim today. We'll see what happens, but from our point of view, hopefully they live to regret it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday's ninth and final stage from Praz-sur-Arly to Chatel is another mountainous route, with three big climbs, and is even longer at 124 kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

So when you go swimming in the tourist attraction places, there will be a little QR code that you can scan. And when you scan it it shows you the history of Mangarrayi country and all about Mataranka photos and fishing places and shops and yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe talks about her app design - from planning to detailing it out on the computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as Monash Health, Victoria\u2019s largest health service and Indigenous-owned and managed non-for-profit organisation, Deadly Coders are helping introduce First Nations students to career pathways in Science, Technology, Engineering or Maths.\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Carter is the Chief Aboriginal Health Adviser at Monash Health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is really to expose Aboriginal and Torres Strait kids in school to STEM science, technology, engineering, math career pathways, and as a large health service that does have many STEM careers across engineering and other areas, we thought this was a really good fit for expanding on our Aboriginal workforce, that we have real targets in place to really try and recruit and engage with more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash Health also has a well-established program for the recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses, midwives, and allied health workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Carter told SBS News how they have created an opportunity to help build the future workforce and broaden the roles filled by Indigenous Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have an Aboriginal employment plan at Monash Health that looks at the recruitment and retention of Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander staff and career development as well. And so we do a pretty good job at the traditional career areas of medicine, doctors, nurses, and allied health. And we thought how do we expand upon that to engage in some of those careers in the STEM place across the spectrum of careers and health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were approached by Deadly Coders to run a small mini hackathon event to engage local school kids in the area, as they invest resources into digital health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Digital Health is really the information and communication structure systems that sit behind our health services that really support us to deliver or tackle health problems and then support us to deliver health solutions in, I guess, delivery of healthcare to improve health outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly Coders ran the App Prototyping Program at Melbourne's Moorabbin Hospital, with a focus on digital health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare defines digital health as systems, tools and services based on information and communications technology that can be used to treat patients and collect and share a patient\u2019s health information.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Brodie is the Co-Founder and General Manager Deadly Coders, that more broadly delivers STEM education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That might be a face-to-face STEM program at a school for children in Year Two. And in that case, the programs would be designed to be gamified, hands on story based, pedagogically aligned to how indigenous kids learn best and they're really designed to get kids interested in something and bring down barriers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says they move from there into more formal programs with high school students where they may be teaching text-based coding languages, problem solving with technology, building robots, or learning how to build a website.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indigenous-run not-for-profit's aim is to build interest, excitement and curiosity in STEM through hands-on activities and gamified learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also have an online learning platform, so that online learning platform has valuable content on there. Things like digital literacy, financial literacy, coding tutorials. That particular platform is I think the only platform. It's kind designed by indigenous educators and tech experts and specifically for indigenous students.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe adds that if students can learn to link fundamental skills in A-I [[artificial intelligence]] with something in the real world, that's what they want to achieve by building that engagement amongst students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also run the Deadly Coders Academy - a job skilling program designed to create alternative pathways into the tech sector through upskilling rather than formal qualifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The students essentially will have some time learning about a design thinking framework. So essentially at big businesses, how to tech groups within those big businesses work together to solve problems. Once the students have a bit of a grounding in that design thinking framework, they will then get access to and a bit of a 101 crash course in how to use an app prototyping software.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says at the end of the three days, the students in their group will get an opportunity to pitch what they've built back to Monash Health and he hopes a panel of people there will be able to decide which app solves the problem the best.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkeima is a 14-year-old from the Katherine community.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the three-days, she created a Mindset app for people struggling in school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the second day we wrote it down and we started planning it. And at the end of the day we brought out our computers and started making our account to put it in, and the third day we just finishing up our apps with classical coding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it was inspiring to hear from the speakers from Monash Health at the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was kind of inspiring cause it made me thought probably in my course I would have helped out with hospitals or something like that. It was really good of hearing of how they were going with their life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Carter says the students enjoy tackling digital solutions in a health setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The kids have just really just enjoyed engaging with a bit of a fun program to tackle digital solutions to digital problems in a health setting. So this has more been about engaging the students at a high school level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly Coders have been around since mid 2023. Andrew Brodie says they are growing quickly and have space for up to 30 students in their program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We always have some students that just take to technology like a duck to water, and it's really nice watching young people who just, something clicks for them and they get it and they get really interested in it, especially when there are kids who may not have seen technology as a pathway that was available to them. So we do get a lot of kids who didn't realise they were interested in technology, it clicks for them and they just love the program and get really interested after that.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "With new Australian-first rules suggested, working from home might soon be a legal right for Victorians.\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan announced on Thursday that she would introduce legislation in 2026 legally enshrining the right to work from home for two days a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllan said she expected the plan to face some criticism but said many Victorians stood to benefit from the changes, which will cover all employees who can \"reasonably\" do their job from home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bosses who think being seen at a desk is more important than a parent getting home for dinner with their kids, if they want to look their workers in the eye and tell them their time with their families doesn't count, they know where my government stands,\" Allan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We won't stand by while workers \u2014 especially women, single mums, carers \u2014 get punished for needing balance in their lives.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The male breadwinner is gone. Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nDetails are yet to be worked through but Allan signalled the changes could come into effect under Victoria's Equal Opportunity Act, as private workplaces are regulated by federal laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues such as the definition of remote work, who can do it, how it would affect part-time workers and the types of businesses to which the law would apply, will be figured out through a consultation process.\n\n\n\n'Complete overreach'\n\nPeak business bodies have criticised the plan, with Committee for Melbourne CEO Scott Veenker calling it a \"complete overreach\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's another regulatory burden or requirement that just makes the cost of doing business too hard,\" he said, adding that his group \"hadn't been consulted with prior to the announcement\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality is that we want to actually have an environment where businesses can thrive and flourish, and they don't need more regulation and more legislation to prevent them [from] doing that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVeenker said the state government's new plan will make \"members both small and large\" of the business advocacy group ask if they should \"continue trading in Victoria\".\n\n\n\n\"We know that businesses will move their staff and their resources accordingly, and we don't want Victoria to be seen as a place that's too hard to do business,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They should be arrangements that are really done in conjunction with staff and the employers, rather than the state government trying to put their nose into this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want the state government to be looking at how we should be focusing on economic growth and enabling businesses to prosper.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Committee for Melbourne, which merged with the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce in 2024, describes itself as being founded \"to champion key initiatives to stimulate the economy and civic development, which put Melbourne on a pathway to become one of the world\u2019s most liveable cities\".\n\n\n\n'A really good initiative'\n\nHowever, several people SBS News talked to on the streets of Melbourne said they supported the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne young woman said it was \"a really good initiative\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think working from home allows people to have a bit more of better work-lifestyle balance, therefore making them happy \u2014 happy to be at work when it is time to be at work, [and] happy to be at home,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAnother woman SBS News spoke to said the ability to work from home \"just makes life so much easier\". Source: SBS News A middle-aged man said he currently had an arrangement to work one day a fortnight at home and would \"certainly be keen for that to be made a legal thing to do more\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA young man who works from home said: \"going to [the] office necessarily doesn't mean full productivity, so that's something people have to consider,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral experts recently told SBS News that working from home breaks down barriers to gender equality in the workplace and is necessary for modern families, especially those who face significant commutes to work.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New research shows just how much money people working from home save SBS News 03:56 English\n\nMore than one in three Australian employees typically work from home, but that figure rises to 60 per cent among managers and those in professional services, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABS also says 43 per cent of those who work from home do overtime, compared to one quarter of those who do not.\n\n\n\nState Opposition signals possible support\n\nAllan \u2014 whose announcement coincided with the Victorian Labor Party meeting for its annual conference \u2014 has promised to introduce the law in 2026, prior to the state election.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolls indicate Labor is on track to win a fourth term but the November 2026 poll will be the first as premier for Allan, who lags Opposition leader Brad Battin as preferred state leader.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Battin indicated he might support the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We support measures that help Victorians enjoy a better work-life balance, and will review any legislation closely, to ensure it supports flexibility, productivity and personal choice,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe federal Opposition's proposal to eliminate remote work for public servants was partly blamed for its poor performance in the May federal election, even though it abandoned the policy before voting day.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the campaign, former Opposition leader Peter Dutton apologised after admitting that the proposal to end work-from-home arrangements for public servants was a \"mistake\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan was immediately framed by Labor and Greens parliamentarians as being a regressive move for women's working rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also criticised as being inspired by the policies of United States President Donald Trump. One of Trump's first policies after being elected for a second term was to order all government workers to return to the office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

Mauritian rider Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) lost ground on the Granier but finished sixth to retain the yellow jersey.\n\n\n\nLe Court is ahead of Frenchwoman Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease a Bike) by 26 seconds and Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma Phinney (Canyon-SRAM) by 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nMountains classification leader Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) endured a difficult day and was distanced from the peloton before Squiban's climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby Roseman-Gannon was the only other Australian rider to finish inside the top 100 and she is 68th overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday's mountain stage will be from Chambery to Saint-Francois-Longchamp.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Picture: David Geraghty / NewsWire\n\nA two-speed booze tax kicks in Monday, as beer taxes are frozen while spirits are slugged by the twice-a-year price hike.\n\nAnthony Albanese made the two-year beer tax freeze an election promise and has paused any tax increases on kegged beer.\n\nBut the freeze creates an unequal playing field between draught and liquor, as cocktail and spirit drinkers will see venues pass on the latest tax hike at the till.\n\n\u201cWith cost-of-living pressures biting hard, even the smallest increase in price is noticed by customers and businesses alike,\u201d Night Time Industries Association boss Mick Gibb told NewsWire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for special treatment, just equal treatment. Freezing the beer excise is a great thing, but we can\u2019t leave behind the small bars, live music venues and performance spaces that aren\u2019t running beer taps.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s lots of factors involved in pricing a cocktail or a drink, if there\u2019s a cost input that the government has control over, they should be leveraging it to give people a bit of breathing room.\u201d\n\nTax increases on draught beer have been paused for two years. Picture: Glenn Campbell / NewsWire\n\nSubstantive, quarterly inflation data released this week shows inflation has flattened out to 2.1 per cent over the past year.\n\nDespite this reprieve for household budgets, the majority of average workers cannot afford a quick drink after work, the Night Time Industries Association finds.\n\nThe association\u2019s latest quarterly report found people on salaries between $80,000 to $150,000 were staying in, while people being paid more than $150,000 were going out more and more.\n\n\u201cCost-of-living pressures are far from over, with many venues reporting consumers are foregoing the after-work drink for less frequent, but more extravagant experiences for special occasions at a premium restaurant or an international artists\u2019 gig,\u201d Mr Gibb said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Australian Distillers Association says distillers and venues cannot cop the price hike.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly disappointing. It\u2019s not just another tax hike, it\u2019s a significant one that\n\ndistillers and hospitality venues simply can\u2019t absorb,\u201d distillers boss Cameron Mackenzie told NewsWire.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s customers who\u2019ll be left paying more for their favourite spirits\u201d\n\nHalf of Australian distilleries were in the regions, he said, and drove manufacturing, jobs and tourism.\n\n\u201cThis tax hike hits everyone: producers, venues and consumers who\u2019ll see higher prices for their favourite gin and tonic.\u201d\n\nOut campaigning, the Prime Minister poured plenty of beers, but the tax freeze was announced weeks before the election date was officially called.\n\nThe Labor government has enacted the beer tax freeze, promised by Anthony Albanese before the campaign period earlier this year. Picture: Mark Stewart / NewsWire\n\nAt that time, Treasurer Jim Chalmers called the tax break modest. News.com.au reported last week the lost tax revenue would equal $95m over four years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s office declined to say how much the tax break would cost the budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on easing the cost of living for Australians, and we know that every little bit helps. This will help take a bit of pressure off beer drinkers, brewers and bars,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a tax cut for every taxpayer, help with energy bills, or the new relief that\u2019s rolling out this month like higher wages for award workers, we\u2019re doing everything we responsibly can to help with the cost of living.\u201d\n\nThe tax freeze only applies to beers on tap at licensed hospitality venues. Stubbies and cans at the bar or bottle store are excluded. Distilled spirits are totally excluded from the freeze no matter where they are purchased or how they are consumed. From Monday, taxes on spirits with more than 10 per cent alcohol will increase 1.6 per cent.\n\nAlcohol taxes rise in February and August every year. For beer, the rates vary depending on alcohol content, the size and type of container it\u2019s packaged in, and whether it was made at a commercial brewery or a \u201cbrew-on-premise\u201d venue.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKegs of the most common beers at pubs are usually 50 litre. Tax on each 50-litre keg of full strength beer will stay at $43.39 for the next two years.\n\nWillie the Boatman brewery has canonised Anthony Albanese with a pale ale. Picture: Jason Edwards / NewsWire\n\nWine falls under a separate tax regimen than beer and spirits. Wine is taxed at 29 per cent of the wholesale value.\n\nThe beer and spirits excise has ticked up and along without reform for more than 40 years.\n\nThe Australian Hotels Association says the decades-old format needs to change.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the need for the government to raise revenue from liquor excise but the way excise was going up every six months was keeping people at home, drinking alone rather than getting out and socialising in safe, local venues,\u201d AHA president David Canny told NewsWire.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure a beer poured at the bar doesn\u2019t become a luxury item and this is a great step towards that.\u201d\n\nHospitality and brewing groups say the tax freeze will support jobs, promote socialisation and provide general cost-of-living relief. Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\nThis two-year freeze helped support 300,000 hospitality staff, Mr Canny said.\n\n\u201cIt is great to see the Albanese government has listened and acted on this unpopular hidden tax,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better place to have a beer than down at the local \u2013 they are a place for community and connection \u2013 and anything that makes it a little bit more affordable is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win for common sense in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Brewers Association of Australia similarly enjoyed news of the freeze but had its eye on long-term change.\n\n\u201cWe certainly thank the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer for backing this in,\u201d Brewers Association chief executive Amanda Watson told NewsWire.\n\n\u201cBrewers will continue to work with the government to ensure future excise reform is looked at seriously to support a sustainable Australian brewing sector.\u201d",

Source: Reddit/isjimmyhere\n\nYou might drive past and not notice, but if you're paying attention, it would be hard to miss a bizarre \u2013 and illegal \u2013 roadside practice that is again being called out in one of Australia's biggest cities.\n\nAlong a major freeway in Melbourne, drivers continue to discard disposable e-cigarette cartridges or vapes, causing them to keep building up on a dividing wall along the West Gate Freeway as motorists head into the city.\n\nOne driver took a photo of the stretch of road, sharing it online on Saturday, showing the plastic vapes littered all over the place, prompting some to call for cameras to be installed to catch the drivers responsible for the trend.\n\n\"This is gross, clean this up. Fine the people doing this,\" one commenter said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This is deeply infuriating. It\u2019s absurd the fact that this amount of people in this country think littering is completely acceptable,\" another wrote.\n\nRelated: Concerning roadside find reveals dangerous trend landing users in hospital\n\nWhile Melbourne, like cities around the country, has increased the number of cameras monitoring motorists for driving infringements like mobile phone use, some residents believe littering cameras should be installed at the trouble spot.\n\n\"Seems like a camera would pay itself back with fines in a week,\" one person commented.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Authority of Victoria (EPA), the fine for littering from a vehicle is $407 and $2,035 for a company. However that jumps if the item is considered dangerous, like a lit cigarette, doubling to $814 and $4,070 respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt's been an ongoing issue that authorities have had to deal with over the last couple of years. When previously contacted by Yahoo about the problem on the West Gate Freeway, it was understood The Department of Transport, which oversees the freeway, did not have a specific plan for the vape littering trend and was treating it like regular rubbish build up.\n\nAn Australian Border Force officers inspects cartons of seized vapes at the a Container Examination Facility in Sydney. Source: AAP\n\nLast year, a parliamentary inquiry in Victoria heard how the plastic e-cigarette devices were creating an increasing environmental problem in the state, as well as posing a serious risk of starting fires when littered.\n\n\"Vapes contain lithium-ion batteries, which are combustible and are an ignition source when improperly handled, meaning that they can cause fires when they are not sorted, separated, handled, or stored appropriately,\" the then CEO of Victoria's EPA, Lee Miezis, told the inquiry.\n\nWar against vapes is driving down the number of users\n\nShifting social norms and concerted government campaigns are slowing the number of young people being hooked on vapes, but Australia isn't out of the woods yet, expert say.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA survey of almost 15,000 14 to 17-year olds found the number of teens vaping fell from 18 to 15 per cent since February 2023.\n\nA report released last month by the Cancer Council's Generation Vape Project found rates of e-cigarettes among 30 to-59-year-olds have halved, while fewer than one-in-five 18 to 24-year-olds used vapes.\n\nDespite being banned, vape shops and tobacconists are leading a rise in black market sales of vapes, Cancer Council chair Alecia Brooks said.\n\nThe report found the number of vapes being bought by young people at stores surged to almost 35 per cent of all sales. That is despite laws only allowing vapes to be sold in participating pharmacies where they are sold for the purpose of helping people quit smoking or manage nicotine dependence.\n\nThe Australian Border Force and the Therapeutic Goods Administration have also seized almost $500 billion worth of illicit vapes since January 2024.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in Australia and is estimated to kill more than 24,000 Australians each year.\n\nwith AAP\n\nDo you have a story tip?
