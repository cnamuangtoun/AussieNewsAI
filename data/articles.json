        "text": "Elon Musk has lost his title of \"world's richest person\" to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\n\nEllison's wealth jumped by $US101 billion ($152 billion) to $US393 billion ($594 billion) after Oracle's stunningly strong earnings report this week, surpassing Musk's net worth of $US385 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nOracle (ORCL) reported surging demand for its data centre capacity from AI customers, launching the stock into the stratosphere. Shares gained 36 per cent on Wednesday, which was the stock's biggest single-day gain since 1992.\n\nElon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (AP)\n\nChief executive Safra Catz announced on Tuesday after the stock market closed that Oracle signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with customers during the quarter, and she expects to sign several more in the coming months.\n\nThat electric forecast was powered by Oracle's emergence as a key provider of infrastructure that powers AI companies' enormous demands for computing power \u2013 Oracle's bread and butter as a cloud services and database software provider.\n\n\"We'll be talking about this one for a long time,\" said Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research, about Oracle's earnings report in a note to investors on Wednesday.\n\nReitzes called Oracle's $US455 billion backlog in demand for its AI services \"staggering.\"\n\nEllison is Oracle's largest individual shareholder and captured the title of world's richest person because of the stock's extraordinary gains on Wednesday. The stock's jump is exceedingly rare for a company that has a massive market value.\n\nOracle co-founder Larry Ellison is the world's richest person. (Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris) (Bloomberg)\n\nOracle's market value gained roughly $US244 billion on Wednesday, lifting it to roughly $US922 billion. Oracle on Wednesday jumped from being the 13th-most valuable company in the US S&P 500 to the 10th most-valuable.\n\nBloomberg notes Ellison's leap in wealth is the \"biggest one-day increase ever recorded\" recorded by the index.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla shares (TSLA) are down roughly 14 per cent this year.\n\nMusk first captured the title of the world's richest person in 2021 and has largely held on to it for the past few years, thanks in part to his various investments in Tesla and SpaceX.\n\nOver the years, Musk has briefly lost it twice, first in 2021 to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and in 2024 to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.",

        "text": "A new survey has revealed a dramatic shift in how Australians are managing their money, with almost half of all \"mum and dad\" investors now asking artificial intelligence platforms for investment tips.\n\nFindings from an Australian Retail Investor Confidence survey, conducted by Chartered Accountants ANZ, highlight a growing reliance on tools like ChatGPT and Co-Pilot to guide investment decisions.\n\nThe survey, which for the first time asked 1000 Australian investors about their use of AI, found that 48 per cent are now using these platforms.\n\nAussie investors are increasingly turning to AI for financial advice, a new survey has found. (iStock)\n\n\"We have seen adoption of AI grow rapidly for both personal and professional use, but it is interesting to see investors are using it to guide where their money goes,\" Chartered Accountants ANZ CEO Ainslie van Onselen said.\n\nThe trend is particularly strong among younger investors, with 78 per cent of those aged 18-29 using AI for their financial decisions.\n\nThe survey also found a gender gap, with 15 per cent of male investors using AI extensively, compared to just 9 per cent of women.\n\nWhile the adoption of AI is on the rise, trust remains a significant hurdle.\n\nAround 43 per cent of those surveyed said they don't use AI because they lack confidence in the information it provides, and 46 per cent prefer to stick with more traditional sources.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of reliable, human-backed financial information.\n\n\"Investors regard auditors as the foremost protectors of their interests, demonstrating a high level of trust in qualified professionals who deliver audit and assurance services,\" Van Onselen said.\n\n\"After all, AI information is only as good as its source.\"\n\nThis is supported by the survey data, which showed a four-point jump in strong confidence in audited financial statements since last year, now at 54 per cent.\n\nDespite global uncertainty, investor confidence in the Australian market is on the rise.\n\nCA ANZ chief economist, Professor Richard Holden, attributes this to a strong domestic economy.\n\n\"Confidence in Australian capital markets and listed companies has risen significantly at a time of global uncertainty, along with confidence in auditors and financial statements,\" Holden said.\n\nThe increasing use of AI highlighted the need for high-quality data to train these models, Holden added.\n\nThe survey also revealed a six-point increase in the percentage of investors with high confidence in Australian companies, and 42 per cent cited the recent federal election as a factor that boosted their confidence to invest.\n\nHowever, global unrest is making investors more cautious about overseas investments, with confidence in these markets dropping from 78 per cent to 73 per cent.\n\nThe rise of AI in finance is not limited to retail investors.\n\nA separate global report from Chartered Accountants Worldwide and Ipsos UK found that 79 per cent of chartered accountants believe their role as \"data guardians\" will become increasingly important as AI is integrated more into business.",

The group said it had collected more than 3000 industry signatures since the pledge was made public.\n\n\u201cAs filmmakers, actors, film industry workers, and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions,\u201d the open letter says. \u201cIn this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.\u201d\n\nMark Ruffalo and Emma Stone, co-stars of acclaimed film Poor Things, both signed on. (Getty)\n\nFilm Workers for Palestine \u2014 a group of film professionals based in various countries formed in early 2024 \u2014 said their pledge was inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, who refused to screen their films in apartheid South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions \u2014 including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies \u2014 that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people,\u201d the letter says.\n\nThe group has not called for a boycott on all Israeli film institutions. It claims on its website that Israel\u2019s public and private broadcasters \u201chave decades-old and ongoing involvement in whitewashing, denying and justifying Israel\u2019s war crimes\u201d and also says Israel\u2019s major film festivals \u2014 including the Jerusalem Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival and others \u2014 \u201ccontinue to partner with the Israeli government while it carries out what leading experts have defined as genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d\n\nBut it says that it does not consider all film institutions in Israel complicit, and advises people to ask questions and \u201cseek guidelines set by Palestinian civil society.\u201d\n\nOlivia Colman poses for photographers upon arrival at the Burberry Winter 2024 fashion show. (Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)\n\nThe Jerusalem Film Festival did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe pledge also specifies that it is targeting institutions and not individuals: \u201cThe call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel\u2019s human rights abuses against the Palestinian people. This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity.\u201d\n\nA representative of the Israeli film and television industry called the boycott \u201cmisguided.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the industry that (has been) struggling for years, making efforts for decades to promote discussion,\u201d working with Palestinians and Israelis to tell the story of the conflict from all sides, said Tzvika Gottlieb, CEO of the Israeli Film & TV Producers Association, in an interview.\n\nREAD MORE: Apple unveils thinnest iPhone ever as new changes revealed\n\nAyo Edebiri (Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)\n\nGottlieb said his industry \u201chas consistently maintained a critical stance toward government policies, and is very vocal in criticism of this administration\u2019s current actions. We urgently call for an immediate end to the violence, an end to the suffering, and the release of all hostages right now.\u201d\n\nHis group added in official remarks that \u201cthis call for a boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us \u2014 the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue \u2014 these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us.\u201d\n\nIn response, Film Workers for Palestine issued a statement to The Associated Press, saying their initiative is \u201crooted in historic struggles,\" in particular \"the successful international movement to end the apartheid regime of South Africa.\u201d\n\nTilda Swinton at the opening ceremony during the 82nd Venice International Film Festival. (WireImage)\n\n\u201cShould Israeli film institutions wish to continue working with pledge signatories, their choice is clear: end complicity in Israel\u2019s genocide and apartheid, and endorse the full rights of the Palestinian people under international law, in line with Palestinian civil society guidelines,\" the statement said. \"To date, almost none has.\u201d\n\nThe pledge comes after a pro-Palestinian demonstration at the recent Venice International Film Festival drew an estimated 10,000 participants.

        "text": "Australian National University (ANU) vice-chancellor Genevieve Bell has resigned from her position but says she will remain at the university in an academic capacity after some time off.\n\nProfessor Bell had been under increasing scrutiny due to forced redundancies and her handling of related concerns from staff and students.\n\nIn a letter tendering her resignation as vice-chancellor, she said working in the role had been \"an extraordinary privilege and also a heavy responsibility\".\n\n\"This was not an easy decision,\" Professor Bell said.\n\n\"As many of you know, the ANU has been a special place for me, ever since I was a child.\n\n\"Like the rest of our community, I believe firmly in our delivering on our national mission \u2014 to create and transmit knowledge through research and teaching of the highest quality.\n\n\"And know that doing this requires a solid financial, cultural and operational foundation.\"\n\nProfessor Bell said achieving that solid foundation had been \"difficult\" and acknowledged that recently the university had been experiencing \"a very hard time\".\n\nShe said she would be taking some time off, including a period of study leave, before returning to the School of Cybernetics as a distinguished professor.\n\n\"I know there is still more work to do so,\" she said.\n\n\" I very much want to see the ANU thrive into the future and for it to continue to be a remarkable place and I don't want to stand in the way of that. \"\n\nProfessor Bell was appointed as the institution's 13th vice-chancellor in January 2024, taking over from Professor Brian Schmidt.\n\nThe cultural anthropologist inherited what she described as an \"enormous number of challenges\" at the ANU.\n\nIn October of last year, the university announced plans to save $250 million in operating costs by 2026 \u2014 including $100 million through salaries.\n\nIn a letter to ANU staff, Chancellor Julie Bishop thanked Professor Bell for her service as vice-chancellor and president.\n\nPressure to save millions\n\nA series of \"change proposals\" followed \u2014 involving cuts and restructures across the institution.\n\nThe 'Renew ANU' plan and Professor Bell's leadership have both been the subject of fierce and mounting backlash from staff, students and the National Tertiary Education Union.\n\nThe ANU has plans to overhaul the 60-year-old ANU School of Music, including dropping one-on-one instrument lessons. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nA controversial move to axe the renowned School of Music garnered particular outrage, sparking campus protests and condemnation from leaders in the arts industry.\n\nAustralian Chamber Orchestra director Richard Tognetti warned the plan would be tantamount to \"cultural vandalism\".\n\nProfessor Bell also faced criticism for being paid $70,000 for 24 hours' work by her previous employer, Silicon Valley technology company Intel, while also taking home her more than $1 million vice-chancellor's salary.\n\nUnion members supported a vote of no confidence against her and Ms Bishop and have repeatedly called for their resignation.\n\nProfessor Bell long resisted that pressure and accused her critics of using her gender as a tactic to undermine her.\n\n\"Sexism is alive and well and living in Australia,\" she told ABC's Stateline in March.\n\nAustralian National University chancellor Julie Bishop was accused of bullying and harassment. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nAccusations and investigations add to turmoil\n\nUproar over the ANU's leadership reached fever pitch last month, when academic and former ANU Council member Liz Allen accused Chancellor Julie Bishop of bullying, harassment and hostile behaviour during a Senate inquiry into university governance.\n\nLoading...\n\nMs Bishop, who was appointed as chancellor in 2020 after a career in federal politics, denied any wrongdoing and the university established a group to oversee an investigation into the allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, the ANU remains under investigation by the higher education regulator, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), over concerns about the university's operations.\n\nA fortnight ago, Professor Bell announced future savings in the university's ongoing restructure would not involve forced job cuts.\n\nThat did not include areas of the university where a savings plan had already been announced.\n\nThe move failed to remedy the loss of confidence in Professor Bell's leadership.\n\n'Will take time to heal'\n\nLachlan Clohesy of the National Tertiary Education Union said they welcomed news of the resignation.\n\n\"The announcement of the vice-chancellor's departure must also be accompanied by an announcement that all forced redundancies will now cease,\" he said.\n\n\"We welcome this development. But we also need to recognise the incredible toll the last two years have taken on the ANU community, and that will take time to heal.\n\n\"Changing the vice-chancellor will not fix the ANU's issues unless governance concerns are also addressed.\"\n\nThe student group No Cuts at ANU called the resignation the \"outcome of months of campaigning by students, staff and the ANU community against Renew ANU and university management\".\n\n\"This has demonstrated that the real power lies with students and staff, not the profiteering bosses at the head of this university,\" spokeswoman Lucy Chapman-Kelly said.\n\n\"Students facing hundreds of staff cuts, multiple degrees abolished, the merger or eradication of entire colleges, have called for Bell to be sacked since January this year.\"",

        "text": "The Northern Territory's mud crab industry will not supply crabs to the market this Christmas after a decision to close its fisheries for three months.\n\nIt came after a harvest strategy assessment found the catch rate of mud crabs in the Arafura West region had fallen below a trigger point.\n\nFrom November 1 to January 31, there will be no commercial crabbing in Arafura West, which covers a large stretch of the territory coastline.\n\nThere will also be a voluntary closure in the Gulf of Carpentaria from December 1 to February 28.\n\nThere are two mud crab fisheries in the Northern Territory. (Supplied: AFANT)\n\nNT Seafood Council chief executive Daniel Capps said the mud crab industry had faced an initial mandatory closure of six weeks, but volunteered for it to go longer.\n\n\"The thinking here is, let's act before there is a sustainability issue,\" he said.\n\n\"The industry has shown real leadership here and are on the front foot, they're being proactive in making sure there isn't an issue in the future.\"\n\nMr Capps said it was not the first time a trigger point had been reached and the current situation was not a cause for alarm.\n\n\" Let's be proactive, because there's nothing more Territorian than mud crabs and we want to make sure they're there for the future. \"\n\nMud crabs are caught in the Gulf of Carpentaria. (ABC Rural: Daniel Fitzgerald)\n\nNo crabs for Christmas\n\nThe Aboriginal Sea Company (ASC) owns several mud crab fishing licences.\n\nActing chief executive Jared Copley said the company supported the closure.\n\n\"We think it's good practice to give the crab [population] a refresh,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to see mud crabs thrive for years to come, so we fully support the closure and it's also why we've opted for the additional six weeks.\"\n\nMr Copley said the wet season period was normally a quieter time for the industry, but customers would notice a lack of NT mud crabs for sale over the Christmas period.\n\n\"There is going to be a bit of pain for local customers wanting to get a mud crab over the Christmas period, so they'll have to seek alternative sources [or] get something else for the table,\" he said.\n\nChanges for recreational fishers\n\nAmateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory (AFANT) chief executive David Ciaravolo said the commercial industry was responsible for 70 per cent of the total catch in the Arafura West zone, and recreational fishers were taking the other 30 per cent.\n\nHe said the mud crab harvest strategy required NT Fisheries to \"implement appropriate management options\" for recreational fishing, and AFANT was now surveying its members about possible options.\n\n\"So what we're trying to do is reduce the harvest of crabs during the key spawning season,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an important time of year for recreational crabbing and people wanting to get some crabs for Christmas.\n\n\" But there are things we can do to contribute to the sustainability and recovery of stocks. \"\n\nDavid Ciaravolo is confident mud crab stocks can bounce back. (ABC News: Jane Bardon)\n\nMr Ciaravolo said the survey included options such as reducing the possession limit or introducing a season closure for recreational crabbing.\n\n\"We know that most recreational fishers will understand the need to support sustainable resource management and are willing to play their part in supporting the recovery of mud crab stocks,\" he said.\n\n\"We recognise the strong commitment to sustainability, evidenced by the commercial sector's initiative to double the commercial closure [time].\"\n\nLoading...\n\nMr Ciaravolo expected NT Fisheries would make a decision on recreational crabbing rules by October.\n\nHe said crab numbers plummeted in the gulf in 2015 but through improved weather conditions and sustainable fishing, the numbers bounced back.\n\nHe said the current possession limit for mud crabs in the NT was \"a very generous\" 10 crabs per person, per day.",

(Supplied: Lawrence Scheele)\n\nGethin Morgan from Magnetic Island Nature Care believes in his 30 years on the island, the underwater environment has degraded.\n\n\"When the wind blows and you've got a few days of strong wind the whole bay just gets muddy right into these little bays,\" he said.\n\nHe blames the Port of Townsville and its maintenance dredging program, which allows silt and mud to be dumped in the bay.\n\n\"We're pushing for it to be dumped in deeper water but before that could happen there needs to be proper modelling done now,\" he said.\n\nGethin Morgan says tourists used to be able to see pristine corals at Geoffrey Bay's intertidal zone. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nMr Morgan believes the fine silt, dredged from the shipping channel, is being washed onto the island's inshore reefs.\n\n\"It's a tremendous refuge, it's a biodiversity hotspot. Cleveland Bay is really important,\" he said.\n\nThe port will next year begin planning for how to deal with the dredged material over the next decade.\n\nA satellite image taken during this year's dredge period. (Supplied: Lawrence Scheele)\n\nDredging maintains port operations\n\nDredging is required to keep shipping channels clear up and down the coastline, with one hopper dredge, owned by the Port of Brisbane, servicing nine Queensland ports year-round.\n\nThat includes the Port of Townsville, where the channel was recently widened as part of a $251 million expansion completed in late 2024, allowing vessels of up to 300 metres to berth.\n\nThis hopper dredge, owned by the Port of Brisbane, services nine Queensland ports. (Supplied: Port of Townsville)\n\nFor a month each year, the Port of Townsville dredges 400,000 to 450,000 metres cubed of sediment from the city's shipping passage.\n\nIt is permitted to dispose the mud at an underwater depth of 10 to 16 metres, in an area that was excised from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as a Dredge Material Placement Area.\n\nThe Port of Townsville's expansion has allowed larger cruise ships to dock. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nReef always in cycle of stress and recovery\n\nSilt can cause damage to coral by blocking light, which inhibits the ability of the algae living in the coral to photosynthesise and feed the coral.\n\nBut Andy Lewis, a marine biologist and the executive director of not-for-profit the Coral Sea Foundation, said the reefs around the island were in good condition.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the dredging is increasing sediment load in the water, but the reefs around here are adapted to living in a high sediment environment,\" he said.\n\nAndy Lewis has lived at Magnetic Island and monitored its reefs for more than two decades. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nDr Lewis, who has dived Magnetic Island's reefs for more than 25 years and kept records of recovery, did not believe there was evidence of long-term decline in coral cover as a result of dredge activity.\n\n\"Some of the highest coral cover reefs we have around the island are in areas of exceptionally high sediment flow,\" he said.\n\nHe said the shallow average depth of water and sediment run-off from the mainland nearby made the environment naturally turbid, and that cyclones had also taken a toll.\n\n\"[Cyclone Tessi]took out a lot of those corals in the intertidal [zone]but the subtidal corals below the high tide mark are still in really good condition,\" he said.\n\nThis \"blue bum\" porite coral in Geoffrey Bay shows quick recovery from natural stressors over a three-year period. (Supplied: Coral Sea Foundation)\n\nHowever, he still believed the best-case scenario for the environment would be putting all dredge spoil on land, particularly in the face of increasing stress on the reef.\n\n\"I think everything that we can do now to limit the amount of pressure on our reef system is valuable,\" he said.\n\nOceanographer Eric Wolanski recently published a paper on the health of the Cleveland Bay ecosystem, suggesting dredging had exacerbated the bay's natural murkiness by adding more sediment.\n\n\"The water has become very turbid and it has decreased from 8m visibility in the 1960s to 1m nowadays,\" Dr Wolanski said.\n\nEric Wolanski says modelling shows dumped dredged mud is being moved by currents around the island. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nThe Port of Townsville has monitoring buoys in place around the bay that monitor water quality.\n\nIt is one of several in Queensland, like Gladstone and Cairns, permitted to dump maintenance dredge spoil in designated marine areas.\n\nDr Wolanski is critical of the monitoring.\n\nHe believes silt was affecting reefs on the western side of the island where there are no permanent water monitoring buoys in place.\n\n\"It's completely unsustainable. It's not an example we should use to plan for the future,\" he said.\n\nLocal divers say this coral at Magnetic Island is coated with sediment. (Supplied: Lawrence Scheele)\n\nPlacement site to be reviewed from next year\n\nIn a statement, a Port of Townsville spokesperson said it would consider \"community feedback\" on where to put the dredge spoil as part of its next management plan.\n\n\"We are currently preparing for our next 10-year sea placement application,\" they said.\n\n\"As part of our commitment to best practice, we will review all available science, community feedback and regulatory guidance as part of the application process.\"",

        "text": "There are few who fly under the radar as much as Australian athlete Claudia Hollingsworth.\n\nThe humble 20-year-old is part of the golden-age record 88 Australian athletes that will start at the World Athletics Championships, beginning on Saturday in Tokyo.\n\nThe Olympic semi-finalist has been building all year for the championships, last month smashing the Australian 800m record at the Silesia Diamond League in a time of 1 minute, 57.67 seconds, bringing down Catriona Bisset's mark from two years ago.\n\nThat run also placed her 14th for the year among the women's 800 metres, and saw a world lead, another national record, and five other personal bests among a star-studded field of competitors.\n\n\"I feel like [the] sky is the limit,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\n\"Having Abbey [Caldwell] there and giving each other a hug after the race was really special,\" she said of breaking the Oceania record.\n\n\"And to get the record was amazing, and being in such a huge [stadium], with the crowds so big was great atmosphere and a great place to do it.\"\n\nWith the depth in Australian athletics, it's no surprise that Hollingsworth \u2014 who already has a silver medal from the 2024 World Athletics U20 Championships \u2014 will be joined by an Aussie cohort of Abbey Caldwell and Jessica Hull in Japan.\n\n\"I think it's awesome. We've pushed each other to these fast times,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\n\"And I think it's great seeing how many girls are running 1:58 or sub, and I know we can all go a lot quicker, and we're going to do that by helping each other.\n\n\"Seeing other people race just as fast and maybe faster is really motivating.\n\n\" The last few races have given me a lot of confidence going into the world champs, reiterating that I'm up there with the best in the world. \"\n\nSuch is the depth in track running that Sarah Billings (1:57.83), Georgia Griffith (1:59.22), Bendere Oboya (1:59.27) and Tess Kirsopp-Cole (1:59.95) have all broken through the sub-2 minute mark this year, while Bissett (former record holder) missed out on selection.\n\nOlympic medallists and Gout Gout join biggest Australian team for world champs Photo shows Gout Gout runs in a 200m race. Australian Athletics names its biggest-ever team for a global meet, with five Paris Olympic medallists and teenage sensation Gout Gout among an 88-strong squad.\n\nSuch is the pressure on the global stage, that no Australian woman has ever made the final in the 800m at the World Championships, with Caldwell falling agonisingly short by .06 seconds in the semi-finals at the last championships.\n\nInternally, the expectations for the youngest of them all, Hollingsworth to use the European summer and go to another level at Tokyo are high.\n\n\"Competing in those Diamond Leagues, putting yourself in those fields where they will be either in the final or at least the semi-final and, practising racing against those girls,\" she said.\n\n\"Each learning experience has really helped.\"\n\nHollingsworth doesn't shy away from the pressure she places on herself, looking to the future of her career.\n\n\"Going to LA, and Brisbane, making an Olympic final and medalling or being on the podium is a huge goal for me.\n\n\"I think a little bit [that the] sky's the limit. I'm going to the world champs, with I guess, expectations on myself, but also just to go out there and see how far I can go.\n\n\"I just want to take it race by race and each day by day in training, and I'm sure those goals will slowly start getting ticked off.\n\n\"The experience I get from Craig [coach Craig Mottram] is sort of unmatched and I try listening, take as much of that on board as I can.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nMaster and apprentice deal with pressures\n\nA four-time Olympian, Mottram has been coaching Hollingsworth since she was 12 and says her development on and off the track is different to other athletes he's coached.\n\n\"I think she's got a very strong personality; she's very resilient, she's grounded, she has a great family,\" Mottram said.\n\n\"She's got an exceptional ability \u2014 physically and mentally \u2014 to perform at the highest possible level, but in doing so keeps things very realistic and has a good time doing it.\n\n\"She's shown me a lot around the development of a young athlete, keeping a balance in life, having a home life and keeping consistency with things that you love doing.\n\n\"You can do all of that and still be one of the best in the world.\"\n\nMottram, who still holds the Australian men's 5,000m record set in 2004, knows what the pressure is like to be ahead of the pack, guiding Hollingsworth with a trusted relationship that has been built from hard work, frank conversations and understanding.\n\n\"We've had a few sit-downs over the years where we've spoken about expectations and what the sport of athletics is like, and what it's like in school versus what it's like internationally on a global scale,\" he said.\n\n\"I've obviously had a lot of experience through my 17\u201318 years of running at a high level.\n\n\"So sharing that with her I think gives her the knowledge and understanding that she can obviously go on and do it, and it gives a little bit of comfort.\n\n\"But also knowing the world of sport and athletics in particular has changed a lot \u2014 when I was running, records were not broken as frequently as they are at the moment.\n\n\" So I think it's just part of the development of our sport. And for Claudia in particular, I think she's broken her first record recently and she'll break many more to come. \"\n\nDespite all the success in Hollingsworth's young career, Mottram said what he sees on the track is only second to life off the track for the prodigy.\n\n\"Running in my opinion, is second to her as a person.\n\n\"I think if she keeps true to that she'll be fantastic and will do great things.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nJellybeans the keys to success for high-achieving family\n\nAs Hollingsworth gets a rare moment back on home soil, she embraces all that got her there \u2014 her family.\n\n\"I've come from a family that's just always told us to try our best and try everything,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I remember Dad saying when we joined high school, just give everything a go and give it your best shot.\n\n\"I think just having that attitude towards everything in life has really driven me and given me that determination and sort of expectations on myself.\n\n\"But if things don't go to plan, then [showing] that resilience to try again and not give up.\"\n\nFrom a twin sister, Gemma, who's been on stage for musicals such as Legally Blonde and on TV screens on The Voice, to another sister Sunday, a trampolinist on the global stage, both have helped show Claudia a pathway to taking on the world in her own way.\n\n\"It's not like a pushy family or anything like that. We all drive ourselves, so it's not really coming from Mum and Dad,\" she said.\n\n\"[They're] just there to support and give us a hug at the end of the day.\"\n\nThose hugs from Mum started with packed lunches growing up, where extra jellybeans were snuck in for a boost for swimming meets, athletics carnivals or \"just a bad day at school\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nFrom there it stuck as a superstition, especially orange, purple and red flavours.\n\n\"I started having three or four jellybeans before every cross-country race and I just couldn't stop,\" she said.\n\n\" Maybe it's a good luck charm. It's fuel, it's energy. Getting any sort of lollies in before the race is important \u2026 I take a few bags overseas. \"\n\nAfter attending a training camp in Cairns, Hollingsworth now turns her focus to performing in the green and gold again, with heats beginning on Thursday, September 17 in the evening, and aiming for the breakthrough into the final on the Sunday night, October 21.\n\n\"Yeah, it's amazing. I feel so grateful and passionate every time I get to wear the uniform,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\n\"It's such an honour, and to know you're representing your whole country, it's not something everyone gets to do. When you get to do it, it's just incredible.\n\n\"On the start line, you feel like you have a responsibility and a job to do for the country.\n\n\"You want to make everyone proud and everyone watching.\n\n\"So yeah, it's just a lot of pride and excitement and I can't wait to get out there and see what I can do.\"",

        "text": "The start of spring in Western Australia is heralded by rolling fields of golden canola that light up the countryside from the Midwest down to the South Coast.\n\nThe impressive crop draws attention from photographers around the world and can even be seen from space.\n\nRecent satellite images capturing the crop have been highlighted by the Grains Research and Development Commission (GRDC).\n\nBut the paddocks of gold were not a part of WA's landscape until the 1960s, when canola was introduced from Canada.\n\nA canola field just outside of Northam, north-east of Perth. (Supplied: Cameron Hanks Photography)\n\nThe crop did not thrive in Australian conditions, so breeding programs began in the 1970s to develop varieties with better disease resistance and oil quality.\n\nGRDC WA regional manager Peter Bird said the introduction of herbicide-tolerant canola two decades later was \"really what kicked things off\".\n\n\"It's a crop you can't use herbicides on in its natural state, but it's also been a very temperamental type of crop,\" he said.\n\n\"The bugs love to eat it and a disease called blackleg and other diseases kind of wiped it out in these early years.\"\n\nThe Milky Way glows above a field of bright yellow canola in York, north of Perth. (Supplied: Paul Goh)\n\nMr Bird said strong investment in improving soil health and disease management in WA had led to canola becoming a \"reliable\" crop that could be grown in medium and low rainfall areas.\n\n\"It's been a really great success story for Western Australian farmers and now it's a big crop,\" he said.\n\nStrong canola forecast\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Science's September Crop Report forecasts Australia will produce about 6.4 million tonnes of canola this year, 34 per cent above the 10-year average.\n\nThe report predicts WA will contribute 3.3 million tonnes, accounting for more than 50 per cent of the nation's production.\n\nCanola is grown between WA's Mid West and South Coast. (ABC Great Southern: Rhys Jones)\n\nMr Bird said most of WA's canola was exported to countries in Europe, the United Arab Emirates and South East Asia, generating about $1.2 billion annually for the state's economy.\n\nCanola generates billions of dollars for the Australian economy. (Supplied: Sprinkle Tinny)\n\nIncreasingly, canola oil is also manufactured into biofuel, a more environmentally-friendly fuel alternative, which Mr Bird said had been driving the price of canola higher than usual.\n\nGalaxy photos\n\nPerth-based photographer Paul Goh has been drawn to canola for years and recently started experimenting with astrophotography to enhance his pictures.\n\nPaul Goh has been experimenting with astrophotography of the canola fields near York. (Supplied: Paul Goh)\n\nHe said there was something special about the golden fields.\n\n\"Often [WA] is known for our minerals industry, but our agricultural industry, I feel, is just as important,\" he said.\n\n\" Canola is part of the Australian and Western Australian identity. \"\n\nMr Goh said he reminded people to be \"respectful of boundaries and the biosecurity of canola\" when he shared photos of fields to his social media platforms.\n\n\"It's certainly not worth contaminating or putting the crop at risk just to get the shot,\" he said.\n\nWA is forecast to produce more than 50 per cent of Australia's canola this year. (ABC Great Southern: Rhys Jones)\n\nMr Goh said he would probably head out again to the canola fields of York, 97 kilometres east of Perth, chasing the thrill of the perfect shot.\n\n\"When you see that first preview on the back of the screen and it looks how you intended it \u2014 the colours are vivid, the Milky Way looks clear \u2014 it's such a wonderful feeling,\" he said.\n\n\"You almost just want to get home and start editing straight away.\"\n\nCanola fields can be found in the Great Southern region of WA. (ABC Great Southern: Rhys Jones)\n\nHow's this season?\n\nThe Esperance region, 700 kilometres south-east of Perth, is the leading canola-producing area in the country.\n\nCascade farmer Mark Walter grows about 2,000 hectares of canola, west of Esperance.\n\nWhile reluctant to predict an exact figure, he believed his farm was on track for its best canola crop.\n\nCanola fields in the Esperance region can be seen from space. (Supplied: Digital Agriculture Services)\n\n\"We had a really good early start [with] 40 millimetres [of rain] through March, so seeded a reasonable amount of the canola early,\" he said.\n\n\"And then had 120 millimetres around Easter time, so we reseeded 700 hectares and the rest went in after that.\"\n\nCanola is exported as oil to South East Asia, the United Arab Emirates and Europe. (ABC Great Southern: Rhys Jones)\n\nEpasco Farms manager Nick Ruddenklau, who grows canola in Condingup, said it was a rocky start to the season.\n\nBut the forecast was \"looking really good\".\n\n\"The last two seasons were really short springs and that really knocked things around,\" Mr Ruddenklau said.\n\n\"So definitely more confident going into this spring with [hopefully] another rain in September, and another one in early October would be good.\"",

But no one braced me for comedy.\n\nEarlier this year, pop star Chappell Roan came under fire when she said the quiet bit out loud: she doesn\u2019t know anyone with children who is happy, and those that have children \u201care in hell\u201d. Are we surprised that Western civilisation is suffering from cataclysmic population shrinkage if that\u2019s what pop stars are telling young fans? Who wants to willingly enter into 18 years of \u201chell\u201d?\n\nYou have to laugh: Charlotte Mortlock with her baby.\n\nIt\u2019s now likely we will see the global population starting to decline by the 2050s, just a few decades away. In Australia, this trend began in 2014, and we are now at a near-record low of 1.5 babies per woman, the lowest in almost two decades. In England and Wales, births have declined to a record low, and Japan, one of the worst-affected countries, is experiencing a net loss of 100 people each hour.\n\nSome will argue this will be good for the environment, but it will be catastrophic for economies, the vulnerable and the ageing with a smaller workforce burdened with covering nations\u2019 taxes of and providing the labour and productivity needed to sustain them. Countries will be heavily dependent on migrants (even more so than now) and will likely compete to poach the most skilled and brightest from developing countries.",

We order gnocchi, spinach and steak tartare to share. McCune is the one to suggest ordering the latter, and when it arrives with a side of crisps, she looks at it with interest. \u201cMy kids would love this,\u201d she says, explaining that for her, normally she tends towards vegetables and beans. \u201cI\u2019m challenging my palette,\u201d she adds with a smile, mixing the egg into the steak. She takes a bite and a small piece falls on her plate. \u201cOh, disaster!\u201d she says, and then: \u201cIt is really good.\u201d McCune is warm, easy to laugh, and occasionally puckish. When photographer Simon Schluter arrives, they greet each other warmly \u2013 they\u2019ve worked together before \u2013 and after he\u2019s taken a few shots through the window, she looks through at him, says, \u201cooh he\u2019ll hate this\u201d, then carefully spoons a wad of spinach in front of her top teeth and shoots him a wide grin.\n\nMcCune was born in Sydney, grew up in Perth, trained at WAAPA and then acting brought her to Melbourne where she still lives. From a young age, her interest was quite firmly fixed on musical theatre, so she originally thought that was where her career would be headed. \u201cI came out of drama school, and I got a great agent, and she said to me, I think you\u2019re going to do work in television. And I was like, \u2018Oh, I hadn\u2019t thought about that\u2019.\u201d One of her first jobs was a series of ads for Coles supermarkets. \u201cI remember just being so utterly excited by what the camera could do and how that worked.\u201d Soon afterwards, she was cast in Blue Heelers where she quickly became a household name. \u201cProfessionally for me, I was exposed to a lot of really great writers, a lot of really good actors and directors,\u201d she reflects. \u201cSo as a young actor, it\u2019s a fantastic place to be because just in and out of the door every week were really great people who were at the top of their game [which] taught me a lot about humility and about working hard and always being respectful.\u201d Lisa McCune in a scene from Blue Heelers in 1995. Her love of collaboration has carried through the decades that followed. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those actors that is desperate to do a one-person show,\u201d she says. \u201cI love working with people.\u201d\n\nThe 39 Steps has four actors performing a large number of roles. \u201cI think it makes people laugh because it\u2019s so mad \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of shadow play, lots of old theatrical tricks to create illusions.\u201d Lisa McCune and Ian Stenlake in a scene from The 39 Steps. Credit: Cameron Grant The play is inspired by the 1935 Hitchcock film, which in turn was adapted from John Buchan\u2019s 1915 novel. McCune stars alongside Ian Stenlake, David Collins and Shane Dundas \u2013 the latter two perhaps better known as The Umbilical Brothers. \u201cI\u2019ve been so inspired by the team on 39 Steps,\u201d McCune says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so enjoyable creatively\u201d. As we make our way through the plate of gnocchi, the conversation hops from technology (\u201cI subscribe to this thing called The Rundown \u2013 it\u2019s a newsletter that comes out pretty much every day about AI and what\u2019s happening on that day, because it\u2019s just changing so much\u201d), to gardening and the price of coffee. McCune\u2019s quiet but sharp curiosity and interest in stories spills out beyond her acting. Across the course of the meal, she looks around and wonders about the other people around us \u2013 whether they work nearby, whether they are local, whether this is their first time eating here or if it\u2019s a favourite spot of theirs.\n\nShe tells me about the book she\u2019s reading \u2013 about photographer Max Dupain \u2013 and about a recent visit to the remounted French Impressionism Exhibition at the NGV. Loading \u201cThere was this really interesting man, and he had a seat with him. He sat, and he was writing copious notes in a tiny notebook,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd when he stood up to move away from the painting, I said to him, \u2018Hello, I find you just as fascinating as the painting. What are you doing?\u2019\u201d The man explained that he was an academic with a focus on art and that he studied the Impressionists. From there, they went on to talk about the paintings around them. When something grabs her interest, she doesn\u2019t let it stop at curiosity \u2013 she digs in and asks questions. \u201cI just gather bizarre knowledge,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cThe other day, I stopped in Sydney to talk to some stonemasons working on a building early in the morning. I went up to the gardens to go for a walk \u2026 and they told me all about this building they were working on. And then that sent me kind of looking for a book about it.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI love that moment of going, \u2018oh, my God, I didn\u2019t know that\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis curiosity extends to her family history. About a decade back, she was the subject of an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? which traced multiple generations of McCune\u2019s family. Since then, \u201cevery summer when I\u2019ve got a bit of a break over that Christmas period, I\u2019ll delve into it\u201d. The bill at The European. Credit: When her research uncovered an address, \u201cI went and knocked on the door in Elsternwick, and the guy that lived there said, \u2018Yeah, that family did live here!\u2019, and he invited the old lady down the road,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe came down one Sunday, and we all sat around and she told me about her memories of the family,\u201d she pauses. \u201cOral history opens up doors that I think a lot of written history doesn\u2019t hold.\u201d Each year has a different shape for McCune. \u201cI just wake up every day and just think, what\u2019s the phone call that\u2019s going to come today?\u201d The time in between, however, is very full. There\u2019s her family, her production company, and a driving curiosity that often sends her down a chain of reading and research and questioning.",

        "text": "The increase lifted his total net worth to $US383.2 billion. It\u2019s the biggest one-day increase ever recorded, and put him ahead of Musk for much of the day before the Tesla CEO edged back into pole position by $US1 billion. How did Ellison make his fortune on Oracle? Raised on the south side of Chicago after being adopted by his mother\u2019s aunt and uncle when he was nine months old, Ellison dropped out of both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago and moved to Berkeley, California, taking a computer programming job at Ampex, where he worked on a database called Oracle for the Central Intelligence Agency. Ellison has also benefited from a close relationship with US President Donald Trump. Credit: Bloomberg With two partners, Ellison founded in 1977 what eventually became Oracle. The company sold shares in an initial public offering on March 12, 1986, a day before Microsoft\u2019s IPO. He stepped down as Oracle\u2019s chief executive officer in September 2014, taking on the titles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nLoading Why is Oracle having a moment right now? Oracle has invested billions of dollars over the past few years to become a provider of cloud infrastructure, offering computing power and storage over the internet. The firm has benefited from the enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as start-ups and other AI firms seek more capacity. As of early September, Oracle\u2019s share price had tripled since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. It hit an all-time high after market close in New York on September 9, as Oracle provided an aggressive outlook for its cloud business that surprised Wall Street and galvanised hopes that the global build-out of AI infrastructure is accelerating. It was a win for a company that was already having a good year. In July, Oracle inked an unprecedented commitment with ChatGPT operator OpenAI for 4.5 gigawatts worth of data-centre capacity \u2013 enough energy to power millions of American homes. Oracle also counts companies such as Nvidia and ByteDance\u2019s TikTok as major cloud customers. Taken together, this shows how Oracle is emerging as a key provider of such computing capacity, competing with cloud leaders Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet\u2019s Google.\n\nEllison has also benefited from a close relationship with US President Donald Trump. Ellison has been a Trump supporter and Republican donor for years. Since Trump returned to office in January, he\u2019s rewarded Ellison by elevating Oracle on multiple occasions. Ellison also owns a stake in Tesla. Credit: Bloomberg Ellison and Oracle are part of a $US500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate that Trump first touted in January. Trump has expressed support for Oracle to acquire a partial stake in the US business of TikTok, which would give Oracle a share of one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products. Oracle\u2019s bid for the popular video app owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, which includes several other potential investors, has been endorsed by Trump, but hasn\u2019t been approved by the Chinese government. What other businesses does Ellison own? He\u2019s spent hundreds of millions of dollars on luxury real estate in the past decade, including properties in Malibu and Rancho Mirage in California; the Beechwood Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island; and an estate in the San Francisco Bay Area modelled on 16th century Japanese feudal architecture.\n\nEllison has been a major shareholder of Tesla and owned about 1.5 per cent of the company as of the carmaker\u2019s 2022 proxy statement. He stepped down from Tesla\u2019s board of directors in June that year, and his stake hasn\u2019t been disclosed in subsequent filings. He was also one of the largest outside backers of Musk\u2019s bid to purchase Twitter, which has since been renamed X. What are Ellison\u2019s interests outside of tech? The software mogul has a history of lavish living. In a 2002 email to the tech founder, an accountant suggested that Ellison \u201cbudget and plan\u201d because his spending habits were becoming difficult to sustain, according to a January 2006 San Francisco Chronicle article. Ellison finances his lifestyle using debt and the proceeds from Oracle stock sales and dividends, which have amounted to more than $US12 billion since 2003, according to an analysis of data compiled by Bloomberg. He\u2019s an avid sailor and partially financed the BMW Oracle Racing team, which won the America\u2019s Cup in February 2010. He sold his stake in Rising Sun, a 138-metre megayacht, to billionaire David Geffen later that year. Ellison\u2019s Oracle Team USA defended the America\u2019s Cup in October 2013, defeating a team from New Zealand. He signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, promising to give away at least 95 per cent of his wealth to charitable causes.\n\nLoading How has Ellison been involved in Hawaii? Ellison\u2019s love for Hawaii, which began in his childhood, led to his $US300 million purchase of 98 per cent of the island of Lanai in 2012. There, he\u2019s partnered with David Agus \u2013 a doctor who treated Ellison\u2019s late best friend, Steve Jobs \u2013 to create Sensei, a chain of luxury wellness resorts focused on longevity. His personal connections have brought high-profile visitors including Musk, Hollywood actor Tom Cruise and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the once-sleepy island. Ellison\u2019s supporters have said his investments have helped revitalise Lanai but there have been complaints that the island has become more hospitable to the super-rich while squeezing out families that have lived there for generations.

        "text": "He was the only one who crossed the boundaries of civility. Those boundaries are necessary to avoid unnecessary drama around the whole unusual interaction that occurs daily between athletes and everyone else in professional sport. No potential defence stacks up. Bailey Smith, Max Holmes and Gryan Miers. Credit: Getty Images Why did he choose to pick on a local photographer who has done her job well and without drama for 25 years? If he wanted privacy for the massage, get it done inside the rooms. Or head to Mars (Stadium).\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t possible and it was an issue, ask a media official or football manager whether the photographer could refrain from taking a photo at that point. If Smith was having a bad day, that\u2019s life. I can bet with certainty there were people within the stadium that day who had personal battles of their own. We all want Smith to feel well, given the mental health struggles he has shared. But having mental health issues doesn\u2019t mean anyone should get a pass for bad behaviour. That\u2019s a stereotype better left to history.\n\nSo it comes back to a basic question: why? It would be the same question you would ask a mate if he turned up at your party and abused one of your lifelong friends. If he or she then wondered why you were making such a fuss, then you wouldn\u2019t invite them back. Perhaps Smith just has a reality TV star\u2019s penchant for drama, and we are all being played. But Wynd, the News Corp photographer, was not being intrusive. She wasn\u2019t doorstopping, nor pointing her lens into a space thousands of cameras haven\u2019t been before.\n\nStill, Smith treated her like a paparazzi photographer, using demeaning language to show his disdain. It was, to use a word Jack Ginnivan deployed well when doorstopped in Adelaide, embarrassing. It\u2019s not as though media people wilt either. Wynd and others are used to the cut and thrust that comes with being in this business. But we all know when a line is crossed. It would be unfair to write that Geelong have let Smith get away with this sort of petulance. They are working hard to shift his behaviour in the right direction, as the Western Bulldogs did before them. Geelong are choosing to do so in the background rather than via a public dressing down or punitive measures. That\u2019s fine. I respect that strategy. But the Cats\u2019 brand, one they have been working hard to maintain, is taking a hit as a result.\n\nEveryone knows Smith\u2019s form on the field has people inside the club contorting themselves to explain his positive attributes, of which, it must be said, there are many. That is unfortunate because the players are among the finer groups in the competition, respected within the community and outside the club, a legacy built over 20 years at least. They continue to look after their mate and he could show some gratitude for that. The best way to do that is through his actions. Coach Chris Scott is in a tough position too, but his intent is to help Smith through rather than bow to the baying mob, who want Smith to pay publicly. It\u2019s a strength of Scott\u2019s and preferable to the punitive approach the AFL takes. However, he can no longer rate Smith\u2019s season a 10/10 because that well-meaning show of support doesn\u2019t pass the pub test \u2013 or any other test for that matter, although I respect his obligation to defend his player.\n\nLoading Smith won\u2019t be the first or the last with a dim view of the mainstream media, particularly as the world fragments. But if he\u2019s smart, he will learn how to deal with people inside a stadium a community built. Because when mainstream media are invited into GMHBA Stadium, they don\u2019t leave their phones or cameras in a basket at the front door. Right now, Smith\u2019s big-city attitudes aren\u2019t going down well. Geelong want to embrace him. For the most part, they have. They want to protect him from intrusion as he tries to enjoy the best the coast has to offer. He\u2019s helping them in the quest for a premiership and is a Brownlow chance.",

She moved to clarify her remarks , saying she was highlighting general concern for Labor's \"mass migration agenda\" and when pushed on this further on Wednesday, said they were \"clumsy\" but again did not apologise. She also refused to endorse Ley's leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nHours later, Price was dumped from the frontbench, with Ley saying the Northern Territory senator had failed to uphold the standards she had set as leader. The Opposition leader said Price had refused to apologise for her remarks that caused Indian Australians \"significant hurt\", and refused to endorse her leadership, which had made her position untenable.\n\n\n\nPrice said she accepted the decision, adding she regretted not being clearer when making the comments initially and that she \"never intended to be disparaging towards our Indian community\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My concern is not migration itself \u2014 it\u2019s the magnitude of migration,\" Price said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she would \"continue to speak up on issues which are in the national interest\" from the backbench.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey on Thursday wouldn't divulge her \"private discussions\" with Price, but said she remained a \"valued member\" of the Liberal Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Price] has contributed much in public policy and debate in this country and will continue to do so,\" Ley said.\n\n\n\nLey said a decision on Price's replacement in the Opposition cabinet will be made in due course.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice was Opposition spokesperson for defence industry until her demotion.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition finance spokesman James Paterson said the axing was disappointing, but was confident his Senate colleague would return to a prominent position within the Liberal party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was self-evidently not an edifying week for the Liberal Party and we are concerned about the way in which Indian Australians heard that discussion and felt about that,\" he told Sky News on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Political careers are not linear any more, they have fits and starts, forward steps and back steps, and I'm confident that Jacinta will be back in a prominent role in the front bench.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy opposition leader Ted O'Brien said while Price had the freedom to speak out on issues, her comments had to be dealt with and Ley made the right decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Words can sometimes be positive and help someone out, or words can hurt, and I think we all have to be mindful, no matter what we do in life, to try to choose our words as best as we can.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice had defected from the Nationals to sit in the Liberal party room, shortly after the Coalition's election defeat in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the heat of Honiara, Pacific leaders and diplomats are gathering in the Solomon Islands capital for the region's paramount political meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh on the agenda for this year's forum is stronger action on climate change, maintaining regional security, and a review of regional partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is one of, if not the most pressing, security threats faced by Pacific Island nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs China and Australia compete for influence in the region, Climate Council Researcher Wesley Morgan says strong climate action could help Australia cement its position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is deeply concerned about China's growing influence in the region. So in 2022 China signed a security deal with Solomon Islands, and Australia is keen to avoid a situation where other countries sign security deals with China. For their part, Pacific Island countries are crystal clear that climate change is their single greatest security threat. So if Australia is to really cement its place as a security partner for Pacific governments, Australia will need to be taking action to address climate change, and that means setting as strong a target as possible to cut emissions over the next decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne outcome expected at the 2025 Forum is the establishment of the region's new climate fund, The Pacific Resilience Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to be signed and ratified during the summit, the fund is the first Pacific-led, owned, and managed financing mechanism in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure is also on the Australian government to secure the hosting rights for the next annual COP31 Climate Summit, which Turkiye is now also bidding for.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says climate action is key to credibility in the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will contribute an initial $100 million I have confirmed for that. This is more than a fund, it's a promise to Pacific communities they will not face climate threats alone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn regional security, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he will negotiate an upgrade to the security agreement with Fiji.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese skipped day one of the forum for a detour to Vanuatu, where he failed to sign a long-awaited security and development deal with Vanuatu.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the future of the Nakamal agreement hanging in the balance, Vanuatu's leadership says concerns persist over the deals possible impact on their ability to accept foreign funding for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased in Vanuatu, Dr Tess Newton-Cain is an Adjunct Associate Professor at the Griffith Asia Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Their impetus, their main driver, is to ensure that they have available to them the resources that they need to guarantee human security in Vanuatu, and that means working with a wide range of partners, and they do not see in their short to medium term, they do not see any scope for entering into something that would limit the choice of partners they work with .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous security agreement in 2022, which would have given Australia power to veto Chinese investment in Vanuatu's critical infrastructure, failed to materialise in 2022 over similar concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Newton-Cain says that Australia has the opportunity to prove itself as a friend to Vanuatu by giving them time to find an agreement that benefits both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bearing in mind what happened in 2022, Australia knows that you need to kind of commit to the process, and that it's not a single swipe of a pen, that there is going to be that need for the Vanuatu leadership to have satisfied its own people, the opposition and the community at large, that there has been sufficient consultation and that Vanuatu interests are being protected.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, Chinese military presence has reached new levels in the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom staging a live fire military exercise in the waters between Australia and New Zealand to conducting its first intercontinental ballistic missile test in the Pacific since 1980, China has not been coy about its strategic interests in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoel Nilon is the Pacific Fellow at the Pacific Security College at the Australian National University.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says one key outcome expected at the forum is the signing of Fiji's proposed 'Ocean of Peace' Declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" This will be a declaration that is about sort of ensuring the region remain a sort of zone of peace free from conflict. It will set out a number of principles, you know, related to prevention of conflicts, upholding the rule of law, not only for foreign countries, but also for partners.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the summit, China gifted the Solomon Islands a fleet of 27 new vehicles to drive delegates around during the forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same day, Australia also gifted the Solomon Islands a fleet of 61 new police vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal papers on the Pacific nation ran two full page articles about the gifted vehicles, side by side, headlined almost identically.\n\n\n\n\n\nMihai Sora is Program Director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says these gifts are a way to build relationships from the outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's the vector by which they can increase the influence with the relevant local security actors, in the absence of the military in Solomon Islands, for example, or Navy. They use the police force to build up those relationships ... So that's really that's that's really the dynamics that's that's at play there. For Australia, one concern is also that you know in accommodating an increased Chinese security presence, established relationships that Australia has that are sanctioned by the Pacific Islands Forum would be sort of elbowed out. You know, there's only so much bandwidth for a trusted partner and so hence China and Australia are vying to be that trusted partner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key agenda item is a review of regional partnerships in the Pacific, which will look at how regional meetings operate and even how external partners engage with the forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pacific Island Forum has 18 full members and around two dozen external partners, including China, Taiwan and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nSparking backlash, this year's host and ally of China the Solomon Islands, opted not to invite any external partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the official reasoning cited the unfinished review of regional partnerships, Mihai Sora says he believes it was done appease China, as well as other members who recognise Taiwan.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A breakthrough vaccine for a common sexually transmitted disease has provided fresh hope for Australia's most beloved endangered animal \u2014 and maybe a blueprint for human use.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent more than a decade developing a single-use vaccine for chlamydia in koalas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter habitat loss and vehicle strikes, chlamydia is one of the main threats to koala populations , leading to blindness, pneumonia, urinary and reproductive tract infections, infertility and death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chlamydial disease affects 50 per cent or more of all koala populations, so we need a new tool,\" said professor Peter Timms, from the university's Centre for Bioinnovation.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fewer than 200 wild koalas survive near this NSW town. The locals hope to change that\n\nThe vaccine has been approved by the national regulator, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medical Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimms said studies on koala populations using the vaccine over a 10-year period had shown reduced rates of disease and improved health outcomes, particularly for animals of breeding age.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe hoped the vaccine would begin to be rolled out early in 2026, starting with koalas in wildlife hospitals before progressing to wild populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimms said there was evidence that koalas became more vulnerable to chlamydia outbreaks because of long-term stress caused by habitat loss, bushfires and drought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have got examples in places like northern NSW where chlamydia infection levels have gone from very low to nearly 80 (per cent),\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhile increased rates of chlamydial disease were related to fragmentation of koala populations due to land clearing, Timms said habitat loss remained the greatest threat to the koala's survival overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The problem with trees is that it takes a long time for them to grow, whereas a vaccine for chlamydial treatment can work immediately,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimms said the development of the vaccine had the potential to help in the fight against chlamydia in humans.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization estimated that in 2020, there were more than 128 million new infections among people aged 15-49 globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rest of the world is interested in what we're doing in the koala space, so there's lessons to be learned from a koala vaccine that could be translated across to vaccines in humans as well,\" Timms said.\n\n\n\n",

But no one braced me for comedy.\n\nEarlier this year, pop star Chappell Roan came under fire when she said the quiet bit out loud: she doesn\u2019t know anyone with children who is happy, and those that have children \u201care in hell\u201d. Are we surprised that Western civilisation is suffering from cataclysmic population shrinkage if that\u2019s what pop stars are telling young fans? Who wants to willingly enter into 18 years of \u201chell\u201d?\n\nYou have to laugh: Charlotte Mortlock with her baby.\n\nIt\u2019s now likely we will see the global population starting to decline by the 2050s, just a few decades away. In Australia, this trend began in 2014, and we are now at a near-record low of 1.5 babies per woman, the lowest in almost two decades. In England and Wales, births have declined to a record low, and Japan, one of the worst-affected countries, is experiencing a net loss of 100 people each hour.\n\nSome will argue this will be good for the environment, but it will be catastrophic for economies, the vulnerable and the ageing with a smaller workforce burdened with covering nations\u2019 taxes of and providing the labour and productivity needed to sustain them. Countries will be heavily dependent on migrants (even more so than now) and will likely compete to poach the most skilled and brightest from developing countries.",

Right now, she is working her way through the city\u2019s different op shops to find different images of flowers. \u201cI\u2019m a real bowerbird,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when people donate things like their grandmother\u2019s old floral paintings that she did for some competition. I\u2019ve got this beautiful tiny gold one, and it\u2019s golden sunflowers in this really ornate frame.\u201d Sauteed spinach and gnocchi pomodoro Credit: Simon Schluter The idea of wanting to try new things, to not be predictable, is something that comes up again in different ways across the afternoon. We order gnocchi, spinach and steak tartare to share. McCune is the one to suggest ordering the latter, and when it arrives with a side of crisps, she looks at it with interest. \u201cMy kids would love this,\u201d she says, explaining that for her, normally she tends towards vegetables and beans. \u201cI\u2019m challenging my palette,\u201d she adds with a smile, mixing the egg into the steak. She takes a bite and a small piece falls on her plate. \u201cOh, disaster!\u201d she says, and then: \u201cIt is really good.\u201d McCune is warm, easy to laugh, and occasionally puckish. When photographer Simon Schluter arrives, they greet each other warmly \u2013 they\u2019ve worked together before \u2013 and after he\u2019s taken a few shots through the window, she looks through at him, says, \u201cooh he\u2019ll hate this\u201d, then carefully spoons a wad of spinach in front of her top teeth and shoots him a wide grin.\n\nMcCune was born in Sydney, grew up in Perth, trained at WAAPA and then acting brought her to Melbourne where she still lives. From a young age, her interest was quite firmly fixed on musical theatre, so she originally thought that was where her career would be headed. \u201cI came out of drama school, and I got a great agent, and she said to me, I think you\u2019re going to do work in television. And I was like, \u2018Oh, I hadn\u2019t thought about that\u2019.\u201d One of her first jobs was a series of ads for Coles supermarkets. \u201cI remember just being so utterly excited by what the camera could do and how that worked.\u201d Soon afterwards, she was cast in Blue Heelers where she quickly became a household name. \u201cProfessionally for me, I was exposed to a lot of really great writers, a lot of really good actors and directors,\u201d she reflects. \u201cSo as a young actor, it\u2019s a fantastic place to be because just in and out of the door every week were really great people who were at the top of their game [which] taught me a lot about humility and about working hard and always being respectful.\u201d Lisa McCune in a scene from Blue Heelers in 1995. Her love of collaboration has carried through the decades that followed. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those actors that is desperate to do a one-person show,\u201d she says. \u201cI love working with people.\u201d\n\nThe 39 Steps has four actors performing a large number of roles. \u201cI think it makes people laugh because it\u2019s so mad \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of shadow play, lots of old theatrical tricks to create illusions.\u201d Lisa McCune and Ian Stenlake in a scene from The 39 Steps. Credit: Cameron Grant The play is inspired by the 1935 Hitchcock film, which in turn was adapted from John Buchan\u2019s 1915 novel. McCune stars alongside Ian Stenlake, David Collins and Shane Dundas \u2013 the latter two perhaps better known as The Umbilical Brothers. \u201cI\u2019ve been so inspired by the team on 39 Steps,\u201d McCune says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so enjoyable creatively\u201d. As we make our way through the plate of gnocchi, the conversation hops from technology (\u201cI subscribe to this thing called The Rundown \u2013 it\u2019s a newsletter that comes out pretty much every day about AI and what\u2019s happening on that day, because it\u2019s just changing so much\u201d), to gardening and the price of coffee. McCune\u2019s quiet but sharp curiosity and interest in stories spills out beyond her acting. Across the course of the meal, she looks around and wonders about the other people around us \u2013 whether they work nearby, whether they are local, whether this is their first time eating here or if it\u2019s a favourite spot of theirs.\n\nShe tells me about the book she\u2019s reading \u2013 about photographer Max Dupain \u2013 and about a recent visit to the remounted French Impressionism Exhibition at the NGV. Loading \u201cThere was this really interesting man, and he had a seat with him. He sat, and he was writing copious notes in a tiny notebook,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd when he stood up to move away from the painting, I said to him, \u2018Hello, I find you just as fascinating as the painting. What are you doing?\u2019\u201d The man explained that he was an academic with a focus on art and that he studied the Impressionists. From there, they went on to talk about the paintings around them. When something grabs her interest, she doesn\u2019t let it stop at curiosity \u2013 she digs in and asks questions. \u201cI just gather bizarre knowledge,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cThe other day, I stopped in Sydney to talk to some stonemasons working on a building early in the morning. I went up to the gardens to go for a walk \u2026 and they told me all about this building they were working on. And then that sent me kind of looking for a book about it.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI love that moment of going, \u2018oh, my God, I didn\u2019t know that\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis curiosity extends to her family history. About a decade back, she was the subject of an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? which traced multiple generations of McCune\u2019s family. Since then, \u201cevery summer when I\u2019ve got a bit of a break over that Christmas period, I\u2019ll delve into it\u201d. The bill at The European. Credit: When her research uncovered an address, \u201cI went and knocked on the door in Elsternwick, and the guy that lived there said, \u2018Yeah, that family did live here!\u2019, and he invited the old lady down the road,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe came down one Sunday, and we all sat around and she told me about her memories of the family,\u201d she pauses. \u201cOral history opens up doors that I think a lot of written history doesn\u2019t hold.\u201d Each year has a different shape for McCune. \u201cI just wake up every day and just think, what\u2019s the phone call that\u2019s going to come today?\u201d The time in between, however, is very full. There\u2019s her family, her production company, and a driving curiosity that often sends her down a chain of reading and research and questioning.",

        "text": "The increase lifted his total net worth to $US383.2 billion. It\u2019s the biggest one-day increase ever recorded, and put him ahead of Musk for much of the day before the Tesla CEO edged back into pole position by $US1 billion. How did Ellison make his fortune on Oracle? Raised on the south side of Chicago after being adopted by his mother\u2019s aunt and uncle when he was nine months old, Ellison dropped out of both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago and moved to Berkeley, California, taking a computer programming job at Ampex, where he worked on a database called Oracle for the Central Intelligence Agency. Ellison has also benefited from a close relationship with US President Donald Trump. Credit: Bloomberg With two partners, Ellison founded in 1977 what eventually became Oracle. The company sold shares in an initial public offering on March 12, 1986, a day before Microsoft\u2019s IPO. He stepped down as Oracle\u2019s chief executive officer in September 2014, taking on the titles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nLoading Why is Oracle having a moment right now? Oracle has invested billions of dollars over the past few years to become a provider of cloud infrastructure, offering computing power and storage over the internet. The firm has benefited from the enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as start-ups and other AI firms seek more capacity. As of early September, Oracle\u2019s share price had tripled since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. It hit an all-time high after market close in New York on September 9, as Oracle provided an aggressive outlook for its cloud business that surprised Wall Street and galvanised hopes that the global build-out of AI infrastructure is accelerating. It was a win for a company that was already having a good year. In July, Oracle inked an unprecedented commitment with ChatGPT operator OpenAI for 4.5 gigawatts worth of data-centre capacity \u2013 enough energy to power millions of American homes. Oracle also counts companies such as Nvidia and ByteDance\u2019s TikTok as major cloud customers. Taken together, this shows how Oracle is emerging as a key provider of such computing capacity, competing with cloud leaders Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet\u2019s Google.\n\nEllison has also benefited from a close relationship with US President Donald Trump. Ellison has been a Trump supporter and Republican donor for years. Since Trump returned to office in January, he\u2019s rewarded Ellison by elevating Oracle on multiple occasions. Ellison also owns a stake in Tesla. Credit: Bloomberg Ellison and Oracle are part of a $US500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate that Trump first touted in January. Trump has expressed support for Oracle to acquire a partial stake in the US business of TikTok, which would give Oracle a share of one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products. Oracle\u2019s bid for the popular video app owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, which includes several other potential investors, has been endorsed by Trump, but hasn\u2019t been approved by the Chinese government. What other businesses does Ellison own? He\u2019s spent hundreds of millions of dollars on luxury real estate in the past decade, including properties in Malibu and Rancho Mirage in California; the Beechwood Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island; and an estate in the San Francisco Bay Area modelled on 16th century Japanese feudal architecture.\n\nEllison has been a major shareholder of Tesla and owned about 1.5 per cent of the company as of the carmaker\u2019s 2022 proxy statement. He stepped down from Tesla\u2019s board of directors in June that year, and his stake hasn\u2019t been disclosed in subsequent filings. He was also one of the largest outside backers of Musk\u2019s bid to purchase Twitter, which has since been renamed X. What are Ellison\u2019s interests outside of tech? The software mogul has a history of lavish living. In a 2002 email to the tech founder, an accountant suggested that Ellison \u201cbudget and plan\u201d because his spending habits were becoming difficult to sustain, according to a January 2006 San Francisco Chronicle article. Ellison finances his lifestyle using debt and the proceeds from Oracle stock sales and dividends, which have amounted to more than $US12 billion since 2003, according to an analysis of data compiled by Bloomberg. He\u2019s an avid sailor and partially financed the BMW Oracle Racing team, which won the America\u2019s Cup in February 2010. He sold his stake in Rising Sun, a 138-metre megayacht, to billionaire David Geffen later that year. Ellison\u2019s Oracle Team USA defended the America\u2019s Cup in October 2013, defeating a team from New Zealand. He signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, promising to give away at least 95 per cent of his wealth to charitable causes.\n\nLoading How has Ellison been involved in Hawaii? Ellison\u2019s love for Hawaii, which began in his childhood, led to his $US300 million purchase of 98 per cent of the island of Lanai in 2012. There, he\u2019s partnered with David Agus \u2013 a doctor who treated Ellison\u2019s late best friend, Steve Jobs \u2013 to create Sensei, a chain of luxury wellness resorts focused on longevity. His personal connections have brought high-profile visitors including Musk, Hollywood actor Tom Cruise and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the once-sleepy island. Ellison\u2019s supporters have said his investments have helped revitalise Lanai but there have been complaints that the island has become more hospitable to the super-rich while squeezing out families that have lived there for generations.

        "text": "He was the only one who crossed the boundaries of civility. Those boundaries are necessary to avoid unnecessary drama around the whole unusual interaction that occurs daily between athletes and everyone else in professional sport. No potential defence stacks up. Bailey Smith, Max Holmes and Gryan Miers. Credit: Getty Images Why did he choose to pick on a local photographer who has done her job well and without drama for 25 years? If he wanted privacy for the massage, get it done inside the rooms. Or head to Mars (Stadium).\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t possible and it was an issue, ask a media official or football manager whether the photographer could refrain from taking a photo at that point. If Smith was having a bad day, that\u2019s life. I can bet with certainty there were people within the stadium that day who had personal battles of their own. We all want Smith to feel well, given the mental health struggles he has shared. But having mental health issues doesn\u2019t mean anyone should get a pass for bad behaviour. That\u2019s a stereotype better left to history.\n\nSo it comes back to a basic question: why? It would be the same question you would ask a mate if he turned up at your party and abused one of your lifelong friends. If he or she then wondered why you were making such a fuss, then you wouldn\u2019t invite them back. Perhaps Smith just has a reality TV star\u2019s penchant for drama, and we are all being played. But Wynd, the News Corp photographer, was not being intrusive. She wasn\u2019t doorstopping, nor pointing her lens into a space thousands of cameras haven\u2019t been before.\n\nStill, Smith treated her like a paparazzi photographer, using demeaning language to show his disdain. It was, to use a word Jack Ginnivan deployed well when doorstopped in Adelaide, embarrassing. It\u2019s not as though media people wilt either. Wynd and others are used to the cut and thrust that comes with being in this business. But we all know when a line is crossed. It would be unfair to write that Geelong have let Smith get away with this sort of petulance. They are working hard to shift his behaviour in the right direction, as the Western Bulldogs did before them. Geelong are choosing to do so in the background rather than via a public dressing down or punitive measures. That\u2019s fine. I respect that strategy. But the Cats\u2019 brand, one they have been working hard to maintain, is taking a hit as a result.\n\nEveryone knows Smith\u2019s form on the field has people inside the club contorting themselves to explain his positive attributes, of which, it must be said, there are many. That is unfortunate because the players are among the finer groups in the competition, respected within the community and outside the club, a legacy built over 20 years at least. They continue to look after their mate and he could show some gratitude for that. The best way to do that is through his actions. Coach Chris Scott is in a tough position too, but his intent is to help Smith through rather than bow to the baying mob, who want Smith to pay publicly. It\u2019s a strength of Scott\u2019s and preferable to the punitive approach the AFL takes. However, he can no longer rate Smith\u2019s season a 10/10 because that well-meaning show of support doesn\u2019t pass the pub test \u2013 or any other test for that matter, although I respect his obligation to defend his player.\n\nLoading Smith won\u2019t be the first or the last with a dim view of the mainstream media, particularly as the world fragments. But if he\u2019s smart, he will learn how to deal with people inside a stadium a community built. Because when mainstream media are invited into GMHBA Stadium, they don\u2019t leave their phones or cameras in a basket at the front door. Right now, Smith\u2019s big-city attitudes aren\u2019t going down well. Geelong want to embrace him. For the most part, they have. They want to protect him from intrusion as he tries to enjoy the best the coast has to offer. He\u2019s helping them in the quest for a premiership and is a Brownlow chance.",
