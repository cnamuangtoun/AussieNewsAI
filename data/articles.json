(Supplied)\n\nCarroll left his 9-5 job at Commonwealth Bank to start his own business and isn't surprised voter sentiment would shift in favour of flexibility.\n\nHe quit CBA before it ordered workers to return to the office 50 per cent of the time and enjoyed a hybrid model while still working at the bank.\n\n\"Perceptions are changing in terms of what people want from their career,\" Caroll, who started his research company The Launch Crew after the COVID-19 pandemic, told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"People are realising that enjoyment of life doesn't just come from money, it comes from the social side of life\u2026 and you get more of that from flexibility at work.\"\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Rippling, 42 per cent of people would re-consider joining a company if it expected full-time office attendance.\n\nMore than half of those surveyed also said they rank family-oriented benefits such as flexible hours and parental leave above all else, including salary.\n\nCarroll said he'd also likely choose the benefits of regular work from home over more money if he was job hunting again.\n\n\"The quality of life would reduce a lot [without WFH],\" he said.\n\n\"You can save money with more flexibility, spending less out on lunch, if you have kids you don't necessarily need childcare or you don't need to pay hideous rent in Sydney, I could live somewhere else a bit cheaper,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Customer left confused after bank closes accounts with no warning or reason\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton walked back his plans to force federal workers back into the office. (James Brickwood)\n\nVice president and head\ufeff of Rippling Matt Loop said hybrid work can feel like an eight per cent salary boost when you combine savings on commutes, parking and lunches.\n\n\"For many households, ditching the train fare or after-school care is worth more than a modest bump in base pay,\" he explained, referencing an estimate made by the International Monetary Fund .\n\nCarroll described Dutton's earlier vow to ban working from home for public sector workers as a \"kick in the teeth\".\n\nAnd Loop anticipates this reneged policy will still loom large over the federal election as Australians head to the polls, despite Dutton walking it back and insisting it would never have impacted private-sector employees.\n\n\"The debate around flexibility now extends far beyond just the workplace. When an issue shapes everyday life so strongly, it can become a key factor that affects voting decisions \u2013 like healthcare or economic policy,\" Loop said.\n\n\"Tough talk on WFH from public figures might play well to those who equate employee presence with effort, but it completely ignores where the mainstream sits.\n\n\"Recent events show how quickly sentiment can shift when policies appear out of step with workforce realities.\"\n\nRippling vice president Matt Loop said Dutton's WFH stance looms large this election.

        "text": "The mother of a NSW woman who died of cervical cancer has told how her daughter spent more than a year trying to get doctors to listen to her concerns.\n\nAmanda Ne'Roi is speaking out about her daughter Jaime's devastating case as three peak research organisations - the Australian New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group, Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation - join forces to call on the government to commit $100 million in funding towards gynaecological cancer.\n\nAround 19 Australian women a day are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer, according to December 2024 statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).\n\nJaime Ne'Roi, pictured with her daughter Indiana. Jaime died in 2023 when Indiana was aged one. (Supplied)\n\nHowever, survival rates for gynaecological cancers have stagnated and fallen well behind improvements for other cancers, such as breast cancer.\n\nIn the 15 years between 1991\u20131995 and 2016\u20132020, the five-year survival rate for women with gynaecological cancers increased by just 6 per cent, compared with 13 per cent for breast cancer, the AIHW data shows.\n\nNe'Roi said Jaime knew something was not right a few months after she gave birth to her second child, Indiana, in May 2020.\n\n\"She was having spotting, discharge, and an upset stomach. She felt sick. She just knew something was wrong,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nJaime went to her GP, who referred her to a gynaecologist she had seen a decade earlier, when abnormal cells were detected on her cervix.\n\nAt the time, the gynaecologist decided against a hysterectomy because she was yet to have children.\n\nNe'Roi said the gynecologist dismissed her daughter's symptoms because she had recently given birth.\n\n\"He said it was just because she had a baby. He didn't even give her a pap smear test,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nIt took her daughter Jaime more than a year for doctors to listen to her concerns, her mother Amanda Ne'Roi said. (Supplied)\n\nJaime then went to another gynaecologist, who also attributed the symptoms to her having had a baby and put her on the contraceptive pill, Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"She kept saying to them, there's something very wrong.\"\n\nNe'Roi said she remembered having conversations with Jaime, who was very worried, and telling her to go back to the gynaecologist.\n\nAfter another visit, the gynaecologist agreed to do an internal examination via a laparoscopy in August 2021, which revealed Jaime had stage 3 cervical cancer at the age of 37.\n\n\"By the time she actually got a doctor to listen, she had a seven-centimetre tumour and it was inoperable,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nJaime underwent radiation and chemotherapy, and briefly received good news in December 2021, when a scan showed up clear.\n\nHowever, by February 2022 the cancer was back and had spread to her uterus and lymph nodes.\n\nA hysterectomy and more chemotherapy and radiation followed, but Jaime's health was deteriorating fast.\n\nThe last option presented by Jaime's doctors was immunotherapy, however, the family was told it would need to foot the bill at a cost of $6000 a fortnight.\n\n\"My husband and I were looking at selling up our property, everything - so were her brothers,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nWith the money needed immediately, however, the family started an online fundraiser, which allowed Jaime to start the treatment.\n\nThe treatment was not unsuccessful and Jaime died in July 2023, just under two years after she was first diagnosed.\n\nShe left behind her partner and two children, Harrison, then aged six, and Indiana, aged one.\n\n\"The hardest thing I've had to do in my whole entire life was to tell my grandson his mum had gone,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"He burst into tears and said, 'I just want my mommy back.'\"\n\nJaime Ne'Roi died two years after she was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer. (Supplied)\n\nRates of cervical cancer have been increasing in Australia, despite the national rollout of the HPV vaccine in 2007, which provides some protection against the cancer-causing virus.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2024, incidence rates of cervical cancer have climbed from 5.5 cases per 100,000 people to 8, AIHW data shows.\n\nNe'Roi said Jaime had been vaccinated for HPV, which showed why women should not become complacent about the disease.\n\n\"I think the trouble is, people become very complacent about gynecological cancers, they aren't mentioned much. Breast cancer is huge,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"I'm sharing this story to illustrate the hidden crisis impacting all Australian women, because it can hit any one of us at any time.\"\n\nMore money was desperately needed for research for all gynecological cancers, Ne'Roi said.\n\nProfessor Clare Scott, Australia New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) chair, said gynecological cancers had been left underfunded for decades and were a hidden crisis that was expected to grow.\n\nGynecological cancers - which include uterine, ovarian and cervical cancers - are predicted to surge by 21 per cent over the next 10 years.\n\n\"For too long, gynaecological cancers have been overlooked and underfunded, leaving women with limited treatment options and unacceptable survival rates,\" Scott said.\n\n\"These are not just statistics - they are our mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and friends... we must do better.\"\n\nANZGOG, along with Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation, are seeking $100 million in federal government funding over four years to go towards more personalised treatments for patients, clinical education, a national research databank and drug trials.\n\n\"The survival rates for gynaecological cancers have barely changed in decades. That fact alone should be a wake-up call,\" Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation CEO Robin Penty said.\n\n\"We know that the answers are there \u2013 they lie in research and in better understanding of women's bodies and women's pain. To reveal them we need appropriate and proportionate investment.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Health Minister Mark Butler said he would continue discussions with the ANZGOG about their proposal.\n\n\"The Albanese Labor government is doing all we can to support patients, families, loved ones and carers on the cancer journey,\" the spokesperson said.",

Geelong star Bailey Smith is waiting to see how much he will be fined for flipping off a fan in Adelaide after the Cats' win over the Crows.\n\nSmith has twice been fined for obscene hand gestures directed at opposition supporters this month and was also charged with misconduct for slamming a ball into Hawthorn player Jarman Impey's head.\n\nThe 24-year-old's individuality has been celebrated by Geelong, with coach Chris Scott among those railing against suggestions the Cats' boom acquisition should tone it down.\n\n\"That's his personality,\" Guthrie said.\n\n\"He's a very energetic guy and as long as his mind is still on task and he's playing the right way and helping the team, which he's been doing with his play out on the field, then I'm fine with it.\n\n\"Every individual's got a different way they go about it and that's his.\n\n\"But he's able to perform for us and that's the most important thing.\"\n\nSmith, who played 103 matches with the Bulldogs, spent the 2024 season on the sidelines with a knee injury before joining the Cats during last year's trade period.\n\nHe has formed a potent partnership with fellow Geelong dasher Max Holmes.\n\nIn five appearances with the Cats, Smith is averaging career-best numbers of 29.6 disposals, 11.6 contested possessions, 5.4 clearances and 5.2 tackles per match.\n\nGeelong's ability to walk the Bailey Smith tightrope could lead to premiership Photo shows Bailey Smith extends his arms In the heat of Geelong's epic battle with Hawthorn, a subtle interaction between Bailey Smith and a teammate gave an insight into how he has been able to slot into his new club so well.\n\n\"He's been huge.

(Supplied: Diversity Council Australia)\n\n\"Largely because they've had less opportunity to accumulate superannuation and savings due to interrupted or undervalued work histories,\" Ms Hunter said.\n\n\"Despite their capabilities, older women still participate in the workforce at much lower rates than men their age, largely due to the double impact of ageism and sexism.\"\n\nMs Hunter said while diversity in Australian workplaces had improved in recent years, including progress in age diversity, there was still work to be done.\n\n\"Research shows that age-diverse teams are more motivated, have higher retention and perform better,\" she said.\n\n\" Regional workplaces have a unique strength: deep ties to local communities. \"\n\nMs Lawlor has worked at McDonald's in Renmark since early 2021. (ABC Riverland: Elyse Armanini)\n\nLocal poster girl\n\nWhen she first started at McDonald's in 2021, Ms Lawlor wondered how she would be accepted by the predominantly young cohort.\n\nFour years on, the 64-year-old has become a respected member of the team with the moniker of Nanny.\n\n\"I love it. I've really engaged with the younger generation,\" she said\n\n\" They walk in and say, 'Morning Nanny!' and off we go. \"\n\nMaddii Lloyd, 25, (right) enjoys working with Ms Lawlor. (ABC Riverland: Elyse Armanini)\n\nWorking for the fast food giant in a regional town has taken Ms Lawlor to unexpected places, to her surprise and that of family members across the country.\n\nShe was filmed a couple of years ago as part of an advertising campaign shown during AFL games, and was included on flyers at the Perth show.\n\n\"Just goes to show, you don't have to be a 14-year-old and you can advertise the fact older generations are most welcome,\" Ms Lawlor said.\n\n'Underestimated' value\n\nMs Hunter said the value mature-aged women brought to industries such as hospitality was \"often underestimated\".\n\n\"[They] can offer strong interpersonal and communication skills that strengthen team cohesion and enhance customer experience,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement, McDonald's Australia said it provided jobs for people \"of all ages and experience levels\".\n\nAccording to data provided by McDonald's, more than 560 people aged over 60, nearly 1,000 aged over 55 and more than 2,000 45-plus are currently employed nationally out of a workforce of more than 115,000.\n\nRenmark McDonald's owner Brenton Edwards said while the company was one of the largest youth employers in Australia, hiring older workers at the local store had been beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nBrenton Edwards says the local McDonald's receives multiple applications a week from people aged 45-plus. (ABC Riverland: Elyse Armanini)\n\n\"We don't have 14 and 15-year-olds applying every day like some of the city stores do, so we've had to pivot a little bit and look at who we can employ,\" he said.\n\nMr Edwards said he was receiving on average two job applications a week from people aged 45-plus, and employees such as Jan brought \"maturity and a sense of calm\" to the environment.\n\nMs Lawlor says she enjoys making coffees and teaching younger employees barista skills. (ABC Riverland: Elyse Armanini)\n\nNot ready to hang up the apron\n\nWorking under the town's Golden Arches has become somewhat of a family affair for Ms Lawlor.\n\nHer daughter worked in the same restaurant during her school years in the late 1990s, and now her 16-year-old grandson, Noah, has joined the team at the same time.\n\nMs Lawlor said while she thought about retirement \"a lot\", she was happy staying in the workforce for a little while longer.\n\n\"You're helping others, but you're also helping yourself and you're broadening your horizons and your knowledge.\"",

(ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nWhen he began living on the block, his home was an old campervan with a pop-top roof, which was perfectly serviceable until Tropical Cyclone Yasi unleashed its fury on North Queensland in February 2011.\n\nThe Category 5 storm remains one of the most devastating to ever cross the Australian coast.\n\nAs Mr Parker sheltered in his van, he could hear trees and huge branches falling all around him as gale-force winds tore through the rainforest.\n\nDamaged boats are stacked on top of one another at Port Hinchinbrook boat harbour in Cardwell, Thursday, Feb. 3, 2011, as a result of category 5 tropical cyclone Yasi.

(ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\n\"The first little bird I saw was a little blue wren. It made my heart sing. I nearly cried because I thought if that little bird can survive then the cassowaries and all these other little animals, they're going to be alright,\" he said.\n\nThe house that Yasi built\n\nMr Parker never planned to build a permanent structure on his property.\n\n\"I wasn't going to build here because there was no way in the world I was going to cut these trees down. I wasn't even going to build a track,\" he said.\n\nBut with his campervan ruined, he decided to put all the fallen timber around him to good use.\n\nFriends whose properties had also been hit brought him extra wood, and with their help and the use of a portable mill, Mr Parker set to work using the timber to build the frames and trusses of a small house.\n\nMr Parker spends time repairing electronics at his kitchen table. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\n\"Two or three big blue gums came down so we cut them up,\" he said.\n\n\"It all came from here except the pine \u2026 I cut this [timber] really fresh within two or three weeks of it coming down and it cut dead straight \u2014 perfect,\" he said.\n\nIn just 16 days, Mr Parker had a small but liveable home. The kitchen and bathroom are still makeshift and the place is run on five deep-cycle batteries \u2014 recharged by the sun.\n\nMr Parker says one day cassowaries arrived at his property and now they visit him regularly. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nAdapting to life in the rainforest has come with its challenges.\n\n\"There is no water but there is a spring, so I invented a pump that pumps water up the hill and puts 5,000 litres of water in those tanks there a day,\" he said.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.\n\n\"[I love] the quiet at night.

So, he carved out a new life: helping other veterans.\n\n\"People say all veterans have PTSD, that is untrue. [Veterans] understand what their triggers are and can still be totally fantastic employees,\" he said.\n\nAccording to a 2022 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report, the unique nature of service can actually \"enhance a person's health and wellbeing\" \u2014 a phenomenon known as the \"healthy soldier\" effect.\n\nThe paper noted that in 2016, the majority of ex-serving ADF members surveyed were \"doing well\", with many having higher education qualifications, owning their homes and being \"socially connected by living in a family type household\".\n\nSeparate research by the AIHW did flag however that veterans have a higher suicide risk compared to the general population.\n\nThe NSW government's program aims to teach veterans how to find future employment outside of the military. (Supplied: Fire and Rescue NSW)\n\nAfter working closely in the employment sector, Mr Delaney recommended three simple things employers could do to help veterans in their transition.\n\nThis includes employers recognising the skills veterans can bring to an organisation, an option to identify as a veteran in job applications, as well as honest and constructive feedback for those unsuccessful in obtaining a position.\n\n\"We just want people to help veterans and do the right thing,\" Mr Delaney said.",

(ABC News: Alex Hyman)\n\n\"I don't want to go out of sheep and the boys don't want to go out of sheep,\" Mr Boyle said.\n\n\"We've got a lot of infrastructure, a lot of money tied up in fencing, 500km or more of fencing, five sets of sheep yards, three shearing sheds.\n\n\" It's all a lot of money tied up and \u2026 a lot of knowledge and wisdom tied up as well, and that's all going to go out the door. \"\n\nThe live export phase-out legislation, passed in parliament last year, came after a series of high-profile animal welfare incidents, including the deaths of thousands of sheep on the Awassi Express in 2017.\n\nSince 2017, the industry has made significant changes to animal welfare practices, and both the National and Liberal party have committed to repealing the legislation to end the live sheep trade.\n\nPeter Boyle hopes people in the city learn about why farmers want live exports. (ABC News: Alex Hyman)\n\nMr Boyle believes this is the industry's last chance to make their concerns known to city voters.\n\n\"We've only got one shot at this, and if we don't, it's our own fault,\" he said.\n\nAt the start of the election, a convoy of truckies and farmers made their way loudly at peak hour in Perth, appealing to their city cousins to support their protest.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe race for the seat of Bullwinkel is a three-way contest between the Nationals, Liberal and Labor and the hot favourite depends on where you live in the electorate.\n\nThe majority of Bullwinkel constituents live on the outskirts of Perth, and the concerns of those voters are more in line with people in the city.\n\nWannon, VIC\n\nChildcare and wind power are both driving debates in the seat of Wannon, in the south-west corner of Victoria.\n\nNamed after a local river, and a Liberal stronghold since 1955, current Wannon MP Dan Tehan is facing increased competition from surging Independent Alex Dyson.\n\nFor families, the region has become a childcare desert, with nearly three children vying for each childcare place on offer.\n\nLack of childcare is an issue on voters' minds in the seat of Wannon, as it is in much of Australia. (AAP)\n\nCourtney Finnegan lives in Port Fairy, has a three-year-old and is expecting twins.\n\nThere are more than 160 children on the wait list for the three childcare centres near Ms Finnegan, and in the main regional hub of Warrnambool, there are 350 children on the list.\n\nShe hopes there will be space for the twins by the time they are 12 months old, so she can return to her part-time administration job.\n\n\"My boss has asked if I'm definitely coming back to work and it really depends on the daycare situation,\" Ms Finnegan said.\n\n\"Needing two spots at once is a bit nerve-wracking.\"\n\nWind power is also a hot topic, as Wannon is home to the most wind farms of any electorate in Victoria.\n\nSteven Conte has always been in favour of renewables and has been waiting for action since the 1990s.\n\nHe lives in a micro home nestled in a picturesque town between Warrnambool and Port Fairy.\n\n\"If I had a choice, I would prefer to look out at an ocean-scape that didn't have any industrial kit in it,\" Mr Conte said.\n\n\"However, this is an extremely pressing clear and present danger.\"\n\nWind power is a hot topic in the seat of Wannon in Victoria. (ABC News: Charles Brice)\n\nFormer Warrnambool mayor Michael Neoh is the convener of a group opposing the offshore wind farm zone.\n\n\"We've got a pristine ocean, we've got a whale nursery, we've got tourist towns that also rely on the Southern Ocean,\" Mr Neoh said.\n\nHe believes the zone has become an election issue for voters because only one of the two key players running for the seat has made his position clear.\n\nIncumbent Liberal Party MP Dan Tehan has promised a Coalition government would scrap the zone, while Independent Alex Dyson has promised to hold his own consultation process and only support the project if there are real community benefits.\n\nLingiari, NT\n\nUnpaved and pot-holed, the red-dirt road out to the remote Indigenous community of Ltyentye Apurte/Santa Teresa, 80 kilometres south-east of Alice Springs, has been a source of frustration for decades.\n\n\"We've got our renals that travel on this road three times a week,\" said Arrernte man Darren Young.\n\nLocal kids ride bikes around Ltyentye Apurte/Santa Teresa.

One in three enrolled voters did not cast their ballot in the 2022 federal election.\n\nGilmore, NSW\n\nThe seat of Gilmore stretches 200km along the south coast of New South Wales.\n\nIt was the closest race in the country in the 2022 federal election, with Labor's Fiona Phillips holding onto the seat by just 373 votes.\n\nThis election will be a rematch between Ms Philipps and the Liberal hopeful Andrew Constance, with six other candidates in the mix.\n\nThe electorate's razor-thin margin is remarkable, and so too is its high rate of rental stress \u2014 the seventh-highest in the country.\n\nKristy Alleson has moved 13 times in three years amid the housing crisis on the NSW South Coast. (ABC News: Michael Black)\n\nNo-one feels this more than locals like Kristy Alleson, who has been squeezed out of the rental market and forced to move further south to find a place to live.\n\n\"I made my own timeline since my daughter was born \u2014 since August 2022, I've moved 13 times,\" she said.\n\n\"There were women's refuges, mouldy little asbestos homes, dodgy landlords that took a $4,000 bond and didn't want to give it back.\n\n\"I'm just looking at how many vulnerable situations I put myself in, just to try and have a roof over our heads.\"\n\nCoastal beach homes in the Shire of Eurobodalla lay vacant at a time of unprecedented demand for rentals.

We're really suffering,\" she said.\n\n\" Why has society turned such a blind eye to women and children? \"\n\nBoth major parties are offering policies to help first homebuyers. Labor has also committed to building more affordable housing if re-elected, and the Coalition will build support infrastructure in new suburbs.\n\nThe Greens, meanwhile, are appealing directly to renting Australians, with a national rent freeze and other housing policies.\n\nBut in an electorate as marginal as Gilmore, just a few hundred voters frustrated with the escalating housing crisis could swing this crucial seat.\n\nBraddon, TAS\n\nCovering the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, Braddon swings between Liberal and Labor at almost every election.\n\nIt includes some of the most regional and remote parts of the island state.\n\nKerrie Laffer is a long-time local in Zeehan, a mining town that was once the third-largest population centre in the state, but now has a population of around 700.\n\nZeehan is a small remote town that sits in the seat of Braddon on the west coast of Tasmania. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nMs Laffer said access to services like healthcare was a major problem in her community.\n\n\"We need more medical facilities \u2026 we need specialists that travel down, or transport for people that don't drive,\" she said.\n\nBraddon is often decided by which party is best catering to the industries and jobs in the area.\n\nWith the decline of some major mines and a shift towards FIFO and DIDO work, towns like Zeehan face a challenging future, with the industry they once relied on no longer able to sustain them entirely.\n\nOn top of changes in the mining industry, a debate is raging around salmon farming on the west-coast.\n\nMany locals feel there is no clear plan around what industries can replace these traditionally big employers.\n\nTassal's Aqua Spa well-boat servicing salmon pens off the Tasmanian coast.

He received repeat questions from individual reporters on his views on trans women, immigration numbers, public service cuts, and other tricky topics.\n\nToday, Dutton took a leaf from Albanese\u2019s playbook and said journalists would get one question each. He often ignored follow-ups by moving around the circle of assembled reporters to the next question. One or two follow-ups were acknowledged by Dutton, but it was an overall more controlled affair than earlier in the week.\n\nDutton will be relieved to have enforced such a rule without appearing overly domineering in telling a journalist they could not further question. The stricter approach is bad for transparency but a positive sign for the Dutton campaign heading into the final week \u2013 if it lasts.",

But even if they do, do those circumstances constitute Anasta having a conflict of interest? Hardly. That would assume someone in Anasta\u2019s position in the media lives in a soundproof room. Being prominent in the media isn\u2019t relevant to either test. Anasta has no more of a conflict of interest than does Peter V\u2019landys, by reason of him merely being Racing NSW CEO and Australian Rugby League Commission chairman. V\u2019landys has no such conflict; thoroughbred racing and rugby league are two plainly different sports. Moreover, Anasta isn\u2019t exactly Robinson Crusoe in terms of someone in the media having a side hustle. Phil Gould, for example, is an expert commentator for Channel Nine, publishers of this masthead, and general manager of football at the Bulldogs. And that\u2019s fine. Nevertheless, would it be advisable for Anasta to veer away from expressing views that obviously touch on the interests of his clients? Yes. And I speak with some authority. I\u2019ve practised as a lawyer, specialising in sports law, for over two decades. Among other roles, I\u2019m an arbitrator with the National Sports Tribunal, the chair of the Combat Sports Authority of NSW, a member of the Harness Racing NSW appeals panel, and a member of the ethics panel of the International Testing Agency, which manages anti-doping programs for the International Olympic Committee and over 45 international federations.\n\nNRL 360 host Braith Anasta. Credit: NRL Photos Also, I\u2019ve written this column for 12 years. There\u2019s so much I\u2019ll never be able to write about, as much as it would make for tremendous copy. By virtue of his media role, Anasta is compelled to have opinions; nobody\u2019s going to watch someone that everyone invariably agrees with. My role as a columnist gives me a mere fraction of the prominence of Anasta, and my professional obligations far exceed his because I\u2019m a lawyer, who is required to shoulder the ethical obligations that go hand in glove with all that. I routinely agonise about what I can say, and what I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve no idea whether Anasta is afflicted with such angst. He should be. But he still doesn\u2019t have a conflict of interest in the proper sense. The more pertinent matter for examination is the level of power that exists to regulate player agents in terms of their professional obligations and conflicts of interest. It\u2019s the system of regulating sports agents involved in rugby league, and in professional sport in general in Australia, which is where things run out of steam.\n\nThere are currently about 150 sports agents registered under the NRL\u2019s mandatory Accredited Agents Scheme, which entitles them to represent rugby league players in contract negotiations with clubs. There were 105 agents registered just five years ago. Each of the 17 clubs has an elite squad capped at 30 players. That\u2019s just over 500 potential clients already involved at the game\u2019s highest level. Of the cohort of registered agents, most have no top-level clients, or maybe one. Player agency is as speculative an enterprise as scurraging in the dirt for truffles. Agents vacuum up umpteen 16-year- olds with stars in their eyes in the knowledge that maybe one of the crop will, one day, generate a commission. At the other end of the spectrum to the agents struggling with few or no clients, there\u2019s a cabal of uber agents, including the invariably-in-the-headlines Isaac Moses, who have sequestered the market. In addition to the countless superstars and emerging players on his books, Moses oversees the affairs of not less than five of the 17 NRL head coaches. Think about it: it would be nearly impossible to get the best possible contractual terms for all of your clients in that scenario, where basically there\u2019s one single market: the National Rugby League.\n\nConjecture over whether Anasta has conflicting interests by reason of his media prominence and his nascent player agency business misses the bigger issue. The NRL does a poor job of regulating the agency profession, which in turn is largely not the NRL\u2019s fault. It\u2019s seriously arguable that the whole concept of a governing body licensing and regulating player agency constitutes an unreasonable restraint on the trade of those wanting to act as player agents, and it\u2019s also a breach of Australia\u2019s competition laws. That argument has never been assessed in the Australian courts; push too hard, and it could be. In 2021, the NRL\u2019s appeals panel confirmed Moses\u2019 deregistration as a player agent, consequent to rules breaches of apparent \u201cgreat seriousness\u201d. It wasn\u2019t his first offending \u2013 he also was banned for six months over a decade ago, arising from the Melbourne Storm salary cap affair. Yet in 2025, Moses operates like a puppeteer in rugby league. His last deregistration remained in force for less than two years. Somehow, that fact sits at odds with a finding that a professional person committed rules transgressions of \u201cgreat seriousness\u201d. The stint on rugby league\u2019s naughty step never adversely affected Moses\u2019 registration as a rugby union player agent, nor the ability of other agents within his business to carry on. Now, he\u2019s more influential than ever.\n\nPlayer agents provide quasi-legal, financial and accounting services in negotiations that are complex, and where tremendous amounts of the folding stuff and livelihoods are bargained. Loading Lawyers, accountants and financial advisers are heavily regulated by governments and professional regulatory bodies. In contrast, player agents in rugby league subscribe to a code of conduct that requires them to (a) not take improper advantage of their position; and (b) not intermingle their personal interests with their professional responsibilities. Agents, however, aren\u2019t restricted in terms of a maximum number of clients, the number of clients playing in the same positions, the number of players who they represent at any given club, or in terms of representing coaching staff and media types as well as players. But regardless of what the NRL\u2019s rules say, there\u2019s a toothlessness to their operation in practice, as is evidenced by Moses\u2019 own registration history. It\u2019s not wrong that professional sports regulate agents; it\u2019s fundamental. But it\u2019s only part of the solution.",

        "text": "Spotlight on Tigers\u2019 culture Told yers. Last week in this space, I opined that Tigers coach Benji Marshall\u2019s tightly scripted remarks about there being no bullying in his team vis a vis Lachie Galvin, was surely on legal advice that the club was totally exposed in the way they had treated the 19-year-old wunderkind: dropping him to reserve grade, not reining in players attacking him on social media, and putting out a press release that unleashed the hounds of hell on him to the point that he needed a security detail, #FFS! Lachlan Galvin playing NSW Cup for Western Suburbs Magpies. Credit: Max Mason-Hubers \u201cThe Tigers\u201d, I opined, \u201ccould find themselves a long way up metaphorical Legal Shit Creek without a paddle. For while the Tigers might be a football team, they\u2019re also an employer, owing a duty of care to their employees. And in February, the High Court of Australia handed down a groundbreaking decision in a matter of Elisha v Vision where it held that Elisha could recover damages for psychiatric injury arising from a breach of the employment contract by an employer.\u201d And so it proved, for this week, we found out, the Galvin camp has indeed sent a legal letter right up the Tigers\u2019 Khyber Pass, pointing out much of the above, and alleging both bullying and an unsafe workplace. Yes, Galvin is back in the starting side \u2013 again, I would not be surprised if that, too, was on legal advice \u2013 but the whole debilitating affair has a long way to play out.\n\nAnd we are not even to the most extraordinary part. That came on Wednesday, when Tigers CEO Shane Richardson was interviewed by the Daily Telegraph. When it came to the club\u2019s culture, he said, the Tigers were \u201coutstanding\u201d. No, really. Who remembers any other club, ever, where three senior members verbally attack another player on social media, and a younger member at that? I\u2019ll wait. If that is \u201coutstanding\u201d, Richo, what does \u201cseriously ordinary\u201d look like?\n\nBut tell us, please do, your take on the Tigers putting out the press release that you were told by the Galvin camp would be a disaster \u2013 telling the world, what Galvin\u2019s management had said quietly, that the young man wanted to move on at the end of his contract \u2013 but you released it anyway. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Richardson said, \u201cmy job is to make sure that the Wests Tigers are protected. And I believe what we did, I don\u2019t believe it could be done any other way.\u201d Lachie Galvin and coach Benji Marshall make eye contact at Tigers training. Credit: Renee Nowytarger Seriously? You HAD to point out that your brightest young star wanted to move on, and despite the fact that this resulted in a fortnight of shattering headlines and the young man needing a security detail, this was still a good idea? And \u201cprotected\u201d the Tigers? Yes, Richo insisted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come out this week, we popped the pimple, we\u2019ve moved on from it. I honestly believe that we couldn\u2019t have done any better.\u201d The \u201cpimple\u201d? What does a festering boil look like? \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it any better\u201d? Just what would things look like now if it had been handled badly?\n\nAs to your equal insistence that Galvin \u201chas never once said to us, not one time has he said to us, that Benji\u2019s not a good coach or can\u2019t coach,\u201d to my neophyte legal eyes, that only bolsters the young fellow\u2019s legal case. You say, Richo, he never said that. But we all know he was dropped to reserve grade and became, for that fortnight, the most hated figure in the game, attacked by his own team for \u201cdisrespecting the coach\u201d and vilified by a howling mob of social and traditional media, asserting he said EXACTLY that. But you say he never did. What are they going off, then? The only answer can be that very press release you were advised not to put out, but did anyway. Seriously, those quotes are simply gobsmacking. Blokes want to leave clubs all the time. It\u2019s no big deal. It happens. But this has become a huge and embarrassing deal for the Tigers, precisely because of the way MANAGEMENT handled it. You say, very carefully, Galvin is not at fault. Who does that leave then? Why I won\u2019t be watching SBW v Gallen Here is 42-year-old former AFL star Justin Koschitzke telling Channel Seven this week what it was like dealing with concussion throughout his career. He\u2019d been badly concussed many times, and things were starting to go foggy, but he felt obliged to keep going.\n\n\u201c[I kept thinking] it will pass ... and this will get better, because you\u2019re in an environment where you don\u2019t want to lose respect from your teammates, you don\u2019t want to give an inch, you want to be in your armour because someone else is taking your spot [in the team]. What I thought was \u2018manning up\u2019 was to come back and play that year, but if I had my time again, there\u2019s no way I would have played that year ... knowing what I know now.\u201d He regrets it, bitterly. \u201cMaybe knowing what I know now, I wouldn\u2019t have played ever again. I can honestly say that. Why would I put myself in a situation to keep getting hit and keep getting hit, knowing what I know and what I feel like as a 42-year-old? But back then your bulletproof, right? You think this is going to get better.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. Every concussion is brain damage, and he can now see clearly just how disastrous the whole thing was for him. In a proper system, the game would have stepped in, and given him the tap on the shoulder: that\u2019s enough now. Meanwhile, I see many people are excited by the prospect of 39-year-old Sonny Bill Williams and 43-year-old Paul Gallen \u2013 already with many concussions between them \u2013 soon getting in the ring and having a \u201csuper fight\u201d.\n\nI am not. Read the above, again, and tell me you think it is a sporting contest you can morally support.

It\u2019s a bit like shaking a bottle of ketchup \u2013 all of a sudden everything comes out and that was a bit the case today.\u201d Shades of Ogden Nash\u2019s poem, The Catsup Bottle: \u201cFirst a little, Then a lottle.\u201d\n\nPhil Gould won\u2019t bring Lachlan Galvin to the Bulldogs: \u201cWe are not involved in the Lachlan Galvin discussion and we won\u2019t be involved in the Lachlan Galvin discussion.\u201d Maybe. But with that promise and $5, I reckon I could get a cappuccino. Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff on their AFL team. Not sure he\u2019s spoken to a Carlton fan recently: \u201cThis has to work. It has to work for Tasmania, it has to work for the AFL, it has to work not just for the next five, 10 years, but I want to make sure that the Tassie team is here in 100 years and Tasmanians are proud of it, just like Blues supporters and Collingwood supporters are proud of their team.\u201d Nathan Cleary.

The secret of which appears to be drinking an inordinate amount of coffee. Santa\u2019s stunt double and me \u201cThis is the worst weather for walking with bears,\u201d says Mikael Suorra as we zigzag through bushy undergrowth in a forest of birch and pine trees. We\u2019re hiking into a blustery wind, which means that any bears in the vicinity are unlikely to smell us or hear us. This is a concern given Sweden\u2019s forests are home to around 2500 brown bears and we just passed a clearing that had been completely stripped of berries \u2013 presumably by a hungry bear. Not that Suorra is concerned. As the owner of Hide and See nature tours, he\u2019s spent years exploring these undulating woodlands near the village of Harads and has been mock-charged by both a bear and a two-metre-high moose. The secret with bears, he tells me, is not to play dead, but rather to shout and make yourself look as large as possible. And what happened with the moose? \u201cI just hid behind a tree.\u201d During our two-hour hike, he explains that the \u201cforest is always talking to you\u201d. Moss on a tree trunk grows on the northern side while the branches reach south towards the sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI learn how to clear blocked sinuses using formic acid emitted by ants (a skill I hope I never actually have to use) and the most effective way to collect their protein-rich eggs to fry up for dinner. After a lakeside \u201cfika\u201d (a cup of strong black coffee and a blueberry muffin made by his daughter), he demonstrates his most-prized skill: moose calling. Using a special conical loudhailer, he imitates the mournful cry of a cow in heat. \u201cYou can imagine how disappointed the bulls are when they turn up and find me,\u201d he says. In Sweden, the right to enjoy nature is enshrined in law. The right to enjoy nature is so precious to Swedes, it\u2019s enshrined in law. Called allemansratten, it\u2019s a public access prerogative that means you can hike, forage and camp almost anywhere, provided you\u2019re considerate and don\u2019t litter. That afternoon I join Robert Westin, owner of Arctic Adventure, for a kayak trip on the nearby Lule River \u2013 a broad, 450-kilometre-long waterway that starts in the far north of the country. After selling his IT security business in 2019, he now offers fishing, kayaking and snowmobiling tours. \u201cMy father was a professional trapper and hunter,\u201d he says, \u201cso I spent every weekend in the wilderness.\u201d After paddling across the 200-metre-wide river, we skirt an island dotted with blood-red summer cottages and come ashore in a sheltered backwater by a small wooden hut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanoeing Naturally, the first thing he does is light a fire to brew coffee. On an average day, he reckons he drinks at least 20 cups. \u201cIf you can\u2019t make coffee in Sweden,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cyou won\u2019t find a wife.\u201d Sitting in the warm, late-afternoon sun among a verdant landscape of fragrant pines, it\u2019s hard to believe this entire river freezes solid in winter, transforming into a frosty playground for snowmobilers and ice fishers. The coldest temperature Westin has experienced is a frankly unimaginable minus 52 degrees. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just need the right clothing.\u201d For the native Sami, who\u2019ve been living in the Arctic for more than 2000 years, the right clothing was primarily animal hides and fur. Like many indigenous groups, they survived in the extreme conditions by utilising the natural resources around them. The following day I meet Lars Eriksson, an 80-year-old Sami reindeer herder, at his property in the small hamlet of Flakaberg. With his snow-white beard, colourful wool gakti (a traditional tunic) and elaborately decorated leather belt, he could easily pass as Santa\u2019s stunt double. \u201cMy life is reindeer,\u201d he says, explaining that he would spend the summers tending his herd in the forest before moving them to the coast in winter. All the reindeer in Sweden belong to the Sami; a mark on each animal\u2019s ear uniquely identifies its owner. All the reindeer in Sweden belong to the Sami.

Now you\u2019d need 1000.\u201d He explains that climate change and excessive logging have made it harder for the reindeer to find lichen, their main food source, so herders have to supplement their diet with hay. Reindeer are unusual in that both males and females have antlers, which regrow every year. In an impressive feat of yogic dexterity, they shape them using their back legs, a process done by feel to ensure they grow symmetrically. When a reindeer is slaughtered, the Sami use everything, even down to the ligaments, which are dried and repurposed as thread. Having devoted his life to reindeer, Eriksson is now happy to be home with his wife and a small herd of 40 animals that live in the surrounding forest. \u201cI know every one of them,\u201d he says, fondly. \u201cThey all have different personalities.\u201d Running with the pack Training for winter \u2013 booties and a wheeled cart for the huskies.\n\nAdvertisement",

A narrator who seems to be a newcomer to Australia tries iconic dishes like a vanilla slice, pavlova, supermarket hot chook, Bubble O'Bill ice cream and a Bunnings 'sausage sizzle'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comment section is full of Australians praising the narrator's calm Korean commentary and sense of wonder at everyday foods, with fans offering recommendations for more classics, such as Arnott's Shapes and Milo.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter feedback about how they prepared a hot cross bun \"wrong\", Aus Foodiee thanked fans and gave it another go in a second video, where they were judged to have prepared it properly \u2014 toasted with lots of butter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat fans don't know is that the account is actually the work of two Korean men \u2014 Mingoo Lee and Jungho Choi.\n\n\n\nAbout Aussie life and going viral\n\nIn their first-ever interview \u2014 where they revealed their faces and names \u2014 the Aus Foodiee creators spoke to SBS News about how life in Australia has been a surprising treat since arriving two months ago on working holiday visas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people don't use shoes here. I don't know why,\" Lee said, laughing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The traditional Aussie has a hairstyle like yours.\" He pointed to this author's mullet and laughed even harder.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee, who worked as a videographer in Korea, is typically the one who directs, films and edits the videos.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he doesn't cook, leaving that job to Choi, who has worked as a chef in his day job for over seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason they don't show their faces is that the videos are easier to edit if there are no shots of people, they said, half-joking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair said they have been \"best friends for 20 years\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey met as eight-year-olds and have maintained a close friendship despite moving to separate cities \u2014 Lee lived in Seoul and Choi lived in Busan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a far cry from regional Victoria where they're living now, juggling foodie shoots in between work and travel to Melbourne to film at restaurants.\n\n\n\nLee said he created the account to help people understand and connect with other cultures, and said what he's learned along the way has helped him adapt to life in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't expect lots of people's interest, but I think I want to make a very helpful account. And I think food has a very special energy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't expect us to have an encouraging and powerful effect, but someday we are going to make this channel bigger and bigger and bigger.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is Indonesian the new Thai?

I think it's also called Bunnings sausage sizzle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How to make it is easier than you think.\"\n\n\n\nAs is often the case with their dishes, fans who frequently comment on their posts gave them another idea, so they filmed a trip to get a sausage in bread from Bunnings, describing it as \"meaningful food\".\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi and Lee said they weren't sure why so many people loved the sausage video in particular, but they thought the meal was one of the tastiest they've had.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duo laughed, saying they were surprised the sausages were so thin.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving also learned about it from the comments section, they will go to get a 'democracy sausage' on election day on 3 May .\n\n\n\nWhat are the duo's favourite dishes?\n\nSo what's Lee's favourite dish he discovered in two months in Australia?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kebab.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi's favourite is the hot cross bun, though he really enjoys Japanese food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said Australia's food scene should be described as multicultural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can try every country's food, but some are not as good as others,\" Lee said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the Korean food they tried in Melbourne was nice but not spicy enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duo plan to make as many videos as they can while in Australia, most likely whatever their audience suggests Choi should cook.\n\n\n\n",

It sounds like a breeze when you say it like that. Slip, Slop, Slap! In the sun this summer say 'Slip, Slop, Slap!' Slip, Slop, Slap!'\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1981, the famous Slip, Slop Slap campaign stormed our screens and airwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSid the Seagull was enlisted to encourage Aussies to seek protection from ultraviolet or U-V damage from the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n44 years on and the Cancer Councils of Australia and Bureau of Statistics have done a study that shows while the song still slaps.. it seems the message has slipped.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Anne Cust studies cancer in populations as an epidemiologist and Chair of the Cancer Council's National Skin Cancer Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One in five young Australians have tried to get a suntan in the past year and only about half of Australians are using adequate sun protection.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alarming trend comes as the rate of melanoma continues to rise - 16,800 Australians will likely be diagnosed this year - one every thirty minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration Z are educated on sun safety - so why aren't younger Australians following the rules?\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Stephen Dann - a marketing expert at the Australian National University - says social media is a big factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first thing is they are a young audience who are very driven by immediate outcomes. I get a tan, I look aesthetically pleasing to myself and the people around me. I look good. I feel great. I have a consequence coming to me in 35 years' time. That is future me's problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Australian of the Year, Professor Georgina Long, is the joint number one expert in the world in melanoma research.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is frustrated by the rules around what influencers in Australia can advertise online.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can't spruik products with an S-P-F rating including sunblock, but they can use their platforms to share information about non-therapeutic goods, like tan accelerants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, people put these creams on to go in the sun and get a more accelerated tan more quickly. That is dangerous, that is a carcinogen, that is cancer causing. Do we need legislation about that? Do we need to free up guidelines around advertising good sunscreens. At the moment, good sunscreens, we're not able to advertise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2022, the Therapeutic Goods Administration banned social media testimonials around products or devices that claim a medical or therapeutic benefit - including skincare and vitamins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rule can apply to any description of the qualities of a product with S-P-F protection, including sunblock.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Dann says the rules that were designed to protect consumers, may have had the opposite effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were more worried about food contamination, or someone being offered a miracle cure for something that wasn't curable. That sunscreen got swept up as a consequence was one of those unfortunate outcomes of good policy, bad implementation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs TikTok trends, including hashtag sunburnt tan lines gather hundreds of millions of views - the Cancer Council is fighting back with its End the Trend campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix high profile Australian social media influencers have spent the past month staying out of the sun, rejecting fake tan and guiding their followers to the shade.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline influencer Tayla Broad was motivated to end the trend, because she saw how skin cancer impacted loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can all be aware just how damaging the tanning culture can be, even with the likes of fake tanning. So, join me on this journey to challenge the way we view tanning and why we feel the need to tan to be beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Cust sees the irony in tanning trending in an online space dominated by beauty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"UV radiation that you get from the sun, there are different types of UV radiation. UVA is responsible for a lot of the ageing that we see from the sun exposure and the UVB is responsible for a lot of the burning. So, if you are concerned about beauty, it is much better to stay out of the sun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Long has pioneered and led research into immunotherapy treatments for melanoma that mean a diagnosis that was deadly in 2010, now has an above-fifty-fifty chance of a cure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a handshake that the cancer cell would give the immune system or the immune cells so that the immune cells would say 'this is my friend, this is my family, off I go, I won't kill you.' But these drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, interrupt that handshake and allow those immune T cells to kill the cancer cells, the melanoma cancer cells. So those drugs which we started working with around that 2010 period absolutely revolutionised how we later treated melanoma.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a monumental feat she and her colleagues have achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Professor Long is united with experts who agree prevention is the best cure - and the second line of defence is a skin check.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn online melanoma risk assessment tool is available at melanoma risk dot org dot a-u.\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied / NBC Her anti-perfectionist stance has made her something of a poster girl for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the reason I've made it quite far in my life for someone who came from nothing and didn't know anyone, had no connections, is because I have the audacity of a man,\" says Jamil.\n\n\n\nI have the audacity to know that it's not my responsibility to be perfect when I just start trying something for the first time.\n\n\"I don't know if I'm going to be good at it, but I throw myself in and I am proud of myself for that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an attitude that the 39-year-old credits with giving her a life that's a far cry from the \"dignified\" one she envisioned when she was younger.\n\n\n\nJamil grew up wanting to be a doctor. She says her younger self would probably think she's \"a massive goon\" and be \"very embarrassed\" by her. Source: Instagram / Jameela Jamil\n\nAn unconventional path to fame\n\nA chance encounter with a producer in a London pub in 2008 led Jamil, who was working as an English teacher, to land a job as a TV presenter.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe later moved into radio presenting, becoming the first female solo host of BBC Radio 1's Official Chart show, before upping sticks to Los Angeles to pursue screenwriting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was there, after securing her first-ever acting role in 2016 as British socialite Tahani Al-Jamil in the hit TV series The Good Place, that she found global fame.\n\n\n\nJameela Jamil (right) rose to prominence in the UK as a presenter on the youth entertainment show T4. Source: Getty / Ian West - PA Images But as her profile increased, so did her impulse to speak out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how to not say anything,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a choice whether or not you can say something when you see injustice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJamil's growing frustration with women's value being measured by a number on the scale led the self-described \"feminist-in-progress\" to found the I Weigh movement in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want something to change, if you complain about a problem, then surely it would only make sense, logically, to try and do something about it?\" she says of her advocacy efforts.\n\n\n\nAfter Jamil's post went viral, she turned it into social media movement. Source: Instagram / Jameela Jamil Beginning as a social media campaign encouraging people to publicly celebrate their achievements and contributions to society rather than focus on their size or appearance, I Weigh later evolved into a \"community allyship platform\". It was relaunched last year as Move For Your Mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jamil's unashamed outspokenness and advocacy have been praised by many and led to plaudits such as being named one of Time magazine's 25 most influential people in 2019, she cringes at being put on a pedestal or viewed as \"some type of guru or master\".\n\n\n\nIt's not a call to arms \u2026 I'm more trying to start big, public conversations about [these issues] so we can stop just being lulled into submission all of the time.\n\n\"It's normal to care. It's not normal to not care.\"\n\n\n\n'Pretty privilege' and pile-ons\n\nNaturally, there have been questions about whether a statuesque, conventionally attractive cisgender woman (Jamil's name literally means \"beautiful\" in Arabic) in Hollywood is qualified to speak about issues like diet culture and fatphobia, particularly when much of the associated harm is perpetuated by celebrities and influencers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJamil acknowledges she is more privileged than most. At the same time, she has experienced firsthand the long-term harm that comes with trying to meet unrealistic and ever-changing beauty standards, as well as how brutally women, particularly those in the public eye, can be treated for simply existing.\n\n\n\nEarly in her career, Jamil was subject to tabloid scrutiny in the UK, which criticised her for being too thin and then later mocked her for gaining weight as a result of medication she was taking.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, she was battling an eating disorder that had developed in her teens, something Jamil says has caused lasting damage to her bone density, digestive system, kidneys, liver, and heart.\n\n\n\nShe says part of the pull to conform to beauty standards stems from an underlying desire to belong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's this feeling of 'I'll be left behind if I don't obey the group and do the thing that will allow me to be included,' because it's real that if you are skinnier or you look younger or you have pretty privilege, you're more likely to be included.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as speaking publicly about the racism, classism and appearance-based abuse she experienced growing up \u2014 including being \"very violently\" bullied for being South Asian \u2014 Jamil has been vocal about the impact of multiple chronic health conditions she's experienced throughout her life, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, mercury poisoning and coeliac disease.\n\n\n\nHer propensity to be an \"open book\" about her life has sometimes come back to bite her. In 2020, a string of Instagram posts went viral, alleging Jamil had fabricated details about her injuries and illnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author of the posts even went so far as to suggest Jamil had Munchausen syndrome, a mental disorder in which a person fakes or exaggerates illness to gain attention and sympathy.\n\n\n\n\n\nJamil publicly refuted the claims, as did her long-term partner, musician James Blake, saying they highlighted how people with chronic health conditions and invisible disabilities are often disbelieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jamil has endured her fair share of trolling and abuse online, not all of the criticism levelled at her has been unjustified.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne such example is her past \"slut-shaming\" of other female celebrities, including Miley Cyrus, Beyonce, and Rihanna.\n\n\n\nJamil lives in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, English musician James Blake. Source: Getty / David Crotty/Patrick McMullan Jamil says she regrets some of the things she's said and how she's said them and takes accountability for that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But you can regret something and still be glad that you did it because that's how I learned what to do differently next time,\" she says of how she used to communicate online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I hadn't made those mistakes, I wouldn't have then gone on to go, 'Oh, okay, I actually need to change course', and this has made me a better and wiser person.\"\n\n\n\n'Perfection is the enemy of progress'\n\nIn fact, self-accountability has become a core tenet of Jamil's advocacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid the rise of far-right extremism around the world, infighting among the left, and some hard-won rights and freedoms, particularly for women, \"taking a huge backswing\", Jamil's belief that \"perfection is the enemy of progress\" is perhaps more vital than ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't really have time for everyone to wait to be the perfect feminist or the perfect activist,\" she says.\n\n\n\nYou just have to scrap in now before we end up in a bunch of red coats with white bonnets.\n\nJamil has waged a war against diet culture and beauty standards. Source: Instagram / Jameela Jamil/Stylist Magazine It's no surprise to Jamil that the recent sociopolitical regression, particularly in the US, has coincided with thinness being glamorised once again and the increasing normalisation of cosmetic procedures and weight loss injections , largely pedalled via social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nRather, she says, it's \"by design\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only reason any grown adult man would want a grown adult woman to look and behave and have the body of a barely pubescent girl is to keep her small in every way; make sure she's not eating enough so she's not got the strength to fight for her rights, make sure she's consumed and worried and panicking over every tiny 'imperfection' on her face so she's distracted, she doesn't have time to organise; make sure she's not sleeping enough, make sure she's got low self-esteem.\"\n\n\n\nJamil was named one of Glamour's magazine's women of the year in 2024. Source: Getty / Karwai Tang But Jamil says she's perplexed why, after so much positive progress around things like fat liberation, body positivity, feminism, and understanding the misogynistic roots of beauty standards, women are still willing to comply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's honestly creeped me out watching grown women in 2025 lap it up again as if we learned nothing in the last 10 years,\" she says while also emphasising she supports people's right to do what they want to their own bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind happened, and everyone's brains just got wiped of everything that we all collectively discussed, because we have Stockholm syndrome for the patriarchy \u2014 and we have to just own that.\"\n\n\n\n'We're all guilty of it'\n\nJamil, admittedly, isn't entirely immune to the pressure to conform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's no way I would wear the dresses I wear if I didn't live with a man that I wanted to sleep with. I would be wearing much more comfortable clothes, I wouldn't wash my hair, I don't think I'd brush my teeth,\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're all guilty of it \u2014 but to what extent are you willing to punish or risk your body, your life, and your mental and physical health for a patriarchal standard?\"\n\n\n\nThe beauty and diet industry will always make sure that you feel like a pig, no matter what you do.\n\nThe cyclical and, at times dangerous nature of beauty standards is largely why Jamil has sworn off undergoing cosmetic surgery and treatments, such as botox and fillers .\n\n\n\n\"I hated being young, I love being older, I don't want any memory of what life was like when I was too young to have any wrinkles,\" says Jamil Source: Getty / Marla Aufmuth Like imperfection, ageing naturally and entering her \"crone era\" is something she's actively embracing \u2014 and hopes to inspire others to do as well. ('Crone era' is a term used in some feminist circles to describe a phase marked by the wisdom of age.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want my 85-year-old self to like who I am now. I want her to feel like I was looking out for her, that I was excited for her arrival, and I wasn't dreading it, and doing everything I could to avoid it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to preserve youth forever \u2026 These wrinkles that I'm getting are ones that have been formed from me frowning and figuring out how f**ked the world is, and I'm glad for them. They're lines of wisdom.\"\n\n\n\nFinding humour in disaster\n\nWith so much heaviness in the world right now, Jamil's focusing her energy on injecting more humour into her work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everything's getting too dark. It's too dark. I can't take it anymore. I'm going to explode,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We all need a release.\"\n\n\n\nNext month, she's launching a new comedy podcast, Wrong Turns, which will feature \"some of the funniest people in the world\" sharing their \"best disaster stories\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every time you hear about something terrible or embarrassing happening to someone, there's always this need for us to turn it into an inspirational, teachable moment \u2026 [but] sometimes you don't get wiser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes things are just shit, and we need to accept that and laugh about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Evening with Jameela Jamil will take place at Sydney's State Theatre on 26 April, Brisbane's QPAC Concert Hall on 27 April, and Melbourne's Hamer Hall on 28 April.\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking support for body image concerns and eating disorders can contact Butterfly Foundation on 1800 33 4673.

        "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced this week that his work with the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will \"drop significantly\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a conference call with Tesla stakeholders, he vowed to only spend \"a day or two per week on government matters\" starting from May.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust before the announcement, Tesla shares closed nearly 4 per cent higher after experiencing their biggest one-day fall in four-and-a-half years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported that Tesla has been facing uncertainty from the Trump tariffs and \"shifting global trade policies\", adding that the company's vehicle revenue dropped by 20 per cent and net profit by 71 per cent in the first quarter this year \u2014 the time since United States President Donald Trump took office and Musk started working at DOGE.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Elon Musk to scale back at DOGE amid falling Tesla profits\n\nOver the same period, hundreds of protests against Tesla have been organised outside dealerships and on social media around the world. Dubbed the 'Tesla Takedown', the movement is urging people to stop buying Tesla products, sell off Tesla stock, and join the protests.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Tesla dealerships have also been vandalised, which Trump called \"domestic terrorism\" while vowing the perpetrators would \"go through hell\".\n\n\n\nWhat is DOGE, and how much has it saved?\n\nDespite its name, DOGE is not an official government department in the US administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advisory body was created by Trump during a barrage of executive orders he signed on 20 January, the day of his inauguration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral DOGE staff appear to be young people from technology backgrounds with limited government experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusk has been quoted as saying DOGE aimed to cut US$1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) from the federal budget in a bid to reduce government debt. This was partly to be achieved by \"mass headcount reductions across the federal bureaucracy\".\n\n\n\nLast month, over 200 \"Tesla Takedown\" protets took place around the globe. Source: SIPA USA, AP / Kirsty Wigglesworth However, earlier this month he told a US cabinet meeting that target had been drastically revised down to US$150 billion ($230 billion) for the financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date the DOGE website claims it has saved US taxpayers US$160 billion ($284 billion) through the mass government layoffs, pulling back funding from programs and shutting government agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the claimed savings have been disputed, and at times the group has published incorrect figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters found 20 instances where the staff and funding cuts led to purchasing bottlenecks and increased costs; paralysis in decision-making; longer public wait times; higher-paid civil servants filling in menial jobs, and a brain drain of scientific and technological talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"DOGE is not a serious exercise,\" said Jessica Riedl, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank that supports streamlining government. She estimates DOGE has only saved US$5 billion ($7.8 billion) to date, and believes it will end up costing more than it saves.\n\n\n\nThe examples span 14 government agencies and were described in Reuters interviews with three dozen federal workers, union representatives, and governance experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these accounts do not provide a comprehensive picture of DOGE's project to drastically cut the cost and size of the federal bureaucracy, Reuters reported they do reveal collateral damage resulting from the group's efforts to make the sprawling federal bureaucracy more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to questions about the impact of DOGE's cuts on government efficiency, White House spokesman Harrison Fields told Reuters in a statement that Musk's team \"has already modernised government technology, prevented fraud, streamlined processes, and identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers.\"\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for DOGE?\n\nWesley Widmaier, a US-born professor at Australian National University's Department of International Relations, believes it's likely many DOGE employees also worked at X (formerly Twitter), which Musk acquired in 2022. At the time, Musk fired a large number of its employees around the world, including CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWidmaier believes that the future of DOGE is tied to Musk and the various dimensions he brings to his role as its chief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just Elon Musk as a person, it's Elon Musk as an apparatus,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If he were to step back [from DOGE], the project he has embarked upon \u2014 whatever you think of it \u2014 would also dwindle down.\"\n\n\n\nFrom speaking at election rallies, to meetings in the Oval Office, Musk has been a fixture during Trump's second presidency. Source: EPA, AP / (1) Aaron Schwartz, (2) Sarah Yensel, (3) Chip Somodevilla, (5) Alex Brandon Under US law, Musk is classified as a \"special government employee\", which allows him to work a government job for 130 days each year, with the period due to reset in January of 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven his reduced workload, Widmaier said it isn't clear when exactly Musk's finish date will be.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when Trump initially signed the executive order setting up DOGE, he also set the deadline of 4 July 2026 as the end date for the department.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis day corresponds with the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to an X post in December 2024 that said DOGE would finish entirely on this date, Musk wrote: \"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one has been publicly tapped to replace Musk once he officially winds up his work, however one option would be for the group to take its orders from Russell Vought, who runs the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 a key agency that oversees government spending and regulations in the executive branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Davis, a longtime Musk employee at SpaceX who has taken on a prominent role at DOGE, could be another contender, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith additional reporting by Reuters\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Opposition leader Peter Dutton appears to have backtracked on a $3 billion tax break for electric vehicle (EV) buyers \u2014 just two days after indicating the Coalition would keep the incentive if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Dutton said a Coalition government would not repeal the fringe benefits tax (FBT) exemption for electric vehicles, a Labor policy introduced in 2022 that has grown in popularity and cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut by Wednesday evening, the Coalition issued a press release confirming it would axe the scheme and said it was an example of \"wasteful spending\".\n\n\n\nDuring a heated press conference in Hobart on Thursday, Dutton said he thought he was being asked about Labor's proposed vehicle emissions standards earlier that week, not the FBT exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton claimed that he never said he would keep Labor\u2019s EV tax break and that his response on Monday was about Labor\u2019s vehicle emissions standards, an entirely different policy, which the opposition has dubbed the \"ute tax\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Labor's current policy, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles do not attract fringe benefits tax if they fall under the luxury car tax threshold of $91,387 and are bought through a salary packaging program.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the scheme began three years ago, between 90,000 and 100,000 customers have taken advantage of the discount, according to the National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association (NALSPA).\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australians are buying EVs even if they can't charge the cars at home\n\nAutomotive groups warn of price increases\n\nAutomotive groups have said drivers in outer metropolitan suburbs could be hit hardest by the change, which would raise transport costs for some while the Coalition's promised cuts to fuel excise would lower costs for others driving petrol cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change would raise costs for Australians buying electric vehicles by thousands of dollars each year, NALSPA chief executive Rohan Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For an EV around the $45,000 mark, we estimate a worker would pay another $3,500 per year without the exemption to own and operate that car,\" Martin told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If it was a $60,000 EV, such as a [BYD] Sealion 7, then it would be about $4,700 more per annum without the exemption.\"\n\n\n\nRising costs would hit families in suburbs hardest, he said, as households with longer commutes, solar panels and off-street parking had proven most likely to use the tax exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's average, everyday working Australians living in outer metropolitan suburbs that are the main beneficiaries of this existing policy and are the main users of this policy,\" Martin added.\n\n\n\n'Extremely disappointed'\n\nBefore the backflip, the Electric Vehicle Council's chief executive Julie Delvecchio said the decision for both major parties to support the FBT exemption meant Australians could \"continue to access cost-of-living relief by shifting to cleaner, more affordable cars\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut on Wednesday evening, Delvecchio issued another statement: \"If the Coalition is indeed scrapping the FBT exemption, after the opposition leader just days ago indicated he didn\u2019t have any proposals to change it, then we are extremely disappointed and confused by this backflip.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the Coalition wants to make cars cheaper and driving cheaper during a cost-of-living crisis, it wouldn\u2019t be removing this discount for Australians.\"\n\n\n\nThe Australia Institute also criticised the move, as well as tax breaks on big \"dumb\" utes, which cause more pollution than other cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Basic economics says to tax things you want less of and subsidise things you want more of, yet Peter Dutton seems to want less electric vehicles and more American-style utes on our roads,\" said Richard Denniss, executive director of The Australia Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Coalition says it's scrapping the EV tax break \u2014 which it supported up until Monday \u2014 because people who buy electric vehicles can afford them. Surely the same should apply for big utes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Earlier this week, the Coalition said it would not back a Labor promise to cut university debt by 20 per cent if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the major parties have very little to offer students, with the exception of students who happen to run private childcare companies or fossil fuel projects,\" National Union of Students education officer James McVicar told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the rest of us, it's a few crumbs off the table.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, where do the major parties stand on students? Here's what they've promised.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition: No to HECS relief, yes to tradies\n\nThe Coalition says it won't back Labor's promise to write off a portion of student debt if it's re-elected, calling the HELP cut \"elitist\" and \"profoundly unfair\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Coalition released a statement saying it would not proceed with Labor's plan to cut 20 per cent from all student loans, which Labor says would save the average graduate about $5,520.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not fair that they [university students] should get thousands of dollars from taxpayers, but the young tradies who had to borrow to pay for their ute or their tools, or the uni students who diligently paid off their student debt, get nothing,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore broadly, the Coalition's policies on education focus primarily on tradespeople.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've promised to build 12 new technical colleges in areas with skill shortages and youth unemployment. This will allow senior high school students to enrol in school-based apprenticeships and traineeships while still earning a Year 12 certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've also promised to return the number of apprentices and trainees in training to over 400,000 and have vowed to provide small and medium businesses with $12,000 to support the wages of new apprentices.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition promises to build 12 new technical colleges across Australia\n\nInternational students are also in their sights, with plans to cap international student numbers to 240,000 \u2014 30,000 fewer than what Labor proposed last year. They say the move will help free up housing for young people.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities Australia, a peak body for the sector, has pushed back against the \"scapegoating\" of international students, warning the move would harm the economy and damage Australia's reputation as a study destination.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Caps on international students won't just be a headache for universities\n\nLabor promises to slash student debt, raise repayment threshold\n\nLabor's pitch towards students has focused on its promise to wipe 20 per cent of student debt if re-elected, which they say will save about $5,520 for the average graduate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy, which would cost about $16 billion, would apply to around three million Australians. The government says it's aimed at relieving cost of living pressures on young people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government has also pledged to lift the income threshold for student loan repayments from $54,000 to $67,000.\n\n\n\nIf re-elected, Labor has promised to introduce a $10,000 incentive payment for Australians in construction apprenticeships and to fast-track the qualifications of 6,000 tradies to help build more homes across Australia, as part of its 'Advanced Entry Trades Training program'.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor will also make free TAFE permanent, and provide a payment to support nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work students to complete their unpaid prac requirements.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor floats plan targeting Morrison-era policy that hiked university course fees\n\nLast year, Labor criticised the controversial Job-Ready Graduates scheme, brought in under a previous Coalition government which hiked fees for arts degrees and lowered them for subjects like teaching and STEM.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare said in November he intended to set up an Australian Tertiary Education Commission to provide non-binding advice on university course fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Labor is yet to announce plans to reform the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Jobs-Ready Graduate scheme was and is a Liberal Party scheme to make students pay more for their education overall and channel them into degrees that they considered to be priorities,\" McVicar said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think the priorities of the party of Peter Dutton should dictate what's on offer to students in the higher education sector. I'm for a fully-funded and free higher education system without 'price signals' and soaring student debt.\"\n\n\n\nGreens pledge free university and TAFE\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian Greens have pledged to make university and TAFE free for students , with the government covering all fees for students studying at public universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey estimate this would cost $46.5 billion, which would be paid for by taxing big corporations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also want all university debt abolished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think at a bare minimum, we should have free education again,\" McVicar said. \"It could be easily covered with the money the government instead wants to spend on nuclear-fuelled submarines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

He received repeat questions from individual reporters on his views on trans women, immigration numbers, public service cuts, and other tricky topics.\n\nToday, Dutton took a leaf from Albanese\u2019s playbook and said journalists would get one question each. He often ignored follow-ups by moving around the circle of assembled reporters to the next question. One or two follow-ups were acknowledged by Dutton, but it was an overall more controlled affair than earlier in the week.\n\nDutton will be relieved to have enforced such a rule without appearing overly domineering in telling a journalist they could not further question. The stricter approach is bad for transparency but a positive sign for the Dutton campaign heading into the final week \u2013 if it lasts.",

        "text": "I don\u2019t watch much of Anasta\u2019s to-camera stuff, and I\u2019ve no view whether his opinions favour his clients\u2019 interests or not. But even if they do, do those circumstances constitute Anasta having a conflict of interest? Hardly. That would assume someone in Anasta\u2019s position in the media lives in a soundproof room. Being prominent in the media isn\u2019t relevant to either test. Anasta has no more of a conflict of interest than does Peter V\u2019landys, by reason of him merely being Racing NSW CEO and Australian Rugby League Commission chairman. V\u2019landys has no such conflict; thoroughbred racing and rugby league are two plainly different sports. Moreover, Anasta isn\u2019t exactly Robinson Crusoe in terms of someone in the media having a side hustle. Phil Gould, for example, is an expert commentator for Channel Nine, publishers of this masthead, and general manager of football at the Bulldogs. And that\u2019s fine. Nevertheless, would it be advisable for Anasta to veer away from expressing views that obviously touch on the interests of his clients? Yes. And I speak with some authority. I\u2019ve practised as a lawyer, specialising in sports law, for over two decades. Among other roles, I\u2019m an arbitrator with the National Sports Tribunal, the chair of the Combat Sports Authority of NSW, a member of the Harness Racing NSW appeals panel, and a member of the ethics panel of the International Testing Agency, which manages anti-doping programs for the International Olympic Committee and over 45 international federations.\n\nNRL 360 host Braith Anasta. Credit: NRL Photos Also, I\u2019ve written this column for 12 years. There\u2019s so much I\u2019ll never be able to write about, as much as it would make for tremendous copy. By virtue of his media role, Anasta is compelled to have opinions; nobody\u2019s going to watch someone that everyone invariably agrees with. My role as a columnist gives me a mere fraction of the prominence of Anasta, and my professional obligations far exceed his because I\u2019m a lawyer, who is required to shoulder the ethical obligations that go hand in glove with all that. I routinely agonise about what I can say, and what I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve no idea whether Anasta is afflicted with such angst. He should be. But he still doesn\u2019t have a conflict of interest in the proper sense. The more pertinent matter for examination is the level of power that exists to regulate player agents in terms of their professional obligations and conflicts of interest. It\u2019s the system of regulating sports agents involved in rugby league, and in professional sport in general in Australia, which is where things run out of steam.\n\nThere are currently about 150 sports agents registered under the NRL\u2019s mandatory Accredited Agents Scheme, which entitles them to represent rugby league players in contract negotiations with clubs. There were 105 agents registered just five years ago. Each of the 17 clubs has an elite squad capped at 30 players. That\u2019s just over 500 potential clients already involved at the game\u2019s highest level. Of the cohort of registered agents, most have no top-level clients, or maybe one. Player agency is as speculative an enterprise as scurraging in the dirt for truffles. Agents vacuum up umpteen 16-year- olds with stars in their eyes in the knowledge that maybe one of the crop will, one day, generate a commission. At the other end of the spectrum to the agents struggling with few or no clients, there\u2019s a cabal of uber agents, including the invariably-in-the-headlines Isaac Moses, who have sequestered the market. In addition to the countless superstars and emerging players on his books, Moses oversees the affairs of not less than five of the 17 NRL head coaches. Think about it: it would be nearly impossible to get the best possible contractual terms for all of your clients in that scenario, where basically there\u2019s one single market: the National Rugby League.\n\nConjecture over whether Anasta has conflicting interests by reason of his media prominence and his nascent player agency business misses the bigger issue. The NRL does a poor job of regulating the agency profession, which in turn is largely not the NRL\u2019s fault. It\u2019s seriously arguable that the whole concept of a governing body licensing and regulating player agency constitutes an unreasonable restraint on the trade of those wanting to act as player agents, and it\u2019s also a breach of Australia\u2019s competition laws. That argument has never been assessed in the Australian courts; push too hard, and it could be. In 2021, the NRL\u2019s appeals panel confirmed Moses\u2019 deregistration as a player agent, consequent to rules breaches of apparent \u201cgreat seriousness\u201d. It wasn\u2019t his first offending \u2013 he also was banned for six months over a decade ago, arising from the Melbourne Storm salary cap affair. Yet in 2025, Moses operates like a puppeteer in rugby league. His last deregistration remained in force for less than two years. Somehow, that fact sits at odds with a finding that a professional person committed rules transgressions of \u201cgreat seriousness\u201d. The stint on rugby league\u2019s naughty step never adversely affected Moses\u2019 registration as a rugby union player agent, nor the ability of other agents within his business to carry on. Now, he\u2019s more influential than ever.\n\nPlayer agents provide quasi-legal, financial and accounting services in negotiations that are complex, and where tremendous amounts of the folding stuff and livelihoods are bargained. Loading Lawyers, accountants and financial advisers are heavily regulated by governments and professional regulatory bodies. In contrast, player agents in rugby league subscribe to a code of conduct that requires them to (a) not take improper advantage of their position; and (b) not intermingle their personal interests with their professional responsibilities. Agents, however, aren\u2019t restricted in terms of a maximum number of clients, the number of clients playing in the same positions, the number of players who they represent at any given club, or in terms of representing coaching staff and media types as well as players. But regardless of what the NRL\u2019s rules say, there\u2019s a toothlessness to their operation in practice, as is evidenced by Moses\u2019 own registration history. It\u2019s not wrong that professional sports regulate agents; it\u2019s fundamental. But it\u2019s only part of the solution.",

        "text": "Spotlight on Tigers\u2019 culture Told yers. Last week in this space, I opined that Tigers coach Benji Marshall\u2019s tightly scripted remarks about there being no bullying in his team vis a vis Lachie Galvin, was surely on legal advice that the club was totally exposed in the way they had treated the 19-year-old wunderkind: dropping him to reserve grade, not reining in players attacking him on social media, and putting out a press release that unleashed the hounds of hell on him to the point that he needed a security detail, #FFS! Lachlan Galvin playing NSW Cup for Western Suburbs Magpies. Credit: Max Mason-Hubers \u201cThe Tigers\u201d, I opined, \u201ccould find themselves a long way up metaphorical Legal Shit Creek without a paddle. For while the Tigers might be a football team, they\u2019re also an employer, owing a duty of care to their employees. And in February, the High Court of Australia handed down a groundbreaking decision in a matter of Elisha v Vision where it held that Elisha could recover damages for psychiatric injury arising from a breach of the employment contract by an employer.\u201d And so it proved, for this week, we found out, the Galvin camp has indeed sent a legal letter right up the Tigers\u2019 Khyber Pass, pointing out much of the above, and alleging both bullying and an unsafe workplace. Yes, Galvin is back in the starting side \u2013 again, I would not be surprised if that, too, was on legal advice \u2013 but the whole debilitating affair has a long way to play out.\n\nAnd we are not even to the most extraordinary part. That came on Wednesday, when Tigers CEO Shane Richardson was interviewed by the Daily Telegraph. When it came to the club\u2019s culture, he said, the Tigers were \u201coutstanding\u201d. No, really. Who remembers any other club, ever, where three senior members verbally attack another player on social media, and a younger member at that? I\u2019ll wait. If that is \u201coutstanding\u201d, Richo, what does \u201cseriously ordinary\u201d look like?\n\nBut tell us, please do, your take on the Tigers putting out the press release that you were told by the Galvin camp would be a disaster \u2013 telling the world, what Galvin\u2019s management had said quietly, that the young man wanted to move on at the end of his contract \u2013 but you released it anyway. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Richardson said, \u201cmy job is to make sure that the Wests Tigers are protected. And I believe what we did, I don\u2019t believe it could be done any other way.\u201d Lachie Galvin and coach Benji Marshall make eye contact at Tigers training. Credit: Renee Nowytarger Seriously? You HAD to point out that your brightest young star wanted to move on, and despite the fact that this resulted in a fortnight of shattering headlines and the young man needing a security detail, this was still a good idea? And \u201cprotected\u201d the Tigers? Yes, Richo insisted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come out this week, we popped the pimple, we\u2019ve moved on from it. I honestly believe that we couldn\u2019t have done any better.\u201d The \u201cpimple\u201d? What does a festering boil look like? \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it any better\u201d? Just what would things look like now if it had been handled badly?\n\nAs to your equal insistence that Galvin \u201chas never once said to us, not one time has he said to us, that Benji\u2019s not a good coach or can\u2019t coach,\u201d to my neophyte legal eyes, that only bolsters the young fellow\u2019s legal case. You say, Richo, he never said that. But we all know he was dropped to reserve grade and became, for that fortnight, the most hated figure in the game, attacked by his own team for \u201cdisrespecting the coach\u201d and vilified by a howling mob of social and traditional media, asserting he said EXACTLY that. But you say he never did. What are they going off, then? The only answer can be that very press release you were advised not to put out, but did anyway. Seriously, those quotes are simply gobsmacking. Blokes want to leave clubs all the time. It\u2019s no big deal. It happens. But this has become a huge and embarrassing deal for the Tigers, precisely because of the way MANAGEMENT handled it. You say, very carefully, Galvin is not at fault. Who does that leave then? Why I won\u2019t be watching SBW v Gallen Here is 42-year-old former AFL star Justin Koschitzke telling Channel Seven this week what it was like dealing with concussion throughout his career. He\u2019d been badly concussed many times, and things were starting to go foggy, but he felt obliged to keep going.\n\n\u201c[I kept thinking] it will pass ... and this will get better, because you\u2019re in an environment where you don\u2019t want to lose respect from your teammates, you don\u2019t want to give an inch, you want to be in your armour because someone else is taking your spot [in the team]. What I thought was \u2018manning up\u2019 was to come back and play that year, but if I had my time again, there\u2019s no way I would have played that year ... knowing what I know now.\u201d He regrets it, bitterly. \u201cMaybe knowing what I know now, I wouldn\u2019t have played ever again. I can honestly say that. Why would I put myself in a situation to keep getting hit and keep getting hit, knowing what I know and what I feel like as a 42-year-old? But back then your bulletproof, right? You think this is going to get better.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. Every concussion is brain damage, and he can now see clearly just how disastrous the whole thing was for him. In a proper system, the game would have stepped in, and given him the tap on the shoulder: that\u2019s enough now. Meanwhile, I see many people are excited by the prospect of 39-year-old Sonny Bill Williams and 43-year-old Paul Gallen \u2013 already with many concussions between them \u2013 soon getting in the ring and having a \u201csuper fight\u201d.\n\nI am not. Read the above, again, and tell me you think it is a sporting contest you can morally support. What they said Billy Moore on the Bears coming back: \u201cWith my lovely wife, I\u2019ve had a glass of champagne already today. This is the biggest day since 1922 ... I\u2019m pretty f---ing happy.\u201d Carlos Alcaraz: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be called Rafa\u2019s successor. I want to be called Carlos Alcaraz Garfia.\u201d We will bear that in mind, Carlos Alcaraz Garfia.

For most people, the far north of Scandinavia is synonymous with Christmas \u2013 a twinkling, wintry wonderland of snow-smothered forests and rosy-cheeked good cheer. Visit during winter and you\u2019ll certainly find a version of that. But you\u2019ll also encounter temperatures that regularly plummet below minus 30 degrees and days where the sun never peeks above the horizon. While every season in Lapland has its appeal, there\u2019s a special allure to what the indigenous Sami people call \u201ctjaktjagiesse\u201d \u2013 the transition from summer to autumn that starts in August. It\u2019s a period characterised by crisp mornings, warm sunny days and a colourful fanfare of autumn foliage. It\u2019s the ideal time to venture outdoors \u2013 to fish, hike, bike and forage \u2013 and the lengthening nights offer the potential of glimpsing the fabled northern lights. Although Lapland officially includes the northernmost parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula in Russia, the region one hour north of Lulea (pronounced Loo-lay-oh) in Sweden is particularly compelling.

The secret of which appears to be drinking an inordinate amount of coffee. Santa\u2019s stunt double and me \u201cThis is the worst weather for walking with bears,\u201d says Mikael Suorra as we zigzag through bushy undergrowth in a forest of birch and pine trees. We\u2019re hiking into a blustery wind, which means that any bears in the vicinity are unlikely to smell us or hear us. This is a concern given Sweden\u2019s forests are home to around 2500 brown bears and we just passed a clearing that had been completely stripped of berries \u2013 presumably by a hungry bear. Not that Suorra is concerned. As the owner of Hide and See nature tours, he\u2019s spent years exploring these undulating woodlands near the village of Harads and has been mock-charged by both a bear and a two-metre-high moose. The secret with bears, he tells me, is not to play dead, but rather to shout and make yourself look as large as possible. And what happened with the moose? \u201cI just hid behind a tree.\u201d During our two-hour hike, he explains that the \u201cforest is always talking to you\u201d. Moss on a tree trunk grows on the northern side while the branches reach south towards the sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI learn how to clear blocked sinuses using formic acid emitted by ants (a skill I hope I never actually have to use) and the most effective way to collect their protein-rich eggs to fry up for dinner. After a lakeside \u201cfika\u201d (a cup of strong black coffee and a blueberry muffin made by his daughter), he demonstrates his most-prized skill: moose calling. Using a special conical loudhailer, he imitates the mournful cry of a cow in heat. \u201cYou can imagine how disappointed the bulls are when they turn up and find me,\u201d he says. In Sweden, the right to enjoy nature is enshrined in law. The right to enjoy nature is so precious to Swedes, it\u2019s enshrined in law. Called allemansratten, it\u2019s a public access prerogative that means you can hike, forage and camp almost anywhere, provided you\u2019re considerate and don\u2019t litter. That afternoon I join Robert Westin, owner of Arctic Adventure, for a kayak trip on the nearby Lule River \u2013 a broad, 450-kilometre-long waterway that starts in the far north of the country. After selling his IT security business in 2019, he now offers fishing, kayaking and snowmobiling tours. \u201cMy father was a professional trapper and hunter,\u201d he says, \u201cso I spent every weekend in the wilderness.\u201d After paddling across the 200-metre-wide river, we skirt an island dotted with blood-red summer cottages and come ashore in a sheltered backwater by a small wooden hut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanoeing Naturally, the first thing he does is light a fire to brew coffee. On an average day, he reckons he drinks at least 20 cups. \u201cIf you can\u2019t make coffee in Sweden,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cyou won\u2019t find a wife.\u201d Sitting in the warm, late-afternoon sun among a verdant landscape of fragrant pines, it\u2019s hard to believe this entire river freezes solid in winter, transforming into a frosty playground for snowmobilers and ice fishers. The coldest temperature Westin has experienced is a frankly unimaginable minus 52 degrees. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just need the right clothing.\u201d For the native Sami, who\u2019ve been living in the Arctic for more than 2000 years, the right clothing was primarily animal hides and fur. Like many indigenous groups, they survived in the extreme conditions by utilising the natural resources around them. The following day I meet Lars Eriksson, an 80-year-old Sami reindeer herder, at his property in the small hamlet of Flakaberg. With his snow-white beard, colourful wool gakti (a traditional tunic) and elaborately decorated leather belt, he could easily pass as Santa\u2019s stunt double. \u201cMy life is reindeer,\u201d he says, explaining that he would spend the summers tending his herd in the forest before moving them to the coast in winter. All the reindeer in Sweden belong to the Sami; a mark on each animal\u2019s ear uniquely identifies its owner. All the reindeer in Sweden belong to the Sami. Credit: iStock\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving sold most of his herd, he now dwells in the same wooden house with no electricity where five generations of his ancestors lived. \u201cEverything has changed,\u201d he says, wistfully. \u201cYou used to be able to survive on 400 reindeer. Now you\u2019d need 1000.\u201d He explains that climate change and excessive logging have made it harder for the reindeer to find lichen, their main food source, so herders have to supplement their diet with hay. Reindeer are unusual in that both males and females have antlers, which regrow every year. In an impressive feat of yogic dexterity, they shape them using their back legs, a process done by feel to ensure they grow symmetrically. When a reindeer is slaughtered, the Sami use everything, even down to the ligaments, which are dried and repurposed as thread. Having devoted his life to reindeer, Eriksson is now happy to be home with his wife and a small herd of 40 animals that live in the surrounding forest. \u201cI know every one of them,\u201d he says, fondly. \u201cThey all have different personalities.\u201d Running with the pack Training for winter \u2013 booties and a wheeled cart for the huskies.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Camping grounds in NSW have seen visitation grow by 49 per cent over the past decade. And now things are set to change.\n\nWith expected changes, some camping grounds will soon cost nearly $100 per night. Source: Getty\n\nAussies in the country's most populous state are being encouraged to have their say as NSW plans to dramatically overhaul the cost and booking systems for camping grounds in national parks. The expected changes will see travellers and avid campers pay more for most sites in the state but authorities say it is much needed to handle the increased popularity of domestic tourism and improve service delivery.\n\nThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is currently inviting the community to provide feedback on the vast proposal, which is designed to tackle issues including ghost camping and address a currently complex and inconsistent system of fees between sites.\n\n\"All feedback on the proposal, which aims to introduce more consistent and simplified state-wide camping fees and bookings for NSW national parks and reserves will be carefully considered,\" a spokesperson told Yahoo News.\n\nThe Service manages 895 parks and reserves which make up roughly 10 per cent of the state's total land mass. According to the consultation paper, visitation has grown 49 per cent over the last decade, and there are now more than 50 million visits to national parks every year, including 1.8 million overnight campground stays.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRELATED: Excitement as new NSW hike opens, but some balk at the cost\n\nThere have been no significant changes to New South Wales national park camping fees since 2017, however when the changes are enacted, fees will be pegged to increases in the consumer price index, meaning prices would rise each year.\n\nSeasonal price variations will also be applied, meaning campers will pay more in peak times but less on average during the off season.\n\nOverall, sites will be divided into tiers with the lowest tier amounting to a simple clearing with no facilities remaining free. Campgrounds from tier 2 to tier 5 (which make up 85 per cent of sites) will range from $22 in high season for the most basic campground to $65 for sites that have water and access to a flushable toilet. The top campsites, tier 6, which have hot showers and BBQ facilities, will cost $89 per night.\n\nWith CPI indexation, top camping facilities will soon cost more than $90 per night for group bookings. Source: NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service\n\nWhile Parks authorities aim to simplify things by potentially scrapping surcharges for extra people in group bookings, popular campgrounds, particularly around Sydney, will become materially more expensive to stay at during popular times.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor example, a family of four who currently pay $68 in a tier 6 beachfront campsite, would soon pay $89 per night, meaning a five night stay would cost an extra $105.\n\nThe higher costs are needed due to record investment in campground infrastructure, increased park management costs and changing community expectations, the National Parks and Wildlife Service says.\n\nThe numbers within the circles represent the number of campgrounds in that geographical area. Source: NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service\n\nMore generous cancellation refunds to tackle ghost camping\n\nVictoria has currently made camping in the state completely free. However NSW authorities have raised \"growing concerns\" around the problem of ghost camping where people book a campsite but then fail to actually turn up. To counteract this ongoing issue, the fee overhaul will increase cancellation refunds to 80 per cent. Currently campers who cancel less than a week out can't get a refund on anything, while they are only eligible for a 50 per cent refund if they cancel between eight and 30 days prior to their trip.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the changes appear all but certain, authorities insist ongoing feedback from the public \u2013 which closes in exactly one month \u2013 will inform the final details of the fee overhaul. You can have your say here.\n\nYahoo understands there is no concrete date for when the implementation of the new prices will commence.\n\nIt comes as councils across the country, as well as wildlife rangers, are cracking down on illegal camping. One council on the NSW Central Coast this month warned those in the area ahead of the Easter weekend of heavy fines for illegal camping, including a whopping $110,000 potential penalty for repeat offenders.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Source: Keith \u2018Harry\u2019 Hodges/Facebook/Getty\n\nAussie drivers have been urged to pay attention to a little-known marker that is \u201cappearing more and more\u201d on major roads. In NSW and Queensland, motorists have likely noticed green reflective dots on sign posts installed on the side of busy highways, completely unaware of their meaning.\n\nWhile the simple circles may not appear important, they can in fact be a vital sign for travellers.\n\nExperienced Aussie caravanner Keith \u2018Harry\u2019 Hodges, who documents his adventures online, said many recent campsite chats have revealed just how few people are aware of the green dot road initiative.\n\nIt was created several years ago by road safety advocate and truck driver Rod Hannifey, who was routinely trying to find a good spot to pull over because he was tired \u2014 but by the time he found one, he would be passed it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApproximately 500 meters from a safe place to pull over, drivers will notice three green dots under the standard red reflector. Getting closer, two green circles will appear on the post indicating the pull-over spot is about 250 metres ahead. Finally, one green circle appears just before the rest area.\n\n\u201cThese green dots can be found more and more on New South Wales and Queensland roads,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cThey are not limited to just trucks, motorhomes or car and caravans, they are there for any motorists to pull over and let traffic past.\u201d\n\nApproximately 500 meters from a safe place to pull over, drivers will notice three green dots under the standard red dot. Getting closer, two green circles will appear. Source: Keith \u2018Harry\u2019 Hodges/Facebook\n\nMore road markers rolled out across south NSW\n\nIn January, Transport for NSW announced it had marked 14 new green reflector sites \u201con important freight routes\u201d in the state\u2019s south to improve road safety. Since 2020, on average there have been 47 fatal crashes involving heavy trucks each year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe rollout of more reflective markers \u201cwill go a long way in enabling truck drivers to stop and rest on what can be very long journeys, particularly at night,\u201d Minister for Regional Transport and Roads Jenny Aitchison said.\n\nHannifey described the move as a \u201cbig win\u201d.\n\n\u201cGreen reflector sites have made a real difference out on the road. Another driver told me it had saved their life. It\u2019s such a simple idea, but it\u2019s already saving lives,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the concept was designed for heavy transport, you don\u2019t need to be a truck driver or towing a caravan to use the space indicated by the dots, as any motorist can pull up in the safe zone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe sites can be used as a safe place to stop if you\u2019re towing a heavy vehicle and traffic is piling up behind, or if you need a break from driving. However, the areas are not suitable for overnight or extended stays.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
