        "text": "Two people who were among the first on the scene of the shark attack at North Steyne Beach yesterday have opened up about the moment the victim was pulled to shore - including the action that potentially saved his life.\n\nA man believed to be aged in his 20s was surfing at the Manly beach when he was bitten at about 6.20pm yesterday.\n\nHe was pulled from the water with serious leg injuries by members of the public, who also provided first aid before emergency services arrived.\n\nA man was bitten by a shark at North Steyne Beach in Manly yesterday. (Nine)\n\nOne of those men, Dayan Neave, used his board's leg rope as an \ufeffemergency tourniquet after the man passed out.\n\n\"Growing up at the beach and hearing other stories of other surfers that have been in similar situations, it was just the first thing that popped into my mind, just to grab a leg rope just in case you needed it,\" Neave told Today .\n\nNeave said the surfer had \"fought the whole way in\" as he was assisted to shore by two others in the water.\n\nREAD MORE: Young girl among three dead in horror Queensland crash \ufeff\n\nDayan Neave and his friend Max White were early on the scene at the North Steyne beach attack. (Today)\n\n\"He was paddling with the other two that were assisting him like absolute champions,\" Neave said.\n\n\"I mean, they would have been scared that the shark was going to attack again, and they helped him the whole way in\ufeff.\"\n\nWith the surf getting rough near the beach, Neave said, the bite victim managed to get on his board and catch a wave in, where he was helped out of the water before he passed out.\n\nThe man remains in a critical condition. (Courtney Robinson)\n\nNeave, a surfer himself, said it would probably be a while before he took to the waves again.\n\n\"I know at the moment there's just been more sharks up and down the eastern coast of Australia than anyone's ever seen ... it's actually radical,\" he said.\n\n\"So I don't really want to go out for a\ufeff while.\"\n\nA bull shark is believed to have carried out at least one of the recent attacks. (Getty)\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said the victim had been saved by \"extraordinarily good luck\" and praised the efforts of bystanders\ufeff and lifesavers.\n\n\"We actually had a group of surf lifesavers in the surf club at the very moment, doing CPR training of all things, so they were able to immediately respond out of the surf club, get onto the beach, apply tourniquets, commence CPR,\" he told Today .\n\n\"We had two off-duty doctors also walking nearby. They joined in with the CPR and I think if not for that immediate effort, these life-saving efforts definitely made a major difference with this man's survivability.\ufeff\"\n\nMultiple Sydney beaches have been closed. (Courtney Robinson)\n\nThe man remains in a critical condition.\n\nIt was the third shark attack at a Sydney beach in just over 24 hours, which collectively have prompted the closing of 20 beaches.\n\nAn 11-year-old boy's surfboard was bitten by a suspected bull shark yesterday morning, while a 12-year-old boy was mauled at Shark Beach in Vaucluse.\n\nPearce said the 12-year-old victim was a junior lifesaver from one of SLS NSW's surf clubs.\n\n\"If not for the actions of the police and the ambulance, well, things could have been totally different and they just did such a tremendous job to save one of our people.,\" he said.\n\nSwimmers at still-open beaches have been advised to stay away and avoid murky and low-visibility water.\n\nThe NSW Department of Primary Industries say bull sharks are known to frequent Sydney Harbour, especially during the year's warmer months, and can be found in shallow waterways.\n\nMurky water churned up by rain and storms could also contribute to perfect attack environments.\ufeff",

(AP)\n\nThe publisher has denied the allegations and called them preposterous.\n\nAttorney David Sherborne opened his case overnight (late on Monday AEDT) by saying there was a culture at Associated Newspapers that spanned decades to unlawfully dig up dirt \"that wrecked the lives of so many\".\n\nHe said the company's vigorous denials, destruction of records and \"masses upon masses of missing documents\" had prevented the claimants from learning what the newspapers had done.\n\n\"They swore that they were a clean ship,\" Sherborne said.\n\n\"Associated knew that these emphatic denials were not true. \u2026 They knew they had skeletons in their closet.\"\n\nThe trial in London's High Court is expected to last nine weeks and will see the return of Harry to the witness box for the second time since he made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior member of the royal family to testify in more than a century.\n\nHarry waved cheerfully at reporters and said \"good morning\" as he entered the court building via a side entrance. He took a seat in the back row of the courtroom near Hurley and Frost.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman found dead and surrounded by dingoes \ufeff\n\nHarry waved cheerfully at reporters and said \"good morning\" as he entered the court building via a side entrance. (AP)\n\nThe prince v the publishers\n\nThe case was one of many that has emerged from the widespread phone hacking scandal in which some journalists began intercepting voicemail messages around the turn of this century and continued for more than a decade.\n\nHarry won a court judgment in 2023 that condemned the publishers of the Daily Mirror for \"widespread and habitual\" phone hacking. Last year, Rupert Murdoch's flagship UK tabloid made an unprecedented apology for intruding on his life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.\n\nHarry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media is more personal and goes far beyond headlines that attempted to document his party boy youth and romance ups and downs.\n\nHe holds the press responsible for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. He also blames them for persistent attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, that led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.\n\nSadie Frost is among a group of seven who allege that Associated Newspapers Ltd hired private investigators to bug their cars, obtain their private records and eavesdrop on phone calls. (Getty)\n\nRepairing rift in the royal family\n\nThe trial comes as Harry tries to repair a damaged relationship with his family since he moved to America and burned the bridge behind him by penning a scorching 2023 memoir, Spare , and airing other family grievances in a Netflix series.\n\nFrosty relations with his father, King Charles III, appear to be thawing a bit after the two met for tea last fall when Harry was last in town.\n\nBut a reunion this time looks unlikely.\n\nThe start of the trial coincides with Charles' trip to Scotland and Harry's visit is expected to be limited to the opening of the trial and his early testimony.\n\nAttorney David Sherborne opened the case by saying there was a culture at Associated Newspapers that spanned decades to unlawfully dig up dirt \"that wrecked the lives of so many\". (Getty)\n\nWins and losses before trial\n\nThe case against the Mail was filed in 2022 and has been the subject of several contentious hearings that have led to rulings that each side has claimed as victories.\n\nLawyers for Associated Newspapers had argued that the case should be thrown out because claims dating as far back as 1993 were brought too late. But in a ruling saying the cases have a \"real prospect of succeeding\", Judge Matthew Nicklin said the papers had \"not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow'\" to the claims.\n\nIn the same ruling, Nicklin handed a win to the Mail in saying Harry and the others could not use records that allegedly showed payments by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to private investigators because they had been disclosed in confidence to a government inquiry into phone hacking.\n\nBut Harry's lawyers later got permission from UK government officials to use the documents.\n\nHarry also blames them for persistent attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, that led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020. (AP)\n\nPrivate eye with conflicting claims\n\nA private investigator whose name is on a sworn statement supporting the claims of Harry and the celebrities has filed another statement denying he ever snooped on them.\n\nDuring an early hearing in the case, Sherborne said his clients were not aware they were phone hacking victims until Gavin Burrows and other investigators came forward in 2021 to \"do the right thing\" and help those he targeted.\n\nBurrows said he \"must have done hundreds of jobs\" for the Mail between 2000 and 2005, and that Harry, John and his husband, David Furnish, and Hurley and Frost were \"just a small handful of my targets\".\n\nBut he has since signed another statement saying he had not been hired by Associated Newspapers to do any unlawful work.\n\nIt's unclear what impact his conflicting statements will have on the case.",

Or you just see another girl come off a crazy match and she's really upset. It is a weird dynamic.\n\n\"I think that's special a little bit to tennis that you could be changing and getting ready right next to the person that you're playing, or that you lost to, or that you beat.\n\n\"I think we all have a good awareness. We just don't like to get in each other's way too much if that's the case, but it can be a little tense and a little awkward at times.\"\n\nJessica Pegula says there can be some awkward moments in the locker room. (Getty Images: Phil Walter)\n\nHow does Pegula approach the situation?\n\n\"I just try to stay in my lane,\" she said.\n\n\"It depends \u2014 if you know the person really well and you can't avoid each other, you're probably on the same schedule and you're maybe right next to them, you can small talk and stuff like that.\n\n\"I think it just kind of depends on who it is and what your relationship with them is.\n\n\"But I never try to go out of my way too much to make it a huge deal.\n\n\"I think sometimes when you have your match, you just like to stay in your lane a little bit and keep to yourself.\"\n\nWhen rivals become friends\n\nWhile the locker room features rivalries and competing egos, it can also foster friendships.\n\nFollowing her first-round match at Melbourne Park yesterday, world number four Amanda Anisimova spoke of her close relationship with Aryna Sabalenka and Paula Badosa.\n\nThe trio teamed up to create a TikTok video while contesting the Brisbane International earlier this month.\n\n\"I like both of the girls.

And he was taking photos and, of course, we never got any evidence of this, so we've been trying to find this fella.\"\n\nThe paddocks occupied by the lions were reportedly quite desolate and a far cry from today's standards for animal keeping. (Supplied: Dean Ransom, photo by Peter Read)\n\nAnother listener spoke about the time he visited the park with his children and watched as a woman fed the lions while being towed in a caged trailer.\n\n\"The lions would come up all around the cage, and there was one big lion on top of the cage and suddenly she yelled, 'Bob! He's got my thumb,'\" the listener said.\n\n\" She didn't lose her thumb, but it was in the press the next day so it must have been serious. \"\n\nOthers remembered a sign out the front of the park that announced, among ticketing prices: \"Poms on pushbikes admitted free.\"\n\nOther signs included warnings like: \"Trespassers will be eaten.\"\n\nThere were also unsubstantiated stories about escaped lions \u2014 although one incident that prompted panic was potentially down to a case of mistaken identity with a great Dane.\n\nLions on the loose\n\nMany of the rumours may have stemmed back to an incident in 1964 when four lions escaped a circus at Windsor in Adelaide's north.\n\n'Trespassers will be eaten' It's been 20 years since the closure of Perth's only open-range zoo, where thousands of people once visited for a suburban safari experience.\n\nThe Canberra Times on December 23 and 24 that year reported that the lions roamed free for two and a half hours after mauling and killing their 49-year-old keeper, George Herzog, who was believed to have been feeding them.\n\nOne lion returned to its cage when called, but three others were shot dead by police marksmen and gun shop owner Bill Hambly-Clark, who said he shot a lion from \"25 yards\" (22.8 metres) as it was devouring Mr Herzog's body.\n\nHe shot the other lion as it charged him \"through the bushes\".\n\n\"One of them was in full spring when I dropped it at about six feet,\" Mr Hambly-Clark told The Canberra Times.\n\n\"I shot once and then again. I could see the whites of his eyes, you might say.\"\n\nABC Radio Adelaide listener Freddy said he was staying with friends as a 10-year-old in Gepps Cross at the time.\n\n\"There was about a five-hour period one afternoon in the school holidays where we all had to stay inside while they allegedly caught all the lions,\" he said.\n\nHistoric photos such as this one from 1974 also offer a snapshot into the cars Adelaideans were driving at the time. (Supplied: Dean Ransom, photo by Don Ransom)\n\nIn 1973, after leaving the park with his beaten-up brown Datsun 1200, Dave said he was able to push the dented roof back out and the bonnet, \"but there were all these little pin dents, which we never got rid of\".\n\nHe and his wife never managed to find the person who took photos of the incident but they did see their car again in Alice Springs, many years after selling it \"slightly used\".\n\n\"I saw the car up there some years later \u2014 someone else had bought it and it still had the pin dents in the roof and the bonnet,\" Dave said.",

        "text": "Some UK-Australian dual citizens say they have begun the process of renouncing their UK citizenship amid the fallout from new passport entry rules.\n\nFrom February 25, citizens of the UK will be required to enter it using a valid British or Irish passport or a certificate of entitlement (COE), including those who are citizens by birth through a UK- or Irish-born parent.\n\nIf they do not have either, they will need to face two costly options \u2014 renewing their passport or renouncing their citizenship.\n\nPassport rule change disrupts travel plans From February 25, dual citizens of the UK and Ireland will be required to enter the UK using a valid British or Irish passport, a change causing major headaches for dual citizens with imminent travel plans.\n\nABC has been contacted by hundreds of readers who say they are frustrated and confused by the sudden change.\n\nWhile renewing the British passport may be cheaper, it is not an option for some who do not have the correct documentation.\n\nOthers have weighed up the option and say they do not see the point or benefit of holding both nationalities anymore.\n\nMike O'Connor, who has held Australian citizenship and an Australian passport since 2007, said he believed renouncing his citizenship was the best option.\n\n\"It made the most sense because for me, the UK passport was an irrelevance,\" he said.\n\n\" The British passport has become something that's actively a hindrance and something I would have to upkeep. \"\n\nMr O'Connor's mother, who lives in his hometown of Sheffield, England, is unwell and he said he needed to be ready to travel to England with ease.\n\n\"It's just a matter of time before the call comes to attend a funeral and the irony is my partner is Brazilian and we would travel there together,\" he said.\n\n\"He would breeze through with an ETA on his Brazilian passport and I'd arrive to all this bureaucratic nonsense.\"\n\n'Ditch the thing'\n\nMr O'Connor has begun the process of renunciation by sending the relevant documents to London.\n\nIt will cost just under $1,000 to renounce citizenship.\n\nA new British passport costs less, at about $280, and a Certificate of Entitlement costs $1,100.\n\n\"It's prohibitively expensive, but I thought, 'No, I'm going to do it,'\" he said.\n\n\"It's a bit of an emotional thing for me because I feel like I have been betrayed by this [thing] I never signed up for.\n\n\"First it was Brexit, so the UK passport lost the ability of more ease of travel, and this happened the other day, and I thought, better to ditch the thing.\"\n\nHow the new passport rules for UK dual citizens will work Your guide to new UK passport rules for dual citizens and general entry changes beginning in February.\n\nLynda McDowell was born in Australia in 1965 and lived here for three years before her parents moved her back to the UK and she was brought up in Scotland.\n\nShe emigrated to Australia in the nineties and has not had a British passport since 1995.\n\n\"I've always travelled on my Australian passport and don't consider myself British,\" she said.\n\n\" I don't see what benefit it is to have two passports and there's a risk to travelling with two documents as well. I think it's totally unfair. \"\n\nMs McDowell said it was a personal choice but believes others will follow suit.\n\nThis week she sent the forms off to renounce her British citizenship, a process which could take up to six months.\n\n\"We were meant to go to the UK end of April, so we're sort of sitting in a no-man's-land, but I just can't travel to the UK until that's done.\"\n\nThe British passport is seen as \"irrelevant\" to some Australian dual citizens after Brexit. (UK Government/Reuters)\n\nMs McDowell said it was her only choice as she did not have the appropriate documents for the British passport and did not want to get a certificate of entitlement for a similar price.\n\n\"For me, British citizenship is now meaningless and it's not a lifestyle I would want to adopt and I'm just going to renounce it,\" she said.\n\nMs McDowell said the application was still cheaper than a certificate of entitlement (COE).\n\n\"I always saw my dual citizenship as something that sat in the background. I never thought this would come up,\" she said.\n\nThe UK government described the changes to the passport rules as a \"significant step towards digitising the immigration system and paves the way for a contactless UK border in the future\".\n\nAccording to the British Home Office website, you can apply to give up (renounce) your British citizenship or status.\n\nIf accepted, you'll get a \"declaration of renunciation\" that you can use to show that you're no longer British.\n\nAs part of your application, you may need to provide supporting documentation such as your birth certificate, evidence of your nationality, evidence of your parent's nationality and evidence you will maintain another nationality if you give up your British one.\n\nFor those dual-citizens who do not wish to renew their passport, there are barriers and confusion surrounding renouncement.\n\nGerry Prewett, who was born in the UK in 1953 and migrated to Australia in 1990, would be happy to renounce his UK citizenship but is unsure what that would mean for his UK state pension.\n\n\"When we were going back to the UK, I realised there was no real advantage to having a British passport because my wife doesn't have one, so I didn't bother renewing it any longer,\" he said.\n\nThe 73-year-old migrated when he was 37 and is worried he might not be able to access money he had earned for his pension up until the time he left.\n\nThe UK State Pension is a government-funded regular payment for retirement, based on your National Insurance (NI) contributions, providing a foundation income from the state pension age of 66 years old.\n\nOnce he gets clarity on the payment, he said there would be no other reason to remain a dual citizen.\n\n\"The passport did nothing for me and it was just a cost,\" he said.\n\nRenouncing not an appropriate choice for all\n\nAs of 2023, the ABS recorded 1.1 million UK-born people living in Australia.\n\nBut the choice to renounce dual citizenship may not be appropriate for everyone.\n\nANU associate professor and citizenship expert Danielle Ireland-Piper said she did not believe there would be a broad trend of renunciations by British citizens just yet.\n\n\"I'm not convinced we will see an increase in people renouncing their British passports because there is still a convenience to having one, and you know this captures Irish passports too, where we've actually seen applications for their passports go up after Brexit,\" she said.\n\nAnd for others, it may not be appropriate as the UK Home Office says people's right to live and work in the UK \u2014 and their children's \u2014 will be affected if they give up citizenship.\n\nThey will also lose their right to vote.\n\nFor more information on UK citizenship, visit the Home Office site.",

        "text": "The planned closure of Australia's largest coal-fired power station will be delayed by two years, until 2029.\n\nOrigin Energy's Eraring power station, on the shores of Lake Macquarie, south of Newcastle, was due to shut down in August 2027.\n\nThere was growing pressure for that timeline to be extended after a warning from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) that the grid was not ready, raising the threat of widespread blackouts.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Origin said it had advised AEMO that it would extend the operation of the power plant until April 30, 2029, to \"support energy supply in New South Wales through the energy transition\".\n\nOrigin's chief executive Frank Calabria said a \"range of factors had been considered, including the needs of customers, market conditions and the important role the plant plays in the state's energy system\".\n\n\"Our decision to keep Eraring operating until April 2029 provides more time for renewables, storage and transmission projects to be delivered,\" he said.\n\n\" Good progress is being made on the delivery of new energy infrastructure including major transmission works and projects like our large-scale battery at Eraring, but it has become clear Eraring Power Station will need to run for longer to support secure and stable power supply. \"\n\nWorkers need 'just transition', union says\n\nThe Mining and Energy Union welcomed the decision by saying the extra time would give the plant's 500 workers more time to prepare for its eventual closure.\n\n\"It gives us the ability to continue to do work with the government. We need an orderly and just transition for those workers,\" district president Robin Williams said.\n\n\"We're probably not ready for the power station to close yet with respect to being able to transition those people into alternative employment, so it does give us a little bit more time.\"\n\nMr Williams said Origin had not consulted the union about the decision, which \"came as a surprise\".\n\nNSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe said in a statement that Origin's decision gave \"certainty to workers, the market and energy consumers across the state\".\n\nShe said current energy security projections showed the state was expected to have \"sufficient energy supply when Eraring closes in 2029, thanks to new renewable generation and storage coming online\".\n\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Gordon Ramsay said it was \"no surprise\" to the market Origin had decided to extend the life of the plant.\n\nMr Ramsay said the decision was a \"result of the slower than expected rollout of renewables in Australia (other than rooftop solar)\" which was taking longer than the federal government's forecast.\n\n\"We also assume the government likely has growing concerns about the reliability associated with Australia's aging coal-fired generation fleet and its possible future impact on electricity supply and prices, particularly after Eraring's closure,\" he said.\n\nMr Ramsay believed it might also \"reduce what may have been higher future wholesale electricity pricing in NSW\" had Eraring closed next year.",

O'Connell is ranked 118th in the world and nabbed one of the wildcards from Tennis Australia. Indonesian star takes out former slam finalist J By Jon Healy Indonesia's Janice Tjen has her first Australian Open win after holding her nerve to take down 22nd seed and 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez. Madison Keys is back on form J By Jon Healy (Getty) The reigning women's champion fights off set points for Ukraine's Oleksandra Oliynykova and takes the opening frame in a tiebreak on Rod Laver Arena. Oliynykova will be kicking herself after leading 4-0 in the set and serving for it at 6-4 in the breaker, but couldn't hold on. Keys is turning to her power game and seems to have blown some of the nerves out of her system now. A massive win for Taylah Preston, her first at her home grand slam! J By Jon Healy (Getty) It looks like the tears are flowing Taylah Preston as the Australian wildcard knocks out Shua Zhang 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. It's the first grand slam win for the 20-year-old and avenges in a big way her loss to Zhang in qualifying for the Brisbane International earlier this month. \"Especially the end of the third there I started getting a little nervous, but I just tried to not think about it and just think about playing the point and maybe I did it OK,\" she says. Valentova takes out Joint in straight sets C By Chris De Silva Maya Joint's Australian Open campaign is over in the first round! Czech teen Tereza Valentova takes the match 6-4, 6-4 after holding her nerve to close it out despite being pushed to a deuce as she served for the match. Joint is desperately disappointed as she leaves John Cain Arena. Stars in the stands J By Jon Healy Australia's men's cricket captain Pat Cummins and New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor are watching on at the Australian Open. Keys is back in the swing J By Jon Healy After clearly struggling with nerves and the off-pace play of Oleksandra Oliynykova in the opening few games, defending champion Madison Keys is back into a rhythm and takes a 5-4 lead with five successive games. The serves are being fired in more powerfully, the groundstrokes are flat and fast, and Oliynykova sounds like she's tiring. The Ukrainian has never played a grand slam, so Keys can lean on her experience here. Joint chats to her coach after losing break C By Chris De Silva Maya Joint is officially in trouble against Tereza Valentova. The Aussie No.30 has dropped the last three games and is now down a break in the second set. Valentova has retreated to take a toilet break, leaving Joint to have some dialogue with her coach, who is sitting courtside. Can Joint turn this around? A flip of the script for Taylah Preston J By Jon Healy Shuai Zhang has hit back in the second set against Aussie wildcard Taylah Preston, levelling the match at one set apiece on Kia Arena. Preston won just 38 per cent of points when she landed her first serve, and sprayed 18 unforced errors in that frame. The 36-year-old Zhang looking a bit more composed than her 20-year-old opponent now. Joint grabs an early break in the second set C By Chris De Silva It's been a perfect response from Maya Joint after she dropped the first set. Joint breaks Valentova in her first service game to race out to a 2-0 lead with a service game to come. Madison Keys down two early breaks J By Jon Healy (Getty) Defending women's champion Madison Keys is in a proper battle with Oleksandra Oliynykova on Rod Laver Arena. Oliynykova has an unconventional play style \u2014 slow between points with a hitch in her serve and prominently playing off-pace slice forehands \u2014 and it can take some getting used to. She's broken Keys in the first game of the match and holds after six deuces on her serve for a 2-0 lead, then plays a miraculous cross-court forehand passing shot to secure another break for 3-0 before consolidating to lead 4-0. The Ukrainian is covered in tattoos, with glittering straps on her dress and rocking some flowery face art under her eyes and across her nose. (Getty) Joint goes down a set against Valentova J By Jon Healy (Getty) Maya Joint is broken by Tereza Valentova for a 5-4 lead and the Czech manages to find a rare hold to serve out the set. Joint needs to use this break between sets to refocus lest she find herself another seed knocked out here. Taylah Preston takes the opening set J By Jon Healy (Getty) The 20-year-old Australian wildcard has won a set at her home grand slam for the first time, taking down Shuai Zhang 6-3 in the opening frame on Kia Arena. Preston is keeping the pressure on with her groundstrokes, ripping 12 winners past Zhang, who beat Preston in qualifying at the Brisbane International to start the year. What do we think of these Aussie impressions? J By Jon Healy John Isner, Jack Sock and Sam Querrey offered up some pretty ordinary Australian accents on their Nothing Major podcast. The 'weird dynamic' inside the AO locker room L By Luke Pentony Jessica Pegula draws back the curtain on what the atmosphere is like within the walls of the players' locker room. 'A little awkward': What goes on inside the Australian Open locker room Slippery serves on JCA J By Jon Healy Someone's greased up the service games in the clash between Maya Joint and Tereza Valentova, because no-one can hold on to any of them. The score of 3-3 seems pretty standard through six games, but it's come via four breaks and just two holds of serve. Centre court action about to kick off J By Jon Healy (Getty) Reigning women's champion Madison Keys is about to step onto Rod Laver Arena to begin her title defence. The ninth seed is up against world number 92 Oleksandra Oliynykova, with the pair facing off for the first time. Joint on serve (kind of), Preston breaks straight away J By Jon Healy US-born 30th seed Maya Joint gets off to a rough start on John Cain Arena, sending down two double faults and getting broken in the first game of her match against Tereza Valentova. Valentova looked too powerful from the back of the court and Joint just wasn't getting many, if any, free points with her pretty tame serve.\n\nBut Valentova was similarly poor in her service game and handed the break straight back. Preston, meanwhile, has jumped out to a 3-0 lead over Shuai Zhang with an early break. Two Aussies kicking off day three J By Jon Healy Thirtieth seed Maya Joint and wildcard Taylah Preston are both on court in the first batch of matches today, starting in a couple of minutes.

(ABC News: Chris Gillette)\n\nThe former Australian Medical Association Queensland president said they currently had shortages in vaccines for 18-month-olds and four-year-olds.\n\nDr Boulton said she understood there could be shortages for two-month, four-month, six-month, and eight-month vaccines in the future.\n\n\"We're taking it week by week, we continue to put the orders in in the hope the vaccines will come,\" Dr Boulton said.\n\n\" We're just asking parents to just give us a few days, and we'll keep in touch with them. \"\n\nDr Boulton said her clinic currently still had enough supplies of vaccines for six-to-eight-week-olds, which was a critical stage for newborns.\n\nHowever, she said if those supplies dwindled it was important that parents keep their babies away from sources of contamination until they got their first vaccinations.\n\nCorrespondence seen by 612 ABC shows doctors were told \"worse case scenario\" planning was being enacted to keep supplies on shelves.\n\nDon't panic, government says\n\nA Queensland Health spokesperson said they were working with the Toll Healthcare distribution centre to ensure vaccines were still being delivered.\n\nThe spokesperson said clinics should not be concerned about access to vaccine stock.\n\n\"We acted immediately to ensure Toll guarantees ongoing access to vaccines following an incident at their storage facility,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"This included supporting Toll as they established interim arrangements to avoid any disruption to vaccine supply.\n\n\" Sufficient vaccine stock exists and are available through Toll's interim arrangements. \"\n\nDr Boulton said there were also some shortages with the adult flu vaccine, particularly for the over 65s.\n\nShe said there was currently an unseasonable flu peak going around, and elderly people who were unable to get the flu vaccine should exercise caution.\n\n\"Try to avoid crowded spaces, particularly if you're immunosuppressed or if you have any chronic illnesses that put you at higher risk of flu,\" she said.\n\n\"Make sure you are up to date and that you don't miss that yearly flu vaccine.\"\n\nShe said there were also shortages for the meningococcal B vaccine and the rabies vaccine.",

(ABC Pilbara: Kelsey Reid)\n\nThis month it dropped to its lowest level in nearly 40 years: 10.69 gigalitres, or 16.8 per cent full.\n\nWhen it drops below 18 per cent capacity, the water is not suitable for supply due to poor water quality.\n\nThe immediate alternative is to draw water from the Millstream aquifer, a culturally sacred site for the Yindjibarndi people.\n\nKarlon Parker, 11, cools off at Jirndawurrunha Pool which sits above the Millstream aquifer, east of Karratha. (ABC Pilbara: Kelsey Reid)\n\nWith both reliant on the same rainfall, this adds to the ongoing pressure.\n\nWater Corporation North West regional manager Sharon Broad said hotter conditions and less rain had seen annual inflows drop by 80 per cent over the past 30 years.\n\n\"We're going to have periods of time where there isn't recharge into the surface water or groundwater,\" Ms Broad said.\n\nDespite the record low, she said Water Corporation was not looking to restrict water usage yet.\n\nThe Harding Dam has recorded 11GL this month. Anything below 18GL cannot be taken from the dam. (Supplied: Water Corporation)\n\nMercury rising\n\nAmid the water issues, an extreme heatwave warning has been issued for the Pilbara and Gascoyne, with forecast temperatures getting close to 50C.\n\nIn 2022, Onslow recorded Australia's equal highest maximum temperature at 50.7C.\n\nTemperatures are nearing 50C in the Pilbara this summer, with 49C recorded in Onslow already in 2026.

        "text": "Top End Indigenous ranger groups will be able to continue removing tonnes of discarded fishing gear from Australia's northern beaches under a refunded federal program, which will also expand operations to Western Australia and the Torres Strait.\n\nThe extended program will also include a new focus on prevention work in the heavily fished seas to Australia's north.\n\n\"The majority of this funding will go towards maintaining and expanding the number of rangers, but what we are also doing is investing to try to tackle this problem at its source,\" federal Environment Minister Murray Watt told the ABC.\n\nGhost nets are considered a grave threat to traditional Indigenous food sources and culture. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\n\"What we'll be doing also is funding some work with countries like Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea to work with local fishermen and other people in local communities there to reduce the number of ghost nets and other debris that we see ultimately flowing into Australian waters.\"\n\nThe ocean's least natural predator has come for Australia Illegal fishing is ravaging the world's oceans of fish and shellfish but it is what is left behind that is creating a mess for governments worldwide and of Australia's most remote beaches.\n\nThe renewed Ghost Nets Initiative funding involves a total spend of $25.1 million over the next four years \u2014 a $10 million increase on the previous program, which consisted of $15 million funding between 2021 and its expiry last year.\n\nOf that total, the money will be divided between $20.6 million for ranger groups to clean up beaches and $4.5 million for prevention work with neighbouring countries.\n\nThe renewed funding, which was announced in last month's mid-year budget update, has come as a relief to ranger groups, which were last year unsure whether the program would continue.\n\nDedicated staff who coordinated the beach clean-ups were also left in doubt as to whether their positions would continue to exist.\n\nOcean currents pull discarded fishing gear from the Arafura and Timor seas before carrying them to Top End beaches. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nNorthern Territory and Queensland beaches in the Gulf of Carpentaria are global hotspots for ghost nets, due to ocean currents that pull in discarded fishing gear from the Arafura and Timor seas.\n\nThe nets ravage otherwise pristine wilderness areas, and are seen by Aboriginal people who live on the Arnhem Land coast as grave threats to traditional food sources and culture.\n\nStudies by the CSIRO have found the nets kill thousands of sea turtles on their way to shore.\n\nKeep Top End Coasts Healthy coordinator Adele Pedder said the increased funding was \"fantastic news for everyone who cares about Australia's northern coasts\".\n\n\"These coastlines were some of the most remote and cleanest coastlines in the world and now they're looking like rubbish dumps,\" she said.\n\nBut she said it was regrettable there had been a months-long funding gap during which the program's future was uncertain.\n\n\"That was of great concern to people of the north and Indigenous ranger groups,\" she said.\n\nEnvironmentalists say there is a \"huge demand\" for recycled fishing gear. (ABC News: James Elton)\n\nMr Watt said his office had reached out to ranger groups in the interim to reassure them a new funding deal was on the way, but said it was important the program went through a standard budget process.\n\n\"I recognise that there's been a degree of uncertainty for people, but this is really great certainty now for the next four years,\" he said.\n\n'Turning off the tap'\n\nOceanEarth Foundation managing director Anissa Lawrence welcomed the focus on Australia \"turning off the tap\" by working with countries such as Indonesia, which she said deserved credit for its own progress in managing its fisheries.\n\nIndonesia is a fishing powerhouse, with millions of fishers supplying a vital source of protein for the world's fourth-most populous country. The vast majority of its fishers are small-scale, artisanal operators who use traditional methods and non-motorised boats.\n\nAnissa Lawrence's research found some Indonesian fishers found it difficult to securely tie nets to their small boats. (ABC News: Marcus Stimson)\n\nMs Lawrence said there would need to be \"fishing gear recovery systems\" set up at ports, as well as work to help fishing communities make money from recycled nets, to reduce the ghost nets coming from countries to Australia's north.\n\n\"[You need] collection bins, processes for fishers to be able to dispose of end-of-life fishing gear [and] incentives for the industry to participate,\" she said.\n\n\" There's huge demand for the materials that fishing gear is made of. \"\n\nMs Lawrence has previously researched the reasons ghost nets are discarded, including through surveys with Indonesian fishers.\n\nAn Indonesian fishing vessel captured in the Rowley Shoals off Broome in September 2025. (Supplied: Sophie Kalkowski-Pope)\n\nShe found for some, it was difficult to tie nets onto vessels securely because their boats were too small.\n\nHer research also showed the issue could be due to a lack of navigational tools such as GPS and sonar, making it difficult for fishers to avoid reefs and other obstacles, which could then snag nets, forcing crews to cut them loose.\n\nMs Pedder said she agreed there was a need to support legal fishers, as well as continue to crack down on illegal fishing.\n\n\"This really affects Indigenous culture as well as our tourism industry and our fishing, so it affects everyone,\" she said.",

        "text": "The International Monetary Fund has edged its 2026 global growth forecast higher as businesses and economies adapt to US tariffs that have eased in recent months and a continued AI investment boom that has fuelled asset wealth and expectations of productivity gains.\n\nThe IMF in its World Economic Outlook update forecast global GDP growth at 3.3% in 2026, up 0.2% from its last estimate in October.\n\nThat's even with 3.3% growth in 2025, which will also beat the October estimate by 0.1%, the IMF said.\n\nThe global crisis lender forecast 2027 growth at 3.2%, unchanged from the previous forecast. It has revised global growth rates higher since last July in response to trade deals that have reduced President Donald Trump's tariff rates that peaked in April 2025.\n\n\"We find that global growth remains quite resilient,\" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters, adding that the Fund's 2025 and 2026 growth forecasts now exceed predictions made in October 2024, before Trump was elected to a second term. \"So, in a sense, the global economy is shaking off the trade and tariff disruptions of 2025 and is coming out ahead of what we were expecting before it all started.\"\n\nHe said businesses had been able to adapt to higher US tariff rates by rerouting supply chains, while trade agreements had lowered some duties and China had shifted exports to non-US markets. The latest IMF forecasts assume an effective US tariff rate of 18.5%, down from about 25% in the Fund's April 2025 forecast.\n\nThe IMF estimated US growth for 2026 at 2.4%, up 0.3% from October, due in part to a big push from massive investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure, including data centres, powerful AI chips and power. The IMF edged its 2027 growth forecast a tenth of a point lower to 2.0%.\n\nThe IMF also said technology investment was boosting activity in Spain, which saw 0.3% upgrade to its 2026 GDP forecast to 2.3%, and in Britain, where the IMF kept its forecast unchanged at 1.3% for 2026.\n\nGourinchas said the AI boom posed risks for heightened inflation if it continued at its breakneck pace. But he added that if expectations that AI-driven productivity gains and profits were not realised, this could spark a correction in high market valuations that could crimp demand.\n\nThe IMF report lists AI as among risks that are tilted to the downside, along with disruptions to supply chains and markets from geopolitical tensions as well as new flare-ups in trade tensions.\n\nA Supreme Court decision against Trump's broad tariffs under an emergency sanctions law, expected in coming days or weeks, \"would inject another dose of trade policy uncertainty into the global economy\" if Trump resurrects new tariffs under other trade laws, Gourinchas said.\n\nBut the IMF said AI represented significant upside for the global economy if the investment surge led to rapid adoption and productivity gains were realised and boosted business dynamism and innovation.\n\nAs a result, global growth may be lifted by as much as 0.3% in 2026 and between 0.1 and 0.8% per year in the medium-term, depending on the speed of adoption and improvements in AI readiness globally.\n\nAmong forecasts for other major economies, the IMF said China's 2026 growth would reach 4.5%, down from a stronger-than-expected 5.0% performance in 2025, but 0.3% higher than October estimates. The upgrade reflects a 10% reduction in US tariff rates on Chinese goods for a year as well as continued diversion of exports to other markets such as Southeast Asia and Europe.\n\nGourinchas said China risked running into more protectionist trade policies unless it develops a more balanced growth model that relies less on exports and more on internal demand.\n\nThe IMF forecast euro zone growth at 1.3% for 2026, up 0.1% from the October estimate, driven by increased public spending in Germany and stronger performances in Spain and Ireland. The Fund kept its 2027 euro zone growth forecast unchanged at 1.4%, noting that planned European increases in defence spending would materialise only in later years.\n\nJapan also saw a slight upgrade to 2026 growth due to its new government's fiscal stimulus package, but Brazil was a notable outlier to the improvement trend, with a 0.3% reduction in its 2026 growth rate to 1.6% since October. IMF officials attributed the downgrade largely to tighter monetary policy needed to fight a flare-up in inflation last year.\n\nThe IMF said that globally, inflation was forecast to continue to decline, from 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027. Gourinchas said this leaves room for more accommodative monetary policy that will help underpin growth.\n\n\u2014 Reuters",

This included a higher-grade 123-metre interval running 0.50 per cent copper and 0.13g/t gold. The sheer scale and continuity of mineralisation from near surface reinforces La Verde\u2019s credentials as a potential source of bulk-tonnage open-pit feed.\n\nA second diamond hole also delivered strong results, intersecting a blistering 426m at 0.37 per cent copper and 0.08g/t gold from 194 metres depth. Within that interval, Hot Chili reported multiple higher-grade zones, including 107m grading 0.46 per cent copper and 52m grading 0.50 per cent copper.\n\nImportantly, both holes ended in copper-gold mineralisation, highlighting clear potential for further growth at depth.",

I don\u2019t care what it is, but it\u2019s off the screen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Communications Anika Wells speaking there - encouraging young people to find new activities beyond social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says there are some 2.5 million young people aged between 8 and 15 in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany young users are on multiple social media platforms, but the government says some 4.7 million accounts have been deactivated, removed or restricted so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo with less or no access to social media, how are teens spending their spare time? SBS visited a Scouts Hall in Sydney's north to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I do like art. I do a lot of painting and so it's kind of given me more time to focus on that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo today, for example, I'm going over to the beach to see some friends this afternoon, so definitely doing some more stuff off of my phone with some of my friends in the real world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI went to New Zealand for a camp just recently and everyone was out and socialising and not on their phones and it seemed a bit more fun and enjoyable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEven 16 year olds like Maddy - who are excluded from the ban - are noticing a change:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel like everyone is a lot more chatty now and there's less checking phones and hangouts. And we've honestly been going out a lot more to the beach and to the shops and everything.\u201d butted with (01:16): \u201cIt feels less draining to just be talking to them in person than online or on Instagram.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2020 survey by the eSafety Commission shows teenagers were spending on average around 14.4 hours a week online - with Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook the most popular platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says the ban was introduced in order to minimise young people's exposure to harmful content and improve their mental health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA month into the ban, have the adults in their life noticed a difference in behaviour, habits or mental health?\n\n\n\n\n\nSally is mother to 14 year old Travis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe change has been great. He's just come back from a massive scout camp in New Zealand where previously on a scout camp before, I did get messages quite a lot for him where now it was like, \"Are you still alive? I need proof of life.\" Just because the kids weren't on their phones, which was really cool. Really good to see.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSome research suggests social media is harmful to the mental health of young people.\n\n\n\n\n\nA July 2025 report from the eSafety Commission, titled 'Digital Use and Risk: Online platform engagement among children aged 10 to 15' found more than half of children in this age bracket in Australia had experienced cyberbullying.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also found nearly 1 in 4 children had experienced non-consensual tracking, monitoring or harassment on social media - and around the same amount had experienced online sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\nKids Helpline's Head of Virtual Services, Tony Fitzgerald explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhether it's bullying or whether it's access to or exposure to harmful content, the always on nature and the pressure of young people to always be on social media has then led to negative consequences for them in terms of their mental health, because they're always exposed to that content. They're always exposed to that negative behaviour, and those insults, taunts and bullying behaviour that occurs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSome young people agree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the standards on social media are really high and because I'm only 16, seeing the standards of fully grown adults is really like altering my view of things, so that's been a lot better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut recent research suggests the relationship between social media and young people's mental health is more nuanced.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch by the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics analysed three years of data from more than 100,000 Australian children spanning years four to 12.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found adolescents reporting moderate use of social media generally had the best wellbeing, compared to non-users and those on social media at the highest levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeenagers like 14-year-old Alana are concerned about losing communities and friendships maintained online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLosing these connections that I've made from friends overseas and making them at Scout camps and losing them, it's hard because I can't communicate with them anymore. And I may not be able to see them at any other Scout camps I go to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKids Helpline's Tony Fitzgerald says this is particularly true for young people from vulnerable groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYoung people have grown up, particularly in more recent years, have grown up as having social media as part of their lives. So it becomes a natural way of them maintaining connection with each other. Young people, particularly from vulnerable cohorts who find it difficult to connect with others in more traditional senses can find this as a really powerful way of connecting with others who've gone through similar experiences.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis raises questions about how successfully the ban has been executed and whether it\u2019s achieving its desired outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicholas Carah is Director of the Center for Digital Cultures and Societies at the University of Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA really important part of our duty of care is actually a positive one, which is to say, \"What are we going to do to enable young people to connect, socialise, be creative with each other in the digital world?\" Because that is the world and that is their world now.\u201d ]]\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at least for now - less time online, is opening doors for new hobbies and experiences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have picked up drawing a lot more than I used to. When I was younger, I used to draw a lot as I didn't have access to social media, but now that it's gone again, I've started drawing again.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As the world's billionaires grow richer by the day, a few dozen people in Australia hold more wealth than the bottom 40 per cent of the population combined, according to new analysis by Oxfam.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, Australian billionaires' average wealth grew by almost $600,000 a day, the charity group found.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 3.7 million people, including 757,000 children, were living below the poverty line, according to the Australian Council of Social Service, while many others face mounting financial pressure from rising living costs and increasingly unaffordable housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its annual inequality report, released on Monday, Oxfam noted that ordinary people around the world are experiencing relentless food price rises, with one in four people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, global billionaire wealth last year increased three times faster than the average annual rate over the previous five years.\n\n\n\n\"We're really seeing acceleration in billionaire wealth globally and in Australia,\" Oxfam Australia chief executive Jennifer Tierney told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've added eight billionaires since 2020, and we are now at a total of 48 Australian billionaires. Those 48 people actually have more wealth than the bottom 40 per cent of Australians, so 11 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an inequitable, unsustainable and we think, amoral thing for so few people to have accumulated so much of the wealth of this country.\"\n\n\n\nCalls for a wealth tax\n\nOxfam is calling on the Australian government to introduce a wealth tax, among other measures, to reduce inequality, curb the growth of extreme wealth and generate revenue to fund essential services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024-25 wealth increase alone of Australia's richest man, property mogul Harry Triguboff, was enough to fund the construction of around 10,600 homes, according to Oxfam's analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group estimates that a 5 per cent wealth tax on Australia's billionaires last year could have raised $17.4 billion \u2014 funds that could reduce pressure on housing and childcare costs, extend energy bill relief and increase the humanitarian budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's some very tangible things that can be done to make sure that that inequity doesn't continue at the pace that it has been,\" Tierney said.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News That could include ending the capital gains tax discount and phasing out negative gearing, she argued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got to stop setting policy which benefits the wealthy, like [the] negative gearing and capital gains tax system that allows for people who already have accumulated wealth to invest in housing and then get a tax benefit from that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens have repeatedly proposed a 10 per cent tax on the net wealth of Australian billionaires to bring down the costs of food, medical and dental care, public transport and university education.\n\n\n\nIn a report released in August, the Australia Institute said a 2 per cent wealth tax on people worth more than $5 million (excluding the family home and superannuation) would raise $41 billion per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government would generate another $19 billion per year if it scrapped the capital gains tax discount, the think tank found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is a low-tax country that does not do a good job of taxing wealth,\" Matt Grudnoff, a senior economist at the institute, said at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Correcting this would raise huge amounts of extra revenue for essential services and ease growing inequality in Australia.\"\n\n\n\nConcerns about social cohesion worldwide\n\nOxfam's global report links wealth disparities to political inequalities and democratic backsliding.\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaires are more than 4,000 times more likely to hold political office than ordinary people, the report found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When one billionaire can spend hundreds of millions of dollars to shape political conversations, it shows how extreme wealth can translate directly into political power \u2014 undermining a fair and healthy democracy,\" Tierney said.\n\n\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump, for example, has a net worth of $6.6 billion, and his presidency has been the most lucrative in history, according to Forbes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe received enormous campaign support from the world's richest man, Elon Musk, whose net worth is estimated at more than US$717 billion ($1 trillion).\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve billionaires have served in Trump's administration, according to a Washington Post tally.\n\n\n\n\"We see this every single day across the world right now. This concentration of wealth and billionaires holding power really creates a lot of problems with social cohesion,\" Tierney said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your average citizen sees that they are not benefiting from the system in the same way that the rich and the elite are. This means that people want to rise up and protest and push back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just really a vicious cycle.\"\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence adds a new dimension\n\nIn many markets, a small group of ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations control a large share of news and information platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, with the country\u2019s largest media company, News Corp, forming part of billionaire Rupert Murdoch\u2019s global media empire.\n\n\n\nSome of the world\u2019s largest social media platforms, including X and Meta, are also owned or controlled by billionaires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the other things that we really need to be thinking about is how many billionaires own AI companies,\" Tierney said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While media companies have been able to have an influence on people's perspectives, and putting their spin into communities, AI is just going to accelerate that in a way that I think we can't even fathom.\"\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share A A A\n\nStrickland Metals has come out swinging in the New Year, delivering another impressive set of diamond drill results from its cornerstone Shanac deposit within the company\u2019s Rogozna gold and base metals project in southern Serbia. The latest assays reinforced what has become a familiar theme for the ASX-listed explorer - Shanac is shaping up as a large, long-life system that combines bulk-tonnage muscle with eye-catching pockets of high-grade mineralisation. Core from Strickland Metals\u2019 Shanac deposit in Serbia showing massive pyrite and chalcopyrite in green garnet skarn from 317m depth. The intercept graded 18.1g/t gold equivalent, including 1.8g/t gold, 7.2 per cent copper and 229g/t silver. Three recently completed diamond holes have returned a string of thick gold-equivalent intercepts, further building confidence ahead of an updated resource estimate due later this quarter. The drilling targeted both the heart of the deposit and the eastern margin of its southern extent, with results suggesting the mineralised system remains wide open and far from finished. One of the standout holes delivered a monster 113.4-metre intersection grading 1.7 grams per tonne (g/t) gold equivalent from 451m depth, including a higher-grade core of 28m running at 2.7g/t. Within that, Strickland clipped an even richer 7-metre interval going at 6 grams per tonne gold equivalent\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are pleased to see that the latest holes have also provided further definition of the higher-grade zones within the deposit.\u2019 Strickland Metals managing director Paul L\u2019Herpiniere A second hole, which was stepped out along the eastern side of the southern domain, returned an equally impressive 138.8 metres at 1.2g/t gold equivalent from 271.9m, again highlighting the scale of the system. That broad zone also contained a 22.6-metre slice grading 2.6g/t gold equivalent, reinforcing the notion that the higher-grade zones tend to be repeatable features rather than one-offs. The third hole added further spice by intersecting narrow but punchy high-grade gold, including 2 metres at just under 11g/t gold equivalent from 471m, alongside additional broad mineralised intervals at depth. The timing of these latest results could hardly be sweeter, landing just as gold prices soared into uncharted territory overnight, hitting all-time highs of US$4690 (A$7012) per ounce. After surging an eye-watering 70 per cent over the past year, the yellow metal is showing no signs of easing off anytime soon. Strickland Metals managing director Paul L\u2019Herpiniere said: \u201cThe latest drilling has returned wide zones of bulk-tonnage style mineralisation in the central part of the deposit, with two additional holes confirming extensions of the known mineralisation on the eastern side of the southern part of the deposit. We are pleased to see that the latest holes have also provided further definition of the higher-grade zones within the deposit, with the results to contribute towards an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for Shanac.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrickland says the drilling has continued to sharpen the company\u2019s geological understanding of Shanac, which is hosted within a large skarn system associated with intrusive rocks. The deposit appears to shift vertically and laterally from shallower gold-lead-rich zones into deeper gold-copper mineralisation. This is a classic hallmark of many big magmatic-hydrothermal systems in the area, and hints at plenty more mineralisation yet to be unearthed. That growth potential is already on show across the company\u2019s wider Rogozna project, which hosts a hefty 8.6 million ounces of gold equivalent spread over four deposits, with Shanac carrying the bulk of the load at an impressive 5.3 million ounces. With drilling at Shanac wrapped up late last year, the company is now busy digesting the flood of data and preparing its upcoming resource update. More assays are still pending from other holes across the project, setting the stage for continued news flow in the weeks ahead. Backing it all is a rock-solid balance sheet, with Strickland reporting cash and liquid assets of $41.8 million at the end of September, giving it plenty of firepower to keep the drill bits turning and momentum rolling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgainst a backdrop of strong gold and base metal prices, Strickland looks well placed to turn its Serbian scale story into a genuine market heavyweight as 2026 gathers pace.

Got it Share A A A\n\nHot Chili has served up another encouraging drill update from its rapidly growing La Verde copper-gold discovery in Chile, with the latest results continuing to expand what is emerging as a substantial, high-grade porphyry system just 30 kilometres from the company\u2019s flagship Costa Fuego project. Drillers carefully pull out high-grade core from drill rods at Hot Chili\u2019s La Verde copper project in Chile. The company\u2019s third reported diamond drillhole from its phase two program returned a whopping 495 metres grading 0.38 per cent copper and 0.10 grammes per tonne (g/t) gold from just 3 metres depth. This included a higher-grade 123-metre interval running 0.50 per cent copper and 0.13g/t gold. The sheer scale and continuity of mineralisation from near surface reinforces La Verde\u2019s credentials as a potential source of bulk-tonnage open-pit feed. A second diamond hole also delivered strong results, intersecting a blistering 426m at 0.37 per cent copper and 0.08g/t gold from 194 metres depth. Within that interval, Hot Chili reported multiple higher-grade zones, including 107m grading 0.46 per cent copper and 52m grading 0.50 per cent copper. Importantly, both holes ended in copper-gold mineralisation, highlighting clear potential for further growth at depth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Wide, near-surface, copper-gold intercepts from a new major discovery underscores the strategic significance of La Verde to Hot Chili.\u2019 Hot Chili managing director Christian Easterday Drilling has restarted following a short holiday pause, with assays still pending for six additional holes, including two that visually logged broad zones of strong copper porphyry-style mineralisation from shallow depths. Management says the results confirm the ongoing expansion of La Verde\u2019s high-grade core underscores the discovery\u2019s strategic importance to Hot Chili\u2019s Costa Fuego operations, which the company plans to use as a central processing hub in Chile\u2019s coastal Atacama region. Hot Chili managing director Christian Easterday said: \u201cHot Chili is delighted to report these compelling assay results from La Verde, with more expected soon. Against a strong backdrop of record copper and gold prices, the reporting of wide, near-surface, copper-gold intercepts from a new major discovery underscores the strategic significance of La Verde to Hot Chili.\u201d La Verde is well-positioned just down the road from Costa Fuego\u2019s planned central processing hub, in the Huasco Valley Region north of Santiago and is ideally located to potentially add further feed to the proposed mill should it develop into a mining operation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCosta Fuego comprises the Cortadera, Productora, Alice and San Antonio deposits and is regarded as one of the better undeveloped copper resources globally. It has a mammoth combined resource of 798 million tonnes grading 0.45 per cent copper equivalent, for 2.9 million tonnes of copper, 2.6 million ounces of gold, 12.9m ounces of silver and 68,000t of molybdenum. Geologically, Cortadera and Alice fit the mould as classic copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry systems, while San Antonio is interpreted as a lode-style copper skarn \u2013 the kind of mineralisation commonly developed on the fringes of intrusive bodies and porphyry centres. Rounding out the suite, Productora is thought to be a tourmaline-breccia hosted copper-gold-molybdenum system, adding yet another layer of geological diversity to the district. The company believes its Costa Fuego project is a global standout among a limited number of independent, large-scale copper operations nearing development, with strong exposure to rising prices. Impact modelling by Hot Chili suggests La Verde could add significant open-pit material to the front end of Costa Fuego\u2019s proposed 20-year mine schedule, potentially extending mine life and materially improving the financial metrics outlined in Hot Chili\u2019s March 2025 pre-feasibility study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of these results could hardly be better after copper prices reached all-time highs of US$6.15 (A$9.20) a pound at the start of the week, notching up a stellar 53 per cent rise in the past 12 months alone. Long-term consensus prices now sit at around US$4.51 per pound for copper and US$3,137 per ounce for gold \u2014 both well above the assumptions used in the pre-feasibility study \u2014 meaning any additional near-surface tonnes could deliver outsized value. As drilling continues to target extensions to the high-grade core as well as lateral and strike growth, punters can expect further news flow in the near term. Consistent thick intercepts, shallow mineralisation and substantial leverage to buoyant copper and gold markets all point to La Verde fast shaping up as a compelling growth engine within Hot Chili\u2019s broader Costa Fuego development strategy.
