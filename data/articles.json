This particular sculpture was modelled in 1890 and sculpted from marble in 1892 to 1893.\n\nLe Desespoir (Despair) by French sculptor Auguste Rodin. (Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty Images) (CNN)\n\nMeasuring just 28.5cm by 15cm by 25cm, the sculpture was originally modelled to form part of Rodin's monumental work The Gates of Hell , which features more than 200 figures and groups.\n\nThe previous owners \u2013 a family from central France \u2013 had no idea of its value and had displayed the sculpture on top of a piano alongside family photos, auctioneer Aymeric Rouillac told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n\"They said 'it's a fake, it's a copy,'\" Rouillac said, but he decided to investigate further.\n\nThe details of this sculpture are striking, Rouillac told CNN.\n\n\"The back, the muscles, they are perfect,\" he said. \"You can feel every vertebra in the spinal column.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Bank staff catch red flags that nearly cost woman her life savings\n\nFrench sculptor Auguste Rodin. (public domain)\n\nFollowing his own initial investigation, Rouillac took the sculpture for assessment by the Comite Rodin, which maintains a catalogue of the artist's work.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jerome Le Blay, co-founder of the Comite Rodin, told CNN that he was immediately struck by the \"exceptional\" piece.\n\n\"I realised in a second that it was real,\" he said. \"I had absolutely no doubt.\"\n\nThis particular example is \"extremely well made,\" said Le Blay, adding that it dates back to a period when Rodin was dedicating a huge amount of time to making a small number of sculptures.\n\nRodin would have worked with assistants who would have carried out the initial work on a piece of marble, before he performed the final stages, he explained.\n\nREAD MORE: Amazon launches new service in Australia for business owners\n\nThe fine detail on one of the feet in the sculpture \"Le Desespoir\". (Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty Images) (CNN)\n\nAccording to Le Blay, the sculpture dates to \"one of the best moments of Rodin's career,\" before his growing fame meant that he started to produce more and more works after the turn of the century.\n\nUpon his death, Rodin left his works to the Musee Rodin in Paris, as well as granting it permission to continue producing his bronze sculptures.\n\nWhile many of these posthumous bronzes go under the hammer each year, marbles are much harder to find, said Le Blay.\n\nMost of Rodin's marbles are owned by the Musee Rodin or by other large museums around the world, he said.\n\n\"Marbles in private collections are rare,\" he said, adding that this piece has a \"kind of magic\" due to the fact that it has reappeared for sale after such a long time.",

        "text": "The ABC will discontinue its weekly panel show Q+A after 18 years, the public broadcaster has announced.\n\nThe show, hosted by Patricia Karvelas since 2023, will not return after its hiatus, which started last month.\n\nThe ABC's news director, Justin Stevens, said Q+A had made a huge contribution to the national public discussion.\n\n\"We're very proud of Q+A's great achievements over the years. The team has done a terrific job, including a strong performance during the federal election campaign,\" he said.\n\n\"Discontinuing the program at this point is no reflection on anyone on the show.\n\n\"We always need to keep innovating and renewing and, in the two decades since Q+A began, the world has changed.\n\n\"It's time to rethink how audiences want to interact and to evolve how we can engage with the public to include as many Australians as possible in national conversations.\n\n\"We'll be working on how we can continue to foster engagement of this nature in an innovative way.\"\n\nKarvelas will continue hosting Afternoon Briefing and the popular Politics Now podcast along with writing her column for the ABC News website.\n\n\"Patricia also recently reported for Four Corners, and we've now asked her to do more for Four Corners as time permits,\" Stevens said.\n\nFouding Q&A host Tony Jones and executive producer Peter McEvoy helmed the show for 12 years. (ABC News)\n\nThe Q+A proposal would result in some redundancies, Stevens told ABC staff in an email.\n\nThe ABC also announced it would invest in producing more news documentaries, with a new position of executive producer, documentaries and specials to be advertised soon.\n\nIt will also make the Your Say project \u2014 launched during the recent federal election \u2014 a permanent initiative to drive audience engagement in communities around the country.\n\n\"Your Say ensures we have a strong framework for putting the public's views, concerns and questions at the heart of our journalism, complementing our daily commissioning and reporting,\" Stevens said. \"We're keen to see what else we can do with this.\"\n\nAudience-powered journalism\n\nLaunched by founding executive producer Peter McEvoy and host Tony Jones in 2008, Q+A was an agenda-setting program that pushed politicians beyond their standard talking points.\n\nThen-prime minister Kevin Rudd appeared solo on the first episode, before the second episode introduced the regular format of five panellists, including politicians from across the spectrum and others in public life.\n\nQ&A crew sign off after 12 years Photo shows Jones and McEvoy standing in front of Q&A sign with arms around each other. Reflections on the memorable and sometimes controversial moments of Q&A.\n\nWhat made it stand out from other panel shows was the role of the audience, who led the questioning in the studio or via video and social media.\n\nMcEvoy said in 2019 that the audience was the show's biggest challenge and its strength.\n\n\"An ordinary panel program just has to wrangle four or five guests,\" he said.\n\n\"Q&A has to manage 300, 400 \u2014 up to a thousand audience participants \u2014 recruiting, registering, checking identities, keeping them informed, generating and choosing questions.\"\n\nWith the audience asking the questions, the conversation could go in unexpected directions, giving a platform to people who were not being heard in other areas of public life.\n\nBut not every question took the conversation forward, earning Jones's signature line, \"I'll take that as a comment\".\n\nWhen Jones left the show in 2019, Hamish Macdonald joined as host for 18 months, before resigning. He was replaced by rotating hosts David Speers, Virginia Trioli and Stan Grant, before Grant took the role on solo.\n\nGrant resigned from the program in May 2023 after sustained racist abuse and trolling, saying on his last show: \"To those who have abused me and my family, I would just say \u2014 if your aim was to hurt me, well, you've succeeded.\"\n\nPatricia Karvelas has hosted Q+A for the past two years.\n\nTributes to staff, panellists\n\nStevens paid tribute to the many people who had worked on screen and behind the camera over the show's 18-year run.\n\n\"I want to call out current executive producer Eliza Harvey and presenter Patricia Karvelas. They are hugely talented journalists who have done an outstanding job with Q+A in recent years,\" he said.\n\n\"Many extremely talented and dedicated people have worked on Q+A, as presenters and behind the scenes.\n\n\"I extend our sincerest thanks to them all, and to everyone who has contributed as audience members and panellists.\"\n\nKarvelas said she had immensely enjoyed being part of the program.\n\n\"Spending time with the audience members who came to Q+A late on a Monday night has been the best part of this job,\" she said.\n\n\"They have always been the reason for this show and I'm forever grateful to them for coming on national TV and having the courage to ask questions of powerful people.\"\n\nThe Project axed\n\nThe news comes in the same week Channel Ten has axed its long-running nightly panel show The Project, after almost 16 years and 4,500 episodes.\n\nThe show's hosts, Waleed Aly, Hamish McDonald and Sarah Harris, will leave Channel Ten after the final episode airs on Friday, June 27.\n\nThe network announced a new national \"news, current affairs and insights\" show that will air for an hour from Sunday to Friday.",

        "text": "There's a poetic tilt to the year that the AFLW will enter its 10th season, as its first former players are inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe wider footballing community may have started to take note of the names Erin Phillips and Daisy Pearce when the women's elite competition erupted onto the scene in 2017, but the roots of their impact go far deeper and extend a lot further back than from that first ball up between Collingwood and Carlton at Princes Park.\n\nAs AFLW analyst and commentator Gemma Bastiani pointed out, Pearce and Phillips represent two very different, but equally worthy versions of women in footy pre-AFLW.\n\n\"Erin pursued other sports after being told no, Daisy raised the standard of the then-VWFL to force the AFL's hand,\" Bastiani wrote on X.\n\nThe timing of the AFLW's introduction being brought forward to 2017 from 2020 meant that Pearce and Phillips got to play at the top level, but its delayed start meant we never really got to see them in their prime.\n\nErin Phillips, crouching in the middle of shot, during a WNBL promotion shoot in 2005, when she played for the Adelaide Fellas. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nAfter being forced away from football age 13, Phillips turned to basketball. There, she made herself known on the international stage, becoming a two-time WNBA champion, world champion, Commonwealth gold medallist and Olympic silver medallist.\n\nWhen the whispers came that the AFLW may be forming, she made the courageous choice to follow her first calling. She packed up her family in the US and moved back to Australia for the competition's first iteration in 2017.\n\nExternally, she brought gravitas, excitement and, importantly, eyeballs to the competition. Internally leadership and belief in what they were building.\n\nErin Phillips left the AFLW as the most decorated player in the league's young history. (Getty Images: Dylan Burns/AFL Photos)\n\nShe left the game as the most decorated elite women's football player to date: a three-time premiership player, two-time league best and fairest, three-time All Australian, two-time grand final best on ground and two-time club champion.\n\nPearce, on the other hand, carried the weight of being the face of the newly formed AFLW.\n\nIn 2013, when women's football pioneers were pushing for a professional competition, Pearce was taken by Melbourne with the first pick in the inaugural national women's draft for the first women's exhibition game.\n\nDaisy Pearce thanks the crowd playing in a curtain raiser at MCG in 2013. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nShe then became a marquee signing for Melbourne and entered the competition a 10-time VWFL/VFLW premiership player with Darebin, where she was captain between 2008 and 2016.\n\nIn her Hall of Fame speech, Pearce said she carried a weight in those early days of feeling like they had to put on a good spectacle, kick enough goals, gaining enough attention, as the future of women's footy was riding on their shoulders.\n\nPearce ended her speech honouring the ones that came before her, the pioneers who never got to play at the top level. The likes of Debbie Lee, Peta Searle and Jan Cooper.\n\nHighlighted in both stories on the night was that they used to run around with the boys as kids, as there were no girl teams for them to play in growing up.\n\n\"I never wanted to be a boy,\" Phillips said in her speech.\n\n\"I just wanted the opportunities that boys had, and that was footy.\"\n\nThis is a common story within the first generation of AFLW players, who came from all corners across the country to fight for the right to play and grow the game they love, in the face of fierce adversity and constant pushback.\n\nWithout those trailblazers, spearhead by Phillips and Pearce, we would not have a 10th season to enter into this year.\n\nNow, almost 600,000 women and girls participate in Australian Rules footy across the country.",

(ABC News: Curtis Rodda)\n\nIn the new strategy, the ZEV push will be scrapped and a new target will be introduced, aimed at lowering the entirety of QFleet's tailpipe emissions by 10 per cent by 2030.\n\nThe plan will allow for other vehicles beyond electric vehicles to be used, such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\n\nMr O'Connor said every government agency would be held accountable to reduce their emissions, rather than buying a particular type of car.\n\n\"We're not here to tick boxes \u2014 we're here to focus on outcomes,\" he said.\n\n\"We've laid out a genuine pathway to reduce tailpipe emissions and better support the hardworking public servants who rely on QFleet to get them to where they need to be.\"\n\nSam O'Connor says the government should focus on results, not what type of car they use. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\nPlans to increase fleet size\n\nThe new strategy would see the fleet's tailpipe emissions lowered from 33.19 kilotonnes as of June 2024 to 29.86 kilotonnes by 2030.\n\nOver the same period, the government wants to grow the fleet of vehicles by about 9 per cent.\n\nThe strategy notes the plan was put together in response to \"significant\" feedback from government agencies, particularly public servants in regional areas.\n\n\"The [emissions reduction] strategy will mean for the first time the progress of total fleet emissions reduction is being monitored rather than just the number of EVs introduced,\" it said. \"This expansion of scope will provide the government with a more accurate account of its progress towards net zero emission targets.\"\n\nThe Queensland government has a target for the state to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe new plan will aim to reduce tailpipe emissions by 10 per cent. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)\n\nThe previous strategy rolled out by the former Labor government, which included the ZEV mandate, projected the fleet's emissions would drop to 26.7 kilotonnes by 2025-26.\n\nIt also argued a transition to electric vehicles would result in \"significant savings\" for taxpayers through running costs, such as fuel.\n\nEmissions targets under review Photo shows a high voltage power line in front of a cloudy, stormy sky Queensland's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets will be reviewed, with the treasurer saying gas will play a \"critical role\" in supply reliability as the state shifts to renewables.\n\nAnother aim of the plan was to increase the availability of second-hand electric vehicles in the used car market.\n\nThe ZEV mandate meant that as a vehicle lease expired, a zero-emission vehicle had to be taken up as long as there was a ZEV alternative and sufficient charging infrastructure was available.\n\nThe government's new QFleet strategy points out the fleet already has more than 2,000 active EVs.\n\n\"Thoughtful vehicle selection\" and \"responsible driving behaviour\" are among the measures it lists in its bid to cut vehicle emissions.",

(AP Photo)\n\n\"That's the mentality the boss has created within us, we didn't get fazed by the one-goal deficit and we bounced back,\" Duke said.\n\n\"This group is so special and so mentally tough,\" Metcalf added.\n\n\"It's hard to beat us.\n\nFive quick hits: Dazzling Duke, Mat's magnificence, and the red card that wasn't Photo shows SoccerQH Mitch Duke scored a goal and set one up, Mat Ryan pulled off a superb penalty save in his 100th Socceroos match, and there was mystery around a red card that wasn't.\n\n\"I think that's been a characteristic since the first day I arrived,\" added Popovic, who saw his charges come from a goal down in his first game in charge against China, hold Japan to a draw in his second, rescue a point from a goal down in Bahrain in his fourth, and then record back-to-back wins over two of Asia's biggest teams in Japan and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"To show that character, resilience, to come back and win the game\u2026\" he added.\n\n\"We've built a good foundation now.\"\n\nPopovic has every reason to be happy.\n\nHe is now eight games unbeaten since taking over the job, turning a floundering ship away from the troubled waters they found themselves in at the start of qualification.\n\nAll aboard the Socceroos World Cup party bus. (AP Photo)\n\nOf course, not many of these matches have been of the free-flowing style that some may prefer.\n\nIndeed, of the eight matches Popovic has presided over, just three have seen the Socceroos hold the majority of possession \u2014 both home and away victories against China and the 2-2 draw in Bahrain in November.\n\nAnd yet, only twice have the Socceroos allowed more shots on target than they have managed themselves: In the 1-1 draw against Japan in Saitama \u2014 Japan had three shots on target to Australia's zero \u2014 and in Wednesday's victory over Saudi Arabia, when the Green Falcons managed six shots on goal to Australia's three.\n\nIndeed, the Socceroos have had fewer shots in total than their opponents in five of their eight matches under Popovic (with one level).\n\nBut they've still not been beaten, their conversion rate is superb.\n\nAfter some wayward shooting in the first three matches under Popovic, when just six of the 32 shots the Socceroos had were on target for four goals, in the five matches since then, Australia has had 20 of its 35 shots on target and scored 12 goals.\n\nThe six shots on goal that they conceded against Saudi Arabia in Jeddah was the same number as the previous three games combined.\n\nIn short, the Socceroos are limiting guilt-edged chances for their opponents, and making the most of theirs. That's perfect tournament football.\n\nConnor Metcalfe (right) levelled for the Socceroos before half time. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nWhile the victory over Japan in Perth defined the very meaning of a smash and grab, this victory over the Saudis in the stifling humidity and heat of Jeddah was a triumph of planning and execution.\n\nSure, Saudi Arabia dominated possession, and territory, and had twice as many shots on target as Australia, but given they needed to win big, that was to be expected.\n\nThe Green Falcons needed goals, five to be exact, to knock Australia out of second spot on the table and steal the second direct qualification spot.\n\nAnd Popovic knew this \u2014 a resolute back five created a defensive shield that no manner of sprightly Saudi attacks could breach with the frequency they required, with Nashville midfielder Patrick Yazbek handed a first start to sit in front of that five in a defensive role to stymie the hosts' inventiveness.\n\nIn the end, Yazbek was simply one member of a four-man midfield that, without the ball, sat deep and added another rampart to the Roos defence.\n\nSaudi Arabia was not to be denied, the brilliant Salem Al-Dawsari creating magic and dragging the Green Falcons into the lead early enough in the piece to create a murmur of concern through the Socceroos ranks.\n\nConceding, given the situation, was not unexpected, but fighting back and taking the chances that came their way shows resilience and character in this team that proves it is capable of doing great things.\n\nMilo\u0161 Degenek celebrates Mat Ryan's save to deny Salem Al-Dawsari. (Getty Images: Yasser Bakhsh)\n\n\"It's exciting,\" Popovic said.\n\n\"We want to really get better, kick on and try and do something special at the World Cup.\n\n\" We wanna be a squad that's much better than we are now, and that's the expectation we should have. \"\n\nThat should not be beyond the realms of possibility.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWith a solid foundation and a year of international windows for Popovic to trial new combinations without the pressure of needing wins, is another fairytale run in North America really beyond reach?\n\nThe Socceroos are likely to be written off by the rest of the world.\n\nBut as Japan and Saudi Arabia will tell them, this Socceroos team are far from being pushovers.\n\nNobody is suggesting that the Socceroos head to this bloated, 48-team World Cup among the favourites.\n\nBut football is a funny beast, and stranger things have happened, and few would relish the challenge of dismantling a defence that is likely to be bolstered by Harry Souttar's immense presence when he recovers from his Achilles tear.\n\nDare to dream?

(ABC Tropical North: Liam McNally)\n\nHabana and Districts Progress Association secretary Palmina Rae said the expanded line-up reflected how much cane farming meant to the community.\n\n\"We wanted to gather everybody who's involved in the industry, that includes teachers, ambulance drivers, everybody is contributing to our local sugarcane industry,\" she said.\n\n\"It means a lot to me, it's a tradition, it's an opportunity for us to celebrate our faith but also to celebrate the sugar industry, which is a big part of the history in Habana.\"\n\nSymbols of the harvest are displayed on the altar. (ABC Tropical North: Liam McNally)\n\nReduced tonnage expected\n\nCanegrowers chair Owen Menkens said the industry was under pressure with a couple of years of less-than-ideal conditions in Australia's sugar industry.\n\nHe said the organisation expected 28.5 million tonnes of sugarcane to be harvested from 13 districts in Queensland.\n\nHe said the smaller-than-average crop was due to flooding in the Herbert region north of Townsville and about 1 million tonnes of cane being left in the paddock from last season.\n\n\"Last year was a pretty bad year,\" Mr Menkens said.\n\n\"We had some wet weather as well as some poor mill performance issues, and that's why we have a smaller crop this year.\"\n\nMany farmers were still harvesting into January this year, which was at the top of cane farmer Stephen Vella's mind as he received his blessing at harvest mass.\n\nSteven Vella and his granddaughter attend the mass. (ABC Tropical North: Liam McNally)\n\n\"We're praying that the mills have a good run, that we can get the cane off within that 23 [or] 24-week period,\" Mr Vella said.\n\n\"And just for once to sit and enjoy the last couple of weeks before Christmas instead of having to harvest cane and do farm chores.\"\n\nMore mills to fire up\n\nMackay Sugar is Australia's second-largest raw sugar producer with almost 1,300 mainly family-owned farms supplying its three mills.\n\nLast year, the company contributed about 800,000 tonnes of raw sugar to the 4 million tonnes produced in Queensland.\n\nThe first bin of cane was tipped at Farleigh Mill on June 10, with Racecourse and Marian Mill to fire up in the coming week.\n\nThe crush is already underway in Far North Queensland on the Tablelands, Tully, the Burdekin, Sarina, and Bundaberg.\n\nThe Herbert River and Isis mills are expected to start crushing within the next two weeks.",

        "text": "The Socceroos have done it, beating Saudi Arabia 2-1 in Jeddah to confirm their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup finals.\n\nOnly needing to avoid a massive defeat, the Socceroos went behind early, but fought back to win a wild game played out in 31-degree temperatures in the Middle East.\n\nHere are the five quick hits from the King Abdullah Sports City stadium.\n\n1. Saudi Arabia score opener after bad Boyle miss\n\nThe Socceroos were always going to be under pressure in Jeddah, meaning that they would need to take any chance that came their way.\n\nThat first chance came in the 18th minute, when Martin Boyle was played in on the edge of the penalty area after Hassan Kadesh gave the ball away cheaply.\n\nBoyle, who has scored 11 Premiership goals for Hibernian this season, should have done better, flashing his shot wide of the far post.\n\nAbdulrahman Alobud scored the opening goal to give Saudi Arabia hope. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nLess than a minute later, Saudi Arabia had the lead.\n\nSalem Al-Dawsari worked his way into the box with a scything run and then his low cross was spun into the net by Abdulrahman Al-Obud on the line.\n\nThe Socceroos appealed in vain for offside but the goal stood and the pressure mounted.\n\n2. Duke's magic pass and Metcalfe's maiden goal\n\nThere is never a bad time to score your first goal for your country, but there sure is a great time.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia pressing, the counterattack was always going to be the Socceroos' best chance of breaking the shackles, and so it proved when a long ball was gathered by Mitch Duke out on the left touchline.\n\nHe held the ball up brilliantly before flicking it back inside perfectly into the path of the rampaging St Pauli midfielder Connor Metcalfe, who hammered the ball into the ground and over the despairing, flailing arms of the Saudi keeper to score his first goal in green and gold.\n\nGiven injury has limited the 25-year-old to just 10 Bundesliga appearances this season, he may have felt a moment like this would be a long way away.\n\nBut his composure under pressure allowed the Socceroos to extinguish any hope the Saudis had of the dramatic goal-fest victory they so desperately needed.\n\n3. Duke nails his moment\n\nMitch Duke probably wasn't going to be in this squad, only being brought in when Mat Leckie went down with an injury.\n\nBut now he's here, boy did he make his moment count.\n\nThe assist for the Socceroos' first goal was special, but the header for the winner was much more in his wheelhouse.\n\nA perfect delivery, a perfect leap, and the perfect sound of silence as the ball bulged the back of the net and the Jeddah crowd felt their dreams of direct World Cup progression evaporate.\n\nDuke's goal makes him just the sixth Socceroo to score a goal and provide an assist in a match outside of Australia since 2015.\n\n4. The send-off that wasn't\n\nOnce again it was the Socceroos counterattack that paid off, leaving Saudi Arabia desperately exposed at the back.\n\nDuke and Boyle combined up top to latch onto a through ball only for Boyle to hit the deck.\n\nAli Majrashi was the closest player and referee Abdulrahman Al Jassim did not hesitate in reaching for the red card.\n\nAli Majrashi was sent off, then he wasn't. (Getty Images: Yasser Bakhsh)\n\nExcept, that wasn't quite it.\n\nAl Jassim was called over to the monitor after a lengthy VAR check and saw that there was barely any contact on Boyle and so the red card was rescinded.\n\nBoyle, by the way, was already on a yellow card and may have momentarily been worried that he could have been sent off for simulation.\n\nHowever, VAR cannot rule on yellow card incidents so he remained on the pitch, albeit a little miffed that he had not been fouled.\n\n5. Mat Ryan's star turn\n\nMat Ryan admitted that he felt his career in green and gold may have been over after he was overlooked for Tony Popovic's first couple of matches in charge.\n\nA torrid time in club-land meant that Ryan, despite his experience and expertise, was no certainty to regain his spot.\n\nBut however temporary form is, class remains permanent and by pulling on the gloves in Jeddah, the ex-Brighton man made his 100th appearance for the Socceroos.\n\nMilo\u0161 Degenek celebrates Mat Ryan's save to deny Salem Al-Dawsari. (Getty Images: Yasser Bakhsh)\n\nQualifying for the World Cup may be enough to remember such a milestone match, but that was not going to be enough for the scriptwriters.\n\nWhen Salem Al-Dawsari hit the deck under Jason Geria's challenge, Ryan was to be called upon to preserve his country's lead.\n\nHe did not disappoint.\n\nA good penalty, struck low to Ryan's left, was brilliantly saved by the Socceroos veteran to compound the Saudi's woes and enshrine Ryan into legend.",

(ABC News: Tyne Logan)\n\nMr Handasyde said his businesses had never needed more power but the cost of that energy was starting to hurt.\n\nDespite efforts by some businesses to offset the costs, power price rises have been painful. (Supplied)\n\nHe has gone to extreme lengths to cushion the blow, including installing a vast array of solar panels and batteries at a cost of $350,000.\n\nBut his power bills have still \"gone through the roof in the last 18 months\".\n\n\"It's been a massive jump. Thousands \u2026 thousands more a month,\" he said.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Neil Handasyde\u2019s power costs have leapt about 50 per cent. (ABC News: Tyne Logan)\n\nMr Handasyde is not alone.\n\nUnder WA's energy rules, small-scale energy users such as householders and some small businesses are shielded from the full cost of providing power by state government subsidies.\n\nBut that still leaves most businesses in the state fully exposed to the whims of the state's biggest electricity market, which spans the relatively populous south-western corner of the continent.\n\nThese customers \u2014 those using more than 50 megawatt hours of electricity a year \u2014 are what are known as \"contestable\" customers who can shop around between energy providers.\n\nPower prices are hurting local businesses in Western Australia. ( ABC News: Andrew O'Connor )\n\nEnergy consultant Etienne Quayle is a veteran of the energy system and his brokerage firm represents more than 1,500 clients across the country.\n\nMr Quayle said contestable customers usually benefited from the power of being able to choose where they bought their electricity.\n\nBut the sheer scale of the price rises in the market now means few \u2014 if any \u2014 customers would be feeling the benefit.\n\nEtienne Quayle is the director of Electrical Consultancy WA. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)\n\n\"From our biggest client to our smallest, we do not see decreases anymore, or savings,\" he said.\n\n\"We've changed our discussions with a client from, 'this is how much we can save you', to, 'this is how much we've mitigated the increase.'\"\n\nCoal and gas price jump\n\nAt the heart of the upheaval is the rising cost of generating and transporting electricity.\n\nMuch of that comes thanks to higher coal and gas prices, but experts have also pointed to a sharp rise in the costs of poles and wires amid interest rate hikes and capital spending.\n\nDoubts raised over WA's coal phase-out Photo shows Aerial picture of a coal fired power station in a regional area. WA Labor has been talking up the clean energy transition ahead of the state election.\n\nOn top of this, Mr Quayle noted significant pressures from services and new infrastructure such as batteries needed to back up the power system.\n\nAs part of a shake-up of the market that came into effect in late 2023, these costs exploded and although they have since eased, they remain significant.\n\nHe said these services and new assets were the insurance premium WA paid as a stand-alone grid that could not turn to anyone else for help.\n\nAdding to the pressure are WA government plans to get out of coal by the end of the decade.\n\nThe coal-fired Muja Power Station in Collie is set to be taken offline by 2030. (ABC South West: Anthony Pancia)\n\nCoal still accounts for almost 30 per cent of the power produced in the state's biggest grid, with the state-owned Collie and Muja among the last three remaining coal plants in the west.\n\nThrough a spokesman, new WA Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson acknowledged medium and large users of electricity were \"directly\" affected by the changes in the electricity market and urged contestable customers to shop around for the best deal possible.\n\n\"The Cook government is delivering on a sensible, managed transition to a greater use of renewables and is committed to getting out of coal by 2030, faster than any other state,\" the spokesman said.\n\nNew capacity shortfall\n\nShadow Energy Minister Steve Thomas is not so charitable or optimistic.\n\nDr Thomas accused the government of mishandling the energy system, pointing to the rising costs across the board.\n\nShadow Energy Minister Steve Thomas says the size of power price rises could imperil some businesses. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)\n\nHe said the government's biggest failure was its inability to build enough new capacity to replace retiring coal plants.\n\n\"If you look at their transition plan, there's not enough generation in the system,\" Dr Thomas said.\n\n\"Whether you want it in renewables or gas, it's still insufficient.\"\n\nWorse still, Dr Thomas said the situation was pushing some businesses to the wall.\n\nNeil Handasyde says power is becoming ever more central to everything his business does. (ABC News: Tyne Logan)\n\nMr Handasyde sees little relief in sight.\n\n\"There's certainly no cheaper power coming our way any time soon, if ever,\" he said.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the mid-2010s, moviegoers embraced the so-called \u201celevated\u201d horror boom, with films such as The Babadook, Get Out, Midsommar and The Witch at the vanguard \u2013 low-budget, high-concept genre fare that used classic horror tropes to probe contemporary societal ills like toxic relationships, racism and mental illness. (The \u201celevated\u201d label was a bit of clever rebranding, like slapping an \u201corganic\u201d sticker on a hamburger; these movies function the same way great horror always has \u2013 you just feel a little less dirty about enjoying them.) Now it seems it\u2019s literature\u2019s turn. In 2023, there was a record number of new horror books both published and sold, and two years on, the trend shows little sign of slowing. Literary agents are reporting submission piles filling up with more tales of the weird and eerie, from eco-horror to folk horror to the aptly named \u201cfemgore\u201d \u2013 hyper-violent, female-centric body horror. In the last year alone \u2013 and this is but a tiny sliver of what\u2019s on offer \u2013 we\u2019ve had Gretchen Felker-Martin\u2019s Cuckoo, which made the very real horrors of gay conversion camps manifest in a grotesque body-snatching teen epic. Rachel Harrison\u2019s So Thirsty took a big, bloody bite out of 21st-century female friendship with its ultra-gory vampire antics. The Lamb, Lucy Rose\u2019s fairytale debut, told the touching story a young girl caring for her mother \u2026 by bringing her stray hikers to satiate her cannibalistic urge for human flesh (pair it with Monika Kim\u2019s The Eyes are the Best Part for a stomach-churning family-sized feast). And 50 years after the publication of his first novel, Carrie, horror stalwart Stephen King released his latest short story anthology You Like It Darker (just months after a brand-new novel, Holly \u2013 also featuring cannibals). The late horror director George A. Romero, whose horror novel has been \u2013 fittingly \u2013 published posthumously. Credit: AP King isn\u2019t the only elder statesman jostling for shelf space alongside the BookTok generation. George A. Romero, the man responsible for our modern conception of zombies, with films like The Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, released his final novel earlier this year, somewhat fittingly from beyond the grave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-written by Daniel Kraus, who discovered the incomplete manuscript in an archive box at the University of Pittsburgh Library in 2019, Pay the Piper is a sweaty, cosmic eco-horror set in the muggy depths of the Louisiana bayou, where a nine-year-old girl named Pontiac and a rag-tag group of townsfolk from her home of Alligator Point come up against an ancient, vengeful evil that\u2019s been lurking in the swamp and preying on children. While Romero will forever be remembered primarily as an orchestrator of gnarly kills and ground-breaking special effects, his zombie movies always had more than merely brains on the brain. His seminal Night of the Living Dead is often read as a critique of racial tensions in 1960s America; it features a Black protagonist (played by Duane Jones) who survives an undead horde only to be shot by a white sheriff. The 1978 follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, set entirely in a shopping mall, can only be seen as a satirical indictment of rampant consumerism. Pay the Piper continues this tradition of smuggling hefty themes into seemingly straightforward horror schtick. Young Pontiac\u2019s home is under threat from a nefarious character known only as The Oil Man \u2013 a phantom-like stand-in for the entire fossil fuel industry \u2013 as well as The Piper itself, an aquatic Lovecraftian creature seeking restitution for the thousands of slaves slaughtered and dumped in its waters by the infamous Pirates Lafitte in the 1800s. Romero and Kraus\u2019 book mutates from gooey Southern Gothic to a full-throated treatise on human cruelty and environmental calamity; it\u2019s spooky, stirring Cajun cli-fi with a healthy dose of tentacles. YA author Margot McGovern has long been a fan of slasher and horror films. Closer to home, this March saw the release of Margot McGovern\u2019s riveting supernatural YA slasher This Stays Between Us. McGovern\u2019s second book boasts a little bit of everything: early 2000s nostalgia, late-night seances, teenage crushes, buried secrets and a predatory entity known only as Smiling Jack that hunts its four young female protagonists as they try to survive year 11 camp in a remote, abandoned mining town. McGovern\u2019s first book, Neverland, released in 2018, hewed much closer to magical realism \u2013 but a life-long love of horror helped inspire her sophomore stab. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a huge horror fan,\u201d says McGovern. \u201cI read and watched a lot growing up, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of Australian horror at that time. Most of the movies came from the US. And with horror books, in the \u201990s it felt like you had R.L. Stine and then there was this huge gap before you jumped to Stephen King and Clive Barker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeen horror films filled that gap for McGovern. \u201cI always knew I wanted to write a book that was set here in Australia and evoked the Australian landscape and personality, but embodied all the fun of a late-90s slasher,\u201d she says. \u201cKevin Williamson\u2019s screenplays were a huge influence on me. I love Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and Teaching Mrs. Tingle \u2013 even movies like The Craft.\u201d A scene from classic 90s slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. Credit: Amazon Prime Of course, the defining feature of all these movies \u2013 and many of the books already mentioned \u2013 is teenagers. In horror, teens are often the heroes, the hapless victims and the target audience all at once. \u201cHorror occupies this really interesting liminal space for teenagers,\u201d McGovern says of her passion for writing YA. \u201cIt gives you that last little bit of make-believe. \u201cIt offers a step up into the adult world, where things can be genuinely terrifying and violent. When you\u2019re 13 or 14, you feel like things are out of your control \u2013 you\u2019re going through this huge transition, you\u2019re figuring out who you are, your body\u2019s changing, all the rules are changing! \u2013 and horror not only explores that, but gives you a way to take back some power and agency.\u201d Perhaps that explains our present-day horror boom, then. We\u2019re all of us teenagers in a world that feels increasingly out of control \u2013 but instead of regressing into childhood and escaping into all-out fantasy, we\u2019re ready to confront our fears; to look the monster under the bed, or the creature in the swamp, or the thing in the mirror dead in the eye. \u201cHorror has always responded to what\u2019s happening in the culture,\u201d McGovern says. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s making such a comeback now. In times of uncertainty and upheaval, horror offers a set of familiar tropes that lets you approach your darkest fears in an almost comforting way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

The catch here is the E before the A, and what began as a fairly harmless, if occasionally wacky, crusade in the minds of philosophers like Peter Singer can, and did, come utterly unhinged when the brutal logic of algorithms is used to maximise the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of altruism. Particularly in the hands of the likes of cryptocurrency lunatics such as Sam Bankman-Fried, and the deluded Scottish philosopher William MacAskill.\n\nBankman-Fried was very keen on EA, and he did give away a lot of money, but as most of it belonged to other people, he was convicted of fraud on a titanic scale in 2023 and consigned to the hoosegow for 25 years. But 25 years is a millisecond to MacAskill, an advocate of \u201clongtermism\u201d, a clumsy word which means that in order to ensure the greatest good for the greatest number, it\u2019s clear (to longtermists, anyway) that we need a lot more people to make happy. More people, indeed, than Earth\u2019s ecology could ever support.",

        "text": "Others, conscious that the US relies on foreign capital inflows to fund its yawning (and rapidly growing) government deficits and debt and enable the government and US citizens to live beyond their means, won\u2019t view the apparent crack in the value of the dollar and the US markets\u2019 status as the world\u2019s safe haven quite as positively. In the near term, the weaker US dollar also means the inflationary impacts in the US of Trump\u2019s trade war on the rest of the world will be exaggerated. A strong dollar, by making imports cheap in US dollar term, would muffle the impact on inflation. \u2018European leaders have recognised the window of opportunity opened by America\u2019s self-destructive trade policies.\u2019 The likely effects of Trump\u2019s war is reflected in this week\u2019s downgrading of the outlook for global and US growth by the World Bank, which sees global growth slowing from 2.8 per cent last year to 2.3 per cent and growth in the US economy halving from 2.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent. That outlook, if it eventuates, would provide even less reason to invest in the US and would result in an even greater reduction in demand for US dollars.\n\nDoes that provide an opportunity for the euro? Perhaps, albeit not one that could be easily or quickly realised. The dollar has reined supreme as the world\u2019s reserve currency in the post-war era and still does. Even though the degree of dominance has been waning in recent years, it still accounts for about 58 per cent of central bank reserves \u2013 it was above 70 per cent in the early years of this century and was still above 60 per cent five years ago \u2013 and about 55 per cent of trade invoicing is denominated in dollars. The US dollar has depreciated about 10 per cent this year. Credit: Bloomberg The euro ranks second on both counts, with a 30 per cent or so share of reserves and a similar share of trade financing.\n\nThe challenge for the Europeans, if they want to challenge the dollar\u2019s status, is that, while they might have the \u201cnext best\u201d currency, they lack some of the foundations that would make it the reserve currency. Loading They do have a floating exchange rate, no capital controls, an independent and respected central bank and an independent and respected judicial system. They don\u2019t have deep and liquid capital markets nor a single economy that is growing consistently and strongly, nor do they have current account deficits to expand the supply of euros \u2013 the European Union consistently runs current account surpluses (and hence is a major target for Trump\u2019s tariffs). The European capital markets are fragmented and shallow \u2013 European companies rely on banks rather than markets as their primary source of funding \u2013 and the condition of the underlying economies varies considerably.\n\nThe closest thing the EU has to a US Treasury bond is a Germany bund but, where the US Treasury market has about $US28 trillion ($43 trillion) of securities on issue, the market for bunds is only about \u20ac1.8 trillion (about $3.2 trillion). That market, thanks to the historic decision to reform the country\u2019s \u201cdebt brake\u201d in order to use debt-financing for what might be a \u20ac600 billion increase in military spending, will grow, but it would still remain small relative to the Treasury market. Loading What could the EU do to create a deeper bond market? It could issue eurobonds, or debt raised on behalf of all its members and backed by all their economies. It has toyed with that idea for decades and, indeed, created a eurobond facility of up to \u20ac800 billion to help member countries recover from the pandemic, although those bonds are supposed to progressively mature and disappear by 2058.\n\nGermany has historically been opposed to the issuance of collective EU debt. It\u2019s strict fiscal discipline means it can borrow more cheaply than other EU members and pay lower interest rates on its debt. With eurobonds, it would pay more and effectively be subsidising the rest of the EU. The prize for the EU as a whole \u2013 a greater share of world reserves, a more stable currency in stressful times, cheaper funding generally and therefore greater economic growth and the geopolitical benefits from having a reserve currency \u2013 is, however, worth striving for. The EU could do more trade in euros \u2013 it buys a lot of energy but pays for it almost exclusively in US dollars, for instance \u2013 it could issue a digital euro to facilitate global transactions, and it could integrate its economies and policies more deeply. While the Europeans have the \u201cnext best\u201d currency, they lack some of the foundations that would make it THE reserve currency. Credit: AP It could also do as the US Federal Reserve Board has done in financial crises, and create permanent swap lines with its major trading partners to provide euro liquidity in moment of stress. That would bolster confidence in the currency.\n\nIt is improbable that the euro could displace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency in anything other than the truly long term. Loading It could, however, increase its share of global reserves and transactions and share some of the dollar\u2019s \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d \u2013 the ability to borrow cheaply without any real limits, the haven status in a crisis, the ability, if they ever transpired, to run trade deficits without any fear of a balance of payments crisis, and, above all, the enhanced geopolitical authority the EU has always sought. European leaders have recognised the window of opportunity opened by America\u2019s self-destructive trade policies \u2013 it\u2019s been a growing topic of conversation in Europe since Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement \u2013 but have also acknowledged the complexities and obstacles to taking advantage of it. Still, small but important steps could be taken, with eurobond issuance at the forefront and, with the EU members committed to ramping up their defence spending in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, this could be an instance where, thanks to Trump and Vladimir Putin, opportunity and need start to converge.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Lunch begins with an editorial intervention. \u201cI want to say, for the record,\u201d Jacqueline Maley \u2013 ever the journalist \u2013 announces. \u201cThat this was on my vision board before Tay Tay came. I was so on the zeitgeist.\u201d We\u2019re dining at Pellegrino 2000, tucked inside a historic terrace in Surry Hills, where the vibe is old-school Italian with a wink. Chianti bottles sit like trophies, tomato tins masquerade as rustic decor, and ropes of dried herbs and spices dangle above the bar. An eccentric collection of framed artwork lines the walls \u2013 including an image of the Michelin Man, beaming over the room like an ironic deity, blessing the carb-loading faithful below. It\u2019s theatrical, yet charming. The perfect setting for a pop star \u2013 or, in Maley\u2019s case, her second novel, Lonely Mouth. Long before Taylor Swift and her gal pal Sabrina Carpenter turned the restaurant into pop culture real estate when they spent the first night of their Eras and Sydney Zoo tour here, Maley was already a regular. She started visiting for the relaxed refinement and crema caramello alla banana (accompanied, no hyperbole, by an entire plate of cream!), but she kept visiting once she realised Pellegrino 2000 also served up perfect inspiration for a novel. Lunch with journalist and novelist Jacqueline Maley Credit: Steven Siewert \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite Sydney restaurants,\u201d Maley says. \u201cThe restaurant I had in mind for the novel was elegant and cool, but it was never going to try too hard or be like a white tablecloth place. I love good food, but I hate any stuffy atmosphere.\u201d Maley would sit at the bar, sketching details in a notepad, absorbing the restaurant\u2019s textures and rhythms. In Lonely Mouth, Pellegrino 2000 becomes the inspiration for the fictional Bocca \u2013 an Italian restaurant with a Japanese twist and a trattoria-meets\u2013art deco aesthetic, located in Darlinghurst. Her narrator, Matilda, works there as the manager: a sharp and solitary 30-something nursing an unrequited crush on the restaurant\u2019s bad-boy owner, Colson, and quietly shouldering the aftershocks of her mother leaving her and her sister, Lara, when they were children (made doubly traumatic by the fact it happened outside the Big Merino rest stop at Goulburn, off the Hume Highway). As a menu reduces a sauce, so too does a plot summary flatten Lonely Mouth. It\u2019s a novel, rich with humour and sharp observations, about desire \u2013 for food, for love, for life \u2013 and what happens when that desire gets swallowed. It\u2019s about sisters, and mothers and daughters. And Bocca becomes more than a backdrop: it\u2019s a space where chaos meets order, appetite meets discipline, and everyone\u2019s slightly hungry for something they can\u2019t quite name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to set the novel in a restaurant. I thought it would be a dynamic setting,\u201d Maley says. \u201cI wanted it to be very realistic. I really wanted the restaurant to be like a character in the book, to be so atmospheric, it would take people there.\u201d Caponata di melanzane: Eggplant, tomato, pine nuts and pickled celery. Credit: Steven Siewert How many times did she visit Pellegrino 2000? \u201cYou should ask my accountant when I put through my next tax return,\u201d Maley quips. Mercifully, we avoid the worst part of Lunch Withs \u2013 the stilted pas de deux over the menu, the self-consciousness of wondering if one\u2019s contributions to the ordering are too much, too little, too indulgent, too virtuous. Maley takes full control, like someone who has asked far tougher questions than \u201cshared plates or mains\u201d? To start, we opt for a pillowy focaccia and truffle-parmesan, an unexpectedly punchy caponata due to pickled celery, and a lush buffalo mozzarella, adorned with figs and honey. The wine stays on theme \u2013 a glass of Italian Pinot Grigio and a sharp Catarratto. Photographer Steven Siewert hovers nearby like a set designer reworking a diorama \u2013 moving errant phones out of frames, opening blinds for better light, repositioning cutlery with surgical precision. Pappardelle al pomodoro: Pappardelle, truss tomatoes and stracciatella. Credit: Steven Siewert \u201cIt is weird to be on the receiving end of what we usually do to other people,\u201d Maley says. She has a deadline for her own Lunch With interview, with a senior public figure, looming. After completing an arts law degree, Maley started at The Sydney Morning Herald as a cadet in 2003. She comes from media stock: her mother, Judy, to whom Lonely Mouth is dedicated, worked at the Herald; her great-grandfather and great-uncle were political journalists; and her brother, Paul, was a reporter at The Australian. Maley\u2019s a senior writer, columnist, podcast host and newsletter editor and, today, the unfortunate soul sitting on the wrong side of the notepad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, Maley\u2019s not entirely unprepared. This isn\u2019t our first time at the Lunch With table together. When her debut novel, The Truth About Her, came out in 2021, we met for breakfast in a courtyard of a cafe that was a little more toast crumbs than terrazzo tables. Now look at us: dining in a hot spot frequented by actual celebrities. For everyone\u2019s sake, I suggest Maley consider setting her next novel in a five-star resort. Jacqueline Maley\u2019s second novel Lonely Mouth is largely set in a restaurant. \u201cWe\u2019re cosmopolitan ladies of the world now,\u201d Maley retorts. \u201cI think we need to really level up. I\u2019m thinking ... Denmark. What\u2019s that place? Noma.\u201d The three-Michelin-star restaurant serves 20-course meals and regularly tops lists of the best restaurants in the world. For Lonely Mouth, Maley became something of a restaurant obsessive \u2013 fascinated by the ecosystems they contain and the quiet dramas unfolding between courses. She interviewed chefs and hospitality managers, read a stack of chef memoirs, watched YouTube videos of kitchens in action \u2013 and, for balance, quite a bit of The Great British Bake Off (the latter more for pleasure). In full Daniel Day-Lewis mode, she even picked up a few waitressing shifts. \u201cThey were sort of a bit bemused, but they were nice about it. I just did what I was told. I think the other waiters were like: Who is this lady? But everyone tolerated me,\u201d Maley says. \u201cPeople open up when you take a real interest in them, their lives, what they want to do, what they have done, the thing they are passionate about, and ask them to explain it to you. People were really giving that way, even though it was a weird ask, and no one really knew what I was doing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite Down and Out in Paris, but the experience gave Maley what she needed: a feel for the choreography, the repetition, the small tensions and quiet triumphs of restaurant life. What surprised her was how much it resembled a newsroom \u2013 fast-paced, hierarchical, and always one dropped order away from chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s a structured environment, but it attracts people who are unstructured in other ways. It\u2019s a little like journalism and a newsroom in that way,\u201d she says. Bill, please! \u201cJournalists are not people who want to work a 9 to 5 job, they\u2019re in for the experience and the adventure. We\u2019re solo operators, but we have to work within an organism, which is the newsroom. Newspapers are very hierarchical, even though we\u2019re all recalcitrant personalities who don\u2019t like being told what to do.\u201d With classic recalcitrance, I break the fourth wall to ask our off-duty journalist if she\u2019s enjoying her turn in the Lunch With hot seat. \u201cAre you checking in?,\u201d Maley jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s going great for me, but am I giving you what you need?\u201d A master of the form, I ask Maley for her Lunch With advice \u2013 she\u2019s got the recipe down, but I\u2019m probably still chopping onions. \u201cJust get them really drunk,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cIt\u2019s quite high pressure, I think. It\u2019s like a social interaction on the surface, but your journalist brain is constantly working. \u201d A pause in proceedings: the main. Pappardelle with stracciatella and truss tomatoes so ripe they look ready to explode on impact. Maley unfolds a paper napkin and tucks it, bib-style, into the relaxed collar of her blue silk shirt. She catches my eye \u2013 the journalist\u2019s brain, even now, still quietly whirring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCan you not put this in the piece?\u201d A pause, a sigh, a smile. \u201cNo, you can, if you want.\u201d The same brain \u2013 always scanning for angles and incoming alerts\u2013 makes it hard for Maley to write fiction while working her day job. Journalism brings a constant overload of information, paired with the nagging sense you\u2019re always missing something important. And while her reporting and novels both circle themes of gender and power, she doesn\u2019t see them as flexing the same muscle. Jacqueline Maley did shifts at a restaurant while she was writing her second novel Lonely Mouth. Credit: Louise Kennerley Her ideal writing conditions are long, uninterrupted stretches away from work, not trying to wedge sentences between school drop-offs, play dates, early dog walks and breaking news alerts. Annual leave became writing leave \u2013 less a break than a change of deadlines. There was also the pressure of following up the success of her first novel and being contracted to a deadline as part of a two-book deal \u2013 a deadline she fell so far behind on that she can\u2019t even precisely remember when it was. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a holiday in years,\u201d Maley says. \u201cSo I ended up, at the end of it, realising it\u2019s quite hard to juggle all of this. It took a toll on me in terms of stress levels, and so that was something that I wouldn\u2019t want to do again. \u201d She\u2019s got ideas bubbling away \u2013 another novel, maybe a non-fiction project \u2013 but for now, she\u2019s letting them simmer. And at least restaurants are just restaurants again, no longer research sites in disguise.\n\nAdvertisement",

Taking an active interest in your health increases your chances of living a long, full life. Credit: Getty Images In your 40s \u201cBy your early 40s, you should have a thorough check-up, including history and a full physical examination,\u201d says Dunne.\n\nCertain regular health screenings should also begin. These include annual blood pressure monitoring from age 40 and STI tests if you are sexually active. Five-yearly blood tests for cholesterol, glucose, cell counts, and nutrition deficiency, as well as bowel cancer screening, should begin at age 45.

Similarly, a physical functioning screening for preventing falls and frailty should also be considered, adds Ding. 70s and beyond In your 70s, on top of existing checks, ensure your immunisations, including tetanus and shingles, are up-to-date, says Dunne. \u201cThere is a funded vaccination program for older Australians, including influenza, COVID, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia,\u201d he says. Gendered screenings\n\nDue to anatomy and physiology, women and men each have unique health risks, which warrant their own specific health screenings. \u201cFor example, whereas women are at risk of cancers of the cervix, ovaries and uterus, men are at risk of prostate cancer,\u201d says Dunne. Breast screening is free for Australian women once they reach 40 years. Women aged 50 to 74 years will receive an invitation for screening from BreastScreen Australia. Credit: Getty Images Gender can also impact their approach to healthcare. \u201cUnlike women, who are often introduced to regular health screenings from a young age, such as pap smears, breast checks, and GP visits for contraception, men typically don\u2019t develop the same routine health-seeking behaviours,\u201d Dunne says.\n\n\u201cThis makes early detection for men especially important, as they are more likely to delay seeking help until symptoms become severe.\u201d Health screenings for men 40 + Men in their 40s should discuss with their GP screening tests for things like prostate cancer, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. \u201cYour GP will consider your individual circumstances, including family history, when recommending when to begin these tests,\u201d says Dunne. Screening tests and regular GP check-ups should continue through your 50s and 60s.\n\nHealth screening for women 40 + Women are going through a lot during their 40s and 50s, says general practitioner Judith Hammond of women\u2019s health clinic, Jean Hailes. \u201cPeri menopause, menopause \u2026 women start to get to that sandwich generation, when they are working, worried about children who need support and supporting elderly parents, life really gets quite crushed around that time,\u201d she says. In this period, it is increasingly important for women to undergo mental health screening, she says. Additionally, regular breast cancer screening via free mammograms can be undertaken from age 40.",

        "text": "Unclear and inconsistent food date labels are contributing significantly to household food waste, according to new research, and it's costing the average family up to $2,500 annually in discarded groceries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study from RMIT University and End Food Waste Australia shows that Australia discards around 7.6 million tonnes of food annually, much of it still safe to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are calling for a national overhaul of food labelling, recommending clearer date markings, larger print, and simple icons to help consumers understand how long food stays safe and how it should be stored.\n\n\n\nProfessor Lukas Parker from RMIT says the research points to poor label design and inconsistent packaging as key factors driving food waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re in a cost-of-living crisis and people are doing their best to feed their families, \" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But they\u2019re being let down by packaging that makes it too hard to make informed decisions. That waste is devastating \u2014 2kg per family per week. It's not just for people\u2019s wallets, but for our farmers and our environment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study suggests small changes in how information is presented, such as clearly distinguishing between \"best before\" and \"use by\" dates, could go a long way in helping shoppers decide whether food is still good to eat.\n\n\n\nWhy current labels aren't working\n\nThe problem, researchers found, is twofold: Australians are confused about the difference between \"use by\" and \"best before\" dates, and they struggle to locate or read those dates on packaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most people understand that 'use by' means the food might not be safe to eat,\" Parker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But 'best before' is murkier. A lot of people throw food away just because it\u2019s past that date, even if it\u2019s still fine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research also highlighted frustration around label location, font size, and formatting, such as dates printed in hard-to-read spots like the crinkled rim of a can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes a lot of effort to find and understand date labels, and that effort makes it harder for people to make the right call,\" Parker said.\n\n\n\nDespite widespread consumer support for clearer labelling, researchers found that the food industry has been hesitant to make changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a series of workshops, food producers and retailers raised concerns about costs, compliance issues and regulatory red tape.\n\n\n\n\n\nTristan Butt, CEO of End Food Waste Australia, said reducing waste through improved labelling will only be possible if all parts of the supply chain work together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Clear, consistent date labelling is one of the most cost-effective and scalable ways to reduce household food waste, but it won\u2019t happen without industry-wide collaboration,\" Butt said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This single change could prevent nearly a million tonnes of food waste by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The UK\u2019s retail sector has already proven this change is possible, without compromising food safety. It\u2019s time we did the same.\"\n\n\n\nIndustry wants direction, government says change is coming\n\nThe workshops revealed that food manufacturers and retailers are hesitant to act alone, fearing that early adopters might face financial or competitive disadvantages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone\u2019s waiting for someone else to go first,\" Parker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government wants industry to take action, and industry wants clearer direction from government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this stalemate, Parker says there\u2019s strong in-principle support for clearer labels across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next phase of the National Date Labelling and Storage Advice Project will bring together government and industry partners to test and co-design clearer labelling.\n\n\n\nLabels should be self-explanatory\n\nThe researchers say clearer design is more important than one-off education campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Good labelling should be so clear it doesn\u2019t need to be explained,\" Parker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Education is great, but it only works if people remember it. Design is what they see every time they pick something up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project will also test consumer reactions using tools like eye-tracking to see how real people interact with packaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s not about making people feel guilty,\" Parker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s about giving them the tools to make confident decisions and keeping good food out of the bin.\"\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the mid-2010s, moviegoers embraced the so-called \u201celevated\u201d horror boom, with films such as The Babadook, Get Out, Midsommar and The Witch at the vanguard \u2013 low-budget, high-concept genre fare that used classic horror tropes to probe contemporary societal ills like toxic relationships, racism and mental illness. (The \u201celevated\u201d label was a bit of clever rebranding, like slapping an \u201corganic\u201d sticker on a hamburger; these movies function the same way great horror always has \u2013 you just feel a little less dirty about enjoying them.) Now it seems it\u2019s literature\u2019s turn. In 2023, there was a record number of new horror books both published and sold, and two years on, the trend shows little sign of slowing. Literary agents are reporting submission piles filling up with more tales of the weird and eerie, from eco-horror to folk horror to the aptly named \u201cfemgore\u201d \u2013 hyper-violent, female-centric body horror. In the last year alone \u2013 and this is but a tiny sliver of what\u2019s on offer \u2013 we\u2019ve had Gretchen Felker-Martin\u2019s Cuckoo, which made the very real horrors of gay conversion camps manifest in a grotesque body-snatching teen epic. Rachel Harrison\u2019s So Thirsty took a big, bloody bite out of 21st-century female friendship with its ultra-gory vampire antics. The Lamb, Lucy Rose\u2019s fairytale debut, told the touching story a young girl caring for her mother \u2026 by bringing her stray hikers to satiate her cannibalistic urge for human flesh (pair it with Monika Kim\u2019s The Eyes are the Best Part for a stomach-churning family-sized feast). And 50 years after the publication of his first novel, Carrie, horror stalwart Stephen King released his latest short story anthology You Like It Darker (just months after a brand-new novel, Holly \u2013 also featuring cannibals). The late horror director George A. Romero, whose horror novel has been \u2013 fittingly \u2013 published posthumously. Credit: AP King isn\u2019t the only elder statesman jostling for shelf space alongside the BookTok generation. George A. Romero, the man responsible for our modern conception of zombies, with films like The Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, released his final novel earlier this year, somewhat fittingly from beyond the grave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-written by Daniel Kraus, who discovered the incomplete manuscript in an archive box at the University of Pittsburgh Library in 2019, Pay the Piper is a sweaty, cosmic eco-horror set in the muggy depths of the Louisiana bayou, where a nine-year-old girl named Pontiac and a rag-tag group of townsfolk from her home of Alligator Point come up against an ancient, vengeful evil that\u2019s been lurking in the swamp and preying on children. While Romero will forever be remembered primarily as an orchestrator of gnarly kills and ground-breaking special effects, his zombie movies always had more than merely brains on the brain. His seminal Night of the Living Dead is often read as a critique of racial tensions in 1960s America; it features a Black protagonist (played by Duane Jones) who survives an undead horde only to be shot by a white sheriff. The 1978 follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, set entirely in a shopping mall, can only be seen as a satirical indictment of rampant consumerism. Pay the Piper continues this tradition of smuggling hefty themes into seemingly straightforward horror schtick. Young Pontiac\u2019s home is under threat from a nefarious character known only as The Oil Man \u2013 a phantom-like stand-in for the entire fossil fuel industry \u2013 as well as The Piper itself, an aquatic Lovecraftian creature seeking restitution for the thousands of slaves slaughtered and dumped in its waters by the infamous Pirates Lafitte in the 1800s. Romero and Kraus\u2019 book mutates from gooey Southern Gothic to a full-throated treatise on human cruelty and environmental calamity; it\u2019s spooky, stirring Cajun cli-fi with a healthy dose of tentacles. YA author Margot McGovern has long been a fan of slasher and horror films. Closer to home, this March saw the release of Margot McGovern\u2019s riveting supernatural YA slasher This Stays Between Us. McGovern\u2019s second book boasts a little bit of everything: early 2000s nostalgia, late-night seances, teenage crushes, buried secrets and a predatory entity known only as Smiling Jack that hunts its four young female protagonists as they try to survive year 11 camp in a remote, abandoned mining town. McGovern\u2019s first book, Neverland, released in 2018, hewed much closer to magical realism \u2013 but a life-long love of horror helped inspire her sophomore stab. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a huge horror fan,\u201d says McGovern. \u201cI read and watched a lot growing up, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of Australian horror at that time. Most of the movies came from the US. And with horror books, in the \u201990s it felt like you had R.L. Stine and then there was this huge gap before you jumped to Stephen King and Clive Barker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeen horror films filled that gap for McGovern. \u201cI always knew I wanted to write a book that was set here in Australia and evoked the Australian landscape and personality, but embodied all the fun of a late-90s slasher,\u201d she says. \u201cKevin Williamson\u2019s screenplays were a huge influence on me. I love Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and Teaching Mrs. Tingle \u2013 even movies like The Craft.\u201d A scene from classic 90s slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. Credit: Amazon Prime Of course, the defining feature of all these movies \u2013 and many of the books already mentioned \u2013 is teenagers. In horror, teens are often the heroes, the hapless victims and the target audience all at once. \u201cHorror occupies this really interesting liminal space for teenagers,\u201d McGovern says of her passion for writing YA. \u201cIt gives you that last little bit of make-believe. \u201cIt offers a step up into the adult world, where things can be genuinely terrifying and violent. When you\u2019re 13 or 14, you feel like things are out of your control \u2013 you\u2019re going through this huge transition, you\u2019re figuring out who you are, your body\u2019s changing, all the rules are changing! \u2013 and horror not only explores that, but gives you a way to take back some power and agency.\u201d Perhaps that explains our present-day horror boom, then. We\u2019re all of us teenagers in a world that feels increasingly out of control \u2013 but instead of regressing into childhood and escaping into all-out fantasy, we\u2019re ready to confront our fears; to look the monster under the bed, or the creature in the swamp, or the thing in the mirror dead in the eye. \u201cHorror has always responded to what\u2019s happening in the culture,\u201d McGovern says. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s making such a comeback now. In times of uncertainty and upheaval, horror offers a set of familiar tropes that lets you approach your darkest fears in an almost comforting way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "But to hear Elon Musk tell it, his Starship and its successors will soon be the workhorses of an interplanetary fleet that will take humans to Mars. And not just a few intrepid Apollo-style explorers collecting rocks and taking pictures, mind you. Musk and his disciples want to colonise the red planet, and by that, he means setting up an entire, self-sufficient civilisation there.\n\nAsk a deckhand on a fishing trawler in the Gulf of Mexico what he saw, when yet another doomed Space X Starship detonated 10 kilometres above his head, and these are not words he would use.\n\nIn commercial space flight PR jargon, a catastrophic launch failure is routinely glossed over with seemingly innocuous explanations. The second stage booster did not \u201cexplode, destroying millions of dollars\u2019 worth of engines and several satellites\u201d. No, it \u201cunderwent a rapid unplanned disassembly\u201d, the results of which were \u201cmission sub-optimal\u201d.\n\nAdam Becker\u2019s marvellous \u201cdisassembly\u201d of Musk\u2019s ludicrous fantasy is neither unplanned nor sub-optimal. Subtitled AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley\u2019s Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity, More Everything Forever gives a trawler deckhand\u2019s eye view of what awaits us, should a deluded cabal of tech billionaires somehow make their dreams come true.\n\nElon Musk brandishing a chainsaw at a pro-Trump conference earlier this year. Credit: AP\n\nThe paving stones of these roads to hell are, seductively as ever, presented by advocates as nothing more sinister than the greatest good for the greatest number, and history is littered with the wreckage of such beneficent intentions.\n\nAnd so it is that Becker begins his descent into the AI underworld in the seemingly harmless realm of EA, or \u201ceffective altruism\u201d; the notion that it is incumbent on people with wealth to share it around, and so help those less fortunate. The catch here is the E before the A, and what began as a fairly harmless, if occasionally wacky, crusade in the minds of philosophers like Peter Singer can, and did, come utterly unhinged when the brutal logic of algorithms is used to maximise the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of altruism. Particularly in the hands of the likes of cryptocurrency lunatics such as Sam Bankman-Fried, and the deluded Scottish philosopher William MacAskill.\n\nBankman-Fried was very keen on EA, and he did give away a lot of money, but as most of it belonged to other people, he was convicted of fraud on a titanic scale in 2023 and consigned to the hoosegow for 25 years. But 25 years is a millisecond to MacAskill, an advocate of \u201clongtermism\u201d, a clumsy word which means that in order to ensure the greatest good for the greatest number, it\u2019s clear (to longtermists, anyway) that we need a lot more people to make happy. More people, indeed, than Earth\u2019s ecology could ever support.",

        "text": "Others, conscious that the US relies on foreign capital inflows to fund its yawning (and rapidly growing) government deficits and debt and enable the government and US citizens to live beyond their means, won\u2019t view the apparent crack in the value of the dollar and the US markets\u2019 status as the world\u2019s safe haven quite as positively. In the near term, the weaker US dollar also means the inflationary impacts in the US of Trump\u2019s trade war on the rest of the world will be exaggerated. A strong dollar, by making imports cheap in US dollar term, would muffle the impact on inflation. \u2018European leaders have recognised the window of opportunity opened by America\u2019s self-destructive trade policies.\u2019 The likely effects of Trump\u2019s war is reflected in this week\u2019s downgrading of the outlook for global and US growth by the World Bank, which sees global growth slowing from 2.8 per cent last year to 2.3 per cent and growth in the US economy halving from 2.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent. That outlook, if it eventuates, would provide even less reason to invest in the US and would result in an even greater reduction in demand for US dollars.\n\nDoes that provide an opportunity for the euro? Perhaps, albeit not one that could be easily or quickly realised. The dollar has reined supreme as the world\u2019s reserve currency in the post-war era and still does. Even though the degree of dominance has been waning in recent years, it still accounts for about 58 per cent of central bank reserves \u2013 it was above 70 per cent in the early years of this century and was still above 60 per cent five years ago \u2013 and about 55 per cent of trade invoicing is denominated in dollars. The US dollar has depreciated about 10 per cent this year. Credit: Bloomberg The euro ranks second on both counts, with a 30 per cent or so share of reserves and a similar share of trade financing.\n\nThe challenge for the Europeans, if they want to challenge the dollar\u2019s status, is that, while they might have the \u201cnext best\u201d currency, they lack some of the foundations that would make it the reserve currency. Loading They do have a floating exchange rate, no capital controls, an independent and respected central bank and an independent and respected judicial system. They don\u2019t have deep and liquid capital markets nor a single economy that is growing consistently and strongly, nor do they have current account deficits to expand the supply of euros \u2013 the European Union consistently runs current account surpluses (and hence is a major target for Trump\u2019s tariffs). The European capital markets are fragmented and shallow \u2013 European companies rely on banks rather than markets as their primary source of funding \u2013 and the condition of the underlying economies varies considerably.\n\nThe closest thing the EU has to a US Treasury bond is a Germany bund but, where the US Treasury market has about $US28 trillion ($43 trillion) of securities on issue, the market for bunds is only about \u20ac1.8 trillion (about $3.2 trillion). That market, thanks to the historic decision to reform the country\u2019s \u201cdebt brake\u201d in order to use debt-financing for what might be a \u20ac600 billion increase in military spending, will grow, but it would still remain small relative to the Treasury market. Loading What could the EU do to create a deeper bond market? It could issue eurobonds, or debt raised on behalf of all its members and backed by all their economies. It has toyed with that idea for decades and, indeed, created a eurobond facility of up to \u20ac800 billion to help member countries recover from the pandemic, although those bonds are supposed to progressively mature and disappear by 2058.\n\nGermany has historically been opposed to the issuance of collective EU debt. It\u2019s strict fiscal discipline means it can borrow more cheaply than other EU members and pay lower interest rates on its debt. With eurobonds, it would pay more and effectively be subsidising the rest of the EU. The prize for the EU as a whole \u2013 a greater share of world reserves, a more stable currency in stressful times, cheaper funding generally and therefore greater economic growth and the geopolitical benefits from having a reserve currency \u2013 is, however, worth striving for. The EU could do more trade in euros \u2013 it buys a lot of energy but pays for it almost exclusively in US dollars, for instance \u2013 it could issue a digital euro to facilitate global transactions, and it could integrate its economies and policies more deeply. While the Europeans have the \u201cnext best\u201d currency, they lack some of the foundations that would make it THE reserve currency. Credit: AP It could also do as the US Federal Reserve Board has done in financial crises, and create permanent swap lines with its major trading partners to provide euro liquidity in moment of stress. That would bolster confidence in the currency.\n\nIt is improbable that the euro could displace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency in anything other than the truly long term. Loading It could, however, increase its share of global reserves and transactions and share some of the dollar\u2019s \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d \u2013 the ability to borrow cheaply without any real limits, the haven status in a crisis, the ability, if they ever transpired, to run trade deficits without any fear of a balance of payments crisis, and, above all, the enhanced geopolitical authority the EU has always sought. European leaders have recognised the window of opportunity opened by America\u2019s self-destructive trade policies \u2013 it\u2019s been a growing topic of conversation in Europe since Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement \u2013 but have also acknowledged the complexities and obstacles to taking advantage of it. Still, small but important steps could be taken, with eurobond issuance at the forefront and, with the EU members committed to ramping up their defence spending in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, this could be an instance where, thanks to Trump and Vladimir Putin, opportunity and need start to converge.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Lunch begins with an editorial intervention. \u201cI want to say, for the record,\u201d Jacqueline Maley \u2013 ever the journalist \u2013 announces. \u201cThat this was on my vision board before Tay Tay came. I was so on the zeitgeist.\u201d We\u2019re dining at Pellegrino 2000, tucked inside a historic terrace in Surry Hills, where the vibe is old-school Italian with a wink. Chianti bottles sit like trophies, tomato tins masquerade as rustic decor, and ropes of dried herbs and spices dangle above the bar. An eccentric collection of framed artwork lines the walls \u2013 including an image of the Michelin Man, beaming over the room like an ironic deity, blessing the carb-loading faithful below. It\u2019s theatrical, yet charming. The perfect setting for a pop star \u2013 or, in Maley\u2019s case, her second novel, Lonely Mouth. Long before Taylor Swift and her gal pal Sabrina Carpenter turned the restaurant into pop culture real estate when they spent the first night of their Eras and Sydney Zoo tour here, Maley was already a regular. She started visiting for the relaxed refinement and crema caramello alla banana (accompanied, no hyperbole, by an entire plate of cream!), but she kept visiting once she realised Pellegrino 2000 also served up perfect inspiration for a novel. Lunch with journalist and novelist Jacqueline Maley Credit: Steven Siewert \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite Sydney restaurants,\u201d Maley says. \u201cThe restaurant I had in mind for the novel was elegant and cool, but it was never going to try too hard or be like a white tablecloth place. I love good food, but I hate any stuffy atmosphere.\u201d Maley would sit at the bar, sketching details in a notepad, absorbing the restaurant\u2019s textures and rhythms. In Lonely Mouth, Pellegrino 2000 becomes the inspiration for the fictional Bocca \u2013 an Italian restaurant with a Japanese twist and a trattoria-meets\u2013art deco aesthetic, located in Darlinghurst. Her narrator, Matilda, works there as the manager: a sharp and solitary 30-something nursing an unrequited crush on the restaurant\u2019s bad-boy owner, Colson, and quietly shouldering the aftershocks of her mother leaving her and her sister, Lara, when they were children (made doubly traumatic by the fact it happened outside the Big Merino rest stop at Goulburn, off the Hume Highway). As a menu reduces a sauce, so too does a plot summary flatten Lonely Mouth. It\u2019s a novel, rich with humour and sharp observations, about desire \u2013 for food, for love, for life \u2013 and what happens when that desire gets swallowed. It\u2019s about sisters, and mothers and daughters. And Bocca becomes more than a backdrop: it\u2019s a space where chaos meets order, appetite meets discipline, and everyone\u2019s slightly hungry for something they can\u2019t quite name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to set the novel in a restaurant. I thought it would be a dynamic setting,\u201d Maley says. \u201cI wanted it to be very realistic. I really wanted the restaurant to be like a character in the book, to be so atmospheric, it would take people there.\u201d Caponata di melanzane: Eggplant, tomato, pine nuts and pickled celery. Credit: Steven Siewert How many times did she visit Pellegrino 2000? \u201cYou should ask my accountant when I put through my next tax return,\u201d Maley quips. Mercifully, we avoid the worst part of Lunch Withs \u2013 the stilted pas de deux over the menu, the self-consciousness of wondering if one\u2019s contributions to the ordering are too much, too little, too indulgent, too virtuous. Maley takes full control, like someone who has asked far tougher questions than \u201cshared plates or mains\u201d? To start, we opt for a pillowy focaccia and truffle-parmesan, an unexpectedly punchy caponata due to pickled celery, and a lush buffalo mozzarella, adorned with figs and honey. The wine stays on theme \u2013 a glass of Italian Pinot Grigio and a sharp Catarratto. Photographer Steven Siewert hovers nearby like a set designer reworking a diorama \u2013 moving errant phones out of frames, opening blinds for better light, repositioning cutlery with surgical precision. Pappardelle al pomodoro: Pappardelle, truss tomatoes and stracciatella. Credit: Steven Siewert \u201cIt is weird to be on the receiving end of what we usually do to other people,\u201d Maley says. She has a deadline for her own Lunch With interview, with a senior public figure, looming. After completing an arts law degree, Maley started at The Sydney Morning Herald as a cadet in 2003. She comes from media stock: her mother, Judy, to whom Lonely Mouth is dedicated, worked at the Herald; her great-grandfather and great-uncle were political journalists; and her brother, Paul, was a reporter at The Australian. Maley\u2019s a senior writer, columnist, podcast host and newsletter editor and, today, the unfortunate soul sitting on the wrong side of the notepad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, Maley\u2019s not entirely unprepared. This isn\u2019t our first time at the Lunch With table together. When her debut novel, The Truth About Her, came out in 2021, we met for breakfast in a courtyard of a cafe that was a little more toast crumbs than terrazzo tables. Now look at us: dining in a hot spot frequented by actual celebrities. For everyone\u2019s sake, I suggest Maley consider setting her next novel in a five-star resort. Jacqueline Maley\u2019s second novel Lonely Mouth is largely set in a restaurant. \u201cWe\u2019re cosmopolitan ladies of the world now,\u201d Maley retorts. \u201cI think we need to really level up. I\u2019m thinking ... Denmark. What\u2019s that place? Noma.\u201d The three-Michelin-star restaurant serves 20-course meals and regularly tops lists of the best restaurants in the world. For Lonely Mouth, Maley became something of a restaurant obsessive \u2013 fascinated by the ecosystems they contain and the quiet dramas unfolding between courses. She interviewed chefs and hospitality managers, read a stack of chef memoirs, watched YouTube videos of kitchens in action \u2013 and, for balance, quite a bit of The Great British Bake Off (the latter more for pleasure). In full Daniel Day-Lewis mode, she even picked up a few waitressing shifts. \u201cThey were sort of a bit bemused, but they were nice about it. I just did what I was told. I think the other waiters were like: Who is this lady? But everyone tolerated me,\u201d Maley says. \u201cPeople open up when you take a real interest in them, their lives, what they want to do, what they have done, the thing they are passionate about, and ask them to explain it to you. People were really giving that way, even though it was a weird ask, and no one really knew what I was doing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite Down and Out in Paris, but the experience gave Maley what she needed: a feel for the choreography, the repetition, the small tensions and quiet triumphs of restaurant life. What surprised her was how much it resembled a newsroom \u2013 fast-paced, hierarchical, and always one dropped order away from chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s a structured environment, but it attracts people who are unstructured in other ways. It\u2019s a little like journalism and a newsroom in that way,\u201d she says. Bill, please! \u201cJournalists are not people who want to work a 9 to 5 job, they\u2019re in for the experience and the adventure. We\u2019re solo operators, but we have to work within an organism, which is the newsroom. Newspapers are very hierarchical, even though we\u2019re all recalcitrant personalities who don\u2019t like being told what to do.\u201d With classic recalcitrance, I break the fourth wall to ask our off-duty journalist if she\u2019s enjoying her turn in the Lunch With hot seat. \u201cAre you checking in?,\u201d Maley jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s going great for me, but am I giving you what you need?\u201d A master of the form, I ask Maley for her Lunch With advice \u2013 she\u2019s got the recipe down, but I\u2019m probably still chopping onions. \u201cJust get them really drunk,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cIt\u2019s quite high pressure, I think. It\u2019s like a social interaction on the surface, but your journalist brain is constantly working. \u201d A pause in proceedings: the main. Pappardelle with stracciatella and truss tomatoes so ripe they look ready to explode on impact. Maley unfolds a paper napkin and tucks it, bib-style, into the relaxed collar of her blue silk shirt. She catches my eye \u2013 the journalist\u2019s brain, even now, still quietly whirring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCan you not put this in the piece?\u201d A pause, a sigh, a smile. \u201cNo, you can, if you want.\u201d The same brain \u2013 always scanning for angles and incoming alerts\u2013 makes it hard for Maley to write fiction while working her day job. Journalism brings a constant overload of information, paired with the nagging sense you\u2019re always missing something important. And while her reporting and novels both circle themes of gender and power, she doesn\u2019t see them as flexing the same muscle. Jacqueline Maley did shifts at a restaurant while she was writing her second novel Lonely Mouth. Credit: Louise Kennerley Her ideal writing conditions are long, uninterrupted stretches away from work, not trying to wedge sentences between school drop-offs, play dates, early dog walks and breaking news alerts. Annual leave became writing leave \u2013 less a break than a change of deadlines. There was also the pressure of following up the success of her first novel and being contracted to a deadline as part of a two-book deal \u2013 a deadline she fell so far behind on that she can\u2019t even precisely remember when it was. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a holiday in years,\u201d Maley says. \u201cSo I ended up, at the end of it, realising it\u2019s quite hard to juggle all of this. It took a toll on me in terms of stress levels, and so that was something that I wouldn\u2019t want to do again. \u201d She\u2019s got ideas bubbling away \u2013 another novel, maybe a non-fiction project \u2013 but for now, she\u2019s letting them simmer. And at least restaurants are just restaurants again, no longer research sites in disguise.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "While there is no one-size-fits-all approach for preventative health checks, individual factors\u2013 including family or personal medical history, gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle \u2013 influence which tests a person should undertake, as well as when to begin them and the frequency at which they are performed. However, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) does recommend certain health screens for the general population at each decade of life. Taking an active interest in your health increases your chances of living a long, full life. Credit: Getty Images In your 40s \u201cBy your early 40s, you should have a thorough check-up, including history and a full physical examination,\u201d says Dunne.\n\nCertain regular health screenings should also begin. These include annual blood pressure monitoring from age 40 and STI tests if you are sexually active. Five-yearly blood tests for cholesterol, glucose, cell counts, and nutrition deficiency, as well as bowel cancer screening, should begin at age 45. Loading Skin cancer checks are recommended due to the increased risk with age, and due to a trend of increasing colon cancer in people under age 50, the Australian government has recently changed the starting age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45, says Ding. In your 50s\n\nNatasha Yates, assistant professor of general practice at Bond University, says that people in their 50s should continue all the health screenings from their 40s, with the addition of some others. \u201cAdd a bone health assessment and consider screening for osteoporosis, especially if risk factors are present,\u201d she says. \u201cVision and hearing tests to detect age-related changes are also recommended.\u201d Yates says the National Lung Cancer Screening Program is due to commence in July this year. It will offer two-yearly low-dose CT scans to detect lung cancer in asymptomatic patients aged 50 to 70 who are deemed to be at high risk from smoking, she says. In your 60s\n\nIn addition to existing screenings, Yates says that a cognitive function evaluation, which assesses for signs of cognitive decline or dementia, should be undertaken. Similarly, a physical functioning screening for preventing falls and frailty should also be considered, adds Ding. 70s and beyond In your 70s, on top of existing checks, ensure your immunisations, including tetanus and shingles, are up-to-date, says Dunne. \u201cThere is a funded vaccination program for older Australians, including influenza, COVID, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia,\u201d he says. Gendered screenings\n\nDue to anatomy and physiology, women and men each have unique health risks, which warrant their own specific health screenings. \u201cFor example, whereas women are at risk of cancers of the cervix, ovaries and uterus, men are at risk of prostate cancer,\u201d says Dunne. Breast screening is free for Australian women once they reach 40 years. Women aged 50 to 74 years will receive an invitation for screening from BreastScreen Australia. Credit: Getty Images Gender can also impact their approach to healthcare. \u201cUnlike women, who are often introduced to regular health screenings from a young age, such as pap smears, breast checks, and GP visits for contraception, men typically don\u2019t develop the same routine health-seeking behaviours,\u201d Dunne says.\n\n\u201cThis makes early detection for men especially important, as they are more likely to delay seeking help until symptoms become severe.\u201d Health screenings for men 40 + Men in their 40s should discuss with their GP screening tests for things like prostate cancer, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. \u201cYour GP will consider your individual circumstances, including family history, when recommending when to begin these tests,\u201d says Dunne. Screening tests and regular GP check-ups should continue through your 50s and 60s.\n\nHealth screening for women 40 + Women are going through a lot during their 40s and 50s, says general practitioner Judith Hammond of women\u2019s health clinic, Jean Hailes. \u201cPeri menopause, menopause \u2026 women start to get to that sandwich generation, when they are working, worried about children who need support and supporting elderly parents, life really gets quite crushed around that time,\u201d she says. In this period, it is increasingly important for women to undergo mental health screening, she says. Additionally, regular breast cancer screening via free mammograms can be undertaken from age 40.",

        "text": "Australia is miles behind China when it comes to adopting electric cars \u2013 and it means our cities are a lot louder.\n\nA Chinese city is completely silent despite cars and motorbikes on the roads. Source: TikTok/TheForeignerLIfe\n\nWhen visiting any city with a large population, most travellers would expect to jump off public transport and instantly be hit with a barrage of sights and sounds. However, one US expat living in China has revealed the incredible \u2013 and quite different \u2013 reality emerging in the county while on a recent visit to a neighbouring city.\n\nUS citizen Garrett took a trip to the city of Suzhou, about an hour from his home in Shanghai. Arriving there, he was left astounded while standing beside the road because, despite cars and motorbikes zooming past, there was virtually no traffic noise.\n\n\"Quite a busy intersection but super quiet,\" he told Yahoo News of the surprising moment, which highlights just how successful the uptake of electric vehicles has been in the Asian economic powerhouse.\n\n\"The silence on the streets is fantastic; even in a city of 30 million people, the streets are incredibly calm,\" he said.\n\nElectric car driving 'just normal' in China\n\nFor Garrett, he's seen firsthand that it's hard for Westerners to understand why this has happened.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"As I have seen in China, sustainability isn\u2019t political at all; it\u2019s a widely acknowledged necessity for the planet and for economics,\" he said, explaining that EV-driving \"isn't cool, it's just normal\".\n\nIn 2024, China sold nearly 13 million fully electric and hybrid vehicles, meaning EVs accounted for 40 per cent of total sales in the Chinese market.\n\nThe number of sales is four times as many as the United States. In Australia, that figure was just 114,000 in the same time frame, according to the Electric Vehicle Council.\n\nAustralians are continuing to buy more electric vehicles than ever before, according to recent sales records. But traditional brands like Toyota and Ford still dominate new car sales, with Toyota topping the charts for an incredible 23 years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGarrett said his Chinese colleagues are more surprised to hear that someone doesn't drive an EV.\n\n\"Many of my colleagues have EVs, and when I pointed that out, they responded with \u2018oh, yeah, don\u2019t you drive one?\u2019,\" he said.\n\n\"In my view, I think it\u2019s because people don\u2019t seem to politicise sustainability.\"\n\nThis was laid bare as US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk exchanged in a very public back-and-forth earlier this week, signalling their relationship may well be over.\n\nThe Tesla boss criticised the president's 'Big Beautiful Bill' aimed to fast-track policy around spending, revenue and the debt ceiling, which would see electric vehicle subsidies scrapped in the US.\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe America will get to the level China is at ever without significant political change,\" Garrett said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"And as America is a very individualistic culture, it will be very hard to sell the public on the benefit to the greater society. Most people I know in China just say \u2018Well, driving EVs is better for everyone and the government supports that'.\"\n\nThe Chinese EV giant is rolling out the world's largest roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) carriers to send cars around the world. Source: BYD\n\nChina leading electric vehicle market around the world\n\nChina is leading the way with EV uptake largely due to government support through subsidies and tax breaks. Licence plates for regular cars with internal combustion engines face long waits and high costs to get the plates, but for EVs it's free.\n\nHomegrown support has helped Chinese automakers expand across the world, with countless new models hitting the market in Australia and worldwide seemingly every month.\n\nBYD took the world by storm when photos of its fleet of car carriers recently emerged. The brand, commonly seen on Aussie roads, is moving with \"unprecedented speed\" to overtake US rival Tesla as the global leader in electric vehicles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCar expert Paul Maric recently returned from the Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition, where Chinese car brands displayed their latest innovations.\n\n\"China is on another level entirely,\" he told Yahoo News recently.\n\n\"Anyone in Australia who thinks they\u2019re just going to go away sometime soon is in for a shock.\n\n\"I think eventually it will just lead to cars becoming more affordable,\" he said of the growing expansion of the Chinese industry.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Families caravanning their way around the country may look like they're living the dream, but there is one dirty task which left this dad gagging.\n\nThere are plenty of things to love about caravaning around Australia. The vast landscapes, incredible sunsets, awe-inspiring wildlife and wide open spaces are just a few of the reasons why so many people are quitting their jobs, selling their houses and hitting the open road.\n\nBut just like life back home, there are jobs that you don't want to do. One such task in the caravanning world is emptying what's affectionately known as the \"devil's suitcase\". When the caravan toilet is filled with waste, it must be emptied at a designated dump point.\n\nBut it doesn't always go to plan, with regular instances of the dirty task going awry. One caravanning dad learnt the hard way just how wrong it can go when he dropped the lid down the dump point into piles of human waste below.\n\nWhile some may simply accept their fate and give up on the lost item, determined dad Ashley Moy, who was staying in Alice Springs with his family at the time, told Yahoo News it was too \"important\" to leave behind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"If you don't have the cap, you run the real risk of your waste sloshing out of the cassette,\" he said, describing that scenario as \"yuck\".\n\nHow did caravan dad lose cassette toilet lid?\n\nAshley told Yahoo the family of five, who are doing a 12-month lap of the country, had just arrived in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory when they realised their caravan toilet needed emptying. He sarcastically said it's a \"very common but enjoyable chore\" all caravanners must undertake.\n\n\"We found the local toilet dump site and began emptying out the waste from inside the casette,\" he said. \"The casette has a great lid that screws onto the casette, you unscrew the lid when emptying it.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen he was finished, he packed away the hose used to clean out the cassette, and \"knocked the cap into the dump point hole\" and into the septic tank down below.\n\nArmed with a pair of tongs, the Aussie dad attempted what many would simply refuse to do and put his hand down the dump point. In a clip shared online, the dad is seen gagging while his wife Rachel cackles in the background as she films.\n\nIncredibly, after gagging a few times, the dad manages to get the cap out of the septic tank by putting his entire arm down the dump point hole.\n\nSome viewers described the scene as their \"worst nightmare\".\n\n\"I'm dry heaving just watching this, I can\u2019t imagine doing it,\" said another.\n\nLuckily, the dad was able to retrieve the item and avoided the risk of human waste sloshing around in his caravan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut if you're wondering what happened to the tongs after the deed was done, Ashely said: \"Let's leave the tongs up to people's imagination\".\n\nDo you have a story tip?
