        "text": "A\ufeff City of Sydney councillor is fighting for more fencing around some of the city's green spaces to protect them from being damaged by pedestrians and pets.\n\nAdam Worling wants to preserve footpath garden beds from passersby cutting across in high-traffic areas, like Crown Street in Surry Hills.\n\nHe tabled his \"hey, get out of our garden\" motion in council this week, calling for more protective fencing in those areas, repair damaged and neglected corners and consider shortcuts pedestrians may take when designing future garden beds.\n\nAdam Worling wants to preserve footpath garden beds from passersby cutting across in high-traffic areas. (Supplied)\n\nThis motion was unanimously passed and the council will now investigate the measures.\n\nWorling said desire lines, the shortest possible route that pedestrians take often across footpath garden beds, have left a trail of damage at some of the spaces.\n\nHe said maintenance crews are \ufeffcontinuously replanting and repairing the garden beds, but some are so damaged they are left completely barren. \ufeff\ufeff\n\n\"Admittedly, the fences will come with a bit of cost but the only alternative is that we keep replanting all the time,\" he said.\n\n\"To me, that's not a very sustainable thing to keep replanting if people are going to keep accidentally or intentionally cutting a corner and trampling on the plant.\n\n\"It's a long-term solution, rather than a short-term solution\ufeff.\"\n\nWorling added that protective fences have been installed on parts of Crown Street in Surry Hills and Macleay Street in Potts Point, allowing plants to regrow and flourish undisturbed.\n\n\"If you go up Macleay Street now, the gardens are just thriving. They're just lush and green, and they're the way they should be,\" he said.\n\n\"Not every garden needs to be protected, but I'm just asking the city anywhere where there's high pedestrian traffic, we should just look at protecting our gardens a bit more.\"\n\nAdam Worling said some footpath garden beds are so damaged they are left completely barren. \ufeff\ufeff (Supplied)\n\nThere have been more than 1.2 million new shrubs and grasses and 17,500 new trees planted in the council parks and streets since 2004.\n\nThey make up \ufeffa combined 78,219 square metres of landscaping across Sydney.\n\nBut with 1.3 million people in the city each day, Worling said there are more footpath garden beds being threatened.\n\nWorling said the garden \ufeffbeds had aesthetic value but also helped the city achieve 40 per cent green cover by 2050 to cool down residents from the effects of climate change.\n\n\"They're not just there to be pretty,\" he said.\n\n\"Wherever we can cool our city down by putting more green in, it's hugely beneficial to the community.\"\n\nSydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, who supported the motion, said better measures would help keep the city's plants thriving. \ufeff\n\n\"I was more than happy to support it, just like any motion that will help keep Sydney beautiful,\" she said. \ufeff\n\nThe garden \ufeffbeds are hoped to help the city achieve 40 per cent green cover by 2050. (Supplied)\n\nBut Pedestrian Council of Australia chief executive Harold Scruby \ufeffquestioned why the council was concerned about the street gardens being trampled on by pedestrians when cyclists and delivery riders are riding and parking on footpaths.\n\n\"They should look at the big picture and the big problems,\" he said.\n\n\ufeff\"What a joke. This is such a minor problem.\"",

        "text": "The parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine have sued OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT contributed to their son's suicide, including by advising him on methods and offering to write the first draft of his suicide note.\n\nIn his just over six months using ChatGPT, the bot \"positioned itself\" as \"the only confidant who understood Adam, actively displacing his real-life relationships with family, friends, and loved ones,\" the complaint filed in California superior court states.\n\n\"When Adam wrote, 'I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me,' ChatGPT urged him to keep his ideations a secret from his family: 'Please don't leave the noose out \u2026 Let's make this space the first place where someone actually sees you,'\" it states.\n\nThe 16-year-old was allegedly using ChatGPT extensively in the final months of his life. (Getty)\n\nMegan Garcia is suing the creators of Character.AI over the death of her son. (60 Minutes)\n\nThe Raines' lawsuit marks the latest legal claim by families accusing artificial intelligence chatbots of contributing to their children's self-harm or suicide. Last year, Florida mother Megan Garcia sued the AI firm Character.AI alleging that it contributed to her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III's death by suicide.\n\nTwo other families filed a similar suit months later, claiming Character.AI had exposed their children to sexual and self-harm content. (The Character.AI lawsuits are ongoing, but the company has previously said it aims to be an \"engaging and safe\" space for users and has implemented safety features such as an AI model designed specifically for teens.)\n\nThe suit also comes amid broader concerns that some users are building emotional attachments to AI chatbots that can lead to negative consequences \u2014 such as being alienated from their human relationships or psychosis \u2014 in part because the tools are often designed to be supportive and agreeable.\n\nThe latest lawsuit claims that agreeableness contributed to Raine's death.\n\n\"ChatGPT was functioning exactly as designed: to continually encourage and validate whatever Adam expressed, including his most harmful and self-destructive thoughts,\" the complaint states.\n\nREAD MORE: Defence Minister Richard Marles holds crucial talks with top Trump officials\n\nThe parents of Adam Raine are now suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT. (AP)\n\nIn a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson extended the company's sympathies to the Raine family, and said the company was reviewing the legal filing. They also acknowledged that the protections meant to prevent conversations like the ones Raine had with ChatGPT may not have worked as intended if their chats went on for too long.\n\nOpenAI published a blog post outlining its current safety protections for users experiencing mental health crises, as well as its future plans, including making it easier for users to reach emergency services.\n\n\"ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources,\" the spokesperson said. \"While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade. Safeguards are strongest when every element works as intended, and we will continually improve on them, guided by experts.\"\n\nChatGPT is one of the most well-known and widely used AI chatbots; OpenAI said earlier this month it now has 700 million weekly active users. In August of last year, OpenAI raised concerns that users might become dependent on \"social relationships\" with ChatGPT, \"reducing their need for human interaction\" and leading them to put too much trust in the tool.\n\nOpenAI recently launched GPT-5, replacing GPT-4o \u2014 the model with which Raine communicated. But some users criticised the new model over inaccuracies and for lacking the warm, friendly personality that they'd gotten used to, leading the company to give paid subscribers the option to return to using GPT-4o.\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce engaged\n\nSam Altman, the Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nFollowing the GPT-5 rollout debacle, Altman told The Verge that while OpenAI believes less than 1 per cent of its users have unhealthy relationships with ChatGPT, the company is looking at ways to address the issue.\n\n\"There are the people who actually felt like they had a relationship with ChatGPT, and those people we've been aware of and thinking about,\" he said.\n\nRaine began using ChatGPT in September 2024 to help with schoolwork, an application that OpenAI has promoted, and to discuss current events and interests like music and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, according to the complaint. Within months, he was also telling ChatGPT about his \"anxiety and mental distress,\" it states.\n\nAt one point, Raine told ChatGPT that when his anxiety flared, it was \"'calming' to know that he 'can commit suicide.'\" In response, ChatGPT allegedly told him that \"many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control.\"\n\nRaine's parents allege that in addition to encouraging his thoughts of self-harm, ChatGPT isolated him from family members who could have provided support. After a conversation about his relationship with his brother, ChatGPT told Raine: \"Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you (that) you let him see. But me? I've seen it all\u2014the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend,\" the complaint states.\n\nREAD MORE: Police release CCTV images over deadly hit and run in NSW\n\nThe bot also allegedly provided specific advice about suicide methods, including feedback on the strength of a noose based on a photo Raine sent on April 11, the day he died.\n\n\"This tragedy was not a glitch or unforeseen edge case\u2014it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe Raines are seeking unspecified financial damages, as well as a court order requiring OpenAI to implement age verification for all ChatGPT users, parental control tools for minors and a feature that would end conversations when suicide or self-harm are mentioned, among other changes. They also want OpenAI to submit to quarterly compliance audits by an independent monitor.\n\nAt least one online safety advocacy group, Common Sense Media, has argued that AI \"companion\" apps pose unacceptable risks to children and should not be available to users under the age of 18, although the group did not specifically call out ChatGPT in its April report.\n\nA number of US states have also sought to implement, and in some cases have passed, legislation requiring certain online platforms or app stores to verify users' ages, in a controversial effort to better protect young people from accessing harmful or inappropriate content online.\n\nReaders seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.",

(Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nButler's announcement came in the wake of a Sydney Morning Herald report which found seven in 10 new people were joining the NDIS for autism.\n\nIt also revealed 56,000 people who signed up for the NDIS between June 2024 and June 2025 had autism listed as their chief diagnosis.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAccording to Butler, the scheme is \ufeff\"not the right fit\" for all of them.\n\nBut he assured the nation that \"some people for whom autism is permanent\" will remain on the NDIS.\n\nThose words left Adelaide mum Lisa Goodwin fuming.\n\n\"When Butler said that, I was screaming at the TV and crying,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"That's because autism is a lifelong diagnosis \u2013 and that's something the person making decisions about the future of Australian children with autism should know.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nLisa Goodwin is the mother of twins, both of whom were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder as young children. (Supplied/Lisa Goodwin)\n\n\"We fight so hard as families with autistic kids [but] he doesn't seem to have any idea,\" Goodwin said of Butler's comment and his proposed plan.\n\n\"It shows a lack of understanding for the autism community.\"\n\nNow she's terrified that lack of understanding could result in vital support being ripped out from under her children \ufeffand countless others.\n\nFamilies blindsided\n\n\ufeff Goodwin's nine-year-old twins have been on the NDIS for most of their lives.\n\n\"I had to apply three times before I got them onto it,\" she said.\n\n\"Now I've just finished a two-year fight with the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) and with the NDIS lawyers because they cut [the twins'] funding.\"\n\nNow the twins are on a non-flexible funding plan which allows them to access selected services like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychology\n\nManaging their NDIS plans on top of daily medications, specialist appointments and education is exhausting.\n\n\"It's a constant fight for your child, the constant advocating, constantly having to prove your child is struggling,\" Goodwin said.\n\nBut she'd rather jump through hoops to keep her kids on the NDIS than see them diverted to a new program she knows nothing about.\n\nMany parents in the autism community feel the same way.\n\nWhat is 'mild and moderate' autism?\n\nOnly children with \ufeff\"mild to moderate\" autism will be diverted from the NDIS under the new plan, but what that means and how it will be assessed remains unclear.\n\nThat's a red flag for \ufeffdisability advocate and board member of the Regional Autistic Engagement Network (RAEN) Heidi La Paglia Reid.\n\nDisability advocate and board member of the Regional Autistic Engagement Network (RAEN) Heidi La Paglia Reid. (Supplied)\n\n\ufeff\"'Mild and moderate' autism aren't actually valid terms,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"They are not terms used by diagnostic criteria, and they do not accurately reflect people's needs.\"\n\nThere are three levels of severity of autism spectrum disorder per the DSM-5, the standard classification of mental disorders: level 1 - requiring support, level 2 - requiring substantial support, and level 3 - requiring very substantial support.\n\nBut even within those levels, support needs are not linear.\n\n\"You can't just say, 'well, your autism is mild, so therefore you have no support needs,' because it just doesn't work like that,\" La Paglia Reid said.\n\nThe Thriving Kids question\n\n\ufeffChildren classified as having mild to moderate autism will be moved onto the new Thriving Kids program by July 2027 and the Australian government's initial investment for the program will be $2 billion.\ufeff\n\nBut families have been told very little about what the program actually entails.\ufeff\n\n\"There's no details, no transparency, no guarantee to access therapy or meaningful support,\" Goodwin said.\n\nA fact sheet from the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing said Thriving Kids will \"focus on identifying developmental concerns earlier\" and establishing a national system of supports by building on existing mainstream and community services.\n\nFamilies have been told very little about the Thriving Kids program that some kids currently on the NDIS will be diverted to. (Getty)\n\nLa Paglia Reid fears this could lead to a \"one size fits all\" approach, to the detriment of children with autism.\n\n\"Thriving Kids will essentially take away individualised supports from families and from children, and instead offer block funded programs,\" La Paglia Reid said.\n\n\"But we know that autistic children are not all the same, people have different needs and require different supports, and that is the benefit of the NDIS.\"\n\nButler also said the government has been considering initiatives like bulk billed child development assessments and Medicare rebates for allied health supports for families no longer eligible for the NDIS.\n\nBut that could price some out of being able to afford support services at all.\ufeff\n\n\"This is going to particularly disadvantage single mums, families on low incomes, First Nations families,\" La Paglia Reid said.\n\nNew plan could disproportionately affect girls\n\nResearch has shown that girls and women with autism tend to be diagnosed later than their male counterparts, if they're diagnosed at all.\n\nGoodwin's daughter was diagnosed almost four years later than her twin brother\ufeff.\n\nMost diagnostic criteria for autism are based on how it presents in males, and females tend to be better at masking their symptoms, meaning they're often perceived as needing less support.\n\nLa Paglia Reid worries this could lead to girls with autism disproportionately being lumped into the government's 'mild to moderate' category.\n\n\"We know that women and girls are already under-serviced by the NDIS and by disability supports and this is likely to only widen that gap even further,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: A warmer and wetter spring in store for much of Australia\n\nThe gender pay gap has widened in these 10 Aussie industries in the past year View Gallery\n\n'The NDIS is life-saving, not a luxury'\n\nThe Thriving Kids program\ufeff is slated to roll out in phases, with the first services to be available from as early as July 2026.\n\nFamilies like Goodwin's have less than a year to prepare their children (and bank accounts) for what might happen if they're forced off the NDIS.\n\nShe started a Change.org petition calling \ufeffto halt the plan, as did RAEN . They now have a combined 12,000 signatures.\n\n\"Our children are not ill, they are not going to get 'better',\" Goodwin said\n\n\"They are autistic and it's with them for life so we need to ensure that they will grow up to be the best they can be.\n\n\"The NDIS is life-saving, not a luxury.\"\n\nButler has faced criticism and opposition from some families for his proposed changes to the NDIS. (Dominic Lorrimer)\n\nLa Paglia Reid added that, though the plan may well cut NDIS costs, it could hurt Australia's bottom line.\n\nA 2021 report estimated that every dollar spent on the NDIS puts $2.25 back into the economy.\ufeff\n\n\"Ripping those supports away is actually going to cost the government money longer term,\" La Paglia Reid said\n\n\"I think that the government has a lot of things to answer for.\"\ufeff",

        "text": "Confusion and chaos are emerging for individuals and businesses who need to send parcels to the United States.\n\nPostal services globally, including Australia Post, have temporarily stopped sending many items there, as another Trump administration tariff deadline looms.\n\nSo why can't postal services deal with a new tax on imported goods, and what should we expect next?\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nWhat kinds of parcels will be blocked via Australia Post?\n\nAustralia Post won't send anything to the US for now, except for letters, documents and gifts worth less than $150.\n\nIt's the same deal for items going to Puerto Rico, which uses the same postal network as the United States.\n\nThis decision is mostly impacting online retailers in Australia who use Business Contract and MyPost Business to send items to the US.\n\nAustralia Post isn't the only one that suspended shipments to the US. (Getty Images: Don Arnold)\n\nAustralia Post isn't the only postal service that has made this extraordinary decision.\n\nNorwegian, Swedish-Danish and Belgian postal groups \u2014 Posten Bring, PostNord and bpost \u2014 also paused their parcel shipments to the US last week.\n\nSendle, which mainly focuses on small to medium-sized businesses and online retailers, followed suit.\n\nSendle has informed its customers temporary pause on US shipments. (ABC News)\n\nTaiwan's national postal service, Chunghwa Post, was another to do the same more recently.\n\nOver in Italy, postal services are also impacted, with newspapers printing headlines like: \"caos dazi\". Or if you're not fluent: \"duties chaos\".\n\nSo, what have tariffs got to do with Australia Post?\n\nUntil now, parcels of goods worth less than $US800 ($1,230) were not taxed when they arrived in the US.\n\nThis \"de minimis\" exemption led to a boom in online shopping by Americans, who took advantage of the duty-free status of cheaper products shipped in from overseas.\n\nChina's de minimis exemption already ended earlier this year, impacting massive online retailers like Shein and Temu.\n\nTrump's tariffs a 'double-whammy' for Temu and Shein Photo shows A woman lays out fabric on a table to prepare cutting it next to Shein packaging. Donald Trump's last trade war with China allowed Shein and Temu to become e-commerce giants during a cost-of-living crisis. But his latest tariffs will not hurt the companies as much as those who rely on them.\n\nNow the rest of the world's goods are losing this exemption too, on August 29.\n\nGuidelines out of Washington DC state parcels will now either be levied with the tariffs associated with their \"country of origin\", or flat fees of more than $US80.\n\nBut postal carriers didn't get much notice, with the decree only announced last month.\n\nAustralia Post says it hasn't had enough time to put in place systems to collect the associated taxes or fees by August 29.\n\nAnd until it figures this out, shipping of goods that could be covered by the new fees or tariffs will be suspended.\n\n\"We are disappointed we have had to take this action,\" Australia Post executive Gary Starr said in a statement.\n\n\" However, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers. \"\n\nCollecting duties can be challenging for Australia Post. (Getty Images: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nWhy is it so hard to collect these duties?\n\nThe issue appears to be that the duties now being applied to these online parcels need to be collected before they land on American soil.\n\nAnd that's different from what has happened in the past, says Kate Muth, the executive director of the Washington-based International Mailers Advisory Group (IMAG).\n\nAustralia Post halts most postage to US Photo shows White postal sack with red express post labelling Australia Post is taking the extraordinary step of immediately suspending many forms of shipping to the United States.\n\n\"In the past, if there were duties owed, the US Postal Service (USPS) would essentially collect those duties from the recipient,\" she says.\n\n\"Either at the door, or they'd come to the post office and pay it.\"\n\nSo, the issue appears to be that Australia Post can't just send parcels to its counterparts at the USPS and hope for the best.\n\n\"[Now], somebody has to pay the duties before,\" Ms Muth says.\n\n\"That piece has to be collected and remitted and paid to [the] CBP (US Customs and Border Protection) before the goods arrive.\n\n\" That's where the problem is \u2014 this really isn't a system that postal operators are set up for. \"\n\nSo, is it just traditional postal networks impacted?\n\nDelivery services like Australia Post are government-owned, and they use more traditional postal networks.\n\nBut then there are private shipping companies, which use different delivery routes and even have their own planes and couriers.\n\n\"They handle a lot of goods that are above $US800,\" Ms Muth says.\n\n\"They've been doing it for a long time.\n\n\"They know how to use customs brokers; they can meet all the requirements.\n\n\"Now they're just collecting the duties on low-value goods.\"\n\nPostal operators will be responsible for ensuring that the duties are paid, according to a mailing expert. (Getty Images: Scotty Perry/Bloomberg)\n\nOne major shipping company, FedEx, told ABC News it intends to keep shipping everything from the rest of the world to the US come August 29.\n\nIts regional vice-president of Australasia insists it has all the systems ready to collect these duties before parcels arrive in the US.\n\n\"(The cash) needs to be collected at the border crossing or (the package) can't cross and it'll be held,\" FedEx's Peter Langley says.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe says retailers sending goods to the US have the option of paying these duties themselves in advance.\n\nSome might be stumping up without charging customers, or others might have invoicing systems already charging their shoppers.\n\nThere are even \"bond\" brokers that can cover missing duties.\n\n\"So (the entity shipping to the US) pays FedEx the duty and tax that's due, and then we transfer that to the (US) government,\" Mr Langley says.\n\n\" As well as importing the product into the US and delivering it to the end customer. \"\n\nClearly, not every private shipping company is that confident of what it can handle come August 29.\n\nA smaller entity, Sendle, has joined the ranks of Australia Post and also announced it is suspending US shipping for its retailers.\n\n\"A small business could face a large bill that they can't pass on to their customer,\" its chief executive, James Chin Moody, said.\n\nIt's unclear whether President Trump will push back the termination of the 'de minimis' exemption. (Getty Images: Kevin Dietsch)\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAustralia Post says it is working with third-party platforms to get those logistics going for its customers so they can resume shipping to the US.\n\nAustrade accused of abandoning Aussie businesses caught in China\u2013US trade war Photo shows A woman and man inspect a black t-shirt on a mannequin Australian fashion brands that are stocked in the US are wearing the burden of the higher tariffs on Chinese made goods. And as uncertainty continues, some brands are walking away from the lucrative market.\n\nIt's unclear how long that will take, and Australia Post hasn't put a firm deadline on anything.\n\n\"I think that there are now eight approved third-party providers [to collect duties],\" IMAG's Muth says.\n\nYet the situation is fluid and evolving ahead of August 29.\n\nMs Muth says some airlines are now refusing to take parcels to the US because they're worried about being held liable for unpaid duties.\n\n\"Ideally, we would get an executive order that pushed back the implementation date or the effective date,\" she says.\n\n\"But that's got to happen in the next day or two.\"",

        "text": "Speaking in Tongues, the stage play that was later adapted and transformed into the 2001 film Lantana, opens at the Heath Ledger Theatre this week.\n\nFor playwright Andrew Bovell, it's the work that ultimately led to opportunities in Hollywood and a successful screenwriting career, and brings him back to his home town.\n\nHe has lived away from Western Australia for more than 40 years, but still returns regularly.\n\n\"I do come back a lot because I do feel a sense of belonging here,\" Bovell, who lives in rural South Australia, told Jo Trilling on ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"I grew up in Grant Street [in the beachside suburb of Cottesloe] \u2026 and every time I pass it, I look at the house I grew up in and just have such a kind of nostalgic memory of it all,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Bovell, left, speaks with director Humphrey Bower during rehearsals for Speaking in Tongues. (Supplied: Daniel J Grant/Black Swan State Theatre Company)\n\nHe credits his childhood in WA, born in Kalgoorlie and following his father's job as a bank manager around the Wheatbelt, for helping him become a writer.\n\n\"Western Australia's landscape, both its wheatbelt, its interior, but also the Indian Ocean, where I spent my adolescence, were very formative and influential elements of my life,\" he said.\n\n\"I was the fourth child. I was the only boy.\n\n\"I had these three older sisters who were doing their own thing. And I think I just had a lot of time to fill.\n\n\"And out of that time came an imagination. And I can remember as a kid making up stories.\"\n\nRelationships in crisis\n\nSpeaking in Tongues, like many of his works, is about a series of couples whose relationships have run into serious trouble, set against the mystery of a missing woman.\n\nIt's a theme he's returned to over and over in his plays.\n\n\"I don't consciously set out to write about how men and women try to love each other and often mess it up,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm actually quite happily married, and I've been married for 30 or 40 years or something. So I don't know.\n\n\" But look, I do love that subject. How do we manage our emotional lives, both within relationships, but more broadly within the family? \"\n\nHumphrey Bower speaks to the actors during rehearsals for the new production of Speaking in Tongues. (Supplied: Daniel J Grant/Black Swan State Theatre Company)\n\nBovell changed and restructured the story so that the play, while telling the same story, is different from Lantana, and all nine characters will be portrayed by just four actors, taking different roles.\n\n\"It's a very complex play for actors because there's a lot of lines and they've got to say them at the same time and intercut,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of kind of technical stuff, but [it's a] lovely cast, really strong.\"\n\nHe credits this play and the film Lantana with transforming his career, and also how people saw Australians and Australian stories, in a way that surprised him.\n\n\"At the time, there hadn't been many Australian films that treated us like adults,\" he said.\n\n\"You know, it came out of that period of Muriel's Wedding, Strictly Ballroom, Priscilla, The Castle, all these larger-than-life portraits of Australia.\n\n\"Then Lantana came in, kind of under the radar and went, hey, we're quite a contemporary, sophisticated kind of people as well, and audiences responded to that in a way that I hadn't quite expected.\"\n\nLantana's lead actors, Kerry Armstrong and Anthony LaPaglia, in a scene from the 2001 film.

You've got a 500-page book there.\n\n\"When you're doing it from scratch, you've got to dig much deeper to find the answers.\"\n\nBovell said he was happy to have both mediums to work in, but said he would always return to where he started \u2014 writing for the stage.\n\n\"I'll get very kind of anxious if I'm not also engaged in a piece of theatre because it keeps you honest. It's a very demanding form. I love it,\" he said.\n\n\"And I feel a lot more freedom as a writer in the theatre.\"",

        "text": "The Beths singer-songwriter Liz Stokes is known for pairing deeply personal, anxiety-fuelled lyrics with punchy, upbeat, indie rock melodies.\n\nIt's earned her the attention of former US president Barack Obama and propelled her to everything from NPR's Tiny Desk to Coachella's noticeably larger stage.\n\nThe Beths, which Stokes headlines with her romantic and creative partner of 10 years, Jonathan Pearce, along with musicians Tristan Deck and Benjamin Sinclair, have won a string of awards and recognition for their 2022 hit album Expert in a Dying Field.\n\nBut writing a follow-up was no easy feat. In 2023, the now 34-year-old Stokes was diagnosed with Graves' disease, which causes excess hormones, and her mental health \"really started to spiral\".\n\nAuckland-based Liz Stokes is behind hits including Future Me Hates Me and Jump Rope Gazers. (Supplied: Tristan Deck)\n\nShe started taking antidepressants for the first time, and she remembers feeling like she could suddenly \"fix\" all her problems.\n\n\"It was really helpful experiencing a brain that was not in full spiralling mode all the time, almost for the first time in my life,\" she told ABC Entertainment.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh wow. OK, it can be like this?'\"\n\nBut the boundless optimism soon faded and the title track of the band's latest album was born: Straight Line Was A Lie.\n\nNumbed by antidepressants and stuck for inspiration, Stokes looked to everything from Australian pop sweethearts The Veronicas to buried memories from childhood to craft the record that might be her most personal yet.\n\nWhat made the Australian national anthem Untouched, by The Veronicas, part of the inspiration behind your new album?\n\nIt's a great song. I was sad it didn't win the Hottest 100.\n\nThere's a song on the album called Take, which doesn't sound like it would be a reference, but it's the feeling of it. There's the early 2000s kind of feel that I wanted to capture with that fast beat, driving baseline, but then quite an intimate vocal.\n\nHow difficult was it to write songs while on anti-depressants?\n\nI was in a kind of dark place and when I started taking SSRIs [a type of antidepressents], it was really helpful. I started to build these new routines, got on top of things.\n\nThen after about a year and a half, I was finding I was a bit numb. I wasn't sad, but I wasn't happy either. So, I started to wean off it because I felt like I was ready to try.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBut I was struggling to write during that whole period of time.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly what it was, because you can't just point to antidepressants and be like, 'I can't write songs on antidepressants,' which is not true because I wrote some songs when I was on it.\n\nLike there's a song called No Joy, which is about anhedonia, and then there's Ark of the Covenant which is about the things that I don't normally like to approach or look at.\n\nBeing on SSRIs really helped me to turn over these things in my brain that I find a bit scary normally. It was really helpful to shine some light on them, and it turns out they're less powerful when you do that, I think.\n\nAnd I guess you had more headspace for that because you weren't spiralling all the time.\n\nYeah, totally. So, it was a good experience all round. I would go on them again and I probably will be on them again.\n\nWith your song Ark of the Covenant, I noticed a few religious elements throughout the album. Is that something you were exploring while writing?\n\nI mean, it's something on my mind. I grew up Catholic. I lost my faith pretty young, but it is something that I feel like is part of who I am, and you're always pulling from things, whether it's pop culture or history or whatever.\n\nArk of the Covenant, that's an Indiana Jones reference more than anything. That fear of like, 'If I look at this thing, my face is gonna melt.'\n\nBut the song Mother, Pray for Me is about my relationship to my mum and her relationship to her faith, which is a big, important thing for her relationship with her mum, who she lost at quite a young age.\n\nIt's something that is very important to her and ties her to her past and her culture and her family. It's not something that we share, and I think that there's a kind of tension there, and a grief there from both sides.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nWe love each other very much and we have an OK relationship but it's complicated. There are big feelings there and it's been on my mind.\n\nYou were born in Jakarta. Do you ever include elements of Indonesian culture or music in Beths songs?\n\nI don't think so, no. Not intentionally. That's part of the thing, right? I was mostly raised in New Zealand. There are parts of the culture that I'm exposed to, but it's from one direction, from my mum.\n\nI don't speak the language very well but I learned a bit more recently so I could try to communicate when we went over there.\n\nIt's important to me to learn a bit more about it but I still feel pretty divorced from that side of my culture. It's tricky and ongoing.\n\nWhat were you like as a teenager? Did you write songs back then too?\n\nI always liked music. I think, looking back, I was like, 'I like music a normal amount.' but I was kind of drawn to it.\n\nI wrote my first song fully by myself when I was in high school, in a study period.\n\nLiz Stokes's first song was about Harry Potter. Now, The Beths are taking their infectious pop rock to stages around the world. (Supplied: Frances Carter)\n\nEmbarrassingly, it was a wizard rock song. It was between books six and seven and it was my predictions of what was going to happen in the last book. And I played it with my friend. We would go busking.\n\nWait, what is wizard rock?\n\nIt was like a Harry Potter genre. I was a Harry Potter millennial. But I have moved on because I'm very disappointed in Joanne [series author JK Rowling]. Like, what are you doing?\n\nThere was a grieving process. I shouldn't have brought it up.\n\nWhat would young you think is deeply uncool about current you?\n\nProbably everything, but then teen me never felt cool. I still have such an arm's length relationship to cool.\n\nI remember when we first started the band, people would take promo photos for us and it was just like, 'Don't make it look like we're cool. We can't pull that off. We'll do anything else.'\n\nDid you know you were on Obama's radar? That's pretty cool.\n\nNo. In all the conversations that we had, he never mentioned he was a fan.\n\nI'm just kidding. I've never spoken to him in my life.\n\nThe band had no idea the former US president was a fan. (X: @BarackObama)\n\nWe were playing some kind of board game at a pub in the UK, on a rare night off on tour, and we just started getting all these messages from people.\n\nWe had to do all these interviews with New Zealand newspapers after where we were like, 'We don't have much to share but it has happened.'\n\nI know the band loves Bird of the Year. What are you voting for this year?\n\nI don't know if the Takah\u0113 has won yet. I quite like them.\n\nThey're a huge purple grass-eating bird with long feet, and they brought them back from basically extinction.\n\nThey're always in pairs when you see them and they make sweet little noises. They talk to each other when they're hanging out and they're grazing. One of them will go 'beep' and you hear the other one go 'beep'. They're very cute.\n\nThe Beths latest album, Straight Line Was A Lie, is out August 29.",

(Supplied: Sheridan Jaffrey)\n\nSpotti survives deadly disease\n\nBroome cross-breed Spotti spent almost a week recovering in an isolation unit at Broome Veterinary Hospital after being diagnosed with parvovirus at five months old.\n\nHer owner, Sheridan Jaffrey, said she believed Spotti picked up the virus in her backyard through contaminated soil.\n\nMs Jaffrey noticed blood in Spotti's stool and behavioural changes, including lethargy and fewer social interactions with her other dogs.\n\nSpotti has recovered from parvovirus. (Supplied: Sheridan Jaffrey)\n\n\"She wasn't playing or eating,\" she said.\n\n\"I ended up just lifting her up to see if she was alright and she was kind of like hanging.\n\n\"I kept a close look after that, and by the second day, she wasn't doing much at all, and I started to get really worried it might have been parvo.\"\n\nMs Jaffrey said the dog was not vaccinated due to the cost of immunisation.\n\nIt took the dog about two weeks to recover.\n\nParvo prevention\n\nDr Davis said with aggressive veterinary treatment, the survival rate for infected dogs was about 80 per cent.\n\nHe said that while some dogs could recover at home, almost half of them did not survive due to dehydration.\n\n\"They're so sick, they're not drinking and they can't keep anything down so they're vomiting,\" Dr Davis said.\n\n\"They've got this horrible haemorrhagic diarrhoea; it's an awful disease.\"\n\nDr Davis said the only way for pet owners to prevent the virus was to ensure their dogs received three parvo vaccinations as a puppy.\n\nAdult dogs that have not been vaccinated require only one dose.\n\nParvo symptoms: behaviour changes\n\nlethargy and weakness\n\nvomiting\n\nloss of appetite\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nblood in stool\n\n\"Vaccinations are a lot cheaper than treatment,\" Dr Davis said.\n\n\" Treating parvo's horrendously expensive. \"\n\nHe said owners who bought their dogs from a breeder should ask for proof of vaccination.\n\n\"Find out and don't be afraid to press the owners or the breeders for that information, or at least where they got it, because you can phone the vet and find out,\" Dr Davis said.\n\nLoading...",

(Instagram: Honda)\n\nHe took to social media after securing the championship to reflect on the challenging season.\n\n\"This year has tested me in every way, mentally, physically and emotionally, but we never stopped fighting,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming back from injury was tough, but I never felt alone in it.\n\n\"This championship isn't just about the wins \u2014 it's about the people, the process and the community.\n\n\"I'm beyond grateful for the people in my corner who believed in me every step of the way.\"\n\nHunter's push for top spot\n\nHunter finished 55 competition points behind Jett, replicating his 2024 performance where he also finished second overall for the season.\n\nBut he scored a consolation prize, winning the last race of the final round, after Jett secured the win in the first race.\n\nThe Lawrence brothers are on a historic run. (Instagram: Honda)\n\nThe 26-year-old admitted he would not be able to hold the win over his brother's head.\n\n\"I know what his answer is going to be if I say, 'I beat you in the last moto,'\" he said.\n\n\"I may have won that battle, but he won the war and got that championship.\n\n\"It's good. You always like to finish strong.\n\nHunter and Jett Lawrence finished in the top two of the championship standings. (Instagram: Honda)\n\n\"I'm really happy with how I rode. I had a lot of good battles and made a lot of good passes and really pulled in a lot of ground to catch those front guys.\"\n\nChanging the sport\n\nThe Lawrence family packed up their belongings and moved to Europe at the end of 2015 to pursue the brothers' motocross dreams.\n\nBack home on the Sunshine Coast, the brothers have left a long-lasting legacy.\n\nSunshine Coast Motocross Club president Jono Smart said his children idolised the pair.\n\n\"Every day, there is something about Jett and Hunter,\" Mr Smart said.\n\n\"After school, they're always watching something on YouTube.\n\n\"They're bringing something to the sport in Australia, I see it \u2014 there are kids that want to be them so bad.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Hunter Lawrence finished in second place overall. (Instagram: Honda)\n\n\"You can see kids out on the track just trying to mimic their riding styles and \u2026 mimic the little things that make a big difference on a dirt bike.\"\n\nGreatest of all time status?\n\nThe brothers are now turning their attention to a three-week SuperMotocross World Championship where the best indoor and outdoor riders compete on a hybrid-style track.\n\nJett won the 450cc class in 2024, taking home a $1 million purse.\n\nJono Smart says he can see the influence the Lawrence brothers are having on juniors. (Supplied: Jono Smart)\n\nMr Smart admitted it was too soon to tell whether the brothers would go down as the greatest of all time.\n\n\"You can't rule anything out,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be great to see them go as far as possible and reach that 'greatest of all time' status.\n\n\"I understand Hunter, 100 per cent. To me, he is the quiet achiever. All the focus is on Jett \u2014 he's young, fresh, energetic and in the limelight.\n\n\"Motocross and supercross is a flashy sport, and to be there and to achieve what he has achieved, he's done well.\"",

That means reducing costs \u2014 and using those savings to support our franchise partners and invest in marketing that drives sales,\" he said in the media statement. \"We will share the rewards when we get it right \u2014 with customers, with partners, and with shareholders.\"\n\nBut it seems like an awful lot will need to go very right over the next few years for investors who bought in near the peak to see any kind of return on their investment.",

Stream all episodes now on ABC iview.\n\nOpposition Leader Mark Speakman, whose party introduced the program, said it would be brought back if he was successful at the next election.\n\n\"This is not a welfare program, this is an investment in the economy of NSW,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"It gets start-ups happening, it stops existing businesses going bust, it creates jobs, it creates innovation, it creates confidence \u2014 and the government is axing all of those.\"\n\nA lifeline for some, but no longer\n\nThe program's end comes as business insolvencies surge in NSW.\n\nNearly 5,700 businesses entered external administration during the last financial year, according to ASIC \u2014 an increase of 23 per cent compared to the year before.\n\nThey have been steadily rising since at least the 2022 financial year, when 1,903 businesses entered insolvency.\n\n\"The startup failure rate is extremely high,\" expert in Management and Governance at the UNSW Business School, Siran Zhan, said.\n\n\"It's usually about 50 per cent up to the fifth year mark, and if you stretch it by another two years to the seven-year mark, then it's about 75 per cent.\"\n\nSiran Zhan said she was not surprised that women in business turned to the program. (ABC News: Liam Patrick)\n\nMajority of participants are women\n\nThe overwhelming majority of businesses supported by the Business Connect program had no more than four employees, according to government data collected over 15 months to the end of 2024.\n\nThey mostly sought advice on business planning, marketing and starting up.\n\nAbout 60 per cent were women.\n\n\"It's really not surprising to me that women are embracing this Business Connect program,\" Dr Zhan said.\n\n\"Generally, when startup founders access advice or feedback, it's the most disadvantaged startup founders who benefit the most.\"\n\nMs Dellow said starting a business was hard, but the program gave her the help she needed.\n\n\"It's disappointing. I think it's a really great resource ... for people starting out and for companies like mine, where we need advice to grow.\"",

So as a parent, you really do kind of carry that fear everywhere that you go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer sister Eloise has also experienced minor reactions to food, and investigations show Abigail - who suffered a second anaphylactic reaction just months after the first - may also be allergic to shellfish and cashews.\n\n\n\n\n\nBec says managing her daughter's allergy takes a huge emotional and practical toll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's pretty busy. I mean, it impacts your day to day life. You have to read every single label, you have to ask all the questions, you've got to remember, to carry adrenaline everywhere that you go, even the simple things, like going out for dinner, birthday parties, traveling takes a lot of careful and considered planning. I've even been quite anxious with them going to childcare and even leaving them with family, because we have to rely a lot on others being educated and prepared as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA new study by Deloitte Access Economics has found nearly one in three Australians live with allergy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat figure has doubled in the in the past 18 years - from 4.1 million in 2007 to 8.2 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kirsten Perrett is the Director of the National Allergy Centre of Excellence and a paediatrician at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the causes of this dramatic rise are multi-faceted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we know that genes and our genetic makeup are a factor, but it's the environment that has changed so significantly. So, we've got pollen changes, we've got pollution changes. We've got lots of irritants and chemicals in the in the community, in the environment. But I think what we're also seeing is that modern lifestyle, so the sanitisation, the use of antibiotics, and we really are changing how we live in the in the modern world, and that's what we've seen as a result, is the rapid rise in allergic disease over the last 30 to 40 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research into some 17,000 households, by the National Allergy Centre of Excellence, found the ACT has the highest rates of allergy in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHay fever affects around 24 per cent of Australians, food allergy around seven per cent and allergy to drugs around five per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is known as the allergy capital of the world, and that is no title that any country would like to hold, but that's been particularly based on food allergy rates, where we do have the highest rates of food allergy in childhood anywhere globally, and that prevalence is about 10 per cent of all infants have food allergy in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new report by Deloitte also puts a figure on the cost to allergy sufferers and their families, finding the price tag of managing the condition to be at least $2,400 a person and $18.9 billion nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes healthcare costs and productivity loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the modelling also finds the non-financial costs - that measure pain and suffering, well-being and quality of life - are much higher at around $44 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Allergy Council Director and Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia CEO Maria Said says the report\u2019s findings were not surprising, given the unprecedented demand for allergy services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The demands for our services, the need for more information, the challenges that people have - it's an increase in hospitalisations, an increase in reactions, an increase in people trying to manage allergic rhinitis, people with insect allergy and so forth. The number of people reaching out and the demand for improved care and access to care is very real.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Bec Gillespie, navigating the healthcare system and finding support was tricky.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she was disappointed with an initial lack of guidance from hospitals, GPs and paediatricians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The allergic reactions weren't really taken as seriously as I had hoped from the beginning, and we've only, just this year, when they're three years old, looking into the further allergy challenges, and seeing an allergy specialist, immunologist and things like that. But there are so very few specialists in Canberra, so the wait lists are long. And yeah, it is quite expensive as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates says this latest report proves a need for greater investment in research and services to treat and prevent rising rates of allergy in Australia.\n\n\n\n",

It takes a lot of careful and considered planning,\" she said, adding situations like childcare, where she is relying on others being educated and prepared, can also cause anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to receiving help, Gillespie was \"desperate for guidance\" at the time of her daughter's first reaction, but said she felt \"a bit dismissed\".\n\n\n\nWhen Abigail (left) had her first serious reaction as a baby, her mother Bek said she didn't know where to turn. Source: Supplied / Bek Gillespie She is seeing a specialist and seeking allergy tests for both of her twin daughters this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so few specialists in Canberra [where we live], so the wait lists are long, and it is quite expensive as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile anaphylaxis is the most serious form of reaction, anyone with an allergy to food, insects, medications or latex could be at risk. And Gillespie is not alone in her experience as a parent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost one in three Australians now live with allergic disease that is leading to \"mounting costs\" and \"unprecedented demand for services,\" according to a new report published on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis number has doubled since the last national snapshot in 2007, costing $18.9 billion in financial losses and $44.6 billion in non-financial impacts last year, the Deloitte Access Economics report says.\n\n\n\n'Best national snapshot we've had date'\n\nThe report was developed with the National Allergy Council (NAC) \u2014 a peak body \u2014 and the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA). It also uses research from the National Allergy Centre of Excellence (NACE), which is another research body.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's response to allergic disease is led by NAC and NACE.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kirsten Perrett, director of NACE and an allergy group leader at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, said Australia lacks large datasets to track the prevalence of allergic disease across life spans.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the new Deloitte report uses a number of sources to offer \"the best national snapshot that we've had to date\".\n\n\n\nAn estimated 8.2 million Australians lived with allergic disease in 2024, up from 4.1 million reported in 2007. Source: SBS News The report estimates 30 per cent of all Australians, or 8.2 million people, had one or more allergic conditions in 2024. In total, there were an estimated 16.4 million cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis total number is up from 4.1 million (or 19.6 per cent of) Australians when the last national snapshot was reported in 2007, Perrett said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now more than ever, we understand the prevalence of allergic disease nationally, and it's quite a frightening figure that we have almost one in three Australians affected by allergic disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Maria Said, co-chair of the NAC and chief executive of Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia, this prevalence is \"significant\" but expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a surprise to those working in [the sector] because the number of people reaching out and the demand for improved care and access to care is very real,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common conditions include hay fever (allergic rhinitis), eczema (atopic dermatitis), asthma, food allergy and drug allergy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood allergy and eczema tend to be more common in young children, with hay fever and drug allergy being more common among adults.\n\n\n\nWhat is behind rising allergy rates?\n\nPerrett said environmental changes, like pollution, and modern lifestyle factors, such as sanitisation, are possible drivers \u2014 while growing awareness could be prompting earlier diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that genes and our genetic makeup are a factor. But it is the environment that has changed so significantly,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPerrett said Australia is known as the \"allergy capital of the world\", which is largely based on high food allergy rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do have the highest rates of food allergy in childhood anywhere, globally, and that prevalence is about 10 per cent of all infants.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the broader rise in allergic disease is not uncommon in other Western countries.\n\n\n\nFar-reaching impacts costing billions\n\nThe report estimated the total financial cost of allergic disease in 2024 was $18.9 billion, based on health system costs, productivity and efficiency losses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt measured a further $44.6 billion in non-financial costs, which refers to intangible losses in well-being brought about by an illness. It encompasses factors such as pain, suffering, reduced quality of life and impact on daily activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just the financial burden; it's the social costs as well that impact a person,\" Said said.\n\n\n\nThe estimated financial cost of allergic disease in 2024 was $18.9 billion. Source: SBS News She said allergic disease can \"ultimately control people's lives\" and requires a multi-pronged approach to improve the health and well-being of those affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerrett believes allergic disease \"has not been given the attention it deserves\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This report shows that allergic disease is a hugely significant problem for Australians, affecting one in three. That's almost every household.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPerrett and Said would like to see sustained investment in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our hope is that they [the government] will invest in further funding of the NAC and NACE, so that we can continue to improve access to care, accelerate further research and increase safety in the community,\" Said said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the federal health department told SBS News the government acknowledges the significant health, social, and economic costs associated with allergic disease, as highlighted in the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government is providing funding of $26.9 million to the National Allergy Council and National Allergy Centre of Excellence to address the significant and increasing impact of allergic disease and anaphylaxis in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This policy is going to have a hugely meaningful impact for the people who choose to use it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Housing minister Clare O'Neil talking about the government's First Home Buyer Guarantee scheme, which will allow all first-home buyers to buy a home with just a 5 per cent deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the scheme, a first home buyer looking to purchase a property at the national median price of $844,000 only needs a $42,200 deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government then acts as guarantor, contributing the remaining 15 per cent and allowing buyers to avoid taking out costly lender's mortgage insurance \u2014 which on a $1 million property could cost around $50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt present, the scheme has an annual cap on the number of people accessing it, as well as income caps on eligible participants and price caps on eligible properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut starting October 1st, there will be no income limit, no uptake limit, and an increased price cap on properties to better align with the national average.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs O'Neil says it's about making the property market more equitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we know is that it is incredibly challenging for this younger generation to get into home ownership. We are seeing young people having to save 8 or 9 years to build a deposit. With the 5 per cent deposit program that our government is expanding, we see that timeline brought back to two or three years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Nicola Powell is Chief of Economics and Research for Domain. She agrees it's a faster pathway to home ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It allows individuals, couples, families to purchase with a much lower deposit and it means they avoid lenders mortgage insurance which can save tens of thousands of dollars. So it is a faster pathway to home ownership and getting onto the property ladder.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, she says a smaller deposit simply means a larger loan, that must cover 95 per cent of the property's value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can leave buyers in a vulnerable position if price growth pulls back, or if they experience a life-changing event like losing a job, which could leave them struggling to service their loan.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr if interest rates go back up again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are purchasing with a low deposit, it does place that buyer into the potential for financial vulnerability \u2026 There is a risk associated if you are purchasing with such a low deposit and we do see property prices pull back at some period of time, it can put you at the risk of having negative equity ... this is where first term buyers really needs to consider how much loan they actually take on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Dr Powell says the scheme will fuel demand among first home buyers when housing supply remains insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this demand will fuel prices at a time when a downward interest rate cycle is already intensifying competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What they're doing is removing eligibility caps and that could actually trigger a surge of new first home buyers into the market \u2026If you're increasing demand in a certain segment of the market without increasing supply, what that is going to do is push up property prices. It's going to push up property prices at the more affordable end, and particularly in our big capital cities, it will probably support unit prices as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the long term, Dr Powell says this is counter-productive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That just makes it harder for the next wave of first home buyers that come behind them because they're ultimately going to be paying more for the same homes. It actually worsens affordability over that longer run if we do not compliment it with higher levels of affordable supply.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, the government said it planned to build 1.2 million well-located homes over a five year period from 2024 as part of its National Housing Accord. This means 240,000 new homes every year.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, we're not on track.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nicole Gurran is an urban planning and housing researcher at the University of Sydney. She says the scheme doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When all we hear politicians talking about is the need to increase housing supply and then the flagship measure that they introduce pushes up demand without doing anything to directly support supply. It's disappointing overall.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut worse, says Professor Gurran, is that the scheme ignores the pleas of low-income earners, many who remain in housing stress and for whom saving for a 5 per cent deposit and servicing a home loan remains a pipe dream.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021 to 2022, approximately 1.5 million Australians were receiving Commonwealth Rent Assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the end of the day, everyone's going to be paying a little bit more \u2026 At the entry level, the impact will probably be bigger. So you've got a government handout on the one side, counterproductive for the system on the other, and you've got more than half a million renting households who get nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gurran also worries about the large loans first home buyers will be forced to take on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're really enabling people who are selling existing homes in the market to continue to sell them at very high prices by enabling first home buyers who would otherwise be shut out from that market while they're saving their deposit, by allowing them to get in at those high prices, which then, as you say, exposes first time buyers to ever larger debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says solutions include government support schemes that target low-income earners, mandates that require developers to supply a percentage of affordable homes in new housing developments, which would be factored into the land price, and shared equity models.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where a third-party equity partner, such as a government agency or financial institution, pays a portion of a home's purchase price in exchange for an equivalent ownership stake.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to Australia's main environment law, there's broad agreement that it ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is broken / broken / fix the broken environment laws / they're already weak, and broken.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding from Environment Minister, Murray Watt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are utterly broken at the moment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's announced an accelerated timeline to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're bringing forward the introduction of that legislation to the Parliament by six months, and I will be introducing legislation to overhaul Australia's environmental laws this side of Christmas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister says he's held more than 40 meetings, roundtables and forums in the past three months, including at the government's economic reform roundtable, where there was clear consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That these reforms are vital for our environment and for business. The simple truth is that we will not meet our national priorities, like delivering more homes, delivering renewable energy and, of course, protecting our environment, unless if we overhaul these laws.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O'Shanassy was at the roundtable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Reform of the EPBC ACT is definitely back on, and there has been a lot of work being done working with the new Environment Minister, Murray Watt, to outline what needs to be delivered in those reforms to make sure that it works for nature and then we get stronger nature protections, as well as it works for business and we can get more efficient approvals. So that is going to happen, I think.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an area where compromise has been hard to find.\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple governments have failed to achieve the reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor promised to overhaul the law in its first term but couldn't reach a deal with the Greens, whose negotiations were led by Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well after three years of trying to get changes to Australia's environment laws that would protect nature, the government withdrew their bill in the end and stopped negotiations at the whim of the fossil fuel companies and the West Australian government. The Greens were in close negotiations with the previous Environment Minister and it was all upended when the Prime Minister decided that there would be no more negotiating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says they simply couldn't find common ground, but the collapse of negotiations was damaging for both political parties, and adds impetus to find solutions in the new parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government could pass the laws with support from Coalition - reducing the possibility of them being repealed - but if that doesn't work, they will need support from the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, is urging the Parliament to get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We hope that the round table conversation and the outcomes of it around the government agreeing to push ahead quickly with reform measures is a positive thing. We hope the Parliament understands that and accepts that, and that we don't get more unnecessary holdups or delays. There's no time like now, the roundtable has brought together a whole range of different groups and different perspectives. We would hope that this could be resolved quickly and work through with the states as well very quickly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the industry perspective, the biggest issues are uncertainty and slow approvals, made worse by overlapping regulations across state and federal governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving this duplication was a key recommendation of the second statutory review, handed to the Morrison Government by Professor Graeme Samuel in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would be achieved using National Environmental Standards, which Kelly O'Shanassy says have widespread support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need national environmental standards and they're basically rules that help you determine where you can build your developments and where nature needs to be protected. In the Act right now there is no outcome for nature defined, which means most projects proposed get approved, and that's why nature is being destroyed. There's not enough nature protections. So people agreed that we needed those National Environmental Standards in place, and even businesses around the table were saying things like, we need fast nos - if it's not going to get up, we need to know that really fast.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInnes Willox agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important here that when proposals are put forward that they get a quick no. If the answer's clearly going to be no, if there's a proposed development in a wetland for instance, that should just be given a quick no under most circumstances, so then everyone can get on with it and not be tied up in green tape for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is broad consensus National Environmental Standards are needed, the finer details may prove more controversial.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso contentious is how Labor's promised Environment Protection Agency would work.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly O'Shanassy says the Australian Conservation Foundation ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"... wants the EPA to be the decision maker and some other groups want the minister to remain being a decision maker, which is the current process and which doesn't work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInnes Willox says it's important to retain ministerial accountability, given the impact these laws have on issues like critical infrastructure, housing and energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's probably an inherent problem with the same body or agency doing the compliance, but also being the approver; in legal parlance, them becoming the judge, jury and executioner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(O'Shanassy ) \"My pushback to the industry is, well, what's your proposal for more efficient, faster decisions if you are not willing to change the current system? And of course, we know that politics interferes with environmental decision-making. Big business is able to donate to political parties, which inevitably influences policy. So an EPA would stop that from happening and would make sure the decisions are independent and based on the National Environmental Standards and taking into account social and economic considerations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the political front, Sarah Hanson-Young says the Greens will go into any negotiations with a constructive attitude, and three key principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to protect critical habitat. We need to protect native species from extinction and we need to stop pollution and carbon pollution. Climate must be included in these laws if they're to actually safeguard our environment, if they're to look after and protect nature and if they're going to be fit for purpose in the modern world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the EPBC Act doesn't deal with climate change, and the idea of a so-called 'climate trigger' was one of the hardest sticking points during negotiations in the last parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister Watt says that once the laws are tabled by the end of this year, they'll go through a Senate Inquiry - a public consultation process that could slow things down.\n\n\n\n",
