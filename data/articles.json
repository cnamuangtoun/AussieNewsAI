What's next is the search and rescue operation,\" he added.\n\nIt was unclear how many people remained missing or trapped. Hong Kong leader John Lee said contact had been lost with 279 people early yesterday.\n\nAuthorities did not provide updates on the missing people or how many were still inside the ravaged buildings yesterday during a press conference.\n\nVideo showed rescuers searching in some apartments in the dark.\n\nOrange flames were still seen from inside several windows, though the whole complex was now largely a blackened ruin.\n\n\ufeffAlmost 300 people still remain unaccounted for, while at least 66 others have been hospitalised. (AP)\n\nFirefighters have been trying to control the flames since mid-afternoon on Wednesday, when the fire was believed to have started in bamboo scaffolding and construction netting and then spread across seven of the complex's eight buildings.\n\nChan said the blaze spread \"exceptionally fast\" across the towers, and emergency workers struggled to gain access inside.\n\n\"Debris and scaffolding were falling from upper floors,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"There are also other reasons like high temperature, darkness ... (and) emergency vehicle access was blocked by fallen scaffolding and debris, making our access to the building very difficult.\"\n\nMore than 70 people were injured, including 11 firefighters, as well as the 94 killed, the Fire Services Department said.\n\nAbout 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters overnight.\n\nFirst responders work the scene of a fire at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong's New Territories on Wednesday, Nov. 26 2025.

(AP Photo/Chan Long Hei)\n\nPope Leo XIV sent a telegram to Hong Kong's bishop yesterday, saying he was saddened by the fire and offering prayers for the injured, their families and emergency workers.\n\nResident Lawrence Lee was waiting for news about his wife, who he believed was still trapped in their apartment.\n\n\"When the fire started, I told her on the phone to escape. But once she left the flat, the corridor and stairs were all filled with smoke and it was all dark, so she had no choice but to go back to the flat,\" he said, as he waited in one of the shelters overnight.\n\nWinter and Sandy Chung, who lived in one of the towers, said they saw sparks fly around as they evacuated on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAlthough they were safe, they were worried about their home. \"I couldn't sleep the entire night,\" Winter Chung, 75, told The Associated Press yesterday.\n\nThe buildings sustained serious damage. (AP)\n\nFirefighters battled the blaze for hours. (AP)\n\nThree arrested on suspicion of manslaughter\n\nThree men, the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nPolice have not directly named the company where they work.\n\n\"We have reason to believe that those in charge of the construction company were grossly negligent,\" said Eileen Chung, a senior superintendent of police.\n\nPolice on Thursday also searched the office of Prestige Construction and Engineering Company, which the AP confirmed was in charge of renovations in the tower complex.\n\nPolice seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media. Phones for Prestige rang unanswered.\n\nAuthorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, allowing the unusually fast spread of the fire.\n\nPeople look on as thick smoke and flames rise during a major fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong's Tai Po district.

Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency said yesterday it was launching a probe into possible corruption relating to the renovation project.\n\nOfficials said the fire started on the external scaffolding of a 32-story tower, then spread on the bamboo scaffolding and construction netting to the inside of the building and then to the other buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.\n\nFirefighters try to extinguish a fire which broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong's New Territories, on Wednesday, November 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Chan Long Hei)\n\nBamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though Lee said officials will meet with industry representatives to discuss a switch to metal scaffolding amid safety concerns.\n\n\"While we know that bamboo scaffolding has a long history in Hong Kong, its flame retardancy is inferior to that of metal scaffolding,\" said Eric Chan, the Chief Secretary for Administration.\n\n\"For safety reasons, the government believes that a complete switch to metal scaffolding should be implemented in suitable working environments\"\n\nAuthorities will also be carrying out immediate inspections of all housing estates that are undergoing major renovation work to ensure scaffolding and construction materials meet safety standards.\n\nThe fire was the deadliest in Hong Kong in decades.\n\nIn November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a fire that lasted for around 20 hours.",

        "text": "Since Jane Edmanson first presented Gardening Australia in 1990, millions of Australians have tuned in for inspiration and advice on cultivating an oasis of their own.\n\nBut her impressive career had a slightly rocky start.\n\nAfter working as a school teacher for three years, Edmanson realised her passion actually lay with native plants, and she decided to change direction.\n\n\"In those days, plant nurseries didn't really take women,\" Edmanson says.\n\n\"They said, 'Oh no, no, we've got men here.'\"\n\nStream Gardening Australia on ABC iview Inspiring, entertaining and full of practical advice, join Costa Georgiadis and the team as they unearth gardening ideas, meet avid gardeners and look at some of the most inspiring gardens from across the country.\n\nIt was the mid-1970s, and Edmanson rang 25 different nurseries before finding one willing to give her a go.\n\nThat opportunity set her up as \"a jack of all trades\", working with everything from indoor plants to perennials, shrubs and Australian natives.\n\nAs well as working in the nursery, Edmanson went to technical college two nights a week, the start of what became a lifetime of learning about plants and gardening.\n\n\"I loved it. It was very practical. I just thought, 'This is the career for me','' she recalls.\n\nA lucky start in TV\n\nA decade later, a chance encounter became a career turning point.\n\nWhile giving an evening talk about native plants, Edmanson met pioneering ABC TV gardening presenter Kevin Heinze, who was preparing to retire from Victoria's Sow What program after more than two decades.\n\nImpressed by her knowledge and natural teaching style, Heinze offered Edmanson his hosting role.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I thought, 'Kevin don't joke with me \u2014 it's a silly joke'. But he was serious,\" she recalls.\n\n\"He wanted someone younger and a woman, so he told the ABC he had found his replacement.\n\n\" It was the luck of the draw \u2014 I was there at the right time. \"\n\nEdmanson says it's a great example of why people should have the courage to back themselves.\n\n\"Take a risk. If there's a barrier in front of you, don't be put off by it. Jump over it \u2014 you never know where it is going to lead you,\" she says.\n\nJane Edmanson's career pivot into television in 1988 (left) led her to become a founding presenter (right) on Gardening Australia. (ABC Archives)\n\nWithout any media training, Edmanson began hosting the Victorian program in 1988, kickstarting her nearly four-decade career in gardening television.\n\nNot long after, state-based gardening shows were consolidated into a national ABC program: Gardening Australia.\n\nAs a founding presenter, Edmanson joined a team of horticultural experts supporting host Peter Cundall when the show launched in 1990.\n\nNo-rules, no-worries gardening\n\nAs the show wraps up another season, Edmanson attributes its long-running success to both its audience and its enthusiastic presenters.\n\n\"It's always had a good following of people. Peter Cundall was really essential in making it. He was a real, true gardener with a great veggie garden,\" she says.\n\n\"He'd say, 'That's your bloomin' lot for the week' \u2014 he was very famous for his saying.\"\n\nGardening Australia presenters in the early 1990s: Jane Edmanson (top-left), Malcolm Campbell, Peter Cundall (bottom left), Neville Passmore, Colin Campbell and Mary Moody. (ABC Archives)\n\nBut she says the show has developed a cult following in recent years, which she credits to Costa Georgiadis's infectious enthusiasm for sustainable gardening.\n\n\"He brings a huge energy, and I admire him amazingly,\" she says.\n\n\"He brings in young people, old people and inspires community gardens.\"\n\nEdmanson shares the same \"no-rules, no-worries\" gardening philosophy as Georgiadis.\n\nEdmanson speaks with Georgiadis in her final episode of Gardening Australia this week. (ABC iview)\n\n\"We both feel it doesn't matter how you do it \u2014 it's that you actually do it,\" she says.\n\n\"Some people are born with that gardening knack, and other people are not. It's just a matter of trying, giving it a go.\"\n\nConnecting with communities\n\nAfter filming thousands of episodes, Edmanson says the stories that have stuck with her are those that allowed her to connect meaningfully with people.\n\n\"I love the people behind their garden,\" she says.\n\n\" I love hearing about the feelings they get when they get out there, and the background story of why they garden. \"\n\nShe remembers meeting a woman who grew up in Papua New Guinea, who had been volunteering at an urban farm in Melbourne.\n\n\"All she wanted to grow was sweet potato, because that's what she grew back home,\" Edmanson recalls.\n\nAnother memorable episode was when she and Georgiadis went to a market garden and met a Tamil refugee from Sri Lanka.\n\n\"He was making beautiful feasts out of the lovely ingredients that he picked freshly from the garden \u2014 it was very meaningful for him,\" she says.\n\nLoading...\n\nEdmanson says that sense of connection through gardening starts right outside her own front gate.\n\n\"People walk past my garden and peek over the picket fence, and I'll just say, 'Good morning, how are you?'\" she says.\n\n\"I'm always swapping plants \u2014 'Try this', 'Grow that'. It's amazing how gardening brings people together.\"\n\nAs one season ends, a new begins\n\nAs Edmanson hangs up her Gardening Australia hat \u2014 and the show wraps on December 5 for another year \u2014 she's adamant she's not putting her feet up any time soon.\n\n\"I don't like using that word 'retiring',\" she jokes.\n\n\"I'm moving back from Gardening Australia, but I'm still doing a lot in the horticultural industry.\"\n\nShe plans to continue volunteering at botanic gardens and sharing her passion for plants and people by giving gardening talks to community groups.\n\nFrom her fragrant garden to her worm farm, Edmanson relishes every aspect of gardening. (Supplied: David Morgan)\n\nEdmanson will continue to champion the simple act of stepping outdoors \u2014 a practice she believes reconnects us not only with each other, but with the rhythm of the seasons and the natural world around us.\n\n\"When you go out into the garden, what are the five senses you're using? You can listen to the birds. You can smell the flowers.\n\n\"It's really good for you \u2014 not just for connecting with nature, but for that sense of accomplishment.\"\n\nShe wants people to remember that \"gardening\" can mean many things: indoor plants; edible beds; fragrant flowers; or simply noticing what's changed overnight.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you dig, just so long as you get out and look at what's been happening.\"\n\nWatch Jane Edmanson's final episode of Gardening Australia tonight at 7:30pm on ABC TV or stream anytime on ABC iview.",

        "text": "When Broken Hill journalist Emily McInerney drives past her old workplace, the Barrier Daily Truth, its peeling paint and locked doors leave her feeling emotional.\n\nIt has been nearly 18 months since the independently owned newspaper abruptly closed after more than 125 years, with operators, the Barrier Industrial Council (BIC), citing financial difficulties.\n\nWhile Ms McInerney now works for a new publication established in the aftermath of the closure, she said the Truth, where she worked for about 11 years, always remained close to her heart.\n\n\"I love the building \u2026 it was very old, but it had so much history, and there were so many parts to it that you always enjoyed exploring,\" Ms McInerney said.\n\nEmily McInerney started as a cadet journalist with the then Barrier Daily Truth and worked her way up the ranks to acting editor before moving on. (ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\n\"Even being able to see the printing presses was amazing \u2026 you were watching history in action when you worked there.\"\n\nBut this printing press, along with everything else within the more than a century-old building, is now being sold or removed entirely.\n\nBIC president and Barrier Truth board chair Roslyn Ferry said a recent garage sale was the first in many steps to recoup some of its losses.\n\n\"Obviously, we were already looking at our creditors and our debtors, trying to wind up that part of the business,\" Ms Ferry said.\n\n\"So, it was decided that we would empty the building as much as possible.\"\n\nMuch of the former newspaper's still-usable equipment is being sold, with the proceeds going towards paying off creditors. (ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\nMore valuable as scrap?\n\nMs Ferry still hopes to preserve some of the building's contents, particularly the tens of thousands of printed editions archived there in varying stages of condition.\n\nAnother person interested in the paper's historical value is Gavin Schmidt, who worked there in various roles over more than 40 years, including as its manager.\n\nMr Schmidt said he understood the need to pay back the paper's creditors, but worries some items will be difficult to sell, particularly the printing press that was installed in the late 70s.\n\nFormer employee Gavin Schmidt says the paper's printing presses were kept in good condition during his time. (ABC News: Callum Marshall)\n\n\"We used to get our press serviced by a Melbourne company, [and] the guy was [telling me] presses are worth nothing because there's so many of them sitting in deserted buildings in Melbourne, Sydney, and all around the country region,\" Mr Schmidt said.\n\n\" He said the only thing they're worth is as scrap metal \u2026 that was nearly 10 years ago, and it's even worse now. \"\n\nRegional decline of in-house printing\n\nThis experience rings true for generational Mildura-based publishers, the Lanyon family, who sold their newspaper interests to national media group SA Today in September.\n\nRoss Lanyon said their print press, which once printed several mastheads, including the Sunraysia Daily and the Silver City's newest publication, the Broken Hill Times, has recently been dismantled.\n\n\"Parts of it were sold to other newspapers who acquired it, and a portion was also unfortunately sold as scrap metal because there isn't a demand for it anywhere in the world at the moment,\" he said.\n\nPresident of Country Press New South Wales and fourth-generation newsman Edward Higgins estimated \"well over 90 per cent\" of newspaper publishers have been outsourcing their printing for many years.\n\nEdward Higgins's (right) family currently produces around 20 weekly publications across country NSW and Victoria. (Supplied: Edward Higgins)\n\n\"The investment that you have to put in to have a press is significant, and staffing is also a major challenge,\" Mr Higgins said.\n\n\"The second-hand market has [also] reduced \u2026 often you can pick up the presses for not a considerable amount of money, but it's a very large investment still to install them.\"\n\nDreams of preservation\n\nMs Ferry said she was well aware of the challenge the board faces with selling the press in today's market.\n\nHowever, she said she had not ruled out exploring other options, including the possibility of preserving it as a relic of the city's history.\n\nRoslyn Ferry says some things in the building have purely historical value, such as the paper's archives. (ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\n\"The press still works, it's just totally immovable at this point, so it would be great if someone wanted to jump in and say, 'Let's use [one] part of the building as a museum,'\" she said.\n\n\"All those sorts of decisions will be totally up to the affiliated unions, [so] probably nothing's going to be happening in the next year or two, but we'll see how we go.\"",

        "text": "Monash IVF will have a greater obligation to check the biological origin of embryos following highly-publicised mix-ups, under conditions imposed by Victoria's health regulator.\n\nThe Victorian Health Regulator has announced it is imposing conditions on Monash IVF's registration following the bungles in Brisbane and Melbourne.\n\nIn April, the fertility group apologised after a patient unknowingly gave birth to a stranger's baby after the wrong embryo was transferred.\n\nJust two months later it was revealed Monash IVF incorrectly transferred the wrong embryo into a patient in Melbourne.\n\nThe bungle in Victoria prompted an investigation by the Victorian Health Regulator, which conducted site inspections at Monash IVF facilities and spoke with staff.\n\nThe regulator said it has now imposed conditions on Monash IVF's registration to ensure there was no repeat.\n\n\"The conditions focus on matters such as ensuring the integrity and traceability of genetic material through comprehensive consent and documentation processes, rigorous verification and patient checks, accurate recording in management systems, and strengthened staff capability,\" the regulator said.\n\nMonash IVF has apologised for embryo mix-ups in Brisbane and Melbourne.

        "text": "More a shot across the bows than a direct hit to the engine room.\n\nJohn Lonsdale, the banking industry regulator's big kahuna, has finally taken aim at the Australian economy's biggest threat \u2014 an overheated property market that once again is accelerating.\n\nLoading...\n\nCritics have variously described the new lending restrictions as a wet lettuce or damp squib.\n\nProblem loans, they argue, are nowhere near the level of the soon-to-be-imposed limits. So, there's unlikely to be any immediate flow through to property prices.\n\nIt's difficult to argue otherwise, especially if the numbers are averaged across the industry.\n\nBut loans to property investors are growing at an alarming clip, now making up more than 40 per cent of all new loans.\n\nAnd given some banks are far more aggressive than others, it doesn't take too much for things to get out of hand.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) made a similar move back in 2014 with limited success.\n\nBut three years later, it specifically took aim at investors and engineered a significant drop in housing prices before the pandemic hit.\n\nHome loan caps coming The banking regulator will impose restrictions on home loans from early next year to limit the number of \"high-risk\" large loans being issued to customers.\n\nThe move also highlights two important issues.\n\nThe first is that all our financial regulators, from Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and APRA to the Reserve Bank, are actively eyeing off potential threats to the economy.\n\nAnd, more importantly, it perfectly illustrates why economic management across the developed world has been largely removed from government.\n\nOur housing price bubble has been ably assisted by governments stretching back more than half a century.\n\nTax incentives to invest in property and to then limit taxes on the capital gains have directed much of our savings into merely putting a roof over our heads.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhile we delude ourselves each year into believing those reports about the enormous growth in Australian household wealth \u2014 driven mostly by hugely expensive housing values \u2014 we rarely look on the other side of the ledger.\n\nThat's where close to $3.3 trillion worth of debt is sitting, overwhelmingly driven by enormous mortgages.\n\nAustralian household debt is among the highest in the world.\n\nThat poses a potential threat to our financial stability, limiting the Reserve Bank's ability to cut interest rates.\n\nThat is why APRA is acting, even if ever so meekly.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe never-ending boom\n\nIt's been called a bubble for more than 15 years. But the great Aussie housing price boom has barely skipped a beat in the intervening years.\n\nIt's outrun a global financial crisis, a pandemic that brought the global economy to a halt, and kept on rolling even through the most punishing rate-hiking program in history.\n\nHuge population growth propelled by a large rise in immigration and large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus have driven the momentum.\n\nOver the years, the debate has shifted.\n\nThe bubble fears \u2014 and the threat that poses to the broader economy \u2014 have been overtaken by concerns about affordability and the potential shift in Australian society that beckons.\n\nForget AI. Here's a real Aussie bubble Amid global warnings of impending financial doom, APRA and the Reserve Bank are far more concerned about a home-grown bubble, one that's been taking in oxygen for almost three decades.\n\nOnly those born into a household with property will likely ever end up owning one themselves, widening a wealth chasm that threatens to fundamentally change the way Australians see themselves.\n\nAttempts to reform the system have been political suicide.\n\nBill Shorten came to grief in 2019 with his proposal to wind back the generous tax concessions for property investors and no-one has been game to touch it since.\n\nInstead, our political leaders resort to policies that throw cash at the problem, making a dire situation even worse.\n\nIn addition to endless first home buyers' schemes, there have been repeated calls to give first home buyers access to their superannuation for a deposit.\n\nEven APRA has come under pressure to abandon or decrease its mortgage serviceability buffers.\n\nThese were implemented to specifically limit risky lending by ensuring borrowers could repay loans if rates suddenly rose.\n\nNational home prices have continued to climb over 2025. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts)\n\nPulling on the handbrake\n\nOur banks have grown fat on the back of the housing boom. And they would very much like it to continue.\n\nMortgage lending is far and away the biggest money spinner among our big banks.\n\nThe biggest, Commonwealth Bank, now holds around a quarter of all home loans across the country.\n\nWorth more than $600 billion, that's a huge exposure to one sector at just one institution.\n\nLoading\n\nNot that there are any signs of imminent trouble.\n\nOur banking system sailed almost unscathed through the worst inflationary bout in 50 years, which backed straight into a cost-of-living crisis and an incredibly steep rate-hiking cycle.\n\nDespite all that, default rates remain incredibly low, a little over 1.1 per cent, and are trending down as three rate cuts have delivered welcome relief to strained household budgets.\n\nBuying a home has never been harder Home prices have risen by almost 50 per cent in the past five years, pushing housing affordability to its worst levels on records, a new report has found.\n\nThat's largely thanks to unexpectedly strong labour markets, which kept Australians in work during the past few years even as interest rates soared.\n\nAPRA clearly is concerned that may not always be the case, given the sudden growth in investor loans and a property market on a tear, combined with a potentially weakening economy.\n\nFormer prime minister John Howard once famously quipped that he never had a home owner complain to him about rising house prices.\n\nIt's now a major cause of political division amid a roiling undercurrent of social dissent.",

        "text": "Super Netball could have two additional teams by 2027, with Netball Australia (NA) calling for expressions of interest to expand the competition.\n\nThe league is currently operating with eight teams, with the Melbourne Mavericks the most recent to join the competition last year.\n\nThe Mavericks effectively replaced Collingwood, who handed back their licence at the end of the 2023 season after seven years.\n\nBut with more international players joining the world's strongest league and demand from Australian players and fans growing, NA is also keen to keep rival competitions like the AFLW from raiding the talent pool.\n\nJo Weston (right) celebrates with her Melbourne Vixens teammates after winning the 2025 Super Netball title. (AAP: Joel Carrett)\n\nThe NA board has not approved expansion, but it has \"formally endorsed the strategic intent to explore and evaluate opportunities for growth\" and is expected to sign off.\n\nThe governing body announced they were inviting expressions of interest (EOI) from qualified organisations and consortia seeking to secure a new team owner licence.\n\nThis follows the release of a 10-year strategic plan this week to entrench Super Netball as Australia's most popular women's sports league and have the Diamonds become the most-recognised national women's sports team.\n\nWhen the Mavericks, owned by media mogul Craig Hutchison's Sport Entertainment Network, won the last bid, Netball Victoria had made a submission for the eighth licence for a regional-based team in the state's western corridor in Geelong, Ballarat or Bendigo.\n\nNetball Tasmania has also previously signalled interest in joining Super Netball.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nNetball Australia boss Stacey West said the EOI process reflected the ambition of the sport, which had record-breaking attendance at games this season, including a sold-out grand final crowd of more than 15,000.\n\n\"The Super Netball League has never been stronger \u2026 it is clear the league has grown significantly over the past decade,\" West said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"As we look toward the next era, it is vital that any expansion is strategic, sustainable and aligned with the long-term vision of Australian netball.\n\n\"Investing in women's sport presents a dynamic space for innovation, growth and purpose, and we look forward to engaging with interested parties as we consider the next stage of evolution for [Super Netball].\"\n\nAAP",

        "text": "When residents of the north-west Victorian town of Ouyen stop by their local pharmacy, they know they are getting much more than just their prescription filled.\n\nThe pharmacy is a one-stop shop for not only medical supplies, but community connection and advice that can save lives.\n\nOwner Alex Look, 34, has become a familiar face in the town of about 1,000 people since purchasing the pharmacy in 2021.\n\nHe said the relationship between community pharmacists and their patients was not just transactional, but often \"unique and special\".\n\n\"Sometimes that's very rewarding because we can see the journey that people make throughout their life, but also it can be quite challenging because people sometimes come to us in times of crisis and times of need,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact that they can come in at any time without an appointment and discuss a wide range of issues, joys and troubles, at the same time, it's really powerful.\"\n\nAlex Look says the relationship between pharmacists and patients is \"unique\". (Supplied: Ouyen Pharmacy)\n\nIn early November, Mr Look was awarded International Pharmacist of the Year by the Pharmacy Innovation Assembly in Melbourne.\n\nThe award recognises pharmacists from diverse backgrounds who are making meaningful and lasting impacts on the profession.\n\nMr Look said it was an honour to be recognised for his contribution to the community, which he believed should receive the same level of healthcare as any in the city.\n\n\"We shouldn't be second class citizens just because we live in a rural town; we deserve access to high quality medications and care,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why we're fighting for our patients and our community for all these different services that we can offer to make it more accessible because we know it's difficult living in country towns.\n\n\"We want to be able to be the solution.\"\n\nIncreasing vaccination access\n\nEarlier in the year, Mr Look introduced Q Fever vaccination services to the pharmacy.\n\nQ Fever is a disease caused by bacteria, which spreads from cattle, sheep and goats, as well as other domestic and wild animals, to humans.\n\nAlex Look with farmer Linton Hahnel at the the Ouyen Livestock Exchange. (Supplied: Ouyen Pharmacy)\n\nMr Look said accessing the vaccination had been difficult for people in Ouyen, which is known for its grain and livestock farming.\n\n\"We were getting a lot of inquiries from people in the community and within hundreds of kilometres away saying they can't access this vaccination very readily,\" he said.\n\n\"The reason for that is it is a multi-step process requiring blood tests, skin tests and then the vaccination itself.\n\n\" A lot of people were requiring this, and they just weren't getting the vaccination done. \"\n\nAlex Look is a much-loved member of the Ouyen community. (Supplied: Ouyen Pharmacy)\n\nNow farmers do not have to travel further than Ouyen to access the service.\n\n\"We're actually saving patients approximately six to seven hours at least per course of vaccination,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been really helpful for our local community.\"\n\nOuyen Inc co-chair Jason Wills said Mr Look had been a strong advocate for the town, continually pushing for health equity.\n\n\"He really cares about people and he's showing that with all the services that he's offering out of the pharmacy,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a huge thing in small towns for people to know that people are out there helping them.\"\n\nInnovative approach\n\nPharmacy Innovation Assembly founder Ann Coo said Mr Look was selected from over 100 nominations due to his \"exceptional\" repertoire and his care for the community.\n\n\"You can see on his socials he is very active, and he really connects with the patients on a personal level rather than just seeing that patient as someone that walks in your door,\" she said.\n\n\"He really goes that extra mile in saying 'what does the community need and how can I treat my patients better' \u2026 that is who Alex is.\"\n\nAnn Coo says Alex Look goes above and beyond for his patients. (Supplied: Pharmacy Innovation Assembly)\n\nMr Look is also a Justice of the Peace, has been involved in Ouyen Inc, runs a food van and offers delivery services for patients.\n\nMs Coo said Mr Look's introduction of the Q Fever vaccination had really stood out to the assembly.\n\n\"That is a major contribution to local healthcare, it's not very usual practice for a pharmacist to do that,\" Ms Coo said.\n\nPositive move to the regions\n\nBefore moving to Ouyen, Mr Look had worked in various locations, including in Western Australia, Queensland, Broken Hill, and Mildura.\n\nHe said moving to Ouyen was the \"best decision\" he had ever made and the community's drive inspired him.\n\n\"I think that often pharmacists or people in general have some concerns about going to small towns about what they can do or making friends or whatnot,\" he said.\n\n\"But in fact, my experience has been incredible and even as a person of diverse background \u2026 I've had nothing but positive experiences.\"\n\nAlex Look and Alexandra Lynn service the rural town of about 1,100 people. (Supplied: Phil Down)\n\nMr Wills said the town was lucky to have Mr Look as a part of the community.\n\n\"He's putting his own time and money into the town, the pharmacy, and that's not his only business; he has a food van as well,\" he said.\n\n\"He puts himself out there, he calls this place his home and we really appreciate that.\"",

(ABC Capricornia: Katrina Beavan)\n\nKLC objected to every expedited case and after three years of negotiations, in 2025, FMG had withdrawn from about 90 of the licence applications.\n\n\"The state government is pushing the responsibility [to challenge cases] back onto traditional owners and also the land councils \u2026 and that is onerous and traumatic,\" Mr Garstone said.\n\n\"We've collected enough evidence now for a strong case to prove the use of expedited procedure has been inappropriately applied.\"\n\nThe appeal comes as the WA Law Society said the government's new State Development Bill gave Premier and State Development Minister Roger Cook \"extraordinary powers to override\" conventional environmental protection safeguards.\n\nThe State Development Bill is before the Legislative Council of Western Australia.\n\n'Disrespectful and counter-productive'\n\nWalalakoo Aboriginal Corporation executive chairperson Robert Watson said the expedited procedure created legal conflict and harmed cultural authority.\n\nRobert Watson says the current system makes shortcuts around traditional owners rights.

        "text": "Fuzzy Zoeller, a two-time major champion and one of golf's most gregarious characters whose career was tainted by a racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods, has died aged 74.\n\nA cause of death was not immediately available. Brian Naugle, the tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston, said Zoeller's daughter called him Thursday with the news.\n\nZoeller was the last player to win the Masters on his first attempt, a three-man playoff in 1979.\n\nIn the 1984 US Open at Winged Foot, Zoeller famously waved a white towel when he thought Greg Norman had beat him, only to defeat Norman in an 18-hole playoff the next day.\n\nBut it was the 1997 Masters that changed his popularity.\n\nWoods was on his way to a watershed moment in golf with the most dominant victory in Augusta National history.\n\nZoeller had finished his round and had a drink in hand under the oak tree by the clubhouse when he was stopped by CNN and asked for his thoughts on 21-year-old Woods.\n\n\"That little boy is driving well and he's putting well. He's doing everything it takes to win. So, you know what you guys do when he gets in here? You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not serve fried chicken next year. Got it?,\" Zoeller said.\n\nThe Champions Dinner, where the defending Masters champion chooses the menu, is traditionally held on Tuesday at Augusta National, two days before the opening round.\n\nHe smiled and snapped his fingers, and as he was walking away he turned and said, \"Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve\".\n\nThat moment haunted him the rest of his career.\n\nZoeller apologised. Woods was travelling and it took two weeks for him to comment as the controversy festered. Zoeller later said he received death threats for years after that moment.\n\nWriting for Golf Digest in 2008, he said it was \"the worst thing I've gone through in my entire life\".\n\n\"If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I'm here to tell you they got their way,\" Zoeller wrote.\n\n\"I've cried many times. I've apologised countless times for words said in jest that just aren't a reflection of who I am. I have hundreds of friends, including people of colour, who will attest to that.\n\n\"Still, I've come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.\"\n\nIt marred a career filled with two famous major titles, eight other PGA Tour titles and a Senior PGA Championship among his two PGA Tour Champions titles.\n\nMore than winning was how he went about it. Zoeller played fast and still had an easygoing nature to the way he approached the game, often whistling between shots.\n\nHe made his Masters debut in 1979 and got into a three-way playoff when Ed Sneed bogeyed the last three holes. Zoeller defeated Sneed and Tom Watson with a birdie on the second playoff hole, flinging his putter high in the air.\n\n\"I've never been to heaven, and thinking back on my life, I probably won't get a chance to go,\" Zoeller once said.\n\n\"I guess winning the Masters is as close as I'm going to get.\"\n\nZoeller was locked in a duel with Norman at Winged Foot in the 1984 US Open, playing in the group behind and watching Norman make putt after putt. So when he saw Norman make a 40-footer on the 18th, he assumed it was for birdie and began waving a white towel in a moment of sportsmanship.\n\nOnly later did he realise it was for par, and Zoeller made par to force a playoff. Zoeller beat him by eight shots in the 18-hole playoff (67-75). Zoeller's lone regret was giving the towel to a kid after he finished in regulation.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\n\"If you happen to see a grungy white towel hanging around, get it for me, will you?\" he once said.\n\nHe was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr in New Albany, Indiana.\n\nZoeller said his father was known only as \"Fuzzy\" and he was given the same name. He played at a junior college in Florida before joining the powerful Houston golf team before turning pro.\n\nZoeller was awarded the Bob Jones Award by the USGA in 1985, the organisation's highest honour given for distinguished sportsmanship.\n\nAP/Reuters",

Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe repeal, supported by the Minns government, the Liberals, the Greens and a number of independents, means that future decisions on feral horse management in Kosciuszko National Park can be made in the same way as other feral management decisions in other national parks.\n\nThe Kosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act 2018 was spearheaded by former NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro during the former Coalition government, and required the population of feral horses to be maintained at no less than 3000 in certain retention areas of the park. The rationale was that the presence of the horses, also called brumbies, in the Snowy Mountains landscape was considered part of Australia\u2019s colonial heritage.\n\nHowever, the feral horses also damaged the delicate Alpine ecosystems of the High Country on the NSW-Victorian border and put native species at threat.\n\nLoading\n\nThe population of 3000 wild horses will be maintained until mid-2027 when the current statutory management plan for the national park expires.\n\nNSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe said this was a landmark decision by a cross-party group to protect the state\u2019s only alpine national park.\n\n\u201cI have visited Kosciuszko National Park and clearly seen that control of wild horses is enabling the natural ecosystem to bounce back,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cThis bill will ensure that horses are treated the same way as other invasive species in NSW national parks.\u201d\n\nBe the first to know when major news happens.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Luke McQueen once sold out a theatre in Edinburgh by telling a big lie: he promoted the show as a gig by the hugely popular Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle. When McQueen, who bears no resemblance to Boyle, sidled onto the stage, he was met by stunned silence. \u201cEr, Frankie Boyle\u2019s not coming,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, Luke McQueen. Give me a cheer if you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d No one cheered. The only sound was the scraping of chairs as people stood up and headed for the exit. One enraged punter kicked McQueen\u2019s collection bucket across the stage on his way out. \u201cGuys, don\u2019t go. I\u2019m funny,\u201d pleaded the man on stage. Deliberately upsetting a crowd of Frankie Boyle fans would make most people nervous, but McQueen isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI thought the whole thing was so exciting,\u201d he says of the 2014 gig. \u201cThe thing I love more than anything is committing to an idea.\u201d The bogus Frankie Boyle show is typical of McQueen\u2019s highly conceptual approach to comedy. His work often starts with a palpable truth \u2013 in this case, the fact it\u2019s extremely hard to sell tickets to Edinburgh shows that don\u2019t feature big names \u2013 before spinning off into the realms of pure imagination. The McQueen who walked out on stage and told the audience they weren\u2019t going to see Frankie Boyle was a character; his attempt to turn confusion and disappointment into comedy was the performance. \u201cI was originally going to tell people they were going to see a gig by Ricky Gervais,\u201d admits McQueen when I meet him at a theatre in London\u2019s Soho. \u201cI emailed Ricky and said \u2018I\u2019ve had this idea \u2013 do you mind if I do it?\u2019 He replied that he thought it was really funny, but he couldn\u2019t say yes because he couldn\u2019t knowingly upset his fans. Which is totally fair. So, I used Frankie Boyle without asking.\u201d Another example of comedic identity theft from McQueen\u2019s oeuvre is a performance in which he claimed (entirely fictitiously) to be the former stage partner of the English comedian Jack Whitehall. McQueen professed to be so embittered at being usurped by Whitehall\u2019s dad, he\u2019d written an entire show about it. There is video footage of Whitehall walking on stage during a performance of the show in Edinburgh, an incident McQueen insists was not staged. McQueen says his comedy often plays with notions of likeability. Unlikeability might be a better description. There\u2019s a video of him shaving his head in the middle of a crowded ice rink, an act of atonement designed to win back an ex-girlfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe once poured a can of soup on his head in front of a Van Gogh at London\u2019s National Gallery in a parody of the Just Stop Oil protests and he\u2019s staged a fake reality show called The Luke of Love, offering a group of unsuspecting female contestants the chance to date him. The perplexed women were hooked up to a polygraph machine and asked questions such as: \u201cDo you know where my biological mother is?\u201d In every case, he insists he was firmly in character. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do this kind of thing as me,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIt would be obnoxious.\u201d He\u2019s very much in character \u2013 albeit a character who happens to be a comedian called Luke McQueen \u2013 in the show he\u2019s bringing to next year\u2019s Melbourne International Comedy Festival. It\u2019s called Luke McQueen: Comedian\u2019s Comedian, and it takes some explaining. Loading The title refers to a popular podcast hosted by an English comedian called Stuart Goldsmith. Since the first episode was recorded in 2012, hundreds of guests \u2013 a who\u2019s-who of hilarity ranging from Jimmy Carr and Tim Minchin to Stewart Lee and Katherine Ryan \u2013 have discussed the serious business of making people laugh. One person who has never been asked to appear is ... Luke McQueen. Furious at being ignored, McQueen phones Goldsmith and demands to know why he\u2019s been snubbed. A recording of their toe-curling conversation \u2013 which ends with Goldsmith hanging up the phone \u2013 is played at the start of the show. McQueen runs the recording through an AI voice generator and clones the podcast host\u2019s voice. Like a malignant ventriloquist, he has acquired the ability to put words in his nemesis\u2019s mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Goldsmith represented on stage by a shop mannequin topped with a disturbing homemade head, McQueen sets about staging his own edition of Comedian\u2019s Comedian. At first, things go to plan. McQueen, a preening figure in a brown suit, answers a series of fawning questions he\u2019s written himself. \u201cYou\u2019re largely regarded as one of the most innovative comedians in the world,\u201d says AI Goldsmith. \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d \u201cBored,\u201d sniffs McQueen, running a hand through his lustrous hair. Halfway through the show, things take a dark turn. The AI \u2013 which everyone knows can\u2019t be trusted \u2013 malfunctions. The questions go off script; they become hostile and deeply personal. What follows is an unhinged, brutally funny journey into the darkest corners of McQueen\u2019s psyche as he\u2019s eviscerated by his algorithmic interlocutor. As ever, it\u2019s hard to discern how much of the show is real. Was Goldsmith in on the joke all along? McQueen ponders the question, then replies, \u201cYou\u2019ll think this is a lie, but I swear it\u2019s the truth: I simply don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke McQueen outside the BBC in 2018, protesting against the airing of his show The Luke McQueen Pilots. Credit: PA Images via Getty Images He\u2019s just as evasive when I ask him what happened when Goldsmith attended a performance of the show in Edinburgh. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ruffle those feathers,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful.\u201d While McQueen is happy to discuss his comedy, he hands-down refuses to talk about himself. Requests for basic biographical details are met with silence. \u201cI expect I\u2019ll regret this interview because I don\u2019t like being myself in public,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cMy personal life is not anyone\u2019s business. The only thing you need to know about me is my work.\u201d He smiles apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be difficult. I don\u2019t mind if you know my age or where I was born. But I also think \u2019why do I have to tell you?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an age when relentless self-promotion is the norm for entertainers seeking to connect with their audience, this is an unusual stance, to say the least. But McQueen is something of a digital ghost. Wikipedia has yet to discover him, he ditched most of his social media accounts during the pandemic and there are no interviews in which he sheds light on anything relating to his personal life. Under pressure, he reveals that he studied performing arts at the University of Bedfordshire, where an inspirational tutor encouraged him to see comedy as a gateway to acting. \u201cWhen I started, I genuinely didn\u2019t know much about comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cRicky Gervais was probably the most alternative comedian I knew. Obviously, I\u2019m friends with a lot of comedians now and a lot of them are comedy nerds. They love it. But even now I\u2019m not a super fan.\u201d Luke McQueen says he\u2019s \u201cnot a super fan\u201d of comedy. At times, he admits, comedy has felt like a straitjacket. He\u2019d love to do more acting and directing, but it can be difficult breaking free of the festival circuit and the exhausting demands of writing and performing a new comedy show every couple of years. Producers and commissioners can have a blinkered view of performers and often want facsimiles of successful shows. \u201cI think repetition is the most disgusting thing in terms of creativity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that we need to find something that\u2019s like something that\u2019s come before is pathetic.\u201d His persona in Luke McQueen: Comedian\u2019s Comedian \u2013 a fragile, thin-skinned man who responds to rejection by turning his impotent rage on a podcast host \u2013 is not entirely fictitious. \u201cI play with the truth, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any truth in it,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the character\u2019s arrogance and bravado is like me screaming at the industry \u2018what is your problem?\u2019\u201d He is, by his own admission, still trying to make it. He\u2019s brimming with ideas for films, TV shows and stage productions, but acknowledges it\u2019s tough standing out from the crowd. \u201cThere\u2019s loads more that I want to do in this world, but I don\u2019t know if I ever will,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement",

What does that say about the future of spin bowling in Australia? And what does it say that Joe Root\u2019s part-time off-spin is all England think they need? Joe Root took 0-12 from one over in the first Test in Perth. Credit: Getty Images \u201cJoe Root as your national team spin bowler would make anyone who cares about cricket cry. It\u2019s so totally embarrassing,\u201d MacGill says. \u201cHow haven\u2019t they cultivated other spinners? \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a good enough job developing our own spin bowlers.\u201d\n\nShane Warne was spin bowling\u2019s most powerful advocate, always spruiking the value of having a slow bowler in an XI. His presence is missed by tweakers everywhere. \u201cShane Warne would be turning in his grave,\u201d says ex-Australian leg-spinner Kerry O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cHe\u2019d just be teeing off, wouldn\u2019t he? Former Australian cricketer Stuart MacGill. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWarnie contends \u2013 and it\u2019s fair \u2013 that if it seams, it spins. It sounds like a clich\u00e9, but when it seams, matches end early. \u201cIs it now just marking time on Australian pitches and waiting for the trips to the subcontinent? That can disillusion young spinners on the way up that they\u2019re only going to play in certain parts of the world.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Lyon bowled 122.4 overs \u2013 the fewest he has sent down in a home campaign in his career. There is every chance Lyon plays a pivotal role in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. But if Australia\u2019s greatest off-spinner isn\u2019t even guaranteed a game \u2013 or bowling fewer overs \u2013 what does that mean for a craft already under siege as Australian pitches offer more for the quicks? Lyon spoke about the issue in August. \u201cI know how important spin bowling is, but there is a degree of me that\u2019s concerned about spin bowling around the world, not just Australia, with the wickets we\u2019re playing on,\u201d Lyon said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at spin bowling and your younger spin bowlers around the country, they\u2019re not getting the overs or the opportunities to bowl on day-three, day-four wickets, or spinning wickets, or even green seamers because the fast bowlers are dominating.\u201d O\u2019Keeffe understands where Lyon is coming from. \u201cHe was such a big part of home campaigns and now every pitch they play on affords sideways movement for the quicker bowlers and it lasts most of the match,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe says. \u201cNine wickets for Lyon last summer in a winning series against India is bittersweet.\u201d Former Test spinner Stephen O\u2019Keefe, who took 301 first-class wickets at 24.66, remains bullish about Australia\u2019s depth but concedes Lyon\u2019s situation could disillusion some.\n\n\u201cDomestically, I think we\u2019re in the strongest position we\u2019ve been in a long time in terms of depth,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says. \u201cMitch Swepson, Tanveer Sangha, Corey Rocchiccioli, Todd Murphy, Ben Manenti and Matt Kuhnemann are there, and I think all of them have the potential to play for Australia. The hard part is when they look up and don\u2019t see a spinner playing. \u201cI\u2019m picking a spinner every day of the week, even in this pink ball game. Steve O\u2019Keefe celebrates one of his 12 wickets during the 2017 Test in Pune. Credit: AP \u201cIf Nathan doesn\u2019t play at the Gabba and bowls two overs in Perth, I think is really worrisome for domestic spinners. Five Tests, and you don\u2019t need a spinner for two? That would be so disappointing. \u201cMaybe do what Beau Webster did. Stop bowling offies and take up medium pace. That might be the shortest path into the Australian team because that seems more effective. In Australia, it is quite tough, so we need to judge our spinners a little differently.\u201d\n\nIt is expected England will only double down with the bat in Brisbane. Even at 2-0 down, Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum won\u2019t deviate from their aggressive method. Lyon loves bowling on day-five pitches, but unless Australia\u2019s batters pile on runs, that scenario may not materialise this series. \u201cI think Bazball, if anything, increase his chances of playing,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says. \u201cThey may go hard at him, but in Australia he\u2019s one of the hardest spinners to attack on bigger grounds. I\u2019m backing him as a weapon. He\u2019s just as effective to break a partnership or knock over one of their top order batters as much as Scotty Boland is.\u201d Both Kerry O\u2019Keeffe and MacGill have an eye on the future. They are excited by young Sydney leg-spinner Tom Brooks, who took 6-44 for NSW\u2019s second XI this week against Tasmania and bowls \u201cbig ripping leg breaks\u201d. But Lyon\u2019s predicament could have a ripple effect in the years to come.",

In 1970-71, a washed-out Melbourne Test was replaced by what turned out to be the first one-day international. Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith on the way to the course in January last year. Credit: Getty Images More than 46,000 spectators got to see some cricket, and in a speech at the end of the one-dayer Sir Donald Bradman said: \u201cYou have seen history made.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wrong. The lesser-known story was that England\u2019s captain Ray Illingworth was furious the match was scheduled without consultation and angry that a seventh Test was added to the series.\n\nHe was less furious when England, by winning that seventh game, recovered the Ashes in Australia for the first time since Bodyline. In December 1978, I was at a World Series Cricket day-night game in Sydney that was over before the dinner break. The West Indies were all out for 66 in 33.4 overs, and Australia knocked off the target in the 19th. Instead of going home without having seen the new SCG lights come on, we were treated to a second match. The teams came out in coloured uniforms for the first time: Australia in canary yellow, the West Indies in coral pink. Three weeks later, the coloured clothing was worn in a scheduled match. Nobody remembers the result of the extra game, but that wasn\u2019t the point. The Packer organisation put the fans first. And the players seemed happy enough to play more cricket.\n\nThe implausibility of this happening in Perth, or even being seriously considered, says a lot about today\u2019s approach to the game. Workloads, or their lack of, have to be micromanaged. Superb golf courses have to be played. Fans have to be ignored. There are probably contractual prohibitions on anything spontaneous taking place after the rigours of a Test lasting 141 overs \u2013 not two days, but a day and a half. I\u2019m reluctant to join the pile-on against England, who, until the last quarter in Perth, appeared likely to win. If they turn around and win in Brisbane, or win the Ashes, there will be enough egg on enough distinguished faces to go around. But it\u2019s hard to get around the absence of cricket in their preparation and what it says about how they view the game. They have scheduled extra net sessions in Brisbane, which is all very well if efficiency comes first: have a bowl, have a hit, get away for 18 holes.\n\nIt leaves out the rhythmic demands of playing actual games of actual cricket: the hours spent waiting to bat or ruing what you\u2019ve done to get out; the hours in the field; the hours of doing\n\nnothing. England \u2013 and Australia too \u2013 are preparing for a game that swings on sudden bursts of energy, wickets falling in clumps, one explosive innings, a match decided in a session or even a few overs. It\u2019s exciting to watch if you have a short attention span. It also looks like a self-fulfilling system of shortcuts. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised at the frankly atrocious standard of batting in Perth: it was what the teams practised for. And England practised much more intently for it than Australia did. So we go on to Brisbane, where fans will hope they aren\u2019t dudded like those in Perth. You really worry for those English tourists who have booked tickets for both.\n\nMuch focus has been placed, rightly, on England\u2019s batting, but presumably they will be able to catch lightning in a bottle at some point and pile up a match-winning total in quick time or, better still, no time. I thought their bowling should cause them real worry. Mark Wood, who had not played a game since February, was spent after eight overs in the first innings. Jofra Archer and the England attack fatigued quickly in Perth. Credit: Getty Images Jofra Archer was good for a Twenty20 spell with the new ball on the Friday, but that pretty much did it for him. The lack of endurance should come as no surprise when the preparation consists of eliminating endurance in favour of efficient little bursts.\n\nAfter the match, Wood considered driving from Perth to Brisbane until he found out that it might last five days. Loading If we get another abbreviated Test in Brisbane, whichever way it goes, the question must be asked more directly: do these players owe their fans more than lip service? Ought a limited-overs match be staged on the missing day three or four? Nervous players and management tend only to see potential downsides: injuries, giving away their secrets, more damned cricket. But as the 1971 and 1978 experiences showed, impromptu games delivered long-suffering spectators a measure of respect. A contract between players and fans existed.",

        "text": "If that unbelievable holiday bargain or too-perfect TikTok find seems tempting, experts suggest to pause and think.\n\n\n\n\n\nScammers hit Australians hard during holiday seasons, with one in five reporting being scammed at least once in this time, according to a recent report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, these Australians have lost $445 during the holiday season, with 4 per cent of victims losing more than $5,000, according to the new findings from cybersecurity firm McAfee, which analysed data from October to early November.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company also sells cybersecurity products.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the numbers might get worse, as 89 per cent of Australians have reported that ads from unfamiliar retailers are exposing them to more scams and fake websites.\n\n\n\nScams to watch\n\nMcAfee highlights four main holiday scams: fake retail websites and counterfeit deal pages, scams on TikTok and social media, delivery and shipping text frauds, and gift card and account verification scams.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline brand impersonation is another type of scam that targets online shoppers, in which scammers copy a brand's identity to deceive customers.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The new 'widespread' scam to watch out for this Black Friday\n\nMcAfee's survey of Australians shows 36 per cent have abandoned a purchase because something didn\u2019t feel right.\n\n\n\n\n\nFake versions of these sites frequently feature stolen product images, similar design layouts, authentic-sounding customer service language, and holiday sale graphics designed to encourage shoppers to enter payment details, according to the cybersecurity firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report shows the most impersonated luxury brands are Coach, Dior, Ralph Lauren, Rolex, and Gucci, while the most impersonated mainstream brands are Apple, Nintendo, Samsung, Disney, and Steam.\n\n\n\n'Most believable tricks we\u2019ve ever seen'\n\nThese scams are becoming more convincing as artificial intelligence advances.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to last year, 60 per cent of Australians are now more worried about AI scams, and 38 per cent reported they or someone they know has \"encountered holiday-sale scams that use deepfakes or fake celebrity endorsements\".\n\n\n\n\"Scammers have always taken advantage of the holiday rush to exploit people looking for deals,\" Tyler McGee, head of the Asia-Pacific and Japan region at McAfee, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But AI has made it easier for them to copy trusted brands with speed and accuracy that is hard to spot.\"\n\n\n\nHow to spot online scams\n\nBut there are still tips that can help shoppers avoid being scammed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Scamwatch, if an offer is too good to be true, that might be a sign of a potential scam, and if the seller lacks terms and conditions, an ABN, or a privacy policy on their website, you should be cautious.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAfee also warns that pressure to act quickly, requests for payment through gift cards or wire transfers, requests for personal information, or insisting that you stay on the line or remain silent are all \"classic scam signals\".\n\n\n\n",

That really leaves me with a heavy heart, and I apologize for all the hurt that that will cause other people I really do.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen says Australia will need additional work in order to meet the 2035 target.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has set a national target to reduce emission by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and 62 to 70 per cent by 2035.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bowen says while Australia is on track to achieve the 2030 target in budget term, but the government projects that additional work will be needed to get to the 2035 goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's normal for there to be a gap between projected emission and a target ten years into the future. That's why you set a target, and as new policies are now developed and implemented, emissions outlook improves, that's what a target is for, it drives new initiatives and work.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley has accused Labor and the Greens of making what she calls a dirty deal, after the two parties reached a consensus to pass the environmental law this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Ley says the bill will push energy prices up and accuses Labor of making the cost of living worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is very clear from the reaction so far to the dirty deal done by the Labor party with the Greens, a deal that wasn't necessary to conclude today or this year, what is absolutely clear is that this is going to put energy prices up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAngie Bell, the Opposition's environment spokesperson, says the bill will deliver more red tape for energy producers, and says it will not just have impacts on gas and electricity prices, but also jobs and productivity.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nA bystander has been praised by police for saving the life of a swimmer who was attacked by a shark in New South Wales mid north coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo swimmers, a man and a woman, were attacked by the shark on Thursday morning [[November 27]]. The woman died before paramedics arrived at the scene, and the man has suffered from serious injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Superintendent Joshua Smyth says a witness of the attack has played key role in saving the swimmer's life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important to know that a very good bystander's first aid was administered to the male patient, she made a tourniquet on the male's leg, obviously potentially save the male patient, allow paramedics to get there and render further medical aid.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales emergency services have received over 2000 calls for assistance due to the severe thunderstorms overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state's central west and Western Sydney were hit by heavy rainfalls and strong winds yesterday, leading several communities to power outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SES Spokesperson says there were around 100 volunteers working in the impacted areas in Blacktown and Paramatta, which received over 1000 calls for assistance last night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Central West, we did receive a surge of calls across Belfast, Orange and Dubbo, significant property damage was experienced in Nvertire, where the entire roofs were blown off homes and sheds. And in those area, we are gonna expect clean up to take several days.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA heatwave warning is in place across the state till November 29.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport now and in football, Liverpool has hit a low, with a four to one defeat by PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool has lost nine of their last 12 games across all competitions, dropping to 12th place on the ladder on nine points.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the win, PSV climbed to 14th in the Champions League table, with eight points.\n\n\n\n\n\nReds manager, Arne Slot, shared his shock at the home ground loss - the first in the past 14 games the side has playerd at Anfield.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlot, acknowledging that after such a miserable season, he could lose his job.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "National Party leader David Littleproud says Barnaby Joyce's decision to quit the party was \"disappointing\" and he had broken his contract with those who elected him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is disappointing for the people of New England and disappointing for the loyal National Party members who tirelessly volunteered over the past two decades to support his political ambitions,\" Littleproud said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud said the party had supported Joyce through \"tough times\" and his \"darkest moments\" and he had been encouraged to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Barnaby has chosen to walk away from The Nationals\u2019 team \u2014 a strong team that fights for regional Australia and delivers genuine solutions for regional Australians in Government,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Nationals will continue to fight for regional Australia and work as a team to get things done for local communities.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Barnaby Joyce reveals he spoke with Pauline Hanson amid National Party split plans\n\nEarlier, the former deputy prime minister used the final sitting day to deliver a brief speech to the chamber announcing his decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited differences with Littleproud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After 30 years with the National Party, I am resigning from the party. And that leaves me with a heavy heart,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I have to do, if I'm going to continue on that fight, is get myself into a better position than the ejection chair of the backbench of the Coalition in Opposition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyce said he was concerned about dealing with the cost of living crisis, regional communities and hospitals, as well as an ever more \"provocative\" Chinese government.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is unclear how he will continue to advocate for these issues as his political future remains uncertain.\n\n\n\nHe previously led the party on two occasions and announced earlier this year he would not recontest his seat in New England in 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat could leave the door open for him to pursue a seat in the Senate.\n\n\n\nTipped to join One Nation\n\nIn recent weeks, there had been speculation Joyce would resign and join One Nation, and he had been asked about his plans on several occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just don't want any circus. I'm trying to wait till the end of the sitting week,\" Joyce told 2GB radio on Monday when asked about his political future.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he later told reporters on Thursday he hadn't made up his mind on whether to join One Nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut former National Party colleague and current senator Bridget McKenzie told reporters earlier Joyce's reputation would be \"trashed\" if he ran with One Nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's actually done serious things, and his legacy is significant, but that will be trashed if he goes to One Nation, and I think that's the big difference, and that's the question he's going to have to ask himself.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe repeal, supported by the Minns government, the Liberals, the Greens and a number of independents, means that future decisions on feral horse management in Kosciuszko National Park can be made in the same way as other feral management decisions in other national parks.\n\nThe Kosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act 2018 was spearheaded by former NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro during the former Coalition government, and required the population of feral horses to be maintained at no less than 3000 in certain retention areas of the park. The rationale was that the presence of the horses, also called brumbies, in the Snowy Mountains landscape was considered part of Australia\u2019s colonial heritage.\n\nHowever, the feral horses also damaged the delicate Alpine ecosystems of the High Country on the NSW-Victorian border and put native species at threat.\n\nLoading\n\nThe population of 3000 wild horses will be maintained until mid-2027 when the current statutory management plan for the national park expires.\n\nNSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe said this was a landmark decision by a cross-party group to protect the state\u2019s only alpine national park.\n\n\u201cI have visited Kosciuszko National Park and clearly seen that control of wild horses is enabling the natural ecosystem to bounce back,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cThis bill will ensure that horses are treated the same way as other invasive species in NSW national parks.\u201d\n\nBe the first to know when major news happens.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Luke McQueen once sold out a theatre in Edinburgh by telling a big lie: he promoted the show as a gig by the hugely popular Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle. When McQueen, who bears no resemblance to Boyle, sidled onto the stage, he was met by stunned silence. \u201cEr, Frankie Boyle\u2019s not coming,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, Luke McQueen. Give me a cheer if you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d No one cheered. The only sound was the scraping of chairs as people stood up and headed for the exit. One enraged punter kicked McQueen\u2019s collection bucket across the stage on his way out. \u201cGuys, don\u2019t go. I\u2019m funny,\u201d pleaded the man on stage. Deliberately upsetting a crowd of Frankie Boyle fans would make most people nervous, but McQueen isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI thought the whole thing was so exciting,\u201d he says of the 2014 gig. \u201cThe thing I love more than anything is committing to an idea.\u201d The bogus Frankie Boyle show is typical of McQueen\u2019s highly conceptual approach to comedy. His work often starts with a palpable truth \u2013 in this case, the fact it\u2019s extremely hard to sell tickets to Edinburgh shows that don\u2019t feature big names \u2013 before spinning off into the realms of pure imagination. The McQueen who walked out on stage and told the audience they weren\u2019t going to see Frankie Boyle was a character; his attempt to turn confusion and disappointment into comedy was the performance. \u201cI was originally going to tell people they were going to see a gig by Ricky Gervais,\u201d admits McQueen when I meet him at a theatre in London\u2019s Soho. \u201cI emailed Ricky and said \u2018I\u2019ve had this idea \u2013 do you mind if I do it?\u2019 He replied that he thought it was really funny, but he couldn\u2019t say yes because he couldn\u2019t knowingly upset his fans. Which is totally fair. So, I used Frankie Boyle without asking.\u201d Another example of comedic identity theft from McQueen\u2019s oeuvre is a performance in which he claimed (entirely fictitiously) to be the former stage partner of the English comedian Jack Whitehall. McQueen professed to be so embittered at being usurped by Whitehall\u2019s dad, he\u2019d written an entire show about it. There is video footage of Whitehall walking on stage during a performance of the show in Edinburgh, an incident McQueen insists was not staged. McQueen says his comedy often plays with notions of likeability. Unlikeability might be a better description. There\u2019s a video of him shaving his head in the middle of a crowded ice rink, an act of atonement designed to win back an ex-girlfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe once poured a can of soup on his head in front of a Van Gogh at London\u2019s National Gallery in a parody of the Just Stop Oil protests and he\u2019s staged a fake reality show called The Luke of Love, offering a group of unsuspecting female contestants the chance to date him. The perplexed women were hooked up to a polygraph machine and asked questions such as: \u201cDo you know where my biological mother is?\u201d In every case, he insists he was firmly in character. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do this kind of thing as me,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIt would be obnoxious.\u201d He\u2019s very much in character \u2013 albeit a character who happens to be a comedian called Luke McQueen \u2013 in the show he\u2019s bringing to next year\u2019s Melbourne International Comedy Festival. It\u2019s called Luke McQueen: Comedian\u2019s Comedian, and it takes some explaining. Loading The title refers to a popular podcast hosted by an English comedian called Stuart Goldsmith. Since the first episode was recorded in 2012, hundreds of guests \u2013 a who\u2019s-who of hilarity ranging from Jimmy Carr and Tim Minchin to Stewart Lee and Katherine Ryan \u2013 have discussed the serious business of making people laugh. One person who has never been asked to appear is ... Luke McQueen. Furious at being ignored, McQueen phones Goldsmith and demands to know why he\u2019s been snubbed. A recording of their toe-curling conversation \u2013 which ends with Goldsmith hanging up the phone \u2013 is played at the start of the show. McQueen runs the recording through an AI voice generator and clones the podcast host\u2019s voice. Like a malignant ventriloquist, he has acquired the ability to put words in his nemesis\u2019s mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Goldsmith represented on stage by a shop mannequin topped with a disturbing homemade head, McQueen sets about staging his own edition of Comedian\u2019s Comedian. At first, things go to plan. McQueen, a preening figure in a brown suit, answers a series of fawning questions he\u2019s written himself. \u201cYou\u2019re largely regarded as one of the most innovative comedians in the world,\u201d says AI Goldsmith. \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d \u201cBored,\u201d sniffs McQueen, running a hand through his lustrous hair. Halfway through the show, things take a dark turn. The AI \u2013 which everyone knows can\u2019t be trusted \u2013 malfunctions. The questions go off script; they become hostile and deeply personal. What follows is an unhinged, brutally funny journey into the darkest corners of McQueen\u2019s psyche as he\u2019s eviscerated by his algorithmic interlocutor. As ever, it\u2019s hard to discern how much of the show is real. Was Goldsmith in on the joke all along? McQueen ponders the question, then replies, \u201cYou\u2019ll think this is a lie, but I swear it\u2019s the truth: I simply don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke McQueen outside the BBC in 2018, protesting against the airing of his show The Luke McQueen Pilots. Credit: PA Images via Getty Images He\u2019s just as evasive when I ask him what happened when Goldsmith attended a performance of the show in Edinburgh. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ruffle those feathers,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful.\u201d While McQueen is happy to discuss his comedy, he hands-down refuses to talk about himself. Requests for basic biographical details are met with silence. \u201cI expect I\u2019ll regret this interview because I don\u2019t like being myself in public,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cMy personal life is not anyone\u2019s business. The only thing you need to know about me is my work.\u201d He smiles apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be difficult. I don\u2019t mind if you know my age or where I was born. But I also think \u2019why do I have to tell you?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an age when relentless self-promotion is the norm for entertainers seeking to connect with their audience, this is an unusual stance, to say the least. But McQueen is something of a digital ghost. Wikipedia has yet to discover him, he ditched most of his social media accounts during the pandemic and there are no interviews in which he sheds light on anything relating to his personal life. Under pressure, he reveals that he studied performing arts at the University of Bedfordshire, where an inspirational tutor encouraged him to see comedy as a gateway to acting. \u201cWhen I started, I genuinely didn\u2019t know much about comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cRicky Gervais was probably the most alternative comedian I knew. Obviously, I\u2019m friends with a lot of comedians now and a lot of them are comedy nerds. They love it. But even now I\u2019m not a super fan.\u201d Luke McQueen says he\u2019s \u201cnot a super fan\u201d of comedy. At times, he admits, comedy has felt like a straitjacket. He\u2019d love to do more acting and directing, but it can be difficult breaking free of the festival circuit and the exhausting demands of writing and performing a new comedy show every couple of years. Producers and commissioners can have a blinkered view of performers and often want facsimiles of successful shows. \u201cI think repetition is the most disgusting thing in terms of creativity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that we need to find something that\u2019s like something that\u2019s come before is pathetic.\u201d His persona in Luke McQueen: Comedian\u2019s Comedian \u2013 a fragile, thin-skinned man who responds to rejection by turning his impotent rage on a podcast host \u2013 is not entirely fictitious. \u201cI play with the truth, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any truth in it,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the character\u2019s arrogance and bravado is like me screaming at the industry \u2018what is your problem?\u2019\u201d He is, by his own admission, still trying to make it. He\u2019s brimming with ideas for films, TV shows and stage productions, but acknowledges it\u2019s tough standing out from the crowd. \u201cThere\u2019s loads more that I want to do in this world, but I don\u2019t know if I ever will,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement",

What does that say about the future of spin bowling in Australia? And what does it say that Joe Root\u2019s part-time off-spin is all England think they need? Joe Root took 0-12 from one over in the first Test in Perth. Credit: Getty Images \u201cJoe Root as your national team spin bowler would make anyone who cares about cricket cry. It\u2019s so totally embarrassing,\u201d MacGill says. \u201cHow haven\u2019t they cultivated other spinners? \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a good enough job developing our own spin bowlers.\u201d\n\nShane Warne was spin bowling\u2019s most powerful advocate, always spruiking the value of having a slow bowler in an XI. His presence is missed by tweakers everywhere. \u201cShane Warne would be turning in his grave,\u201d says ex-Australian leg-spinner Kerry O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cHe\u2019d just be teeing off, wouldn\u2019t he? Former Australian cricketer Stuart MacGill. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWarnie contends \u2013 and it\u2019s fair \u2013 that if it seams, it spins. It sounds like a clich\u00e9, but when it seams, matches end early. \u201cIs it now just marking time on Australian pitches and waiting for the trips to the subcontinent? That can disillusion young spinners on the way up that they\u2019re only going to play in certain parts of the world.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Lyon bowled 122.4 overs \u2013 the fewest he has sent down in a home campaign in his career. There is every chance Lyon plays a pivotal role in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. But if Australia\u2019s greatest off-spinner isn\u2019t even guaranteed a game \u2013 or bowling fewer overs \u2013 what does that mean for a craft already under siege as Australian pitches offer more for the quicks? Lyon spoke about the issue in August. \u201cI know how important spin bowling is, but there is a degree of me that\u2019s concerned about spin bowling around the world, not just Australia, with the wickets we\u2019re playing on,\u201d Lyon said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at spin bowling and your younger spin bowlers around the country, they\u2019re not getting the overs or the opportunities to bowl on day-three, day-four wickets, or spinning wickets, or even green seamers because the fast bowlers are dominating.\u201d O\u2019Keeffe understands where Lyon is coming from. \u201cHe was such a big part of home campaigns and now every pitch they play on affords sideways movement for the quicker bowlers and it lasts most of the match,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe says. \u201cNine wickets for Lyon last summer in a winning series against India is bittersweet.\u201d Former Test spinner Stephen O\u2019Keefe, who took 301 first-class wickets at 24.66, remains bullish about Australia\u2019s depth but concedes Lyon\u2019s situation could disillusion some.\n\n\u201cDomestically, I think we\u2019re in the strongest position we\u2019ve been in a long time in terms of depth,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says. \u201cMitch Swepson, Tanveer Sangha, Corey Rocchiccioli, Todd Murphy, Ben Manenti and Matt Kuhnemann are there, and I think all of them have the potential to play for Australia. The hard part is when they look up and don\u2019t see a spinner playing. \u201cI\u2019m picking a spinner every day of the week, even in this pink ball game. Steve O\u2019Keefe celebrates one of his 12 wickets during the 2017 Test in Pune. Credit: AP \u201cIf Nathan doesn\u2019t play at the Gabba and bowls two overs in Perth, I think is really worrisome for domestic spinners. Five Tests, and you don\u2019t need a spinner for two? That would be so disappointing. \u201cMaybe do what Beau Webster did. Stop bowling offies and take up medium pace. That might be the shortest path into the Australian team because that seems more effective. In Australia, it is quite tough, so we need to judge our spinners a little differently.\u201d\n\nIt is expected England will only double down with the bat in Brisbane. Even at 2-0 down, Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum won\u2019t deviate from their aggressive method. Lyon loves bowling on day-five pitches, but unless Australia\u2019s batters pile on runs, that scenario may not materialise this series. \u201cI think Bazball, if anything, increase his chances of playing,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says. \u201cThey may go hard at him, but in Australia he\u2019s one of the hardest spinners to attack on bigger grounds. I\u2019m backing him as a weapon. He\u2019s just as effective to break a partnership or knock over one of their top order batters as much as Scotty Boland is.\u201d Both Kerry O\u2019Keeffe and MacGill have an eye on the future. They are excited by young Sydney leg-spinner Tom Brooks, who took 6-44 for NSW\u2019s second XI this week against Tasmania and bowls \u201cbig ripping leg breaks\u201d. But Lyon\u2019s predicament could have a ripple effect in the years to come.",

McKenna made the radical point that the thousands of fans who had travelled to Perth in hopes of seeing cricket might have deserved more respect. In 1970-71, a washed-out Melbourne Test was replaced by what turned out to be the first one-day international. Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith on the way to the course in January last year. Credit: Getty Images More than 46,000 spectators got to see some cricket, and in a speech at the end of the one-dayer Sir Donald Bradman said: \u201cYou have seen history made.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wrong. The lesser-known story was that England\u2019s captain Ray Illingworth was furious the match was scheduled without consultation and angry that a seventh Test was added to the series.\n\nHe was less furious when England, by winning that seventh game, recovered the Ashes in Australia for the first time since Bodyline. In December 1978, I was at a World Series Cricket day-night game in Sydney that was over before the dinner break. The West Indies were all out for 66 in 33.4 overs, and Australia knocked off the target in the 19th. Instead of going home without having seen the new SCG lights come on, we were treated to a second match. The teams came out in coloured uniforms for the first time: Australia in canary yellow, the West Indies in coral pink. Three weeks later, the coloured clothing was worn in a scheduled match. Nobody remembers the result of the extra game, but that wasn\u2019t the point. The Packer organisation put the fans first. And the players seemed happy enough to play more cricket.\n\nThe implausibility of this happening in Perth, or even being seriously considered, says a lot about today\u2019s approach to the game. Workloads, or their lack of, have to be micromanaged. Superb golf courses have to be played. Fans have to be ignored. There are probably contractual prohibitions on anything spontaneous taking place after the rigours of a Test lasting 141 overs \u2013 not two days, but a day and a half. I\u2019m reluctant to join the pile-on against England, who, until the last quarter in Perth, appeared likely to win. If they turn around and win in Brisbane, or win the Ashes, there will be enough egg on enough distinguished faces to go around. But it\u2019s hard to get around the absence of cricket in their preparation and what it says about how they view the game. They have scheduled extra net sessions in Brisbane, which is all very well if efficiency comes first: have a bowl, have a hit, get away for 18 holes.\n\nIt leaves out the rhythmic demands of playing actual games of actual cricket: the hours spent waiting to bat or ruing what you\u2019ve done to get out; the hours in the field; the hours of doing\n\nnothing. England \u2013 and Australia too \u2013 are preparing for a game that swings on sudden bursts of energy, wickets falling in clumps, one explosive innings, a match decided in a session or even a few overs. It\u2019s exciting to watch if you have a short attention span. It also looks like a self-fulfilling system of shortcuts. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised at the frankly atrocious standard of batting in Perth: it was what the teams practised for. And England practised much more intently for it than Australia did. So we go on to Brisbane, where fans will hope they aren\u2019t dudded like those in Perth. You really worry for those English tourists who have booked tickets for both.\n\nMuch focus has been placed, rightly, on England\u2019s batting, but presumably they will be able to catch lightning in a bottle at some point and pile up a match-winning total in quick time or, better still, no time. I thought their bowling should cause them real worry. Mark Wood, who had not played a game since February, was spent after eight overs in the first innings. Jofra Archer and the England attack fatigued quickly in Perth. Credit: Getty Images Jofra Archer was good for a Twenty20 spell with the new ball on the Friday, but that pretty much did it for him. The lack of endurance should come as no surprise when the preparation consists of eliminating endurance in favour of efficient little bursts.\n\nAfter the match, Wood considered driving from Perth to Brisbane until he found out that it might last five days. Loading If we get another abbreviated Test in Brisbane, whichever way it goes, the question must be asked more directly: do these players owe their fans more than lip service? Ought a limited-overs match be staged on the missing day three or four? Nervous players and management tend only to see potential downsides: injuries, giving away their secrets, more damned cricket. But as the 1971 and 1978 experiences showed, impromptu games delivered long-suffering spectators a measure of respect. A contract between players and fans existed.",
