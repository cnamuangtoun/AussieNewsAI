(ABC News: Dylan Anderson)\n\nIt would also establish and control new accountability and truth-telling bodies but would not have veto powers over government decision-making.\n\nThe treaty bill is still expected to pass with the support of Labor and the Greens.\n\nEarlier today, Premier Jacinta Allan attended a smoking ceremony on the steps of Parliament house ahead of the Treaty debate.\n\n\"We trust you to do the right thing for us, as we are Victorians too,\" Uncle Andrew Gardiner, Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung elder and representative on the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria, told the crowd.\n\nIn a statement, Victorian Greens leader Ellen Sandell said the Liberals' new position on repealing Treaty would not make a difference.\n\n\"It's deeply disrespectful that the Liberals have turned their backs on this history-making moment and on Aboriginal Victorians who have been working for years on Treaty,\" she said.\n\n\"To use this historic and proud moment to sow division is a new low, even for the Liberals. The Liberals have been a hopeless opposition, and the fact that their only plan for Victoria is to drag us backwards shows just how unfit for government they are.\"",

(Unsplash: Anastasiia Chepinska)\n\nBut she says it's up to each individual (or couple) to decide when the time is right for them to share the big news.\n\n\"I've never told [anyone] to not tell anyone. In fact, I would usually say to share it with a support person and some close family and friends, so that you do have some support,\" she says.\n\nWhen you need to tell your employer about your pregnancy\n\nLegally you need to provide a minimum of 10 weeks' notice before you intend to finish work.\n\nMelissa Innes says you need to give 10 weeks' notice in writing. (Supplied: Dr Melissa Innes)\n\nDr Melissa Innes, an associate lecturer in the School of Business at the University of the Sunshine Coast, on Kabi Kabi Country, says this is to ensure the employer has enough time to advertise and recruit a replacement.\n\n\"The idea is that that you try and give them as much notice as you can because that's a healthy working relationship.\n\n\" And yes, it does provide for them to find someone to help out while you're not there. \"\n\nShe says employers have legal obligations to provide parental leave under the Fair Work Act.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nWhat that looks like \"does depend on the nature of your workplace and the relationship that you have with them and how long you've been with your employer,\" says Dr Innes.\n\n\"If you're working for a great employer who is focused on their employer brand \u2026 then they may have some best-practice approaches to parental leave.\"\n\nThese can include financial support beyond government schemes, flexibility in leave and return to work, and superannuation contributions during leave.\n\nIf these are in place, Dr Innes says an employee might feel happy to let their employer know much earlier than 10 weeks that they intend on taking parental leave.\n\nHow to have the conversation about a pregnancy\n\nDr Innes says an employee needs to provide the \"10 weeks' notice in writing\".\n\n\"I personally would prefer initially a face-to-face discussion about something as personal as this that's going to affect your life in a big way,\" she says.\n\nI'm glad I took paternity leave My son now looks at me the same way he looks at Mum \u2014 and I wouldn't change that for anything.\n\n\" But legally you do actually need to provide that written notice. \"\n\nShe says you also need to clarify how much time you're intending to take and whether you're taking continuous unpaid leave, as per the Fair Work Act.\n\nShe also recommends investigating whether your workplace has other options in place and how much you would like to use those, for example flexible parental leave and working from home.\n\nThe same applies to partners when they want to take parental leave.\n\nSunshine Coast-based business author and psychosocial safety specialist Brenda Jamnik says people may find themselves needing to have conversations with employers sooner than they'd hoped due to complicating factors.\n\n\"Some women will have a different performance level,\" she says.\n\n\"For example \u2026 [with] constant morning sickness, sometimes they just can't drag themselves out of bed.\n\nBrenda Jamnik says people may find themselves needing to have conversations with employers sooner than they had hoped. (Supplied: Dr Brenda Jamnik)\n\n\" If you've got a really good workplace, they will understand that [you] may need to access leave. \"\n\nDr Jamnik says parental leave typically begins six weeks before the expected due date, or earlier if the employer agrees.\n\nIf someone wants to work beyond that, the workplace can ask for a medical certificate from the employee stating whether they are fit to work and if their position is safe for them to work in during this period.\n\n\"Some people get upset about this,\" says Dr Jamnik, \"but really it is about the mum's fitness for work because the employer has a duty of care.\"\n\nEmployers need to support pregnant staff\n\nDr Jamnik says employers need to make suitable workplace adjustments for a pregnant employee to ensure they can work safely.\n\n\"The employer has an obligation to make what's called reasonable adjustments to ensure not only that they provide modified work hours [if needed] but also that they might adjust the workplace to make it safe,\" she says.\n\nParents receiving government paid parental leave to get super Parents accessing the government-funded paid parental leave will receive an additional 12 per cent of their payments in super from July next year, after the federal government's legislation passed parliament.\n\n\"If [the employee is] in a retail sector, they might ask if they can have a chair.\n\n\"They can ask for ergonomic stations, changes to their start and finish times, those sorts of things.\"\n\n\"If the employer says, 'look, we've got no safe job', they're entitled to unpaid parental leave or they're entitled to leave.\"\n\nShe warns that businesses cannot discriminate against any employees because of their pregnancy.\n\nThis article contains general information only.

        "text": "Tension with the prime minister is written into the treasurer's job description.\n\nEconomic reforms can shape how history remembers a government, but they rarely seem like political winners from the outset. It is a treasurer's job to push the unpopular and the prime minister's job to push back on the unsellable.\n\nJim Chalmers has embraced this role, unafraid to show his ambition for tax reform and venture beyond the more cautious Anthony Albanese. Though he has more often than not been pulled back into line, he has also had the occasional victory.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of those victories soured into a defeat. With the boss on leave, Chalmers was sent out to mangle his own super earnings tax, an idea he championed back in 2023, and which seemed closer than ever to passing with Greens support.\n\nThe treasurer insisted it was his own idea to unwind every single contentious element of his plan to double the earnings tax on super balances above $3 million, replaced with a new plan to raise less money from fewer people.\n\nBut the prime minister's fingerprints were all over the backflip. First, the tax vanished from the legislative agenda. Second, a trickle of media reports suggested he was having doubts. Third, Treasury confirmed it had met with his office to discuss criticisms of the policy.\n\nAxe (contentious elements of) the tax\n\nWithin a day of that revelation, cabinet's expenditure review committee met to axe the parts of the tax that had caused trouble from the beginning, with the changes finalised by cabinet on Monday.\n\nThe $3 million threshold would be indexed, sparing more taxpayers from the tax in the future but slashing the amount of revenue the new tax would raise. And the tax would no longer apply to \"unrealised\" earnings, such as a higher valuation on a home or farm.\n\n\"We have found another way to deliver on the same objectives,\" Chalmers ventured.\n\nRelationships between prime ministers and treasurers have inevitable tensions. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nThere was a consolation prize of an even higher tax on earnings above $10 million, and a substantial super boost for low earners, which could net some people an extra $15,000 in retirement, and which was welcomed by welfare advocates.\n\nBut there are no two ways about it: the new plan does not do as much as the old plan to rein in tax concessions for super, which politicians of all stripes have long admitted flow disproportionately to the wealthy, but which have been stubbornly hard to dislodge.\n\nReform finds no backers\n\nFrom the outset, the changes were difficult to explain. The rationale for taxing unrealised gains was fuzzy at best \u2014 the government said it was the only way large super funds could administer the tax.\n\nThere was some substance to that point. Super funds treat their members' money as one big pool, and can't easily distinguish which members \"realise\" any particular gain.\n\nHow Labor's super tax proposal is changing Every prominent criticism of the tax has been addressed, with the result that it will apply to fewer people and raise less money.\n\nBut explaining why it was fair to tax people on earnings they couldn't actually access because they were tied up in assets that were not liquid was difficult, even if the affected people were likely wealthy enough to manage.\n\nAnd it was tough to justify the decision not to index the threshold, except on the grounds that it would raise more money.\n\nTrue, critics exaggerated how significant this would have been. Even in 15 years' time, the tax would still only have covered about one in 20 super funds.\n\nAnd crucially, those people would still be getting a tax concession \u2014 just a smaller one. They would pay 30 per cent instead of 15 per cent, only for the portion of their earnings which fell above the $3 million line \u2014 still lower than the top income tax rate of 45 per cent most would otherwise pay.\n\nBut it's not hard to see how that argument could lose people, and it seems, at least, to have lost the prime minister.\n\nTreasurer's unrealised ambitions\n\nIn the end, all this ado might amount to nothing much. In 2028-29, the new version of the tax would raise $2 billion, whereas the old one would raise $2.5 billion. A lot of kerfuffle for half a billion, even if the gap would have grown over time with indexation.\n\nFew would go so far as to say that the super tax changes \u2014 in either their past or present form \u2014 constitute the sort of legacy-defining tax reform that economists covet. They are the sort of thing vaunted economist Ken Henry likes to call \"tinkering\".\n\nBut the ill portents for a treasurer who has said he wants to \"grasp the nettle\" and take on bigger-picture reforms to the tax system, but who has been up against a wary prime minister from the start, are hard to ignore.\n\nDespite its colossal election victory, Albanese's government continues to err on the side of caution.",

(ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nUniversity deputy head of education Patrick Hampton said from next year, aspiring teachers would be able to live and work locally while earning their Bachelor of Primary Education.\n\n\"It's a revelation for students at the schools here in Broome that they can actually study teaching whilst living in Broome,\" he said.\n\n\"It's new, it's unique \u2026 through the Reach Higher program, students don't have to come from Broome to Perth, and they'll be studying the same program we offer in Sydney and Fremantle.\"\n\nLearning closer to home\n\nThere are also 56 Regional University Study Hubs (RUSH) dotted across the country.\n\nThe government initiative, launched in 2018, was designed to expand access to tertiary education for regional and remote students.\n\nPilbara Kimberley University Centres chief executive Susan Grylls said she helped students with everything from enrolment and educational counselling to getting doctor's certifications.\n\nSusan Grylls says the community's interest in the centres has been incredible. (ABC Pilbara: Kelsey Reid)\n\n\"You can't do what you can't see,\" she said.\n\n\"There are aspiration challenges of young people \u2026 because they have a perception you must be a certain individual from a certain background to pursue certain pathways.\"\n\nMs Grylls said workforce shortages and challenges in the state's far north had been \"a crisis that had been going on for many years\".\n\n\"Our focus is very much on providing those people who know they love living in the remote Kimberley \u2026 with the opportunities to pursue higher education to take up those workplace roles we desperately need.\"\n\nMs Grylls, who oversees five university hubs across WA's north, is optimistic a sixth centre in Kununurra would get off the ground by the start of next year.\n\nThe Kununurra University Hub was announced in February 2025 as part of a federal plan to create 10 new Regional University Study Hubs, following recommendations from the Universities Accord Review.\n\nShe said the centres had a real impact and their popularity had been steadily increasing in areas with \"historically low\" tertiary education uptake.\n\n\"We're still a new idea, a new concept and we don't get the same funding as other, more established models,\" Ms Grylls said.\n\nNational targets\n\nA Department of Education spokesperson said the RUSH program had been \"successful in improving tertiary education participation\".\n\n\"As of the latest data collection, 5,270 students were being supported by a RUSH,\" they said.\n\n\"Of these, 12 per cent identified as First Nations and 44 per cent identified as [the] first in [the] family.\"",

On the upside, global trade had remained at a high level, in part reflecting significant shifts in global trade patterns in response to the higher tariffs. GDP growth in Australia\u2019s trading partners had also remained resilient and stronger than expected in the June quarter. Economic activity in the United States had been surprisingly robust, though employment growth had slowed over preceding months and GDP growth was expected to slow as well. Members noted that the slowing in US employment growth could, at least in part, reflect changes in US immigration policy and measures to reduce the number of federal government employees. Higher tariffs were also contributing a little to US inflation.\n\nOn China, the board members noted that domestic demand had slowed by more than expected in July and August, but any material slowing in activity in China would probably prompt incremental fiscal stimulus from the authorities to support growth.",

        "text": "If you have budding musicians in your life, you know that preparing for exams or competitions can be stressful for the whole family.\n\nExams and competitions provide snapshots of how well musicians cope under pressure.\n\nBut more often than not, the process is riddled with expectations to do well, and a sense that this is a 'make-or-break' moment.\n\nGetting your kids to practise their musical instrument might be easier than you think Musicians share why kids need to practise, how to get them motivated and how to incorporate it into your family\u2019s daily routine.\n\nThis added pressure might also lead some musicians to experience performance anxiety which can include emotional and physical symptoms like nervousness or dread, shaking, sweating, racing heart and feeling nauseous.\n\nSo, why do we put young musicians through exams and competitions in the first place?\n\n\"Exams are very useful to motivate kids to practise, and it puts some structure around their learning by giving them a goal to work towards,\" says Genevieve Lang, co-host of ABC Classic's Music Class and a professional harpist.\n\nThese are also great transferable life skills.\n\nBut is there a way to reduce the stress?\n\nWe ask a few experts to share practical tips for making these high-pressure situations as stress-free as possible.\n\nWhat do you get out of doing exams and competitions?\n\nPerformance exams might not be for everyone.\n\nLang says the people who most benefit from exams and competitions are those who are really motivated by results.\n\n\"They might be encouraged to continue to stretch themselves if they [do well],\" she says.\n\nMost people studying music will have to do an exam at some point in their journey. (Pixabay)\n\nAlthough competitions can be optional, most people studying music will encounter exams at some stage, either at school or university.\n\nMusicians can also choose to do graded exams from institutions outside of school. Some of the most common in Australia are the Australian Music Examination Board (AMEB), the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) and the Suzuki method.\n\nThese grades range from beginner to advanced levels and provide qualifications that are well-regarded in the music community.\n\nDoing exams can also help broaden your repertoire through fulfilling the requirements of the exam syllabuses, Lang explains.\n\nWhat do examiners and judges want?\n\nIt's easy to assume that you need to be note-perfect to succeed in performance exams. But while there is a baseline expectation of technical proficiency, it isn't the sole focus.\n\nYour music questions answered Music Class is a weekly deep dive with Ed Le Brocq and Genevieve Lang into all things music, including musical terms, notation, theory and much more.\n\n\"Judges and examiners are looking for communication over perfection,\" says Tim Li, a Brisbane-based teacher and chamber music ensemble coach.\n\nAs a pianist, Li has played with many students during their music examinations.\n\nHe recently coached the IncrediBows string quartet, an ensemble which just won Musica Viva's national youth chamber music competition, Strike A Chord.\n\n\" It's very important to establish the right mentality, which is to make music. \"\n\nLi points out that sometimes, the harshest critic you face is yourself.\n\n\"When you communicate the ideas and the feelings with the music, it's very easy for the adjudicator to look past technical imperfections.\"\n\nIf you're a parent or caregiver, you can help young musicians by framing the performance as a positive experience at home and in the lead up to the big moment.\n\n\"Rather than saying, 'have you practised enough?' or 'don't make mistakes', you can say 'I love hearing you play' or 'I can see how hard you're working'.\"\n\nCreating doubts about whether you've practised enough, or focusing on not making mistakes, can backfire, according to Li.\n\n\" The more you focus on not making mistakes, you tend to start to make more mistakes. \"\n\nHow do you manage performance anxiety?\n\nPerformance anxiety can significantly impact someone's ability to play.\n\nKnowing how to manage it can be beneficial for musicians so they can achieve the best outcome.\n\n\"Anxiety is about focusing on what might go wrong in the future based on what has gone wrong in the past,\" says string musician and psychologist Anthea Cottee.\n\nPerformance anxiety can stop some people from enjoying playing the music when it matters. (Unsplash: Siniz Kim)\n\nWhen we get anxious, our body releases neurotransmitter hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol which can increase our heart rate as well as sweating and shaking. Not to mention the feeling of dread and fear of failure.\n\nThis, in turn, makes us less able to concentrate on the task at hand, namely performing to the audience, which includes judges or examiners.\n\nLi says sometimes it's useful to think about these high-pressure situations in terms of potentials and distractions.\n\n\"Your end result is your potential minus the distractions,\" he says.\n\nBut that's easier said than done for most people.\n\nThe main findings of the research of music performance anxiety centres around our perception of how acceptable we are to other people, according to Cottee.\n\nOne way to influence how our bodies cope with these high-pressure situations is by thinking about the situation like a challenge rather than a threat.\n\n\"It's really about being able to bring all your talent and resources as effectively to the moment when you need them,\" Cottee says.\n\n\" Use that fuel [of adrenalin and cortisol] to enhance your focus for your performance. \"\n\nThis is where preparing and practising, including having some psychological preparations, can really set you up for success.\n\nHow do you prepare to get the best outcome?\n\nLang says performing for an audience such as family and friends, or filming yourself and uploading the recording online can help to simulate high-stakes moments before the big day.\n\nShe regularly practises performing during the lead up to important concerts.\n\n\"If something goes wrong at any point in the performance, a memory slip or a finger slip, I have had a chance to practise in the moment with all the fight and flight response going on,\" Lang says.\n\nEven very young children can practise this skill by performing to soft toys, Li suggests.\n\nIn performance, you have to keep going even if you play some wrong notes. (Adobe Stock: Chalabala)\n\nIn performance, as opposed to regular practice, you need to keep going even if you play some wrong notes or make other errors.\n\nSo how do you move on when you can't stop to fix your mistakes?\n\nRather than blaming yourself or your kids, Cottee says we can practise to be kind and compassionate.\n\nIf you're criticising yourself, \"Ask if that's something you would say to a friend,\" says Cottee.\n\nThere's no way around the fact that you are being judged when doing exams or competitions. But shifting the focus to what you love about music could be more helpful than worrying about what the other person thinks.\n\n\" Think about how beautiful this piece of music is, how much you enjoy the feeling of playing, or how good it makes you feel. \"\n\nWhat happens if you actually fail?\n\nAlthough exams or competitions can feel like the most important performance of your life, according to all the experts we spoke with, it's not as career-defining as you might fear.\n\nEven if you or your kids fail the exam or don't win the competition, \"you probably learn a lot from the experience,\" Cottee says.\n\nLearning from failure can be a foundation for resilience, Cottee explains.\n\n\"We develop resilience through difficulty. There's actually no other way around it,\" Cottee says.\n\nBut as a parent, she acknowledges how difficult it is to let kids learn from hard experiences.\n\n\"Just getting up [on stage] and performing is a great experience to have,\" Li says, even if you don't get any prize.\n\n\" Learn from the process and you'll know how to do better next time. \"\n\nAlthough exams and competitions might help in building a music career, they're not the only path to success.\n\n\"A lot of countries don't have exam systems, and they produce very high-level musicians,\" Li says, but adds that you need to work with the system that's available.\n\n\"I didn't do exams on my harp, and the harp is my career,\" Lang says.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

        "text": "A decision not to prosecute a Beetaloo Basin oil and gas company for an alleged breach of environmental laws sets a low standard for the Northern Territory's environmental protections, according to a legal expert in the field.\n\nImperial Oil and Gas was found to have breached its Environment Management Plan (EMP) by drilling in the Beetaloo Basin in 2022, according to a report approved by the Department of Lands, Planning and Environment (DLPE) in April this year.\n\nThe DLPE found the company drilled the fracking well \u2014 dubbed Carpentaria-3H \u2014 without constructing an underground barrier between two major aquifers below, as required by its EMP.\n\nImperial is a subsidiary of Empire Energy, which changed its name to Beetaloo Energy this year.\n\nThe Beetaloo Basin has attracted a number of companies looking to mine natural gas in the NT. (ABC News: Jane Bardon)\n\nThe ABC has seen documents released to anti-fracking group Lock the Gate, under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, which state the DLPE elected not to prosecute the company \u2014 instead, the government department sent a letter \"intended [to] encourage behaviour change\".\n\nThat was despite the DLPE report claiming Imperial had a \"history of non-compliance\", \"uncertain\" risk of aquifer interaction, and an acknowledgement Empire may have benefited from the non-compliance.\n\nThe department said it asked Imperial to alter its EMP in 2021, to reflect the detection of an aquifer \u2014 called Anthony Lagoon \u2014 near another aquifer, called Gum Ridge, below the well site.\n\nBut Imperial declined the alter the plan, and told the department \"the aquifers will be isolated as already required by the EMP\".\n\nThe ABC has seen documents released to anti-fracking group Lock the Gate. (ABC News: Michael Donnelly)\n\nIn late 2022, after drilling at Carpentaria-3H had begun, the DLPE said it discovered \"Imperial had not isolated the Anthony Lagoon and Gum Ridge aquifers from each other\".\n\nThe DLPE said the Department of Mining and Energy (DME) \"took action to ensure it does not happen again\" and \"prosecution was considered disproportionate\" to the alleged offending.\n\n\"Prosecution was considered disproportionate to the actions taken by [the Department of Mining and Energy],\" the DLPE said in its report.\n\n\"The cost of remedial actions to comply with DME requirements is considered a sufficient deterrent.\"\n\nHowever, the environment department's report also noted \"any remedial actions could compromise\" the integrity of fracking wells in the NT.\n\nCompany denies wrongdoing\n\nIn a statement responding to the DLPE findings, Beetaloo Energy chief executive Alex Underwood said \"there was no incident\".\n\nHe said the report \"was not previously seen by the company\" and alleged it \"contains numerous inaccurate and misleading statements\".\n\nNT Mining and Energy Minister Gerard Maley agreed with the company's view.\n\nGerard Maley says Imperial did not breach the law. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\n\"There was no incident or non-compliance at the Carpentaria-3H well, under the regulatory responsibilities administered by the DME,\" he said.\n\nImperial only needed to separate the aquifers if they were not already connected, according to the minister.\n\n\"Imperial had its own scientific evidence that indicated the Anthony Lagoon and Gum Ridge aquifers were in communication, plus publicly available scientific evidence from CSIRO publications on the area,\" Mr Maley said.\n\nHowever, a 2021 report from the DLPE's Water Resources Division said \"the evidence to date on the degree of connectivity between the two aquifers is inconclusive\".\n\nWhat happens if aquifers connect?\n\nA study looking to determine connectivity between aquifers in the eastern Beetaloo Sub-Basin \u2014 including Anthony Lagoon and Gum Ridge \u2014 is underway, with the CSIRO due to deliver its findings next year.\n\nPete Callender from Lock the Gate said it was incredibly important for any aquifers to remain separate if they were not already connected.\n\nPete Callender says Lock the Gate is worried about the potential for groundwater wells to be linked due to fracking activity. (Supplied: Frack Free NT)\n\n\"Some of our aquifers are for example hypersaline, some contain heavy metals, toxins,\" he said.\n\n\" If they were to be connected to a freshwater aquifer, then that material could get in. \"\n\nIn its report earlier this year, the DLPE said \"consequences from aquifer connectivity and interaction are uncertain\".\n\nElaine Johnson, director of environmental law firm Johnson Legal, said if the DLPE was correct in its finding that Imperial breached its EMP, the company had broken the law.\n\n\"It's a legal requirement to comply with the terms of the Environment Management Plan,\" she said.\n\nClaims company let 'off the hook'\n\nNT Lands, Planning and Environment Minister Josh Burgoyne said the allegations raised in his department's report had been \"dealt with\" by the previous Labor government, before the Country Liberal Party was elected late last year.\n\nJosh Burgoyne says Imperial was dealt with by the DME. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\n\"Our department is now working to ensure that anything that happens now, and into the future, is obviously dealt with and all the processes are followed,\" he said.\n\nBut Ms Johnson said the NT's environmental laws were weakened by successive governments choosing not to enforce them.\n\n\"It's essentially letting the company off the hook, so that when it goes to apply for a new licence or approval, its past non-compliance behaviour is not taken into account,\" she said.\n\n\"What that means is we set up an expectation with industry, that the requirements and rules to ensure environmental protections are not really going to be enforced \u2014 and in fact, we'll turn a blind eye when you come back to us for a new approval.\"\n\nElaine Johnson says without proper enforcement, NT environmental protections could be weakened. (Supplied: Johnson Legal)\n\nIn January, Beetaloo Energy disclosed a spill of contaminated water at its Carpentaria-1 well, and last year it was investigated by the federal government for alleged misuse of a research grant.\n\nBut regarding the allegations concerning aquifer separation below Carpentaria-3H, the company's chief executive maintained drilling at the site had caused \"no environmental harm or impact\".\n\n\"Beetaloo Energy has demonstrated our commitment to sustainable operations, transparency and accountability in the 12 years we have been active in the Beetaloo Basin,\" Mr Underwood said.",

        "text": "The September data showed that even as exports to the US slumped, those to the European Union rose 14.2 per cent. Exports to South-East Asian economies were up 15.6 per cent, while to Latin America they climbed 15.2 per cent and to Africa (off a modest base) they surged 56 per cent. China\u2019s exports have been re-routed, demonstrating that Trump\u2019s thesis that China\u2019s export-oriented economy made it over-dependent on the US market was flawed. In 2018, when the first of Trump\u2019s tariffs on China were imposed, exports to the US accounted for about 3.5 per cent of China\u2019s GDP. Last year, that percentage was 2.8 per cent. It will be significantly lower this year. Trump\u2019s tariffs can damage, and are damaging, China\u2019s economy, but the country\u2019s exposure and vulnerability to them is reducing rapidly. Now, America - while still an important destination for Chinese goods - is part of a far more diversified global market for Chinese companies, one fortified by massive investments by China in economies other than the US that are also gradually shifting their geopolitical relationships away from America. Trump\u2019s tariffs on everyone are aiding that process.\n\nWhile there are some signs of pushback against the flood of cheap exports from China in Europe, Latin America and even Africa, there\u2019s nothing occurring of the scale and breadth of the US tariff regime to stem them. Very few of those economies dealing with the Trump tariffs would want to open a new front by initiating a trade war with China. Loading What Trump may have underestimated was the rest of the world\u2019s \u2013 and America\u2019s \u2013 reliance on China\u2019s cheap goods and China\u2019s dominance of key industrial technologies and their supply chains. There are no instantly available and competitively priced substitutes for many of its key exports. There\u2019s also no market for some of America\u2019s agricultural products bigger than China. It was notable that China\u2019s imports of soybeans in September were up 4.8 per cent to 12.9 million tonnes. American farmers are now harvesting a near-record crop, none of which has been pre-purchased by China, which now sources most of its soybeans from South America.\n\nLast week\u2019s significant tightening of export restrictions on rare earths, magnets and batteries, which caused Trump to threaten China with a 100 percentage point hike in the tariff rate, also highlighted China\u2019s own leverage in the trade stoush, and how it is amplified by US financial markets, which went into a meltdown on Friday and would\u2019ve played a role in Trump\u2019s backing away from his initial aggressive response. Trump used to boast that trade wars were good and easy to win. Experience of the Trump tariffs says that they aren\u2019t good for anyone, and no one wins. The September trade data showed that China\u2019s exports of rare earths were down 31 per cent from August and were about half the volumes China was exporting mid-year. It would appear that China had started squeezing the market for rare earths, a market it absolutely dominates, even before the announcement of the new export restrictions. Wall Street recovered some of their losses on Monday after Trump adopted a far more conciliatory tone. The growth in China\u2019s exports shows how dynamic its companies are.\n\nSome of that growth will reflect an arbitraging of tariff rates, with goods being trans-shipped to their eventual destination, America, but there\u2019s also an organic appetite for cheap Chinese goods in the developing economies that China has been building relationships with for years through its Belt and Road initiative. The growth is coming at a cost, with export volumes significantly higher than their value. China\u2019s companies are operating in sectors with substantial excess capacity and fighting torrid price wars in their domestic markets. They have slashed export prices to absorb that excess capacity, which has caused increased tension with China\u2019s non-US trade partners even as their profits have kept falling. It\u2019s also led to deflation and weaker growth in an economy that has never fully recovered from a downturn in its property market that is now in its fifth year, although a 7.4 per cent rise in China\u2019s imports in September, to $US238.1 billion, could suggest the domestic economy is faring a little better than most forecasters have predicted. Beijing has responded with a campaign against what it calls \u201cinvolution,\u201d or excess capacity and continuing cycles of price competition, which should see some consolidation of industries and some companies exiting markets.\n\nChina\u2019s broader economic data for September is due to be released next week, which will provide a better insight into the toll the trade war and China\u2019s domestic settings are taking on an economy which is over-exposed to trade. Loading Also next week, the most important meeting of China\u2019s leaders for the year \u2013 the \u201cFourth Plenum\u201d \u2013 will start, with hundreds of the country\u2019s senior officials reviewing the government\u2019s next five-year plan for the economy and society. To date, Beijing has resisted any large-scale effort to stimulate the domestic economy to dilute its reliance on exports - but there will be significant interest from external observers in whether there are plans to boost consumption over the remainder of this decade, and whether there will be more done to address the structural imbalances and the degree of unproductive capital within the economy. Trump used to boast that trade wars were good and easy to win. Experience of the Trump tariffs says that they aren\u2019t good for anyone, and no one wins.",

Thank you!\u201d replies Sam Pang. It\u2019s a Friday lunchtime and the 51-year-old comedian and TV host is sitting in the back dining area of the old-school corner pub in Melbourne\u2019s inner-city suburb of Fitzroy. He is just days away from launching season two of his chat show Sam Pang Tonight and is still a bit twitchy after a few days of heavy press. He has a reputation for not liking interviews, something, he says, was purely a product of him always playing second or third fiddle on panel shows. With Sam Pang Tonight, however, and his Logie hosting duties, he has been prised into the open. Still, the interview comes with a caveat \u2013 no personal questions \u2013 but he will happily talk about his work. He is great company \u2013 charming, personable and generously laughing at my terrible jokes \u2013 but sees no point in talking about himself. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about myself,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people, by the way, love talking about themselves. You know, they love it. But this show, it seems when your name\u2019s in the title \u2013 and I\u2019m so grateful, and I\u2019m proud to be able to have my own show \u2013 I\u2019m happy to try to do some publicity, or get the word out there.\u201d He winces when I mention I spotted him that day on the cover of TV Week (headline: \u201cI\u2019m very grateful\u201d) and admits that, yes, he gets recognised regularly. Is he a celebrity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with being a comedian. I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d So there\u2019s no tell-all book coming, the usual celebrity memoir caper? \u201cThat sounds like too much work.\u201d His good friend Kitty Flanagan has written a book \u2026 \u201cBut she\u2019s a supremely talented woman who can do anything, and I\u2019m concentrating so hard on doing just one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cShe can do that because she\u2019s already a triple threat. I\u2019m not that.\u201d Sam Pang\u2019s order: salt and pepper squid with togarashi mayo, bean sprout, spring onion salad and burnt lime. Pang chose the Napier because \u201cbecause pub meals are a bit hit and miss \u2013 I don\u2019t usually go for the food \u2013 but this is good, I can back this menu in.\u201d He adds a side of chips to his plate of salt and pepper squid with togarashi mayo, spring onion salad and burnt lime, while I go for the enormous crispy fish burger with salad and fries (it\u2019s delicious, but it\u2019s also the most awkward food you can eat while interviewing someone). For drinks, it\u2019s a large soda water with lime for both of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe won\u2019t say if the pub, which featured in the ABC TV series Jack Irish, is his local \u2013 although staff member farewells him by name when we leave \u2013 but he did attend primary school nearby, in Clifton Hill. He won\u2019t give away much about his family: I try to sidle in by talking about my young daughter, knowing he also has a daughter, and for a moment, it looks like he\u2019s going to say something before he decides not to. Same story when I ask about his parents. Do they watch his show, are they proud? \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, so you know\u2026,\u201d he jokes. What he does confirm, however, is that he is related to Lorrae Desmond, aka Shirley from A Country Practice aka Australian TV royalty. When I read that, I honestly thought it was made up. She is his mum\u2019s cousin \u2013 although his mum had never met her \u2013 and Pang arranged to present with Desmond at the Logies in 2017. The enormous crispy fish burger with salad and chips. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui \u201cWe grew up hearing about this mythical figure,\u201d says Pang. \u201cShe was on A Country Practice, and she won a Gold Logie and had her own show \u2026 the Logies asked if I wanted to present with Ed or Tom [his Have You Been Paying Attention co-stars] but I said I\u2019ll present at the Logies if I can do it with Lorrae Desmond, which was an odd request. \u201cAnd they found her. She was living in Bowral [she died in 2021]. She hadn\u2019t been on telly for ages. And it was a special moment. There\u2019s a lot of love in the room for it. And I remember \u2013 it\u2019s the only time I met [Mushroom Records boss] Michael Gudinski \u2013 he came up and said, \u2018Well done. Well done on celebrating and getting her here tonight, so that people can pay tribute to her.\u2019 It was like, you know, I can do nice things \u2026 I think I made mum proud.\u201d Lorrae Desmond as Shirley in A Country Practice. While Pang may see no point in talking about himself, he is one of our most in-demand small-screen personalities, who manages to work simultaneously across two commercial networks (on Have You Been Paying Attention and Sam Tonight on Ten and the Logies and The Front Bar on Seven). He has also logged several stints at SBS, co-hosting Eurovision for eight years with Julia Zemiro, as well as two seasons of the FIFA World Cup show Santo, Sam and Ed\u2019s Cup Fever! and one year of the short-lived quiz show ADbc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of TV. This year alone, he\u2019ll have been on our screens for, say, about 40 out of the 52 weeks in a year. \u201cThis will be as \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 combative as I get,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you add up the hours, what is it, about 90 [hours across the year]. So if you, say, hosted a nightly news program or a breakfast television show, they\u2019re on five days a week, for three and a half hours a day. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m on that much \u2026 but for the next eight weeks, you\u2019ve got me for eight hours, OK? My work ethic is ridiculously overblown. There\u2019s the illusion of busyness.\u201d Sam Pang is one of the rare small-screen personalities who is working across multiple networks. Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Sam Pang in epsiode one of season two of Sam Pang Tonight. And yes, they got a new chair for the guests. His chat show returned for its second season on Monday night this week. The first season, which debuted in March for an eight-week run, was the first time Pang had gone solo since ADbc in 2009. It was a rough ride, with ratings diving after the first episode premiered to mixed reviews, while viewers had opinions on everything from the choice of guests to the cheap-looking set (in particular, he desperately needed a new guest chair). Pang, however, says he was not bothered by the feedback. Or the ratings, which started at about 799,000 (for comparison, on that same night, Married At First Sight on Nine held 2.43 million viewers captive), but then dropped away before a small recovery at the end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the trend of the viewers had kept on going \u2013 I think someone described it as a J curve or something like that \u2013 I didn\u2019t look at the ratings, but there\u2019s other people that do. I just feel like there\u2019s nothing that I can control less. On Monday night, we\u2019ll do the show and, hopefully, enough people watch that the network says you\u2019re on again next week. That\u2019s all. Loading \u201cI was on Have You Been Paying Attention and The Front Bar when no one watched them. And I thought, when I did them at the time, that we had a good time shooting them and then the idea that [the ratings the] next day would affect the enjoyment or satisfaction [I had] of the night before, you know, that\u2019s not a good model. But there\u2019s commercial realities, and if it just started off at this number and it went down, I understand you don\u2019t survive.\u201d The thing is, Pang is a survivor. His rise from working in a bottle shop in his 20s, after several false starts at university, to manning the phones for Melbourne community radio station 3CR and then a spot on Triple R\u2019s breakfast show to, eventually, TV and commercial radio is well known. It\u2019s a rare path to tread, especially when you don\u2019t have connections, apart from a neighbour who was a Triple J producer who suggested community radio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t paid, I was a volunteer,\u201d he says of his start on 3CR. \u201cIt was like I was in a radio station. That\u2019s cool.\u201d He first words on air, as a fill-in host for the Marngrook Footy Show, were \u201cHello, welcome to the Marngrook Footy Show, I\u2019m Sam Pang, and I\u2019m not Indigenous.\u201d The bill After that, it was just one step after another, no great light bulb moment, no great magical career plan. He won\u2019t say if he\u2019s signed on for the Logies again next year \u2013 although it\u2019s hard to imagine Seven won\u2019t have him back, as this year\u2019s broadcast was its highest rating since 2012, with an average national audience of 1.43 million.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nStuart Applebee has been growing potatoes in north-west Tasmania for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotato mop top virus isn't the first disease he's dealt with.\n\n\n\n\n\nHearing it has made its way into his state was a blow, but he's hopeful it can be managed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like any new virus, it's quite concerning when you know you're probably the first state to be detected in the country with it. Once we found out a little bit more out of New Zealand and a couple of other countries that are dealing with it, that probably relaxed my own thoughts a little bit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPotato mop top virus isn't a threat to human health, but it can affect the skin and flesh of potatoes and impact crop yields.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was first detected on a farm in north-west Tasmania in July, also marking the first time it's been found in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting in Tasmania ahead of planting saw 1,700 tonnes of infected seed potatoes destroyed, with calls for a federal assistance package for affected farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasFarmers CEO Nathan Calman says concerns also remain about how it got here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most concerning thing about the mop top incursion into Tasmania is that this isn't just the first time the virus has been detected in Tasmania, but it's also the first time that it's been detected within Australia. So its presence here represents a failure of our national biosecurity protocols, but also our state biosecurity protocols.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStuart Applebee says steps need to be taken to avoid a repeat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have these rules and regulations in place, and somehow things are coming in. We're not that far away from having a major outbreak of something here, if this is going to be a common practice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry told SBS the current government has committed an extra $2 billion to resourcing the country's biosecurity system since it came to power and that the system is \u201cworld-leading.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBiosecurity Tasmania says it has not yet been able to confirm \u2013 and is unlikely to be able to confirm \u2013 when or how potato mop top virus arrived in Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a spokesperson said efforts so far to trace the source indicate it could have been present in Tasmania for at least two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's chief plant protection officer, Dr Gabrielle Vivian-Smith, was questioned about the incursion by Tasmanian senator Richard Colebeck in Estimates last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Potato mop top virus is believed to have been in the country for at least two years based on what we know in terms of tracing at this point. But it's not known exactly how it arrived in Australia, it potentially could have come in on a number of different pathways.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiosecurity Tasmania said the virus has been detected across multiple sites - including growing sites, a research site and storage facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only detection on the mainland to date is in seed potatoes in cold storage in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat state, as well as New South Wales and South Australia, has placed restrictions on the movement of unprocessed potatoes and production equipment from the Apple Isle.\n\n\n\n\n\nA national committee last month decided the virus was not eradicable in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nZarmeen Hassan is the biosecurity manager for the peak representative body for the potato industry, AUSVEG.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says if it's been in Tasmania for two years, there is a concern it's already spread to the mainland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So far we know that it's only in Tasmania, right? We don't actually know whether it has spread to the mainland. If it has not spread to the mainland, then obviously the industry and government want to work towards containing it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the Tasman, New Zealand has been dealing with mop top for seven years, after it was found at a processing plant on the South Island in September 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand also determined it could not be eradicated, but Potatoes New Zealand CEO Kate Trufitt said management is going well \u2014 so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re not seeing any impact. Our processes monitor it and report back if we see any (effects). So we're not really seeing that impact at all. We're not seeing lost yields, we're not seeing anything. But they do call it the sleeping disease, so something for us to be aware of is that something could happen in the future. So we do need to be looking to the future and whether we do more surveys. We look to resistant varieties. And we do get advice from international players because it is worldwide.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said washing down of machinery when moving between farms, crop rotation and improving soil health were crucial in preventing the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother disease found in potatoes \u2013 powdery scab \u2013 is a known vector of potato mop top virus, helping it to spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tasmanian government is investing $200,000 into a research program looking into powdery scab and mop top.\n\n\n\n\n\nZarmeen Hassan said powdery scab is found across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Powdery scab is prevalent in the country across all the growing, majority of the growing regions. And if that's the case, then it may be further than Tasmania. We don't know that, it's a bit of an unknown right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMop top and powdery scab can both remain dormant in soil for years, even without a potato crop.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s currently no soil test to detect powdery scab or mop top but work is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At this point, there isn't a soil testing protocol and methodology in place in Australia. It is being worked on but planting season is starting now, so it won't be available for this planting season; it will be available for the next season.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanting the next crop of potatoes is getting underway in Tasmania, but ongoing rain means for some, including Stuart Applebee, the ground is still too wet.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this and other challenges, he can't imagine doing anything different.\n\n\n\n",

Before the increase, Mike and his family of four had been eating a lot of \"brown food\", he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was cheaper to buy packaged chips than potatoes, so we'd buy the packets,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But suddenly it was COVID and the payments went up and we could afford the potatoes, afford fresh produce.\"\n\n\n\nFor Australians like Mike, the end of the Coronavirus Supplement in 2021 and the return to \"regular\" social support payments like JobSeeker, Austudy and Youth Allowance after lockdown meant a return to poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates are calling for government service payments to be brought back up to COVID-levels, to address the millions of Australian students, jobseekers and single parents who are forced to live below the income poverty line as rents steadily increase nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spite of small increases to social support payments since the pandemic, including a $12.50 per fortnight increase to JobSeeker in September this year, Australia's social service payments are \"woefully\" below the poverty line, the head of a leading anti-poverty advocacy group says.\n\n\n\nOne in seven Australians living below the poverty line\n\nA new report from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the national advocacy group for poverty, disadvantage and inequality, the Australian Council of Social Security (ACOSS), found more than 3 million Australians were living below the poverty line in 2022-23.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative poverty line is defined as 50 per cent of the median household after-tax income, with those below it considered to be experiencing poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the latest figures from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, researchers found the number of people living in poverty in Australia has increased to one in seven, up from one in eight in 2020-21.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Canberra, ACOSS CEO Cassandra Goldie said an increasing number of Australians were faced with the choice between putting food on the table and experiencing homelessness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality is that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, poverty is on the rise. Housing costs are affecting many people, but if you're on a low fixed income, JobSeeker is just $401 a week,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nYuvisthi Naidoo, a senior research fellow at UNSW\u2019s Social Policy Research Centre who was the lead researcher on the study, said the JobSeeker payment was just 42 per cent of the national minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our report, we show how far the income support payments are below the poverty line,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Currently, for example, somebody who is relying on the JobSeeker payment is $205 per week below the income poverty line. A sole parent with two children who is on a family payment is $163 below the poverty line. And a young person on Youth Allowance is $279 under the poverty line.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The report found the poverty line for a single adult is $584 per week, minus housing costs. JobSeeker is now $793.60 per fortnight for a single with no dependants, while a single person with one or more children receives a maximum of $849.90.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures reveal a poverty gap of nearly $380 per fortnight, or $190 per week, for a single with no dependants. For families with children, the poverty line was $1,226, meaning incomes on that weekly payment were $464 below the poverty line.\n\n\n\n\n\nNaidoo said income support payments were currently so low that the government would need to increase them \"significantly\" to meet the poverty line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they're going to make a $56 a week increase, it's not going to be much. There needs to be a substantive increase in the working-age income support payments,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we talk about what the poverty line is, we remember the national minimum wage is a figure that's higher than the poverty line. The JobSeeker payments are so far below the line and level of destitution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNaidoo said it was \"not possible to live on income support payments\", even if a recipient also receives rent assistance.\n\n\n\nFamilies with children\n\nMike and his wife Liz moved to Wagga Wagga from Sydney with their two young children after finding themselves out of work and unable to afford rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair decided to study and become primary school teachers \u2014 something they thought would be an \"absolute job-guarantee way of retraining\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But you've basically got to live on Austudy, in poverty for four or five years, and then you're going to have debt at the end of it,\" Mike said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a matter of searching for food almost to see what you could afford to put on the table before the money ran out each fortnight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nACOSS' report stresses that one in six children is living below the poverty line \u2014 more than 750,000 Australian kids. Goldie said it was \"disturbing\" for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's disturbing for all of us is that we are seeing an increase in poverty on our watch,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's very true that in a very wealthy country, for many people, [living in poverty] is a devastating experience that leads to a great sense of 'I'm not as worthy as other people' and a great desire to hide the experience, as you look around and see other people who have a lot of money, and a lot of people who are doing extremely well.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News She said for children in particular it was a \"terrible signal\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for parents, Goldie said poverty had \"devastating effects\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Both in the immediate term in terms of chronic anxiety and distress \u2014 you're constantly figuring 'What can I afford today, what can I go without, do I keep paying the rent and keep the roof over my head whilst I can only afford to feed myself once a day?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said experiencing poverty had significant impacts on people's mental health, and would leave acute anxiety, something Mike says he is all too familiar with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It'd often come down to the last five dollars, for Liz and I to not eat, to feed the kids,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a juggling act of the highest order, trying to juggle all this stuff and at the end you still fail, right? It just depends how well you do it, and you kick yourself when you fail, but it's how well you can juggle all of this stuff.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMike said the worst part of poverty was the social isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you're living on Centrelink income support, the kids and yourself are basically prevented from going anywhere,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got no money to put petrol in the car, so you don't go visiting, you can't meet friends at the pub for a pizza, right? It's just not something you can do at all.\"\n\n\n\nCost of living pressures, housing stress key drivers of poverty\n\nThe report highlights increasing rents as a key driver of rising poverty. Housing affordability advocates agree.\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Colvin, a spokesperson for Everybody's Home, a national advocacy coalition targeting Australia's housing crisis, said the poverty report \"demonstrates that runaway rents are pushing more Australians than ever into rental stress and homelessness, leaving many struggling to cover basic living costs\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one should have to choose between paying rent and buying food, medicine and other essentials, but sadly this is becoming more common,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report notes that the lowest-paid people were experiencing rental stress \u2014 when more than 30 per cent of one's pay is spent on rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2022-2023 period, the proportion of renters in the lowest 20 per cent of earners experiencing rental stress increased to 57 per cent, up from 52 per cent in 2020\u201321.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News \"Access to a safe, decent, and affordable home is the foundation to building a stable, secure life,\" Colvin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Right now, Australia has a social housing shortfall of 640,000 homes and demand is rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To turn the tide on rising poverty we need the federal government to urgently deliver a major boost to public and community housing so people being squeezed out of the rental market can find a decent, affordable home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNaidoo said rent assistance wasn't helping low-income earners.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said from 2021 to 2023, median advertised rents for units went up 30 to 40 per cent in all major cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government increased rent assistance by 10 per cent in September 2024, but Naidoo said it needs to be \"significantly higher\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The important thing to remember is that only around a quarter of all people on income support payments actually receive Commonwealth rent assistance,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMike said he believes that everyone just wants to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a social thing. It's an empowering thing. It gives you some satisfaction,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't think people really understood the \"social exclusion that comes with having no money\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You just cannot participate in society, and when that happens, communities break down,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But please, people shouldn't be treating those who don't have those resources like pariahs. All us humans need this. It's part of who we are, and to have it excluded as a kind of punishment defies logic to me.\"\n\n\n\n",

Where are we going to meet? What are we going to say once it happens? And also preparing the girls. They have two daughters, Roni and Alma, four years old and two years old. We had to try and frame it in a way that they understand that their daddy might be returning home soon.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the West Bank, Yousef Shamasneh says he is waiting for the release of his sons, Abdel Jawad and Mohammad Shamasneh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I swear to God, the 34 years have been extremely difficult \u2014 very, very hard. Even though many prisoner exchange deals were made over the years, they were always excluded. But thanks to God, today, He has willed their release, and we are truly happy and grateful for that.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Treasurer says changes to superannuation policy aims to make the system better and fairer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low-income superannuation tax offset will be raised from $500 to $810.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eligibility threshold will be lifted from $37,000 to $47,000 effective from July 1 in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 3.1 million Australians eligible for the offset, the change is projected to add around $15,000 to the superannuation balance by retirement age.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers also announced changes to tax concessions for Australians with higher super balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For earnings on super balances between 3 and 10 million dollars, the rate remains 30 per cent. The rate for over 10 million dollars becomes 40 per cent. So, this is still a concessional tax arrangement, but it is better targeted. It will still only impact only half a per cent of Australians.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government's controversial decision to approve an extension to a gas plant in Western Australia is being challenged in the Federal Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation has launched the legal challenge, arguing the minister left critical details out of his decision on Woodside's North West Shelf extension, one of the world's biggest liquified natural gas projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extension to 2070 has prompted backlash from conservation groups, and First Nations communities concerned about impacts on ancient rock art.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam Beeson is the general counsel at the Australian Conservation Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Australian Conservation Foundation is challenging the lawfulness of the minister's decision. The minister decided that the climate change impacts of this project were not relevant to his decision to approve this project. We think that was wrong, and if successful, this case could reshape the way that climate impacts are assessed in Australia. We also think the minister made legal mistakes when he waved through this project because he didn't understand with any precision what gas will actually be processed at this facility.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in six Australian children are living in poverty - defined as households earning half the median Australian household after-tax income - $584 a week for a single adult and $1226 a week for a couple with two children.\n\n\n\nThat's the finding of a new report* by the Australian Council of Social Services and the University of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report shows poverty has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also found 3.7 million people, or 14.2 per cent of the population, were living in poverty in the years 2022-23, equating to one in seven Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat includes 757,000 children.\n\n\n\n\n\nACOSS CEO, Dr Cassandra Goldie, says the federal government needs to take urgent action to address inequity and the impacts felt by the poorest Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Costs are affecting many people but if you're on a low fixed income, JobSeeker for example is just $401 per week. If you're trying to get private rental out in the market, you simply cannot afford to pay. We could immediately lift the adequacy of social security payments, and dramatically decrease the rate of poverty in this very wealthy country. We could make sure that we're regulating the increase in rents. And growing the supply of low-income housing.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport - Australia has recorded the highest run chase in women's O-D-I history against India, at the Women's Cricket World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nChasing down India\u2019s mammoth 330, skipper Alyssa Healy made 142 from 107 deliveries. It is the sixth ODI century of her career.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat set the team up to claim the win.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealy says it feels great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have been watching me in the nets, it has been a frustrating experience because I feel like I have had no rhythm whatsoever. I have been struggling to find it and I didn't really know where it went before I came into the World Cup. But I think once you step out in the field, your competitive instincts kick in - and you kind of lock into getting into the contest. And that was a really enjoyable experience. And like I said, it was my day today.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The government has retreated on changes to unrealised capital gains and adjusted tax concessions for larger superannuation balances following ongoing concerns from businesses and economists.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a surprise press conference on Monday, Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced six superannuation changes signed off by cabinet hours earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a review, the government is proposing a second tier of super concessions, with a 40 per cent tax rate applying for balances over $10 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis change comes in lieu of a super cap and will operate alongside the original 30 per cent on balances above $3 million as proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth balances will be indexed, addressing concerns the thresholds may capture more Australians over time due to bracket creep.\n\n\n\nThe changes include the removal of tax on unrealised capital gains, which Chalmers said \"was a genuine sticking point\" for critics, hoping its removal will mean \"no excuses but to support\" the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians on lower incomes will also see a change to their super tax offset, which will increase from $500 to $810 as the government expands the eligibility criteria from a $37,000 cut-off to $45,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers said the government had taken into consideration a series of feedback from industry experts, including during the economic roundtable in August .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our objective, which will be satisfied with these changes, is a fair tax system from top to bottom,\" he told reporters in Canberra on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It means better outcomes for people on the lowest incomes and better targeted concessions for people with the biggest balances. And that's a good outcome from our point of view.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers highlighted \"14 times more people will benefit from the lower income super changes than will be impacted by the better targeted concessions\".\n\n\n\nWhat are the six superannuation changes?\n\nFrom 1 July 2027, Australians earning between $28,000 and $45,000 will receive a $810 offset at tax time.\n\nSuperannuation balances over $10 million will be taxed at a 40 per cent concessional rate, alongside the existing proposal to tax balances over $3 million at 30 per cent.\n\nBoth the $3 million and $10 million thresholds will be indexed over time to address bracket creep.\n\nThe new changes will not apply to unrealised gains.\n\nThe changes will be delayed by a year, until July 2026, to allow for consultation, except for the lower income tax offset.\n\nExtend existing constitutional tax exemptions for federal and state judges.\n\nGreens accuse Labor of succumbing to 'pressure'\n\nChalmers said he'd had an initial conversation with Greens leader Larissa Waters about the changes following the cabinet meeting and hopes to \"engage constructively\" with the party.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said Chalmers had been forced to \"weaken\" his tax reform due to \"pressure\" from big businesses and the wealthiest, as the party welcomed tax relief for lower-income earners.\n\n\n\nGreens senator Nick McKim said the government lacks the courage to tax the wealthy. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas However, ahead of reviewing the full legislation, Greens economic justice spokesperson Nick McKim said on Monday afternoon the changes demonstrated the Albanese government \"doesn't have the guts to tax big corporations and billionaires fairly\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Labor has stripped out the tax on unrealised gains and indexed the $3 million threshold, a gift to the super-rich that will cost the budget billions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a capitulation to the wealthiest people in the country, and a slap in the face to everyone else who pays their tax straight out of their pay packet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Opposition's Treasury spokesperson Ted O'Brien said Labor's back-down was a \"win for everyday Australians\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Coalition will read the details before coming to any conclusion, which is the usual process, of course,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe opposed it every step of the way. And I want to say that today really is a victory for the coalition of common sense over a very tax hungry Labor government.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The September data showed that even as exports to the US slumped, those to the European Union rose 14.2 per cent. Exports to South-East Asian economies were up 15.6 per cent, while to Latin America they climbed 15.2 per cent and to Africa (off a modest base) they surged 56 per cent. China\u2019s exports have been re-routed, demonstrating that Trump\u2019s thesis that China\u2019s export-oriented economy made it over-dependent on the US market was flawed. In 2018, when the first of Trump\u2019s tariffs on China were imposed, exports to the US accounted for about 3.5 per cent of China\u2019s GDP. Last year, that percentage was 2.8 per cent. It will be significantly lower this year. Trump\u2019s tariffs can damage, and are damaging, China\u2019s economy, but the country\u2019s exposure and vulnerability to them is reducing rapidly. Now, America - while still an important destination for Chinese goods - is part of a far more diversified global market for Chinese companies, one fortified by massive investments by China in economies other than the US that are also gradually shifting their geopolitical relationships away from America. Trump\u2019s tariffs on everyone are aiding that process.\n\nWhile there are some signs of pushback against the flood of cheap exports from China in Europe, Latin America and even Africa, there\u2019s nothing occurring of the scale and breadth of the US tariff regime to stem them. Very few of those economies dealing with the Trump tariffs would want to open a new front by initiating a trade war with China. Loading What Trump may have underestimated was the rest of the world\u2019s \u2013 and America\u2019s \u2013 reliance on China\u2019s cheap goods and China\u2019s dominance of key industrial technologies and their supply chains. There are no instantly available and competitively priced substitutes for many of its key exports. There\u2019s also no market for some of America\u2019s agricultural products bigger than China. It was notable that China\u2019s imports of soybeans in September were up 4.8 per cent to 12.9 million tonnes. American farmers are now harvesting a near-record crop, none of which has been pre-purchased by China, which now sources most of its soybeans from South America.\n\nLast week\u2019s significant tightening of export restrictions on rare earths, magnets and batteries, which caused Trump to threaten China with a 100 percentage point hike in the tariff rate, also highlighted China\u2019s own leverage in the trade stoush, and how it is amplified by US financial markets, which went into a meltdown on Friday and would\u2019ve played a role in Trump\u2019s backing away from his initial aggressive response. Trump used to boast that trade wars were good and easy to win. Experience of the Trump tariffs says that they aren\u2019t good for anyone, and no one wins. The September trade data showed that China\u2019s exports of rare earths were down 31 per cent from August and were about half the volumes China was exporting mid-year. It would appear that China had started squeezing the market for rare earths, a market it absolutely dominates, even before the announcement of the new export restrictions. Wall Street recovered some of their losses on Monday after Trump adopted a far more conciliatory tone. The growth in China\u2019s exports shows how dynamic its companies are.\n\nSome of that growth will reflect an arbitraging of tariff rates, with goods being trans-shipped to their eventual destination, America, but there\u2019s also an organic appetite for cheap Chinese goods in the developing economies that China has been building relationships with for years through its Belt and Road initiative. The growth is coming at a cost, with export volumes significantly higher than their value. China\u2019s companies are operating in sectors with substantial excess capacity and fighting torrid price wars in their domestic markets. They have slashed export prices to absorb that excess capacity, which has caused increased tension with China\u2019s non-US trade partners even as their profits have kept falling. It\u2019s also led to deflation and weaker growth in an economy that has never fully recovered from a downturn in its property market that is now in its fifth year, although a 7.4 per cent rise in China\u2019s imports in September, to $US238.1 billion, could suggest the domestic economy is faring a little better than most forecasters have predicted. Beijing has responded with a campaign against what it calls \u201cinvolution,\u201d or excess capacity and continuing cycles of price competition, which should see some consolidation of industries and some companies exiting markets.\n\nChina\u2019s broader economic data for September is due to be released next week, which will provide a better insight into the toll the trade war and China\u2019s domestic settings are taking on an economy which is over-exposed to trade. Loading Also next week, the most important meeting of China\u2019s leaders for the year \u2013 the \u201cFourth Plenum\u201d \u2013 will start, with hundreds of the country\u2019s senior officials reviewing the government\u2019s next five-year plan for the economy and society. To date, Beijing has resisted any large-scale effort to stimulate the domestic economy to dilute its reliance on exports - but there will be significant interest from external observers in whether there are plans to boost consumption over the remainder of this decade, and whether there will be more done to address the structural imbalances and the degree of unproductive capital within the economy. Trump used to boast that trade wars were good and easy to win. Experience of the Trump tariffs says that they aren\u2019t good for anyone, and no one wins.",

Thank you!\u201d replies Sam Pang. It\u2019s a Friday lunchtime and the 51-year-old comedian and TV host is sitting in the back dining area of the old-school corner pub in Melbourne\u2019s inner-city suburb of Fitzroy. He is just days away from launching season two of his chat show Sam Pang Tonight and is still a bit twitchy after a few days of heavy press. He has a reputation for not liking interviews, something, he says, was purely a product of him always playing second or third fiddle on panel shows. With Sam Pang Tonight, however, and his Logie hosting duties, he has been prised into the open. Still, the interview comes with a caveat \u2013 no personal questions \u2013 but he will happily talk about his work. He is great company \u2013 charming, personable and generously laughing at my terrible jokes \u2013 but sees no point in talking about himself. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about myself,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people, by the way, love talking about themselves. You know, they love it. But this show, it seems when your name\u2019s in the title \u2013 and I\u2019m so grateful, and I\u2019m proud to be able to have my own show \u2013 I\u2019m happy to try to do some publicity, or get the word out there.\u201d He winces when I mention I spotted him that day on the cover of TV Week (headline: \u201cI\u2019m very grateful\u201d) and admits that, yes, he gets recognised regularly. Is he a celebrity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with being a comedian. I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d So there\u2019s no tell-all book coming, the usual celebrity memoir caper? \u201cThat sounds like too much work.\u201d His good friend Kitty Flanagan has written a book \u2026 \u201cBut she\u2019s a supremely talented woman who can do anything, and I\u2019m concentrating so hard on doing just one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cShe can do that because she\u2019s already a triple threat. I\u2019m not that.\u201d Sam Pang\u2019s order: salt and pepper squid with togarashi mayo, bean sprout, spring onion salad and burnt lime. Pang chose the Napier because \u201cbecause pub meals are a bit hit and miss \u2013 I don\u2019t usually go for the food \u2013 but this is good, I can back this menu in.\u201d He adds a side of chips to his plate of salt and pepper squid with togarashi mayo, spring onion salad and burnt lime, while I go for the enormous crispy fish burger with salad and fries (it\u2019s delicious, but it\u2019s also the most awkward food you can eat while interviewing someone). For drinks, it\u2019s a large soda water with lime for both of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe won\u2019t say if the pub, which featured in the ABC TV series Jack Irish, is his local \u2013 although staff member farewells him by name when we leave \u2013 but he did attend primary school nearby, in Clifton Hill. He won\u2019t give away much about his family: I try to sidle in by talking about my young daughter, knowing he also has a daughter, and for a moment, it looks like he\u2019s going to say something before he decides not to. Same story when I ask about his parents. Do they watch his show, are they proud? \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, so you know\u2026,\u201d he jokes. What he does confirm, however, is that he is related to Lorrae Desmond, aka Shirley from A Country Practice aka Australian TV royalty. When I read that, I honestly thought it was made up. She is his mum\u2019s cousin \u2013 although his mum had never met her \u2013 and Pang arranged to present with Desmond at the Logies in 2017. The enormous crispy fish burger with salad and chips. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui \u201cWe grew up hearing about this mythical figure,\u201d says Pang. \u201cShe was on A Country Practice, and she won a Gold Logie and had her own show \u2026 the Logies asked if I wanted to present with Ed or Tom [his Have You Been Paying Attention co-stars] but I said I\u2019ll present at the Logies if I can do it with Lorrae Desmond, which was an odd request. \u201cAnd they found her. She was living in Bowral [she died in 2021]. She hadn\u2019t been on telly for ages. And it was a special moment. There\u2019s a lot of love in the room for it. And I remember \u2013 it\u2019s the only time I met [Mushroom Records boss] Michael Gudinski \u2013 he came up and said, \u2018Well done. Well done on celebrating and getting her here tonight, so that people can pay tribute to her.\u2019 It was like, you know, I can do nice things \u2026 I think I made mum proud.\u201d Lorrae Desmond as Shirley in A Country Practice. While Pang may see no point in talking about himself, he is one of our most in-demand small-screen personalities, who manages to work simultaneously across two commercial networks (on Have You Been Paying Attention and Sam Tonight on Ten and the Logies and The Front Bar on Seven). He has also logged several stints at SBS, co-hosting Eurovision for eight years with Julia Zemiro, as well as two seasons of the FIFA World Cup show Santo, Sam and Ed\u2019s Cup Fever! and one year of the short-lived quiz show ADbc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of TV. This year alone, he\u2019ll have been on our screens for, say, about 40 out of the 52 weeks in a year. \u201cThis will be as \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 combative as I get,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you add up the hours, what is it, about 90 [hours across the year]. So if you, say, hosted a nightly news program or a breakfast television show, they\u2019re on five days a week, for three and a half hours a day. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m on that much \u2026 but for the next eight weeks, you\u2019ve got me for eight hours, OK? My work ethic is ridiculously overblown. There\u2019s the illusion of busyness.\u201d Sam Pang is one of the rare small-screen personalities who is working across multiple networks. Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Sam Pang in epsiode one of season two of Sam Pang Tonight. And yes, they got a new chair for the guests. His chat show returned for its second season on Monday night this week. The first season, which debuted in March for an eight-week run, was the first time Pang had gone solo since ADbc in 2009. It was a rough ride, with ratings diving after the first episode premiered to mixed reviews, while viewers had opinions on everything from the choice of guests to the cheap-looking set (in particular, he desperately needed a new guest chair). Pang, however, says he was not bothered by the feedback. Or the ratings, which started at about 799,000 (for comparison, on that same night, Married At First Sight on Nine held 2.43 million viewers captive), but then dropped away before a small recovery at the end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the trend of the viewers had kept on going \u2013 I think someone described it as a J curve or something like that \u2013 I didn\u2019t look at the ratings, but there\u2019s other people that do. I just feel like there\u2019s nothing that I can control less. On Monday night, we\u2019ll do the show and, hopefully, enough people watch that the network says you\u2019re on again next week. That\u2019s all. Loading \u201cI was on Have You Been Paying Attention and The Front Bar when no one watched them. And I thought, when I did them at the time, that we had a good time shooting them and then the idea that [the ratings the] next day would affect the enjoyment or satisfaction [I had] of the night before, you know, that\u2019s not a good model. But there\u2019s commercial realities, and if it just started off at this number and it went down, I understand you don\u2019t survive.\u201d The thing is, Pang is a survivor. His rise from working in a bottle shop in his 20s, after several false starts at university, to manning the phones for Melbourne community radio station 3CR and then a spot on Triple R\u2019s breakfast show to, eventually, TV and commercial radio is well known. It\u2019s a rare path to tread, especially when you don\u2019t have connections, apart from a neighbour who was a Triple J producer who suggested community radio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t paid, I was a volunteer,\u201d he says of his start on 3CR. \u201cIt was like I was in a radio station. That\u2019s cool.\u201d He first words on air, as a fill-in host for the Marngrook Footy Show, were \u201cHello, welcome to the Marngrook Footy Show, I\u2019m Sam Pang, and I\u2019m not Indigenous.\u201d The bill After that, it was just one step after another, no great light bulb moment, no great magical career plan. He won\u2019t say if he\u2019s signed on for the Logies again next year \u2013 although it\u2019s hard to imagine Seven won\u2019t have him back, as this year\u2019s broadcast was its highest rating since 2012, with an average national audience of 1.43 million.\n\nAdvertisement",

It fell back to eighth place in the market in the all-important breakfast slot. The set survey timeslots do not always completely line up with the run time of different shows.\n\nDespite the recent gains, The Kyle and Jackie O Show finds itself largely with the same audience size compared to the same survey one year ago, with 427,000 Melbourne listeners across the survey period, which spanned July 20 to September 27. In the corresponding survey in 2024, there were 420,000 cumulative listeners.",

        "text": "Australians are once again being warned to tighten their online security and be extra alert to scammers, after up to 5.7 million Qantas customers\u2019 personal details \u2013 including phone numbers and birthdays \u2013 were leaked to the dark web on Sunday.\n\nCyber crime supergroup Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters accessed the data back in June by convincing a Manila-based call centre operator to give the hackers access to their Salesforce system.\n\nOn Monday, federal Cyber Security Minister Tony Burke said: \u201cYou can\u2019t simply outsource to other companies and think suddenly you\u2019ve got no obligations on cyber security\u2026 There are very serious penalties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut what are those potential penalties for Qantas? And why is a corporate watchdog warning about even more serious data theft risks when Australian finance companies outsource their work overseas?\n\nWhat penalties could Qantas face?\n\nLaw firm Maurice Blackburn has lodged a complaint over the Qantas data breach with Australia\u2019s independent privacy regulator \u2013 the Office of the Information Commissioner \u2013 alleging the airline breached privacy laws by failing to adequately protect customer information.\n\nWhen asked by the ABC, the commissioner\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t comment on whether Qantas would be fined over this latest breach.\n\nSo how much is the maximum fine for breaches like this?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUnder the Privacy Act, serious or repeated privacy breaches can now incur fines of up to A$50 million or 30% of a company\u2019s adjusted turnover during the period of the breach \u2013 whichever is greater.\n\nThis Qantas data breach is less serious than those that hit Optus and Medibank in 2022. For instance, hackers shared Medibank customers\u2019 highly sensitive medical history data, and stole valuable identity document data, including credit card, passport and driver\u2019s licence details. That matter is still before the courts.\n\nWhile the Qantas data was still sensitive \u2013 including customers\u2019 dates of birth, phone numbers, addresses, emails and frequent flyer numbers \u2013 it presents less of a risk for individual customers.\n\nBesides penalties under the Privacy Act, Qantas also faces a potential class action, which affected Qantas customers can join.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother potential outcome for Qantas could be a court-ordered payment scheme, in which individuals affected by the breach may be eventually entitled to compensation from Qantas.\n\nWe saw a similar arrangement for Facebook users affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach a decade ago.\n\nWhat are the rules for companies sharing your data overseas?\n\nThe Australian Privacy Act has specific provisions covering how companies handle your data when they send it overseas.\n\nImportantly, when an Australian company gives your data to an offshore entity, the Australian company remains accountable for ensuring your data is kept safe.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important for Australian companies to consider carefully the potential risks of sending Australians\u2019 data overseas.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThese risks should be front of mind for Qantas, which in 2024 suffered a much smaller data breach due to alleged misbehaviour of overseas contractors.\n\nHowever, these risks extend well beyond flagship companies such as Qantas.\n\nWarnings over even more sensitive data\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulates Australian markets and financial services companies. Only days ago, it warned of \u201cgovernance gaps\u201d when financial services companies outsource work overseas \u2013 and potentially put Australians\u2019 sensitive data at risk.\n\nThis year, ASIC has taken separate court action against Fortnum Private Wealth and FIIG Securities, alleging they failed to manage cybersecurity risks affecting thousands of customers.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn FIIG\u2019s case, ASIC alleges a hacker was able to steal sensitive data including passport, bank account and tax file numbers. Those court cases are yet to be heard.\n\nThe finance sector \u2013 including banks, financial advisors and superannuation funds \u2013 consistently reports the third highest number of data breaches, after the health sector and government.\n\nWhat we all need to do next\n\nAs individuals, we have relatively little control over how Australian companies handle our data, let alone the overseas companies they work with. But we can all do more to make ourselves more secure.\n\nBe on scam watch: given how many Australians were exposed in the Qantas breach, be on the lookout now for scammers.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHistory suggests scammers target data breach victims, or people who think they may have been impacted by a data breach. If you receive a message you suspect is a scam, don\u2019t respond \u2013 report it to Scamwatch.\n\nPractise good \u201ccyber hygiene\u201d: avoid using the same password on multiple websites. Instead, use a password manager that saves your passwords across your computer and mobile phone.\n\nThat way, if your data is breached at Company A, it has less chance of impacting your security with Company B.\n\nCompanies need to step up too: Australian company executives would do well to ensure their governance, risk and compliance practices are up to scratch, especially on how they manage third-party risks.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs consumers, we entrust our cyber security to all of the companies with whom we interact. Those companies, in turn, owe it to us to ensure the drive to maximise profits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of leaving customers worse off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
