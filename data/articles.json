        "text": "Many Australians now have access to cheaper visits to the doctor , after a $7.9 billion overhaul of the bulk billing system came into effect.\n\nBut not everyone gets to benefit from right away, with the government projecting it will take years for most GP practices to sign on to the scheme.\n\nSo what's actually changed, and what does it mean for you? This is what you need to know.\n\nMedicare is getting a $7.9 billion overhaul. (Justin McManus/The Age)\n\nWhat has changed for bulk billing incentives?\n\nUnder the previous system, the federal government incentivised doctors to provide bulk-billed consultations to children under 16 or patients who have a Commonwealth concession card.\n\nHowever, from Saturday, November 1, the scheme has been expanded so the incentive now covers anyone with a Medicare card.\n\nThe government has also introduced the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program (BBPIP) \u2013 an extra 12.5 per cent incentive payment to be split between doctors and practices that sign up for the program.\n\nThe changes aim to increase the proportion of GP appointments that are bulk billed. (Wolter Peeters/SMH)\n\nWhy have these changes been made?\n\nThe changes were announced in the lead-up to this year's federal election campaign .\n\nWhile it was partly a political move from the Labor government aimed at exploiting a perceived weakness of then-opposition leader Peter Dutton due to his stint as health minister, it's also aimed at addressing the declining bulk billing rate.\n\nIn 2020, the figure was sitting at a record high of 89 per cent. In 2024, it had fallen to 78 per cent (admittedly up fractionally from 77 per cent the year before).\n\nThe government says the overhaul will drive the bulk billing rate up to 90 per cent by 2030.\n\nThe policy was announced in the lead-up to this year's federal election. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nSo does this mean free GP visits for (almost) everyone?\n\nThat's the idea \u2013 the government wants as many Australians as possible to access free doctor appointments.\n\nIn practice, it's going to take a while for GPs across the country to sign on to the new scheme , although the government insists it's happy with the uptake so far.\n\nA few days out from its introduction, more than 1000 practices had indicated they would move to full bulk billing from November 1.\n\nTo hit its 90 per cent bulk billing rate target, the government in February said it needs 4800 practices on board (although about 1600 were already fully bulk billing before the changes came into effect).\n\nThat leaves a shortfall of about 2200 to close over the next few years.\ufeff\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler is confident, though, that more providers are going to join.\n\n\"They're going through those numbers, obviously making their own assessment about whether the practice will be better off and whether general practitioners, the GPs that work in their practice, will be better off,\" he told reporters the Monday before the scheme started.\n\n\"Already a couple of thousand of them have indicated that they're going to do that.\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says doctors will be better off under the changes. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"Now, a number of them are already bulk-billing practices but\u2026 almost a thousand of them are practices that this week are charging gap fees, but they've indicated next week they'll be fully bulk billing.\n\n\"I expect there to be a significant number of practices that make that same communication to us over the course of this week before Saturday as well.\"\n\nHe also said he expects the numbers to rise over the coming years and that he was \"delighted\" at the initial level of support.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia Post reveals deadline for mailing Christmas parcels \ufeff\n\nWhat does it mean for doctors?\n\nGPs weren't particularly happy with the 12.5 per cent BBPIP payment being split between doctors and practices, claiming it favours larger corporate clinics and could be a barrier to some providers signing up.\n\nHowever, the government says doctors will be financially far better off under the new system.\n\n\"Two years ago, a full-time, fully bulk-billing GP would have been earning about $280,000 a year after they paid their practice costs,\" Butler said.\n\n\"From this weekend, they'll be earning $405,000 a year, a $125,000 increase.\n\n\"This investment is obviously good for the Medicare system, good for patients, but it's also good for GPs themselves.\"",

(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAward-winning journalist Michael Bachelard admitted he was hesitant to be the one to start the conversation.\n\nThat changed when he heard the stories of real Australian families torn apart by allegations of child abuse based on shaken baby syndrome diagnoses that, according to the parents, just weren't true.\n\n\"It just seemed to me such a clear example of where the medical diagnosis had run ahead of all of the other evidence,\" Bachelard told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"The injustice of it made it seem like I couldn't ignore this.\ufeff\"\n\nWhat is shaken baby syndrome?\n\n\ufeffShaken baby syndrome, also known as abusive or inflicted head trauma, is a medical diagnosis based on research that dates back to the 1970s.\n\nThe original theory was that there may be a link between babies being shaken by their parents and developing subdural haematomas, or bleeding on the brain.\n\nIn the '90s, that theory shifted into a new hypothesis; that parents were knowingly or intentionally harming babies by violently shaking them.\n\n\ufeffShaken baby syndrome, also known as abusive or inflicted head trauma, is intrinsically linked to child abuse accusations. (Getty)\n\nThis formed the basis for shaken baby syndrome, which was diagnosed based on three key clinical findings formally known as \"the triad\":\n\n\ufeffsubdural haemorrhage - a specific kind of bleeding on the brain\n\nretinal haemorrhage - bleeding in the tissue behind the eye\n\nbrain swelling\ufeff\n\nThe diagnosis based on the triad became widely accepted \ufeffand even came to be used as evidence of abuse in court cases.\n\n'There are questions being asked'\ufeff \ufeff\n\nChild abuse is abhorrent and perpetrators should face justice.\n\nBut the science behind shaken baby syndrome and the triad is shaky and unproven, prompting a growing number of \ufeffexperts to question how it is diagnosed and used as evidence in court.\n\n\"We talk about the cost, as we rightly should, of child abuse,\" Bachelard said.\n\n\"But there's also a cost in getting it wrong the other way, in falsely accusing parents or carers of abuse ... and that's a cost we don't often look at.\"\n\nHe explores that cost in \ufeff Diagnosing Murder , a four-part investigative podcast series from The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nDiagnosing Murder is a four-part investigative podcast series from The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. (SMH/The Age)\n\nIn it, he interviews families, lawyers, doctors, and other experts to understand why shaken baby syndrome has faced scrutiny abroad but not in Australia.\n\nEspecially when it can take such a devastating toll on Australian families.\n\n\"\ufeffIt surprised me how the science of shaken baby syndrome, or as people now call it, abusive or inflicted head trauma, began and how it then evolved,\" Bachelard said.\n\n\"And the difficulty of making any firm proof that there is an association between shaking and the medical symptoms and signs that are attributed to it.\"\n\nIt's especially concerning when you consider the number of Australian parents who have found themselves in children's court or facing prosecution over allegations of abuse based on a shaken baby syndrome diagnosis that may not be scientifically sound.\ufeff\n\nThe people who diagnose it or adhere to the current orthodoxy around it are usually well-intentioned.\n\nBut when the science behind these diagnoses isn't accurate, the outcomes can be devastating.\ufeff\n\nMichael Bachelard said the questions arising around shaken baby syndrome are \"something we should all worry about\". (Eddie Jim)\n\n\ufeff\"We should be questioning the science that we rely on in court, particularly when people are either having their children taken away in the children's court, or going on and being prosecuted,\" Bachelard said.\n\n\"We should be open to questions and some of those questions are difficult, but if people are being sent to prison or having their children removed wrongly on a diagnosis that doesn't stack up scientifically, that's terrible.\n\n\"That's something we should all worry about.\"\n\nThe human cost\n\nKabir, Dipika, and their daughter Dua are one such family.\n\nIn 2021, the Melbourne couple rushed their daughter to hospital after she went limp at home and though she recovered, clinical findings led \ufeffforensic doctors to believe she was a victim of shaken baby syndrome.\n\nAs the last person who had held her, Kabir became their prime suspect.\n\nHe was accused of child abuse and Dua was removed from her parents' care despite Kabir's insistence that he was innocent.\ufeff\n\n\"The fact that they were prepared to sit down with me and tell me their stories also shows me how how deep they felt the injustice has been,\" Bachelard said.\n\n\"And the fact that they're prepared to risk exposure and backlash to tell their stories, you know, I was really impressed by their courage.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Searchers draining dam today in renewed search for missing boy Gus\n\nAustralian families have been torn apart by accusations of abuse based on shaken baby syndrome diagnoses.

Source: Department of Health, Disability and Ageing\n\nOnce described as \"Lyme-like illness\", thousands of Australians have reported suffering persistent symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain and neurological problems, they believe to be the result of a tick bite.\n\nIn 2018, the federal Department of Health coined the term DSCATT \u2014 debilitating symptom complexes attributed to ticks \u2014 to recognise these patients, and established clinical recommendations to help doctors manage them.\n\nBut the cause of their symptoms, and how best to treat them, remains highly contested in the medical and scientific community.\n\nEarlier this year, a Senate inquiry found many patients struggled to access care and sometimes spent thousands of dollars, including on unproven testing and treatment, to find answers.\n\n\"Most people in Australia who get a tick bite don't get sick. We're talking about the tip of the iceberg,\" Dr Schloeffel, who has long advocated for patients with tick-bite associated illnesses, said.\n\nBut for those who do report illness, many struggle to feel believed or seen.\n\n\"People bankrupt themselves to find treatment and get diagnosed,\" Dr Schloeffel said.\n\nTicks are parasites that feed on blood from animals and humans. (Pexels: Erik Karits)\n\nFollowing an earlier Senate inquiry in 2016, the federal government awarded funding to Australian researchers to investigate the causes of DSCATT and potential treatments.\n\nScientists have been slowly making inroads, but many questions remain unanswered.\n\nTick-borne diseases in Australia\n\nThere are around 70 species of ticks in Australia, 17 of which bite humans, Peter Irwin, a veterinary scientist and tick researcher at Murdoch University, said.\n\nWhile usually harmless, tick bites can cause a range of illnesses, including allergic reactions, bacterial infections and, less commonly, paralysis.\n\n\"On the east coast of Australia, the main tick is the Australian paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus),\" Professor Irwin said.\n\n\"The other main tick of medical importance is the kangaroo tick (Amblyomma triguttatum), which lives almost all over Australia.\"\n\nBitten by a tick? Here's what to do Ticks can make you really sick, so how do you remove them safely?\n\nAllergies are the most common adverse reaction to tick bites, and range from mild (lasting a few days) to severe (including life-threatening anaphylaxis).\n\nIn some cases, people develop mammalian meat allergy (also known as alpha-gal syndrome) after a tick bite, which results in them no longer being able to eat red meat and other products derived from mammals.\n\nTicks can also carry Rickettsia bacteria, which cause infections including Queensland tick typhus, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Australian spotted fever.\n\nThese infections are most commonly seen in people who live in high-risk areas such as northern Sydney, and are usually treated with a short course of antibiotics.\n\nIs Lyme disease in Australia?\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of Australians have reported suffering debilitating, ongoing symptoms they believe to be the consequence of a tick bite \u2014 but their illnesses cannot be easily diagnosed or treated.\n\nIn some cases, people believe they have contracted Lyme disease, a tick-borne infection commonly found in parts of the US, Europe and Asia, which can sometimes lead to persistent symptoms like severe fatigue, muscle pain and cognitive problems.\n\nBut according to Professor Irwin, there is no evidence that the infection can be acquired in Australia as no Australian ticks have been found to carry Borrelia burdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease.\n\n\"There's nothing difficult about finding Borrelia bacteria overseas, and of course, there is Lyme disease overseas,\" Professor Irwin said.\n\n\"But in Australia \u2026 no-one has ever been able to find Borrelia burgorferi.\"\n\nWhat to know about Justin Timberlake's Lyme disease diagnosis Singer Justin Timberlake reveals his struggle with the disease during his recent world tour.\n\nOther Borrelia species have been identified in Australia, but it is not known whether they can be transmitted to humans by ticks.\n\nWithout local evidence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the diagnosis of locally acquired Lyme disease is not supported by Australian health authorities.\n\nAdding to the challenge is the fact DSCATT symptoms can overlap with other infectious and chronic diseases, and not everyone affected has a clear history of a tick bite.\n\nSymptoms of patients with lingering health issues who do not meet the criteria for a recognised disease or infection are usually deemed \"medically unexplained\" \u2014 and treatment options are limited.\n\n\"What DSCATT guidelines do is \u2026 basically stop any further investigation or treatment being available,\" Dr Schloeffel said.\n\nOne of the recommendations of this year's Senate inquiry was to replace the current DSCATT clinical pathway with new guidelines.\n\n\"That patients continue to experience debilitating and severe symptoms and that patients are left without a diagnosis or treatment plan is of serious concern,\" the final report noted.\n\nSearching for an answer\n\nTo understand what might be causing some people to experience ongoing, \"medically unexplained\" symptoms, Professor Irwin and his colleagues at Murdoch University received funding in 2019 to closely track Australians after they received a tick bite.\n\n\"The idea was to perhaps find which of the Australian microorganisms could be the equivalent of Lyme Borrelia bacteria overseas,\" Professor Irwin said.\n\nThe research team followed 118 people over 12 months, taking blood samples and skin biopsies, and studying the ticks responsible for the bites.\n\n\"We sampled people within 72 hours of a tick bite \u2026 and then again at one week, three months, and 12 months, with the idea we would monitor them for all sorts of things to try to detect patterns, biological processes, infections and so on.\"\n\nDSCATT symptoms include fatigue, headaches, disordered thinking and joint pain. (Pexels: Shivansh Sharma)\n\nThe results of the study, which was delayed by COVID, are due to be peer-reviewed and published in the coming months. But preliminary findings suggest a small number of participants experienced symptoms \"similar to those reported by DSCATT patients\" at 12 months, Professor Irwin said.\n\n\"[They had] migraines, headaches, dizziness \u2014 the sorts of signs that have been attributed to ticks.\"\n\nIn addition to looking for new pathogens, Professor Irwin said the research team was investigating whether known bacteria, viruses and parasites could be causing long-term illness.\n\n\"Some of our patients developed evidence of rickettsial infection, as you'd expect, and we're looking very hard to see whether any of those patients went on to develop DSCATT symptoms,\" he said.\n\n\"The question is: could [an infection] have caused an acute localised or even systematic reaction, and has that triggered \u2014 in some people \u2014 the propensity to develop DSCATT symptoms?\n\n\"That's what we're trying to unravel.\"\n\nDiagnosing and treating an invisible illness\n\nThe question of if \u2014 and how \u2014 tick-borne diseases cause chronic infection, inflammation or other ongoing biological changes is something scientists overseas are also investigating.\n\nThe current uncertainty, and lack of scientific evidence, is why \"chronic Lyme disease\" is a disputed and controversial diagnosis. Instead, health authorities, including the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), use the term \"post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome\" to describe people who experience prolonged symptoms.\n\n\"Chronic Lyme disease \u2026 implies that prolonged symptoms are caused by an ongoing bacterial infection when, in fact, the cause is not currently known,\" the agency noted.\n\nABC Health in your Instagram feed Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.\n\nIn Australia, patients with unexplained chronic symptoms linked to tick bites generally do not show any evidence of infection or irregularities in standard blood tests, Dr Schloeffel said.\n\n\"There's this general belief that if you can't measure something, they look alright and they've tested normal, there is nothing wrong with them.\"\n\nThe former GP believes the lack of pathological evidence is a reflection of inadequate diagnostic testing, not the absence of disease, and is something he is working on trying to improve.\n\n\"The gap in the patient being sick and the doctor's belief that they're sick is the blood test. We don't have to diagnose them,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr Schloeffel, possible mechanisms driving the persistence of symptoms \u2014 which would be missed in standard blood tests \u2014 include infection-induced immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation inside cells.\n\nThrough a privately funded clinical trial at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Dr Schloeffel and his colleagues are monitoring a range of biomarkers in 60 DCSATT patients in the hope of establishing new diagnostic markers and tests.\n\nThey are also evaluating the benefits of treating some patients with low-dose, long-term antibiotics \u2014 a treatment that is not recommended by health authorities in Australia, and described as having \"known harm and no benefit\" in current treatment guidelines.\n\nIn its submission to the 2024 Senate inquiry, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) noted that \"negotiating diagnostic uncertainty\" could be challenging and frustrating for patients, but there was \"little or no evidence to support specific treatments for tick-borne diseases\".\n\n\"We need to be mindful that unnecessary medications, testing or procedures are low-value care and can cause more harm than benefit.\"\n\nFocus on improving quality of life\n\nIn 2019, alongside funding the Murdoch University study, the government also awarded University of Melbourne researchers a grant to investigate whether a psychology-based intervention could help people with DSCATT manage their illness.\n\nRichard Kanaan, a professor of psychiatry and research leader, said the nine-month therapy \u2014 designed to be given in addition to other treatments or supportive care \u2014 was developed with a goal to improve patients' quality of life.\n\nThe intervention was adapted from existing approaches used to help treat other chronic and complex illnesses where the cause was unclear.\n\nPeople with chronic symptoms attributed to ticks are often living in turmoil because their illness cannot be easily diagnosed and treated. (Getty Images: wenjin chen)\n\n\"The treatment is one that has been tried successfully with a number of similar diseases \u2026 where people get an infection, think of the infection itself as being short-lasting, but the after-effects can go on for a long time and be very debilitating,\" Professor Kanaan said.\n\n\"We're not necessarily talking about a cure, because people \u2026 may go on having the illness. But we're talking about improvement.\"\n\nIn coming months, the researchers will assess the feasibility of the intervention they have developed \u2014 which is based on acceptance and commitment therapy \u2014 and evaluate whether it has any therapeutic effects.\n\nProfessor Kanaan said the research team had received some criticism from people with DSCATT concerned about the psychological nature of the treatment \u2014 and implication their illness was being viewed as a \"disease of the mind\", not the body.\n\n\"People are concerned it's being considered a psychiatric illness, and by extension, it's 'all in the head' \u2014 that the illness is being hallucinated or people are making it up,\" he said.\n\n\"I absolutely do not believe that.\"\n\nThe term DSCATT itself has been widely criticised by patients, in part because it defines symptoms as being \"attributed\" to \u2014 rather than caused by \u2014 ticks. This year's Senate inquiry also recommended the term be replaced.\n\nProfessor Kanaan said investigating the benefits of psychological therapy in no way reduced the seriousness of the illness.\n\n\"Why psychiatry is involved is because understanding a complex problem \u2014 it needs a holistic approach,\" Professor Kanaan said.\n\n\"As much as we'd like there to be a very simple explanation \u2026 it doesn't seem to be that kind of problem.\"",

(Supplied: Ask Roz Blue Mountains)\n\nDespite acknowledging that the original WSP report was a \"product of its time,\" Mr Edgecombe said the council would continue with its recommendation to progress new route investigations.\n\n\"We don't have mature enough data and design work in front of us to say that the old Wolgan Road or the new design option is the most cost effective, resilient, long-term and quickest possible pathway to see access restored to this community,\" he said.\n\n\"At some point in the very near future, we will have absolute certainty which of those options is most viable.\"\n\n'Waste of money'\n\nIndependent geologist Marc Hendrickx said the GHD findings demonstrated new road options were redundant.\n\nThe emergency access road known as the Donkey Steps is the only way into the valley. (Supplied: Wolgan Valley Association)\n\n\"It says that the existing road is of a similar risk to many other slopes in the state \u2026 there are management procedures we can put in place to maintain that risk at a reasonable level,\" he said.\n\n\" There seems to be no justification at all for continuing any work on the new routes, and it is just going to be a complete waste of public money to continue to do so. \"\n\nMr Chalk also believed pushing ahead with the new routes was a \"monumental waste of money\".\n\n\"The council still wants to go back and use the same consultants, WSP, that have led us into this great mess,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Edgecombe said he had \"absolute\" confidence in the company to deliver good work.\n\n\"WSP has been assisting the council in the management of the Wolgan Road for nearly two decades,\" he said.\n\n\"[Its report] was authored at a time when the Wolgan Valley had been subject to several years of prolonged and sustained rainfall, and those slopes were actively moving at the time.\"\n\nThe luxury Emirates resort has been mothballed since June 2023 due to the closed road.

        "text": "Today marks the first day of the new fee structure for aged care.\n\nA lot is changing. Self-funded retirees and some pensioners will be expected to pay more, saving the government $12.6 billion over the next 11 years.\n\nResidential care and in-home care will both change.\n\nThe key principle is that the government will continue to pay for health-related costs, but people with financial means will pay more for other costs.\n\nThe changes apply to future recipients only, not to anybody currently receiving care.\n\nThis is how the reform will affect you.\n\nIn-home care\n\nCare in the home will continue to be assessed on the basis of need.\n\nThere will be eight levels of support (instead of four currently), each with a different level of government funding, up to a maximum of $78,000 a year (instead of $60,000 currently).\n\nThat money can be thought of as an annual budget, which can be used to purchase services from an approved list.\n\nWhat your budget can be spent on, versus what you will have to pay out of pocket, depends on your financial means and on the category of service.\n\nThe in-home care changes would see recipients pay more for independence supports and everyday living supports. (ABC News: Hugh Sando)\n\nThere are three categories:\n\nClinical care, such as nursing and occupational therapy\n\nIndependence supports, such as help with showering, dressing and medications\n\nEveryday living supports, such as help with cleaning, gardening and meals\n\nFor clinical care, the government-funded budget can pay for the whole cost.\n\nFor independence supports and everyday living supports, you will be expected to pay some of the cost out of your own pocket, depending on your means (see table below).\n\nYour situation What you will pay for Clinical care Independence support Everyday living Full pensioner 0% 5% 17.5% Part pensioner or health card holder 0% 5-50% 17.5-80% Self-funded retiree 0% 50% 80%\n\nFor the first time, the maximum price of home care services will be set by a government regulator to prevent over-charging.\n\nIn examples provided by the government, a full pensioner approved for level five support would end up paying for 6 per cent of their care, whereas a self-funded retiree who has no Commonwealth Seniors Health Card would pay 42 per cent.\n\nA $25,000 payment will also be available to help recipients spend their final three months at home, and there will be a new 12-week program for help when recovering from an illness or injury.\n\nExisting home care recipients, and those who are already approved, will switch to the new system but have a guarantee that they will not pay any more than they would under the old system.\n\nThe government has also lowered the maximum amount that home care recipients can be required to pay in administrative fees, leaving up to 27 per cent more leftover to spend on care. However, there are fears that providers will increase care prices by even more than 27 per cent.\n\nAdvocates for older Australians have also expressed concern about the way \"non-clinical\" care has been defined, with care recipients expected to make a partial contribution out of their own pockets towards showering and help taking medication, in some instances.\n\nResidential care\n\nThe payment structure for residential care will stay the same, but the amounts will change.\n\nResidents pay in three ways:\n\nA basic daily fee paid by everyone\n\nAn additional daily fee paid by those with financial means\n\nAn accommodation charge, which can be paid daily or as a lump sum deposit\n\nThe basic daily fee, set at 85 per cent of the Age Pension, will not change.\n\nThe means-tested fee will be renamed the \"non-clinical care\" fee, reflecting the fact that the government covers clinical costs.\n\nWhile the government will continue to cover clinical costs, a renamed \"non-clinical\" fee will see some residents pay for food and other amenities. (ABC News: Nance Haxton)\n\nIt will be paid by those with more than $500,000 in assets, or more than about $130,000 in income, or a combination.\n\nIt is a maximum of $101.16 a day and is paid for the first four years of care only.\n\nThe maximum accommodation charge will increase from $550,000 a room to $750,000 a room. Now, providers can seek government approval to charge more.\n\nThis can still be paid as a lump sum deposit, but providers will now be able to hold onto a portion of the deposit: 2 per cent of it each year for five years.\n\nFinally, a $12.55 per day \"hotelling\" supplement, currently paid to providers by the government, will instead be paid by residents with more than $238,000 in assets, $95,400 in income, or a combination.\n\nJust as before, the family home only counts towards the asset assessment up to the value of about $200,000.\n\nIn examples provided by the government, a full pensioner with few savings will continue to pay 17 per cent of the cost of his care, deducted from his pension. A self-funded retiree will pay 45 per cent.\n\nOverall, three in 10 full pensioners will contribute more, and three in four part pensioners.\n\nThis will only apply to those who enter aged care from today.\n\nLifetime cap on fees\n\nNobody will be able to pay more than $130,000 in non-clinical care costs over their lifetime, covering both in-home care and residential care. That is higher than the current cap of about $80,000.\n\nWhy is the government doing this?\n\nAged care is one of the largest and fastest-growing areas of government spending, and the demand for aged care will keep increasing as the large baby boomer cohort gets older.\n\nAt the same time, both sides of politics and the aged care sector agree that existing levels of funding have not been sufficient to deliver the quality of care Australians expect.\n\nIn 2021, the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety recommended a taxpayer-funded levy to boost funding.\n\nBut the government rejected that idea and has argued that residents should pay more if they can afford to do so. The government currently pays about $4 for every $1 paid by aged care residents, and $19 for every $1 paid by in-home care recipients.\n\nThese reforms would see the government pay $3.30 for every $1 paid by residents and $7.80 for every $1 paid by in-home care recipients.\n\nThe government also hopes that by charging more for in-home care, it can afford to provide support to more people and reduce waiting times. According to the most recent figures, 68,000 people are currently on the waitlist for an in-home care package.",

(ABC Riverland: Matt Stephens)\n\nFinal farewell\n\nOne of the benefits of living so far away from each other is the discretion that comes with it, something Ms Hatt cannot always rely on back home.\n\n\"You can tell each other secrets and know very well they're not going to get out in the community,\" she said.\n\nMs Hatt and her husband, Roger, just spent the past month visiting Ms Doevendans's family in South Australia.\n\nDiane and Roger have visited much of South Australia, including Kangaroo Island.

It later became a popular fishing spot for generations of Carnarvon locals and visitors.\n\nBut in 2017, the aging timber structure was declared a safety risk and shut off to the public.\n\nA refurbishment is expected to begin next year, with plans for part of the jetty to be publicly accessible by 2027 \u2014 a decade after it was closed.\n\nWith federal funding going towards a glitzy new waterfront development, locals are disappointed about the jetty's future, but they are not yet giving up on seeing their treasured heirloom shine again.\n\nMemories of sunny days and manta rays\n\nWhen Jamie Venner was growing up, he spent much of his childhood at the jetty.\n\n\"It was an institution for kids growing up in Carnarvon for sure and was a bit of a pretty big tourism draw,\" he said.\n\nJamie Venner says the town's One Mile Jetty was \"an institution\".

        "text": "Most Melburnians are fondly familiar with State Library Victoria's iconic domed reading room, where students study in creaky wooden chairs under green bankers' lamps and tourists circle in the galleries above.\n\nBut hidden in the maze of corridors, electronic security doors, and tunnels below is an unexpected archive of magical treasures.\n\nThe WG Alma Conjuring Collection is home to thousands of books, magazines, posters, memorabilia, scale models and photographs \u2014 all about magic and magicians.\n\n\"It is a bit different to our normal library collections,\" says librarian Jodi Kok.\n\n\"It has books, journals, stuff that you'd expect to find here. But it also has things like posters, tricks, scale models, and [prop] skulls.\"\n\nThe Conjuring Collection contains about 2,000 books on magic, 1,500 photographs, 300 posters and more than 400 detailed research files on individual magicians. ( )\n\nMelbourne-born magic man\n\nWill Alma was a stage magician born in Malvern, Victoria, in 1904. Both his parents were magicians, but after his father left his mother and moved to Hawaii to start a new family, Alma's mother was not keen for her son to follow in his father's footsteps.\n\nBut the boy had already caught the magic bug, and performed his first show at just 15 years of age in the local church.\n\nOriginally named Oswald George William Bishop, the magician changed his name to Will Alma by deed poll in 1949. ( ) Will took after his father, who performed as Alma, the Court Magician. ( ) Will Alma, around 1956, performing his signature trick of swallowing razor blades. ( )\n\nAlma became one of Australia's most well-known magicians of the 20th century, having particular success as a designer and manufacturer of magic tricks, props and devices. The most famous of his customers was \"The Great Levante\" \u2014 a world-renowned illusionist who Alma toured with in the 1940s.\n\nWill Alma was also a certified magic fanboy and prolific collector of conjuring memorabilia.\n\nStream The Art Of... on ABC iview Hosted by Namila Benson, the ABC's bold and vibrant arts and culture show The Art Of\u2026 returns for another season, taking you into the studios, brains and hearts of some of Australia's most exciting creators.\n\nThe book that started it all for Alma was Magic Made Easy by London-born international superstar magician David Devant, published in 1909. This magic manual is among the treasures that Alma accumulated over his life, but many of the items in the collection tell stories from closer to home.\n\nAlma compiled detailed files on hundreds of local magicians, providing invaluable details of the lives and careers of many magicians whose stories may otherwise have gone unrecorded \u2014 his collection now acts as a kind of history of the Australian magic scene.\n\nWomen in magic\n\nFor Australian theatre-goers in the 1900s, The Incomparable Sloggetts would have been a familiar name.\n\nFounded by patriarch Charles Sloggett in 1911, the magic troupe travelled all over the country.\n\n\"Charles toured for about 60 years and during that time he had a number of wives \u2014 not at once!\" says Kok.\n\nThe Sloggetts toured Australia for decades under the slogan, \"everything new except the name!\". ( )\n\n\"And one of his signature tricks was actually decapitating a wife, and the head would roll into the crowd, but would be a cabbage by the time it appeared.\"\n\nHowever, Charles Sloggett's second wife, Athena Pallas, was not content to just be decapitated on stage night after night.\n\nThree of Sloggett's four wives were magicians in their own right, and Pallas was possibly the first professional solo female magician in Australian history. She was skilled at conjuring, mind reading, snake charming and even ventriloquism.\n\nAlma had noticed that most of the Sloggett material didn't mention Pallas, so he wrote to her directly to create a file on her; their correspondence is part of the collection.\n\n\"She talks about having a really hard life touring with Charles,\" explains Kok.\n\n\"She had two children with him; he had other children. So she was looking after children, she was baking bread for them, she was making butter, she was driving everywhere, looking after the animals.\n\n\"She even made the tents that they would sometimes take with them if they performed in a place that didn't have a town hall.\"\n\nPallas left Sloggett in 1941 and went on to pursue her own career.\n\nAthena Pallas was a skilled conjurer, ventriloquist and snake charmer. ( )\n\nBut the lives and careers of 20th-century female magicians and assistants are often sidelined in what has traditionally been a male-dominated profession.\n\nIndeed, as Jodi Kok explains, many tricks and tropes of traditional stage conjuring take a decidedly gendered tone.\n\nThe famous \"buzz saw illusion\" \u2014 in which a male magician saws a glamorous assistant in half live on stage \u2014 is a particularly enduring trope.\n\nFirst staged by English magician PT Selbit in 1921, the trick appeared to become political in the years after women won the right to vote.\n\n\"One of his gimmicks was he actually offered to pay the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst to appear on stage and be sawn in half. She did not agree,\" says Kok.\n\nPT Selbit performing his \"sawing a woman in half trick\". ( )\n\n\" There was something around the culture there that I think was maybe a little misogynistic \u2026 It always seems to be a woman who's sawn in half. \"\n\nThe bequest\n\nWhen Will Alma died at the age of 89 in 1993, his vast collection was bequeathed to State Library Victoria \u2014 but not without several stipulations.\n\nOne is that the collection always be referred to as a \"conjuring\" collection, rather than a \"magic\" collection.\n\n\"I think the word conjuring is really important,\" says Jodi Kok.\n\n\"It's not occult stuff, even though some tricks sort of use that spiritual language, that's not what it's about.\"\n\nThe sawing in half trick was a turning point in the history of magic, heralding a more sensational and shocking style. ( )\n\nAnother stipulation of the bequest was that whenever items are exhibited, the library must do so in a way that does not give away trade secrets to the public en masse.\n\n\"But the great thing about this collection is, if you wanted to know how [a trick] was done, you could come in, look at the books, the journals [\u2026] and you could study up and find out,\" she says.\n\n\"But then you'd need to find a woman who was willing to be sawn in half.\"\n\nWatch the new season of The Art of... free on ABC TV and ABC iview.",

        "text": "It was the subtlest of changes that few noticed \u2014 the appearance of two new microphones on the crossbench of the ACT Legislative Assembly.\n\nThey emerged in the hours after Elizabeth Lee and Peter Cain were suspended from the Canberra Liberals party room.\n\nWhen it became clear Ms Lee and Mr Cain remained committed to their party, albeit on the outer, the microphones were promptly removed after just a day.\n\nBut it was a stark reminder; anything can happen in politics.\n\nAnd after the events of this week, Ms Lee, the party's former leader, and Mr Cain, a former shadow minister, feel closer to the crossbench than ever before.\n\nThe unlikely vote that caused tensions to boil over\n\nThere's been simmering tensions within the Canberra Liberals for some time.\n\nLiberal party room indefinitely suspends former leader, backbencher Two backbenches have been suspended indefinitely from the Canberra Liberals party room.\n\nThe decision to suspend the two backbenchers came almost exactly a year to the day from Leanne Castley's successful tilt for the party's leadership \u2014 despite previously having assured Ms Lee of her support.\n\nIt also came just months after Mr Cain quit shadow cabinet, citing concerns over the party's leadership and alluding to issues around workplace culture.\n\nIt's been a matter of when, not if, the tensions were going to come to a head.\n\nBut it was an unlikely, largely procedural vote on the assembly's sitting calendar for next year that was the final straw.\n\nThe long-held Liberal principle?\n\nMs Lee and Mr Cain voted differently to their party colleagues \u2014 wanting to preserve the number of sitting weeks for next year at 13, rather than dropping to 12.\n\nAnd, in so doing, exercised a long Liberal tradition of being able to cross the floor.\n\nPeter Cain said he was incredibly surprised to be suspended from the party room. (ABC News: Toby Hunt)\n\nIn the words of Liberal senator Sarah Henderson: \"Being able to cross the floor is a very important principle in the Liberal Party\".\n\nBut it appears, on the face of it, doing just that saw Ms Castley banish Ms Lee and Mr Cain from her party room.\n\nWhat makes this situation more perplexing is Ms Castley's past comments saying backbenchers were indeed allowed to cross the floor.\n\n\"Well, as backbenchers, they have that opportunity of course,\" she told ABC's Stateline in September.\n\nThe missing leader\n\nLeanne Castley has so far refused to explain why the backbenchers were suspended. (ABC News: Stuart Carnegie)\n\nOther than two brief written statements, Ms Castley has been silent on the matter.\n\nThe ABC attempted to get answers from her as she arrived at the assembly on Thursday morning \u2014 almost 48 hours on from her decision.\n\n\"I will not talk about party room stuff with you today,\" Ms Castley said.\n\nBut when asked if the custom of allowing Liberal backbenchers to cross the floor was not the case in the Canberra Liberals, she responded: \"Of course it is the case in the Canberra Liberals.\"\n\nIt's a response that raises far more questions.\n\nIt also alludes, rather strongly, that there is something much greater at play here.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe longer Ms Castley stays silent, the more attention the feud gathers.\n\nAnd while she is silent, the space is being filled by Ms Lee and Mr Cain's side of the story \u2014 they've fronted the media several times to explain their version of events.\n\nMs Castley insists she won't be making any public comments, saying \"litigating these issues publicly is not helpful in showing a commitment to restoring trust.\"\n\nBut it's hard to see how staying silent is helping Canberrans build trust in her party and her as the ACT's alternative chief minister.\n\nLabor's bad day overshadowed\n\nLabor's Chris Steel was also not having a good day on Thursday. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nIn Ms Castley's statement on Thursday, she noted herself: \"The events of this week have, unfortunately, diverted attention from the issues that matter most to the people of the ACT.\"\n\nAnd, in an own goal for the Liberals, a perfect example of attention being diverted from where it should have been was presented that same day.\n\nCanberrans already knew the launch of the government's MyWay+ ticketing system was plagued by software bugs and hardware issues, but a scathing report by an assembly committee laid bare the shortcomings.\n\nTransport Minister Chris Steel was censured by the assembly over the part he played in the rollout.\n\nIt was the first time the assembly had censured an MLA since 2011.\n\nThe censure carries no ongoing consequences aside from reputational damage, but the damage done this week felt like a bit of a blip amongst the implosion of the opposition.\n\nHowever, with the Greens out of a formal coalition with Labor, Mr Steel's censure is evidence of the new makeup of the assembly at play.\n\nWe can expect to see more of this.\n\nUnknown path ahead\n\nThere's a whole month before the assembly next sits \u2014 the last sitting week of the year.\n\nBut before then, Liberal MLAs are due to meet to attempt to resolve their internal issues.\n\nElizabeth Lee says she still remains faithful to the Liberal Party. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nIt's hard to know what happens from there \u2014 even if Ms Lee and Mr Cain are allowed back into the party room, it would be an extremely awkward environment.\n\nSo awkward it would almost certainly be unworkable.\n\nBut if the Canberra Liberals ever want to be seen as a viable alternative to Labor in the ACT, they'll want to quickly put this saga behind them.\n\nRight now, it's hard to see how they'll do that.",

        "text": "On the rolling plains of southern Tasmania, historian Alan Townsend is working hard to preserve what was once a grand homestead on a sprawling agricultural farm in the 1800s.\n\nThe Lonsdale Homestead, near Kempton, was built in 1821 and sold to the Johnson family in 1854.\n\nJane Johnson was the matriarch of the homestead, and her diaries are helping Alan Townsend document the property's history. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nHistory traced through account books\n\nCracks are beginning to show at Tasmania's Woolmers Estate In northern Tasmania, Woolmers Estate is recognised for its heritage charm. But buckets to catch drips and cracks in walls show how that could change.\n\nUsing the diaries of the matriarch Jane Johnson, the farm's account books and original photographs, Mr Townsend has pieced together what life was like at Lonsdale.\n\n\"One thing that really comes across clearly is this lady likes hard work \u2026 up at 4am, washing, making jam, just crazy hard work,\" he said.\n\nMr Townsend said the Lonsdale farm had sheep, cropped hay and a working orchard.\n\nAlan Townsend has been restoring Lonsdale Homestead in Kempton, Tasmania, since 2003. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\n\"Farms like this were essentially small towns in their own right, entirely aimed at producing food, not just for the family, but for the farm labourers,\" he said.\n\nMr Townsend said the accounting books showed workers were paid in both cash and goods.\n\n\"When you look at each week, when the men were getting paid, it'll be things like two shillings cash and one bottle of gin, one ounce tobacco, sugar, flour,\" he said.\n\nMr Townsend said if a maid dropped a saucer, a record would be kept, and it would be deducted from her pay.\n\nHe said the property, which he now owns, was a lot smaller than the original Lonsdale farm.\n\nLonsdale Homestead carriage works are still intact. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\n\"A lot of ex-convicts were given grants of 50 acres or so, and they could not only feed their family off that, but they could make a profit,\" Mr Townsend said.\n\nHe said the last Johnson to farm here was in the 1980s.\n\n\"Basically, 700 acres just wasn't enough to make a living off anymore,\" Mr Townsend said.\n\n\" You could feed yourself and your family, but that's about it, so inevitably farms like this ended up being subsumed into larger farms. \"\n\nThe homestead is also still home to the original coach house and stables, which once held up to six horses at a time.\n\nThe original coach house and stables once held up to six horses. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nMr Townsend said Ms Johnson's diaries were full of tidbits \u2014 including recounting a story of a horse losing a shoe at Bridgewater, north of Hobart.\n\n\"It's the equivalent of like puncturing a tyre,\" Mr Townsend said.\n\nChance find helps bring house to life\n\nAlan Townsend said there was \"about a gazillion to one\" chance of the clock belonging to the Johnson farm when he bought it at auction. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nMr Townsend, who is the history projects officer at the Southern Midlands Council, has been restoring the property since he purchased it in 2003 for $146,000.\n\nOne of his favourite features is in the dining room.\n\nIt is a framed clock, sitting boldly on a mantelpiece.\n\nColonial-era solitary cells unearthed below council pool Tiny cells unearthed below an old swimming pool in the Tasmanian town of Oatlands shine a light on the \"miserable existence\" endured by inmates who were once imprisoned at the site.\n\n\"I came across it at auction during COVID times \u2026 I couldn't actually look at it in person, but I just took a chance because I recognised it,\" he said.\n\nWhen the clock arrived, it had \"Johnson Lonsdale\" written on the back.\n\nThe odds were \"about a gazillion to one\", Mr Townsend said.\n\nThe kitchen, with its original large fireplace and ceilings, paints a portrait of the segregation between the family and the servants at the time.\n\nIt leads to the back of the homestead, which is a stark contrast to the grandeur of the front of the home, which is led to by a winding driveway lined with elk trees.\n\nThe homestead has its original large fireplace in the kitchen. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\n\"It is kind of about showing off, about saying, 'we've arrived and we're solid, respectable people', which you know is not entirely the case, but it was a good pitch,\" he said.\n\nHistorical buildings open to public\n\nOver the first weekend of November, homes across the southern midlands, including Lonsdale Homestead, will be open for the public to explore.\n\nThe Open House program runs across the world, but in a collaboration with the Southern Midlands Council and Australian Institute of Architects, it is opening up buildings outside of Hobart in southern Tasmania for the first time.\n\nMr Townsend said there were some \"pretty amazing properties there\".",

(Supplied)\n\nAustralia's work and holiday visa (WHV) scheme is designed to bring young people into Australia to fill workplace shortages in critical sectors, like meat processing.\n\nHowever, advocates have raised concerns about the working conditions for participants such as Mr Munthe.\n\nAnd incidents discovered by the ABC have raised questions about whether employers are taking advantage of foreign workers' ignorance to skirt safety regulations.\n\nA report titled Backpacker Dispatches released earlier this month from the Migrant Workers Centre said the WHV scheme was functioning as a \"de facto low-wage migration stream\".\n\nIt lacked the safeguards, employment pathways and oversight that typically accompany formal labour migration programs, the report said.\n\nReport author Lea Knopf, who was herself on the visa for more than two years, said WHV holders were exposed to \"a higher risk of an injury\" due to the kinds of jobs they tended to fill.\n\nShe said they were also not given enough information on work safety and training.\n\nJaya Munthe broke his leg on his first day back at work after recovering from another injury. (Supplied)\n\nMr Munthe moved from Indonesia to NSW at the end of 2024 to try to earn a better wage and save money for later in life.\n\nHe found work at the Southern Meats abattoir in Goulburn, but just a few months later, in March, he fractured his left hand while lifting a heavy box of lamb meat in the abattoir's cold room.\n\n\"My co-worker pushed the box too hard from the other side, causing the corner of the box to hit my hand,\" he said.\n\n\"It was very painful.\"\n\nHe took two weeks off and then had the second accident the day he returned.\n\nHe had to undergo surgery on his leg and was off work for another three months.\n\nMr Munthe, who worked in industrial engineering in Indonesia, said equipment at the abattoir was not properly maintained.\n\nHowever, the true cause of the accident remains unknown because, according to the authorities, it was never investigated.\n\nReport author Lea Knopf says working holiday-makers face a greater risk of injury at work. (Supplied)\n\nWHV holders reluctant to report issues\n\nAny serious injury, illness or death that occurs while at work is supposed to be reported to the workplace health and safety authority \u2014 SafeWork NSW.\n\nBut a spokesperson told the ABC it \"has not received notification of an alleged incident\" relating to Mr Munthe.\n\nCompanies can be fined up to $50,000 for not notifying SafeWork NSW of incidents involving serious injury, illness or death.\n\nMr Munthe said he told his manager at the agency through which he had found the job, and they helped arrange an insurance claim that covered his medical treatment and wages \u2014 but they never informed the authorities.\n\nSouthern Meats was contacted by the ABC about Mr Munthe's case, but declined to comment.\n\nMr Munthe was surprised to find out his former employer had not reported his case to the safety authority.\n\n\"Maybe they want to maintain a good track record, but if there are already too many accidents, I think they should report them in accordance with the law,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Munthe said he was not planning to take the matter further.\n\nAfter suffering two injuries, he decided the workload and risks of working at the abattoir were not worth it.\n\nHe now works at a supermarket in Goulburn.\n\n\"I don't think I will report this case because I have resigned,\" he said.\n\n\" But the company is still in the wrong. \"\n\nA spokesperson for NSW Minister for Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis told the ABC that Mr Munthe would have to report the incident before SafeWork NSW would be able to look into it.\n\n\"Every worker has the right to go to work and return home safely at the end of the day,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nDo you know more? If you have any information about a story, contact Natasya Salim or Erwin Renaldi.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs granted 321,116 working holiday-maker visas from July 2024 to the end of June 2025.\n\nTypically, the visas last for up to three years and can be renewed every 12 months.\n\nTo extend the visa for another year, holders are required to work within the farming, hospitality, mining or construction sectors in regional areas for at least three months.\n\nAustralian employers deliberately taking advantage of their vulnerability, UN official says Temporary migrant workers in Australia are facing \"disturbing\" patterns of exploitation from some employers, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, has warned after touring Australia.\n\nIt was established in 1975 for young participants \u2014 especially for eligible individuals from Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\nSince then, the list of countries under the WHV program has grown to at least 40.\n\nYoung participants often seek a WHV for financial reasons, Ms Knopf said.\n\nShe said many WHV participants were reluctant to report incidents of harassment or any workplace rights violations because they feared their employers could cancel their visas.\n\nUnions NSW assistant secretary Thomas Costa told the ABC \"it's very common for employers of migrant workers\" not to report injuries in their workplace.\n\nThomas Costa says it is common for companies that employ migrants not to report injury cases. (Supplied)\n\nHe said that could be because they were trying \"to avoid inspections from the regulator because they are engaging in unsafe work practices\".\n\n\"It's very, very sad that there are some employers out there that are willing to put profits before people's safety,\" he said.\n\nWhen a relevant injury case was not reported, Mr Costa said the regulators, who were there to ensure that workplaces met safety standards, were not able to investigate and inspect the company.\n\nAccording to a Department of Home Affairs spokesperson, another visa was being trialled that allowed workers to extend their stay in Australia while they \"pursue workplace justice\" to help WHV holders who fear the consequences of reporting unsafe practices.\n\nWorking holiday-makers can extend visas by working in farming, hospitality, mining, or construction in regional areas. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nLack of proper training\n\nWith Australia increasing the WHV quota for young Indonesians to 5,000 per year, the visa has become popular among the country's gen Z workers, especially amid a shortage of decent job opportunities and fair wages back home.\n\nAini Rodianto is a WHV holder from Indonesia who worked in an abattoir in Victoria for about a year.\n\nShe said in April 2024, her co-worker accidentally poured nearly boiling water on her while they were cleaning.\n\nAini Rodianto was injured while working in an abattoir. (Supplied)\n\n\"When I realised they were standing too close to me, I shouted,\" she said.\n\n\"They didn't notice, and before I knew it, the boiling water had entered my boots, which went up to my calves.\"\n\nShe was hospitalised for a week and had surgery on her legs to replace the skin, especially on the most injured parts \u2014 her ankle and heel.\n\nMs Rodianto said that her monthly pay and the treatment costs were covered by her work agency, but she has had to live with permanent burn scars.\n\nMs Rodianto was injured by boiling water at her workplace. (Supplied)\n\nShe said the work safety in her company \"was not 100 per cent good\" due to the lack of facilities and staff, which often forced people to overwork.\n\nThe co-worker who injured her had not been properly trained to clean the floor as it was not in their job description, Ms Rodianto said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the authorities were properly notified about Ms Rodianto's accident.\n\nA WorkSafe Victoria spokesperson said they were unable to comment on individual cases.\n\nMs Rodianto said she had heard of other WHV participants being injured at her former workplace.\n\n\"No matter how much we try to stay safe, there is always that risk \u2026 because our job is a bit dangerous,\" she said.\n\nMs Rodianto quit in September and moved to Queensland to study.\n\nHowever, she requested that the ABC not name the company to avoid any future repercussions.\n\nOther WHV holders working in Melbourne meat factories have told the ABC similar stories.\n\nOne abattoir worker, who wanted to stay anonymous, said they were made to work at a dangerously high pace, but during inspections, management would lower the machine's speed to normal to avoid being caught breaking the rules.\n\nThey also said machines were outdated and \"rusty\", and that workers were not properly trained on how to use knives.\n\nOne abattoir worker said they were made to work at a dangerously high pace. (ABC News: Erwin Renaldi)\n\nNo data collected on WHV incidents\n\nFederal statutory agency Safe Work Australia told ABC they did not have specific information on work-related injuries suffered by working holiday visa holders or migrants.\n\n\"Data on the claimant's visa status, or their country of birth or year of arrival in Australia, is not collected as part of the claims process,\" a Safe Work Australia spokesperson said.\n\nMs Knopf said this needed to change.\n\nShe also suggested the government introduce a more regulated labour program to replace the current model of the WHV.\n\nAssociate professor in Public Policy at the University of Sydney Anna Boucher said visa holders should be given training in their home countries.\n\n\"Because then people are aware of these basic rights before they come into the country and can negotiate with the employer,\" Dr Boucher said.\n\nAnna Boucher says migrants may not be aware of their rights. (Supplied)\n\nShe also suggested more involvement of unions for WHV workers.\n\nMs Rodianto emphasised the \"enormous\" contributions working holiday-makers made to Australia's economy.\n\n\"We work selflessly,\" she said.",

        "text": "During busy times of the day, council rubbish trucks experience congestion at the Ravenhall tipping face, which jeopardises their ability to complete bin pick-up cycles across the city, Cleanaway argues. The company says the cap also gives the tip\u2019s operators less time to compact piles of waste, which means the landfill is filling up more quickly. \u201cThe landfill cells have a shorter lifespan than planned,\u201d the company said in its latest proposal, adding that the density of waste in each landfill cell has reduced by 12 per cent since 2019 because machine operators are getting less time to compact it. The expanded tipping face would only be used at times of high demand, when there is a logjam of council waste trucks, the company argues. It claims the expansion will bring environmental benefits because the landfill will be able to accept more rubbish and trucks will not have to idle for long periods. The EPA has twice refused to give Cleanaway\u2019s proposed two-year pilot project a green light. An EPA assessment submitted to VCAT as part of the hearing details the environmental watchdog\u2019s opposition to Cleanaway\u2019s proposal, including its rejection of the company\u2019s claim that a two-year tipping face expansion could credibly be called a trial.\n\n\u201cThe concept proposed by the applicant does not seek to engage in a genuine activity of research, demonstration or development as it is not seeking to assess a new concept,\u201d the EPA says in its statement of claims. Instead, Cleanaway hopes to expand its tip operation \u201cwithout providing any system to determine an optimum tipping face size that adequately mitigates against environmental risks\u201d. The EPA argues that there are \u201cfour tangible risks to human health and the environment\u201d if Cleanaway expands its operation: more litter; more vermin and disease vectors; more risk of landfill fires; and increased odour. First in the line of impact from an expanded landfill operation would be inmates of the Dame Phyllis Frost remand centre, just 200 metres away. The EPA argues inmates\u2019 human rights could be breached due to impacts from odour, litter and vermin.\n\n\u201cThe neighbouring correctional facility may be impacted due to close proximity and the inability for inmates to be removed from the facility if impacted by odour. Vermin fouling roofs may also compromise security monitoring equipment,\u201d it said. The EPA also argues the bigger tipping face would cause a spike in the local seagull population. The Ravenhall tip is already home to thousands of silver gulls, and the EPA says a surge in their numbers would damage nearby property and threaten the survival of other bird species. \u201cEPA considers the trial will increase the quantity of exposed waste on site due to the larger tipping faces which will increase the availability of food for vermin, in turn attracting more vermin to the site.\u201d Site inspections by EPA officers suggest the company already struggles to control litter escaping from the landfill or to manage the seagull population, the authority said.\n\nCleanaway breached its tipping face cap 24 times between June 2021 and April 2025, according to EPA records. The EPA\u2019s stance drew fire from Peter Anderson, chief executive of industry group the Victorian Waste Management Alliance, who accused it of being obstructionist, instead of helping Cleanaway solve the problem. Anderson said Melbourne was running low on landfill capacity and Cleanaway was trying to find answers. \u201cMelbourne is getting bigger, and it\u2019s producing more waste, and we are getting less holes in the ground. Why doesn\u2019t the EPA work with Cleanaway for a better solution, rather than just building walls?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the community in the end that will suffer because they won\u2019t be able to get rid of their rubbish, or it\u2019s going to cost more and more to move it somewhere else.\u201d Melton Mayor Steve Abboushi said residents in nearby Mt Atkinson had already complained to the council about landfill odour. \u201cThe community is deeply concerned about what this application means in terms of the environmental effects, especially given this tip is very close to a number of our housing estates,\u201d Abboushi said. \u201cWe hold concerns about what this means in real terms for our residents.\u201d Loading",

The Ashes has arrived and the top-order will consist of a 38-year-old converted first-drop and \u2026 and who?\n\nEqually, letting Warner go on and on when Australia could have been cultivating new top-order batsmen might have been the selectorial chicken that was always going to come home to roost in the 2025-26 Ashes.\n\nMaybe David Warner was right, and the Australian selectors really did have to put up with the mediocrity of his declining years because there was no-one better.\n\nIn the 15 Test matches since Warner took his chosen bow, Usman Khawaja has changed partners like a square dancer: six swapsies. He took four turns around the floor with Steve Smith (average partnership 21.75), three with Nathan McSweeney (19.8), two with Sam Konstas (39.25), two with Travis Head (54, when Head was a horse for a Sri Lankan course), one with Marnus Labuschagne (20) and finally back with Konstas for another three (18.3). During that time, Australia has lost its first wicket, on average, with 26 runs on the board.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the average opening stand in Warner\u2019s last 15 Test matches was 34.2. There were days when Australia being none for 100 at lunch on the first day of an Ashes series felt a bit boring. This summer, only optimists are forecasting one for 34 by drinks.\n\nCredit: Simon Letch\n\nThe names of Khawaja\u2019s dance partners, post-Warner, say as much as their figures. Smith, McSweeney, Head and Labuschagne were all playing out of position (as was Khawaja when he returned to the Test team four years ago). Only Konstas was an opener, though he did everything possible not to look like one. He was lumped with the unrealistic expectations of Australian magical thinking. If Bradman, Ponting, Walters and Steve Waugh were good enough for Test cricket when barely drinking age \u2026 yup.\n\nSince they started watching the Sheffield Shield again around 2024, the selectors must have been wondering what kind of game this was and where all the openers had gone. They awarded Marcus Harris a central contract just before his batting position, and his stats, dropped down the Victorian order. Jake Weatherald has been consistent, but his career average is, like his age, in the 30s. At his big audition this week he made a third-ball duck and 12. The urgers keep saying Konstas is one innings away when he looks more like he\u2019s three years away. Henry Hunt, Campbell Kellaway, McSweeney \u2013 one of them is looking great one week, out cheaply to a Jackson Bird or a Matthew Kelly the next.",

When you reconsider and redeploy the capital that you manage, our objective is for Australia to be the most obvious and the most compelling place to put it to work. When you run the numbers, when you test risk, return and reliability, our goal is for Australia to be at the very top of your models.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nQueenslanders are being warned to brace for a volatile weekend, with forecasters predicting severe thunderstorms, destructive winds, and giant hail across much of the state\u2019s south-east.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says conditions are likely to worsen today [[Saturday]], which is shaping up to be the most dangerous day of the current weather system.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas stretching from Charters Towers down to the New South Wales border and as far west as Charleville are expected to be hit, with widespread rainfall of 40 to 100 millimetres and the risk of flash flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteorologist Jonathan How.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So Saturday, we see the area of severity very much expands all the way from the mid north-coast of New South Wales and up into the central highlands of Queensland and inland to many communities through there. Importantly, we have a very large area where severe thunderstorms are likely. This includes Brisbane, parts of the Gold Coast, Sunshine coast and inland communities like Toowoomba, Dalby and Kingaoy and down towards Glen Innes and Moree in northern parts of New South Wales.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe warning comes as the family of 21-year-old Finlay Bones, struck by lightning on the Sunshine Coast earlier this week, remembered her as a beautiful, kind and caring young woman taken in the prime of her life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations has urged safe passage for civilians fleeing Sudan\u2019s paramilitary forces in Darfur and protection for those still trapped in El-Fasher.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefugees arriving at a nearby camp after days on foot told aid workers that roads were strewn with bodies, amid reports of hundreds killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces had besieged El-Fasher, the army\u2019s last stronghold in Darfur, for 500 days before seizing control.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN migration agency says more than 36,000 people have fled since Sunday many at night on foot.\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite images suggest an earthen wall built by the R-S-F now traps residents inside what observers call a kill box.\n\n\n\n\n\nSawsan Mukhtar, a Sudanese-Australian journalist based in Adelaide and originally from Al-Fashir, spoke to SBS Arabic and describes the dire conditions there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Rapid Support Forces control the entrances to the city, so it\u2019s difficult to bring in food.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, almost one in four Australians speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report by SBS and the University of Canberra that looks into sense of belonging and media representation among multilingual Australia has found the majority of them feel like they belonged to Australia, but less than half of them feel they can have influence over Australian society.\n\n\n\n\n\nThu Nguyen is a co-author of the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has told SBS Vietnamese that factors such as residency status, media representation and English proficiency can contribute to the overall sense of belonging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are variation and nuances across different language community because of their status in Australia, because of their dynamics in terms of demographics, and time of settlement in Australia, however the most consistent factor that has influence on community sense of belonging is probably English proficiency, or their confidence in their English language. We found people that are more fluent in English are more likely to feel they belonged, feel at home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report is a follow-up on the same survey in 2023, but this time it interviewed over 1,800 respondents across seven languages, including Arabic, Cantonese, Italian, Mandarin, Punjabi, Vietnamese and English.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows that while compared to the same survey done in 2023, there's an increased sense of belonging as more people feel their needs being met and their community members caring each other - there are still challenges to overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also indicates a generational divide, showing younger multilingual respondents are more likely to engage in national and global issues compared to older generation, but also less likely to agree that their cultural communities are fairly represented by media.\n\n\n\n\n\nPunjabi speakers were interviewed for the first time in this series of surveys - and the report has they have the highest sense of belonging across other cohorts, while Mandarin speakers feels the least connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThu Nguyen says one of them is media representation of multicultural communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of representation in the media and in the news, they are however more critical about feeling fairly represented, covered in the media. And we know, from the previous research, again, the finding this time confirm there's such a strong connection between feeling represented in the media in the news and feeling that they belong in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also sheds light on a concept known as collective efficacy, which refers to the belief on the impacts of people's own cultural or language community can have on Australian society.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows those who have stronger belief in their own collectives are more likely to engage in civic participation, such as volunteering, joining protests, and voting in elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while two-third of multilingual Australians have at least one civic engagement, their participation can be uneven.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report finds Mandarin and Punjabi speakers reported the highest civic participation rates, while Cantonese speakers reported the lowest, at 49 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-author Rebecca Griffiths, who's also the Audience Research Lead at SBS, has told SBS Arabic there is still a lot to do.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil her mid-eighties, Lee Hodgson was fit, healthy and engaged with the community through the Older Women's Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was State President of Queensland for six years. I ran a branch in Gympie for 13 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut last year, aged 85, she underwent radiotherapy for a cancer affecting her nose - and this year she suffered a heart attack requiring a series of operations, from which she is still recovering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith her husband Andrew also suffering from chronic health conditions, she says, everyday tasks like cleaning the house, or even having a shower, have become difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really puts a lot of stress on your mental health, on your, what you're dealing with - your health, the problem you're dealing with. You get anxious. You get irritable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee and Andrew were first assessed for in-home support at the start of last year before she fell ill.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was assessed again after her cancer treatment - and yet again recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says the two hours a fortnight of cleaning services she eventually received not enough, and even that support is irregular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You pay your taxes all your life. And when you get to this age here I am needing some help for the first time in my life and we can't get it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an ageing population, Australia is facing skyrocketing demand for aged care services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Treasury, within 40 years, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected double, and the number of people aged over 85 will triple.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Gear, the CEO of the Older Persons Advocacy Network or OPAN [[o-pan]], says that presents governments with a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fantastic in Australia that we have an aging population and we have more older people around. But we need to make sure that we've provided a financial system and a financially viable aged care system that some of the levers in this new act help contribute to that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Saturday the 1st of November, sweeping reforms to aged care will come into effect, under the new Aged Care Act which passed parliament a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're the long-awaited result of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Safety and Quality, which delivered its final report in 2021, to repair a system which many saw as broken.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has already acted on some recommendations of the Royal Commission - such as increasing wages for aged care workers, and boosting supervision of residents in nursing homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Gear says the changes represent an new approach to aged care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the New Aged Care Act does is one, it does bring in improved quality standards, which the Royal Commission said was way needed into the aged care system. It also provides greater protections for older people through greater powers of the regulator. It brings a statement of rights that providers have a positive duty to actually uphold the human rights of older people, and it also allows older people to continue to make the decisions for themselves through the supported decision-making framework.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, there is much anxiety in the community, the sector and among advocates about the new funding model.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new Aged Care Act, the current system of Home Care Packages will be replaced by the new Support at Home program, which will require users to fund more of their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green party's spokesperson for older people, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, says the system will benefit private providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This week the [[Aged Care]] Minister was out saying how the profits of Aged Care Providers are up. The Minister is celebrating increasing profits for aged care providers, while older people are going to pay the cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new system, clinical services such as nursing and physiotherapy will be covered by the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut recipients will need to make co-payments for non-clinical services, at a rate determined by their income and assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor personal care such as showering, help with medication, transport, or home modifications, a full pensioner will pay 5 per cent of the cost of the services.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart pensioners and self-funded retirees could pay up to 50 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September, the independent Aged Care Inspector-General Natalie Siegel-Brown reported that older people could forgo having a shower or washing clothes because they couldn't afford to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany advocates, like Older Women\u2019s Network National President Beverly Baker, say older people should not be charged for help with showering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are an older woman, you know that showers are really vital for your personal health wellbeing and basically your capacity to look after yourself. But if you are in danger of falling over in the shower or having an accident in the shower and you need support to have a shower that's viewed as personal. That's not personal, that's medical, it should be under clinical care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor what's considered everyday living services - such as cleaning, gardening and meal preparation - older people will have to pay even more - 17.5 per cent for a full pensioner and up to 80 per cent for part pensioners and self-funded retirees.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose already assessed for or receiving Home Care Packages before the 12th of September 2024, will not have to pay more - and contributions for non-clinical services will be capped at $130,000 over a lifetime for everybody.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeverly Baker says many older people cannot afford those costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will be a major impact, especially if those women are renting - how on earth? - they're already struggling to pay rent. How on earth are they going to pay extra for services? User-pay is not a good approach, and baby boomers aren't all rich.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also concern the changes will not meet growing demand by people like Lee, who want to age at home, so they can stay connected and contribute to the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Australia, there are some 200,000 people either waiting to be assessed or to receive aged care support in their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has committed to release 83,000 new funded Support at Home places, by the middle of next year - and has already brought forward funding for 20,000 new places.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also promised to bring wait times for Support at Home packages down to an average of three months - by 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Reid is the Chief Operating Officer of Uniting NSW.ACT, which provides residential and home care aged services.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is calling for the government to release twice as many new Support at Home places, saying long wait times for at-home care creates pressures on hospitals and residential aged care systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're seeing is pressure on residential aged care. We know our occupancy in that sector is very high, but also to on our hospitals, we know that there are a number of hospitals around the country which are experiencing delayed discharge, where people are languishing in hospitals for long periods of time and do not have access to either residential aged care or to return home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that leads to the issue of availability and funding for Residential Aged Care.\n\n\n\n\n\nA government review of the current pricing system for residential aged care, such as nursing homes, is underway; looking at the government subsidy for people entering care who can't afford to pay a large refundable lump sum to aged care providers for non-clinical costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new Aged Care Act, providers will be able to charge more for the refundable accommodation deposit - to those who can afford it, putting those who can't at a potential disadvantage, in a system that's nearly at full capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Gear - from OPAN - says people with complex needs - or lower means - can find it difficult to find residential care.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says, that's not good enough.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "When Mel and her friends were in their 20s, they would experiment with recreational drug use , including Gamma hydroxybutyrate \u2014 or GHB.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross long weekends of music and partying in the early to mid-2000s, the depressant became a drug of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile GHB's potential to produce strong sedative effects cemented its reputation as a 'date rape drug' in the early 2000s, Mel says she would adhere to strict rules around it to avoid these effects: she would not drink alcohol while taking GHB, she would use a precise dropper for dosages and always make a note on her phone to clock the time and the amount taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was always a trepidatious person when it came to recreational drug taking, any risk-taking behaviour \u2014 that might sound silly, given the risks \u2014 but I always dipped a toe before doing anything,\" Mel says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The crew I partied with, for the most part, were really responsible with it.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Dead before 50: The Australians dying young at the edge of the system\n\nThe popularity of taking GHB recreationally is growing in Australia at the moment. However, the experience varies heavily depending on the dose.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn small amounts, the illicit drug can produce feelings of euphoria, disinhibition and increased libido.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut differences of as little as 0.5ml can lead to overdose, including loss of consciousness, respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing that can stop entirely), muscle twitching and seizures.\n\n\n\n\n\nMixing GHB with alcohol also significantly increases the likelihood of these serious side effects.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Victoria to open Australia's second permanent pill testing site SBS News 04:38 English\n\nAn overdose of GHB is commonly referred to as a 'blow-out', and Mel says she witnessed them frequently during her partying years from around 2011 to 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember partying with it in house settings and then going out and hearing about guys putting it in their beer and sharing the drink, and then people would blow out because they have no idea how much they're having,\" she says.\n\n\n\nI think people party with it really unsafely \u2014 push it, don't track how much they're taking \u2014 and it's just a mess and isn't fun and is dangerous.\n\nWhile she never had a serious overdose experience, Mel says she once had an unsettling experience with GHB at a music festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had been taking it throughout the night moderately and then we went to bed,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went to sleep and woke up like 10 hours later. It was steaming hot; I'd been moved into a different tent [by friends]. The people I was sharing a tent with had napped and left, moved me around and I woke up sweating, under blankets and out cold until like midday.\"\n\n\n\nMel says the experience \"spooked\" her because she could not recall what had happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite now being in her early 30s and a world away from the party scene of her 20s, Mel says she's still open to taking GHB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know how to do it safely and what company you need to keep. I also didn't do it in public settings, really [bar a festival] because I didn't like the lack of comfort or safety if things tipped over a little,\" she says.\n\n\n\nGHB use on the rise\n\nWhile it is still relatively uncommon compared to cocaine and marijuana, the recreational use of GHB \u2014 sometimes known as 'G', 'juice', 'Gina' or 'fantasy' \u2014 is on an upward trend in Australia right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the National Drug Strategy Household survey produced by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows the number of people aged 14 and over who had used GHB in the previous 12 months doubled from 0.1 per cent in 2019 to 0.2 per cent in 2022-23.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australians are using 'ice', cocaine and heroin at record levels\n\nEleanor Costello, evidence manager at the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, says changing trends in illicit drug use are normal and can come down to cultural shifts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They may be more featured in the media and things move out of popularity ... it does go through phases,\" Costello says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current low price of GHB relative to other illicit drugs and its availability may also be driving interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice say they have made significant border seizures of GHB and related substances in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) announced in May it had observed a \"tidal wave\" of imports of the chemical solvent 1,4-Butanediol and seized more than 3.8 tonnes in the first four months of this year.\n\n\n\nKnown as 'bute', the solvent has industrial applications but was listed as a border-controlled drug last year as it converts to GHB in the body almost immediately once ingested.\n\n\n\n\n\nAFP acting assistant commissioner Paula Hudson said in a statement at the time that by importing the substance into Australia, \"criminal networks are creating a demand and appetite for this illicit drug\".\n\n\n\nThe bigger the appetite, the bigger the profits.\n\nYoung women and GHB\n\nThere is also evidence GHB is starting to gain popularity among groups that have not traditionally used it much before.\n\n\n\n\n\nGHB use has been relatively common among the LGBTIQ+ community for a long time \u2014 nearly 20 per cent of gay and bisexual men report having used it at least once in their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent research has found that a growing number of young women are ending up in hospitals in Australia after using GHB.\n\n\n\nKrista Siefried, the clinical research lead at the National Centre for Clinical Research on Emerging Drugs, says she became interested in studying trends in the drug after seeing more young women presenting with GHB withdrawal symptoms firsthand while working at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers can develop dependence on GHB easily and Siefried says when people try to stop, there can be severe reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What you can see is that it can be quite complicated by things like seizures or delirium. So, we really recommend that people do seek medical advice when they're trying to either cut back or stop their GHB use,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiefried led research that looked at more than 9,600 emergency department visits due to GHB overdose across 88 hospitals from 2015 to 2024.\n\n\n\nGHB has long been associated with criminal behaviour, including drink spiking, sexual assault, rape and theft. Credit: Henglein and Steets/Getty Images The number of visits for GHB rose from 24.9 per 100,000 emergency department visits in 2015-16 to 101 per 100,000 from July 2023 to January 2024 \u2014 a threefold increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research also found young women aged 16 to 24 accounted for more hospitalisations over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015-17, women accounted for around 30 per cent of hospitalisations, and by 2023-24, that figure had increased to around 40 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Traditionally, GHB was known to be used amongst party-going men who have sex with men, particularly, and so that was kind of the area that was most predominantly researched,\" Siefried says.\n\n\n\n\"We started to see that GHB use is sort of proliferating to other areas and so what we wanted to do was sort of explore who else is using,\" Siefried says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the report was not able to infer whether those hospitalisations were due to voluntary or involuntary GHB ingestion, Siefried says other smaller studies have found young women self-reporting more GHB use in recent years.\n\n\n\nDrink spiking\n\nGHB has long been associated with criminal behaviour, including drink spiking, sexual assault, rape and theft.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AFP has referred to it as an \"instrument of crime\", and research literature on young women and GHB has largely focused on its use as a 'date rape' drug.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Australians are testing illicit drugs before taking them says study SBS News 01:20 English\n\nHowever, Costello says the use of GHB in drink spiking is actually uncommon compared to spiking with alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a perception that [GHB] is used, but in many cases it's actually not,\" she says.\n\n\n\nI mean, other depressant drugs may be used as well, but most often the main one that we do see presented is alcohol.\n\nSiefried says it's important to maintain \"perspective\" about GHB and spiking, given alcohol is \"far more likely to be associated with sexual violence, arguably, than any other drug\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, research notes that determining whether GHB has been used in a drink spiking case can be difficult as it has a short 'half-life', which is the time it takes for the amount of a drug's active substance in the body to reduce by half.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this, GHB becomes undetectable through a urine test after around 12 hours, before some victims will have made it to an emergency department or reported to police.\n\n\n\nHarm reduction\n\nFor those using GHB recreationally, Siefried stresses a need for broader education around the drug as it becomes more popular.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile overdoses caused by opioids can be treated quickly with naloxone (opioid antagonist), there is no such drug that can reverse the effects of GHB and deaths associated with the drug have risen markedly in recent years.\n\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, 51 GHB-related deaths were recorded in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023 \u2014 a period half as long \u2014 there were 166 deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiefried recommends that anybody who chooses to use the drug should \"go low and go slow\" by taking a small dose, avoiding repeating doses and ensuring use with somebody who is not taking GHB.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a person's breathing becomes shallow, they start to show signs of blue lips or they are vomiting and not waking up, it's necessary to call an ambulance for their safety, she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we need to take from this is that we need to make sure that people who are new to GHB and communities that are new to GHB use are aware of those harm reduction strategies to make sure they can use GHB safely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders struggling with their use of alcohol and other substances can contact the National Alcohol and Other Drug Hotline on 1800 250 015 for free and confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

        "text": "By the time a woman is in her 50s, she is more than $50,000 behind men the same age, according to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new data, from more than 5.1 million working Australians, shows that while men and women roughly earn the same in their teens and early 20s, the gender pay gap hits its stride when a woman is in her 30s. At this age, a woman earns $15,276 less than a man the same age.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure peaks between ages 55-59, where the pay gap is $52,992.\n\n\n\n\n\nWGEA, which publishes annual gender pay gap reports , only started collecting age information alongside pay data last year, meaning these latest figures show for the first time the full extent to which the gender pay gap grows throughout a woman's career.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News WGEA CEO Mary Wooldridge said the findings show that steps need to be taken early to make sure women get a fair go in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Interventions at critical times could reduce the gender pay gap and improve women's ability to earn and save for retirement,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a release accompanying the report, the WGEA said: \"To consider the cumulative financial impact, adding the earnings difference for every age from 15-67, women earn, on average, about $1.5 million less than men.\"\n\n\n\nWhy are women paid less as they age?\n\nThere are a few ways this happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, as women age, they are more likely to work part-time. The number of women in full-time employment sits at around 50 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor men, the percentage in full-time employment is anywhere from 60 to 80 per cent, depending on age.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, a reliable way to earn a higher salary is to move into a management role. However, the data found that by age 34, managers are more likely to be men.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The Australian employers reducing their gender pay gap \u2014 and those falling short\n\nWomen who do become managers still earn less, with women managers between 55 and 50 earning an average of $85,662 less than male managers of the same age.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of profession could be another factor. The gender pay gap is smallest for workers under 20, who tend to be working in retail or food services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter age 20, more women are employed in lower-paid sectors such as healthcare, social services, and education, and these professions stay dominant until retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese sectors have seen recent wage growth , with childcare workers now earning $2800 more on average per year, but not enough to close the gap.\n\n\n\nHow can we fix it?\n\nWooldridge called on employers to take early action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're asking employers to change the story and shape the future,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWGEA CEO Mary Wooldridge says that fixing the gender pay gap benefits both men and women in the workplace. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Actions like offering equal parental leave to women and men can help lift the burden of unpaid care work that women experience as they age.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoolridge also said employers should be open to making more manager roles part-time, or job share. This would require shifting attitudes around part-time workers being perceived as less productive or committed to their jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, WGEA said fixing this gap will make workplaces better for both men and women by offering more flexibility and fair access to leave for everyone.\n\n\n\n",

And whenever there's work going on within the city walls, you can guarantee that they're going to unearth some things. I think ghosts kind of sprung up from that sort of idea that as soon as some work goes on, we're going to find some new Roman remains or something.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHalloween, which means All Hallows Eve, marks All Souls Day in Christian calendars - a night when the souls of the dead return to their former homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day's origins go back before the arrival of Christianity in the British Isles to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the transition to winter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn York, many locals claim their city is the most haunted city in Europe - but of course that's a claim that can't be measured.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it certainly has a strong tradition of ghostly hauntings and spooky sightings.\n\n\n\n\n\nDown the Shambles, York's famous medieval street, there are lots of shops selling wands, potions, brooms and, of course, ghosts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most popular shop is the York Ghost Merchants, with queues stretching down the narrow lane, run by the same Mr Kelly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The York Ghost Merchants was born about York having an incredible history of storytelling, hauntings, ghosts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInside this curious old building are handmade ghosts - the recipe is a secret but the ghosts are tough like stone and each one is handmade in the city and no two are ever exactly alike.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of theatre in the store, with secret merchandise hidden behind spooky portraits and all of the staff wear Victorian-era outfits.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if those cute little ghosts aren't sweet enough for you then how about a chocolate replica from Bettys Tea Rooms, an institution in York that has been serving tea and cakes in the city since 1937.\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch manager Carol Hanson says this Halloween Bettys have created their own chocolate ghosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they add the white chocolate, and spin around the moulds and then add the milk, every little ghost is different... They're all handmade, all hand decorated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBettys in York even has its own ghost story.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a legend that the ghost of Bettys' founder, Frederick Belmont, a Swiss emigrant who established the first Bettys tea room in 1919, walks the corridors of the branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, hidden around town are spectral sculptures of ghostly hauntings.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome eerie wire frame installations appear around York where you least expect them, representing ghostly images from York's history with monks in the graveyard, nuns in the museum garden, even a bear.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story goes that a bear escaped from York museum and chased the curator around the garden - though both survived the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Alsop is the operations manager for the York BID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can see behind me a Victorian penny farthing rider. He's one of our new ghosts for 2025, making it a total of 60 ghosts in total as part of the York BIDs Ghosts in the Gardens project.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get into the Halloween spirit is to take a ghost walk.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 44 years, Mark Graham has been treading the streets of York telling spooky tales and scaring visitors on his ghost walk.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, Mark has acquired a number of terrifying tales to chill the spines of his clients.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it seems there isn't a street in town without a haunting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was in there in 1953 that my friend was working. He was up a ladder, working on a pipe - he was a plumber - but from out of the wall in front of him stepped a Roman soldier. He screamed, fell off his ladder, scampered into a corner and watched as at least 20 Roman soldiers walked through this wall. One of them laid on a horse, fast asleep. You could see them in fine detail: round shields, swords, spears. You can only see them though from the knees upwards. You couldn't see the lower leg, the foot.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "During busy times of the day, council rubbish trucks experience congestion at the Ravenhall tipping face, which jeopardises their ability to complete bin pick-up cycles across the city, Cleanaway argues. The company says the cap also gives the tip\u2019s operators less time to compact piles of waste, which means the landfill is filling up more quickly. \u201cThe landfill cells have a shorter lifespan than planned,\u201d the company said in its latest proposal, adding that the density of waste in each landfill cell has reduced by 12 per cent since 2019 because machine operators are getting less time to compact it. The expanded tipping face would only be used at times of high demand, when there is a logjam of council waste trucks, the company argues. It claims the expansion will bring environmental benefits because the landfill will be able to accept more rubbish and trucks will not have to idle for long periods. The EPA has twice refused to give Cleanaway\u2019s proposed two-year pilot project a green light. An EPA assessment submitted to VCAT as part of the hearing details the environmental watchdog\u2019s opposition to Cleanaway\u2019s proposal, including its rejection of the company\u2019s claim that a two-year tipping face expansion could credibly be called a trial.\n\n\u201cThe concept proposed by the applicant does not seek to engage in a genuine activity of research, demonstration or development as it is not seeking to assess a new concept,\u201d the EPA says in its statement of claims. Instead, Cleanaway hopes to expand its tip operation \u201cwithout providing any system to determine an optimum tipping face size that adequately mitigates against environmental risks\u201d. The EPA argues that there are \u201cfour tangible risks to human health and the environment\u201d if Cleanaway expands its operation: more litter; more vermin and disease vectors; more risk of landfill fires; and increased odour. First in the line of impact from an expanded landfill operation would be inmates of the Dame Phyllis Frost remand centre, just 200 metres away. The EPA argues inmates\u2019 human rights could be breached due to impacts from odour, litter and vermin.\n\n\u201cThe neighbouring correctional facility may be impacted due to close proximity and the inability for inmates to be removed from the facility if impacted by odour. Vermin fouling roofs may also compromise security monitoring equipment,\u201d it said. The EPA also argues the bigger tipping face would cause a spike in the local seagull population. The Ravenhall tip is already home to thousands of silver gulls, and the EPA says a surge in their numbers would damage nearby property and threaten the survival of other bird species. \u201cEPA considers the trial will increase the quantity of exposed waste on site due to the larger tipping faces which will increase the availability of food for vermin, in turn attracting more vermin to the site.\u201d Site inspections by EPA officers suggest the company already struggles to control litter escaping from the landfill or to manage the seagull population, the authority said.\n\nCleanaway breached its tipping face cap 24 times between June 2021 and April 2025, according to EPA records. The EPA\u2019s stance drew fire from Peter Anderson, chief executive of industry group the Victorian Waste Management Alliance, who accused it of being obstructionist, instead of helping Cleanaway solve the problem. Anderson said Melbourne was running low on landfill capacity and Cleanaway was trying to find answers. \u201cMelbourne is getting bigger, and it\u2019s producing more waste, and we are getting less holes in the ground. Why doesn\u2019t the EPA work with Cleanaway for a better solution, rather than just building walls?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the community in the end that will suffer because they won\u2019t be able to get rid of their rubbish, or it\u2019s going to cost more and more to move it somewhere else.\u201d Melton Mayor Steve Abboushi said residents in nearby Mt Atkinson had already complained to the council about landfill odour. \u201cThe community is deeply concerned about what this application means in terms of the environmental effects, especially given this tip is very close to a number of our housing estates,\u201d Abboushi said. \u201cWe hold concerns about what this means in real terms for our residents.\u201d Loading",

The Ashes has arrived and the top-order will consist of a 38-year-old converted first-drop and \u2026 and who?\n\nEqually, letting Warner go on and on when Australia could have been cultivating new top-order batsmen might have been the selectorial chicken that was always going to come home to roost in the 2025-26 Ashes.\n\nMaybe David Warner was right, and the Australian selectors really did have to put up with the mediocrity of his declining years because there was no-one better.\n\nIn the 15 Test matches since Warner took his chosen bow, Usman Khawaja has changed partners like a square dancer: six swapsies. He took four turns around the floor with Steve Smith (average partnership 21.75), three with Nathan McSweeney (19.8), two with Sam Konstas (39.25), two with Travis Head (54, when Head was a horse for a Sri Lankan course), one with Marnus Labuschagne (20) and finally back with Konstas for another three (18.3). During that time, Australia has lost its first wicket, on average, with 26 runs on the board.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the average opening stand in Warner\u2019s last 15 Test matches was 34.2. There were days when Australia being none for 100 at lunch on the first day of an Ashes series felt a bit boring. This summer, only optimists are forecasting one for 34 by drinks.\n\nCredit: Simon Letch\n\nThe names of Khawaja\u2019s dance partners, post-Warner, say as much as their figures. Smith, McSweeney, Head and Labuschagne were all playing out of position (as was Khawaja when he returned to the Test team four years ago). Only Konstas was an opener, though he did everything possible not to look like one. He was lumped with the unrealistic expectations of Australian magical thinking. If Bradman, Ponting, Walters and Steve Waugh were good enough for Test cricket when barely drinking age \u2026 yup.\n\nSince they started watching the Sheffield Shield again around 2024, the selectors must have been wondering what kind of game this was and where all the openers had gone. They awarded Marcus Harris a central contract just before his batting position, and his stats, dropped down the Victorian order. Jake Weatherald has been consistent, but his career average is, like his age, in the 30s. At his big audition this week he made a third-ball duck and 12. The urgers keep saying Konstas is one innings away when he looks more like he\u2019s three years away. Henry Hunt, Campbell Kellaway, McSweeney \u2013 one of them is looking great one week, out cheaply to a Jackson Bird or a Matthew Kelly the next.",

        "text": "The Nationals have voted to scrap net zero from their policy platform, with federal MPs expected to do the same on Sunday ahead of wider Coalition talks on energy policy.\n\nThe motion to \u201cabandon support for a net zero mandate\u201d was passed at the party\u2019s Federal Council meeting in Canberra on Saturday.\n\nIts passing does not bind the party\u2019s federal MPs to do the same, however the outcome is expected to be similar when the group meets on Sunday morning.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSaturday\u2019s motion does not vanquish all support for emissions reductions, with the party voting to support a \u201cflexible policy framework that caters for emissions reductions, while growing and protecting key industries\u201d.\n\nAhead of the vote, Nationals leader David Littleproud told members the resolution was \u201ceminently sensible\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday you\u2019ll debate a resolution, an eminently sensible resolution, around making sure we have a commonsense solution to our energy, to our climate. We believe in maintaining and protecting our climate and our environment. There are practical ways,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not walking away from reducing emissions, but we can do it a better, fairer, cheaper way. We can align ourselves with the world as the world pivots from an arbitrary target to using common sense, making sure that they don\u2019t destroy their economies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe can do that, calm and considered, and we work with our coalition partners.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve made it clear with Sussan Ley that while we respect the sovereignty of their room, we\u2019ve asked her to respect the sovereignty of our room. And we\u2019ve come together in a considered way to work together. And that is the endeavour that we will start tomorrow morning at 9am.\u201d\n\nNet Zero has been a growing sore point within the broader Coalition, as well as within the two parties.\n\nSince becoming opposition leader, Ms Ley has refused to take a concrete stance on whether Australia should strive to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInstead, she has committed to a blanket policy review, arguing it is needed after the Coalition\u2019s decimation at the federal election in May.\n\nWhile some moderates within the Liberal Party are reportedly happy to keep a watered-down version of the policy, many high profile MPs, including now-backbencher Andrew Hastie, have taken a public stance in firm opposition.\n\nBarnaby Joyce flagged the Nationals\u2019 support of Net Zero as a major reason behind his decision to take a break from the party room.\n\n\u201cOur position in continuing to support net zero with the massive schism and hurt to my electorate, to small businesses, to the environment, to the poor, to the defence of Australia and creating hate between lifelong friends in my community makes continuing in the Nationals\u2019 Party Room in Canberra under this policy untenable,\u201d he said last month.\n\nMore to come",

        "text": "Caravanning is becoming increasingly popular as Aussies hit the open road and document their seemingly glamorous holidays travelling around our vast country. Images of spectacular landscapes and exciting wildlife encounters flood social media, leaving many to wonder if they should also jump on the caravanning bandwagon.\n\nBut if you needed a little shade from the light shining on caravanning holidays right now, this video might provide a reality check.\n\nA truckie from Grafton in northern NSW captured the moment his wife Korrine was dumping the family's caravan toilet, lovingly referred to as the 'devil's suitcase', into a campground dump point, and the experience was so horrendous, she was left \"dry heaving\" by the side of the road.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"I was towing the caravan out and my wife said we'd better call in and empty the toilet on the way out,\" Brenton Smith told Yahoo News. \"She jumped out, and that's when I could see her heaving... The smell from the pit got her, and I think some splashed up on her hand. Me and the two kids were just in the car laughing.\n\n\"She's got a bit of a weak stomach at the best of times... It can't be that bad.\"\n\nNotably, Brenton admitted he hasn't yet done the toilet emptying task.\n\nHave you had a gross experience emptying your caravan toilet? Contact sophie.coghill@yahooinc.com\n\nTruckie claims dumping the caravan toilet is 'as bad as it gets'\n\nBrenton and his family, who travelled over 260 kilometres on their maiden journey in their new caravan, were excited about the prospect of exploring more of Australia. Despite it being his first caravan journey with his family, Brenton has been \"camping all his life\" and said the dumping of the caravan toilet is \"as bad as it gets\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Being able to just have a shower and everything in our own little house on wheels, it's awesome,\" he said. \"I'd say the toilet dumping is the worst of it. It's usually very comfortable.\"\n\nKorrine isn't the first to be filmed tackling the horrendous task, with Sydney woman Brooke Goosen caught on camera dumping her family's toilet into a designated dump site last year. She told Yahoo News, \"it was foul\" and found the whole system \"outdated\".\n\n\"If we're getting rockets into space, surely there's a better way,\" she said.\n\nCampers frequently say how horrendous it is to dump the waste from their caravan. Source: Instagram/goosens_are_trippin & Moysoutdoors\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAshley Moy, a dad who was staying in Alice Springs with his family in June, had to go one step further and put his hand down the dumping site after the cap of his caravan toilet fell in along with the waste. A video captured him armed with a pair of tongs standing by the dump site as he tightly wound up his sleeves and plunged his arm down to retrieve the cap.\n\nHe told Yahoo News it was too \"important\" to leave behind. He managed to grab it, but was left gagging from his efforts.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
