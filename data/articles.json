        "text": "E\ufefflon Musk has confirmed the end of his tenure in the Trump White House after a turbulent effort to slash government jobs and spending.\n\nThe richest man in the world headed up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from the start of the second Trump administration, vowing to cut $1 trillion in public spending.\n\nHowever, critics said his efforts to do so only hampered the role of government and left crucial departments dangerously under-resourced, while Musk also reportedly clashed with other administration members.\n\n\ufeff Recently, Musk said he would be reducing his political spending and stepping back from the role, as the value and brand of his company Tesla plummeted around the world and in the US.\n\nMusk took to his social media site, X, to say his \"scheduled time\" as a special government employee had come to an end.\n\nHe said DOGE would stay active despite his departure.\ufeff\n\nAlthough it's been claimed as a pre-planned departure, the change comes \ufeffafter Musk, initially an extremely prominent figure in Trump's return to the Oval Office, became increasingly sidelined, and parted company with the president on a number of economic issues.\n\nElon Musk with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. (AP)\n\nMost recently, he criticised the legislation dubbed by Trump as \"the big, beautiful bill\" , which critics claim will increase the burden on poorer and working-class Americans, while giving tax cuts to the rich.\n\nMusk said he was \"disappointed\" in the bill and that it was a case of major over-spending that would undermine the work of DOGE.\ufeff\n\nThe multi-billionaire has also not been fully onboard with Trump's wide-ranging tariff impositions in recent months\ufeff, calling presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks\".\n\nUS House Speaker Mike Johnson thanked Musk for his work in the administration and pledged that the Republican-majority Congress would continue to cut spending based on DOGE's findings.\n\nREAD MORE: The top ten richest people in Australia\n\nMusk during a Trump campaign rally in October 2024. (AP)\n\nMusk in the White House\n\nIf this truly is a scheduled departure, with Musk quietly departing as was planned all along after 130 days, it could be considered a triumph.\n\nTrump's first presidential term was notorious for rapid-swing hirings and firings by presidential edict, most famously in Anthony Scaramucci's bombastic 11-day tenure as White House Communications Director. \ufeff\n\nBut so far, Trump's second presidential term has been marked by a greater tendency to pick-and-stick, even in the face of mounting establishment criticism of figures such as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.\ufeff\n\nMusk wields a chainsaw onstage, celebrating the slashing of thousands of government jobs. (Nine)\n\nMusk was omnipresent during Trump's time as president-elect, reportedly staying with him at Mar-a-Lago\ufeff and even joining phone calls with world leaders.\n\nHe was also often at Trump's side when the Republican returned to the White House post-inauguration, with the president even partaking in a display of Musk's Tesla cars on the White House lawn.\n\nTrump's endorsement of DOGE, which despite the acronym was not a government department nor seemingly accountable to any process, kept Musk prominent as he set about slashing government jobs and programs.\n\nAs well as rapidly becoming unpopular around the US, many of Musk's cuts triggered legal fightbacks that remain entangled in the courts.\ufeff\n\nCelebrity Trump supporters now turning on the US president View Gallery\n\nMusk, who until recent years was publicly Democrat-leaning, came on board Trump's 2024 presidential campaign with a US$250 million ($389 million) donation\ufeff and a major social media force in the form of his online platform X.\n\nIt guaranteed him a place in the sun, but in recent months and weeks he has dropped further into the periphery of the administration, particularly as the Trump administration's focus became international in the form of trade wars, and actual wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nMusk's own plummeting popularity had also been considered a factor in the rapidly falling value of his electric car company Tesla, and he recently indicated he would cut back on political spending, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\n\nHe also admitted to the Washington Post that he had fallen short of his goal of slashing US$1 trillion from the federal budget.\n\n\"The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.\"\ufeff\ufeff",

        "text": "A US federal trade court has blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law.\n\nThe ruling from a three-judge panel on Wednesday (Thursday AEST) came after several lawsuits arguing Trump has exceeded his authority, left US trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos.\n\nAt least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centrepiece of Trump's trade policy.\n\nWho will pay the price for Donald Trump's escalating trade war? (Nine)\n\nTariffs must typically be approved by Congress, but Trump says he has the power to act because the country's trade deficits amount to a national emergency.\n\n\"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\" the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorise the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\".\n\nThe US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world, including Australia, in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits.\n\nHe earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the US border.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump administration orders some US software companies to halt sales to China\n\nChina was hit with some of the toughest US tariffs. (AP)\n\nHis administration argues that courts approved then-president Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \"political\" question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.\n\nTrump's Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for US economic growth.\n\nSo far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive.\n\nA dozen US states also filed suit, led by Oregon.\n\n\"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,\" Attorney-General Dan Rayfield said.\n\nPresident lashes reports of 'TACO acronym' used among traders\n\n\ufeffThere's a new type of trade taking hold on Wall Street: TACO, short for Trump Always Chickens Out.\n\nIn other words, don't fret too much about Trump's latest tariff threat and go on a selling spree, because eventually he'll back down and a relief rally will ensue.\n\nTrump said he first learned of the term, coined by Financial Times commentator Robert Armstrong, on Wednesday when a reporter sought his reaction to it.\n\n\"I chicken out? Oh, I've never heard that. You mean because I reduced China from 145 per cent that I set down to 100 and then to another number?\" Trump said, referring to tariff rates he imposed on imported Chinese goods.\n\nREAD MORE: China mission lifts off to two unusual space objects never observed before\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May20, 2025, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\n\ufeff\"You call that chickening out?\" Trump responded to a reporter at an Oval Office event overnight, referring to his recent announcements on EU and Chinese tariff rates.\n\n\"It's called negotiation,\" Trump added, saying that part of his tactic can include setting \"a ridiculous high number\" for tariff rates and going down if he gets other nations to give in to his demands.",

(Ohio BCI's Criminal Intelligence Unit)\n\nShe'd been wrapped in cloth, a rose placed carefully on her chest.\n\nSince then, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office has been working to discover her identity.\n\nMonths after she was found, a sketch was released depicting what Goodwin may have looked like; one year later, in 2019, a clay sculpture of her suspected likeness was also unveiled.\n\nHer fingerprints were taken, her DNA was uploaded and run through CODIS with no results.\n\nThen, in 2023, the coroner's office held a press conference to release digital 3D images created by BCI.\n\nThe woman was wearing grey, silky pyjama bottoms and a grey tank top.\n\nA name, possibly \"Schrader,\" was written in permanent marker on the tag inside the pyjama bottoms.\n\nA white metal hair stylist-type hair clip was in her hair.\n\nShe was wearing silver hoop earrings and three hair ties on her wrist.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Sammarco pointed out that earrings Goodwin is wearing in a BMV photo taken for her driver's licence match the earrings found on the woman in Avondale.\n\nOver four separate press conferences in the last seven years, Hamilton County Coroner Lakshmi Sammarco has said her office did not suspect Goodwin was a victim of foul play.\n\nGoodwin's autopsy had revealed she'd had drugs in her system and her cause of death is believed to be an overdose.\n\nThat's the same cause of death determined for Goodwin's son, whose body arrived at the Hamilton County Coroner's Office one year after Goodwin was discovered.\n\nElena Iatarola, special agent in charge for FBI Cincinnati, said the department's Investigative Genetic Genealogy team were able to use Goodwin's DNA to tie her more closely to family trees already in the FBI's database.\n\nThat led to Goodwin's family.\n\nThrough that connection, officials discovered Goodwin's son had died from an overdose in 2019.\n\nDNA testing performed on the Jane Doe discovered in 2018 and Goodwin's son's body showed that it was 99.99 per cent likely the Jane Doe was his mother, Patricia Goodwin.\n\nSammarco said some of the other details of the case have been cleared up in speaking with Goodwin's family, and others who knew her son.\n\n\"It's likely that they were together and that he tried to bury his mother the best that he could and left a rose on her chest,\" said Sammarco.\n\n\"That's what we think might have happened, but it's sort of a guess at this point.\"\n\nAt least one person who knew Goodwin's son said that he'd mentioned being with his mother, but that she'd died a year prior.\n\nSammarco said unfortunately, Goodwin's brother died a year ago, without ever learning what happened to his sister.\n\nHe'd never stopped looking for her, Sammarco said.\n\nStill, she said now the rest of Goodwin's family knows.\n\n\"This kind of closure, it's one of the things we do in this office is try and bring that peace and closure to these families,\" Sammarco said.\n\nJennifer Lester, a criminal intelligence analyst with BCI who's worked on Goodwin's case since 2018 had a message for families who may be missing a loved one.\n\nEven if your loved one has been reported missing to a local law enforcement agency, you can still call 855.BCI.OHIO to report them missing with BCI.",

And earlier this year, rhode announced that its products will be seen in-stores at Sephoras in North America and the United Kingdom.\n\nHailey Bieber attends the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California, on March 12.

(Lionel Hahn/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\nBieber will serve as rhode's chief creative officer and head of innovation, the company said. She's the company's founder and current creative director.\n\nWith a strong social media presence, in addition to Bieber's own digital footprint both before and after her marriage to singer Justin Bieber, rhode \"has a powerful engagement model,\" e.l.f. said in its earnings call just after the announcement Wednesday. Fans will often wait hours in line for rhode pop-ups, and its products are frequently sold out on its website.\n\n\"One of the things we really like about rhode is just how tight the product assortment is. It's only 10 products across skincare, colour cosmetics and accessories,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in the same earnings call.\n\nE.l.f., meanwhile, dominates the skincare and makeup market for young consumers and is teens' top cosmetic brand, according to a survey from investment firm Piper Sandler . The company said it could help rhode expand into retail and increase its global footprint.\n\nThe massive acquisition comes as e.l.f. is at a crossroads with President Donald Trump's chaotic tariff war with China. As of mid-May, about 75 percent of its global production came from China and is now subject to tariffs of 55 percent, including the tariffs put in place in 2019, the company said in its Wednesday earnings.\n\nIn response to the tariffs, e.l.f. is increasing prices by $1 across its entire portfolio on August 1 . The majority of its products are priced under US$10.\n\nE.l.f. also did not issue guidance for this fiscal year because of uncertainty around tariffs.\n\nBut it is still sticking by its production model.\n\n\"We believe our unique China-based supply chain is an area of competitive advantage we've been honing for the past 21 years\u2026 (We) are committed to our China team and suppliers,\" the company said in its Wednesday earnings call.",

(Supplied: Lucy Phillips)\n\n\"The doctors were stunned,\" Phillips said, adding that it was terrifying to think her son had been \"a walking time bomb\".\n\n\"They couldn't believe how big it was \u2014 or how he was still out there riding bikes, doing tricks at the skate park, breaking bones, getting concussions.\"\n\nIt was only later that tests showed Theo had no right-hand peripheral vision, which may well have contributed to his accidents in the past, his mother said.\n\nDoctors believe Theo may have had the rare and benign tumour - called a papilloma choroid plexus - since birth and it slowly grew over his lifetime.\n\nScans of Theo Phillip's brain revealed the enormous tumour, 10cm in circumference. (Supplied: Lucy Phillips)\n\nTheo was taken by ambulance to Perth Children's Hospital, where specialists began preparing for what would become two major brain surgeries \u2014 one to remove the massive tumour, and another, just days later, to relieve dangerous pressure caused by bleeding on the brain.\n\nThe first operation \u2014 a complex eight-hour procedure \u2014 took place less than two weeks after the discovery. Surgeons warned Theo's parents about the risks: paralysis, stroke, impaired speech, or worse.\n\n\"They told us if they went even a millimetre the wrong way, he might not make it, or he could be paralysed or lose the ability to speak,\" Phillips said.\n\nTheo underwent the marathon brain operation, but, in the hours and days following surgery, it became clear something wasn't right.\n\nTheo's family had no idea the seemingly happy and active 13-year-old had a growing tumour in his brain. (Supplied: Lucy Phillips)\n\n\"He didn't open up his eyes and didn't know the names of people he knew, like his brother,\" Phillips said.\n\nSeven days after the operation, a CT scan revealed a build-up of blood on his brain, and Theo was taken back into surgery \u2014 this time for another seven-hour procedure.\n\n\"This time he was feeling much better and came around a lot quicker from the first op,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"He's starting to remember things and trying to put sentences together now.\"\n\nThat second operation was a fortnight ago. Within a week, Theo's energy had returned \u2014 briefly.\n\n\"He was up and trying to play basketball at the hospital,\" Phillips said. \"And then after that, he said, 'Oh, I feel really dizzy.'\"\n\nWhile Theo was up eating and drinking, and still recovering slowly, his progress had been set back by an infection, she said.\n\nThankfully, Theo was able to come home from the hospital on Tuesday, but her son now faces a\ufeff long and uncertain recovery with a lot of rehabilitation, Phillips said.\n\nThe teenager is still in pain and having trouble finding words and forming sentences.\n\nHowever, Phillips said she and her husband were overwhelmed by their son's strength.\n\n\"He's still got a long way to go, but we're just so incredibly proud of him,\" she said.\n\n\"He's been unbelievably brave through all of this.\"",

        "text": "A US trade court has blocked President Donald Trump from using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports.\n\nThe ruling on Wednesday, local time, by a three-judge panel at the New York-based Court of International Trade followed several lawsuits arguing that the president exceeded his authority, left US trade policy subject to his whims, and unleashed economic chaos.\n\n\"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\" the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Stephen Miller, posted the news on social media, writing \"the judicial coup is out of control\".\n\nIn a statement, the White House said it is \"not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency\".\n\nLoading...\n\nThe ruling faces certain appeal \u2014 and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer \u2014 but it casts a sharp blow on Mr Trump's policy.\n\nAt least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centrepiece of Mr Trump's trade policy.\n\nTariffs must typically be approved by Congress, but Mr Trump says he has the power to act because the country's trade deficits amount to a national emergency.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorise the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\".\n\nThe US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.\n\nGlobal allies were plunged into uncertainty after Donald Trump announced the tariffs. (Reuters: Francis Mascarenhas)\n\nMr Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits.\n\nHe earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the US border.\n\nHis administration argues that courts approved then-president Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \"political\" question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.\n\nMr Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for US economic growth.\n\nFactories in China rush to fulfil US orders Photo shows A man in white and a man in blue in front of a production line. Manufacturers in China race to fulfil US orders as the reciprocal tariff pause takes effect, but the renewed trade war has already caused some businesses to take drastic measures.\n\nSo far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive.\n\nA dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon.\n\n\"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,\" Attorney-General Dan Rayfield said.\n\nAP",

(Supplied: Golden Whitrod)\n\nGenome mapping revealed their child had hereditary spastic paraplegia type 56 (SPG56), which causes degeneration of the nerve cells of the brain.\n\nChildren typically begin to show symptoms between the ages of one and two, losing the ability to sit, stand, walk or talk.\n\n\"Tallulah was 14 months old, hitting all of the milestones. She went from walking to suddenly crawling again, then not crawling and her little arms couldn't hold her up,\" Ms Whitrod said.\n\nChris Whitrod said they were initially relieved to know what was causing their daughter's decline.\n\n\"We thought finally there's a name, there must be a medicine. If you know what it is, fix her,\" Mr Whitrod said.\n\n\" But then they broke the news that Tallulah was the only person in Australia with this disease \u2014 and the only thing you can do is go home and love her. \"\n\nTallulah loved meeting Medea (left) and Mario (right) Voinea, who also have SPG56. (Supplied: Mile Productions)\n\n'Soul families' unite\n\nAfter learning there was no cure, the Whitrod family decided to do whatever it took to find one.\n\nThey moved from the Northern Territory to be closer to research labs, sold their dream home, set up the foundation Our Moon's Mission and hired a team of scientists.\n\nThere are only about 30 known cases of SPG56 worldwide, but through their fundraising efforts the Queenslanders have connected with families from across the globe, including Romania, Moldova, T\u00fcrkiye and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Whitrod family, pictured with the Voinea family from Romania. (Supplied)\n\n\"We're a little soul family of SPG56 kids. The genetic mutations are different and therefore affect the child in different ways,\" Ms Whitrod said.\n\nThe Australians have had access to a range of therapies through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which have drastically improved Tallulah's condition, but that hasn't been the case for their overseas counterparts.\n\n\"So some of the little cherubs are doing OK and others are really struggling,\" Ms Whitrod said.\n\n\" It's bittersweet but I think knowledge is power and just finding that connection builds strength and resilience in our little community. \"\n\nScientists show the Whitrod and Voinea families the work they are doing to find a treatment. (Supplied: Mile Productions)\n\nA bond like no other\n\nThe Voinea family from Romania recently travelled to meet the Whitrods and see the research they've helped fund at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) in Brisbane.\n\nAfter Vlad and Madalina Voinea's first child David battled leukaemia, they discovered their second child Mario and third child Medea had SPG56 in quick succession.\n\n\"We were devastated \u2014 we cried a lot and did not understand why all three children got sick,\" Mr Voinea said.\n\n\" For a long time we felt like monsters \"\n\nChris and Golden Whitrod with Vlad and Madalina Voinea in Brisbane. (Supplied: Mile Productions)\n\nLike the Whitrods, the Voinea family has worked tirelessly, raising more than $2 million in donations.\n\n\"Tallulah is Maria and Medea's sick sister. I say sister because their bond runs deeper than blood,\" Mr Voinea said.\n\n\" It's a rare, deep and painful bond of children united by the same struggle. \"\n\nScientists at the AIBN are developing a state-of-the-art gene therapy that could halt or even reverse the progress of the disease.\n\n\"This isn't just a medical victory \u2014 it's proof that when love is joined with hope, the impossible becomes possible,\" Mr Voinea said.\n\nGolden Whitrod says Tallulah was \"fascinated\" by her meet-up with the Voinea children.\n\n'Hearts the size of Australia'\n\nTallulah quickly won the hearts of the team at the AIBN, led by Ernst Wolvetang.\n\n\"She's an amazing little girl with a lot of courage and positive energy, and that's true for the whole family,\" Professor Wolvetang said.\n\nResearchers culture living brain tissue Photo shows University of Queensland scientist Ernst Wolvetang with a scientist looking at a petrie dish. About a third of people with epilepsy never achieve effective seizure control, but University of Queensland researchers hope they can soon end the trial and error of treatment.\n\n\"They've got hearts the size of Australia. They are doing this not just for their daughter but for all these other kids and we are energised by it as a research team.\"\n\nThe team is using human stem cells to recreate the brain in a dish so they can test different gene therapies.\n\n\"The idea is to make stem cell models from the actual patients that are going to be receiving the therapy to see if it is safe and effective to apply,\" Professor Wolvetang said.\n\n\"This type of disease is not usually on the radar of the big pharmaceutical companies because there are just not enough patients to actually make money.\"\n\nBut he said the AIBN team was creating a \"replica framework\" that could help treat other brain and genetic diseases.\n\nThey hope to begin a clinical trial by the end of the year, and are in the process of finding a suitable site.\n\nTallulah Moon joined her big brother Finn at school this year. (Supplied: Our Moon's Mission)\n\nIn the meantime, the Whitrods continue to celebrate each victory in their unique journey, including having their daughter start school this year.\n\n\"In the first week the feedback we got from the teachers was that no, she wasn't having any trouble fitting in, she was more like Taylor Swift \u2014 we had to push the fans away from Tallulah to give her space,\" Ms Whitrod said.\n\n\"We were just so heartened by that.\"",

(ABC News: Lucie Cutting)\n\nSitting surrounded by boxes of hair in her home studio in southern Tasmania, Ms Walker said the only downside was finding strands of hair everywhere.\n\n\"I have hair in my food, I have hair in my washing, I have hair in my hair \u2014 my house is full of hair,\" she said before laughing.\n\nToday, she is working on a topper, a piece made to blend with a client's existing hair.\n\nLooking through a magnifying glass, she skilfully adds a single strand of hair to the lace.\n\nThis topper will take an estimated 98 hours to complete.\n\nDonations of hair help to keep the cost of wigs down. (ABC News: Lucie Cutting)\n\nThe clock starts ticking before Ms Walker even picks up the Swiss lace, as she must first match donated hair to her client's existing or lost hair in density, texture and colour, if maintaining their former look is what they desire.\n\nFor clients who had, or still have, the beginnings of white or grey hair, Ms Walker individually selects grey or white strands from her compendium of hair.\n\nShe said silver and white hair was the most difficult to source because people with those hair types generally wear their hair short or colour it.\n\n'Bunches' of donations sent by mail\n\nMs Walker receives \"bunches of packages\" of donated hair from all over Australia and New Zealand.\n\nRachel Walker recently received a donation of a 37-year-old ponytail.

I was glad to see me come back,\" she said.\n\nHuman hair trade largely unregulated\n\nWhen unable to meet a client's needs through local donations, Ms Walker buys ethically harvested hair, but said she was facing difficulty in accessing ethical hair because of the war in Ukraine, where her supplier was based.\n\nAssa Doron says a certification system for the ethical collection of human hair is needed.

(ABC Hobart: Lucie Cutting)\n\nClaire Prior, the council's Tasmanian director of supportive care, said the wigs could be tailored to suit a client's face.\n\n\"I certainly see the impact that having a new wig fitted makes on people \u2026 I often get to see people walking out with their shoulders up,\" she said.\n\nA woman is fitted with a wig at the Cancer Council of Tasmania. (ABC Hobart: Lucie Cutting)\n\nThe Cancer Council accepts donated wigs, and other organisations, such as Sustainable Salons \u2014 who sort and send hair to wigmakers and charities across Australia \u2014 accept donations of plaited natural or coloured hair ponytails of 20 centimetres or longer.\n\nThe Australia Alopecia Areata Foundation offers wig advice online for children and adults living with alopecia.\n\n\"You don't have to donate to me \u2026 you can donate to any wig-making charity that supports people who have medical hair loss,\" Ms Walker said.\n\n\" It's a way of bringing joy into people's lives when they've lost what they've lost. \"",

There are no more beds available for patients. Patients can't leave [the emergency department],\" Dr Knox said.\n\n\" We can't get patients into the hospital. [It's] termed code black, which is effectively gridlock. \"\n\nDr Knox recently went public with concerns that he and his colleagues had been asked to reduce the clinical urgency of cancer surgeries so the hospital did not breach waiting list targets.\n\nThe Western NSW Local Health District (WNSWLHD) rejected the claims, however NSW Health has ordered a review of the re-categorisation of surgeries at Orange Hospital.\n\nSurgeons have suggested solutions they say will ease waiting list pressures and future-proof the workforce. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)\n\nDr Knox said he now felt compelled to speak up for colleagues in other hospital departments.\n\n\"When messages are going around from fellow surgeons asking if anyone has the option to accommodate a child who's been stuck in ED for over 24 hours with appendicitis [and she] is the same age as your daughter, that's when it starts to become a personal issue,\" he said.\n\nEmergency surgery's 'hidden crisis'\n\nThe Orange Health Service's intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency surgery regularly experience high demand.\n\nThe ABC has seen correspondence from doctors detailing operations which had been postponed due to a shortage of ICU or high dependency beds despite some of their patients' surgeries being overdue.\n\nThe hospital's anaesthetics department wrote to management in September 2024 expressing its alarm about what its doctors were seeing.\n\n\"For a while now, the department of anaesthesia (sic) at OHS [Orange Health Service] has raised concern at a local level that patients requiring emergency surgery are given a lower priority than patients waiting for an elective procedure,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"We suggest that both the hospital and the district [WNSWLHD] need to prioritise the sickest surgical patients in the district rather than meet KPIs for elective surgery.\n\n\" We are making the sickest patients wait longer than they need to. \"\n\nDr Rob Knox says several departments, including intensive care, are under constant pressure. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)\n\nDr Knox said the hospital's management of emergency surgeries prompted his department to make a tough decision.\n\n\"I think emergency surgery is the real hidden crisis,\" he said.\n\n\"We've certainly agreed that if we have an enormous volume of patients waiting, who do not look like they're going to get their emergency surgery operation in time, we are going to cancel patients off our elective lists.\"\n\nIn a statement, a WNSWLHD spokesperson said they \"reject claims that surgeons have been asked to reclassify surgical procedures and prioritise waiting list targets over patient care\".\n\n\"During periods of significant demand for emergency care, resources are directed to people with the most critical needs,\" they said.\n\n\"Decisions to postpone surgery are not taken lightly, and are made with appropriate clinical consultation and consideration.\"\n\nDoctors suggest robotics common in the city\n\nSenior doctors have put forward proposals to hospital management which they say will slash waiting lists, deliver high quality patient care and future-proof the hospital and its workforce.\n\nThey have been campaigning for robotic surgical equipment to be installed.\n\nUrological surgeon Clair Whelan said she had to refer half of her patients to Sydney because she could not see them in the recommended time frame, and many expected to receive robotic surgery which was only available at metropolitan hospitals.\n\nDr Clair Whelan says the future of Orange's urology service hinges on the availability of robotic surgical equipment. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)\n\nTwo urologists are due to start in Orange in 2026, but Dr Whelan said their appointments would be compromised if the equipment was not available.\n\n\"I can say unequivocally that the young urologists, who have trained on robotic surgery, will not be able to work in the Orange area or in the western district because they won't have that facility,\" she said.\n\n\" What we're talking about is the difference between having any urology service at all within the next two years. \"\n\nDr Whelan said Sydney hospitals would then have to care for all of the Central West's surgical patients, including those requiring prostate cancer operations which was the most common cancer in NSW since 2020.\n\n\"It basically means every one of them will be going over to Sydney to see someone,\" she said.\n\n\"That's a massive burden on what is already an overstretched system in Sydney as well.\n\n\"Hospitals are stretched, regardless of where they are. The burden of half the state coming to them is not going to help.\"\n\nCancer surgeries delayed to make hospital look good Photo shows Hospital buildings. A surgeon is speaking out after hospital management re-categorised the urgency of some cancer surgeries from highest to lowest without consulting him.\n\nIn an email to senior doctors, seen by the ABC, WNSWLHD chief executive Mark Spittal said while work was being done on the proposal for robotic surgery at a ministerial level, he did not want to apply pressure.\n\n\"I do not necessarily want to be forced to justify of (sic) why Orange would be the rural pilot site against another rural/regional hospital with a larger catchment such as Wagga, Tweed, Port Macquarie or others etc.\" he wrote.\n\nDr Whelan said a decision was needed soon.\n\n\"We kind of need a plan within the next six months because without that plan the rest of it will topple over, the workforce will topple over,\" she said.\n\nOutsourcing proposal\n\nThe doctors have approached the hospital and WNSWLHD with another proposal to help ease surgery waiting list pressures.\n\nThey want them to consider using vacant operating theatres at a neighbouring private hospital for lower acuity surgeries.\n\nA vacant theatre across the road could be used immediately, while two others would be available once fitted out. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)\n\nRamsay Healthcare leases level four of the Bloomfield Medical Centre for its Ramsay Surgical Centre.\n\nIt has one vacant theatre and two others available once they are fitted out.\n\n\"It's this very frustrating situation when we have a public hospital that's bursting at the seams \u2026 to know that literally across the road are empty operating theatres that could be staffed, funded, used at short notice, that will deal with this,\" Dr Knox said.\n\nSenior doctors want Orange Hospital's management to utilise theatres at a neighbouring private hospital (right). (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)\n\nHe said using private resources would not result in problems experienced at Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney.\n\n\"If it's a question of patient safety I think the obvious safe situation is literally across the road from the main referral hospital of the district,\" Dr Knox said.\n\n\"There's an on-site ICU, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, specialists, anaesthetists, and it's a 10-minute walk or 30-second ambulance trip.\"\n\nIn a statement, Ramsay Surgical Centre chief executive Ben Chiarella said its facility had \"significant capacity and resources available for growth and further utilisation if and when required\".\n\n\"We have a good working relationship with Western NSW LHD's executive team and continue to offer our support in any strategic discussions or collaboration required to improve health access, equity, and outcomes in this region,\" Mr Chiarella said.\n\nOrange Health Service is the hub of medical services in central western NSW. (ABC News)\n\nOn March 27, State Health Minister Ryan Park told the NSW parliament that adverse patient outcomes at Sydney's Northern Beaches Hospital did not preclude other types of arrangements with the private sector.\n\n\"The bill does not and is not intended to prohibit or impact on other arrangements entered into with the private sector,\" Mr Park told parliament.\n\n\"[The private sector] can also be contracted to provide specific clinical services to public patients, such as [instances like] private health facilities providing elective surgery to public patients to reduce waiting lists after the COVID\u201119 pandemic.\n\n\"Such arrangements can be beneficial to NSW Health, patients, and the private sector, and are generally relatively simple to administer.\"\n\nA WNSWLHD spokesperson said working with the private sector was \"not currently required\" because its existing resources were \"activated\" when needed.\n\nThey said there had been discussions about robotic surgical equipment with clinicians and that the development of a new clinical services plan was underway.",

        "text": "An audit into DevelopmentWA, sparked in part by the conviction of a former public servant who stole millions of taxpayer dollars, has found significant vulnerabilities to fraud at the government-owned entity.\n\nDevelopmentWA is one of Western Australia's biggest land and property developers, but unlike commercial developers, it is owned by the state government \u2014 meaning any profits or losses belong to taxpayers.\n\nAuditor-general Caroline Spencer said the intention of the audit, which looked at transactions between 2017 and 2022, was to determine whether there were irregularities in public land sale information that could indicate fraud, corruption or misconduct.\n\nCaroline Spencer says DevelopmentWA could not show value for money was achieved in all of its public land sales. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\"We have the dubious honour here in WA of the largest known public sector fraud with Paul Whyte,\" she told ABC Radio Perth's Drive program.\n\n\"He was the head of the housing authority within the Department of Communities, and so we saw through the Corruption and Crime Commission's hearings that land was identified as a way that you could settle gambling debts if someone was given the heads up \u2014 you know, 'buy this land because the government will be buying it in the future'.\n\nPaul Whyte was at the centre of one of WA's biggest corruption scandals. (ABC News: Hugh Sando)\n\n\"And so we saw there a case where a seller got $260,000 profit just by, if you like, buying it in advance of a government purchase.\n\n\"We wanted to see if there was any unreasonable growth in value, or properties selling too low, over a five-year period [at DevelopmentWA].\n\n\" Absolutely there could have been fraud within this period. \"\n\nProperty valued at $800k sold for $385k\n\nMs Spencer said her office was able to identify a number of serious issues that meant DevelopmentWA was unable to demonstrate value for money had been achieved in all of the public land sales.\n\n\"We found that one property sold for more than 50 per cent lower than its most recent valuation, with no formal rationale documented on the files, so the most recent valuation was $800,000 and then it was sold for $385,000,\" she said.\n\nDevelopmentWA, one of the state\u2019s biggest land and property developers, is owned by the WA government. (ABC Pilbara: Susan Standen)\n\n\"We found 50 per cent of 1,100 properties under a regional stimulus program, during the audit period, didn't demonstrate compliance with approved pricing methods.\n\n\"We've got a case study of a piece of land that's four times larger than the lot next door drop to the same price with no justification why.\"\n\nMuch of the detail in the report highlights issues with appropriate documentation and the following of proper processes, which Ms Spencer said led her to the conclusion that fraud could have been taking place.\n\nThe audit details serious risks at DevelopmentWA. (ABC News: Kenith Png)\n\n\"If you look at it like Swiss cheese, that you get too many holes and gaps in process and people not doing their job reviewing what's being done by the staff around them and you line up those holes, then you can get things getting through,\" she said.\n\n\"So absolutely there could have been fraud within this period.\"\n\nCommercial interests seek influence\n\nMs Spencer stressed the importance of DevelopmentWA, and those who work for it, understanding why following appropriate processes was so important.\n\n\"What you have to understand in this environment is there are commercial interests here \u2026 third parties that DevelopmentWA interacts with, they are going to want to sell property for the highest value or buy property from government for the lowest value,\" she said.\n\n\"And so every decision that is made by this agency to sell property needs to be properly documented, it needs to be on an approved basis.\"\n\nThe probe covers a five-year period from 2017-2022. (ABC News: Kenith Png)\n\nAnother area of concern for the auditor-general was the lax way in which conflicts of interest, gifts and benefits had been handled at the government agency.\n\n\"Being aware that people are going to seek to influence you and maintaining impartiality so you can have fair dealing with all developers, with all residential or industrial buyers of state-owned land is really important,\" she said.\n\n\"We had 891 invitations where the information was incomplete to understand what was the benefit to DevelopmentWA, what was the actual management of that potential conflict of interest by the entity for those staff members.\"\n\nSigns of shift in culture\n\nIn both her audit and in talking on ABC Radio Perth, Ms Spencer highlighted that a change in leadership at the board level had led to a better culture within DevelopmentWA in recent times, but stressed those changes needed to continue.\n\nWA Labor promised $298 million to local sports projects. A new audit has found only $36m was justified Photo shows Photographs of a report pages laying on a table An Auditor General report finds hundreds of millions of dollars were allocated to sporting and community projects without any evidence of them being rigorously assessed.\n\nA number of recommendations were made in the audit, and DevelopmentWA responded by saying while it \"believes it has solid foundations of well-defined policies and procedures, it acknowledges best-practice requires constant evolution and improvement\".\n\n\"DevelopmentWA's Board and Executive will build on these audit findings and continue to strive for the highest standards in governance and decision-making robustness,\" it finished.\n\nMs Spencer tabled the Fraud Risks in Land Transactions by Development WA report in parliament on Wednesday and said her office would continue to have oversight.\n\n\"This is the biggest audit that my office has done on this organisation. It doesn't normally get this level of scrutiny,\" she said.\n\n\"But \u2026 we're going to continue to monitor the governance and the transactions and the transfers of state land to ensure that the public interest is served.\"",

Yet not only does your vessel remain intact\u2014it accelerates ahead.\"\n\nThat's how Saxo Global Head of Investment Strategy Jacob Falkencrone describes Nvidia's recent quarterly earnings.\n\nHe says the tech giant \"powered through intense geopolitical headwinds, particularly stemming from escalating US-China tensions and export restrictions\".\n\nNvidia reported quarterly revenues of US$44.1 billion, up 69 per cent year-over-year, surpassing analyst forecasts.\n\n\"The data-centre segment, central to Nvidia's success, soared to $US39.1 billion, a 73 per cent increase,\" Falkencrone noted.\n\n\"Nvidia's data-centre revenue now dwarfs that of all its closest rivals combined, underscoring its dominance as the preferred supplier of AI infrastructure to tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.\n\n\"However, for investors, it's the resilience beneath these impressive figures that truly matters.\"\n\nFalkencrone says Nvidia is in a \"uniquely complex position\" being \"right at the intersection of geopolitical tensions and transformative AI innovation\".\n\n\"The risks it faces from China are significant, but so too are its strategic opportunities globally, evidenced by substantial new partnerships in places like Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n\"The immediate challenge for Nvidia\u2014and thus its investors\u2014is clear: the company must successfully navigate these geopolitical storms while delivering on its ambitious technological roadmap.

        "text": "When all the hype and the fury is stripped away, the decision to extend the life of the gigantic North West Shelf gas plant boils down to one thing.\n\n\"It's really all about Browse,\" says RISC Advisory boss Martin Wilkes in relation to the huge gas field off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia.\n\nBrowse is one of the country's biggest untapped resources projects, with gas reserves large enough to meet the equivalent of Australia's entire domestic demand for almost 20 years.\n\nTo the Western Australian government and the state's industry, it represents energy security, jobs and billions of dollars of investment.\n\nAnd for some of the world's biggest oil and gas companies \u2014 not to mention Australia's flag-bearer, Woodside \u2014 Browse presents as the last great hurrah for the country's gas export industry.\n\nBut the problem is Browse is a long way from anywhere.\n\nIt's also full of carbon.\n\nWhat's more, it has no shortage of detractors.\n\nFor those reasons, it has always remained an elusive development for its backers since being discovered more than half a century ago.\n\nThe North West Shelf is therefore the only viable pathway to development Browse has left, according to those in the industry who have followed the project for decades.\n\n\"They want to bring Browse back to the North West Shelf, which has been on the cards for a pretty long time, really,\" Mr Wilkes explains.\n\n\"And that development has nowhere to go unless they got an extension of the North West Shelf.\n\n\"It's a big gas field, but it's in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\"That's why it hasn't been developed \u2014 it's hard.\"\n\nProtesters are calling the approval a \"lightening rod\" for anger. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nBy provisionally extending the licence for the North West Shelf to operate another 40 years to 2070, Canberra has thrown Browse a lifeline.\n\nBut in doing so, it has also set itself on a collision course.\n\nThat's because Browse is likely to be the mother-of-all environmental fights \u2014 a pivotal clash between those seeking an end to new fossil fuel mega-project and those in the opposite corner.\n\nAlex Hillman from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) says the resistance to any bid to develop Browse will be fierce.\n\n\"It's insane,\" Mr Hillman says of the decision announced on Wednesday.\n\n\"This will get people marching on the streets.\n\n\" This is the lightning rod \u2014 this is kind of like its own level of protest that would come out of this project progressing. \"\n\nQuestion marks hang over viability of carbon capture\n\nClimate groups have labelled Browse a \"carbon bomb\", claiming the project could lead to emissions of up to 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over its lifetime \u2014 an amount three times Australia's annual pollution output.\n\nEven if Woodside can capture carbon, it will still only have a tiny impact on the total facility's lifetime emissions. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nIn anticipation of this charge, Woodside and its project partners in Browse have pivoted in recent times to say they'll try to capture and bury much of the carbon contained in the Browse gas fields.\n\nIndeed, the carbon content of Browse is in its own right significant.\n\nCarbon dioxide accounts for as much as 12 per cent of the fields' reserves \u2014 far higher than most projects and utterly dwarfing Woodside's Scarborough development, which has a carbon content of less than 1 per cent.\n\nCarbon capture a solution or distraction? Photo shows A drone image of Chevron's Gorgon project on Barrow Island. Amid the spinifex on a remote WA island looms Chevron's troubled carbon capture facility. The role the technology might play in cutting greenhouse gas emissions is likely to get a fresh airing at global climate talks in Azerbaijan.\n\nMr Hillman says there are big question marks still hanging over the effectiveness and viability of carbon capture and storage technologies.\n\nHe points to the well-documented challenges at the Gorgon LNG project off the Pilbara coast, where US behemoth Chevron has struggled to make the technology work.\n\nEven if Woodside could do a better job, he says it would barely make a difference, noting the lion's share of emissions from gas projects come from the burning of the fuel \u2014 not the release of carbon from the fields.\n\nAnd on this score \u2014 the measure of so-called scope 3 emissions \u2014 he says the Browse partners aren't proposing to do much of anything at all.\n\n\"The vast bulk of emissions is still in the scope three for customers,\" Mr Hillman says.\n\n\"If Woodside manages to implement carbon capture and storage and it manages to do it successfully \u2026 it's still only a tiny impact on the total facility's lifetime emissions.\"\n\nOthers take a different view.\n\nAn image showing how the Browse project will work. (Supplied: Woodside)\n\nThe enduring appeal of Browse comes back to WA's economy\n\nSteve Lewis is an industry veteran whose consultancy, BrightSource, helps gas users such as mines buy the fuel.\n\nMr Lewis says to understand the enduring appeal of Browse it's first necessary to get a handle on the composition of WA's economy.\n\nHe notes that gas is still the main fuel used for so much of the state's industrial base, from mineral processing to mining.\n\nAnd much more than other states, he says the west is still heavily dependent on gas to generate electricity \u2014 a dependency that's only likely to grow deeper amid efforts to get out of state-owned coal by the end of the decade.\n\nWhile gas accounts for only a tiny share of the electricity mix on the eastern seaboard, he says in WA its more like a third.\n\nSuch is WA's need for gas, he notes the state uses more of the fuel in its own economy than all of the eastern states combined despite having a much smaller population.\n\nWoodside intends to build two floating production storage and offloading facilities, which look like big ships, for the Browse Project. (Supplied: Woodside)\n\n\"Western Australia has a long history of gas usage going back to the 80s,\" Mr Lewis says.\n\n\"It's very significant for the state.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Lewis, the North West Shelf itself marked the beginning of WA's modern gas industry and, more broadly, Australia's presence as an LNG superpower.\n\nBut he notes the fields which have underpinned the North West Shelf and its colossal importance \u2014 the facility once accounted for 1 per cent of Australia's economy \u2014 are in terminal decline.\n\nKeeping a huge asset alive for longer\n\nTo that end, Mr Lewis says the decision to extend the life of the gas plant is aimed at solving two problems \u2014 keeping a huge, valuable asset alive for longer and enabling the development of another one.\n\nBy piping Browse gas 900 kilometres south and processing it through the North West Shelf, he says Woodside et al would avoid the need for a new LNG plant that would come at huge cost.\n\nSecondly, and by extension, they would also pay less in processing \u2014 or \"tolling\" \u2014 fees to the Shelf than they would in depreciation at a vastly expensive new LNG plant.\n\nWoodside's Karratha Gas Plant would process gas from the Browse Basin. (Supplied: Woodside)\n\nAfter all, he says, the costs of building the North West Shelf have already been recovered by its owners.\n\n\"It's all about encouraging more gas supply into the state by using existing infrastructure,\" he says.\n\n\"And that's an economically efficient way to develop gas fields and gas projects \u2014 to use existing infrastructure to toll new gas to ensure there's enough gas for the state going forward.\"\n\nIn the absence of Browse, Mr Lewis reckons WA is headed for structural shortages in gas that could have painful consequences for the state's economy.\n\nAluminium refineries that are WA's biggest users of gas could struggle to survive, he warns, shortfalls would lead to sky-high prices that would also make it harder to build gas-fired generators needed to help replace retiring coal plants.\n\nPerversely, Mr Lewis says a raft of new critical minerals processing plants required for the energy transition could also be hit \u2014 or left on the drawing board.\n\nOn Western Australia's Burrup Peninsula, sacred Aboriginal rock art sits near a major gas plant and other chemical plants. (ABC News: Charlie McLean)\n\n\"It becomes pretty challenging,\" Mr Lewis says, if Browse is never developed.\n\n\"The market operator forecast is there won't be sufficient supply from around 2028, 2029 onwards unless significant new amounts of gas come into the market.\n\n\"And that's really just a function of existing fields in decline.\"\n\nFor Mr Wilkes and Mr Lewis, an extension of the North West Shelf's operating licence is one thing, but access to enough gas to keep its giant refrigerators turning natural gas into LNG is another.\n\nA mockery of Australia's greenhouse gas ambitions\n\nThere are already indications about what might happen in the event of a failure on that front.\n\n'See you in court': Climate advocates left devastated by gas project decision Photo shows Giant metal pipes form part of the Karratha gas plant, with two workers dwarfed by its size. The Greens, the Australian Conservation Federation and traditional owners are among those expressing their opposition to Woodside's North West Shelf expansion approval.\n\nLast year, Woodside shut one of these refrigerators \u2014 or trains as they are known in the industry \u2014 that had been part of the original development more than 40 years ago.\n\n\"There are several implications, aren't there,\" says Mr Wilkes when asked about what would happen if insufficient amounts of gas are found to replace depleting supplies at the North West Shelf.\n\n\"One is that facility gets dismantled and abandoned earlier than it would have done otherwise.\n\n\"Another is the gas never gets to market, never gets produced.\"\n\nFor Mr Hillman from the ACCR, that would be best outcome.\n\nHe reckons the dogged pursuit of Browse by its corporate and political backers flies in the face of commercial common sense, saying the project comes with huge risks and may never be profitable.\n\nBowse's plans could fly in the face of plans to wipe out Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. (Supplied: Australian Institute of Marine Science)\n\nWorse still, he argues, Browse would make a mockery of Australia's ambitions to stamp out greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonise by the middle of the century.\n\n\"This just enables Woodside to continue making bad decisions with investor funds,\" Mr Hillman says.\n\n\"It enables Woodside to chase this dream of investing in this project which it's been trying and failing to do for years.\n\n\"We don't think Browse stacks up financially, but that doesn't mean the project won't happen.",

        "text": "The Seven football advertisement which ran in the Herald Sun on Tuesday, May 27. Credit: Herald Sun An industry expert said the ad would cost between $8000 and $16,000. The message was simple, but multilayered, placed provocatively in a News Corp paper \u2013 the Rupert Murdoch company that will hand control of Foxtel to UK sports streaming service DAZN in the second half of this year as part of a $3.4 billion deal. When asked about the ad on Tuesday, Seven\u2019s director of sport Chris Jones said the network wanted people to know they would \u201cturn up and be at every single match\u201d they covered this year. \u201cThat comes at great expense, but it certainly has a big impact on the coverage and makes the commentators\u2019 lives a whole heap easier,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is a really important message for us to put out.\u201d When asked about Taylor\u2019s jab at Fox, Jones said he loved it when BT was being himself and calling uninhibited. Taylor was contacted for comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult as a lead caller or as an expert commentator to be able to get the full perspective of what is going on when they are not at the ground,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is something that we are really happy to invest in because we think it has a material impact on the coverage. Seven\u2019s Brian Taylor had a crack at Fox Footy. Credit: Simon Schluter \u201cSo for BT to be able to be there and to be able to get down to ground level, talk the players before the game, speak to those in and around the team, and then be able to have that full perspective of the ground \u2013 it is certainly something that gives him the best chance of calling and being his best.\u201d Jones would not be drawn on Foxtel\u2019s decision to call a Melbourne match from its Melbourne studio.\n\nLoading \u201cWhat I want to do is always focus on what Channel Seven are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a view on what others are doing. But I do know what makes our coverage the best it can possibly be, and being at venues is something that we\u2019ve put a major focus on, which is why we will be at every game this year.\u201d Foxtel declined to comment, but the company is flying a commentary team to Brisbane to call Thursday\u2019s match between the Lions and Essendon at the Gabba. Helping anchor Seven\u2019s Thursday night coverage will be Jones\u2019 No.1 recruit and chief agitator Kane Cornes, who dominated coverage last week by having a verbal dust-up with Western Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge before the game.\n\nCornes continues to make headlines after last year defecting from Nine, publisher of this masthead, in a move that sparked a battleground on a different front in the footy wars. Jones poached Cornes as well as his long-time friend Craig Hutchison and award-winning journalist Caroline Wilson from Nine to create Seven\u2019s mid-week footy panel, The Agenda Setters, a news-breaking and analytical program that goes head-to-head with Nine\u2019s Footy Classified. Seven\u2019s team on the Monday night edition of The Agenda Setters. Jones also recruited former Fox Footy headline act Nick Riewoldt to join Seven\u2019s coverage, while Shaun Burgoyne jumped from Seven to Fox and Leigh Matthews crossed from Nine to Fox. \u201cWhat we have done this year is create a seven-day-a-week strategy where there is brand-new football content every day of the week,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThat is a strategy that clearly has worked with many new shows, new attitudes, and we are very proud of what we have been able to do to this point in the season, but we have got a lot of work to do still.\u201d This season, Fox Footy has assigned a commentary team for every match of every round, rather than last year\u2019s model of taking Seven\u2019s feed when the free-to-air network was the host broadcaster. Just who is winning the war is yet to emerge as the networks continue to cobble together their mid-season ratings and accompanying spin. On Thursday morning, Foxtel released figures trumpeting the success of its sport streaming service Kayo Sports, saying Kayo\u2019s year-on-year numbers were up 25 per cent, Thursday nights were up 41 per cent and Friday nights 30 per cent. Fox Footy numbers were not released. The Collingwood-Geelong clash in round eight on a Saturday night was Kayo\u2019s most streamed match of the season with an audience of 389,000, while its Saturday audiences are up 27 per cent.",

        "text": "A United States trade court has blocked Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs from going into effect, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the US than they buy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Manhattan-based Court of International Trade said the US constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries that is not overridden by the president's emergency powers to safeguard the US economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President's use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it,\" a three-judge panel said in the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states.\n\n\n\nThe companies, which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments, have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending.\n\n\n\n\n\nOregon attorney-general Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states' lawsuit, called Trump's tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,\" Rayfield said in a statement.\n\n\n\nTrump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is meant to address \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats during a national emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe justice department has said the lawsuits should be dismissed because the plaintiffs have not been harmed by tariffs that they have not yet paid, and because only Congress, not private businesses, can challenge a national emergency declared by the president under IEEPA.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn imposing the tariffs in early April, Trump called the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his 10 per cent across-the-board tariffs on all imports, with higher rates for countries with which the US has the largest trade deficits, particularly China.\n\n\n\nMany of those country-specific tariffs were subsequently paused. The Trump administration announced on 12 May that it would also temporarily reduce the steepest tariffs on China while working on a longer-term trade deal. Both countries agreed to cut tariffs on each other for at least 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's on-and-off-again tariffs, which he has said are intended to restore US manufacturing capability, have shocked US financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US dollar rose against both the Swiss franc, a traditional currency safe-haven, and the Japanese yen following the court decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trade court's decision can be appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, and ultimately the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As we enter the colder months in Australia, COVID-19 is making headlines again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated NB.1.8.1 as a \"variant under monitoring\", owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what do you need to know about this new variant?\n\n\n\nThe current COVID-19 situation\n\nMore than five years since COVID-19 was initially declared a pandemic, we're still experiencing regular waves of infections.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But available data suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were ticking upwards.\n\n\n\nGenomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is among the circulating strains in Australia, and is generally increasing. Of cases sequenced up to 6 May across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10 per cent in South Australia to more than 40 per cent in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nWastewater surveillance in Western Australia has determined NB.1.8.1 is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples collected in Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternationally, NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By late April 2025, it comprised roughly 10.7 per cent of all submitted sequences \u2014 up from just 2.5 per cent four weeks before. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nNB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia \u2014 it was the dominant variant in Hong Kong and China at the end of April.\n\n\n\nWhere does this variant come from?\n\nAccording to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected in samples collected in January 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. \"Recombinant\" is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.\n\n\n\nWhat does the research say?\n\nLike its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries a suite of mutations in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us, specifically via the ACE2 receptors, a \"doorway\" to our cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mutations include T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It's early days for this variant, so we don't have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a recent preprint (a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction.\n\n\n\nUsing lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested \u2014 suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or \"block\" the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower against NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, LP.8.1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means it's possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.\n\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes more severe disease compared to other variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nReports suggest symptoms of NB.1.8.1 should align closely with other Omicron subvariants.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.\n\n\n\nHow about the vaccine?\n\nThere's potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia's winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated COVID-19 boosters.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if neutralising antibody levels are modestly reduced against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted COVID-19 vaccines should still protect against severe disease with this variant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries targets JN.1, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense that it should still offer good protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another COVID-19 booster if you're eligible. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, COVID-19 can still be a serious disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nLara Herrero receives funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\n\n\n",

Littleproud will remain as agriculture spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberals, who are still the majority party despite losing 13 lower house seats, got the biggest portfolios.\n\n\n\n\n\nTed O'Brien, architect of the Coalition's nuclear election pitch, has been promoted to treasury spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe replaces Angus Taylor, who ran against Ley for the Liberal leadership and has since been moved to be defence spokesperson.\n\n\n\nMichaelia Cash has been elevated to foreign ministry spokesperson, James Paterson is the finance spokesperson and Andrew Hastie will take on home affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nJulian Leeser retakes his old role as shadow attorney-general after he resigned from the shadow cabinet to campaign for the Indigenous Voice referendum in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Tehan takes on energy and emissions reduction, with Ley downplaying the removal of climate change from the portfolio title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I look at the substance of what's going on and the policy areas and don't get hung up on the titles,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals deputy Kevin Hogan retains trade and Senate leader Bridget McKenzie keeps infrastructure.\n\n\n\nWho has been demoted?\n\nA notable absence from the shadow cabinet was former finance spokesperson Jane Hume, who oversaw the Coalition's disastrous work-from-home policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey denied Hume and other conservatives, such as Sarah Henderson, had been punished for supporting Angus Taylor during the Liberal leadership spill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely not. I'm not going to reflect on the qualities of individuals with respect to the qualities of other individuals.

Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was demoted to the outer ministry after defecting from the Nationals to the Liberals.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe will become the Opposition's defence industry and personnel spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud denied similar claims of vengeance after both former national leader Michael McCormack and Barnaby Joyce questioned his leadership in recent days and were not offered positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I made it clear when I became leader three years ago that I wanted to have generational change but, at that point, wanted to respect the leadership that was before me to allow them to impart their wisdom,\" Littleproud said.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland senator Matt Canavan is also absent from the shadow ministry, allowing him to break cabinet solidarity on issues such as net zero.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Sussan Ley faces net zero challenge amid personal struggles in first week\n\nLey denies 'bitter break up' amid new Coalition agreement\n\nLey denied the Coalition's temporary split had been \"bitter\", maintaining that she gets along well with Littleproud and looks forward to moving \"forward together\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Personally, David and I will be friends,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think a woman who got her start in the shearing sheds of western Queensland can always find something to talk about over a steak and a beer, David, with you, the person who represents those communities now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Tuesday, Nationals leader David Littleproud announced his party would be leaving the Coalition as it wanted to cement four policy areas into the agreement.\n\n\n\nThis included lifting a moratorium on nuclear, powers to split up the major supermarkets, a $20 billion regional fund and mobile coverage in the bush.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberals wanted time to review their election policy agenda after a historic loss but offered to support the demands \"in principle\" by the end of the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter days of conjecture over the terms of the split, the Nationals party room met on Wednesday morning to sign off on the agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud noted negotiations over the week with Ley had been effective, despite \"gossip and innuendo through the halls of the gallery\", seemingly a shot at the Canberra reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sussan and I have always kept the lines of communication open. We\u2019ve risen above that. We haven\u2019t let us get distracted by what\u2019s been reported.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Seven football advertisement which ran in the Herald Sun on Tuesday, May 27. Credit: Herald Sun An industry expert said the ad would cost between $8000 and $16,000. The message was simple, but multilayered, placed provocatively in a News Corp paper \u2013 the Rupert Murdoch company that will hand control of Foxtel to UK sports streaming service DAZN in the second half of this year as part of a $3.4 billion deal. When asked about the ad on Tuesday, Seven\u2019s director of sport Chris Jones said the network wanted people to know they would \u201cturn up and be at every single match\u201d they covered this year. \u201cThat comes at great expense, but it certainly has a big impact on the coverage and makes the commentators\u2019 lives a whole heap easier,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is a really important message for us to put out.\u201d When asked about Taylor\u2019s jab at Fox, Jones said he loved it when BT was being himself and calling uninhibited. Taylor was contacted for comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult as a lead caller or as an expert commentator to be able to get the full perspective of what is going on when they are not at the ground,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is something that we are really happy to invest in because we think it has a material impact on the coverage. Seven\u2019s Brian Taylor had a crack at Fox Footy. Credit: Simon Schluter \u201cSo for BT to be able to be there and to be able to get down to ground level, talk the players before the game, speak to those in and around the team, and then be able to have that full perspective of the ground \u2013 it is certainly something that gives him the best chance of calling and being his best.\u201d Jones would not be drawn on Foxtel\u2019s decision to call a Melbourne match from its Melbourne studio.\n\nLoading \u201cWhat I want to do is always focus on what Channel Seven are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a view on what others are doing. But I do know what makes our coverage the best it can possibly be, and being at venues is something that we\u2019ve put a major focus on, which is why we will be at every game this year.\u201d Foxtel declined to comment, but the company is flying a commentary team to Brisbane to call Thursday\u2019s match between the Lions and Essendon at the Gabba. Helping anchor Seven\u2019s Thursday night coverage will be Jones\u2019 No.1 recruit and chief agitator Kane Cornes, who dominated coverage last week by having a verbal dust-up with Western Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge before the game.\n\nCornes continues to make headlines after last year defecting from Nine, publisher of this masthead, in a move that sparked a battleground on a different front in the footy wars. Jones poached Cornes as well as his long-time friend Craig Hutchison and award-winning journalist Caroline Wilson from Nine to create Seven\u2019s mid-week footy panel, The Agenda Setters, a news-breaking and analytical program that goes head-to-head with Nine\u2019s Footy Classified. Seven\u2019s team on the Monday night edition of The Agenda Setters. Jones also recruited former Fox Footy headline act Nick Riewoldt to join Seven\u2019s coverage, while Shaun Burgoyne jumped from Seven to Fox and Leigh Matthews crossed from Nine to Fox. \u201cWhat we have done this year is create a seven-day-a-week strategy where there is brand-new football content every day of the week,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThat is a strategy that clearly has worked with many new shows, new attitudes, and we are very proud of what we have been able to do to this point in the season, but we have got a lot of work to do still.\u201d This season, Fox Footy has assigned a commentary team for every match of every round, rather than last year\u2019s model of taking Seven\u2019s feed when the free-to-air network was the host broadcaster. Just who is winning the war is yet to emerge as the networks continue to cobble together their mid-season ratings and accompanying spin. On Thursday morning, Foxtel released figures trumpeting the success of its sport streaming service Kayo Sports, saying Kayo\u2019s year-on-year numbers were up 25 per cent, Thursday nights were up 41 per cent and Friday nights 30 per cent. Fox Footy numbers were not released. The Collingwood-Geelong clash in round eight on a Saturday night was Kayo\u2019s most streamed match of the season with an audience of 389,000, while its Saturday audiences are up 27 per cent.",

        "text": "Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner has bitten back after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese criticised the council\u2019s management of the Story Bridge:\n\nI\u2019ve been working closely with Federal Minister King, however, I\u2019m also happy to brief the Prime Minister on the independent report written by respected experts, which found we\u2019ve been excellent stewards of the Story Bridge.\n\nAs the report noted, we have invested more than $120 million into maintaining the Story Bridge over the past 20 years in addition to investing $3 million into ongoing maintenance every year over the long term.\n\nThe Story Bridge is an 85-year-old national icon that was only built to last 100 years and we want to restore it so it can last another 100 years, just like we did with City Hall.\n\nThe latest advice states the Story Bridge footpaths would need to be replaced \u201cin the next two to five years,\u201d however, we\u2019re progressing a replacement sooner to ensure they\u2019re safe.\n\nWhat we\u2019re proposing now is a long-term restoration project over the next 15 to 20 years, just like what has been undertaken on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in recent times.\n\nThe state and federal governments collect 97 cents in every tax dollar paid, which is why we\u2019re saying no to a toll and yes to sustained investment from all three levels of government.",

        "text": "The increasing frequency of weather events means Aussie holiday operators are facing multiple disasters with little time in between to recover.\n\nAussies staying at the Weeroona Holiday Park on NSW's Mid North Coast were forced to flee last week after it flooded for the second time in four years. Source: Supplied\n\nWith the rain pelting on his back and a torch in one hand, Bren Abbott-Hammel waded through the deep floodwaters at his family\u2019s caravan park late on Thursday night last week, banging on vans and urging those still inside to evacuate. In a scene that was all too familiar, the Weeroona Holiday Park in Manning Point, on NSW\u2019s Mid North Coast, was underwater for the second time in a little over four years.\n\nWhile the majority of the park's 24 permanent residents, short-stay visitors and campers had already fled the area, a few people appeared to be \u201cin a little bit of denial\u201d about facing another emergency given the \u201cclose time frame\u201d between the catastrophic flooding events.\n\n\u201cThere were some people that didn\u2019t hear me, and around 2.30am I got a phone call from a lady who was woken up by the water hitting her in bed,\u201d he told Yahoo News. \u201cI walked and swam down to her and then carried her out with a couple of bags and whatnot.\u201d\n\nTragically, many of those who call the caravan park home had \u201conly recently\u201d recovered from the 2021 flood, only to have to start from scratch once again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey finally got their place set up after chipping away at it for the last four years, and then it\u2019s just happened again, and all that hard work and sacrifice and saving money just gets ripped away,\u201d Abbott-Hammel, whose parents took over Weeroona in 2023, said, noting the heartbreaking loss of sentimental items such as photos.\n\n\u201cAll the vans are 100 per cent uninhabitable at the moment, and all the campgrounds are completely useless to the point of the power being cut off.\u201d\n\nIt could take months before the family-run caravan park is running as normal. Source: Supplied\n\nExtreme weather a serious 'concern' for caravan park\n\nWhile recovery efforts began after the water started to recede on Saturday, it could take months before the caravan park returns to normal, leaving Abbott-Hammel pondering the effect of Australia\u2019s natural disasters on the tourism industry.\n\n\u201cThe weather has become more extreme, so what does that mean for tourism-related businesses? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other industries impacted but for us it\u2019s less than ideal,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Aussie admitted he has had several conversations with family members about the \u201cdirect loss of revenue\u201d and the \u201cdefinite possibility\u201d of the flood zone\u2019s reputation putting people off visiting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern, and I have seen it before,\u201d he told Yahoo, explaining that several campers decided to leave early in April after a predicted 60mm of rainfall. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t get to measure the people who don\u2019t come because they are afraid.\u201d\n\nThe damage caused to the roads could also deter travellers, given they are often hauling a $100,000 to $150,000 caravan with them.\n\nHypothetically, if Weeroona Holiday Park was unable to recover from last week\u2019s floods, which also claimed the lives of five people, the other small businesses in the area would also suffer, Abbott-Hammel said.\n\n\u201cThe general store, they will struggle. The bowls club, I assume they would lose 20 to 30 per cent of their business.\u201d And he\u2019s not the only one with concerns.\n\nEvery single caravan at the Weeroona Holiday Park is currently inhabitable, with residents grieving the loss of precious items like photos. Source: Supplied\n\nClimate change has devastating impacts on Aussie tourism\n\nNSW\u2019s Mid-North Coast has experienced back-to-back extreme weather events in the last few years and communities are suffering the consequences \u201cagain and again\u201d, Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said this week, pointing the finger at what she said is the \u201croot cause\" \u2014 \"pollution from coal, oil and gas\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is critical that we understand that such disasters are no longer simply \u2018natural\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nThe increasing frequency and severity of such events means residents are facing successive disasters with little time in between to recover, which could ultimately hurt the country\u2019s tourism industry in the long run.\n\n\u201cThe impact of climate change has had devastating impacts on tourism businesses all over the country and over time, it has caused people to close their doors,\u201d Dr Heather Downey told Yahoo. Repeatedly cleaning up and dealing with insurance companies and various government agencies, as well as the \u201cemotional element\u201d, can take a huge toll on Aussies, the associate professor of social work at La Trobe said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult time. Then, you have to contact people who\u2019ve made bookings and let them know what\u2019s going on, it's a multi layered event,\u201d Downey added. \u201cUnless something is done about root causes of climate change, we can expect increased severity and frequency of these types of devastating events.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe page has been created to help provide the Weeroona Holiday Park with necessary supplies.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
