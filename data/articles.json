        "text": "The Australian share market is down almost 1.2 per cent in early trade, dragged down by a sharp plunge on Wall Street overnight.\n\nThe ASX200 hit a four-month low for the Australian market , opening 0.8 per cent down after shaving 64.8 points to hit 8571.6.\n\n\n\nThe US stock market sank overnight as Nvidia and other \"superstar\" stocks created by the frenzy around artificial intelligence technology dimmed some more.\n\nA trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday (Tuesday AEST).Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg (Bloomberg)\n\nIn the US, the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent and pulled further from its all-time high set late last month.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 557 points, or 1.2 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.8 per cent.\n\nNvidia was the heaviest weight on the market, as it\u2019s often been in its last couple of tumultuous weeks. The chip company fell 1.8 per cent, while losses for other AI winners included a 6.4 per cent slide for Super Micro Computer.\n\nOther areas of the market that had been high-momentum winners also sank. Bitcoin fell below $US92,000 ($141,000) down from nearly $US125,000 last month, for example.\n\nThat helped drag down Coinbase Global by 7.1 per cent and Robinhood Markets by 5.3 per cent.\n\nJensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp, during the keynote address at the Nvidia AI summit in Washington, DC, last month. (Bloomberg)\n\nCritics have warned US stock market could be primed for a drop because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive. Critics point in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania, which have been surging at spectacular speeds for years.\n\nDespite its loss overnight, Nvidia is still up 39 per cent for the year so far after it doubled in price in four of the past five years.\n\nThat has Wall Street\u2019s spotlight on Wednesday (Thursday AEST), when Nvidia will report how much profit it made during the summer.\n\nAI stocks have surged as much as they have because of expectations that they\u2019ll produce huge growth in profits. If they fail to top analysts\u2019 expectations, that would undercut one of the big assumptions that\u2019s driven the US stock market to records.\n\nSuch high expectations extend beyond tech stocks, even if they are toughest for AI darlings.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Pauline Hanson plans to woo Barnaby Joyce to One Nation over a hearty dinner\n\nAramark fell 5.2 per cent after the company reported a profit for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe company, which offers food and facilities management for schools, national parks and convention centres, also said it expects an underlying measure of profit to grow between 20 per cent and 25 per cent this upcoming year.\n\nWhile relatively strong, that was less than what analysts had been forecasting.\n\nThat helped offset a rise of 3.1 per cent for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which jumped after Berkshire Hathaway said it built a $US4.34 billion ownership stake.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, run by famed investor Warren Buffett, is notorious for trying to buy stocks only when they look like good values while avoiding anything that looks too expensive.\n\nAnother source of potential disappointment for Wall Street is what the US Federal Reserve does with interest rates.\n\nThe expectation had been that the Fed would keep cutting interest rates in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market. Wall Street loves lower rates because they can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff TPG confirms Sydney death after customer was unable to contact triple zero\n\nBut questions are rising about whether a third cut for the year would come out of the Fed\u2019s next meeting in December, something that traders had earlier seen as very likely.\n\nThe downside of lower interest rates is that they can make inflation worse, and inflation has stubbornly remained above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target.\n\nFed officials have also pointed to the US government\u2019s shutdown, which delayed the release of updates on the job market and other signals about the economy.\n\nWith less information and less certainty about how things are going, some Fed officials have suggested it may be better to wait in December to get more clarity.\n\nNow that the shutdown is over, the government is preparing to release September\u2019s delayed jobs report on Thursday (Friday AEST). That could create further swings for the market.\n\nData that\u2019s very strong would likely stay the Fed\u2019s hand on rate cuts, while figures that are very weak would raise worries about the economy.\n\nIn 2026, the Fed is likely to cut interest rates only in response to a slowing economy instead of trying to cut ahead of it, according to Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel. That\u2019s not as good an environment for stock prices, and Bannister said the \u201cFed\u2019s \u2018free lunch\u2019 is over\".\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.13 per cent from 4.14 per cent late Friday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia.\n\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.1 per cent after the government reported that the Japanese economy contracted at a 1.8 per cent annual pace in the July-September quarter.",

(Tinted Love)\n\n\"This art is not just about aesthetics; it's often the final step in helping survivors to reclaim their bodies and restore their sense of hope and dignity,\" she said.\n\nAreola tattooing is a relatively new procedure available for breast cancer survivors and Cahn said she was therefore keen to let as many women as possible know about it.\n\nHowever, social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were constantly banning her photos and videos due to them being flagged as showing nudity, Cahn said.\n\n\"Social media platforms can't distinguish the difference between nudity and art,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't post anything on TikTok, they don't really allow any of my work.\"\n\nLikewise, Cahn said photos she posted to Facebook showing areola tattoos were often banned, after which she needed to go through a time-consuming process to have them reinstated.\n\nRachel Cahn is seen tattooing an areola on a client. (Tinted Love)\n\nCahn said other restrictions had been placed on her accounts, such as Instagram banning her from posting live videos for 12 months and Facebook blocking her from inviting people to join her page.\n\nThe cosmetic tattooist said she also suspected her accounts had been \"shadow banned\".\n\n\"Shadow banning is where you don't come up in people's feeds,\" she explained.\n\n\"You're not on the 'explore' page.

        "text": "The 2025 AFL draft is nearly here, and clubs will be putting the finishing touches on their plans in hopes of uncovering their next superstar.\n\nCheck out what picks each team will be bringing to draft night and which players could be in their sights.\n\nThe AFL draft will be held over two nights on November 19 and 20 and you can follow ABC Sport's live blog on both.\n\nAdelaide\n\nPicks 16, 48, 55, 61\n\nThe Crows fought extremely hard to keep their top pick, refusing to send it to Brisbane for Callum Ah Chee.\n\nAdelaide would love to get its hands on South Australian captain Dyson Sharp, but he's likely to be well out of the Crows' draft range, as will fellow Croweater Sam Cumming.\n\nHowever, the Crows could still wind up with a South Australian in the form of Mitch Marsh, a talented forward prospect.\n\nEastern Ranges halfback Oskar Taylor has also been linked to the Crows.\n\nBrisbane\n\nPicks 17, 23, 44, 51, 57\n\nWhat a brilliant position the Lions find themselves in for the second year running.\n\nDaniel Annable is a ready-made midfielder who will make the Lions even stronger. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nJust a few months after winning their second straight premiership, the Lions are poised to add the player some draft experts rate as the best prospect in this year's class in Daniel Annable.\n\nAnnable is an AFL-ready midfielder who is poised enough to jump straight into most midfields in the competition. The only problem for him is that Brisbane's midfield is not any normal midfield to just slide into, as Levi Ashcroft found out.\n\nThe only question for the Lions is just how early a bid on Annable, an academy prospect of theirs, will come. The timing of the bid, which many expect to be in the top five, will likely see most of the Lions' draft picks get eaten up.\n\nCarlton\n\nPicks 9, 11, 43, 54\n\nThe Blues are preparing for the exciting acquisition of key defender Harry Dean, a father-son prospect who could easily attract a bid inside the top five overall selections.\n\nThe Blues will do whatever it takes to match a bid on Dean, but will likely also try to get creative to ensure their night doesn't end there. That may mean trading pick nine, or 11 \u2014 or possibly both \u2014 to make sure it can keep a selection in this year's first round and possibly even secure another for next year.\n\nIf they do manage to keep a first-rounder this year, the Blues might like to look at someone like key forward Aidan Schubert and hope he slides. With Charlie Curnow no longer at the club, Schubert would fill a need and represent great value outside the top 10.\n\nTom De Koning's departure may see Carlton look for a new project ruck, and Louis Emmett would fit that bill. Or they could go completely the other way and look at electric small forward Lachy Dovaston, who would be an instant fan favourite.\n\nCollingwood\n\nPicks 39, 45, 56, 58, 67\n\nCollingwood's hand is not particularly compelling, but it will come into this draft with its sights set on one specific player at least.\n\nZac McCarthy is tied to the Pies through their Next Generation Academy and is a raw but exciting tall of great potential. McCarthy could yet receive a bid inside the first round, such is his potential, but the Magpies would be expected to match it.\n\nHow early that bid comes will determine the rest of Collingwood's draft, as the Magpies may only be able to select two more players should enough of those picks be swallowed up by matching an offer for McCarthy.\n\nFather-son prospect Thomas McGuane does not look likely to be picked up by the Pies in the national draft, as they opted against nominating him ahead of the cut-off. A rookie spot is not out of the question for McGuane.\n\nEssendon\n\nPicks 5, 6, 21, 27, 30\n\nEssendon is in a position to add the best available talent that falls past West Coast and Richmond.\n\nDyson Sharp is a tough contested midfielder and a strong leader at a young age. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nPlayers such as Sullivan Robey, Dyson Sharp and Sam Cumming have been most strongly linked to the Bombers with their first two picks, while Xavier Taylor would also fit nicely as an attacking intercept defender.\n\nThe Dons have two academy players in the draft, Adam Sweid and Hussein El Achkar, and haven't fully committed to drafting both just yet.\n\nSweid is tipped to be picked at the back end of the first round, and could land at the Bombers with one of the picks in the 20s.\n\nFremantle\n\nPicks 20, 47, 64, 72\n\nThe pressure is on Fremantle more than ever to have some tangible finals success after a disappointing elimination final exit at the hands of Gold Coast this year.\n\nFreo possesses a strong midfield and a number of game-changers forward of the ball, but its key defensive stocks can be vulnerable at times, often seeing Josh Treacy swing back into defence in tight situations, compromising the structure up the ground.\n\nKey defender Blake Thredgold from Sturt would be a nice addition for the Dockers here. Standing at 194 centimetres, Thredgold projects as an athletic defender who can become a prolific interceptor.\n\nGeelong\n\nPicks 19, 40\n\nPredicting Geelong's movements at the draft is a tricky exercise, though it is normally its later picks that bring the big surprises.\n\nWith a first-rounder at their disposal, the Cats will take best available as their list needs are few and far between. Speedy winger Harley Barker seems an excellent fit at Kardinia Park, and he would represent good value after an ACL injury halted his rise in 2025.\n\nA young tall forward like Archie Ludowyke may also appeal, and you can generally expect the Cats to fire off some bids on NGA talent rated around that pick.\n\nHunter Holmes, brother of Max, would be a sentimentally favoured pick among Cats fans later in the draft.\n\nGold Coast\n\nPicks 15, 18, 24, 28, 29, 36, 52\n\nOnce again the Suns come into a draft with peace of mind and a guarantee of a strong haul. In fact two of the best five players in this draft are guaranteed to be Suns by next Wednesday night.\n\nDylan Patterson is an excitement machine off half-back. (Getty Images: Josh Chadwick)\n\nZeke Uwland and Dylan Patterson are products of the Gold Coast academy, and even if bids come on those two inside the three or four picks on the night \u2014 which is very possible.\n\nBeau Addinsall is another highly regarded member of the Suns' academy and will garner a bid at some point, possibly late in the first or early in the second round. Jai Murray is another that Gold Coast will not want to let slip.\n\nThe Suns will be engaged in some pick swaps early on night one to ensure they are covered points-wise for any eventuality. Theirs is a very different draft experience to most clubs.\n\nGWS Giants\n\nPicks 12, 35, 73\n\nAs a team full of big-bodied midfielders and burly key forwards, the Giants are in the market to add some speed and craftiness to their list, particularly in the forward half of the ground.\n\nLively small forward Lachy Dovaston is a player who GWS would love to get its hands on, and one that would fit well with the rest of the list.\n\nSam Grlj is a chance to be selected by Richmond with one of its two top-10 picks, but if the Tigers do not take him, then he could potentially slip all the way down to the Giants' range.\n\nKeeping with the zippy forward theme, the Giants could snap up Latrelle Pickett, the cousin of Melbourne's Kysaiah, who has proven to be one of the late draft bolters this year.\n\nHawthorn\n\nPicks 10, 22, 59, 66\n\nThe Hawks will begin draft night with a top-10 pick, and though that will slide back considerably once the bids come in, it is still a great result for a club fresh off a preliminary final.\n\nMidfield improvement has been Hawthorn's stated aim this off-season, but there is unlikely to be any stand-out candidate for that area by the time its selection comes up. Jacob Farrow, who has shown promise in the middle despite playing mostly off half-back this year, could appeal in that range.\n\nThe Hawks tried to gain access to midfielder Ollie Greeves via their NGA this year but were denied, so he may still be in contention, more likely for the Hawks's second pick than the first.\n\nAnd then there's Lachy Dovaston. A Nick Watson clone, the thought of pairing those two in a forward line is one that should be encouraged \u2014 though perhaps there is a limit how many cheeky, mulleted goalsneaks one team can contain.\n\nMelbourne\n\nPicks 7, 8, 37, 63, 65\n\nThe Demons are guaranteed to bring some quality in with their two top-10 picks, though they will slide just beyond 10 after bids come in early, but are somewhat at the behest of the clubs ahead of them.\n\nSam Cumming is a versatile midfielder who can do the tough stuff and get forward to kick goals. (Getty Images: Mark Brake)\n\nDepending on which way West Coast, Richmond and Essendon go, Melbourne could have a raft of gun mids to pick from, a selection of talls or the draft's most dynamic little blokes.\n\nSam Cumming would be a dream pick for the midfield, and Dyson Sharp would fill the Clayton Oliver hole instantly. Aidan Schubert would be a fantastic boost to a struggling forward line, while Sam Grlj, Lachy Dovaston or bolter Cameron Nairn would certainly get fans through the gates.\n\nThe Demons can hardly go wrong with their two picks. They will be content to wait and see who is still available and pick their favourites from there.\n\nNorth Melbourne\n\nPicks 25, 26, 46\n\nThe Kangaroos are also in talent-acquisition mode, and will look to draft the best available player with their first pick.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the Roos are able to swing a draft-night trade by packaging their first two selections together to potentially move into the teens. If they do, expect a tall to be the target with Aidan Schubert and Blake Thredgold both good options.\n\nIf the Roos stay put, South Australian midfielder Harley Barker will come into their calculations.\n\nPort Adelaide\n\nPicks 49, 69\n\nThe Power will be out of action into the latter stages of this year's draft due to previous trades.\n\nPort has a high-powered midfield and will be keen on bolstering its key position departments, particularly in defence.\n\nIf it is willing to swing some of its existing big men around the ground, a prospect such as Murray Bushrangers forward Liam Hetherton would be nice selection at 49.\n\nHetherton's teammate Riley Onley could also be of interest, given he is a 195cm midfielder, a point of difference compared to other mids in the class.\n\nRichmond\n\nPicks 3, 4, 38, 68\n\nThe Tigers are in a tantalising spot courtesy of last year's draft-night trade with North Melbourne netting them a second top-five pick.\n\nSullivan Robey is a late developer whose strength and power in the midfield and forward line have seen him rocket up boards. (Getty Images: Asanka Ratnayake)\n\nRichmond will almost certainly bid on many of the players that are tied to other clubs such as Dylan Patterson, Daniel Annable and Zeke Uwland, should they remain on the board.\n\nIf West Coast doesn't opt for big man Cooper Duff-Tytler, it would be hard to see Richmond pass on him, given his blend of size and athleticism is rare. Otherwise the likes of Sullivan Robey, Sam Cumming and Xavier Taylor will appeal.\n\nThe Tigers also face a decision on whether to use one of their high picks on speedster Sam Grlj, who played for their VFL side late in the year.\n\nSt Kilda\n\nPicks 50, 62, 70\n\nOn paper the Saints do not have much to work with this year, the price of their aggressive spending spree during the trade period.\n\nKye Fincher is a member of the Saints' NGA and will draw a bid at some stage, most likely on night two, and the Saints would be keen to match.\n\nBut there are also whispers the Saints might have something else up their sleeve. Could their 2026 first-round pick be up for grabs if it was to get them a look at a target earlier on night one? And could that player be Jevan Phillipou, brother of Mattaes?\n\nExpect the unexpected when it comes to St Kilda this off-season.\n\nSydney\n\nPicks 31, 32, 42, 60, 71\n\nThe Swans have academy prospect Max King to keep an eye on and he has been tipped to have one of the widest ranges in the draft.\n\nKing could land anywhere as high as pick 20 and as low as the mid-30s, a spot which would be ideal for Sydney.\n\nSydney could also package its first three picks to potentially move into the high teens or low 20s if a player it ranks highly internally falls on draft night.\n\nHalf-back prospect Harry Kyle is also tied to the Swans, as is Lachie Carmichael. It remains to be seen whether all three get to the club.\n\nWest Coast\n\nPicks 1, 2, 13, 34, 41\n\nClubs have shown interest in West Coast's top two selections, but it seems most likely that the Eagles keep them both for themselves on draft night.\n\nCooper Duff-Tytler is a ruck-forward with a unique athletic profile and excellent skills. (Getty Images: Asanka Ratnayake)\n\nWillem Duursma is near enough to a lock to be selected with the top pick, and is a talent worthy of the mantle. At pick two the Eagles have to balance their many list needs \u2014 do they opt for the next-best regarded talent in ruck-forward Cooper Duff-Tytler, or look to belatedly bolster the midfield with Dyson Sharp, Sam Cumming or Sullivan Robey?\n\nMost expect Duff-Tytler to be the Eagles' man with that pick, and though he may be a slower burn his ceiling is sky-high.\n\nThe third first-round pick currently sits at 13, though the Eagles are said to be keen to move that up if they can. If they can't, a punt on injured winger Harley Barker could be of interest, or a more speculative look at Josh Lindsay or Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves.\n\nNGA prospects Tylah Williams and Koby Evans and father-son Charlie Banfield could all receive bids, and ideally the Eagles would see to securing all three.\n\nWestern Bulldogs\n\nPicks 14, 33, 53\n\nThe Bulldogs find themselves in an interesting position within the first round of the draft and are well placed to scoop up a slider or take their pick from a diverse range of prospects.\n\nBig-bodied midfielder Ollie Greeves is a good chance to still be on the board at the Bulldogs' pick, they could look at zippy half-back Oskar Taylor or dynamic mid-forward Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves.\n\nBut given the Bulldogs' well-publicised need for key defensive support, Blake Thredgold should be highly considered if he is available. A tall but athletic full-back, Thredgold would need a couple of years to fill out but is already dominant in the air and combative at ground level.",

What risk does it actually pose?\n\nAccording to the department, the sand has either been secured at a majority of the locations or has been confined to isolated areas.\n\n\"The sand's in a pot, in a bag, it's safe, it's away, and we'll get to those sites and collect that,\" chief executive Martin Westwell told ABC Radio Adelaide.\n\n\"The other sites are sites where perhaps the sand is out, maybe even kind of stuck up on the wall, on artwork or out on a table somewhere, and the advice from SafeWork has been to get asbestos removal contractors to get in and remove that and that's exactly what we're doing.\"\n\nOur Lady of La Vang school at Flinders Park is one of two Catholic Education sites that has temporarily closed. (ABC News: Daniel Taylor)\n\nCatholic Education yesterday said it had temporarily closed two schools in Adelaide to allow for deep cleaning, but Mr Westwell said there was currently no reason for public schools to follow suit.\n\n\"I know that some sites have got particular issues just with the clean-up and how do you get it out of the sites, perhaps if it's spread around a lot, and that might be why some of those other schools are closing, just to help with the clean-up,\" he said.\n\n\" But the risk is incredibly low, and if I thought that it wasn't \u2014 if I thought that the risk was higher and that there was a real challenge for students' health \u2014 I'd close schools, I wouldn't hesitate. \"\n\nTwo Catholic schools remain closed\n\nOn Saturday, the department revealed coloured sand products linked to the contamination scare had been identified at more than 100 sites.\n\nMr Westwell said the growing list of schools that have reported finding the impacted sand products on their premises reflected the number of products themselves, with major retailers joining the ACCC in issuing recalls.\n\nAsked whether there were grounds for \"removing all of this kind of product, no matter what the brand is, given these concerns\", Mr Westwell said that possibility would be looked at.\n\n\"With the recall that we see now I don't think there's going to be much of this \u2026 coloured sand, this play sand, left in our sites anyway,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll certainly have a look at that, but what we're doing at the moment is making sure that we're responding to the advice from the ACCC and SafeWork.\"\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Catholic Education said it had temporarily closed Our Lady of La Vang Special School at Flinders Park and St Patrick's Special School at Dulwich.\n\nSt Patrick's Special School at Dulwich has also closed.

Students, staff and families are unable to re-enter identified learning spaces until this has happened,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"In separate cases in our schools, if there is any loose sand identified, we have made appropriate arrangements to re-locate students safely to other learning spaces while cleaning is undertaken.\"\n\nEducation Minister Blair Boyer said the situation at the two Catholic schools necessitated closure.\n\n\"They've done that because they didn't have space that they could move students \u2014 and special schools can be a bit more complex,\" he said.\n\n\"They didn't have space to move students so that the areas where the sand had been loose could be deep-cleaned.\"\n\nEducation authorities say there is no reason to close public schools, but they are monitoring the situation. (ABC News: Daniel Taylor)\n\nMr Boyer told ABC News Breakfast he was not surprised by the \"high number\" of schools that had reported finding the recalled coloured sand products, given their popularity.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the ACT had implemented broader school closures, Mr Boyer said circumstances were different in South Australia.\n\n\"Although, if there are circumstances where a school needed to be shut to deep-clean to take place, then of course that is what we would do,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there's a real question to be asked here about how this stuff got in in the first place.\"",

        "text": "If nothing else, there is one indisputable truth about the sport of boxing \u2014 it is not a sport that you play.\n\n\"You don't play boxing,\" five-weight world champion Sugar Ray Leonard once said, a sentiment similar to those echoed by countless fighters and pundits before and since.\n\n\"You really don't. You play golf, you play tennis, but you don't play boxing.\"\n\nThe risks are enormous, and the examples of just how catastrophically things can turn inside the squared circle are countless.\n\nIt's why Jake Paul's announced fight against Anthony Joshua is so reckless that foolish doesn't cover it.\n\nEven to call it idiotic is kind.\n\nJake Paul may have bitten off more than he can chew. (Getty Images: Leonardo Fernandez)\n\nThe YouTuber-turned-upstart boxer has announced that he will step into the ring against the 2012 Olympic super heavyweight gold medallist and two-time unified heavyweight champion of the world at the Kaseya Center in Miami on December 19.\n\nBoxing's propensity to plumb the depths of moral ambiguity is not new, and its shady and objectionable quest for ever-larger purses at the expense of genuine sporting merit is a constant-yet-accepted gripe among fans.\n\nBut this has the potential to be another \u2014 largely avoidable \u2014 disaster played out in front of a gore-hungry public who care little for the outcome beyond baying for the sight of blood.\n\nBoxing is dangerous.\n\nMen and women have died in the ring.\n\nEven if dramatic, instant catastrophes are mercifully rare, the well-documented long-term effect of having one's brain pounded by another person's fists in the name of entertainment means that those catastrophic outcomes are almost inevitable one way or another.\n\nJake Paul beat up 58-year-old Mike Tyson in Netflix's first boxing show. (Getty Images: Al Bello)\n\nAs was the fear ahead of Paul's shambolic fight against Mike Tyson \u2014 a fear that was thankfully not realised \u2014 the prospect of serious damage being done is very, very real.\n\nOnly this time, it's Paul in the firing line.\n\nHe alluded to the fact that this was not a game when announcing the fight.\n\n\"This isn't an AI simulation. This is Judgement Day,\" the 28-year-old said.\n\nYet the bravado of a man not entirely sure what he is getting into immediately shone through, perhaps suggesting that he believes he is, in fact, in some kind of glorified show in which he is the undoubted star.\n\n\"When I beat Anthony Joshua, every doubt disappears, and no-one can deny me the opportunity to fight for a world title,\" he said.\n\n\"To all my haters, this is what you wanted.\"\n\nJoshua, without question, marks the toughest opponent of Paul's ring career.\n\nAnthony Joshua is a different calibre of fighter to all of Jake Paul's previous opponents. (Getty Images: Richard Pelham)\n\nA professional record of 28-4, with 25 KOs \u2014 all in the monstrous heavyweight division \u2014 is one thing. A massive, 198-centimetre, musclebound frame and a boxing pedigree built from numerous battles against the world's very best is another.\n\nThe only stipulation is that Joshua must come in at under a catchweight of 245 pounds (111.1 kilograms) \u2014 the first time he has had to fight under a limit in his career.\n\nHe most recently weighed in at 114.3kg for his fight against Daniel Dubois. Paul has never weighed in at more than 103kg for a fight and most often fights under the cruiserweight limit of 90kg.\n\nBoth fighters will wear regulation 10-ounce gloves for the eight, three-minute rounds.\n\nPaul has a pro record of 12-1 with 7 KOs. The pedigree of his opponents is not quite of the same calibre, a collection carefully curated combatants for maximum exposure and minimal risk \u2014 if there is such a thing in boxing.\n\nJake Paul has carefully selected all of his opponents thus far. (Getty Images: Michael Reaves)\n\nYes, on paper, former world champion Tyson posed a formidable opponent. But the uncomfortable sight of the then-58-year-old former baddest man on the planet seemingly struggle to muster the power to punch through a paper bag highlighted a different reality.\n\nAfter Jake Paul mocked Mike Tyson, he uttered four words that nobody wanted to hear Mike Tyson's return to the ring played out exactly as everyone expected as the once-feared baddest man in boxing was reduced to an impotent husk. It's why he cannot be allowed to enter the ring again.\n\nAside from Tyson, Paul's opposition has mostly consisted of out-of-shape MMA fighters and, earlier in his career, woefully under-prepared basketball players.\n\nHis one defeat came against an actual, active boxer-turned reality TV star, Tommy Fury.\n\nBut Joshua is a different kettle of fish.\n\nYes, the 36-year-old is on the inexorable slide towards retirement and has suffered four career-defining defeats in his last six world title bouts, including a devastating defeat against fellow Brit Daniel Dubois 14 months ago.\n\nBut fighting Paul should be beneath him. Stepping into the ring with someone so obviously out of his class will not harm Joshua's considerable ring legacy among the British sporting public \u2014 unless he loses, that is.\n\nDaniel Dubois destroyed Anthony Joshua in their IBF world title fight in September, 2024. (Getty Images: Richard Pelham)\n\nWhich is the biggest issue.\n\nJoshua can't afford to take this lightly. He has to make a statement.\n\nThe Briton's threat to \"break the internet over Jake Paul's face\" is not an idle one.\n\nRising British heavyweight Moses Itauma summed it up succinctly on BBC Sport.\n\n\"He [Paul] just needs to weigh the outcomes,\" said Itauma, who is one of Joshua's training partners.\n\n\"I dunno, 50 million [versus] my health, cars and watches [versus] can't say my name.\n\n\"Is it worth it?\"\n\nFinancially, of course, this will be worth it.\n\nBoth boxers will expect to rake in tens of millions from what will likely be one of the most-watched sporting events of the year and certainly the highest-rated boxing event.\n\nMillions of people watched Jake Paul's fight against Mike Tyson. (Getty Images: Sportsfile/Stephen McCarthy)\n\nSet to be shown on Netflix on December 19, the event will likely achieve similar numbers to the streaming network's first boxing show \u2014 Paul's unsettling bout with the shadow of a man who used to be Tyson.\n\nThat was the most-streamed sporting event in history, peaking at 65 million live concurrent streams and drawing an estimated 108 million average live viewers worldwide.\n\nAs farcical as Paul's victory over Tyson was, the interest shows there is a sizeable market in it, for a sport that sometimes struggles to get the mainstream attention it used to enjoy in its 1980s heyday.\n\nAnd, despite the clear issues with that contest and others he has arranged for himself, Paul has made his mark on the sport in more ways than just fighting.\n\nHis promotion company, Most Valuable Promotions, is the driver behind the blockbuster women's showdowns between Amanda Serrano and Katie Taylor, earning two sporting legends the sort of purse money for their two groundbreaking bouts that their male counterparts regularly command.\n\nJake Paul (centre) has helped give women's boxing a far larger platform than it has previously enjoyed. (Getty Images: Sportsfile/Stephen McCarthy)\n\nA staunch advocate for women's sport, Paul backed out of fighting former lightweight world champion Gervonta Davis \u2014 which was, in itself, a ludicrous proposition anyway based on that fact that the 165cm-tall Davis has a fighting weight of less than 60kg, while Paul would typically weigh in at 90kg \u2014 after Davis was named in a lawsuit by his former partner.\n\nPaul, who described Davis as \"an actual walking human piece of garbage\", said he \"didn't want to give this woman abuser a platform to grow his fans and to grow his bank account\".\n\n\"My company champions women, \" he said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nSo what of this fight?\n\nDangerous. Yes.\n\nFoolhardy? Of course.\n\nCompelling?\n\n\"Is it a bit of a circus? Yeah, absolutely,\" former WBA lightweight champion Anthony Crolla told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I think it's an insane situation.\n\n\"It will be a very dangerous fight.\n\n\"If there were some kind of injuries inflicted on Jake Paul, then there would be a lot of people who would have to answer big questions.\n\n\"Anybody who knows boxing can't allow this to be built up like it's a serious fight.\"\n\nAnd yet \u2026\n\n\"I think it's crazy, but will I watch it? Probably,\" Crolla said.\n\nHe is not alone. The Netflix show will no doubt do enormous numbers and legitimise what should only ever be the wildest fever dream of a fight.\n\nBoxing is not a game.\n\nLet's hope it's not game over.",

(Getty Images: Callista Images)\n\nChrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is the most common type of asbestos and is the main form used commercially.\n\nTremolite is relatively rare, and can be found in mineral talc and vermiculite deposits.\n\n\"It still can form fibres, but typically it's found in non-fibrous forms and it's less likely to form fibres that can be breathed in,\" Dr Musgrave said.\n\n\"The ACCC investigation found that the material that was found in these sands weren't the ones that can be easily lofted into the air and breathed in.\"\n\nWhat is the concern then?\n\nAll types of asbestos can cause mesothelioma and asbestosis.\n\nKadink decorative sand was among the first brands of coloured sand to be recalled. (Supplied: ACCC)\n\n\u201cAll asbestos is hazardous but the amount of hazard is different,\u201d Dr Musgrave said.\n\nAlthough the material detected in the sand is less likely than other forms of asbestos to form fibres, authorities are not taking any chances.\n\n\"The damage caused by asbestos is due to these fibres getting breathed in [and] getting into the cells,\" Dr Musgrave said.\n\n\"Because the cells can't break them down, they generate oxidative stress which can cause damage to the lung and can also result in lung cancer.\"\n\nWhat risk does the coloured sand pose?\n\nAsbestos has not been found in all of the sand that has been analysed, and where it has been found, it has been at trace levels.\n\n\"It's fairly low level and also the material is in a form that it's not easily breathed in,\" Dr Musgrave said.\n\n\"This is a form which doesn't easily form fibres and it's not forming fibres which can be lofted into the air and breathed in by kids.\n\n\" So unless you've got an industrial sand milling machine in your school it's very unlikely that your children will be exposed to fibres that can be breathed in and cause disease. \"\n\nKmart and Target have recalled four coloured sand products over potential asbestos contamination. (Supplied: MBIE)\n\nDr Musgrave said the risk for asbestos-induced disease was related to both how much and how long a person was exposed.\n\n\u201cGiven that this has been discovered recently, it's likely that exposure to this material hasn't been long and because it's the form it doesn't easily form particles you can breathe in, and it's also in trace levels, the exposure levels are quite low,\" he said.\n\n\"So the risk of of any disease from this exposure is also low.\n\n\" It's not zero. There will never be a zero risk. But the risk is very low. \"\n\nDr Musgrave said his advice to parents whose children attend affected schools was \"don't panic\".\n\nWhat's happening in each jurisdiction today?\n\nTwenty-five public schools will remain closed across Canberra today, with another 16 partially closed.\n\nFifty-one ACT schools, which were previously closed, have fully reopened today.\n\nAsbestos removal teams are working to clean up and dispose of coloured sand products in Canberra schools. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nMore than 300 education sites in South Australia have now reported the use of coloured sand that may contain asbestos.\n\nThe Department of Education said licensed asbestos contractors began removing the recalled product from its sites yesterday.\n\nIt said the risk was low and was being managed in line with national standards and advice from SafeWork SA.\n\nMeanwhile, Catholic schools Our Lady of La Vang Special School in Flinders Park and St Patrick's Special School in Dulwich have temporarily closed due to the identification of sand products.\n\nCatholic Education South Australia said a deep clean had been arranged and students, staff and families were unable to re-enter some learning spaces until this had happened.\n\nSix Tasmanian non-government schools are closed today, while another six are partially closed. No public schools are closed.\n\nBut Tasmania's Education Union is calling on the Education Department to consider closing schools.\n\nTwenty-five schools across Canberra are closed today. (ABC News: Mark Moore)\n\nNo schools have been closed in Victoria, although 300 schools and more than 600 early childhood services have been identified as using the recalled products.\n\n\"Schools and early childhood services have been provided with updated guidance, including safe-handling instructions for the craft sand. Government schools have also been provided with advice on how to report products to be collected for disposal.\"\n\nOn Monday, WA Premier Roger Cook confirmed 76 schools in WA had been found with coloured sand products that were recalled.\n\nIn a statement, the Queensland Department of Education said it was working closely with all state schools \"that may be impacted by the coloured sand recall\".\n\n\"We do not anticipate there will be any state school closures this week and all schools are open as normal today. We are working to ensure continuity of education for all students,\" it said.\n\nConcern over lack of uniformity between jurisdictions\n\nThe Asbestos Disease Society of Australia is concerned about the different state and territory responses to potential asbestos exposure.\n\nQueensland parents question asbestos sand dilemma Queensland parents are divided over the nationwide recall of coloured sand that may have traced of asbestos.\n\nSociety head Melita Markey said varied state regulations could create a patchy national response.\n\n\"Different agencies get together and meet and they come up with what they consider to be a good national approach, but then it's all up to the individual states whether they adopt it,\" she said.\n\n\"The federal asbestos eradication agency came out with a strategic plan. Not every state signed on to that immediately and then they could pick or choose what parts they adopted.\"\n\nMs Markey also urged Australia's education sector to be more proactive in identifying and removing other forms of asbestos from schools.\n\n\"We're focusing on something that's very immediate, but what about the long-term effects of children in these ageing, deteriorating schools around Australia \u2014 ageing and deteriorating roofs, putting asbestos fibres through the gutters, washing it down around the grounds,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's start looking at the bigger picture of removing that.\"",

(ABC News: Kylie Gillespie)\n\nThe cut will reduce annual alumina production by about 1.2 million tonnes and impact about 180 jobs at the refinery.\n\nRio Tinto general manager for bauxite and alumina Tim McDougall said the company was not seeking government support for a new tailings development.\n\n\"This decision is about the economic viability of the tailings facility, it is not about government policy and we're very focused on solving that ourselves,\" he said.\n\nRedeployment planning underway\n\nMr McDougall said every effort would be made to find opportunities for people who want to stay in Gladstone, through Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) and Boyne Smelters.\n\n\"We have a long lead time which allows us to work through the changes \u2026 this will give us time to talk with our people, to understand their preferences and manage this change,\" he said.\n\n\"As required, we're also very open to looking at opportunities more broadly in Queensland and also in Australia.\"\n\nRio Tinto's aluminium Pacific operations managing director Armando Torres said the company had investigated whether it could develop a second tailings facility at Yarwun, but it was not economically viable.\n\n\"Reducing production from October 2026 enables us to continue alumina production until 2035 and trial pathways to secure the longer-term future of Yarwun,\" Mr Torres said.\n\n\"It is a difficult but necessary decision that preserves future options for the site and supports continued economic contribution.\"\n\nRio Tinto says it is exploring options to further extend the refinery's life. (Reuters: David Gray)\n\nMr Torres said Rio Tinto remained committed to its alumina and aluminium operations in Gladstone.\n\nThe company said there would be no impact to its customers or other operations, with bauxite mines and aluminium smelters to continue to operate at full capacity.\n\n'I trust they will do the right thing'\n\nGladstone Regional Council Mayor Matt Burnett said the announcement was concerning, but he was hopeful there was a future for the site.\n\n\"If Rio Tinto wanted to close Yarwun early, they would go full steam ahead towards 2031,\" Cr Burnett said.\n\n\" That isn't the case, and they are actively exploring new technologies to keep the facility open and viable. \"\n\nCr Burnett said the company had been a long-term employer in Gladstone.\n\n\"I trust they will do the right thing by the people and workers of Gladstone, who have supported their operations since 1967,\" he said.\n\nAlumina is used as a feedstock in smelters to create aluminium and has a wide range of other industrial uses.\n\nThe Yarwun site currently employs about 725 people and produces about 3 million tonnes of alumina per year.\n\nIt comes less than two months after Rio Tinto announced it would potentially close the Gladstone Power Station six years earlier than expected.",

This is nothing new but is clearly evident in relatively high price to earnings multiples. The forward price to earnings ratio on US shares is at 23.5 times, not far below the 1999-2000 tech boom high. The PE on Australian shares is well above its tech boom high despite a recent fall.\n\n\"And valuations are a poor guide to timing market movements. That said, high PEs and the low equity risk premium compared to much of the last twenty years warn of a slower return potential ahead and provide less of a buffer should things go wrong.\n\n\"Second, shares have had several years of strong gains, with the last bear market in global shares being in 2022. Shares did have sharp falls into April this year on Trump's tariffs, but the falls were less than 20% and were quickly reversed. Over the last 3 years US shares have returned 23%pa, global shares 21%pa and Australian shares 13%pa. History warns that after a run of strong above average years a weaker year and often a bear market can come along.\n\n\"Third, there are signs of a bubble forming in AI shares with investor enthusiasm for AI related exposure. Specifically, the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla) have risen more than 30-fold over the last decade dwarfing various other bubbles and they have disproportionately driven the US share market accounting for 50% or more of its gains since 2023.\"",

I say that there\u2019s a standard that these players with athletic traits...on whatever field, whatever sport you\u2019re in. \u201cLet\u2019s call them A, B, C and D. If you\u2019re E, you don\u2019t help. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Credit: AP \u201cOnce all the players, either are in A, B, C or D category, to me then it\u2019s all intangibles. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re an A athlete, but your intangibles are a C, they usually play to a B or a C.\n\n\u201cIntangibles will help you either meet or exceed your expectation.\u201d Stafford\u2019s career was founded on intangibles, as with many quarterbacks. Players who didn\u2019t fit in with teammates, weren\u2019t team-first, were often shunted. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there, we\u2019re like \u2018I think we ought to kick those guys off the boat, they\u2019re not helping us.\u2019\u201d In his office, Snead mentioned his friend, Sam Walker, whom the Los Angeles Rams employ as a consultant and who had recently been in Melbourne working with Brad Scott and Essendon on leadership. Zach Merrett and Andrew McGrath Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Last summer, Scott, Zach Merrett and Andy McGrath - Merrett\u2019s probable successor as skipper - went to LA to meet with Walker, who specialises in the construction of team ethos and leadership.\n\nEssendon\u2019s cultural issues, exemplified by Merrett\u2019s attempted escape, seemed relevant to another commandment on the wall: \u201cIMMERSE OUR PEOPLE IN THE RAMS WE THEN ME WAY.\u201d \u201cWE\u201d was coloured yellow against blue for emphasis. Here were other striking observations from Snead which hold relevance to the AFL draft (and trading/free agency): 1. Why a gun player can slide in the draft Puka Nacua, a star wide receiver, was drafted at pick No 177, the fifth round of the 2023 draft. Snead said Pacua had been overlooked by all teams in the early rounds because he did not fit the prototype for his position - which was biased to speed.\n\nNacua, too, was injured in his final college year. \u201cIn the draft, let\u2019s call it the higher you get... usually there\u2019s a cleaner profile. That\u2019s just the way the probabilities work. \u201cHis game is strength and power, probably bully ball - catch the ball and I\u2019m now going to have to make you tackle me, and a lot of times that\u2019s devalued in the draft. We\u2019ve seen some of the players that fit that profile, they get devalued, because it\u2019s a spacing game, speed, explosiveness. A young Sam Mitchell Credit: Peter Mathew \u201cThere was a strategy there. And we could probably get him a little later. Now based on all things considered we should have picked him earlier.\u201d The AFL clubs will all be hoping, no matter the odds, of finding their version of Nacua (188 cm and 96 kilograms), who is his sport\u2019s answer to Chris Grant, James Hird, Sam Mitchell, Tom Stewart and others who were bypassed early in the draft. The knock on Mitchell was that he was small and slow.\n\nLoading 2. Which are the hardest players to assess in the draft and why? A simple answer to this one from Snead: Quarterbacks. Why? \u201cNFL\u2019s the highest level of a video game... The game in college is different to the NFL and the quality is not as good....there\u2019s more space. \u201cIn the NFL, there\u2019s hardly any space... Can you, as that QB then, as things [happen], speed up?\n\nIn the AFL, the draft record suggests key forwards are harder to identify than midfielders. Key forwards - and some key backs - don\u2019t necessarily replicate junior success in the AFL. Like quarterbacks, they face congestion in the big league. The Rams traded in Stafford, knowing he was a proven commodity, in the same way that the Swans acquired Curnow, and Tony Lockett, Barry Hall and Lance Franklin before him. When did Sydney last draft a quality key forward? \u201cYou cut out the risk when you trade for quarterback,\u201d said Snead. Charlie Curnow as a Swan. Credit: Eddie Jim 3. Trading in mature players for draft picks when in the premiership window\n\nSnead follows a method similar to AFL clubs who believe you only give up draft capital when entering contention. One factor he mentioned is seldom raised in the AFL - that of the senior coach also being \u201cin his prime\u201d. The LA Rams win the Super Bowl in 2022. Credit: AP \u201cIn the year we won the Super Bowl \u2026 we had a lot of players in their prime. \u201cSo we used like some of our premium draft picks to make trades, to bring in other players in their prime.\n\n\u201cThat might not be the strategy if you\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Stafford was acquired from the Detroit Lions using that formula. \u201cA lot of his teammates were in their prime, the head coach was in his prime. It was like, \u2018OK, if we add a QB in his prime\u2019, now you have, at least on paper, a more complete [team]. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there and you\u2019re getting there, you might be a little bit heavier [in the] draft.\u201d 4. What to do once a team enters \u201cno man\u2019s land?\u201d No man\u2019s land, as defined by a senior AFL club official (to his board) was neither rebuilding, nor contending (nor the half-way house of \u201cbuilding\u201d). Snead, when this was put to him, liked the concept and spoke as if he\u2019d been in that predicament.\n\n\u201cNo man to me is you\u2019ve got to tear it down first. Which is, \u2018oh wow, we have to tear this thing down over two seasons.\u2019 That ought to be fun and I\u2019m sure the fans are going to have trust in us, right? Loading \u201cMine would be, if you\u2019re in no man\u2019s [land], you\u2019ve got to tear it down. That may be you\u2019re a team that\u2019s older, right, and now how to do you move on... I call the rebuilding/building...or I call it remodelling.\u201d Melbourne and Carlton, mired in no man\u2019s land in 2025, would appear to have followed Snead\u2019s formula, to an extent, by trading out Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver and Charlie Curnow, as Tom De Koning walked as a free agent.

        "text": "Loading The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said in a statement that it was \u201cgathering information to establish the facts of the matter and will investigate to assess whether there has been any non-compliance with the Triple Zero rules. If any breaches are identified, appropriate enforcement action will be taken. \u201cPublic safety and reliable access to emergency services are of paramount importance. Under rules introduced in 2024, telecommunications providers must notify their customers where the provider identifies that the customer\u2019s device may not be able to connect to Triple Zero and then take action to block those devices from their networks.\u201d The tragedy comes just two months after three people died during a major Optus outage in mid-September, when more than 600 calls to Triple Zero emergency services failed to connect. That incident, which lasted more than 90 minutes, prompted a federal government inquiry and led to parliament fast-tracking new legislation to strengthen oversight of emergency calling services. The September Optus outage was the second major Triple Zero failure for the telco in two years. In November 2023, more than 2000 calls to emergency services failed to connect during a 12-hour national network outage, resulting in a $12 million fine from ACMA.\n\nThe incidents have shaken public confidence in Australia\u2019s emergency services infrastructure and put intense pressure on both telcos and device manufacturers to ensure Triple Zero access. Communications Minister Anika Wells. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong The watchdog disclosed just last month that some older Samsung mobile phones released between 2015 and 2017 could not automatically switch to alternative networks to complete Triple Zero calls. Testing revealed that 71 Samsung models were affected, with 11 requiring replacement and 60 needing software updates. The problem stems from legacy firmware configurations that attempt to route emergency calls through Vodafone\u2019s now-defunct 3G network. When Telstra and Optus networks are unavailable, these devices cannot successfully switch to TPG\u2019s 4G network as a back-up. Wells last month warned that the Samsung phone problems could be \u201cindicative of a broader systemic issue\u201d in Australia\u2019s telecommunications emergency services.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of devices nationwide that may be affected by the issue. Some 46,000 devices are thought to be affected across Australia\u2019s three major carriers. TPG identified affected devices last year during preparations for the national shutdown of 3G services and blocked them from its network, sharing information with Telstra and Optus. However, Telstra engineers recently discovered during testing that the same Samsung devices were still attempting to connect Triple Zero calls via Vodafone\u2019s decommissioned 3G infrastructure. \u201cWhy this was configured this way is a question for Samsung and Vodafone,\u201d a Telstra spokesman said. Vodafone owner TPG described the issues as related to a \u201clegacy configuration within the devices themselves\u201d. The company identified additional Samsung devices this year requiring software updates, and has been blocking devices that haven\u2019t been upgraded, as required under new regulations. \u201cWhen TPG Telecom became aware of these handsets on its network, we communicated with customers to urgently update affected devices,\u201d the company said on Tuesday morning. \u201cHandsets not updated are blocked after a period of 28 to 35 days from the first contact to the customer, as required under new regulations.\n\n\u201cThe most recent communications to customers with impacted devices was sent on 7 November. These updates are critical to ensure compactibility with emergency services and to protect customer safety.\u201d Under rules that took effect from November 1, telcos must test whether mobile phones can switch to other networks during Triple Zero outages, report failures in real time, and disconnect phone services within 28 to 35 days of notifying customers that their devices cannot connect to emergency services. Loading Parliament last month also passed legislation creating a new Triple Zero Custodian with compliance powers to ensure emergency services remain accessible. The custodian can impose maximum fines of $30 million for breaches of Triple Zero rules \u2013 a tenfold increase from previous penalties. The government has also ordered telcos to create separate public registers of Triple Zero outages, though carriers have raised concerns about the technical and cost challenges of real-time reporting. TPG warned that implementing real-time reporting for unplanned outages would \u201crequire substantial system changes and cost across our operations\u201d.",

        "text": "A back stress injury meant Uwland missed this year\u2019s championships after an outstanding bottom-age campaign last year that had him pegged as the best prospect in the 2025 class. The man viewed as Errol Gulden 2.0 did not reach those heights in the limited football he played after recovering, but his football IQ is as good as anyone\u2019s in this draft. He boasts silky skills and can run all day. Might captain the Suns one day. If not: There has been noise for a while, which heated up during the trade period, that the Eagles might bid on Carlton father-son defender Harry Dean. They could also opt to bid on Dylan Patterson or Daniel Annable here. This is not what the Blues were hoping, but the Eagles look poised to do it. Dean is widely rated as a top-five talent. He is one of the best key defender prospects in years, and stands out because there is a major shortage of that position in this crop. He aggressively flies for marks and spoils, reads the ball superbly, and has the athleticism, composure and skills to thrive at the top level.\n\nIf not: West Coast bid on Dylan Patterson instead, or stopped bidding and went for Cooper Duff-Tytler instead. The Eagles have long been linked to Duff-Tytler, a talented ex-basketballer who boasts similar traits to AFL ruck stars Luke Jackson and Tom De Koning with his athleticism, leap, agility and follow-up work. He showed in a VFL appearance for Essendon, where he played predominantly as a forward, that he can impact the game in attack as well, even if that remains a query in some quarters. Should develop rapidly in an AFL environment. If not: There is talk that Essendon would love to try to snatch West Coast\u2019s No.2 pick after securing Carlton\u2019s No.9, but the likeliest scenario is Duff-Tytler is heading west.\n\nPatterson might be the most damaging and exciting player in this year\u2019s draft. He takes the game on with his kicking and fast feet \u2013 including a nasty goose step \u2013 and sometimes tries to do too much, but showed in a VFL game against Carlton late in the season that he can rein his attacking nature in. Likened to Andrew McLeod, Patterson rejected NRL clubs\u2019 overtures to stay on the AFL path, and could be a difference-maker for the Suns. If not: It seems West Coast will bid on Dean after Uwland. That means the Tigers will bid on Patterson, and that is now expected to be before they pick an unattached player, but maybe they make a live pick first. The Lions\u2019 premiership window will never shut if kids like Annable keep popping up, after the Ashcroft brothers arrived in recent years. Annable racks up disposals, excels at stoppages and is creative by hand. There are all sorts of flattering comparisons ahead of the draft each year, and recruiters see a bit of Simon Black in Annable. Brisbane will gleefully match any bid on Annable, and would quietly be chuffed if it comes this late. If not: The Tigers picked an unattached player first, such as Sam Cumming, Sullivan Robey or Xavier Taylor.\n\nThe consensus view is that the Tigers would not have flown to Mildura just to do their due diligence on Cumming, so expect him to head to Punt Road. A shoulder injury cut his season short, but not before he stamped himself as a top-10 pick. He is a dual-position threat who impacts the game as a deep forward with his marking ability and knack for kicking goals, or as a midfielder, where his physicality, aggression and dynamism are all ticks. There have even been Mark Ricciuto comparisons. Recruiters also like Cumming\u2019s defensive commitment. If not: Richmond went for Sullivan Robey or Xavier Taylor instead. Two of the three should be in yellow and black. Robey is this year\u2019s bolter, after many clubs hoped they could keep him a secret once he graduated from Rowville\u2019s senior side to belatedly burst onto the scene for the Ranges mid-season. He grew about 17 centimetres in the past two years and developed physically, in equal parts owing to an impressive home gym and his dedication. First made his mark as a lead-up forward, then showed his strength and power as a midfielder.\n\nIf not: The Tigers are also strongly linked to Xavier Taylor and Sam Cumming, but are not expected to consider Sam Grlj here. Taylor once polarised because of inconsistent decision-making and execution, including a habit for kicking into the man on the mark \u2013 but he has cleaned that up (mostly), and risen sharply on draft boards. Was best afield in the Ranges\u2019 grand final triumph, where his intercepting skills, athleticism, versatility and competitiveness were on show. Importantly, there is confidence Taylor will stand up defensively in the AFL. If not: Richmond picked Taylor over Sam Cumming or, more likely, Sullivan Robey, meaning one of those latter two slipped through to the Bombers.\n\nThe suspicion is the Bombers will invest in at least one midfielder after parting with Dylan Shiel, Will Setterfield and Ben Hobbs, on top of the Zach Merrett situation, Darcy Parish\u2019s injury history, and with Elijah Tsatas still proving himself. Sharp won the Larke Medal as the best-performed player at the championships, and is a physical, competitive onballer who wins the ball in big doses. If not: Essendon have also been linked to Sullivan Robey, Sam Cumming, Jacob Farrow, Lachy Dovaston and forward-ruck Aidan Schubert. One different move changes a lot of what comes next. The Demons are never afraid to go against the grain, but this may depend on whether Sam Cumming or Xavier Taylor are available. This is higher than Nairn has been projected, but Melbourne have him in their sights. Nairn had a seven-goal game at the championships before demonstrating his ball-winning wares with consecutive 30-plus-disposal outings to end the season. He is a high-IQ footballer, runs all day on the wing, could develop into an inside midfielder, marks well overhead and is a neat kick. If not: They would love Sam Cumming, Sullivan Robey or Xavier Taylor to still be on the board. Melbourne might select defender Jacob Farrow, or one of small forwards Latrelle Pickett or Lachy Dovaston.\n\nFarrow\u2019s draft range starts at Essendon\u2019s picks, and he has admirers into the mid-teens, but he should be long gone by then. He is one of the best kicks in this class \u2013 which should appeal to Melbourne \u2013 makes quick decisions, impacts the game as an interceptor, and showed his agility in combine testing. Farrow has also performed well in the midfield, but is more proven down back, where he will start and possibly stay in the AFL. If not: Small forwards Latrelle Pickett \u2013 cousin of Demon Kysaiah \u2013 or Lachy Dovaston may be considered instead, or they could look to fortify their key defensive posts for the future with Blake Thredgold. Dovaston, who hails from the same Talent League club as Nick Watson, is the best small forward in this draft. He might lack Watson\u2019s tricks, but still has his share, and has greater running capacity and is considered superior defensively to when the star Hawk was the same age. Dovaston kicks goals for fun (and lots of them), is consistent, has become more selfless, runs hard up and down the ground, and tested brilliantly at the combine.\n\nIf not: Essendon might go for another small forward, Latrelle Pickett, instead or add forward-ruck Aidan Schubert, who has been linked to Tullamarine throughout the year. Josh Lindsay and Sam Grlj are other options. The Hawks have interviewed Taylor in recent days, so he is at least in their mix. His stocks increased the longer the year went after not playing at the championships, capped by his eye-catching results at the combine, where he set the fastest 20-metre sprint time and finished second for agility. Taylor puts that acceleration to great use to quickly create separation and get the ball moving forward. He can tidy up his kicking and improve defensively. If not: Hawthorn might opt for speedster Sam Grlj or sweet-kicking defender Josh Lindsay instead.\n\nThredgold has been linked to North Melbourne for a while, so he might be the player they have in mind, assuming they secure Carlton\u2019s selection. Recruiters took notice of Thredgold\u2019s solid job last year as a bottom-ager on future Collingwood forward Charlie West. He also quelled fellow first-round prospect Mitch Marsh in this year\u2019s SANFL under-18 grand final and dominated in the air to cap a strong finals series. He is a tad undersized but a genuine lockdown defender who is strong, athletic and competitive. If not: The Roos might opt for forward-ruck Aidan Schubert, or whoever is still up for grabs between small forwards Lachy Dovaston or Latrelle Pickett. As always with bids, there is a great unknown, but there is enough noise about the Giants potentially bidding, after the Swans bid on Harry Rowston around this range three years ago. The Swans academy product finished top 10 in three tests at the combine, including winning the running vertical jump. Part of Kyle\u2019s appeal is that this was his first year in the academy, so there is serious scope for improvement. He is a good size, has a big tank and brings positional versatility. If not: GWS will probably select from a group including Oskar Taylor, Sam Grlj or Latrelle Pickett, but they are typically tough to predict.\n\nMelbourne star Kysaiah Pickett\u2019s cousin has top-20 interest in what is an even crop, but there is a chance he is still up for grabs in the 20s. The Demons, Essendon and North Melbourne are other possible landing points. Pickett turns 20 in December, so he is slightly older than his draft peers, but has impressed this year with his progress at Glenelg. He is quick, elusive, capable of the mercurial, and has the cheek that the best small forwards possess. If not: GWS might have the option of Oskar Taylor or Sam Grlj, both of whom they also like. West Coast are expected to make a bid on Murray, who has been mentioned in top-20 calculations in recent weeks. But the Suns rate him highly and it would be a shock if they did not match a bid on him here. A foot injury meant Murray did not play at the championships, but recruiters like his athleticism and toughness, and were impressed with how diligent he was with his rehab.\n\nIf not: The Eagles may bid on another Gold Coast academy player, Beau Addinsall. They would be doing so knowing the Suns are less likely to match a bid on Addinsall.\n\nGrlj was originally linked to Richmond, and could easily land at the Hawks or GWS. He would be difficult to pass up for the Eagles if he is still available. Grlj has speed to burn and was one of only two players to run the two-kilometre time trial quicker than six minutes at the combine. He entered top-five calculations with a superb start to the year before hitting a rough patch, but his VFL form for Richmond was excellent. Grlj could eventually become a midfielder, but will likely start at half-back. If not: There is chatter in the industry that Gold Coast academy midfielder Beau Addinsall might attract a bid in the teens, and clubs believe the only club likely to do that would be West Coast. Lindsay is an excellent decision-maker and arguably the best kick in the draft \u2013 the result of years of dedication honing his skills, including a strict morning routine \u2013 so this would be a good result for the Bulldogs. He has been a consistently high performer at all levels, and is viewed as a safe selection who could slot straight into a defensive role. There are varying opinions on whether Lindsay could develop into a midfielder.\n\nIf not: Sydney academy defender Lachy Carmichael is right in the frame here, and several clubs have him pencilled in as the Dogs\u2019 selection. The Swans might not match this early if that eventuates. Adelaide are tipped to go local, and they have kept in close touch with Marsh, who kicked the most goals at the 2025 championships. He emerged from the carnival as a top-10 contender who some thought could play other positions, but appears to have slid after a so-so end to the season. But the talent and upside are there, and Marsh would complement the likes of Riley Thilthorpe and Darcy Fogarty as a different attacking option. If not: There will be other viable South Australian players available, such as Harley Barker, Aidan Schubert and Jevan Phillipou.\n\nInjuries impacted the start of Ison\u2019s season, but the Blues\u2019 next-generation academy prospect finished strongly \u2013 and opposition recruiters took notice. Ison\u2019s height and aerial prowess make him a candidate to fill various roles across the ground, beyond just the midfield. There is still a smallish sample size on him, but the scouting report acknowledges that he can do things others in this range cannot, so Carlton will gleefully match a bid. If not: A bid on Ison might come later, with Fremantle a possibility. If the Cats don\u2019t bid on Ison, they may bid on Gold Coast\u2019s Beau Addinsall, and would be a good chance to get him. Archie Ludowyke has also been linked. Ludowyke started the year brightly for the Dragons and the AFL Academy after long being rated the best key forward in this class. However, he had a goalless championships \u2013 which was not all his fault, as a player relying on service \u2013 before suffering a season-ending PCL injury in Metro\u2019s win over the Allies. This would be a classic Cats play to invest in a player with good size and athleticism who launches himself at the Sherrin. If not: There is a scenario where Geelong Falcons defender Josh Lindsay is available here, while key forward Aidan Schubert is another potential option.\n\nSome clubs think this is too early for Williams, but if anyone makes a bid, the Dockers loom as the most likely for the speedy forward. He has all the traits to be a successful small forward at AFL level, but there is some projection here. Williams starred at the combine, placing second with a scintillating 2.89-second 20-metre sprint and also finished fourth in the agility test. If not: Williams may still be available into the 30s. The Dockers could bid on others, or look for a different forward. Freo are raised as a potential bidder here, and Sweid will probably receive a bid in the 20s somewhere. He recovered well from an ACL rupture that sidelined him for much of the 2024 season, and the Essendon next-generation academy prospect enjoyed a strong campaign. He is small, but that did not stop him at any of the levels he played at this year. Sweid\u2019s toughness, competitiveness, defensive commitment, and penchant for kicking goals while playing at half-forward endeared him to scouts.\n\nIf not: Sweid\u2019s wait will continue. The Dockers might bid on someone like Beau Addinsall or Max King instead.\n\nThere is risk with Barker, who sustained an ACL rupture playing for Sturt after earning All-Australian honours. If a club is willing to take that on board, there is so much to like about Barker\u2019s prospects, given he was considered a top-10 smokey after his championships performance. His size, speed, endurance and skill add up to an impressive package, and he uses his running ability to get involved at both ends. There is a chance he slides. If not: The whispers around the Dockers are that they are interested in a forward, so they might even bid on Max King or could go for Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves, and might even go for a mature-ager. Jevan Phillipou might be another option. Greeves is linked to the Hawks by virtue of their rejected application to include him in their next-generation academy program because of his Indigenous background. He also trained with them during the pre-season through the AFL Academy. Greeves is polarising \u2013 with most queries centred on his running ability \u2013 but a contested beast who has the height and ability to also impact the game when he plays as a marking forward.\n\nIf not: Hawthorn might opt for more firepower in attack, with someone such as Aidan Schubert or Liam Hetherton, who has also been linked to them. Could they place a bid on Beau Addinsall? The Bombers might snap up Schubert with one of their early picks, or North may already have drafted him with the pick they are expected to trade for from Carlton. His awkward ball drop and kicking style are talking points, and put some clubs off, while he measured shorter than some scouts expected. But Schubert had an outstanding championships to surge into the top-10 mix. Talls can sometimes drift, given the risks involved, but his competitiveness and endurance appeal. If not: Winger Harley Barker is a player of interest and would be in strong consideration if he is available. Forward-ruck Louis Emmett is another option.\n\nIn a draft where many prospects are flawed or erratic, Carmichael\u2019s ultra-consistency across several years is a big tick. The Dogs might even bid for him with their first pick, where they would have a strong chance of retaining him. Carmichael was an All-Australian at under-16 level in 2023, and earned that same honour at this year\u2019s under-18 championships, where he was also the Allies\u2019 MVP. Carmichael is defensively sound, but his kicking and relative lack of athleticism may keep him in this range. If not: The Dogs might only bid on Carmichael with their first pick. If they don\u2019t bid on him, they will likely go for a taller option instead. It becomes really difficult to know what will happen this deep into the draft, but the Bulldogs are linked to him and another athletic ruckman, Marcus Krasnadamskis. The popular view on Emmett, who finished third in the time trial at the combine, is that he will need to develop into a key-position player at either end \u2013 but there is upside here, and he will be a back-up ruck option at worst. His draft range starts earlier than this but could be wider.",

        "text": "Before that series, Labuschagne had been full of brio when discussing how he knew exactly what was needed to deal with every member of England\u2019s then bowling attack. It\u2019s a level of confidence he lost somewhere along the way over six years of constant international cricket, but it\u2019s back now. \u201c[In 2019] I was averaging 60 in county cricket and just in that run scoring form when everything\u2019s clear. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re facing, it\u2019s just \u2018ok I\u2019ll do this, or this, or this is where they\u2019re bowling and I\u2019ll put them under pressure here\u2019. Jofra Archer. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWhen you\u2019re not going well it\u2019s the opposite, it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ve got to do this, I\u2019ve got to defend and grind\u2019, instead of \u2018nah I\u2019ll just play the ball like that because that\u2019s where the field or the plan is\u2019. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re not doing well or failing, there\u2019s doubt, I don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s what happens. But I think it was more the fact that my technique was in a space where I couldn\u2019t apply pressure to the opposition, so my only option was defensively to grind. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s shifted and why I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nLoading Alongside those memories of 2019 is a remarkable admission - through much of the rich run of scoring that followed for Australia, Labuschagne does not think he was playing particularly well. \u201cI\u2019ve had periods of being a prolific run scorer, the 2019-20 Pakistan, New Zealand summer here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even then I don\u2019t think I was necessarily batting that good. I was just a good decision-maker and I was in a rhythm of scoring runs, so you\u2019re able to repeat that consistently.\u201d Labuschagne does not yet know whether he is going to bat in his customary number three spot or shift back up to opening with Usman Khawaja, saying: \u201cit\u2019s not as simple as work out your one, two, three\u201d. But he does know he will be batting far better than last summer, where at times he both looked and felt like a sitting duck. \u201cMy technique\u2019s in a spot now where I can score off more deliveries and now it\u2019s about decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cI was nowhere near my best last summer, but I still managed to play some crucial innings in a series. But it\u2019s certainly not the way I want to be playing, as restricted as I was then.\n\nLoading \u201cWhen you get that space, you sit back and go, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t want to be going back to that, playing that type of cricket where I\u2019m so restricted and feel like the only way is to grind\u2019. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen this season so far, probably a different Marnus than you have in the last few years.\u201d Labuschagne spoke glowingly of Joe Root, calling him \u201cthe best batter in the world at the moment\u201d. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t see the best of Joe Root this summer, for Australia if we can keep him quiet and put him under pressure to score runs that\u2019d be really good for us. But the reality is he\u2019s a class player and the best batter in the world at the moment. The way he goes about it, he\u2019s one of the greats.\u201d But the Queenslander\u2019s own return to the Australian top six provides another warning to England, by showing how much batting in these conditions can be required to feel at home again.\n\n\u201cThe month I had in the West Indies with [Matt] Wadey and Diva [Michael Di Venuto], working there and with Ron [Andrew McDonald] and just batting and not having any pressure on me was the start of the process of getting back,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnically, I hadn\u2019t landed on what I needed to land on then, but it felt like I was getting back to that freedom, and I just wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if I was in the team. As that progressed into coming here, I thought the only way I\u2019m going to get back to playing my best is if I just played games. Loading \u201cSo I played four or five club T20 games to get out there and bat and be able to find that feeling of scoring runs. I played two practice games against Tasmania, and it was the same thing, building up scoring runs in the middle and getting that feeling of trusting my game.\u201d England have played one measly warm-up game and on Tuesday will have their first session in the fast Perth Stadium nets.",

The joke that preceded the punchline was the first Trump presidency. Scaramucci became White House communications director in July 2017, and infamously lasted just 11 days in an episode that would come to symbolise the chaos and dysfunction that plagued Trump\u2019s Washington. The whole thing began to unravel when Scaramucci phoned The New Yorker\u2019s Washington correspondent, Ryan Lizza, and launched into a lengthy, profanity-laden tirade that involved some extremely colourful editorialising about a couple of his White House colleagues. Scaramucci insisted the conversation was off the record. Lizza, and The New Yorker, said it was not, and duly hit publish. Five days later, the Mooch was fired. There has never been a shorter-serving communications director. Anthony Scaramucci, as the director of communications for the White House, during a press briefing in July, 2017.

Mercifully, our breakfast is entirely on the record, and the Mooch seems in a trusting enough mood. The conversation is made easier by the fact that these days, Scaramucci, 61, has no trouble telling the world how he really feels about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re inside Trump\u2019s near orbit you hate his guts. Don\u2019t forget that,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s [Trump] in it for the money and he\u2019s in it for the attention. He\u2019s not in it to serve the American people or to make the country better. He\u2019s into punishing people. He believes in humiliation rituals, particularly for our allies.\u201d When Trump gave Prime Minister Anthony Albanese the cold shoulder for months, there were widespread fears Australia would be subject to such a humiliation ritual. Instead, Scaramucci says, the prime minister and ambassador Kevin Rudd played the Trump game well. US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in October.

Along the way, he crossed paths with Trump, another quintessential \u201cNew Yawker\u201d, and the pair had known each other for two decades before the 2016 election. \u201cYou can never say that you\u2019re friends with Donald Trump because then you\u2019re overstating the relationship.

Scaramucci describes himself as a lifelong Republican with a lower-case \u201cr\u201d (he believes in things like same-sex marriage and women\u2019s reproductive rights, and is envious of Australia\u2019s gun control regime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, the Mooch had been a little politically flirtatious, supporting Obama in 2008, Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, and working on the doomed campaign of Republican frontrunner Jeb Bush in the 2016 primaries. When Bush dropped out, Scaramucci joined the Trump campaign. \u201cI made a decision to go work for Donald Trump, which was a combination of ego-based decision-making and moral equivocation,\u201d Scaramucci says. Michael Douglas as Gordon Gecko in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. The Mooch had a brief cameo in the 2010 movie. It was, the Mooch says, a big mistake. But it\u2019s a mistake that has made him famous. Trump\u2019s celebrity is radioactive. The MAGA-verse is full of people who owe money, power and influence to their decision to kiss the presidential ass. Similarly, there is a thriving cottage industry of Republican rebels, whose excoriating of their old party, coupled with insider-ish commentary on the Trump circus, has found a vast audience among liberal types equal parts fascinated and repulsed by the binfire in the Oval Office. Legend has it that Scaramucci once paid $US100,000 for a brief cameo in Oliver Stone\u2019s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Trump has given the Mooch far more fame than 15 seconds in a middling 2010 sequel ever could.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The United Kingdom government has announced sweeping changes to its asylum system, including drastically cutting protections for refugees and threatening visa bans for countries that refuse to take back irregular immigrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nUK home secretary Shabana Mahmood said on Tuesday she hopes the reforms, modelled on Denmark's strict asylum system, will discourage migrants from crossing the Channel from France on small boats.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefugee status will become temporary and will be reviewed every 30 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefugees will be forced to return to their home countries once those are deemed safe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also need to wait for 20 years, instead of the current five, before they can apply for permanent residency.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE UK Labour strips asylum seeker rights amid surging support for Nigel Farage's Reform party\n\n\"We are obliged to offer sanctuary to those who would be in danger if they returned to their country of origin. However, should the regime change in their home country, our approach should change too,\" the government said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut charities and politicians from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour party slammed the plans, arguing that it could result in uprooting refugees who settle in Britain.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Vaughan, a Labour politician and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticise the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage \"the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 per cent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its European Union peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain. Most migrants arrive legally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government said children as well as adults could also be forcibly removed under the new measures and that it would launch a consultation on the subject.\n\n\n\nAsylum seeker support\n\nThe government said it will end a legal duty to provide support to asylum seekers and refugees who face destitution if they have the means to support themselves or if they break the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 39,000 people, many fleeing conflict, have arrived on small boats this year \u2014 more than for the whole of 2024 but lower than the record set in 2022, when the Conservatives were in power.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of March 2025, over 106,000 asylum seekers received government support.\n\n\n\nFewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its European Union peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain. Most migrants arrive legally. Source: Getty / Dan Kitwood Home Office minister Alex Norris denied media reports that asylum seekers could have their jewellery confiscated to fund their stays.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has also said it will legislate to make it harder for irregular migrants and foreign criminals to use the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to stop deportation.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from \"using dubious connections to stay in the UK\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture. It argued that the \"definition of 'inhuman and degrading treatment' has expanded beyond what is reasonable\", making it too easy to challenge deportations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government also said it would take a \"far more hard-headed approach\" to removing people, including families, who had their claim for asylum refused.\n\n\n\nVisa bans\n\nEchoing United States President Donald Trump's travel bans restricting nationals from certain countries, the interior ministry threatened to stop granting visas to nationals from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless the countries accepted the returns of \"their criminals and illegal immigrants\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNorris told the UK's Sky News the countries had \"one month to get this in order\", adding there were around 4,000 nationals who could be deported.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther countries could be targeted, including with an \"emergency brake\" on visas for people from countries with high rates of asylum claims, who travel to the UK by legal routes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the number of initial positive decisions the UK authorities granted fell from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\n\nReactions\n\nThe tougher stance has been seen as an attempt to claw back support from the hard-right Reform UK party, which has surged in popularity on the back of public anger over immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\nReform's firebrand leader Nigel Farage celebrated the announcements, saying Mahmood \"sounds like a Reform supporter\".\n\n\n\nReform UK leader said UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood \"sounds like a Reform supporter\" over the proposed changes. Source: AAP / PA / Stefan Rousseau Kemi Badenoch, leader of the centre-right opposition Conservatives, said the proposed measures were \"steps in the right direction\" but did not go far enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, urged the government to reconsider, warning the plans \"will not deter\" crossings and refugees who work hard should be able to build \"secure, settled lives\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSile Reynolds, head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would \"punish people who've already lost everything\", adding this is \"not who we are as a country\".\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Gold fever has gripped Australia in recent times, with scenes of queues outside stores as some, banking on continued momentum, bought up while others looked to liquidate amid the record prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for others like Ekjot Kaur, gold isn't about chasing the market \u2014 it's about safeguarding what matters.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaur is quietly packing her jewellery \u2014 a collection of gold bangles, a necklace and a few small keepsakes gifted by her parents at her wedding \u2014 into a parcel bound for \"home\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe isn't packing it for selling or gifting. She is sending it back to India because she no longer feels confident storing it at her home in south-east Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing stories of burglaries circulating through community WhatsApp groups and watching gold prices climb, the 27-year-old said the anxiety became too much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just fear,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the weariness of imagining what could happen every time I leave the house. I don't want to worry about losing a piece of my family's history. I'd rather it sit safely with my parents, where it belongs, than lose it forever.\"\n\n\n\nMelbourne-based jeweller Harshudeep Singh said many of his customers continue the practice of storing their jewellery in bank lockers or family homes in India, even though they buy it in Australia. Source: Supplied According to a Melbourne-based jeweller, Harshudeep Singh, Kaur reflects an existing practice among Indian Australian families.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said many of his clients have long been sending gold jewellery to India, often through trusted relatives or friends, a trend that he said has been further driven by an increase in thefts and burglaries in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People aren't liquidating \u2014 they're safeguarding,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They see their family vault in India as safer than stowing away gold in obscure corners of the house. Even if they purchase here or in India, they prefer to keep that jewellery with their parents in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And this trend is not limited to Australia. It's the same story everywhere for migrant families, be it in the United Kingdom or Canada.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith working parents and school-going children leaving some homes unoccupied for most of the day, a family vault in India \u2014 guarded by relatives \u2014 is often viewed as more secure than a home safe in Australia.\n\n\n\nGold as culture, not commodity\n\nThe price of gold has surged in recent times , driven by inflation and geopolitical tensions. Although that growth has since cooled somewhat , prices remain well above levels seen at the start of the year \u2014 prompting some people to rethink where they store their valuable assets\n\n\n\n\n\nThe yellow metal has always held deep significance in Indian families \u2014 gifted at weddings, inherited by daughters, and stored as a safety net for hard times. Even abroad, those traditions endure.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeena Chavan, an economic anthropologist and associate professor of international business and entrepreneurship at Macquarie Business School, said for Indian Australian families, gold isn't just a financial asset, it's an emotional and cultural inheritance that \"embodies stability, heritage, and belonging\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"India consistently ranks as one of the world's largest gold consumers, responsible for around 25 per cent of global demand. This is primarily driven by a love for gold jewellery, which is an essential part of Indian weddings, festivals, and religious ceremonies,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said for some, sending gold \"home\" is about more than economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It reflects deep trust in family networks and cultural continuity. It's not only about financial security but emotional security, anchoring wealth within family ties and the social fabric of the homeland. For many, it represents confidence in kinship rather than in formal systems,\" Chavan said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian families could be sitting on a goldmine, but many are torn about selling\n\nBut for others, there can be a darker side when it comes to gold.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupriya Singh is an adjunct professor at the Department of Social Inquiry at La Trobe University and a founding member of the Multicultural Women's Alliance Against Family Violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said for some families, the jewellery that represents security and heritage can quietly become a means of exerting power over them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my research on family violence among Indian women in Australia, a sign of economic abuse is that the woman's gold is taken away by the husband or his family,\" Singh told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Often she is told the gold will be kept safely in her mother-in-law's or brother-in-law's safe-deposit locker, to which the woman has no access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Women also tell that the husband stole her jewellery as he left home because of an intervention order. Getting the jewellery back is nearly always impossible. The woman not only loses in terms of wealth, but also loses jewellery which has been handed down her mother's line for generations.\"\n\n\n\nJewellery theft\n\nAccording to the latest Crime Statistics Agency Victoria (CSA) data, jewellery remains the second-highest priority target for thieves in Victoria, led only by cash.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween March 2024 and 2025, nearly $29 million worth of jewellery was reported stolen from Victorian properties. The hardest-hit area was Boroondara in Melbourne's inner-east, with $3.3 million stolen, followed by nearby suburbs such as Hawthorn, Balwyn North, and Kew.\n\n\n\nNearly $29 million worth of jewellery was reported stolen from Victorian properties in the year to June 2025, according to data from the Victorian Crime Statistics Agency. Source: SBS News CSA data shows there were 30,545 burglaries of Victorian homes in the year to June 2025, up 13.9 per cent from 26,812 the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Victoria Police spokesperson told the Herald Sun in July that simple security measures could prevent most burglaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since the start of the year, around 65 per cent of all aggravated home burglaries in key hotspots have either been due to unlocked doors/windows, or an unsuccessful attempt when the offender realised the home was locked,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than $55 million worth of jewellery was stolen from Victorian homes in 2017, but CSA data shows the figure has declined steadily since \u2014 although valuables of this kind remain a consistent target.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimreet Thukral, a Melbourne resident, had $8,000 worth of gold jewellery stolen from her home while on a trip to Adelaide in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of it was heirloom, passed down through generations,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nMelburnian Simreet Thukral had gold and diamond jewellery worth $8,000 stolen from her former home in Noble Park in south-east Melbourne when she went on a trip to Adelaide. Source: Supplied Despite filing a police report, the pieces were never recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The emotional loss was heavier than the monetary one. It's terrifying to think our most precious possessions could just vanish,\" Thukral said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stories like Thukral's are prompting some people to reconsider where they store gold, not all Indian Australian families want their jewellery stored an ocean away.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney resident Sanil (who requested his last name be withheld) said he doesn't identify with the concept of sending or storing gold in India. The 38-year-old said he would rather invest in a private vault and upgrade his home security.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor him, the question is simple: what's the point of owning jewellery you can't wear?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'd rather secure it here than send it somewhere we can't access it for weddings, festivals, or celebrations,\" he told SBS News. \"Gold is meant to be worn, not hidden or stored for posterity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCoburg-based jeweller Harshudeep Singh said moving gold across borders also requires attention to customs duties and declaration rules, particularly for larger quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you send jewellery to India through courier companies or similar means, you will have to pay taxes and duties, which is quite a costly affair,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEkjot Kaur said sending her gold jewellery to her family in India is about protecting a tangible connection to her roots and cultural heritage. Source: Supplied But for some, like Kaur, the reassurance of family custody outweighs the logistical hurdles. She said sending her gold home isn't about distrusting Australia \u2014 it is about protecting a tangible connection to her family and her roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My jewellery is more than wealth. It's memory, it's love, it's the story of who we are. Losing it would feel like losing a part of myself,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Distance makes me feel safer.\"\n\n\n\nFinancial and regulatory considerations\n\nAccording to Chavan, the mindset reflects more than security concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is part of a broader pattern of diaspora wealth management where emotional and financial rationalities intertwine. First-generation migrants often maintain assets in both countries, while younger generations tend to be more globally diversified, treating wealth less as tradition and more as a strategy,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia allows limited quantities of gold to be brought in duty-free, but tighter reporting rules mean families prefer small, discreet transfers rather than large shipments.\n\n\n\nProfessor Santosh Jatrana (not pictured) from the Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation said factors such as the cost of storage and insurance can play a major role in the decision to transfer gold within migrant communities. Credit: Hindustan Times via Getty Images Professor Santosh Jatrana from the Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation said policy factors also play a major role in the decisions related to the transfer of gold within migrant communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Australia, the limited availability of bank safe-deposit services and high fees for private vaults make secure storage both costly and inconvenient,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For instance, annual locker rent in India ranges from about 1,500 rupees to 12,000 rupees, depending on size, location and the bank, which works out to roughly $26 to $207 each year \u2014 a sum many find affordable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJatrana said insurance policies could also affect these decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A standard home insurance provides minimal coverage for high-value jewellery unless each item is specifically listed and valued, making overseas safekeeping comparatively easier.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Sussan Ley has told SBS News she is confident she has the numbers to remain as leader of the Opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked directly in an interview with SBS News about her ability to command a majority inside the Liberal party room Ley said: \"Yes\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe went on to say the deal between the Liberals and Nationals to dump net zero and settle on a new energy policy was evidence of support for her leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The support that we all gave to this plan just yesterday was a demonstration of our unity of purpose when it comes to something that is vital for every single Australian, energy is the economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Ley supporters, moderates Anne Ruston and Maria Kovacic, on Monday disputed media reports suggesting slippage in support for Ley among members of her faction.\n\n\n\nThe Australian newspaper had reported growing momentum among conservative and moderate MPs to pull support from Ley and back conservative Andrew Hastie, who quit the Coalition frontbench last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Media reports this morning about the moderates are incorrect. We, along with an overwhelming majority of our moderate colleagues, continue to strongly support Sussan's leadership,\" a joint statement from Ruston and Kovacic said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This matter was resolved in the party room six months ago and Sussan will lead us strongly to the next election.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ley\u2019s decision to align with The Nationals, ditch net zero and leave the door open to future taxpayer investment in coal-fired power stations has led to rumblings among some moderates about her future.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if she retains the support of other members of her party room, Ley told SBS News she declined to respond to \"commentary about commentary\".\n\n\n\n\"I'm just not going to be distracted for one single moment from my sole focus, which is talking to Australians about the need for affordable energy,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whatever happens inside the Canberra bubble in the commentary and speculation of some reports ... I just don't focus on that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLey was elected Opposition leader with 29 votes, but 25 members of her party room voted against her.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter she secured the top job, conservative leadership aspirants appeared unlikely to challenge in the short term, particularly given she was elevated as the first woman to lead the party.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal party room gathered in Canberra for the net zero debate last week and there was no challenge then either.\n\n\n\nLey '100 per cent committed' to ditching net zero\n\nLey and National Party leader David Littleproud unveiled the Coalition\u2019s climate and energy policy on Sunday following joint party room talks, touting a platform that prioritises \"affordable energy and responsible emissions reduction\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid mounting internal pressure over emissions reduction targets and swirling questions over Ley\u2019s grip on the leadership, the Liberal Party followed its junior Coalition partner last week in dropping its commitment to net zero by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberals instead propose backing coal and gas projects with the aim of bringing down power bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the party says it will pursue year-on-year emissions reductions, but will scrap Labor\u2019s legislated targets.\n\n\n\nAsked if she personally supports ditching net zero in its entirety, Ley told SBS News she was: \"100 per cent committed to the plan that I'm talking about today that was signed off by our entire party room and indeed, the whole Opposition yesterday\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese has described the Opposition\u2019s posture on climate and energy as a step backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, the prime minister described the new policy as \"friendless\" and \"nonsensical\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They say that they want to stay in [the Paris agreement], but Paris is about the road to net zero, and you can\u2019t backslide.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor months, there have been protests and rallies, demonstrating against asylum seekers in Britain.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 109,000 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending March 2025, a 17 per cent rise on the previous year and six per cent above the 2002 peak [[of 103,081]].\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, sweeping changes have been announced to Britain's controversial asylum system as polls show immigration has overtaken the economy as voters' top concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Minister Shabana Mahmood told the BBC the government was tackling a critical issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is important that we deal with illegal migration into this country. It is an issue that is dividing our country, and I see this polarisation all over the country, including in my own constituency. We have a system that is out of control, it's unfair and is putting huge pressure on communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Home Office says the statutory duty to provide housing support and allowances to certain asylum seekers will be revoked, refugee status will become temporary and subject to regular review, and those granted asylum will have to wait 20 years before even being able to apply for permanency.\n\n\n\n\n\nShabana Mahmood again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the new reforms will do is change that generations-old assumption that sanctuary provided to refugees can very quickly lead to permanent settlement and all of the rights that go alongside that. We will be changing that to a more temporary process, and the situation will be assessed every two and a half years. So if your country becomes safe in that intervening period and you are remaining on this essentially core protection model, you will be returned to your country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also says there will be new routes for asylum seekers to be able to work while in the U-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are working and contributing, you will be able to earn an earlier settlement in this country and the totality of that package will promote fairness and contribution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe formal announcement has not taken anyone by surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, a delegation of senior Home Office officials visited Copenhagen to study Denmark's approach to asylum, where migrants are only granted temporary residence permits, usually for two years, and must reapply when these expire.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince coming to power in 2019, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has pursued a \"zero refugee\" policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Home Office says the approach has reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95 per cent of rejected applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust 860 asylum requests were granted last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decline in Denmark comes as the European Union is preparing plans on how they will implement overhauled rules for asylum seekers to be operational in mid-2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Britain, Shabana Mahmood says the new policy is not about turning away people who need help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We still believe very strongly, and I believe that we must provide sanctuary (to) those who are fleeing wars and danger and conflict abroad. We still want to be a country that does that. But at the moment, our system is particularly generous compared to other countries in Europe, where after five years, you'll be automatically settled in this country, we will change that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies as it seeks to stem the surging popularity of the populist Reform UK party, which has driven the immigration agenda and forced Labour to adopt a tougher line.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some government MPs have welcomed the changes, others have privately expressed concerns the policy could create division in the community and push Labour voters towards the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition Conservative Party is calling for the reforms to go further, as Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told the BBC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think these proposals are radical enough at all. Legal and illegal immigration is in danger of breaking Britain. We need radical solutions to that, including coming out of the ECHR so we can then deport every single illegal arrival within a week of their feet touching the shore. Stop paying benefits to foreign citizens and making sure the people who come here illegally can't claim asylum at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says the changes are designed to reduce the so-called \"pull factors\" by making Britain less attractive to would-be asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut advocates are horrified.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive of Britain's Refugee Council Enver Solomon told the BBC the plan would fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This policy will not stop the boats, it will not deter people. Refugees flee for their lives, and they go to countries where they may know people, family, they can speak the language or because of historical connections. So this policy will fall flat on its face.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 100 British charities have written to the Home Secretary, urging her to end what they've called the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-immigration sentiment has been growing in the UK, with recent protests taking place outside hotels sheltering asylum seekers with state funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir letter says such steps are only fuelling racism and violence.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Faiq Alyasare knows all too well the impact Australia's rising cost of living is having on the country\u2019s children.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlyasare, who moved to Perth from Iraq more than 25 years ago, is married with four kids between the ages of three and 14.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the sole income earner, the 50-year-old fly-in fly-out worker told SBS News he pushes himself to work as much as possible throughout the year, putting his hand up for extra weeks and avoiding taking sick days.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven then, he says it's become increasingly difficult to afford the basics, and stretching every dollar on essentials like rent and bills leaves little left over.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe remembers being able to pay $50 to fill up a supermarket trolley with all the groceries he needed.\n\n\n\n\"You go now, $50 isn't enough for one small bag,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are costs such as clothing for his children. \"Kids are always asking.\"\n\n\n\nClose to 1 million Australian children living in poverty\n\nOther families are also doing it tough. Data released by the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre and the Valuing Children Initiative on Monday found 950,000 children will live in poverty in 2025 \u2014 more than 15 per cent of all kids in Australia. That's up from 713,000 four years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data, based on information provided by the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, found the child poverty rate had spiked 33 per cent in four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nChild poverty is when a child lives in a household with a disposable income of less than 50 per cent of the national median income.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the median personal income in Australia for the 2022-23 financial year was $58,216.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates say the report shows that when Australia's families struggle with costs, children often pay the price \u2014 and that has serious consequences for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtin economics professor Alan Duncan said the rise in child poverty was not a statistical anomaly but \"the predictable result of housing stress, inadequate income support, and policy drift\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without meaningful intervention, Australia risks crossing the one-million-child threshold within months.\"\n\n\n\nRising rents a big factor\n\nDuncan said skyrocketing rents were a major factor in the surge in poverty, with the median advertised rent for units rising 40 per cent in Sydney, 34 per cent in Melbourne and 41 per cent in Brisbane between 2021 and 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country's west coast hasn't been immune either. Alyasare said that two years ago, he paid $500 a week in rent. Today, it\u2019s $800 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median rental price for a house in Perth is $850 a week, according to REA Group, rising 9.7 per cent in the past 12 months. The median rental price for a unit is $695, up 6.9 per cent in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlyasare's lease is set to end in the next six months. He says if his landlord tries to increase the rent, he won\u2019t be able to refuse, because he can't risk returning to the rental market and looking for another house.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the report, the End Child Poverty campaign has called for a \"child-centred\" definition of poverty and a method of measuring how poverty affects young people's wellbeing that is nationally agreed upon.\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign lead Sarah Quinton said poverty left children increasingly isolated, at a time when they should be developing important connections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report has also called for increases to relief payments and action to fix the structural causes of housing unaffordability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Alyasare, the cost of living has meant being unable to afford activities and programs that he knows would be beneficial for his kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For my son, I couldn't put him in the soccer team this year,\" he said. \"I took him off the team for this year and said: 'Let's see next year.'\"\n\n\n\nFaiq Alyasare could not afford the costs for his son's football team this year. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan Larissa Muir is the CEO of 12 Buckets, a Perth-based charity that provides mentoring to students facing disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Children are sensitive to their environment,\" she said. \"Missing out on sport or excursions undermines their sense of belonging. These inequalities shape their future.\"\n\n\n\nLong-lasting impacts\n\nDuncan agreed that poverty had long-lasting impacts on a child's life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We find that poverty gets under the skin,\" he told SBS News. \"It's something you carry with you for a large part of your life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlyasare worries about his children's future and how their potential may be damaged by not being able to afford the support they need to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis son \"likes to play soccer, but if you don't get professional coaching \u2026 he'll never go high-level,\" he said. \"Maybe he's talented, but nobody knows until he starts training.\"\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Alyasare can't afford extra lessons outside school to further his son\u2019s education. \"Maybe he's smart, bright, but he needs a push,\" Alyasare said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If he doesn't get help now to get a better future, that future is going to be downwards. And it will affect all society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA Department of Social Services spokesperson said \"all children in Australia deserve the best start to life\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said the Australian government is \"working to break the cycle of disadvantage, support people in need, and improve the wellbeing of families and children\", adding that the government had injected more than $11 billion in additional funding into the social security safety net in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cI call that a prerequisite. I say that there\u2019s a standard that these players with athletic traits...on whatever field, whatever sport you\u2019re in. \u201cLet\u2019s call them A, B, C and D. If you\u2019re E, you don\u2019t help. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Credit: AP \u201cOnce all the players, either are in A, B, C or D category, to me then it\u2019s all intangibles. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re an A athlete, but your intangibles are a C, they usually play to a B or a C.\n\n\u201cIntangibles will help you either meet or exceed your expectation.\u201d Stafford\u2019s career was founded on intangibles, as with many quarterbacks. Players who didn\u2019t fit in with teammates, weren\u2019t team-first, were often shunted. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there, we\u2019re like \u2018I think we ought to kick those guys off the boat, they\u2019re not helping us.\u2019\u201d In his office, Snead mentioned his friend, Sam Walker, whom the Los Angeles Rams employ as a consultant and who had recently been in Melbourne working with Brad Scott and Essendon on leadership. Zach Merrett and Andrew McGrath Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Last summer, Scott, Zach Merrett and Andy McGrath - Merrett\u2019s probable successor as skipper - went to LA to meet with Walker, who specialises in the construction of team ethos and leadership.\n\nEssendon\u2019s cultural issues, exemplified by Merrett\u2019s attempted escape, seemed relevant to another commandment on the wall: \u201cIMMERSE OUR PEOPLE IN THE RAMS WE THEN ME WAY.\u201d \u201cWE\u201d was coloured yellow against blue for emphasis. Here were other striking observations from Snead which hold relevance to the AFL draft (and trading/free agency): 1. Why a gun player can slide in the draft Puka Nacua, a star wide receiver, was drafted at pick No 177, the fifth round of the 2023 draft. Snead said Pacua had been overlooked by all teams in the early rounds because he did not fit the prototype for his position - which was biased to speed.\n\nNacua, too, was injured in his final college year. \u201cIn the draft, let\u2019s call it the higher you get... usually there\u2019s a cleaner profile. That\u2019s just the way the probabilities work. \u201cHis game is strength and power, probably bully ball - catch the ball and I\u2019m now going to have to make you tackle me, and a lot of times that\u2019s devalued in the draft. We\u2019ve seen some of the players that fit that profile, they get devalued, because it\u2019s a spacing game, speed, explosiveness. A young Sam Mitchell Credit: Peter Mathew \u201cThere was a strategy there. And we could probably get him a little later. Now based on all things considered we should have picked him earlier.\u201d The AFL clubs will all be hoping, no matter the odds, of finding their version of Nacua (188 cm and 96 kilograms), who is his sport\u2019s answer to Chris Grant, James Hird, Sam Mitchell, Tom Stewart and others who were bypassed early in the draft. The knock on Mitchell was that he was small and slow.\n\nLoading 2. Which are the hardest players to assess in the draft and why? A simple answer to this one from Snead: Quarterbacks. Why? \u201cNFL\u2019s the highest level of a video game... The game in college is different to the NFL and the quality is not as good....there\u2019s more space. \u201cIn the NFL, there\u2019s hardly any space... Can you, as that QB then, as things [happen], speed up?\n\nIn the AFL, the draft record suggests key forwards are harder to identify than midfielders. Key forwards - and some key backs - don\u2019t necessarily replicate junior success in the AFL. Like quarterbacks, they face congestion in the big league. The Rams traded in Stafford, knowing he was a proven commodity, in the same way that the Swans acquired Curnow, and Tony Lockett, Barry Hall and Lance Franklin before him. When did Sydney last draft a quality key forward? \u201cYou cut out the risk when you trade for quarterback,\u201d said Snead. Charlie Curnow as a Swan. Credit: Eddie Jim 3. Trading in mature players for draft picks when in the premiership window\n\nSnead follows a method similar to AFL clubs who believe you only give up draft capital when entering contention. One factor he mentioned is seldom raised in the AFL - that of the senior coach also being \u201cin his prime\u201d. The LA Rams win the Super Bowl in 2022. Credit: AP \u201cIn the year we won the Super Bowl \u2026 we had a lot of players in their prime. \u201cSo we used like some of our premium draft picks to make trades, to bring in other players in their prime.\n\n\u201cThat might not be the strategy if you\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Stafford was acquired from the Detroit Lions using that formula. \u201cA lot of his teammates were in their prime, the head coach was in his prime. It was like, \u2018OK, if we add a QB in his prime\u2019, now you have, at least on paper, a more complete [team]. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there and you\u2019re getting there, you might be a little bit heavier [in the] draft.\u201d 4. What to do once a team enters \u201cno man\u2019s land?\u201d No man\u2019s land, as defined by a senior AFL club official (to his board) was neither rebuilding, nor contending (nor the half-way house of \u201cbuilding\u201d). Snead, when this was put to him, liked the concept and spoke as if he\u2019d been in that predicament.\n\n\u201cNo man to me is you\u2019ve got to tear it down first. Which is, \u2018oh wow, we have to tear this thing down over two seasons.\u2019 That ought to be fun and I\u2019m sure the fans are going to have trust in us, right? Loading \u201cMine would be, if you\u2019re in no man\u2019s [land], you\u2019ve got to tear it down. That may be you\u2019re a team that\u2019s older, right, and now how to do you move on... I call the rebuilding/building...or I call it remodelling.\u201d Melbourne and Carlton, mired in no man\u2019s land in 2025, would appear to have followed Snead\u2019s formula, to an extent, by trading out Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver and Charlie Curnow, as Tom De Koning walked as a free agent.

        "text": "Loading The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said in a statement that it was \u201cgathering information to establish the facts of the matter and will investigate to assess whether there has been any non-compliance with the Triple Zero rules. If any breaches are identified, appropriate enforcement action will be taken. \u201cPublic safety and reliable access to emergency services are of paramount importance. Under rules introduced in 2024, telecommunications providers must notify their customers where the provider identifies that the customer\u2019s device may not be able to connect to Triple Zero and then take action to block those devices from their networks.\u201d The tragedy comes just two months after three people died during a major Optus outage in mid-September, when more than 600 calls to Triple Zero emergency services failed to connect. That incident, which lasted more than 90 minutes, prompted a federal government inquiry and led to parliament fast-tracking new legislation to strengthen oversight of emergency calling services. The September Optus outage was the second major Triple Zero failure for the telco in two years. In November 2023, more than 2000 calls to emergency services failed to connect during a 12-hour national network outage, resulting in a $12 million fine from ACMA.\n\nThe incidents have shaken public confidence in Australia\u2019s emergency services infrastructure and put intense pressure on both telcos and device manufacturers to ensure Triple Zero access. Communications Minister Anika Wells. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong The watchdog disclosed just last month that some older Samsung mobile phones released between 2015 and 2017 could not automatically switch to alternative networks to complete Triple Zero calls. Testing revealed that 71 Samsung models were affected, with 11 requiring replacement and 60 needing software updates. The problem stems from legacy firmware configurations that attempt to route emergency calls through Vodafone\u2019s now-defunct 3G network. When Telstra and Optus networks are unavailable, these devices cannot successfully switch to TPG\u2019s 4G network as a back-up. Wells last month warned that the Samsung phone problems could be \u201cindicative of a broader systemic issue\u201d in Australia\u2019s telecommunications emergency services.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of devices nationwide that may be affected by the issue. Some 46,000 devices are thought to be affected across Australia\u2019s three major carriers. TPG identified affected devices last year during preparations for the national shutdown of 3G services and blocked them from its network, sharing information with Telstra and Optus. However, Telstra engineers recently discovered during testing that the same Samsung devices were still attempting to connect Triple Zero calls via Vodafone\u2019s decommissioned 3G infrastructure. \u201cWhy this was configured this way is a question for Samsung and Vodafone,\u201d a Telstra spokesman said. Vodafone owner TPG described the issues as related to a \u201clegacy configuration within the devices themselves\u201d. The company identified additional Samsung devices this year requiring software updates, and has been blocking devices that haven\u2019t been upgraded, as required under new regulations. \u201cWhen TPG Telecom became aware of these handsets on its network, we communicated with customers to urgently update affected devices,\u201d the company said on Tuesday morning. \u201cHandsets not updated are blocked after a period of 28 to 35 days from the first contact to the customer, as required under new regulations.\n\n\u201cThe most recent communications to customers with impacted devices was sent on 7 November. These updates are critical to ensure compactibility with emergency services and to protect customer safety.\u201d Under rules that took effect from November 1, telcos must test whether mobile phones can switch to other networks during Triple Zero outages, report failures in real time, and disconnect phone services within 28 to 35 days of notifying customers that their devices cannot connect to emergency services. Loading Parliament last month also passed legislation creating a new Triple Zero Custodian with compliance powers to ensure emergency services remain accessible. The custodian can impose maximum fines of $30 million for breaches of Triple Zero rules \u2013 a tenfold increase from previous penalties. The government has also ordered telcos to create separate public registers of Triple Zero outages, though carriers have raised concerns about the technical and cost challenges of real-time reporting. TPG warned that implementing real-time reporting for unplanned outages would \u201crequire substantial system changes and cost across our operations\u201d.",

        "text": "A back stress injury meant Uwland missed this year\u2019s championships after an outstanding bottom-age campaign last year that had him pegged as the best prospect in the 2025 class. The man viewed as Errol Gulden 2.0 did not reach those heights in the limited football he played after recovering, but his football IQ is as good as anyone\u2019s in this draft. He boasts silky skills and can run all day. Might captain the Suns one day. If not: There has been noise for a while, which heated up during the trade period, that the Eagles might bid on Carlton father-son defender Harry Dean. They could also opt to bid on Dylan Patterson or Daniel Annable here. This is not what the Blues were hoping, but the Eagles look poised to do it. Dean is widely rated as a top-five talent. He is one of the best key defender prospects in years, and stands out because there is a major shortage of that position in this crop. He aggressively flies for marks and spoils, reads the ball superbly, and has the athleticism, composure and skills to thrive at the top level.\n\nIf not: West Coast bid on Dylan Patterson instead, or stopped bidding and went for Cooper Duff-Tytler instead. The Eagles have long been linked to Duff-Tytler, a talented ex-basketballer who boasts similar traits to AFL ruck stars Luke Jackson and Tom De Koning with his athleticism, leap, agility and follow-up work. He showed in a VFL appearance for Essendon, where he played predominantly as a forward, that he can impact the game in attack as well, even if that remains a query in some quarters. Should develop rapidly in an AFL environment. If not: There is talk that Essendon would love to try to snatch West Coast\u2019s No.2 pick after securing Carlton\u2019s No.9, but the likeliest scenario is Duff-Tytler is heading west.\n\nPatterson might be the most damaging and exciting player in this year\u2019s draft. He takes the game on with his kicking and fast feet \u2013 including a nasty goose step \u2013 and sometimes tries to do too much, but showed in a VFL game against Carlton late in the season that he can rein his attacking nature in. Likened to Andrew McLeod, Patterson rejected NRL clubs\u2019 overtures to stay on the AFL path, and could be a difference-maker for the Suns. If not: It seems West Coast will bid on Dean after Uwland. That means the Tigers will bid on Patterson, and that is now expected to be before they pick an unattached player, but maybe they make a live pick first. The Lions\u2019 premiership window will never shut if kids like Annable keep popping up, after the Ashcroft brothers arrived in recent years. Annable racks up disposals, excels at stoppages and is creative by hand. There are all sorts of flattering comparisons ahead of the draft each year, and recruiters see a bit of Simon Black in Annable. Brisbane will gleefully match any bid on Annable, and would quietly be chuffed if it comes this late. If not: The Tigers picked an unattached player first, such as Sam Cumming, Sullivan Robey or Xavier Taylor.\n\nThe consensus view is that the Tigers would not have flown to Mildura just to do their due diligence on Cumming, so expect him to head to Punt Road. A shoulder injury cut his season short, but not before he stamped himself as a top-10 pick. He is a dual-position threat who impacts the game as a deep forward with his marking ability and knack for kicking goals, or as a midfielder, where his physicality, aggression and dynamism are all ticks. There have even been Mark Ricciuto comparisons. Recruiters also like Cumming\u2019s defensive commitment. If not: Richmond went for Sullivan Robey or Xavier Taylor instead. Two of the three should be in yellow and black. Robey is this year\u2019s bolter, after many clubs hoped they could keep him a secret once he graduated from Rowville\u2019s senior side to belatedly burst onto the scene for the Ranges mid-season. He grew about 17 centimetres in the past two years and developed physically, in equal parts owing to an impressive home gym and his dedication. First made his mark as a lead-up forward, then showed his strength and power as a midfielder.\n\nIf not: The Tigers are also strongly linked to Xavier Taylor and Sam Cumming, but are not expected to consider Sam Grlj here. Taylor once polarised because of inconsistent decision-making and execution, including a habit for kicking into the man on the mark \u2013 but he has cleaned that up (mostly), and risen sharply on draft boards. Was best afield in the Ranges\u2019 grand final triumph, where his intercepting skills, athleticism, versatility and competitiveness were on show. Importantly, there is confidence Taylor will stand up defensively in the AFL. If not: Richmond picked Taylor over Sam Cumming or, more likely, Sullivan Robey, meaning one of those latter two slipped through to the Bombers.\n\nThe suspicion is the Bombers will invest in at least one midfielder after parting with Dylan Shiel, Will Setterfield and Ben Hobbs, on top of the Zach Merrett situation, Darcy Parish\u2019s injury history, and with Elijah Tsatas still proving himself. Sharp won the Larke Medal as the best-performed player at the championships, and is a physical, competitive onballer who wins the ball in big doses. If not: Essendon have also been linked to Sullivan Robey, Sam Cumming, Jacob Farrow, Lachy Dovaston and forward-ruck Aidan Schubert. One different move changes a lot of what comes next. The Demons are never afraid to go against the grain, but this may depend on whether Sam Cumming or Xavier Taylor are available. This is higher than Nairn has been projected, but Melbourne have him in their sights. Nairn had a seven-goal game at the championships before demonstrating his ball-winning wares with consecutive 30-plus-disposal outings to end the season. He is a high-IQ footballer, runs all day on the wing, could develop into an inside midfielder, marks well overhead and is a neat kick. If not: They would love Sam Cumming, Sullivan Robey or Xavier Taylor to still be on the board. Melbourne might select defender Jacob Farrow, or one of small forwards Latrelle Pickett or Lachy Dovaston.\n\nFarrow\u2019s draft range starts at Essendon\u2019s picks, and he has admirers into the mid-teens, but he should be long gone by then. He is one of the best kicks in this class \u2013 which should appeal to Melbourne \u2013 makes quick decisions, impacts the game as an interceptor, and showed his agility in combine testing. Farrow has also performed well in the midfield, but is more proven down back, where he will start and possibly stay in the AFL. If not: Small forwards Latrelle Pickett \u2013 cousin of Demon Kysaiah \u2013 or Lachy Dovaston may be considered instead, or they could look to fortify their key defensive posts for the future with Blake Thredgold. Dovaston, who hails from the same Talent League club as Nick Watson, is the best small forward in this draft. He might lack Watson\u2019s tricks, but still has his share, and has greater running capacity and is considered superior defensively to when the star Hawk was the same age. Dovaston kicks goals for fun (and lots of them), is consistent, has become more selfless, runs hard up and down the ground, and tested brilliantly at the combine.\n\nIf not: Essendon might go for another small forward, Latrelle Pickett, instead or add forward-ruck Aidan Schubert, who has been linked to Tullamarine throughout the year. Josh Lindsay and Sam Grlj are other options. The Hawks have interviewed Taylor in recent days, so he is at least in their mix. His stocks increased the longer the year went after not playing at the championships, capped by his eye-catching results at the combine, where he set the fastest 20-metre sprint time and finished second for agility. Taylor puts that acceleration to great use to quickly create separation and get the ball moving forward. He can tidy up his kicking and improve defensively. If not: Hawthorn might opt for speedster Sam Grlj or sweet-kicking defender Josh Lindsay instead.\n\nThredgold has been linked to North Melbourne for a while, so he might be the player they have in mind, assuming they secure Carlton\u2019s selection. Recruiters took notice of Thredgold\u2019s solid job last year as a bottom-ager on future Collingwood forward Charlie West. He also quelled fellow first-round prospect Mitch Marsh in this year\u2019s SANFL under-18 grand final and dominated in the air to cap a strong finals series. He is a tad undersized but a genuine lockdown defender who is strong, athletic and competitive. If not: The Roos might opt for forward-ruck Aidan Schubert, or whoever is still up for grabs between small forwards Lachy Dovaston or Latrelle Pickett. As always with bids, there is a great unknown, but there is enough noise about the Giants potentially bidding, after the Swans bid on Harry Rowston around this range three years ago. The Swans academy product finished top 10 in three tests at the combine, including winning the running vertical jump. Part of Kyle\u2019s appeal is that this was his first year in the academy, so there is serious scope for improvement. He is a good size, has a big tank and brings positional versatility. If not: GWS will probably select from a group including Oskar Taylor, Sam Grlj or Latrelle Pickett, but they are typically tough to predict.\n\nMelbourne star Kysaiah Pickett\u2019s cousin has top-20 interest in what is an even crop, but there is a chance he is still up for grabs in the 20s. The Demons, Essendon and North Melbourne are other possible landing points. Pickett turns 20 in December, so he is slightly older than his draft peers, but has impressed this year with his progress at Glenelg. He is quick, elusive, capable of the mercurial, and has the cheek that the best small forwards possess. If not: GWS might have the option of Oskar Taylor or Sam Grlj, both of whom they also like. West Coast are expected to make a bid on Murray, who has been mentioned in top-20 calculations in recent weeks. But the Suns rate him highly and it would be a shock if they did not match a bid on him here. A foot injury meant Murray did not play at the championships, but recruiters like his athleticism and toughness, and were impressed with how diligent he was with his rehab.\n\nIf not: The Eagles may bid on another Gold Coast academy player, Beau Addinsall. They would be doing so knowing the Suns are less likely to match a bid on Addinsall.\n\nGrlj was originally linked to Richmond, and could easily land at the Hawks or GWS. He would be difficult to pass up for the Eagles if he is still available. Grlj has speed to burn and was one of only two players to run the two-kilometre time trial quicker than six minutes at the combine. He entered top-five calculations with a superb start to the year before hitting a rough patch, but his VFL form for Richmond was excellent. Grlj could eventually become a midfielder, but will likely start at half-back. If not: There is chatter in the industry that Gold Coast academy midfielder Beau Addinsall might attract a bid in the teens, and clubs believe the only club likely to do that would be West Coast. Lindsay is an excellent decision-maker and arguably the best kick in the draft \u2013 the result of years of dedication honing his skills, including a strict morning routine \u2013 so this would be a good result for the Bulldogs. He has been a consistently high performer at all levels, and is viewed as a safe selection who could slot straight into a defensive role. There are varying opinions on whether Lindsay could develop into a midfielder.\n\nIf not: Sydney academy defender Lachy Carmichael is right in the frame here, and several clubs have him pencilled in as the Dogs\u2019 selection. The Swans might not match this early if that eventuates. Adelaide are tipped to go local, and they have kept in close touch with Marsh, who kicked the most goals at the 2025 championships. He emerged from the carnival as a top-10 contender who some thought could play other positions, but appears to have slid after a so-so end to the season. But the talent and upside are there, and Marsh would complement the likes of Riley Thilthorpe and Darcy Fogarty as a different attacking option. If not: There will be other viable South Australian players available, such as Harley Barker, Aidan Schubert and Jevan Phillipou.\n\nInjuries impacted the start of Ison\u2019s season, but the Blues\u2019 next-generation academy prospect finished strongly \u2013 and opposition recruiters took notice. Ison\u2019s height and aerial prowess make him a candidate to fill various roles across the ground, beyond just the midfield. There is still a smallish sample size on him, but the scouting report acknowledges that he can do things others in this range cannot, so Carlton will gleefully match a bid. If not: A bid on Ison might come later, with Fremantle a possibility. If the Cats don\u2019t bid on Ison, they may bid on Gold Coast\u2019s Beau Addinsall, and would be a good chance to get him. Archie Ludowyke has also been linked. Ludowyke started the year brightly for the Dragons and the AFL Academy after long being rated the best key forward in this class. However, he had a goalless championships \u2013 which was not all his fault, as a player relying on service \u2013 before suffering a season-ending PCL injury in Metro\u2019s win over the Allies. This would be a classic Cats play to invest in a player with good size and athleticism who launches himself at the Sherrin. If not: There is a scenario where Geelong Falcons defender Josh Lindsay is available here, while key forward Aidan Schubert is another potential option.\n\nSome clubs think this is too early for Williams, but if anyone makes a bid, the Dockers loom as the most likely for the speedy forward. He has all the traits to be a successful small forward at AFL level, but there is some projection here. Williams starred at the combine, placing second with a scintillating 2.89-second 20-metre sprint and also finished fourth in the agility test. If not: Williams may still be available into the 30s. The Dockers could bid on others, or look for a different forward. Freo are raised as a potential bidder here, and Sweid will probably receive a bid in the 20s somewhere. He recovered well from an ACL rupture that sidelined him for much of the 2024 season, and the Essendon next-generation academy prospect enjoyed a strong campaign. He is small, but that did not stop him at any of the levels he played at this year. Sweid\u2019s toughness, competitiveness, defensive commitment, and penchant for kicking goals while playing at half-forward endeared him to scouts.\n\nIf not: Sweid\u2019s wait will continue. The Dockers might bid on someone like Beau Addinsall or Max King instead.\n\nThere is risk with Barker, who sustained an ACL rupture playing for Sturt after earning All-Australian honours. If a club is willing to take that on board, there is so much to like about Barker\u2019s prospects, given he was considered a top-10 smokey after his championships performance. His size, speed, endurance and skill add up to an impressive package, and he uses his running ability to get involved at both ends. There is a chance he slides. If not: The whispers around the Dockers are that they are interested in a forward, so they might even bid on Max King or could go for Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves, and might even go for a mature-ager. Jevan Phillipou might be another option. Greeves is linked to the Hawks by virtue of their rejected application to include him in their next-generation academy program because of his Indigenous background. He also trained with them during the pre-season through the AFL Academy. Greeves is polarising \u2013 with most queries centred on his running ability \u2013 but a contested beast who has the height and ability to also impact the game when he plays as a marking forward.\n\nIf not: Hawthorn might opt for more firepower in attack, with someone such as Aidan Schubert or Liam Hetherton, who has also been linked to them. Could they place a bid on Beau Addinsall? The Bombers might snap up Schubert with one of their early picks, or North may already have drafted him with the pick they are expected to trade for from Carlton. His awkward ball drop and kicking style are talking points, and put some clubs off, while he measured shorter than some scouts expected. But Schubert had an outstanding championships to surge into the top-10 mix. Talls can sometimes drift, given the risks involved, but his competitiveness and endurance appeal. If not: Winger Harley Barker is a player of interest and would be in strong consideration if he is available. Forward-ruck Louis Emmett is another option.\n\nIn a draft where many prospects are flawed or erratic, Carmichael\u2019s ultra-consistency across several years is a big tick. The Dogs might even bid for him with their first pick, where they would have a strong chance of retaining him. Carmichael was an All-Australian at under-16 level in 2023, and earned that same honour at this year\u2019s under-18 championships, where he was also the Allies\u2019 MVP. Carmichael is defensively sound, but his kicking and relative lack of athleticism may keep him in this range. If not: The Dogs might only bid on Carmichael with their first pick. If they don\u2019t bid on him, they will likely go for a taller option instead. It becomes really difficult to know what will happen this deep into the draft, but the Bulldogs are linked to him and another athletic ruckman, Marcus Krasnadamskis. The popular view on Emmett, who finished third in the time trial at the combine, is that he will need to develop into a key-position player at either end \u2013 but there is upside here, and he will be a back-up ruck option at worst. His draft range starts earlier than this but could be wider.",

Increasing use of the yuan in international transactions also helps extend and expand its spheres of influence.\n\nAt China\u2019s Fourth Plenum meeting of the Communist Party last month, the senior leaders spelled out more clearly than they had previously their plans for the yuan, saying China should \u201cpromote the internationalisation\u201d of the currency.",

        "text": "Before that series, Labuschagne had been full of brio when discussing how he knew exactly what was needed to deal with every member of England\u2019s then bowling attack. It\u2019s a level of confidence he lost somewhere along the way over six years of constant international cricket, but it\u2019s back now. \u201c[In 2019] I was averaging 60 in county cricket and just in that run scoring form when everything\u2019s clear. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re facing, it\u2019s just \u2018ok I\u2019ll do this, or this, or this is where they\u2019re bowling and I\u2019ll put them under pressure here\u2019. Jofra Archer. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWhen you\u2019re not going well it\u2019s the opposite, it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ve got to do this, I\u2019ve got to defend and grind\u2019, instead of \u2018nah I\u2019ll just play the ball like that because that\u2019s where the field or the plan is\u2019. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re not doing well or failing, there\u2019s doubt, I don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s what happens. But I think it was more the fact that my technique was in a space where I couldn\u2019t apply pressure to the opposition, so my only option was defensively to grind. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s shifted and why I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nLoading Alongside those memories of 2019 is a remarkable admission - through much of the rich run of scoring that followed for Australia, Labuschagne does not think he was playing particularly well. \u201cI\u2019ve had periods of being a prolific run scorer, the 2019-20 Pakistan, New Zealand summer here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even then I don\u2019t think I was necessarily batting that good. I was just a good decision-maker and I was in a rhythm of scoring runs, so you\u2019re able to repeat that consistently.\u201d Labuschagne does not yet know whether he is going to bat in his customary number three spot or shift back up to opening with Usman Khawaja, saying: \u201cit\u2019s not as simple as work out your one, two, three\u201d. But he does know he will be batting far better than last summer, where at times he both looked and felt like a sitting duck. \u201cMy technique\u2019s in a spot now where I can score off more deliveries and now it\u2019s about decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cI was nowhere near my best last summer, but I still managed to play some crucial innings in a series. But it\u2019s certainly not the way I want to be playing, as restricted as I was then.\n\nLoading \u201cWhen you get that space, you sit back and go, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t want to be going back to that, playing that type of cricket where I\u2019m so restricted and feel like the only way is to grind\u2019. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen this season so far, probably a different Marnus than you have in the last few years.\u201d Labuschagne spoke glowingly of Joe Root, calling him \u201cthe best batter in the world at the moment\u201d. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t see the best of Joe Root this summer, for Australia if we can keep him quiet and put him under pressure to score runs that\u2019d be really good for us. But the reality is he\u2019s a class player and the best batter in the world at the moment. The way he goes about it, he\u2019s one of the greats.\u201d But the Queenslander\u2019s own return to the Australian top six provides another warning to England, by showing how much batting in these conditions can be required to feel at home again.\n\n\u201cThe month I had in the West Indies with [Matt] Wadey and Diva [Michael Di Venuto], working there and with Ron [Andrew McDonald] and just batting and not having any pressure on me was the start of the process of getting back,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnically, I hadn\u2019t landed on what I needed to land on then, but it felt like I was getting back to that freedom, and I just wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if I was in the team. As that progressed into coming here, I thought the only way I\u2019m going to get back to playing my best is if I just played games. Loading \u201cSo I played four or five club T20 games to get out there and bat and be able to find that feeling of scoring runs. I played two practice games against Tasmania, and it was the same thing, building up scoring runs in the middle and getting that feeling of trusting my game.\u201d England have played one measly warm-up game and on Tuesday will have their first session in the fast Perth Stadium nets.",

Not that the early start, or jet lag, stops your correspondent from getting the full Scaramucci experience. The Mooch talks fast and he talks big. He drops expletives liberally and greets me with jokes about the \u201cfake news media\u201d followed by a conciliatory bear hug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he has the self-deprecating sense of humour that emerges when your claim to fame is being a global punchline. The joke that preceded the punchline was the first Trump presidency. Scaramucci became White House communications director in July 2017, and infamously lasted just 11 days in an episode that would come to symbolise the chaos and dysfunction that plagued Trump\u2019s Washington. The whole thing began to unravel when Scaramucci phoned The New Yorker\u2019s Washington correspondent, Ryan Lizza, and launched into a lengthy, profanity-laden tirade that involved some extremely colourful editorialising about a couple of his White House colleagues. Scaramucci insisted the conversation was off the record. Lizza, and The New Yorker, said it was not, and duly hit publish. Five days later, the Mooch was fired. There has never been a shorter-serving communications director. Anthony Scaramucci, as the director of communications for the White House, during a press briefing in July, 2017. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cI made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he tweeted. Mercifully, our breakfast is entirely on the record, and the Mooch seems in a trusting enough mood. The conversation is made easier by the fact that these days, Scaramucci, 61, has no trouble telling the world how he really feels about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re inside Trump\u2019s near orbit you hate his guts. Don\u2019t forget that,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s [Trump] in it for the money and he\u2019s in it for the attention. He\u2019s not in it to serve the American people or to make the country better. He\u2019s into punishing people. He believes in humiliation rituals, particularly for our allies.\u201d When Trump gave Prime Minister Anthony Albanese the cold shoulder for months, there were widespread fears Australia would be subject to such a humiliation ritual. Instead, Scaramucci says, the prime minister and ambassador Kevin Rudd played the Trump game well. US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in October. Scaramucci says Albo \u201cplayed the game well\u201d with Trump. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cRemember, you\u2019re going on stage in a live reality television show that\u2019s being produced by Donald Trump. And so you can go in there reactive, and then you\u2019re going to get destroyed.\u201d Unlike Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky, or South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Rudd and Albo went in and \u201cco-produced\u201d the production. As for Rudd\u2019s now-deleted mean tweets about the US president?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sending out critical tweets of Trump he has way more respect for you than you think because he hates himself,\u201d Scaramucci tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s a bad human being, prima facie bad human being. And he\u2019s prima facie out to hurt people.\u201d How, and why then, did Scaramucci end up working for such a bad person? A blue-collar Italian-American kid from Long Island, Scaramucci hustled and bustled his way into the East Coast elite by way of Harvard Law (where he was a contemporary of Barack Obama) and Goldman Sachs, before starting his own investment firm, SkyBridge Capital. Along the way, he crossed paths with Trump, another quintessential \u201cNew Yawker\u201d, and the pair had known each other for two decades before the 2016 election. \u201cYou can never say that you\u2019re friends with Donald Trump because then you\u2019re overstating the relationship. You\u2019re an acquaintance. It\u2019s quite transactional,\u201d the twice-married father of five says. Scaramucci describes himself as a lifelong Republican with a lower-case \u201cr\u201d (he believes in things like same-sex marriage and women\u2019s reproductive rights, and is envious of Australia\u2019s gun control regime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, the Mooch had been a little politically flirtatious, supporting Obama in 2008, Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, and working on the doomed campaign of Republican frontrunner Jeb Bush in the 2016 primaries. When Bush dropped out, Scaramucci joined the Trump campaign. \u201cI made a decision to go work for Donald Trump, which was a combination of ego-based decision-making and moral equivocation,\u201d Scaramucci says. Michael Douglas as Gordon Gecko in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. The Mooch had a brief cameo in the 2010 movie. It was, the Mooch says, a big mistake. But it\u2019s a mistake that has made him famous. Trump\u2019s celebrity is radioactive. The MAGA-verse is full of people who owe money, power and influence to their decision to kiss the presidential ass. Similarly, there is a thriving cottage industry of Republican rebels, whose excoriating of their old party, coupled with insider-ish commentary on the Trump circus, has found a vast audience among liberal types equal parts fascinated and repulsed by the binfire in the Oval Office. Legend has it that Scaramucci once paid $US100,000 for a brief cameo in Oliver Stone\u2019s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Trump has given the Mooch far more fame than 15 seconds in a middling 2010 sequel ever could.\n\nAdvertisement",
