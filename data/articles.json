(Supplied)\n\n\"She said, 'Dad, it's these thongs', so I was chasing footwear,\" said the crane driver from Townsville.\n\n\"Then she started turning her head, and she was having little funny eye episodes,\" Pedersen said.\n\nPedersen took his daughter to an ophthalmologist, who told them to get to a doctor straight away.\n\n\"She didn't elaborate, but we found out soon after that Amy's ophthalmologist had lost both of her children to brain cancer,\" Pedersen said.\n\nWith no cure for the aggressive cancer, and limited treatment options, most children with DIPG die within a year.\n\nHaving caught the tumour relatively early, Amy managed to live for 16 more months, before she died, aged 9, in 2009.\n\nFor years after her death, Pedersen would find heartwrenchingly sweet handwritten notes Amy had left for him around the house.\n\nREAD MORE: Steve donated his kidney to a stranger and set an Australian record\n\nRen Pedersen's daughter Amy died in 2009, aged 9. Pictured at right is one of the many notes from Amy that Pedersen found after her death. (Supplied)\n\n\"They would say things like, 'Don't give up, Dad',\" he said.\n\n\"She'd hide them in between a pair of shorts or something like that.\"\n\nThe notes tracked the progression of Amy's illness as she lost the ability to write with her right hand and had to relearn the skill with her left.\n\n\"There were dozens of notes,\" he said.\n\n\"I get them out every now and again, but I can't lie to you, they're very hard to read.\"\n\nLosing Amy galvanised Pedersen into action, inspiring him to fight for a cure for DIPG.\n\nHaving no medical background proved to be somewhat of an advantage for Pedersen, who simply jumped right in, approaching Australia's leading oncologists and neurosurgeons he had come to know well during Amy's illness.\n\n\"I used these personal connections and I asked, once my daughter passed away, 'What would you do? What can I do as a father to empower you to save these kids in the future?'\" Pedersen said.\n\n\"The first thing we needed was autopsy samples. So I had parents approach me with children with terminal illness, and we created protocols that could debulk or remove the tumours from these deceased children.\"\n\nRen Pedersen, pictured with his daughter Amy, and (right) more of the notes she left for him in their home. (Supplied)\n\nWith the help of Pedersen's connections, the Children's Cancer Institute established Australia's first-ever tumour bank for DIPG in 2011, led by Associate Professor David Ziegler \u2013 a paediatric oncologist at Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, as well as a cancer researcher at the Institute.\n\nResearch into DIPG has come a long way in the past 15 years, with significant breakthroughs made by Australian researchers.\n\nIn 2021, research from Ziegler's team was published showing the tantalising potential of a revolutionary drug combination.\n\nPre-clinical testing in mouse models showed impressive results, with the promising drug combination leading to survival in two-thirds of the mice.\n\nIn March this year, another Australian-led study investigating incurable brain cancers, including DIPG, was published.\n\nThe study of 252 patients, 153 of whom had DIPG, revealed that 7.5 percent of the children had important changes in cancer predisposition genes, including the BRCA gene, best known for its association with breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nFor the first time, the research showed the tumours could develop because of underlying germline variants. The study may have major therapeutic implications and help researchers understand how the tumours begin and how they might be treated.\n\nHowever, the challenge remains to bridge the gap between groundbreaking research and accessible treatments.\n\n\"What we've got to do is get these treatments to the bedsides of the children,\" Pedersen said.\n\nWith this core aim in mind, Pedersen - who has received an Order of Australia medal for his work - launched \" Ren's Million Dollar Mission \" last November.\n\nThe mission aims to raise one million dollars for the Children's Cancer Institute , with Pedersen vowing to seek out 1000 individuals or companies who could each donate $1000.\n\n\"It's quite a daunting thing,\" Pedersen said.\n\n\"I'm in a town that's just been smashed by floods. It's had the toughest year. But I thought, surely there's got to be 1000 people across Australia with $1000 who can tap on a credit card.\n\nSo far, Pedersen has raised $110,000 in Townsville alone. He is now casting his net wider and taking his mission to the bigger cities, visiting Sydney next week.",

We keep track of each party's election promises so voters can make an informed decision.\n\n\"Tasmania has a spending problem at the moment.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we can get our spending back under control.\"\n\nThat partially refers to the fact the state has a history of spending more than it budgets for, particularly in health.\n\nHere's how the Liberals and Labor have been treating the issue of spending and budget repair:\n\nParties often spend big at elections\n\nElections are often a big-spending affair.\n\nThe Liberals have previously been accused of pork barrelling (slang for bribing the electorate for their votes), but they say they are simply listening to community concerns.\n\nLabor also promised a whole heap of community grants last election. The main difference is the relevant department would eventually assess them to decide if they were worthy of spending money on.\n\nYour Say: Tell us what matters to you this Tasmanian election Photo shows Have your say for the Tasmanian election. We want to know what issues matter most to you and what you want us to find out as Tasmania goes to another election.\n\nThere are also a whole heap of other policies, such as the stamp duty exemption for first home buyers, that will cost taxpayers money.\n\nAnd those spending promises really add up.\n\nEconomist Saul Eslake says Treasury data shows the 2018 and 2021 elections each added $1.4 billion of spending to the budget without any mention of how to pay for the promises.\n\nLast year's was even more expensive.\n\nSaul Eslake says that as a proportion of our economy, Tasmania's debt is larger than that of any other state or territory. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\n\"The government in the 2024 election committed to spending $1.7 billion whilst only mentioning $11 million of revenue by way of a levy on short-stay accommodation,\" Mr Eslake said.\n\n\"[The levy is] about the only election commitment that hasn't been met since the election.\n\n\"Labor would've spent an additional $2 billion over five years if they had won.\n\n\"So, to hope that that wouldn't be repeated in the election campaign would be a bit like Samuel Johnson's definition of second marriage \u2014 a triumph of hope over experience.\"\n\nSaul Eslake has long suggested that Tasmania swap stamp duty for land tax. (ABC News)\n\nHow could Tasmania increase its revenue?\n\nAt the moment, 40 per cent of Tasmania's money comes from the carve up of GST. Around a third is own-source revenue.\n\nThe Tasmanian state budget has been handed down. What's in it? Photo shows A female paramedic walks past an ambulance parked outside the Royal Hobart Hospital. The Tasmanian budget has been handed down for 2025-26. So what's being spent where?\n\nMr Eslake has put forward several options to raise more money, including collecting more payroll tax from businesses, raising car registration fees, adding a duty on the purchase of expensive new motor vehicles \u2014 \"with appropriate concessions for pensioners and other low-income earners\".\n\nHe also suggested switching stamp duty to a land tax and increasing mining royalties.\n\nHe says Tasmania collects about $40-50 million a year less than it would if its scheme was equivalent to those of other states.\n\nTreasurer Guy Barnett's 2025-26 state budget included more than $1 billion for health services over the next four years. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nMoney could also be found by asking the salmon industry to pay royalties for the use of Tasmanian waters.\n\n\"If they were to pay a royalty of 5 per cent of revenue, for example, that could potentially raise $6.75 million for the budget annually,\" Mr Eslake said.\n\n\"That wouldn't solve Tasmania's problems, of course, but it would make a useful contribution to reducing the deficit over time.\"\n\nAll of these ideas have been rejected by the major parties.\n\nMr Rockliff also pointed out that legislative changes in 2023 meant the salmon industry now pays for its own regulation.\n\n\"The salmon companies cost government. They return that to government, so it's cost neutral and that's been a significant reform under our government,\" he said.\n\nSalmon farming in Tasmanian waters has been a divisive issue.

(ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nBoth major parties have revealed their plans to find some savings, and they include the creation of new units.\n\nThe Liberals' plan, which was announced in March, is called the Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU); Labor has the Review and Evaluation Unit (REU).\n\nTwo names and slightly different descriptions for two things that will do very similar things \u2014 examine the effectiveness and value for money of government programs to try and identify savings.\n\nThe Liberals are assuming they will be able to cut spending to the point where in three years' time overall government expenses will be less than they are this year.\n\nThey hope to find savings through:\n\nAn efficiency dividend of $300 million over three years that started in the 2024-25 financial year\n\nA productivity and efficiency measure that replaces the efficiency dividend in 2027\u201328. It'll be aiming to find at least $150 million in savings across the whole of government sector in that first year\n\nCutting 2,500 public sector jobs over the next decade\n\nLabor's plans to \"save the budget more than half a billion dollars\", while not outlined in an alternative budget, were part of leader Dean Winter's budget reply speech.\n\nThey hope to do this by:\n\nAbandoning the fifth lane on the Southern Outlet ($160m savings)\n\nRemoving the associate secretary roles put in place a few years ago ($8 million per year)\n\nDitching the Liberals' $10 million tourism voucher scheme (the vouchers are due to be dispensed during the election period)\n\nSetting a cap on departmental spending on consultants, government advertising and travel ($60m savings)\n\nCutting the number of government media advisers in half (saving $5 million over the forward estimates)\n\nThis list is far from extensive, however, none of the policies have been costed by treasury.\n\nIf the party that wins government does not right the ship, Mr Eslake estimates Tasmania is heading to a debt of $16 billion by 2035 with repayments to hit $750 million a year.\n\n\"We've gone from in the middle of the past decade, being a net creditor, that is having more money in the bank than the government owes by way of debt, to now having debt and other liabilities,\" Mr Eslake said.",

(Supplied: Woodside)\n\nMr Watt gave Woodside 10 days to respond to the approval's \"strict\" conditions, which he indicated focused on the protection of ancient Aboriginal rock art.\n\nLast Friday, the gas giant breezed past that deadline and neither Woodside nor Mr Watt could confirm the date negotiations would be finalised when asked by the ABC.\n\nMs Walker said she was \"alarmed\" that the right of reply was afforded solely to Woodside.\n\n\"We understand there are statutory requirements, however, the approvals process has sidelined Murujuga Ngurrara-ngarli [Murujuga traditional owners],\" she wrote.\n\n\"They have a process with Woodside and the government, but they don't take into account our cultural processes, which we have as well, which is very saddening.\"\n\nWatt yet to visit Pilbara\n\nMs Walker repeated calls for Mr Watt to visit Murujuga \u2014 the Aboriginal name for the Burrup Peninsula \u2014 where Woodside's main processing plant is located, about 1,500 kilometres north of Perth.\n\nThe area is home to some of the world's oldest known rock art, the preservation of which became a flashpoint amid the extension decision.\n\nThe Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC) administers cultural matters involving the peninsula on behalf of five language groups: the Ngarluma, Mardudhunera, Yaburara, Yindjibarndi, and Wong-Goo-Tt-Oo peoples.\n\nThe corporation was formed in 2006 and granted joint management of Murujuga National Park in exchange for extinguishing native title rights to land earmarked for industrial development.\n\nThe chair of MAC, Peter Hicks, flew to Canberra this week to meet with Mr Watt.\n\nMurujuga Aboriginal Corporation says it is satisfied the North West Shelf project is not damaging ancient Aboriginal rock art. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nMr Hicks said he was confident findings of a two-year rock art monitoring program, carried out by MAC and the WA government, showed the North West Shelf project was not currently harming the ancient petroglyphs.\n\nThe rock art is central to the organisation's bid to have Murujuga listed by the United Nations as a World Heritage site.\n\nThis goal was thrown into doubt by a UNESCO draft decision calling for the area's industrialisation to be halted, triggering protests from the federal government.\n\nWhile Ms Walker backed the embattled World Heritage push, she said more consultation on the North West Shelf project and its impact was needed.\n\n\"Broader consultation means speaking with the whole community, all of the families, the connections who have a connection to the place,\" Ms Walker explained.\n\n\"The minister needs to speak to us, according to our cultural protocols,\" she said.\n\n\" We need a seat at the table when these decisions are being made. \"\n\nA law professor says Mr Watt could make the conditions public, given the wide-ranging concern over his decision. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nShe argued that the violation of traditional owners' informed consent was grounds for a human rights complaint, and current economic arrangements between Woodside and traditional owners had become obsolete.\n\n\"It is severely remiss of the Commonwealth to consider approving a major project while relying on an outdated agreement that is in urgent need of modernisation,\" Ms Walker said.\n\nMr Watt did not respond to specific questions put to him by the ABC.\n\nPublishing conditions 'justified'\n\nSamantha Hepburn, a professor at Deakin Law School, said it was not typical for proponents to miss response deadlines, although this case was \"unique\" given its magnitude and the extent of public interest.\n\nDr Hepburn believed Mr Watt possessed the legal discretion to make the conditions public and would be \"justified\" in doing so because the approval was so controversial.\n\n\"We see a broad range of the community very, very concerned about the impact that this extension is likely to have and wanting to make sure that the conditions are capable of addressing those concerns,\" she said.\n\n\" Transparency [means] we can feel secure as a community that the rule of law is doing its job effectively and with integrity. \"\n\nThe decision to extend the major gas project is currently facing court challenges on several fronts.\n\nMs Walker says failures to consult violated traditional owners' right to informed consent. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie Mclean)\n\nDr Hepburn said publicising the conditions would be a show of good faith ahead of federal environmental law reform, the subject of high-level talks hosted by Mr Watt on Thursday.\n\n\"Showing a preparedness to be responsive to the concerns, I think, is a very, very important thing that the government has the opportunity to [do],\" she said.\n\nMs Walker said she had only received a response from WA Senator Dorinda Cox, who could not be reached for comment.",

(AP: Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nLabuschagne was the top-ranked Test batter in the world as recently as two years ago, but has averaged just 27.82 for the past 12 months.\n\nHe was moved from his regular spot at number three to open in the World Test Championship final loss to South Africa last week, for returns of 17 and 22.\n\n\"Marnus at his best can be a really important member of this team. He understands his output hasn't been at the level we, or he, expects,\" Bailey said in a statement.\n\n\"We will continue working with him on the areas of his game we feel he needs to rediscover.\n\n\"We continue to value his skill and expect him to work through the challenge positively.\"\n\nKonstas's recall comes after he was left out of the team for Sri Lanka, following the teenager's high-profile start to Test life with a half-century on debut on Boxing Day against India.\n\nSam Konstas is likely to open in the West Indies. (Getty Images: Russell Freeman)\n\nSelectors opted to go with Travis Head at the top of the order in Galle, given their preference to have him open on spinning wickets.\n\nBut that move was only ever temporary, leaving the opening spot free for Labuschagne at Lord's last week and now seemingly Konstas in the West Indies.\n\nInglis also impressed with a century on debut in Galle in January, before being squeezed out of the side for the Test Championship final.\n\n\"Steve needs more time for the wound to heal so we'll give him another week's rest and assess his functionality after that,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"We have made the decision to give Josh and Sam the opportunity to replace Steve and Marnus.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"We are excited to see them get the chance to further their fledgling Test careers.\n\n\"In his only opportunity in Test cricket to date, Josh was outstanding in Sri Lanka, showing great intent and ability to put pressure on the opposition.\"\n\nThe decision to drop the 30-year-old Labuschagne comes after former coach Justin Langer urged officials to keep him in the side this week, with his experience valuable.\n\nUsman Khawaja is aged 38 and Smith 36, meaning a transition in the top order looms after David Warner's retirement from Test cricket last year.\n\n\"He's actually a very, very important link in this chain,\" Langer said on Monday.\n\n\"You think about the history of Australian cricket. The best young players come in surrounded by absolute guns.\n\n\"Michael Clarke, Ricky Ponting, Damien Martyn and Matthew Hayden. They come in and they're around gun players.\n\n\"If you just all of a sudden bring a couple of kids in, Cameron Green's still young to the game, and you have to bring another kid in there [to replace Labuschagne].\"\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\nBut given Western Australia again rewarded Anthony Albanese for his deference to the state, it's unlikely he will be racing to change those arrangements, despite the significant cost to the Commonwealth budget.\n\nIt gives the government financial power that many others could only dream of.\n\nA 'fortress' around WA\n\nThat power is nothing new, of course, and especially since COVID has been focused on two areas: immediate cost-of-living relief and building the Metronet projects that helped Labor get elected in the first place.\n\nThis budget effectively places both in the past.\n\nOnly a portion of Metronet projects remain unfinished, and the government's headline cost-of-living measure \u2014 hundreds of dollars off households' electricity bills \u2014 has been scrapped.\n\nMost of the government's Metronet projects have been completed. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nInstead, the bulk of the government's infrastructure spending \u2014 some 40 per cent, or $15.1 billion over the next four years \u2014 is being put towards power and water infrastructure and ports.\n\nSaffioti told parliament that infrastructure would enable private sector investment, which would help build a \"fortress\" around the state's economy, like the state did during the pandemic.\n\n\"While not a worldwide pandemic, the global instability and volatility we now face means we must once again stand together to repel any economic threat,\" she said.\n\n\" We protect our existing economic strengths but also venture to secure new jobs and new opportunities for Western Australia's future. \"\n\nBut some West Australians will be left wondering if such a heavy focus on the future is slightly premature.\n\n'Collateral damage'\n\nThe government argues economic pressures have eased, which is true, looking at key indicators.\n\nInflation has cooled, and there are signs the rental market is stabilising, even if prices remain higher than many can afford.\n\nSaffioti said that meant the risk of global turmoil had overtaken the cost of living as the most pressing issue for the government.\n\n\"We don't want WA to be collateral damage in global economic chaos,\" she told the ABC.\n\nBut people are still doing it tough, with ShelterWA still reporting \"overwhelming\" demand for housing support services.\n\nBasil Zempilas says the government missed its opportunity to help those doing it tough. (ABC News: Lauren Smith)\n\n\"The question really has to be asked: where is the cost-of-living pressure relief, [with] the cost of water up, the cost of electricity up, the cost of emergency services levy up?\" Opposition Leader Basil Zempilas said yesterday.\n\nThe government's solutions are targeted, which helps with not fuelling inflation again, but means some miss out.\n\nThe $337 million on offer for residential battery rebates and no-interest loans is great for those who own a home, and works into plans to develop a local battery manufacturing industry, but does nothing for renters or people without solar panels.\n\nAnother round of the up-to-$250 student assistance payment would be welcome relief for families, but it means nothing for anyone without school-aged children.\n\nAnd capping public transport fares at one zone will save $196, but it isn't much good for people not near public transport, or who need to drive for their work.\n\nTrouble ahead\n\nThe bigger, structural relief the government is promising will take some time to come.\n\nMore housing will be years away, given the long game of catch-up the construction sector is playing after a post-COVID population surge.\n\nThe five things you should know about the WA budget Photo shows WA Treasurer Rita Saffioti stands speaking in parliament. Roger Cook's government has handed down its second budget. Here's what you need to know.\n\nSecure skilled local jobs will also take time to materialise as the government's money to grow local industries filters through boardrooms and into construction and jobs.\n\nAnd pressures on the health system look set to continue, with those on the front line having little hope that promised changes will make that big a difference.\n\nIt won't be easy, even with time and money. Successive governments have tried to break WA's boom-and-bust cycle without any luck.\n\nAnd that global uncertainty Saffioti wants to protect the state against could arrive faster than her fortress.\n\nLuckily for the government, the next time voters will have a chance to pass judgement on their plans is in four years.\n\nBy then, they should have a sense of whether that fortress has been built or crumbled under the weight of reality.",

        "text": "A study claiming a popular exercise regimen called OsteoStrong can help strengthen bones in post-menopausal women has been criticised by scientists, with some saying it should never have been published.\n\nThe research, which was accepted for publication in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM) in February this year, was hailed as \"groundbreaking\" by the international franchise behind the exercise program.\n\n\"The acceptance of this research in a prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal like JCEM is a monumental step in validating OsteoStrong as a science-backed solution for osteoporosis management,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nBut the study has since attracted international criticism, with questions being raised about its design, data analysis and conclusions.\n\n\"We really questioned the [journal] editor on how this paper got through the peer-review process,\" said Robin Daly, a researcher in exercise and ageing at Deakin University.\n\n\" It had so many flaws and so many holes in it. \"\n\nClaims 'not supported by data'\n\nThe study examined the effectiveness of the OsteoStrong program, which was described as \"a bone-strengthening system implementing four devices and incorporating brief (10-minute), weekly, low-impact, and high-intensity osteogenic loading exercises\" in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\nThe researchers separated 147 women into two groups. One group did the program and the other did not. The group that did the exercise program was further divided into two groups, one of which was on bone-strengthening medication and one that was not.\n\nMeasures of bone strength were carried out at the start and end of the 12-month trial.\n\nThe study claimed bone density was improved in women who did OsteoStrong (compared to those who didn't), and that among participants who were also on medication, it enhanced the effect of the drugs.\n\n\"This is the first study that clearly demonstrates benefit\" from the OsteoStrong program, the researchers wrote.\n\nThis graph on the OsteoStrong Australia website suggests the program is more effective than drugs at increasing bone mineral density, which is contrary to mainstream understanding. (Supplied)\n\nBut among numerous concerns expressed by critics are that the clinical trial had no clear statistical plan, failed to reduce the risk of bias, had no ethical approval and was not registered online for transparency.\n\nAccording to Professor Daly, \"the claims [of the study] are totally misleading. They're not supported by the data\".\n\nHe said the way the study was designed and its results were analysed made it difficult to conclude anything.\n\n\"The whole paper is extremely difficult to interpret.\n\n\" There's no way that you can make a claim that it's an effective program. \"\n\nProfessor Daly and University of Waterloo bone researcher Lora Giangregorio sent a letter to the editor of the journal calling for the study's retraction.\n\nProfessor Giangregorio was concerned that publicity of the study's findings would lead people to make uninformed decisions about the OsteoStrong program.\n\n\"The way that they present the statistics actually doesn't make any sense,\" she said.\n\n\"The claims made in the study were not appropriate.\"\n\nOsteoStrong is an international franchise with hundreds of centres including in the US and Australia. (Getty Images: Smith Collection/Gado/Contributor )\n\nOther experts have also expressed concern about the failure of the study to adhere to normal standards and guidelines for clinical trials.\n\nThey were concerned the clinical trial was not registered, a practice that helps make research more transparent, and prevent publication bias.\n\nIt also lacked appropriate ethics approval and there were \"potential unacknowledged conflicts of interest\", Professor Daly added.\n\nIn March this year, Osteoporosis Canada expressed concern about the study and the evidence base for the OsteoStrong program.\n\nIn a statement, also co-authored by Professor Giangregorio, the organisation said:\n\n\u2026 Osteoporosis Canada cannot support recommendations regarding its use for fracture prevention based on existing research.\n\n'Does not provide believable evidence'\n\nChris Maher, director of the University of Sydney Institute for Musculoskeletal Health, agreed with the concerns raised about the study.\n\n\"That study is flawed and does not provide believable evidence on the effect of OsteoStrong,\" Professor Maher said.\n\nHe pointed specifically to the lack of registration and ethical clearance.\n\n\"It therefore does not conform to the Declaration of Helsinki, so it has no standing in medical science and should never have been published.\"\n\nMaria Fiatarone Singh, a University of Sydney geriatrician who researches the impacts of exercise, was also highly critical of the study.\n\n\"I think it is too flawed to draw any conclusions,\" she commented by email.\n\n\"It is shocking that the editors allowed this to be published in a peer-reviewed journal and it indeed should be retracted and re-analysed at the very least.\"\n\n'Plausible' mechanism\n\nShoshana Sztal-Mazer, an endocrinologist and expert in bone disease at Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the principle behind OsteoStrong was \"plausible\".\n\nThe company states its system relies on \"osteogenic loading\", which is where force on your bones stimulates them to grow stronger.\n\n\"Physiologically it makes sense,\" Dr Sztal-Mazer said.\n\nBut she agreed there were concerns about the study.\n\n\"It doesn't look like it was rigorously conducted.\n\n\" I think that study was not of a standard that we would normally expect to read in that journal. \"\n\nMost of our bones' internal structure is a little like honeycomb, making them rigid yet somewhat light. (Getty Images: Science Photo Library/STEVE GSCHMEISSNER)\n\nOne of the major sources of bias in the study, according to critics, was allowing patients to choose which group they were in, Professor Fiatarone Singh said.\n\n\"It is well known that people who choose exercise are healthier and at less risk of disease for numerous reasons than sedentary individuals or those who choose a non-exercise control condition when given a choice.\"\n\nWhy building strong bones needs to start early Photo shows Mature woman drinking water from a bottle while exercising. We talked to experts about healthy bones and how to keep them healthy for as long as possible.\n\nIn a statement provided to the ABC, the Endocrine Society, which publishes the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, said: \"We recognise the shortcomings in the research's design and analyses as reported in the online accepted manuscript.\n\n\"Following a detailed editorial assessment, we confirmed the need for significant revisions.\"\n\nThe authors of the study are in the process of submitting a corrected version of the paper, the statement added.\n\nOsteoStrong was approached for comment, but did not respond specifically to concerns raised by Osteoporosis Canada and others.\n\nInstead, Perry Eckert, managing director of OsteoStrong Australia, pointed to recent unpublished research partly sponsored by the company.\n\nAccording to Mr Eckert, the study showed \"a significant improvement\" in bone mineral density and overall strength in 38 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\nCan exercise increase bone density?\n\nHealthy Bones Australia endorses exercise as an important part of reducing bone loss in older age.\n\nBut most trials on exercise programs to strengthen bones are small compared to those studying pharmaceuticals, so the evidence for exercise is not as strong as that for drugs.\n\nThe majority of experts the ABC spoke to were not convinced at this stage exercise could reverse bone mineral density loss that occurs in post-menopausal women, although it might slow down the rate of loss.\n\nWhat is bone mineral density, and how is it tested? Photo shows Woman in a pink dress in a DEXA machine scanning her bone density with a person in a white coat standing nearby. A bone density test can diagnose osteoporosis. So how does it work?\n\nBut despite there being better evidence behind the use of medications to increase bone density, Dr Sztal-Mazer prescribes exercise as well as medications to help stave off bone loss in this age group.\n\n\"Exercise is important as a part of holistic care for osteoporosis and generally for healthy bones.\"\n\nAs well any impact on bone density, the right kind of exercise \u2014 along with adequate vitamin D, calcium and other nutrients \u2014 plays a key role in preventing fractures, Dr Sztal-Mazer said.\n\nExercise can also improve strength and balance, which can also help prevent falls, the main cause of bone fragility fractures.\n\nBut, Dr Sztal-Mazer cautions, guidelines for exercise used by physiotherapists and exercise physiologists to manage osteoporosis suggests a much bigger time commitment is required than that proposed by OsteoStrong.\n\n\" So if somebody's going to propose a 10-minute-a-week quick fix, it really does need to be proven by rigorous studies. \"",

Big tech players have been rumoured to be involved in discussions, including Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nNow, Trump has extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest until September 17. This is despite a law that mandated a sale or shutdown without significant progress.\n\nTrump signed an executive order pushing back Thursday's deadline for 90 days, a step he had previously signalled.\n\nTrump has said he wants to keep the app, which helped him woo young voters in the 2024 presidential election, active in the U.S.\n\nHe has also expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would approve a deal that preserves the app, though it is unclear how significantly the topic has featured in the two countries' ongoing talks to resolve a tariff dispute.\n\n\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available,\" TikTok said in a statement posted on its website.\n\nFor now, looks like Americans shall keep on Tokking.",

Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sandwich. Morgan Roberts \u201cIt\u2019s not really a pyramid, top-down structure. Maybe it would be different if it was chef-owned. But we\u2019re excited to have people bring their ideas in to work on. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the sum of all its parts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe philosophy neatly extends to the main reason (among, it must be said, a bunch of supplementary ones) to check out this Toowong bakery and cafe: its chicken caesar sandwich. Because this is one of the very best chook sangers in the city. Seriously. Related Article Is this sanger Brisbane\u2019s best hangover cure? More about the sandwich in a second. But first, let\u2019s talk about Riser Riser is the creation of Cooney, Kieran Ryan and Duncan McKay, who between them have run, worked, baked at or owned Cup Specialty Roasters, Coffee Supreme, Banneton, The Scratch and Netherworld, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey opened Riser in late 2022 in the storied Queenslander-style shopfront formerly occupied by 85 Miskin Street, and before that Bruno Loubet\u2019s iconic Bruno\u2019s Tables. Riser is tucked away on a back street in bucolic Toowong. Morgan Roberts From the outside, it looks much the same as its suburban restaurant days, but inside it\u2019s transformed, the old ground-floor dining room occupied by an expanded open kitchen and concrete counter and display box. On weekends, it\u2019s the scene of orderly chaos as customers queue around the timber floor and out the door under a shaded patio. What are they queueing for?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelatively quiet during the week, Riser regularly has queues out the door on Saturdays and Sundays. Morgan Roberts Precisely baked danishes, croissants, scrolls and sausage rolls, sure, but also a fabulous chicken caesar sandwich stacked with flavour. Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sandwich As mentioned, the chicken caesar sanger at Riser is a team effort that\u2019s been iterated on at least twice since it was first created (with input from Cooney, Ryan and McKay) by the venue\u2019s original chef, Amos Ilett. Arguably, though, the killer move was the addition of croutons, which was Cooney\u2019s idea. Along with the flecks of bacon, it adds a welcome textural element to the sandwich, and illustrates from the first bite how much thought has gone into this thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article A Hector\u2019s Deli founder is behind one of Brisbane\u2019s tastiest sandwiches Any carb-on-carb crime is avoided via the sourdough sandwich bread \u2014 baked fresh on site and lent a touch more oil than your typical loaf, it\u2019s about as soft as sourdough gets without losing its structure. \u201cAmos was our first sandwich guy and he was really excited about the chicken caesar, and it was instantly awesome,\u201d Cooney says. \u201cBut I said, \u2018Look, I think it needs more crunch.\u2019 And he, being an open-minded, wonderful chef, decided that bread on bread wasn\u2019t the end of the world and that he\u2019d give it a go, and once he did we were all excited about the outcome.\u201d Can\u2019t score a spot in Riser\u2019s pretty backyard? Then our recommendation is to take away to Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens. Morgan Roberts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rest of the sandwich is pretty straightforward: chicken thigh, mesclun (rather than cos lettuce), house-pickled onions, house-made caesar dressing with dill, and a firm wipe of butter on the bread to head off any sogginess. Still, there are neat tweaks under the hood, this time courtesy of current chef Gabriel Escalante-Gafau. \u201cGabriel said, \u2018I want to brine my chicken so it\u2019s just going to be slightly more tender than before,\u2019\u201d Cooney says. \u201cAnd then he added a little bit more punch to the dressing by upping the anchovy and the parmesan side of things.\u201d Riser\u2019s immaculately soft, freshly baked sourdough loaf helps the sandwich avoid any carb-on-carb crime. Morgan Roberts The brined thigh is full of flavour and softer than the breast you\u2019ll find in most sangers, while the extra parmesan and anchovy Escalante-Gafau has added to the dressing kicks up the umami quotient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talk a lot about chef-made sandwiches on Sandwich Watch, and Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sanger eats like one, with a flavour profile that\u2019s strident but balanced. No wonder it\u2019s a bestseller, with a third of its five sandwiches sold every week (out of four regulars and a weekly special) a chicken caesar. Where to get it Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sandwich is $16. You can get one at 85 Miskin Street, Toowong. Maybe avoid peak hour on the weekends. Visiting during the week? The play is to take away to Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens, drive into the park up to the secluded back lake and enjoy your lunch in the company of the inquisitive bush turkeys.

        "text": "Soon it was obvious that Hafner was a bigger fish than first thought. Hafner had form, not so much in his criminal records but in his associates, including the notorious Tony Mokbel. Act One, Scene Two: A bizarre claim in the County Court In 2007, Hafner went to the County Court to argue that a house in Bulleen that had been seized as part of Tony\u2019s impressive real estate portfolio was, in fact, his. He explained that the house had been given to him by his generous grandmother and had somehow been scooped up as part of Mokbel\u2019s $55 million asset portfolio.\n\nAn honest (well dishonest) mistake, he told the County Court. Hafner, you see, was going through a difficult divorce, and he wanted to make sure his partner could not get her hands on half the title. Tony Mokbel leaves court in 2006. Credit: Andrew De La Rue. \u201cMy words were that basically I was having domestics with my missus and, basically, I don\u2019t know what to do with my grandmother\u2019s house, and we ... came to the conclusion that I\u2019d sign it over to him,\u201d he said. The ever-helpful Tony was happy to oblige.\n\nOf course, Mokbel was not in a position to corroborate his mate because at that time he was sitting in a Greek cell having sailed away from Australia on the yacht, Edwena. Unfortunately, an argumentative lawyer for the prosecution suggested Hafner had handed over the house because he owed Mokbel $360,000 and the property was a square-off. The house was valued about $500,000 at the time, and on June 15, 2001, National Australia Bank records show the house was transferred to Tony, who forgave a $320,000 debt and in return transferred $50,000 to Hafner. Mokbel even paid the $17,000 stamp duty to make it all above board. A detective who worked on the Mokbel case said: \u201cTony was the biggest dealer in town, and Darren owed him money from a drug debt. When he couldn\u2019t pay, Tony said, \u2018What have you got?\u2019 and that\u2019s why he signed over his grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d But every cloud has a silver lining, and when the seized house was sold on July 12, 2008, it fetched $625,000, which went to the State Revenue Office.\n\nHafner\u2019s story, unlike the Edwena, sank without trace. County Court judge Michael McInerney dismissed the case, adding: \u201cI do not accept [Hafner] as a credible or reliable witness.\u201d Tony Mokbel fled overseas on the Edwena. Mokbel could afford to be generous because the Hafner debt was chump change. Mokbel, the suburban pizza shop owner, who police described on his file as \u201clacking financial acumen\u201d, was now flying. By 2000, he was planning to build an $18 million, 10-storey \u201cwinged keel\u201d apartment tower over Sydney Road. The plan was to build 120 apartments and townhouses, offices, restaurants, a gym with pool and a four-storey car park on the old Whelan the Wrecker site. No one seemed to wonder how he could generate that sort of money.\n\nHe was also developing 10 units in Templestowe, which he planned to sell for $300,000 each. In 2000, he owned the Brunswick market site and claimed to make $500,000 a year in rent money. His business portfolio was admirably diverse, including investments in shops, cafes, fashion houses, fragrances, restaurants, hotels, nightclubs and land in regional Victoria. He and his companies owned two white vans, two Commodores, a red Audi, a 2000 silver Mercedes, a Nissan Skyline and a red Ferrari Roadster, which he bought in September 1999. He even managed to give his wife a Kilmore pub as part of the family businesses. One of his fashion houses was appropriately named LSD \u2013 apparently an abbreviation for Love of Style and Design. His social network was also varied. It included an MP, a tame bank manager, a bent accountant, a newsagent who gratefully accepted $20,000 a week that Tony invested in Tattslotto, seven jockeys and trainers, and a handful of bookies. One jockey, who was in Mokbel\u2019s car when the drug dealer had a fender-bender with a tradie near the State Library, showed his athletic prowess, opening the door and making a dash for the shadows while a contrite Tony apologised and exchanged details with the second driver. One bookie opened a ghost betting account allowing Mokbel to punt under another name. In one week during the 2002 spring racing carnival, the account turned over $445,000. To Tony, it was just pocket money. The bets were made just weeks after Mokbel was finally granted $1 million bail on the serious drugs charges.\n\nWhen one bookie came to collect $80,000 at Tony\u2019s Port Melbourne home, they walked to Mokbel\u2019s car, where he opened the glove box. While forward-thinking motorists might have a roll of coins for parking meters, the bookie estimated the wad of stashed cash was \u201cat least $300,000\u201d. Loading You might think that having lost a house to Mokbel, Hafner would have sought an alternative income stream. But he was nothing if not persistent. He did branch out, receiving workers\u2019 compensation for several years, doing cash jobs on the side (despite a bad back), then going on the dole for 10 years while selling drugs and using stolen credit cards in a fraud ring. In 10 court hearings he collected 36 convictions.\n\nAct Two, Scene One: The Fawkner cops get the green light The Fawkner detectives built up a case and went to their bosses, and it was at that point Operation Manic was established. Hafner was followed around the state, and soon a case was built that he was the middleman in an international syndicate. Federal police tracked three shipments of pure pseudoephedrine, the key ingredient in speed, flown into Australia from Malaysia, India and Dubai, and identified two other key members, Sarah Baines and Abdul Diallo. At one point, police tracked the crew to a Thomastown service station, where they were to buy a kilogram of speed for $165,000. But, in a familiar story in a drug business that is riddled with rip-offs and no-shows, after the initial meeting, the deal fell through. By September, police had enough to move in and arrest the three.\n\nThe finale: Courtroom justice If everyone has 15 minutes of fame, Baines, 33, must be truly annoyed at how she used hers. When she appeared in court as part of Hafner\u2019s syndicate, the Herald Sun wrote: \u201cA Melbourne party girl who peddled dildos for a living is down on her luck after she was accused of running a high-end drug-trafficking racket.\u201d At court, it was found she had worked in a retail sex shop and ran a cleaning service, and in prison had become an unofficial carer for a disabled inmate. She had been using drugs from her early 20s, and when police raided her Southbank apartment they found evidence of drug transactions, and of the drug, 1,4-butanedoil. Diallo, the court was told, was an African leader in the community, having arrived in Australia as a young refugee from Sierra Leone after his father was murdered.\n\nHafner had been examined in prison. Quoting the psychological report, the judge said: \u201cYou looked and sounded despondent and depressed. You presented as being at least moderately depressed and mildly anxious.\u201d Little wonder when you are looking at a long stretch and could well die in jail When it came to sentencing, no one was spared. County Court judge Richard Maidment gave Diallo 12 years with a minimum of eight years and eight months, while Hafner was sentenced to 12 years with a minimum of eight years and four months. Baines received 11 years with a minimum of seven.",

Matt O\u2019Donohue Previous Slide Next Slide 14.5 / 20 How we score Modern Australian$$$$ The first person you\u2019ll meet at Little Gan\u2019s will probably be Jocelyn Gan, the restaurant\u2019s cordial, all-knowing manager. Those raised with traditional Asian values might feel compelled to call Jocelyn \u201cauntie\u201d, such is the aura of calm, wisdom and you-better-listen-to-me that she (non-threateningly) exudes. However you address Jocelyn, one thing is certain: the First Lady of Little Gan\u2019s goes about her work with the quiet confidence of someone who feels at home. Largely because she is. Before it was Little Gan\u2019s, this was Foo Wah. I don\u2019t know when Foo Wah opened, but I do know that Jocelyn and her husband Steven bought it in 1996 when it was takeaway-only. In the quarter of a century that they ran it, the Gans added a dining room and fleshed out the menu with Chinese cooking deep cuts such as eight treasure duck to accompany crowd-pleasers a la sweet and sour pork. So far, so very suburban Chinese restaurant, right up until Foo Wah closed in mid-2021. Which is when the story takes a turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard, Jocelyn and Steven Gan. Matt O\u2019Donohue Reader, meet the Gans\u2019 youngest son, Richard. Recently returned from Melbourne where he cooked at long-standing beachside fortress Stokehouse, Richard told his parents that he wanted to resurrect the mothballed Foo Wah as a polished, mid-range neighbourhood restaurant serving contemporary cooking \u2013 plot twist number two! \u2013 that locals previously needed to travel for. They agreed, and in Easter 2022, Little Gan\u2019s entered the fray. Richard, like all his siblings, helped out in Foo Wah growing up. Now that he was calling the shots, mum and dad returned the favour (most of Papa Gan\u2019s work, however, happens behind the scenes in the kitchen). Although Richard was based in the Foo Wah kitchen, his job was bagging takeaways rather than preparing them. It wasn\u2019t until his early 20s that he started learning to cook professionally, initially at TAFE, then at the Culinary Institute of America in New York. After graduation, he joined upscale Manhattan restaurants Marea and Vaucluse and learned Italian and French cooking respectively. His time at the latter comes through clearly in the textbook tri-tip beef tartare: bouncy and saucy of body, confidently seasoned and unflinchingly classic. Richard\u2019s attitude towards Italian cooking, however, is less traditional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather, he reckons that handmade pastas and maverick sauces is a great way to lure la cucina vera out of its comfort zone. That pickled shimeji mushrooms are an inspired way to brighten bonbon-like agnolotti packing unctuous beef cheek. That coating toothsome spaghetti with a verdant pur\u00e9e of garlic scapes isn\u2019t sacrilege. And that chilli-spiked linguine yearns for the crunch of golden fried prawn heads: pangratatto for crypto millionaires. Richard Gan (second from right) and his siblings watch Richard\u2019s uncle handling a Tasmanian king crab, Foo Wah, 2000. Courtesy of the Gan family This bowerbird thinking informs other dishes. Korean chilli butter prolongs the crustacean-on-crustacean rapture of juicy tiger prawns paired with a stupid good bisque. The combination of North African harissa and Thai fish sauce makes a compelling argument to let all octopus hold dual citizenship. I\u2019ve eaten plenty of sweet and salty Japanese-style grilled eggplant in my 46-year innings. This was the first that a miso dengaku \u201cside dish\u201d threatened to steal the spotlight from charry steak and juicy pork scotch fillet. Granted, Little Gan\u2019s brand of modern Australian has a pronounced Asian accent, but this isn\u2019t food driven by a mission statement or \u2013 sharp inhale \u2013 \u201cchef\u2019s philosophy\u201d. Instead, these are organically evolved dishes that taste unforced and emblematic of the global village we all live in. Once upon a time, crossover cooking was a byproduct of colonisation. Today, an Instagram DM plus a valid passport are enough to sow the seeds for a win-win collaboration. The comfortable albeit basic dining room shares the kitchen\u2019s cosmopolitan spirit. Framed art on the walls includes pieces from Japan\u2019s Yayoi Kisuma and American painter Edward Hopper, as chosen by Richard\u2019s sister Gillian. (The bijou ceramic vases on the tables, meanwhile, are also made by her).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article The Weekly Special The Weekly Special: Subi cantina opens; truffle season returns; winter escapes to Rotto The clientele reflects the multicultural, upwardly population that inhabits the City of Canning\u2019s golden triangle of Rossmoyne, Willetton and Lynwood. Mum, dad and the two kids are out celebrating exam success. Dates and double dates unfold around me. Lubricated by an armful of BYO fizz, a party of 10 is making the most of its Friday night out. Two straight-talking desserts reiterate Little Gan\u2019s democratic nature. Fluffy Basque cheesecake is great as far as baked cheesecakes go, but lacked the wobble found in the genre\u2019s Premier League specimens. No such qualms with the lithe muscovado tart though, its jiggly mahogany custard made hench by the richness of unrefined cane sugar. While this essay\u2019s subject matter is a single address, the truth is that Foo Wahs and (potential) Little Gan\u2019s exist in almost every postcode. Sometimes they\u2019re a proudly un-gourmet fish and chipper. Other times they\u2019re an increasingly regional-specific eatery where the tables are undressed, but the social fabric is strong. All are in various stages of flux and evolution as they try to balance the needs and aspirations of management with those of the paying public. Success happens when both parties meet in the middle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle Gan\u2019s is a deeply likeable \u2013 and deeply delicious \u2013 example of a multigenerational family restaurant successfully entering its second act. One reason for this smooth transition is longevity. When you convert restaurant years to human years, a quarter of a century is a lifetime. The other, I think, is support. Not just from customers, but from loved ones. Jocelyn and Steven might have hoped Richard would take after them and his eldest brother and become an accountant. But once they realised his dream was somewhere else, they quickly changed theirs. \u201cI would like my children to be themselves and not have any regrets,\u201d says Jocelyn. \u201cI want them to be able to say that they did what they did because they wanted to, not just because mum and dad told them to.\u201d The low-down Atmosphere: a likeable neighbourhood eatery delivering a neat take on the suburban, family-run Chinese restaurant. Go-to dishes: prawn linguine, miso eggplant. Drinks: a surprisingly contemporary cross-section of classic and new-wave wines, although the glass pours aren\u2019t quite as exciting as what\u2019s by the bottle. BYO is also available ($15 per bottle). Cost: about $140 for two people. Good Food reviews are booked anonymously and paid independently.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Roy Masters interviews the NRL coaches, discovering out what drives them and how they approach the modern game. See all 6 stories . When Jason Ryles was appointed head coach of the Eels in July last year, a Parramatta premiership player and former club official sent me a text. Aware of my relationship with Ryles who was then an assistant at the Storm, the ex-player wrote: \u201cTell Jason to surround himself with his own people. That (Parramatta) river isn\u2019t full of eels, it\u2019s full of piranhas. He\u2019ll kill it there if he lives by his sword.\u201d As it transpired, Ryles\u2019s actions suggest he instinctively reached the same conclusion. He installed Nathan Brown, his former head coach at the Dragons, as his No 1 assistant, telling this masthead, \u201cI knew I needed more experience in the coaching group. Brownie was available, he was my coach at the Dragons, had also coached the Knights and Warriors and had only ever been a head coach. He\u2019s also good with the attack. He\u2019s complements me.\u201d Ryles, 46, also wielded his own sword when he moved on fullback and captain Clint Gutherson and veteran prop Reagan Campbell-Gillard, as well as sidelining regular forwards Shaun Lane and Ryan Matterson. Ryles says, \u201cThe changes needed to happen but happened naturally. The fullback and front rower got longer and better money deals elsewhere. I also knew I had to regenerate the roster. The roster was older and not as fast and athletic as I wanted. I didn\u2019t know how it would all work out but it went well in the end.\u201d Jason Ryles with assistant coach Nathan Brown. Credit: NRL Photos It\u2019s addition by subtraction. By releasing highly paid older players, Ryles has money in the salary cap to reward a greater number of talented youngsters. The downside is a team which can\u2019t stay the distance with the top clubs, as demonstrated in the last two losses, 18-10 to the Panthers and 30-12 to the Bulldogs. \u201cWe can\u2019t hang in there for the long period,\u201d Ryles said. \u201cWe have a lot of young kids here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyles\u2019s approach to players is similar to the legendary coach Jack Gibson who won Parramatta\u2019s first premiership, 34 years after the club\u2019s entry into the top league, a drought exceeded by the current one where the Eels last grand final victory was in 1986. Gibson coached by osmosis, the imperceptible assimilation of knowledge. While Ryles is not Gibson, he does encourage players to figure things out for themselves. As one of his colleagues said of Ryles time in Melbourne, \u201cHe likes to plant the seed and let it germinate in the player\u2019s mind.\u201d Jack Gibson during his time coaching Parramatta. Credit: Fairfax For example, I asked how he treated Zac Lomax who was signed by former coach Brad Arthur for less money than he was receiving at the Dragons because he was a winger wanting to play centre. Ryles started him there in the opening round, a humiliating 56-18 loss to the Storm but Lomax has starred for NSW as a winger and will be compensated for the money lost by leaving the Dragons via the NSWRL\u2019s payment of $30,000 for each Origin match. \u201cI let him work that out for himself,\u201d Ryles said of a talented player who confused himself and must now realise he is a winger, not a centre. As for the warning to Ryles that the Parramatta river is \u201cfull of piranhas\u201d - suggesting a club with marrow-deep grudges and a witches brew of ancient hatreds - Ryles makes it clear he quarantines himself from what are now called \u201cexternal factors\u201d and is a player\u2019s coach. \u201cThe biggest thing for me is the support I get from Mitch (Moses) and Junior Paulo. I keep them in the loop on what I plan to do, while always getting their opinion but not compromising my relationship with the other players.\u201d Ryles has a finely tuned sensitivity meter. He knows a coach must never under-estimate the petty jealousies in the dressing room. Clubs, such as the Rabbitohs, have imploded by the coach investing too much power in two senior players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGibson faced a simmering mutiny when he joined Parramatta in 1981 after the club had failed to recover from the 1977 grand final loss to the Dragons - then captained by Steve Edge.

He\u2019s the cornerstone of where we are going.\u201d Although a player\u2019s coach, Ryles is not deaf to any murmurs outside the dressing room. He says of chief executive Jim Sarantinos and football manager Mark O\u2019Neill, \u201cAt times I can sense their nervousness at some of the decisions I\u2019ve made but they\u2019ve supported me.\u201d Of the possibility of piranha sightings in the Parramatta river, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve experienced challenges in a couple of areas but the club knew it was ready for change.\u201d Ryles\u2019s journey to the top is different from all the assistants who have been working up the NRL\u2019s food chain to head coach. Wests Tigers Benji Marshall, like Brown, went straight from playing to head coach and others, such as the Sharks Craig Fitzgibbon, had a long apprenticeship. Ryles spent the interim between playing and being an NRL assistant at the Storm and Roosters as captain/coach of the Wollongong Red Devils, 2014-15. He had his own team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was one of the hardest things I have ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it, if you are a front rower. But it helped me enormously because I had to do everything, from putting the witches hats out to dropping players. I had to do all that while being captain, calling the shots and putting my head into the scrum.\u201d An NRL assistant is excused from performing one of a head coach\u2019s most difficult duties \u2013 staring a player in the eye and demoting him to reserve grade. \u201cI\u2019ve drawn on that Wollongong experience when dropping players,\u201d he says, perhaps explaining why he can sensitively deliver bad news in an era when players resemble Ming vases \u2013 precious commodities that shatter when dropped. Ryles\u2019s empathy with players is also born of his own disappointments. \u201cWayne (Bennett) moved me on (from the Dragons in 2009) and then I got moved on by the Roosters (in 2011).\u201d In the middle year (2010), the Dragons won the premiership, beating his Roosters. He then joined the Storm but a hamstring injury ruled him out of Melbourne\u2019s 2012 victory. Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy with Ryles in 2020. Credit: Getty Images He went to Melbourne, he says, \u201cto play with Smithy.\u201d If learning under hooker Cameron Smith, the NRL\u2019s most capped player made Melbourne the place to be, it is also the club to be tutored by, as he says, \u201cthe greatest coach ever\u201d (Craig Bellamy). To follow Bellamy who has \u201cput all the systems in place\u201d was the principal reason he agreed to return to the club as a head coach in waiting, after rejecting an offer to coach the Dragons. The Dragons claim to have cooled on Ryles when, during negotiations for a five-year contract, the possibility of a pay-out after year three was raised. Ryles says, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that. Maybe that\u2019s more to do with George (Mimis, his manager). The reason I went back to Melbourne was it was there. They thought Craig was getting closer to the end. If Melbourne wasn\u2019t on offer, I would have gone to the Dragons.\u201d As it transpired, Bellamy will coach into his 24th season in 2026.\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: AAP / Joel Carrett An offer to defer some of the legal bill in exchange for Deeming's guaranteed preselection and Pesutto swearing off trying to return as leader for three years was rebuffed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to party members late on Thursday, Victorian Liberal president Philip Davis said the money would be paid directly to Deeming.\n\n\n\n\n\nPesutto will be required to repay the loan at market-rate interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavis said the deal would avert a by-election and allow the Liberals' parliamentary party to focus on the issues that matter to the Victorian community.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering parliament on Thursday morning, Pesutto was upbeat about the committee agreeing to his loan request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tonight's an opportunity to square [the issue] off and put it all behind us,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDeeming sceptical of d\u00e9tente\n\nDeeming, who was expelled from the party room before being welcomed back in December, was sceptical it would end the infighting that has engulfed the party since March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I assume that they will continue with their quest to try to annihilate me,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeeming said the party could \"do what they like\" but she would take any support of Pesutto as a \"direct rebukement (sic)\" of the court judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn social media posts made following news of the bailout, Deeming wrote: \"They failed to protect her when she was attacked .... They punished her for defending herself ... this is what institutional abuse looks like.\"\n\n\n\n'We've put the line in the sand'\n\nVictorian Opposition leader Brad Battin was among those who voted to support the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've actually put the line in the sand on that and now we really have to focus on moving forward,\" Battin told ABC Radio Melbourne on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattin urged his fellow MPs to stop the infighting to present a credible alternative to the Victorian Labor government, in power for all but four years since 1999.\n\n\n\nFollowing news of former Victorian Liberal leader John Pesutto's bailout, current leader Brad Battin said: \"I really believe now is our opportunity to ensure each and every one of my members has a think about what they've wanted to get into parliament for, and it wasn't to be in opposition,\" he said. Source: AAP / Diego Fedele Earlier, he warned Deeming and Pesutto to \"smell the roses\" if either woke up on Friday morning unhappy with the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nTime is running out for Battin to unite the Liberals before the next state election in November 2026.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "From droughts to fires, cyclones, and floods, Australia has been hit with a series of devastating extreme weather events, and the financial burden is becoming increasingly heavy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a new Climate Change Authority (CCA) report, back-to-back disasters have cost the Australian economy $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost is projected to rise to $8.7 billion annually by 2050 without strong action, the report stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Home safe: National leadership in adapting to a changing climate report examines the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and calls for national leadership on climate action.\n\n\n\nThe economic cost of natural disasters and extreme weather\n\nThe Insurance Council of Australia estimates bushfires, cyclones, and floods are costing Australian homeowners around $4 billion each year, from a combination of both insured and uninsured losses, mental health impacts, and loss of housing and employment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts are rising as the climate changes and hazards become more frequent and severe, with regions and homes that were previously unaffected now becoming at risk, according to the Climate Change Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change Authority chair Matt Kean said: \"Our homes are our sanctuaries \u2014 and the biggest financial investment most Australians will ever make.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Millions of Australian homes now face escalating risks from climate change. Devastating flooding on the NSW mid-north coast last month is the latest example, but won't be the last.\"\n\n\n\nThe report referenced recent research from the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA), the Treasury, and The McKell Institute into the costs of residential building damage resulting from extreme weather. The research found the cost to residential buildings is $2 billion a year for cyclones, $1.5 billion a year for floods and $486 million a year for bushfires.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs these events become more frequent, the cost of insurance premiums has also increased. The CCA examined research from the Actuaries Institute and ICA, which found insurance claims for ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred and the North Queensland floods exceeded $1.2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs cost of living pressures also increase, 15 per cent of Australian households experienced home insurance affordability stress in 2024, according to the research.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate-related disasters can also have a lasting impact on property prices in affected areas, and the report projects climate change could wipe over $500 billion off the Australian property market by 2030.\n\n\n\nProperty damage is not the only economic impact of climate change and extreme weather events.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside housing costs, Australians are also facing costly impacts to their physical health, mental health, displacement, and impacts on their ability to work and study, the report said.\n\n\n\nCan climate change costs be reduced?\n\nThe CCA has called on the government to take steps to reduce the risks and costs associated with climate-related extreme weather events.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report's recommendations include making appropriate investments in infrastructure and services, ensuring standards, laws and regulations are fit-for-purpose for a changing climate, and equipping Australians with the information and resources to improve their decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch by the CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, found every dollar invested in climate adaptation or disaster risk reduction saves $2 to $11 in recovery costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Authorities will need to review and tighten building codes. Parts of coastal Queensland and WA not now covered by cyclone construction standards may need to be, and soon,\" Kean said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are the kinds of practical steps we can take to make Australia more resilient in a changing climate.\"\n\n\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said work is underway across all levels of government and the private sector to improve the resilience of infrastructure, services, and the built environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government released the National Climate Risk Assessment first pass in March 2024, and is now progressing to the full release of Australia's first National Climate Risk Assessment as a matter of priority, in addition to a corresponding National Adaptation Plan,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The National Adaptation Plan will represent a step change in the Australian government's response to climate change. It establishes, for the first time, a framework for adapting to the physical climate risks that are nationally significant.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Climate Risk Assessment identified 56 nationally significant climate risks facing Australia, along with a subset of 11 priority risks that require further analysis. It is being used by the government to examine the impacts and risks to Australia from climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent planning and investments in infrastructure and services include the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy and Plan, the Disaster Ready Fund, and the Queensland Betterment Funds program.\n\n\n\n",

Skelton has subsequently won three European Cups and captained his country in a World Cup, but the Lions still feel different.\n\n\u201cI was very raw, I didn\u2019t understand the magnitude of the tour, as I do now, with all the experience I\u2019ve had.

Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sandwich. Morgan Roberts \u201cIt\u2019s not really a pyramid, top-down structure. Maybe it would be different if it was chef-owned. But we\u2019re excited to have people bring their ideas in to work on. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the sum of all its parts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe philosophy neatly extends to the main reason (among, it must be said, a bunch of supplementary ones) to check out this Toowong bakery and cafe: its chicken caesar sandwich. Because this is one of the very best chook sangers in the city. Seriously. Related Article Is this sanger Brisbane\u2019s best hangover cure? More about the sandwich in a second. But first, let\u2019s talk about Riser Riser is the creation of Cooney, Kieran Ryan and Duncan McKay, who between them have run, worked, baked at or owned Cup Specialty Roasters, Coffee Supreme, Banneton, The Scratch and Netherworld, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey opened Riser in late 2022 in the storied Queenslander-style shopfront formerly occupied by 85 Miskin Street, and before that Bruno Loubet\u2019s iconic Bruno\u2019s Tables. Riser is tucked away on a back street in bucolic Toowong. Morgan Roberts From the outside, it looks much the same as its suburban restaurant days, but inside it\u2019s transformed, the old ground-floor dining room occupied by an expanded open kitchen and concrete counter and display box. On weekends, it\u2019s the scene of orderly chaos as customers queue around the timber floor and out the door under a shaded patio. What are they queueing for?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelatively quiet during the week, Riser regularly has queues out the door on Saturdays and Sundays. Morgan Roberts Precisely baked danishes, croissants, scrolls and sausage rolls, sure, but also a fabulous chicken caesar sandwich stacked with flavour. Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sandwich As mentioned, the chicken caesar sanger at Riser is a team effort that\u2019s been iterated on at least twice since it was first created (with input from Cooney, Ryan and McKay) by the venue\u2019s original chef, Amos Ilett. Arguably, though, the killer move was the addition of croutons, which was Cooney\u2019s idea. Along with the flecks of bacon, it adds a welcome textural element to the sandwich, and illustrates from the first bite how much thought has gone into this thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article A Hector\u2019s Deli founder is behind one of Brisbane\u2019s tastiest sandwiches Any carb-on-carb crime is avoided via the sourdough sandwich bread \u2014 baked fresh on site and lent a touch more oil than your typical loaf, it\u2019s about as soft as sourdough gets without losing its structure. \u201cAmos was our first sandwich guy and he was really excited about the chicken caesar, and it was instantly awesome,\u201d Cooney says. \u201cBut I said, \u2018Look, I think it needs more crunch.\u2019 And he, being an open-minded, wonderful chef, decided that bread on bread wasn\u2019t the end of the world and that he\u2019d give it a go, and once he did we were all excited about the outcome.\u201d Can\u2019t score a spot in Riser\u2019s pretty backyard? Then our recommendation is to take away to Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens. Morgan Roberts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rest of the sandwich is pretty straightforward: chicken thigh, mesclun (rather than cos lettuce), house-pickled onions, house-made caesar dressing with dill, and a firm wipe of butter on the bread to head off any sogginess. Still, there are neat tweaks under the hood, this time courtesy of current chef Gabriel Escalante-Gafau. \u201cGabriel said, \u2018I want to brine my chicken so it\u2019s just going to be slightly more tender than before,\u2019\u201d Cooney says. \u201cAnd then he added a little bit more punch to the dressing by upping the anchovy and the parmesan side of things.\u201d Riser\u2019s immaculately soft, freshly baked sourdough loaf helps the sandwich avoid any carb-on-carb crime. Morgan Roberts The brined thigh is full of flavour and softer than the breast you\u2019ll find in most sangers, while the extra parmesan and anchovy Escalante-Gafau has added to the dressing kicks up the umami quotient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talk a lot about chef-made sandwiches on Sandwich Watch, and Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sanger eats like one, with a flavour profile that\u2019s strident but balanced. No wonder it\u2019s a bestseller, with a third of its five sandwiches sold every week (out of four regulars and a weekly special) a chicken caesar. Where to get it Riser\u2019s chicken caesar sandwich is $16. You can get one at 85 Miskin Street, Toowong. Maybe avoid peak hour on the weekends. Visiting during the week? The play is to take away to Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens, drive into the park up to the secluded back lake and enjoy your lunch in the company of the inquisitive bush turkeys.

        "text": "Soon it was obvious that Hafner was a bigger fish than first thought. Hafner had form, not so much in his criminal records but in his associates, including the notorious Tony Mokbel. Act One, Scene Two: A bizarre claim in the County Court In 2007, Hafner went to the County Court to argue that a house in Bulleen that had been seized as part of Tony\u2019s impressive real estate portfolio was, in fact, his. He explained that the house had been given to him by his generous grandmother and had somehow been scooped up as part of Mokbel\u2019s $55 million asset portfolio.\n\nAn honest (well dishonest) mistake, he told the County Court. Hafner, you see, was going through a difficult divorce, and he wanted to make sure his partner could not get her hands on half the title. Tony Mokbel leaves court in 2006. Credit: Andrew De La Rue. \u201cMy words were that basically I was having domestics with my missus and, basically, I don\u2019t know what to do with my grandmother\u2019s house, and we ... came to the conclusion that I\u2019d sign it over to him,\u201d he said. The ever-helpful Tony was happy to oblige.\n\nOf course, Mokbel was not in a position to corroborate his mate because at that time he was sitting in a Greek cell having sailed away from Australia on the yacht, Edwena. Unfortunately, an argumentative lawyer for the prosecution suggested Hafner had handed over the house because he owed Mokbel $360,000 and the property was a square-off. The house was valued about $500,000 at the time, and on June 15, 2001, National Australia Bank records show the house was transferred to Tony, who forgave a $320,000 debt and in return transferred $50,000 to Hafner. Mokbel even paid the $17,000 stamp duty to make it all above board. A detective who worked on the Mokbel case said: \u201cTony was the biggest dealer in town, and Darren owed him money from a drug debt. When he couldn\u2019t pay, Tony said, \u2018What have you got?\u2019 and that\u2019s why he signed over his grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d But every cloud has a silver lining, and when the seized house was sold on July 12, 2008, it fetched $625,000, which went to the State Revenue Office.\n\nHafner\u2019s story, unlike the Edwena, sank without trace. County Court judge Michael McInerney dismissed the case, adding: \u201cI do not accept [Hafner] as a credible or reliable witness.\u201d Tony Mokbel fled overseas on the Edwena. Mokbel could afford to be generous because the Hafner debt was chump change. Mokbel, the suburban pizza shop owner, who police described on his file as \u201clacking financial acumen\u201d, was now flying. By 2000, he was planning to build an $18 million, 10-storey \u201cwinged keel\u201d apartment tower over Sydney Road. The plan was to build 120 apartments and townhouses, offices, restaurants, a gym with pool and a four-storey car park on the old Whelan the Wrecker site. No one seemed to wonder how he could generate that sort of money.\n\nHe was also developing 10 units in Templestowe, which he planned to sell for $300,000 each. In 2000, he owned the Brunswick market site and claimed to make $500,000 a year in rent money. His business portfolio was admirably diverse, including investments in shops, cafes, fashion houses, fragrances, restaurants, hotels, nightclubs and land in regional Victoria. He and his companies owned two white vans, two Commodores, a red Audi, a 2000 silver Mercedes, a Nissan Skyline and a red Ferrari Roadster, which he bought in September 1999. He even managed to give his wife a Kilmore pub as part of the family businesses. One of his fashion houses was appropriately named LSD \u2013 apparently an abbreviation for Love of Style and Design. His social network was also varied. It included an MP, a tame bank manager, a bent accountant, a newsagent who gratefully accepted $20,000 a week that Tony invested in Tattslotto, seven jockeys and trainers, and a handful of bookies. One jockey, who was in Mokbel\u2019s car when the drug dealer had a fender-bender with a tradie near the State Library, showed his athletic prowess, opening the door and making a dash for the shadows while a contrite Tony apologised and exchanged details with the second driver. One bookie opened a ghost betting account allowing Mokbel to punt under another name. In one week during the 2002 spring racing carnival, the account turned over $445,000. To Tony, it was just pocket money. The bets were made just weeks after Mokbel was finally granted $1 million bail on the serious drugs charges.\n\nWhen one bookie came to collect $80,000 at Tony\u2019s Port Melbourne home, they walked to Mokbel\u2019s car, where he opened the glove box. While forward-thinking motorists might have a roll of coins for parking meters, the bookie estimated the wad of stashed cash was \u201cat least $300,000\u201d. Loading You might think that having lost a house to Mokbel, Hafner would have sought an alternative income stream. But he was nothing if not persistent. He did branch out, receiving workers\u2019 compensation for several years, doing cash jobs on the side (despite a bad back), then going on the dole for 10 years while selling drugs and using stolen credit cards in a fraud ring. In 10 court hearings he collected 36 convictions.\n\nAct Two, Scene One: The Fawkner cops get the green light The Fawkner detectives built up a case and went to their bosses, and it was at that point Operation Manic was established. Hafner was followed around the state, and soon a case was built that he was the middleman in an international syndicate. Federal police tracked three shipments of pure pseudoephedrine, the key ingredient in speed, flown into Australia from Malaysia, India and Dubai, and identified two other key members, Sarah Baines and Abdul Diallo. At one point, police tracked the crew to a Thomastown service station, where they were to buy a kilogram of speed for $165,000. But, in a familiar story in a drug business that is riddled with rip-offs and no-shows, after the initial meeting, the deal fell through. By September, police had enough to move in and arrest the three.\n\nThe finale: Courtroom justice If everyone has 15 minutes of fame, Baines, 33, must be truly annoyed at how she used hers. When she appeared in court as part of Hafner\u2019s syndicate, the Herald Sun wrote: \u201cA Melbourne party girl who peddled dildos for a living is down on her luck after she was accused of running a high-end drug-trafficking racket.\u201d At court, it was found she had worked in a retail sex shop and ran a cleaning service, and in prison had become an unofficial carer for a disabled inmate. She had been using drugs from her early 20s, and when police raided her Southbank apartment they found evidence of drug transactions, and of the drug, 1,4-butanedoil. Diallo, the court was told, was an African leader in the community, having arrived in Australia as a young refugee from Sierra Leone after his father was murdered.\n\nHafner had been examined in prison. Quoting the psychological report, the judge said: \u201cYou looked and sounded despondent and depressed. You presented as being at least moderately depressed and mildly anxious.\u201d Little wonder when you are looking at a long stretch and could well die in jail When it came to sentencing, no one was spared. County Court judge Richard Maidment gave Diallo 12 years with a minimum of eight years and eight months, while Hafner was sentenced to 12 years with a minimum of eight years and four months. Baines received 11 years with a minimum of seven.",

Those raised with traditional Asian values might feel compelled to call Jocelyn \u201cauntie\u201d, such is the aura of calm, wisdom and you-better-listen-to-me that she (non-threateningly) exudes. However you address Jocelyn, one thing is certain: the First Lady of Little Gan\u2019s goes about her work with the quiet confidence of someone who feels at home. Largely because she is. Before it was Little Gan\u2019s, this was Foo Wah. I don\u2019t know when Foo Wah opened, but I do know that Jocelyn and her husband Steven bought it in 1996 when it was takeaway-only. In the quarter of a century that they ran it, the Gans added a dining room and fleshed out the menu with Chinese cooking deep cuts such as eight treasure duck to accompany crowd-pleasers a la sweet and sour pork. So far, so very suburban Chinese restaurant, right up until Foo Wah closed in mid-2021. Which is when the story takes a turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard, Jocelyn and Steven Gan. Matt O\u2019Donohue Reader, meet the Gans\u2019 youngest son, Richard. Recently returned from Melbourne where he cooked at long-standing beachside fortress Stokehouse, Richard told his parents that he wanted to resurrect the mothballed Foo Wah as a polished, mid-range neighbourhood restaurant serving contemporary cooking \u2013 plot twist number two! \u2013 that locals previously needed to travel for. They agreed, and in Easter 2022, Little Gan\u2019s entered the fray. Richard, like all his siblings, helped out in Foo Wah growing up. Now that he was calling the shots, mum and dad returned the favour (most of Papa Gan\u2019s work, however, happens behind the scenes in the kitchen). Although Richard was based in the Foo Wah kitchen, his job was bagging takeaways rather than preparing them. It wasn\u2019t until his early 20s that he started learning to cook professionally, initially at TAFE, then at the Culinary Institute of America in New York. After graduation, he joined upscale Manhattan restaurants Marea and Vaucluse and learned Italian and French cooking respectively. His time at the latter comes through clearly in the textbook tri-tip beef tartare: bouncy and saucy of body, confidently seasoned and unflinchingly classic. Richard\u2019s attitude towards Italian cooking, however, is less traditional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather, he reckons that handmade pastas and maverick sauces is a great way to lure la cucina vera out of its comfort zone. That pickled shimeji mushrooms are an inspired way to brighten bonbon-like agnolotti packing unctuous beef cheek. That coating toothsome spaghetti with a verdant pur\u00e9e of garlic scapes isn\u2019t sacrilege. And that chilli-spiked linguine yearns for the crunch of golden fried prawn heads: pangratatto for crypto millionaires. Richard Gan (second from right) and his siblings watch Richard\u2019s uncle handling a Tasmanian king crab, Foo Wah, 2000. Courtesy of the Gan family This bowerbird thinking informs other dishes. Korean chilli butter prolongs the crustacean-on-crustacean rapture of juicy tiger prawns paired with a stupid good bisque. The combination of North African harissa and Thai fish sauce makes a compelling argument to let all octopus hold dual citizenship. I\u2019ve eaten plenty of sweet and salty Japanese-style grilled eggplant in my 46-year innings. This was the first that a miso dengaku \u201cside dish\u201d threatened to steal the spotlight from charry steak and juicy pork scotch fillet. Granted, Little Gan\u2019s brand of modern Australian has a pronounced Asian accent, but this isn\u2019t food driven by a mission statement or \u2013 sharp inhale \u2013 \u201cchef\u2019s philosophy\u201d. Instead, these are organically evolved dishes that taste unforced and emblematic of the global village we all live in. Once upon a time, crossover cooking was a byproduct of colonisation. Today, an Instagram DM plus a valid passport are enough to sow the seeds for a win-win collaboration. The comfortable albeit basic dining room shares the kitchen\u2019s cosmopolitan spirit. Framed art on the walls includes pieces from Japan\u2019s Yayoi Kisuma and American painter Edward Hopper, as chosen by Richard\u2019s sister Gillian. (The bijou ceramic vases on the tables, meanwhile, are also made by her).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article The Weekly Special The Weekly Special: Subi cantina opens; truffle season returns; winter escapes to Rotto The clientele reflects the multicultural, upwardly population that inhabits the City of Canning\u2019s golden triangle of Rossmoyne, Willetton and Lynwood. Mum, dad and the two kids are out celebrating exam success. Dates and double dates unfold around me. Lubricated by an armful of BYO fizz, a party of 10 is making the most of its Friday night out. Two straight-talking desserts reiterate Little Gan\u2019s democratic nature.

No such qualms with the lithe muscovado tart though, its jiggly mahogany custard made hench by the richness of unrefined cane sugar. While this essay\u2019s subject matter is a single address, the truth is that Foo Wahs and (potential) Little Gan\u2019s exist in almost every postcode. Sometimes they\u2019re a proudly un-gourmet fish and chipper. Other times they\u2019re an increasingly regional-specific eatery where the tables are undressed, but the social fabric is strong. All are in various stages of flux and evolution as they try to balance the needs and aspirations of management with those of the paying public. Success happens when both parties meet in the middle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle Gan\u2019s is a deeply likeable \u2013 and deeply delicious \u2013 example of a multigenerational family restaurant successfully entering its second act. One reason for this smooth transition is longevity. When you convert restaurant years to human years, a quarter of a century is a lifetime. The other, I think, is support. Not just from customers, but from loved ones. Jocelyn and Steven might have hoped Richard would take after them and his eldest brother and become an accountant. But once they realised his dream was somewhere else, they quickly changed theirs. \u201cI would like my children to be themselves and not have any regrets,\u201d says Jocelyn. \u201cI want them to be able to say that they did what they did because they wanted to, not just because mum and dad told them to.\u201d The low-down Atmosphere: a likeable neighbourhood eatery delivering a neat take on the suburban, family-run Chinese restaurant. Go-to dishes: prawn linguine, miso eggplant. Drinks: a surprisingly contemporary cross-section of classic and new-wave wines, although the glass pours aren\u2019t quite as exciting as what\u2019s by the bottle. BYO is also available ($15 per bottle). Cost: about $140 for two people. Good Food reviews are booked anonymously and paid independently.

When Jason Ryles was appointed head coach of the Eels in July last year, a Parramatta premiership player and former club official sent me a text. Aware of my relationship with Ryles who was then an assistant at the Storm, the ex-player wrote: \u201cTell Jason to surround himself with his own people. That (Parramatta) river isn\u2019t full of eels, it\u2019s full of piranhas. He\u2019ll kill it there if he lives by his sword.\u201d As it transpired, Ryles\u2019s actions suggest he instinctively reached the same conclusion. He installed Nathan Brown, his former head coach at the Dragons, as his No 1 assistant, telling this masthead, \u201cI knew I needed more experience in the coaching group. Brownie was available, he was my coach at the Dragons, had also coached the Knights and Warriors and had only ever been a head coach. He\u2019s also good with the attack. He\u2019s complements me.\u201d Ryles, 46, also wielded his own sword when he moved on fullback and captain Clint Gutherson and veteran prop Reagan Campbell-Gillard, as well as sidelining regular forwards Shaun Lane and Ryan Matterson. Ryles says, \u201cThe changes needed to happen but happened naturally. The fullback and front rower got longer and better money deals elsewhere. I also knew I had to regenerate the roster. The roster was older and not as fast and athletic as I wanted. I didn\u2019t know how it would all work out but it went well in the end.\u201d Jason Ryles with assistant coach Nathan Brown. Credit: NRL Photos It\u2019s addition by subtraction. By releasing highly paid older players, Ryles has money in the salary cap to reward a greater number of talented youngsters. The downside is a team which can\u2019t stay the distance with the top clubs, as demonstrated in the last two losses, 18-10 to the Panthers and 30-12 to the Bulldogs. \u201cWe can\u2019t hang in there for the long period,\u201d Ryles said. \u201cWe have a lot of young kids here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyles\u2019s approach to players is similar to the legendary coach Jack Gibson who won Parramatta\u2019s first premiership, 34 years after the club\u2019s entry into the top league, a drought exceeded by the current one where the Eels last grand final victory was in 1986. Gibson coached by osmosis, the imperceptible assimilation of knowledge. While Ryles is not Gibson, he does encourage players to figure things out for themselves. As one of his colleagues said of Ryles time in Melbourne, \u201cHe likes to plant the seed and let it germinate in the player\u2019s mind.\u201d Jack Gibson during his time coaching Parramatta. Credit: Fairfax For example, I asked how he treated Zac Lomax who was signed by former coach Brad Arthur for less money than he was receiving at the Dragons because he was a winger wanting to play centre. Ryles started him there in the opening round, a humiliating 56-18 loss to the Storm but Lomax has starred for NSW as a winger and will be compensated for the money lost by leaving the Dragons via the NSWRL\u2019s payment of $30,000 for each Origin match. \u201cI let him work that out for himself,\u201d Ryles said of a talented player who confused himself and must now realise he is a winger, not a centre. As for the warning to Ryles that the Parramatta river is \u201cfull of piranhas\u201d - suggesting a club with marrow-deep grudges and a witches brew of ancient hatreds - Ryles makes it clear he quarantines himself from what are now called \u201cexternal factors\u201d and is a player\u2019s coach. \u201cThe biggest thing for me is the support I get from Mitch (Moses) and Junior Paulo. I keep them in the loop on what I plan to do, while always getting their opinion but not compromising my relationship with the other players.\u201d Ryles has a finely tuned sensitivity meter. He knows a coach must never under-estimate the petty jealousies in the dressing room. Clubs, such as the Rabbitohs, have imploded by the coach investing too much power in two senior players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGibson faced a simmering mutiny when he joined Parramatta in 1981 after the club had failed to recover from the 1977 grand final loss to the Dragons - then captained by Steve Edge. A veteran Parramatta player predicted \u201cJack Gibson will f--- this club\u201d, after Gibson recruited Edge as captain, rather than giving the honour to an Eel. Gibson\u2019s Parramatta won three successive premierships with Edge as skipper. Eels halfback Mitchell Moses. Credit: Getty Images Ryles has similar faith in his captain, saying of Moses, \u201cWe got all the options out of his contract. He\u2019s done until the end of 2029. He\u2019s the cornerstone of where we are going.\u201d Although a player\u2019s coach, Ryles is not deaf to any murmurs outside the dressing room. He says of chief executive Jim Sarantinos and football manager Mark O\u2019Neill, \u201cAt times I can sense their nervousness at some of the decisions I\u2019ve made but they\u2019ve supported me.\u201d Of the possibility of piranha sightings in the Parramatta river, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve experienced challenges in a couple of areas but the club knew it was ready for change.\u201d Ryles\u2019s journey to the top is different from all the assistants who have been working up the NRL\u2019s food chain to head coach. Wests Tigers Benji Marshall, like Brown, went straight from playing to head coach and others, such as the Sharks Craig Fitzgibbon, had a long apprenticeship. Ryles spent the interim between playing and being an NRL assistant at the Storm and Roosters as captain/coach of the Wollongong Red Devils, 2014-15. He had his own team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was one of the hardest things I have ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it, if you are a front rower. But it helped me enormously because I had to do everything, from putting the witches hats out to dropping players. I had to do all that while being captain, calling the shots and putting my head into the scrum.\u201d An NRL assistant is excused from performing one of a head coach\u2019s most difficult duties \u2013 staring a player in the eye and demoting him to reserve grade. \u201cI\u2019ve drawn on that Wollongong experience when dropping players,\u201d he says, perhaps explaining why he can sensitively deliver bad news in an era when players resemble Ming vases \u2013 precious commodities that shatter when dropped. Ryles\u2019s empathy with players is also born of his own disappointments. \u201cWayne (Bennett) moved me on (from the Dragons in 2009) and then I got moved on by the Roosters (in 2011).\u201d In the middle year (2010), the Dragons won the premiership, beating his Roosters. He then joined the Storm but a hamstring injury ruled him out of Melbourne\u2019s 2012 victory. Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy with Ryles in 2020. Credit: Getty Images He went to Melbourne, he says, \u201cto play with Smithy.\u201d If learning under hooker Cameron Smith, the NRL\u2019s most capped player made Melbourne the place to be, it is also the club to be tutored by, as he says, \u201cthe greatest coach ever\u201d (Craig Bellamy). To follow Bellamy who has \u201cput all the systems in place\u201d was the principal reason he agreed to return to the club as a head coach in waiting, after rejecting an offer to coach the Dragons. The Dragons claim to have cooled on Ryles when, during negotiations for a five-year contract, the possibility of a pay-out after year three was raised. Ryles says, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that. Maybe that\u2019s more to do with George (Mimis, his manager). The reason I went back to Melbourne was it was there. They thought Craig was getting closer to the end. If Melbourne wasn\u2019t on offer, I would have gone to the Dragons.\u201d As it transpired, Bellamy will coach into his 24th season in 2026.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Locals have known about the secret site for over a century, but interest has quietly been growing online.\n\nAn Aussie prospector has pulled gold nuggets out of the ground, and found old relics like a silver-plated bobby pin, and even old coins. But the most remarkable thing he\u2019s ever stumbled across is an ancient ruin in the bush.\n\n\u201cLocals have always kept quiet about it, and it\u2019s pretty remote,\u201d prospector Bart van Uyen told Yahoo News after an expedition to photograph the site. The structure\u2019s symmetrical brick walls tower over three metres from the ground, almost resembling an Aztec temple. However, it's never had a mythological use \u2014 its purpose was purely industrial.\n\nBack in 1887 when the walls were built, a large wheel was placed between them, and when it spun, it powered the Bendigo and Fryers Goldmining Company\u2019s large stamp battery \u2014 a device used for crushing ore to extract gold.\n\nRelated: \u26b1\ufe0f Aussie prospector reveals secret maps to find fortune\n\nHow the prospector stumbled upon the ruin\n\nYou won\u2019t find the Mopoke Gully water wheel in tourist brochures. But locals living close by, in a tiny town south of Castlemaine in Victoria, know where to find it. And in recent years, a few online posts have popped up about its history. Yahoo has chosen not to publicise its exact location.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBart has been visiting the ruin for a few years, and it has a special place in his heart. When he first saw it, much of the state had been locked down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and stumbling upon something so unexpected while he was searching for gold left him \u201camazed\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was travelling around doing some prospecting. I tend to go down every dirt track possible, and it was just sitting there,\u201d he said.\n\nBart spoke to Yahoo News after returning from a trip to photograph the Mopoke Gully water wheel. Source: Golden Triangle Nugget Hunter\n\nThe structure is similar to the better-known Garfield water wheel, which attracts history buffs from around the country. That one is in a state park, while the Mopoke Gully water wheel is on private land which Bart has permission to enter. Both structures were built in 1887, but the wheels themselves were disassembled in the early 1900s.\n\nIt\u2019s seen better days, and it\u2019s covered in moss, but that\u2019s all part of its charm. \u201cStanding inside it is awesome, it\u2019s such an impressive thing. There\u2019s gorgeous bushland around it. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see something like that still intact,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBart likes to imagine what life was like back in the gold rush, and their work ethic and sense of adventure leave him in awe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quiet there now. But I just imagine the hustle and bustle around that place when it was going,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople risked life and limb to come to Victoria to dig for gold. People died, others made money, some went broke.\u201d\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

        "text": "Cameras have been silently monitoring driver behaviour since their installation, but now they're being flicked into enforcement mode.\n\nAverage speed cameras will be switched into enforcement mode in two high-risk NSW spots from July 1. Source: AAP/Daily Telegraph/NSW govt\n\nDrivers in the country's most populous state are being urged to slow down and take notice, with a major shift in road safety enforcement just days away.\n\nFrom July 1, average speed cameras at two NSW locations will switch from trial to active enforcement mode, and the consequences for speeding could be severe, with fines of up to $2,959 for light vehicles and the loss of six demerit points.\n\nThese cameras calculate a vehicle\u2019s average speed over a monitored road section rather than capturing speed at a single point. The system works by recording a vehicle\u2019s entry and exit times at two points, then calculating whether the average speed exceeds the limit.\n\nThe cameras are positioned on two key routes: The Pacific Highway, along a 15 km stretch between Kew and Lake Innes on the NSW Mid North Coast, and on the Hume Highway, along a 16 km stretch between Coolac and Gundagai in the state's south. These are the only average speed cameras in NSW to date that will lead to fines for light vehicles, all other locations around the state monitor the speed of heavy vehicles only.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTransport for NSW (TfNSW) says the aim is to \"prevent speeding and reduce lives lost and serious injuries on the road network\". According to NSW legislation, penalties vary depending on the severity of the offence and the posted speed limit.\n\nA breakdown of NSW speeding fines for light vehicles\n\nExceed speed limit by 10 km/h or less\n\nUnrestricted licence: $145 fine, 1 demerit point\n\nLearner or P1/P2 licence: $145 fine, 4 demerit points\n\nExceed speed limit by over 10 km/h but not more than 20 km/h\n\nUnrestricted licence: $334 fine, 3 demerit points\n\nLearner or P1/P2 licence: $334 fine, 4 demerit points\n\nExceed speed limit by over 20 km/h but not more than 30 km/h\n\nAll drivers: $574 fine, 4 demerit points\n\nExceed speed limit by over 30 km/h but not more than 45 km/h\n\nAll drivers: $1,097 fine, 5 demerit points\n\nExceed speed limit by over 45 km/h\n\nAll drivers: $2,959 fine, 6 demerit points\n\nThese penalties apply outside of double demerit periods. Fines are also higher if drivers are caught speeding in a school zone. It's understood that fine amounts are also likely to increase from July 1, in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The current list of speeding penalties in NSW can be viewed here.\n\nExperts say average speed cameras are one of the most effective tools for reducing speeding-related crashes. \"We\u2019re committed to making NSW roads safer. Average speed safety cameras encourage drivers to stick to the speed limit over longer distances, not just when they see a camera,\" a TfNSW spokesperson said.\n\nWhile these cameras have been silently monitoring driver behaviour since their installation, from July 1, they\u2019ll start issuing fines.\n\nLawyer says average speed cameras target 'everyday driver'\n\nBut prominent road lawyer Hayder Shkara told Yahoo the move may target the \"everyday driver\" who drifts between five and 10km/h over the limit while \"overtaking or distracted\" and not the hoon putting lives at risk.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Average speed enforcement doesn\u2019t target the hoon doing 130 in a 60 zone who brakes when they see a cop,\" he said. \"This can penalise minor, unintentional lapses, especially when driving for long distances,\" he told Yahoo News. \"The blanket approach lacks nuance\u2014something you\u2019d expect more of if the goal is truly road safety rather than punishing drivers.\"\n\n\"I also think the average speed cameras may encourage drivers to become overly fixated on maintaining speed rather than focusing on overall safety, like adjusting to conditions or anticipating hazards.\"\n\nLetters have already gone out to residents in affected areas, warning them of the change. The NSW government has also published notices across its website and social media, but many drivers remain unaware. With enforcement beginning July 1, motorists are advised to check their regular routes and ensure they\u2019re sticking to the limit.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
