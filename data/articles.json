(ABC News: Mark Bennett)\n\nA Regional Australia Institute (RAI) report on the country's housing crisis published in August showed the town's rental vacancy rate was 0.15 per cent in December 2024, the second-tightest rental market in regional Australia.\n\nThe shortage of local housing stock is not a new issue, with the ABC reporting on how the crisis affected staffing at childcare centres in March 2024.\n\nIn 2025, childcare centres in the town of about 15,000 people are reporting waitlists of more than 100 children.\n\nA Shire of Esperance survey of local businesses in January found an additional 60 jobs could be filled immediately if accommodation was available.\n\nThe shire believes it has a solution, with a \"shovel-ready\" 20-unit key worker accommodation project to ease the pressure of the worst rental vacancy rate in the state.\n\nRental prices have also increased due to the high demand.

(ABC Esperance: Andrew Williams)\n\n\"It has a massive impact across the whole lot of it, even directly limiting population growth, which is what you need in an area to get business expansion, and then the region's ability to attract and retain talent.\"\n\nThis is supported by the RAI's report, which highlighted \"resounding feedback from consultations\" that a lack of housing for workers was a key barrier to overall regional economic growth and development.\n\n\"Without sufficient housing, filling those jobs and realising [a] region's economic potential will remain a major challenge,\" the report stated.\n\n'Shovel-ready' silver bullet\n\nCr Chambers said the situation would not improve without help from the state government, with options including releasing state-owned land in the town and covering the costs of power, water and sewage infrastructure to new blocks.\n\nCr Chambers said the shire had a \"shovel-ready solution\" called the Key Worker Accommodation Project, which would be the quickest way to ease the issue with an estimated 24-month build time, but it needed the state government's help.\n\nThe proposed location of the development is on the corner of Council Place and Jane Street in Esperance. (Supplied: Shire of Esperance)\n\nThe development would add 20 units to the heart of town, with a mix of two and three-bedroom configurations, but would need a $7.73 million state government contribution on top of $2.3 million from the shire.\n\nRAI head researcher Simon Pryor said state governments should set up regional sub-targets for new homes.\n\n\"Housing estate developments in the regions are often smaller than in the cities, so from a unit cost perspective they look more expensive,\" Mr Pryor said.\n\nSimon Pryor's research for Regional Australia Institute found 0.15 per cent of homes were available to rent in Esperance. (Supplied)\n\n\"Financing can be a challenge in regions for a whole range of reasons, so there is definitely a role for state governments \u2026 to help dissolve some of those financing challenges.\"\n\nProject funding to be assessed\n\nThe shire has applied for project funding through a Department of Communities (DOC) funding pool, which supports a range of housing delivery types, including key worker and service worker accommodation.\n\nSubmissions for this DOC funding stream closed on September 2.\n\nHousing and Works Minister John Carey would not comment on whether the state government had specific plans to address Esperance's 0.15 per cent rental vacancy rate, but did highlight efforts it had made towards tackling the state's housing crisis.\n\nJohn Carey says the Labor government has invested $5.8 billion in housing and homelessness measures since 2021. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"Our government recently introduced stamp duty exemptions and concessions changes that are more generous for regional WA, and mean first-home buyers in Esperance will save on stamp duty for homes valued up to $750,000,\" he said.\n\n\"The latest state budget funded the $25 million Regional Housing Support Fund, which will provide grants of up to $5 million to support new housing and land supply across regional WA.\"\n\nThe state's $80 million Infrastructure Development Fund supports up-front development costs associated with connections to water, electricity and sewerage infrastructure.\n\nMr Carey would not confirm whether the government would consider financially supporting Esperance's Workers Accommodation Project, but said it would continue to collaborate with the shire to find suitable funding sources.",

        "text": "Despite having some of the most talked-about names in the AFLW on their roster, Richmond currently sits in 17th place after losing their opening four matches of the season.\n\nAnd those defeats have not been narrow ones.\n\nThe Tigers went down to Essendon by 15 points, the Western Bulldogs by 21 points and Sydney in the opening round by 20 points, with their heaviest defeat coming last weekend, a 37-point hammering by Melbourne.\n\nAFLW young guns putting competition on notice Photo shows Zippy Fish of the Swans kicks the ball . Sydney superstar and co-captain Chloe Molloy says \"the talent is insane\" in the new crop of AFLW players who have debuted over the weekend.\n\nThis is despite a list containing the likes of league best and fairest Monique Conti, former number-one draft pick Ellie McKenzie, Katie Brennan, Caitlin Greiser and promising teenager Sierra Grieves.\n\nThey are now just one of two AFLW sides winless so far this season along with GWS, which finished 16th last year.\n\nGiven the brevity of the competition, a 0-4 start could mean its season is over before the side has really had a chance to click into gear.\n\nBut this is a team that made finals last year. So, what has happened?\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nAFLW analyst and commentator Gemma Bastiani says Richmond's biggest issue is not being able to convert forward 50 entries into goals, often due to poor decision-making and a lack of chemistry among their forwards.\n\nThis year, they are averaging two fewer goals per game than last, kicking an average of 26.8 points for, compared to 40.8 last season.\n\nDespite getting the ball forward often, they are turning just 9.3 per cent of inside 50 entries into goals \u2014 down from 16.8 per cent last year.\n\n\"These numbers are reflective of really poor decision-making in the front half,\" Bastiani told ABC Sport.\n\n\"It's not about skill because we saw last year the players that they have in that forward line can kick big scores, can take control of games.\n\n\"But the way they're choosing to play is not allowing them to do that this year \u2014 and teams are defending them better\".\n\nThe Tigers are not able to convert any of their territory into points. (Getty: Morgan Hancock)\n\nIn their round 2 loss against the Western Bulldogs, Richmond had zero marks inside 50.\n\nThey are also easier to score against this year, conceding 50 points per game vs 34.1 last season.\n\n\"So it's not like they've gone into a really defensive mode and that's meant that their scoring has dried up as well,\" Bastiani said.\n\n\"They're actually leaking nearly three goals more per game than they were last year.\n\n\"So not only are they converting poorly, they're then allowing it to go straight back up the other end and hurt them.\"\n\n'A lot of talent'\n\nRichmond are being figured out too easily by their opposition and they are not able to adapt in-game, which is a by-product, in part, of an over-reliance on a few senior players on the park.\n\n\"I think they are absolutely lacking depth, but not so much depth in talent. I think they have a lot of talent on the list.

        "text": "In this rural community, sploshing through a muddy football oval is the highlight of the year.\n\nSince 2019, residents from Victoria's South Gippsland region have donned their best gumboots to compete in the annual Gumboot Gift.\n\nLast week, competitors braved the wind and rain to keep the country tradition alive.\n\nLoading...\n\nAn annual tradition\n\nThe Gumboot Gift is a 120-metre foot race held each year in the Victorian town of Korumburra, as part of the South Gippsland Dairy and Farming Expo.\n\nExpo project secretary Deanne Kennedy said it all began with a dinner table conversation.\n\n\"We were brainstorming novelty events we could include, and somebody came up with the idea of a gumboot race,\" she said.\n\n\"Six years later, it's become a much-loved and very competitive event.\"\n\nDeanne Kennedy says the Gumboot Gift has gained quite a following. (ABC Rural: Faith Tabalujan)\n\nMs Kennedy said it brought the community together, attracting everyone from dairy farmers to Lions Club members.\n\n\"It fits so well with our farming theme and, even though some runners aren't farmers themselves, they're rural people and really value agriculture,\" she said.\n\n'Authentic' boots only\n\nGift competitors must be over 18 and fit to run 120 metres.\n\nHandicaps are incorporated into the race, with previous winners starting 10m behind and older runners given an age-based head start.\n\nOrganisers say the event has become \"very competitive\" over the years. (ABC Rural: Faith Tabalujan)\n\nBut Ms Kennedy said there was one other crucial rule.\n\n\"Only authentic gumboots are allowed,\" she said.\n\n\"That's to say, ones you'd wear on a dairy or beef farm in the middle of a wet Gippsland winter.\"\n\nMs Kennedy said it levelled the playing field.\n\n\"We had to change the rules a couple of years ago because people came in slimline or ankle-height boots,\" she said.\n\n\" But proper gumboots are much harder to run in, so it makes for a more amusing race. \"\n\nA rule that allows \"authentic\" gumboots only levels the playing field. (ABC Rural: Faith Tabalujan)\n\nFamiliar faces\n\nLeongatha resident Sarah Lewis knows this better than most.\n\nMs Lewis won this year's women's Gumboot Gift, but said it was not her first rodeo.\n\n\"I've raced each year since the gift started in 2019, but we didn't have races in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic,\" she said.\n\nSarah Lewis (middle) is the winner of this year's women's Gumboot Gift. (ABC Rural: Faith Tabalujan)\n\nMs Lewis said this year, the weather was not on her side.\n\n\"We raced at the Korumburra footy oval, which was super muddy and slippery, and there was plenty of fog around too,\" she said.\n\n\"But that made it extra fun.\"\n\nA worthy cause\n\nKoo Wee Rup dairy farmer and first-time gift participant Simon Finger won the men's event, and agreed it was a tough race.\n\n\"It was quite a wet track, so I just had to make sure my feet were well-planted,\" he said.\n\nMen's event winner Simon Finger (centre) says the wet track made for a tricky race. (ABC Rural: Faith Tabalujan)\n\n\"Last year I didn't run because of a shoulder injury, but this year I entered the older age bracket alongside a bunch of other local dairy farmers.\"\n\nAs this year's Gumboot Gift champions, Ms Lewis and Mr Finger took home a share of $4,000 in prize money, donated by local businesses.\n\nMr Finger entered the race knowing how he would use the money if he won.\n\n\"My mate's wife has cancer, so it'll go towards supporting them,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what I was running for.\"\n\n'Just do it'\n\nMs Kennedy said the Gumboot Gift was a tradition worth keeping.\n\n\"We'll continue to fine-tune the rules just to make sure that they're fair, but we have every intention of keeping the gift alive,\" she said.\n\n\"It's incredibly popular and everyone loves watching on, so why not?\"\n\nAccording to Ms Lewis, anyone can give it a shot.\n\n\"Just do it, because it's so much fun whether you win, lose, or fall over,\" she said.\n\n\"And everyone at the finish line walks away with a smile on their face.\"",

        "text": "A survey of women in Canberra about the state of their health and wellbeing has revealed large gaps in access and affordability, as well as the staggering statistic that almost half of respondents felt doctors didn't take them seriously.\n\nMegan Phipps isn't even the slightest bit surprised.\n\nShe was 20, a university student and otherwise fit and healthy when she started experiencing debilitating abdominal pain five years ago.\n\nIt was so crippling, Ms Phipps was struggling to eat, sleep or study.\n\n\"I couldn't go out with my friends, I had to decline social invitations, I had to withdraw from university,\" Ms Phipps said.\n\n\"It was just so pervasive.\"\n\nMs Phipps was dismissed by her GP when battling debilitating abdominal pain, which would eventually be diagnosed as endometriosis. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nMs Phipps's general practitioner ordered testing for appendicitis, which came back clear.\n\n\"When those tests came back fine, my GP told me it must just be stress,\" she said.\n\n\"He said, 'Take a deep breath, you're a young woman \u2014 I think you should do some stress management techniques. Try yoga, try journalling. If it's still bad, come back in a month.'\n\n\"I was so shocked. It was really jarring to have my experience dismissed.\"\n\nOwn research led to medical diagnosis\n\nThe pain did not subside and Ms Phipps spent the month doing her own research.\n\nShe returned to the GP's office and asked whether endometriosis could provide an explanation for her symptoms.\n\nIt was that point he referred her to a female GP, who then referred her to a gynaecologist.\n\nEndometriosis meant Ms Phipps was in constant pain and made every-day tasks like cooking difficult. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nNine months later, Ms Phipps had laparoscopic surgery, which confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis and removed the tissue that was causing her severe pain.\n\n\"After the healing process from the surgery, it was like day and night,\" she said.\n\n\" I woke up and, for the first time in nine months, I wasn't in pain \u2014 I was in disbelief. \"\n\nThe pain returned last year. The endometriosis had spread to Ms Phipps' bowel, causing a partial obstruction.\n\nShe was told by three specialists in Canberra that the surgery she needed, which required a gynaecologist and colorectal surgeon, wasn't available in the ACT.\n\n\"They basically said, 'We don't have the resources for that. You'll have to head to Sydney',\" she said.\n\n\"So, I started googling specialists in Sydney.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nMs Phipps is not alone in her endometriosis experience.\n\nThe results of this year's Women's Health Matters survey shows \"overall low levels of satisfaction\" with endometriosis healthcare in the ACT.\n\nFor the survey, 1,319 responses were collected on topics including health services, mental health, sexual health, pregnancy and birth, as well as family and sexual violence.\n\nAmong the respondents with endometriosis, 50 per cent said they were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the care they received.\n\nA lonely and unsupported journey\n\nAnother area of healthcare that women felt was lacking in Canberra was in perimenopause and menopause treatment.\n\nThe survey asked respondents who had sought support, information or healthcare in relation to either condition in the past two years whether they got what they needed.\n\n\"A significant proportion \u2014 36 per cent \u2014 reported only getting some of what they needed,\" the report states.\n\n\"While 25 per cent reported getting hardly any or none of what they needed.\"\n\nFelicity Brazil was suffering through a myriad of perimenopause symptoms \u2014 night sweats, hot flushes, brain fog and anxiety \u2014 in 2020.\n\nFelicity Brazil says finding a GP who specialises in women's health makes a big difference. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"And I'd just find myself crying,\" Ms Brazil said.\n\n\" I'd be at work and be in tears, and I remember thinking, 'This just isn't me'. \"\n\nThe wait for an appointment with her usual GP was longer than Ms Brazil was willing to endure, so she booked in with a different doctor at the same practice.\n\n\"It was a younger woman who hadn't been through it and really didn't know much about it,\" Ms Brazil.\n\n\"She was having to look up online how to help.\n\n\"It was really hard because I really needed something that would help.\"\n\nMs Brazil's dog Bruno became a constant source of support and companionship in what was otherwhile a lonely medical journey. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nMs Brazil walked away from the appointment with a prescription for anti-depressants and a new-found realisation of the importance of seeing a GP who specialised in women's health.\n\n\"What I know now \u2014 you can't talk about menopause in a 15-minute chat,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a whole-of-wellbeing discussion because it's physical and emotional.\"\n\nMs Brazil turned to a specialist GP at the Menopause Clinic at Sexual Health and Family Planning, which currently has a three-month wait for initial appointment.\n\nThat GP recommended a pelvic floor exam, which confirmed Ms Brazil was perimenopausal and also showed an abnormality on one of her ovaries.\n\n\"Within six weeks, I had both of my ovaries and my fallopian tubes out, and I also had a total hysterectomy,\" Ms Brazil said.\n\n\"I then went straight into menopause.\"\n\nMs Brazil started the Menopause Cafe in Canberra last year after finding a lack of support available for women at that stage of life. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nAlthough she was supported medically, Ms Brazil found herself with little social support to navigate this next phase of her life.\n\nThe experience motivated her to start the Menopause Cafe in Canberra, which meets monthly and offers a safe space for women to share their experiences in an effort to destigmatise menopause.\n\nGPs under pressure\n\nMs Brazil said the cafe has given her the opportunity to hear other women's stories of navigating the healthcare system.\n\nBut it quickly made her realise that her journey was among the more positive ones.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking,\" she said.\n\n\"The majority haven't had a good experience, especially initially \u2014 some have had medical professionals refuse to give them prescriptions that would alleviate their symptoms because they don't believe in it.\n\n\" Other women have told me that they've been showing evidence to their GP and gynaecologist of their symptoms and still not being believed. \"\n\nIndeed, another concerning finding was that 45 per cent of respondents felt doctors were taking them \"only somewhat seriously or not at all seriously\" when explaining symptoms or health concerns.\n\nThe survey results are difficult for Dr Laura Chapman to hear, but not to understand.\n\nCanberra GP Dr Laura Chapman specialises in chronic disease management. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nThe Canberra GP specialises in chronic disease management, and said women often landed in her office after having disappointing experiences elsewhere.\n\n\"Often women will come to see us saying they have felt dismissed or not taken seriously or they've had symptoms that have been really challenging to manage without being offered solutions,\" Dr Chapman said.\n\n\" Sometimes people will come here quite desperate. \"\n\nThe conditions Dr Chapman's patients most commonly complain about have been previously mismanaged or ignored: endometriosis, perimenopause and menopause.\n\nDr Chapman said the gender split of medical professionals was \"still a very real factor\" but added that those conditions were also difficult to diagnose and manage in a standard 15-minute appointment.\n\n\"The pressure that a lot of GPs are under to get through patients quickly has a huge impact,\" Dr Chapman said.\n\n\"It means that they don't have the time to do a deep-dive into symptoms and figure out what's going on.\n\n\"If a GP is seeing 30 or 40 patients a day, with that volume and the time pressures attached to that, it's really hard for them to know each patient and appreciate what might be a shift away from their baseline.\"\n\nAffordability also an issue\n\nChief executive of Women's Health Matters Lauren Anthes. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nLauren Anthes is the chief executive of Women's Health Matters, the independent think tank behind the survey, which was also conducted in 2023.\n\nShe said, just as it did two years ago, this year's survey has brought these ongoing issues around affordability and access to healthcare for women into sharp focus.\n\nThe survey revealed around one in five respondents went without medical care or medication as a result of not having enough money.\n\nMs Anthes said that was a really critical piece of information to use when advocating for change.\n\n\"It's a hugely significant statistic,\" Ms Anthes said.\n\n\"One of the key things will be looking at how we work with government and service providers to make services more affordable.\n\n\"And how we ensure that we're identifying those people who can't afford services and how we're making them available.\"\n\nThe need for holistic care\n\nThe survey also highlighted the prevalence of sexual and family violence in the ACT \u2014 39 per cent of women had experienced some form of violence at some point in their life, 40 per cent indicated they had experienced workplace sexual harassment and 27 per cent reported experiencing some form of domestic violence.\n\nMs Anthes said those figures should send a strong message to the ACT government about the need to adequately fund \"a whole system, not just parts of a system\".\n\nMs Anthes says the government needs to work on providing holistic care across the entire health system. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"We need to make sure we're funding our frontline crisis services and we're doing that adequately while also looking more broadly than that,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that we've got a range of people who experience violence that may not ever go to a crisis service but who will be accessing healthcare services.\n\n\"That's why this dataset is so important \u2014 because we can actually look at people who experience violence and also their experiences of the health system.\n\n\"We really need to focus on a whole system in terms of violence prevention.\"\n\nWhen asked what their advice to women would be, Ms Phipps, Dr Chapman and Ms Brazil all said similarly: keep pushing until you get what you need.\n\n\"My advice would be to stick by your guns,\" Dr Chapman said.\n\n\"If you've got symptoms that are causing distress and disability, you are absolutely entitled to have a conversation with a healthcare provider about appropriate, affordable, safe treatment options.",

        "text": "No Australian has ever won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, the third of cycling's three grand tours.\n\nBut Jai Hindley, one of just two Australians alongside Cadel Evans to ever win one of the sport's premier three-week stage races, is still contemplating glory at this year's event.\n\n\"For sure you race to win bike races, simple as that,\" Hindley told CyclingNews during the race's second rest day on Monday.\n\n\"At the moment the race is for the podium, but in the end it's a grand tour. It's three weeks long and it can be very unpredictable.\n\n\"I'm feeling pretty good, and in general, the Vuelta is still to play for.\"\n\nThe 2022 Giro d'Italia champion currently sits in fourth place overall, 3 minutes 10 seconds behind two-time Tour de France winner Jonas Vingegaard, with Jo\u00e3o Almeida 48 seconds behind.\n\nJonas Vingegaard, left, has been shadowing Jo\u00e3o Almeida, right, to ensure he loses no time, while Jai Hindley looms in the background. (Getty Images: Dario Belingheri)\n\nHowever, the 29-year-old West Australian is looming large just 32 seconds behind third-placed Tom Pidcock in the race for the podium.\n\nAlthough a top-three spot is the primary goal, Hindley still holds high hopes for what promises to be an intensely challenging final week.\n\n\"The podium would be really nice, and the team also deserve that,\" Hindley said.\n\n\"But it's not a given nor would be easy to do. It'll be a big fight every day to the finish.\"\n\nSeven stages remain in the race, with a total of 777.4km and 13,643m of climbing to endure, including a crucial 27.2km individual time trial in Valladolid.\n\nHindley's Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team also has 21-year-old Italian phenom Giulio Pellizzari as a backup plan, the leader in the white jersey competition for the race's best young rider sitting in sixth overall.\n\nJai Hindley has the support of 21-year-old Giulio Pellizzari in the mountains.

We're fighting for that and the white jersey is a plus,\" he said after Sunday's 15th stage.\n\nBut counting for the Australian is his uncanny ability to excel in the final week of grand tours \u2014 Hindley's 2022 Giro triumph was built off the back of a phenomenal stage win the day before the final rest day, after which he chipped away at the narrow lead held by Richard Carapaz until he finally cracked the Ecuadorian on the final 3km of the brutal ascent to Passo Fedaia on the penultimate stage.\n\n\"I think I'm growing into the race and feeling good, and there are great vibes within the team,\" Hindley said prior to the 12th stage.\n\n\"The feeling is good, but it's step by step. I also feel like I'm growing into the race \u2026 that's why I like grand tours so much, I guess.\"\n\nHindley feels that the \"decisive\" stage will be the final mountain test up the Bola del Mudo, a 12.3km climb at an average of 8.6 per cent on Saturday.\n\nBut after three tough years, Hindley is just thrilled to be fighting it out at the sharp end of the race.\n\n\"If I'm honest, it's been a long time since I've been at this level,\" Hindley said.\n\n\"It's great to be back at the pointy end of a grand tour.\"\n\nThe Vuelta has taken the riders up some brutal climbs in its 80th edition. (Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\nHindley hasn't enjoyed much luck in grand tours since his 2022 triumph in pink \u2014 his heavy fall and abandonment at the Giro this year a case in point \u2014 but the target was always the Vuelta this year, a race that has proved to be rich ground for Australian success in the past few years.\n\nIn 2024, Ben O'Connor finished second after a record-breaking stint in the leader's red jersey, following on from Jack Haig's surprise third place in 2021.\n\nCadel Evans also finished third at the Vuelta back in 2009.\n\nThere has been other peripheral successes in the year's final grand tour too.\n\nAustralia a cycling powerhouse Photo shows Kaden Groves and Jay Vine wave on a podium Australia has just had arguably its most successful grand tour performance in 14 years, winning two classifications jerseys and claiming second overall.\n\nSprinter Kaden Groves won the points jersey in both of the last two editions, while Jay Vine is the defending king of the mountain.\n\nVine is also leading the race for the polka dot jersey this year, a jersey also won by Michael Storer in 2021.\n\n\"I really enjoy racing the Vuelta, you know? It's a pretty sick race,\" Hindley said.\n\n\"The last couple of years I was normally meant to do it, but I was coming out of the Tour [de France] in a body bag.\n\n\"So I was really happy, super motivated to do it this year. It was the big goal.\"\n\nSo can Hindley upset the odds and mount a serious challenge for the red jersey as the race heads to Madrid?\n\nVingegaard may be in the box seat, but with a brutal Tour de France lingering in his legs and a reduced Visma Lease-a-Bike team making for an oddly conservative strategy and a UAE Team Emirates XRG squad battling on multiple fronts and perhaps not fully investing in Almeida, it's not beyond the realms of possibility.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Gout Gout's star is rising even faster than his legs can carry him, and with a world championships debut on the horizon, managing expectations is going to be difficult.\n\nOf the 87-member squad picked by Australian Athletics for the championships in Tokyo, 21 of the athletes are aged 21 or younger.\n\nGout is joined by fellow young sprinters Torrie Lewis and Caleb Law, while Lachlan Kennedy \u2014 who ran a sub-10-second 100m in May \u2014 had to withdraw from the championships with a back injury.\n\nMiddle-distance runners Cameron Myers, Claudia Hollingsworth and Peyton Craig, long jumper Delta Amidzovski and race walker Elizabeth McMillen are also athletes 21 or younger who will wear the green and gold in Tokyo.\n\nThey may not all be household names yet but, if they follow their current trajectories, many can be.\n\nIt is the job of Australian Athletics head of high performance Andrew Faichney to get the best out of this group and give them the maximum opportunity to succeed internationally.\n\nOlyslagers wins another Diamond League Photo shows Nicola Olyslagers clenches her fists and smiles after winning the high jump in front of the Zurich Opera House. Nicola Olyslagers confirms her status as perhaps Australia's greatest gold medal chance at next month's athletics world championships.\n\n\"I think that we have got an extraordinary generation of athletes that are coming through,\" Faichney told ABC Sport.\n\n\"Their performances are really, really good at such a young age.\"\n\nVeteran running coach Nic Bideau has been around long enough to know that this is a generational group of young athletes.\n\n\"I've been involved in athletics at that top level since the 90s, through a long time, and I've never seen it so good,\" Bideau told ABC Sport.\n\nGout is ranked the 16th best men's 200m sprinter in the world, and Kennedy has the same rank in the men's 100m.\n\nMyers, 19, has already set a men's national record in the mile and has the junior indoor world records for the 1,500m and mile.\n\nAmidzovski, 19, won gold in the women's long jump and bronze in the 100m hurdles at last year's World Athletics Under 20 Championships in Lima. Men's 800m runner Craig, 20, won silver in Lima and made the semifinals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDelta Amidzovski won gold for Australia in the women's long jump at the Under 20 World Championships in 2024. (AAP: Con Chronis)\n\nLast year's under-20 championships were Australia's best ever, with the team winning a total of 14 medals.\n\nFaichney told ABC Sport said preparation was the key to Australia's success in Lima, and it led to magnificent results.\n\n\"We put a real focus in preparing our athletes as the best that they could be and we went in probably the best prepared I would say of all of the countries,\" Faichney said.\n\n\"Individually, each of them are fantastic athletes, and I think what we're trying to do is set up a system and a program which is going to enable them and their coaches to do the best that they can.\"\n\nThese rising stars on the track join Australia's established performers, who won seven medals at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nNina Kennedy, who has withdrawn from the World Championships due to injury, won gold in the women's pole vault. Jessica Hull (women's 1,500m) and Nicola Olyslagers (women's high jump) won silver medals.\n\nJemima Montag (women's 20km race walk), Montag/Rhydian Cowley (relay race walk) Eleanor Patterson (women's high jump) and Matthew Denny (men's discuss) won bronze to complete the most successful track and field outing for Australia since the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne.\n\nThose athletes can all be expected to compete for medals at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 and some will still be around for Brisbane in 2032.\n\nFaichney said that experienced group would be complemented by the young stars, who by then would be in their prime.\n\n\"I think over the next seven or eight years, we're going to have fantastic success in the major championships through that whole group of our athletes,\" Faichney said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nNic Bideau coached Cathy Freeman and Olympians Stewart McSweyn and Genevieve Gregson, and is currently coaching world championship selections Georgia Griffiths and Sarah Billings.\n\nHe said Australia's success was due to \"lots of little things\".\n\n\"It's never just one magical reason that's causing it,\" he said.\n\nBideau cited the changing demographics of Australia, increased professionalism, better coaching and high-performance support, and the chance to compete at the Brisbane Olympics as some of the reasons why we were seeing more young athletes competing on the world stage.\n\nThen there are the intangible ingredients like the belief that comes from seeing others succeed.\n\nCompetition and Brisbane 2032 spurring on Australia's rising stars\n\nTorrie Lewis is ranked 17th in the women's 200m and is a four-time national champion at just 20.\n\nShe is part of this current crop of late teens and early-20s athletes who are inspiring each other to greater ambitions, with the lure of a home Olympics.\n\n\"It's almost like we're pushing each other, like, 'If I can do it, you can do it too,' and giving each other confidence,\" Lewis said.\n\nTorrie Lewis says the success of her peers has inspired a belief within herself. (AAP: Richard Wainwright)\n\nLewis recalled then 18-year-old Calab Law making the semifinals of the men's 200m at the 2022 World Championships as a moment when fellow athletes inspired her to believe.\n\n\"I remember watching that like, 'Oh my God. That's crazy, like so good.' Then you think you can also do it as well,\" she said.\n\nThe younger athletes' success is pushing them, and their Australian teammates, to higher levels of competition and performance.\n\nIt has created an environment that breeds success, according to Bideau.\n\n\"It used to be that if you were a good athlete, it wasn't that difficult to make the Australian team,\" Bideau said.\n\n\"Now you can be a world-class athlete capable of winning Diamond League races, like Linden Hall is, and still be up again back against the wall to try and make the Australian team.\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush. The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.\n\n\"If you are on the Australian team, the expectation now is that you're good enough to make the final.\"\n\nWhile Australia's young crop have been motivated and inspired by their peers, the athletes are also taking responsibility for their performance.\n\nAccording to Faichney, the current generation are all highly driven and high achievers.\n\n\"It's such an individual sport, so you have to be so intrinsically motivated to be at the very top level,\" Faichney said.\n\n\"There's a number of athletes that we've had over the over the journey who, for varying reasons, probably had talent that could have taken them a little bit further, but other impacts in their life, whether that be injury, whether that be life circumstances, whether that be motivational factors, mean that they don't quite get there.\"\n\nThe Tokyo World Championships is just the first step in the journey that culminates in LA in 2028, but it may also be the moment that Australian athletics truly takes centre stage.",

Chief executive Nuno Matos says the bank is going to ensure the \"indefensible and deeply disappointing\" emails are not repeated.\n\nANZ will book restructuring charges of around $560 million, before tax, with the final details of the costs to be included in its financial results in early November.\n\nIn recent weeks, the ANZ boss issued an apology for automated redundancy emails sent to staff, which he described as \"indefensible and deeply disappointing\".\n\nSome retail banking staff facing job cuts received an email in August, telling them of their redundancies before they were officially informed.\n\nThe emails had been sent by mistake, an ANZ spokesperson said at the time, and redundancy meetings were made quickly.",

        "text": "Key Points French parliament ousted Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, rejecting his deficit plan.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is resisting calls for snap elections.\n\nThe next government's most pressing task will be to pass a budget and solve France's mounting debt crisis.\n\nFrance's parliament has brought down the government over its plans to tame the ballooning national debt, deepening a political crisis that is weakening the euro zone's second-largest economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliticians voted to oust Prime Minister Francois Bayrou and his minority government with 364 votes against the veteran centrist politician and 194 in his favour.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, who is facing calls from the opposition to dissolve parliament and resign, will instead hunt for his fifth prime minister in less than two years. His office said he would appoint one in the next few days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next government's most pressing task will be to pass a budget, the same challenge Francois Bayrou faced when he took office nine months ago. Securing the backing of a very divided parliament will be equally hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have the power to bring down the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,\" Bayrou told the parliament before losing the confidence vote.\n\n\n\n\"Reality will remain relentless: expenses will continue to rise, and the burden of debt, already unbearable, will grow heavier and more costly,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBayrou will tender his resignation on Tuesday local time, his office said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had called the confidence vote to try to win parliamentary support for his strategy to lower a deficit that stands at nearly double the European Union's three per cent ceiling, and to start tackling a debt pile equivalent to 114 per cent of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut opposition parties were in little mood to rally behind his planned savings of \u20ac44 billion ($78.5 billion) in next year's budget, with an election for Macron's successor looming in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This moment marks the end of the agony of a phantom government,\" far-right leader Marine Le Pen said, pushing for a snap parliamentary election, which Macron has so far ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Macron is now on the front line facing the people. He too must go,\" Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the hard-left France Unbowed, said on X.\n\n\n\nWho could be France's next prime minister?\n\nA lengthy period of political and fiscal uncertainty risks undermining Macron's influence in Europe at a time when the United States is talking tough on trade and security, and war is raging in Ukraine on Europe's eastern flank.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe French president could now nominate a politician from his own centrist minority ruling group or from the ranks of conservatives as the next premier, but that would mean doubling down on a strategy that has failed to yield a stable alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also could tack to the left and nominate a moderate socialist, or choose a technocrat.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE France to recognise Palestinian state in September, Emmanuel Macron says\n\nNo scenario would be likely to hand the next government a parliamentary majority. It was inevitable that the need to form a new government would result in a dilution of the deficit reduction plan, finance minister Eric Lombard said before the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nMacron may eventually decide the only path out of the crisis lies in calling a snap election, but he has so far resisted calls from Le Pen's National Rally and from France Unbowed to dissolve parliament a second time.\n\n\n\n",

But after a two-week camping trip by the Murray River, they were hooked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We stayed out there for two weeks and it was just beautiful,\" she told SBS News. \"I find the Murray to be one of the most spectacular places I've ever been, especially when you get out there on a kayak.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March this year, they packed up their lives in Melbourne and made the move permanent. Six months on, Jenelle can't imagine going back.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE I was priced out of my city into a regional town. It was the best thing that ever happened to me\n\n\"When I first left Melbourne, I thought I was going to miss a lot of things about the city. But now I don't feel the desire to rush back to the city at all,\" she said. \"It's much more of a relaxed lifestyle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe spends her mornings kayaking before running her pickleball business in Albury and enjoys the strong sense of community she's discovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of a sudden, I've got this amazing amount of social connection that I didn't have in Melbourne,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't realise I was missing that in the city.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut regional life comes with trade-offs. Local supermarkets close at 7pm, there\u2019s no Uber Eats, and she\u2019s now further away from her adult children in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have to be ready for the move,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s a difference between making the move because you really want to, and being pushed out. I knew what I was getting myself into.\"\n\n\n\nJenelle relocated from Melbourne to a quiet town outside Albury in March \u2014 and she hasn't looked back. Source: Supplied\n\nThe steady trickle to regional\n\nJenelle is part of a growing national trend, according to the latest Commonwealth Bank Regional Movers Index.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found 26 per cent more people are relocating from capital cities to regional areas than vice versa. Overall, regional migration remains strong despite falling to its lowest level since before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nAlbury saw the biggest growth in capital-regional migration \u2014 a 16-fold increase. Source: SBS News On the NSW-Victoria border, Albury recorded a 16-fold increase \u2014 or 1520 per cent \u2014 in net migration from capital cities in the 2024-25 financial year, the biggest surge of any regional hub in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther large growth areas were Gingin, WA (273.7 per cent); Townsville, Queensland (268.6 per cent); East Pilbara, WA (184.4 per cent); and Greater Bendigo, Victoria (136.6 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the largest regional hotspot was Queensland's Sunshine Coast, recording 7.4 per cent of the share of net capital-regional migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater Geelong, Victoria, slipped back to second place (7 per cent), while the Gold Coast, Queensland (5.9 per cent), Lake Macquarie, NSW (3.8 per cent) and Moorabool, Victoria (3.1 per cent), rounded out the top five most popular regional spots for capital city movers.\n\n\n\nThe largest regional hotspot was the Sunshine Coast, with Greater Geelong slipping back to second place. Source: SBS News \"Across Australia, this quarterly report shows an overall downturn in movement across the country of 15.2 per cent, which includes capital-to-capital relocation,\" Liz Ritchie, CEO of the Regional Australia Institute (RAI), said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, regional Australia is no longer a second choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index uses Commonwealth Bank data of 14.6 million customers to track internal migrations and help identify growth trends in regional centres.\n\n\n\nOverall, regional migration remains strong despite falling to its lowest level since before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even though mortgage rates are starting to come down, they\u2019re still high compared to what we\u2019ve seen in the past, which is making it harder for many people to buy in the cities,\" a Domain spokesperson told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s why regional areas are becoming more appealing, where around 14 per cent of houses and 31.3 per cent of units in regional Australia are actually cheaper to buy than rent, which is a huge drawcard for buyers.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia's new regional hotspot for city leavers as Sunshine Coast slips\n\nThey added that in the Albury region, prices have increased \u2014 but not as sharply as in other parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The median house price is now $612,000, up 9.3 per cent over the past year, showing strong demand, but it\u2019s still relatively affordable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median cost of a house in combined capital cities is $1,207,857, compared to a combined regional cost of $670,953, according to Domain's June 2025 House Price Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the ground in Albury, Ray White agent Andrew Papallo has seen the boom first-hand and says families relocating from Melbourne are leading the charge, followed by buyers from Canberra and Sydney.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How much you could save by renting and buying regionally - and how to pull off a move\n\n\"A lot of them can come here mortgage-free, which is a big thing for a lot of people,\" he told SBS News. \"There\u2019s less commuting, more time with family, and a slower pace. But 99 per cent of the time, it\u2019s for cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat demand has driven local prices up by 9.3 per cent in the last year, with the median house price now sitting at $612,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's massive for the area,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Albury is handling the growth pretty well. There's a lot more land being released.\"\n\n\n\nCan regional areas absorb the growth?\n\nBut rapid growth brings challenges. While Papallo says Albury-Wodonga has so far absorbed the influx, the pressure is showing in parts of the housing market.\n\n\n\n\n\nRental vacancy rates have sat below 1 per cent for years, Papallo says. Additionally, an increase in investor interest \u2014 which he says began booming last October \u2014 has left first-home buyers increasingly outcompeted by investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Geelong, it's a similar story, as it deals with a housing shortage, ageing infrastructure and congestion due to expansion.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Verabella didn\u2019t expect to be homeless for six months when she moved regionally\n\nResearch by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) found that increased migration to regional areas leads to a \"knock-on effect\" of higher prices in both rent and home purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nicole Gurran from the University of Sydney, who led the research, said that the flow-on effects of this can mean low-income households are forced to move \"significant distances\" to find housing they can afford.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report made several recommendations, including the investment in regional infrastructure to support people in non-metropolitan areas, support of low-income renters in regional areas, and better coordination between federal, state and local governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Liz Allen, a demographer at the Australian National University, warns that regional growth is challenging for policymakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That footprint is increasing at an alarming rate and in fact we're seeing the rates of increase and population growth occurring the fastest in regional areas ... which spells some really difficult times for policymakers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- With additional reporting by Gabrielle Katanasho and the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

And that startled me so I went to the GP, and he did some tests and then sent me off to a urologist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cancer had become metastatic, spreading to five different bones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I thought I was gone. You know, once it's on the bone, you hear all these stories and you think.. oh.. how long will I last? But I never ask that question because in the back of my mind I always thought 'I can beat this'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFighting it would prove punishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff's PSA levels - a marker for the cancer - continued to increase, even after his prostate was removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My first experience with the chemotherapy wasn't until early last year, and it was horrendous. I got every side effect you could possibly imagine, and I couldn't eat. I couldn't do... I lost 15 kilos, and you think you're going to die.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen chemotherapy became ineffective, he found relief in clinical drug trials, which are now helping him manage life with stage four cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate cancer is now the country's most prevalent cancer with nearly 72 men diagnosed every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the five year survival rate is more than 95 per cent, nearly 4,000 men died from the disease last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia says only 36 per cent of cases are detected at a stage when it can be most effectively treated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group's national chairman, Adjunct Associate Professor Steve Callister says PCFA will soon release new guidelines recommending that a simple blood test is the preferred way to diagnose rather than a rectal examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The importance of early diagnosis can't be understated. If you've got a family history, you should start to get tested after the age of 40, and if you're over 50, you should get tested regularly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some may not experience symptoms, signs to look out for include frequent or weak urination, incontinence, pain in the back, hips or pelvis or blood in the urine or semen.\n\n\n\nBut catching it early can be tricky, with barriers to treatment and diagnostic accessibility, and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live in an area outside a major city, your risk of dying from the disease increases by 24 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you're from a multicultural background, research suggests you have poorer outcome,s from late diagnosis to treatment inequalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate Cancer specialist nurses help families and patients navigate the complexities of treatment with sensitivity and dignity, often reducing the emotional burden on family members and patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nNurse Levina Saad from the Sydney Adventist Hospital says different organisations can still improve their resources for people from different cultural backgrounds... but there has been an improvement over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being able to troubleshoot or think about what the best resources are for them in terms of obviously their language, but also their background and their needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow for the first time, researchers will follow the treatment journey of hundreds of men from different language and cultural groups with prostate cancer to find out what hurdles they face, including language barriers and cultural sensitivities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Ben Tran from Melbourne's WEHI- a medical research group - says currently there are few resources for those men and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As treatment gets more and more complicated, our ability to explain things sufficiently to people from backgrounds different to ourselves becomes harder. And I think if we're aware of it, that's the first step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Tran hopes his team's research will improve patient outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's really important that we dig deeper into this issue and try and find out what groups are impacted the most.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia is already taking steps to improve its online resources; its website can now be translated into 40 languages.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Korean pop music, or K-pop, is now a certified cultural phenomenon that has captivated millions worldwide, including in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut beyond the soft power spectacle lies something closer to home: Australian K-pop stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom BLACKPINK\u2019s Ros\u00e9 to Stray Kids' Bang Chan and Felix, Aussie K-pop 'idols' (the name given to K-pop stars) are bringing their hometown stories, slang and accents to one of the world's biggest music industries \u2014 and by extension, to the world.\n\n\n\nK-pop in Australia\n\nThe K-pop fanbase in Australia is comprised mainly of teens and young adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nFans are drawn in by the perfectly synchronised choreography, dazzling visuals and catchy earworms sung in both Korean and English.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile far smaller than the fanbases in the United States or Asian countries, Australian K-pop fans are passionate and engaged.\n\n\n\nThis is evidenced by streaming numbers and sold-out arena tours.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of writing, the song Golden from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters (2025) was enjoying its fifth week at the top of the ARIA Top 50 Singles chart.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian K-pop fans are heavily online, and many are highly motivated to take part in event coordination, such as to celebrate idols' birthdays, as well as content creation, from dance covers to merchandise guides.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffline, K-pop's growing popularity has seen Australia host a number of world tours, with acts such as BLACKPINK, Twice, and Stray Kids performing sold-out concerts to fans in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Twice became the first Korean act to headline a stadium show in Australia, to an audience of 25,000 fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will return later this year for a 360-degree stage arena tour.\n\n\n\nWhy Australian idols?\n\nWhile musical talent in the Western music industry is typically discovered 'organically', K-pop works differently.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe industry is run by South Korean entertainment companies, including the 'big four': HYBE, SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese companies cast their nets globally to sign prospective idols, often under the age of 15.\n\n\n\nMany will train for years, living in shared dorms under strict conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a fraction of the people recruited end up debuting in a K-pop group.\n\n\n\n\n\nSinging and dance skills are, of course, a requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, other factors such as English fluency, international marketability and multicultural backgrounds are now also extremely valuable for hopeful idols.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis reflects a broader trend in the K-pop industry, wherein the use of English has grown, both through song lyrics and the outsourcing of Western idols and artists for collaborations and features.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was set in motion by the enormous success of BTS' 2020 hit Dynamite.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis song was the group\u2019s first entirely English track, and the first K-pop song to hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n\nSince then, English has played a major role in driving K-pop's global visibility, accessibility and chart success.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my research on the rising use of English in K-pop, I have found that while an Australian presence in the industry is still relatively rare, it is growing fast \u2013 likely due to a demand for English proficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2025, just 25 idols with Australian ties have debuted in the industry \u2014 a figure that pales in comparison to the more than 140 from both Japan and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, 15 of these 25 idols debuted in the last five years and, most importantly, many are members of some of the biggest K-pop acts, including BLACKPINK'S Ros\u00e9, Stray Kids' Bang Chan and Felix, NewJeans' Hanni and Danielle, NMIXX's Lily and ENHYPEN's Jake.\n\n\n\nStray Kids members Bang Chan (left) and Felix (third from left) both grew up in Sydney before joining the K-pop group. Source: Getty / Sergione Infuso / Corbis Ros\u00e9, most famously known for her single Apt. featuring Bruno Mars, grew up in Melbourne \u2014 while Bang Chan and Felix were raised in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese idols now serve as unofficial Australian ambassadors both onstage and online, with their Australian roots forming an integral part of their idol identity.\n\n\n\nThe 'Aussie line'\n\nThis visibility has led K-pop fans to celebrate this distinct cohort, nicknamed the 'Aussie line'.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany fans delight in their Australian accents, use of local slang and stories about growing up in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome idols even embrace the 'Aussie line' label themselves.\n\n\n\nIn an industry where North American idols are normalised, their distinct 'Aussie-ness' provides a novelty enjoyed not just by local fans, but internationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, their presence in K-pop highlights the limitations of Australia's own music industry, which remains a site of insecurity and instability for local musicians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is reflected in the ongoing underrepresentation of Australian acts in the ARIA charts .\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this, Asian-Australian musicians (and Asian-Australians in general) have long had to contend with various forms of racism, prejudice and social exclusion.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australia's two biggest supermarket chains may have to fork out more than $1 billion in repayments and other costs between them after a court ruled they underpaid thousands of salaried managers for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Court ruling would also require \"significant and widespread changes\" to accepted retail practice for both Woolworths Group and Australian businesses, large and small, the company said on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Justice Nye Perram ruled Woolworths and Coles did not comply with their obligation to keep accurate employment records and paid workers their salaries without tracking other entitlements owed under the retail award.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoolworths estimates that, based on the judgment, it will have to pay another $250 million to $470 million to salaried store leaders, with interest, superannuation and payroll taxes adding another $200 million to $280 million to its net liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a total pre-tax liability of as much as $750 million for Woolworths, or $530 million after taxes.\n\n\n\n\"This is a very preliminary estimate with significant uncertainty, and is based on a historical analysis of clocked time and attendance records,\" Woolworths said on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nColes estimates it will have to pay between $150 million and $250 million to address the court's findings, on top of the $31 million in remediation it has already paid.\n\n\n\n\n\nColes reiterated its apology on Monday.\n\n\n\nWhat was the underpayment case about?\n\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman brought the class action case against Woolworths on behalf of 32 managers at five locations across Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane from June 2015 to September 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case against Coles involved 42 managers, some of whom were employed in multiple shops, from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerram will conduct a case management hearing on 27 October to determine the next steps and compensation for the affected 27,700 employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoolworths said it was too early to consider an appeal of any aspects of the complex decision, which spans 82,000 words.\n\n\n\n",
