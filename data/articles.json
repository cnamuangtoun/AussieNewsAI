(AP)\n\n\"There is a practical and growing acceptance that 2050 is likely to push right, but that does not mean an abandonment of low and zero emissions technologies.\"\n\nThe former PM said his 2021 position on a net zero target was a \"practical direction\" and not a mandate.\n\nHe argued the landscape of climate change has changed drastically in the past four years, along with his opinion on how and when net zero could be reached.\n\nMorrison said he still backed a net zero aspiration but relented on his previous view that the Coalition should legislate its way to a 2050 target.\n\n\"Post COVID, energy demand is rising with AI needs and private capital is being deployed at scale to solve the affordability, reliability and emissions challenge in a way we have not seen before,\" Morrison added.\n\n\"In 2021 we were also facing a potential capital strike on Australia from OS investors as they responded to US policy under President Biden.\n\n\"This has also changed.\"\n\nMorrison pointed to Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates' recent change of approach to climate change.\n\nIn a recent post on his personal website , Gates said that the \"doomsday view\" \u2013 that it will \"decimate civilisation\" \u2013 is wrong.\n\n\"Emissions projections have gone down, and with the right policies and investments, innovation will allow us to drive emissions down much further,\" Gates wrote.\n\nREAD MORE: Major banks drop grim new forecast for interest rates\n\nJoyce had previously described the climate policy as a \"lunatic crusade\".

This remains the sensible approach.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Sussan Ley vowed to review the party's climate policy following the federal election. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nThere has been division among Coalition ranks over the feasibility of net zero by 2050.\n\nJoyce and Nationals MP Michael McCormack have jointly backed a private member bill to repeal net zero.\n\nIn July, Joyce \u2013 who has since snubbed the Nationals over its net zero position \u2013 described the climate policy as a \"lunatic crusade\".\n\nShadow \ufeffeducation minister Jonno Duniam warned many would leave the frontbench if Ley supports the target,\n\nLey said she would review the party's climate policy after its historic defeat at the May federal election.",

        "text": "A typical new retiree could lose out on as much as $136,000 over the course of their retirement due to the bewildering complexity of Australia's superannuation system, according to a new report.\n\nThe staggering figure\u2014equivalent to $6,500 a year\u2014was highlighted in modelling released today by the Super Members Council, which found the system's \"daunting complexity\" is stopping everyday Australians from achieving their full financial potential in their post-work years.\n\nAustralia is on the cusp of a \"silver tsunami,\" with 2.8 million Australians racing towards retirement in the coming decade. This influx will effectively double the number of Australians retiring each year, jumping from 150,000 to 300,000.\n\nReform is needed to fix Australia's overly complex superannuation system, a new report has found. (iStock)\n\nThe amount of money in super held by these retirees will almost double, too, soaring from around $750 billion over the past decade to almost $1.5 trillion over the next.\n\nIn its report, the Super Members points to the current complexity and rigidity of the system as a significant barrier to a simple, seamless transition into retirement for many.\n\nOne critical finding reveals that about 700,000 Australians over 65 who aren't working full-time still have their super sitting in taxed savings-phase super accounts, which drastically lowers their disposable income in retirement.\n\nThe report calls for a series of urgent, short-term reforms to prepare the super system, including the need to:\n\nExpand access to simple, affordable financial advice and digital tools.\n\nEnable safe and effective data sharing with Government to allow funds to optimise incomes and offer retirement income dashboards.\n\nSupport Smart Retirement Pathways and suggest the best retirement income solution for members.\n\nFix issues that lead to dual super accounts for retirees.\n\nFor the longer term, the council proposes bolder directions, such as simplifying a transition to tax-free income\u2014including considering automatically removing tax from accounts at age 65 for eligible members\u2014and rethinking minimum drawdown requirements for poorer retirees. It also recommends strengthening consumer protection by applying a quality filter on all retirement products.\n\nDispelling a \"persistent myth\" that most retirees underspend their super, the report actually shows that drawdowns are typically higher than the minimums required. In 2024\u201325, approximately 64 per cent of tax-free retirement account holders (two in every three retirees) withdrew above the minimum. This proportion was even higher for those with less than $50,000 in super, at 77 per cent.\n\n\"We need to make the shift into retirement so much simpler, easier and more intuitive for everyday Australians,\" Super Members Council CEO Misha Schubert said.\n\n\"This challenge is now incredibly urgent as almost 3 million Australians start to race towards retirement in the coming years.\"\n\n\"Moving to a system of simpler, smarter pathways into retirement would mean every Australian could retire with confidence, knowing they're not missing out on money to pay the bills and enjoy life to the fullest.\"\n\nThe report's findings echo a report by the Grattan Institute, released in January, which found the complexity in Australia's superannuation system was leaving retirees stressed and lacking the confidence to spend their super savings.",

        "text": "Nvidia has become the first $US5 trillion ($7.6 trillion) company, just three months after the Silicon Valley chipmaker was the first to break through the $US4 trillion barrier.\n\nIt has hit the incredible benchmark off the back of an artificial intelligence craze that\u2019s widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.\n\nApple rode the iPhone\u2019s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $US1 trillion, $US2 trillion and eventually $US3 trillion.\n\nJensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp, during the keynote address at the Nvidia AI summit in Washington, DC, earlier this week. (Bloomberg)\n\nBut there are concerns of a possible AI bubble , with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month flagging the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The head of the International Monetary Fund has raised a similar alarm.\n\nThe ravenous appetite for Nvidia\u2019s chips is the main reason that the company\u2019s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023. On Wednesday (Thursday AEDT), the shares closed at $US207.04 with 24.3 billion shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $US5.03 trillion.\n\nNvidia's value is now greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nNvidia carved out an early lead in tailoring its chipsets known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, from use in powering video games to helping to train powerful AI systems, such as the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators.\n\nDemand skyrocketed as more people began using AI chatbots. Tech companies scrambled for more chips to build and run them.\n\nNvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns of a bubble bursting. He said the generative AI chatbots that were merely \u201cinteresting\u201d when they first took hold a few years ago were now becoming so useful they would become profitable.\n\nNvidia has entered uncharted territory in terms of its value. (Bloomberg)\n\nHuang was headed to South Korea this week as leaders from major Pacific Rim economies, including the United States, China and Japan, gathered for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit that has long championed free trade but is now confronting sweeping US tariffs on technology and other products.\n\nThe multilateral gathering in Gyeongju is expected to be overshadowed by a sideline event \u2014 a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u2014 as their intensifying trade war leaves the South Korean hosts in a difficult balancing act.\n\nThis week, Huang disclosed $US500 billion in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $US1 billion investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia is teaming with the US Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers.\n\nLast month, Nvidia announced it would invest $US100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centres to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nIn August, Huang said Nvidia was discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. Trump said on Air Force One that he would speak to Xi about Nvidia's chips on the sidelines of the APEC event that Huang is also attending.\n\nIn August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15 per cent cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips would end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.\n\nThat same month, Trump announced the US government had taken a 10 per cent stake in Intel worth around $US11 billion.\n\nThen, Nvidia announced last month it was investing $US5 billion in Intel and would collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company.",

        "text": "Australians struggling under the weight of high mortgage repayments now won't receive any more relief from the RBA, according to one of the nation's biggest banks.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has handed down three rate cuts this year, and most economists had been predicting another one or two were still to come by midway through 2026.\n\nIndeed, just a fortnight ago, the market had been pricing in a more than 80 per cent chance of a cut next week.\n\nCBA and Westpac have both changed their interest rate forecasts after Wednesday's inflation data. (Supplied)\n\nBut yesterday's scorching inflation data, with the CPI rising by 1.3 per cent in the September quarter , while the trimmed mean \u2013 the RBA's preferred measure of underlying inflation \u2013 rose by an even 1.0 per cent.\n\nMichele Bullock said on Monday that even a 0.9 per cent result on the latter measure \ufeffwould be a \"material miss\", and economists have been quick to push back their forecasts in the wake of yesterday's data.\n\nWestpac, which had previously been an outlier as the only member of the big four to be banking on a rate cut next week, scrapped that prediction yesterday, saying even February may be too soon for the RBA to reduce the cash rate again.\n\n\"Even a February cut is far from certain now, given the size of the upside surprise this quarter,\" chief economist Luci Ellis said.\n\n\"We are conducting a full reassessment for the cash rate outlook in light of both the inflation outcome and the evolving picture on domestic demand.\"\n\nThe more alarming new forecast, though, came from Commonwealth Bank, which now believes the RBA is finished cutting and will leave the cash rate at 3.60 per cent for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Given the material upside surprise to the Q3 25 CPI, and the broad\u2011based nature of pricing pressures, we now expect the RBA to remain on hold from here,\" senior economist Belinda Allen said.\n\nSurging electricity prices was one of the main drivers of the unexpectedly high inflation result. (AP)\n\n\"Previously, we expected one last rate cut in February 2026 to bring the cash rate back closer to neutral.\n\n\"Higher inflation and the cyclical upswing in demand now underway, driven largely by consumption and housing, will see the RBA conclude that the economy needs the cash rate to remain in slightly restrictive territory.\"\n\nThe nation's biggest lender even cautioned that the Reserve Bank may be forced to raise interest rates next year.\n\n\"The latest data has tilted the risks to the upside, and the RBA will be closely watching the monthly inflation data,\" Allen said.\n\n\"If inflation remains elevated in 2026 as we expect it could, the RBA may need to act.\"\n\nEllis, though, had a silver lining for borrowers sweating on another rate cut, saying there could be more relief than expected next year because the chance of a pre-Christmas rate cut has been ended.\n\n\"Delay now adds to the chances of more cuts next year,\" the Westpac chief economist wrote.\n\n\"Over 2026, though, we expect the RBA to be surprised by the gradual softening in the labour market, and the resulting benign wages growth\u2026 easing in conditions should fade in 2027 assuming private sector demand growth does pick up as we are currently forecasting,\" she added.\n\n\"By that point, though, inflation could be below the target midpoint, which would point to scope for less restrictive monetary policy.\"\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

        "text": "Bill Gates has called for governments, investors, activists and scientists to change their approach to the climate crisis ahead of next month's COP30 summit in Brazil.\n\nIn a post on his personal website, the Microsoft founder said that the \"doomsday view\" of climate change \u2013 that it will \"decimate civilisation\" \u2013 is wrong.\n\n\"Although climate change will have serious consequences \u2013 particularly for people in the poorest countries \u2013 it will not lead to humanity's demise,\" he wrote.\n\nREAD MORE: Minister to investigate after year 12s taught wrong subject for final exam \ufeff\n\nBill Gates has called for a change of approach to combating climate change. (AP)\n\n\"People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Emissions projections have gone down, and with the right policies and investments, innovation will allow us to drive emissions down much further.\"\n\nGates said that, because of that view, there was an overwhelming focus on short-term emissions reduction targets, which is diverting resources away from measures he claimed are more cost-effective at improving people's lives.\n\nPointing to a need for greater innovation \u2013 particularly to remove the \"green premium\", or the extra cost associated with using zero-emissions products \u2013 and to better measure the impact of climate initiatives, he wrote that next month's UN climate conference was a perfect opportunity to change approach.\n\nREAD MORE: Rate cut hopes dealt massive blow as inflation surges again \ufeff\n\nThe multibillionaire said more focus needed to be placed on improving lives than cutting emissions. (via CNN Newsource)\n\n\"This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,\" he said.\n\n\"Our chief goal should be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions who live in the world's poorest countries.\n\n\"Although climate change will hurt poor people more than anyone else, for the vast majority of them it will not be the only or even the biggest threat to their lives and welfare.\n\n\"The biggest problems are poverty and disease, just as they always have been.\n\n\"Understanding this will let us focus our limited resources on interventions that will have the greatest impact for the most vulnerable people.\"\n\nGates still said climate change was a crucial issue that needs to be urgently addressed. (Leigh Henningham)\n\nGates, who was previously the world's richest man and currently has a net worth of about $US122 billion ($185 billion), has invested more than $100 billion into charitable causes, and has previously pledged to give away the majority of his fortune before he dies.\n\nMuch of his philanthropic work has focused on initiatives such as malaria prevention and climate adaptation, and he stressed in his post that rising global temperatures was still a crucial issue that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n\"It needs to be solved, along with other problems like malaria and malnutrition,\" Gates wrote.\n\n\"Every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people's lives\u2026\n\n\"Climate change, disease, and poverty are all major problems. We should deal with them in proportion to the suffering they cause.",

        "text": "US President Donald Trump says he has given South Korea approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, a dramatic move that would admit Seoul to a small club of nations possessing such vessels.\n\nMr Trump, who has been meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and other regional leaders during his visit, also said Seoul had agreed to buy vast quantities of US oil and gas.\n\nThe submarine will be built in a Philadelphia shipyard, where South Korean firms have increased investment, Mr Trump wrote on social media.\n\nMr Trump and Mr Lee finalised details of a fraught trade deal at a summit in South Korea on Wednesday.\n\nMr Lee had also been seeking US permission for South Korea to reprocess nuclear fuel.\n\nNuclear restrictions easing?\n\nSeoul is barred from reprocessing without US consent, under a pact between the countries.\n\n\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nSouth Korea's Industry Ministry said its officials had not been involved in any detailed discussions about building the submarines in Philadelphia.\n\nWhile South Korea has a sophisticated shipbuilding industry, Mr Trump did not spell out where the propulsion technology would come from for a nuclear-powered submarine, which only a handful of countries possess.\n\nThe US has been working with Australia and Britain on a project for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, involving technology transfers from the United States.\n\nThe US has so far only shared that technology with Britain, back in the 1950s.\n\nMr Lee said when he met Mr Trump on Wednesday that allowing South Korea to build several nuclear-powered submarines equipped with conventional weapons would significantly reduce the burden on the US military.\n\nHe also asked for Mr Trump's support to make substantial progress on South Korea being allowed to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, or on uranium enrichment.\n\nThis is not allowed under the nuclear agreement between the two countries, even though South Korea possesses nuclear reactors to generate power.\n\nApproval raises questions\n\nAustralia is all in on AUKUS. In Trump's America, it's more complicated In Washington on Monday, Anthony Albanese made something clear once again: Australia is all-in on the trilateral defence pact. Clarifying what US powerbrokers think remains a multi-billion-dollar question.\n\nMr Lee's predecessors had wanted to build nuclear-powered submarines, but the US had opposed this idea for decades.\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said the issue of South Korea acquiring such submarines \"raises all sorts of questions.\"\n\n\"As with the AUKUS deal, (South Korea) is probably looking for nuclear propulsion services suitable for subs, including the fuel, from the US,\" he said.\n\nMr Kimball said such submarines usually involved the use of highly-enriched uranium and would \"require a very complex new regime of safeguards\" by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has a key role in implementing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\n\"It remains technically and militarily unnecessary for South Korea to acquire the technology to extract weapons-usable plutonium from spent fuel or to acquire uranium enrichment capabilities, which can also be used to produce nuclear weapons,\" he said.\n\n\" If the United States seeks to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide, the Trump administration should resist such overtures from allies as strongly as it works to deny adversary access to these dual-use technologies. \"\n\nJenny Town, who heads 38 North, a Korea-focused research group in Washington, said it was inevitable that South Korean demands for US cooperation on nuclear issues would grow, given recent allegations about Russian technical cooperation to help nuclear-armed North Korea make progress towards acquiring nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nKim Dong-yup, a North Korea studies professor at Kyungnam University, said the Lee-Trump summit had formalised a \"transaction scheme of security guarantees and economic contributions\" for maintaining the extended deterrence and alliance in exchange for South Korea's increased defence spending and nuclear-powered subs and US investments.\n\n\"In the end, this South Korea-US summit can be summarised in one word: the commercialisation of the alliance and the commodification of peace,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is that the balance of that deal was to maximise American interests rather than the autonomy of the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nReuters",

        "text": "Landholders have condemned the NSW government for considering compulsory land acquisition for the Santos Narrabri Gas Project.\n\nIn a speech to the Australian Workers' Union yesterday, Premier Chris Minns said the government would consider acquisition to ensure it could proceed with getting energy into the manufacturing base of the Hunter region.\n\nSpeaking to media today, Mr Minns continued to defend those remarks, highlighting that after more than a decade, a definitive decision on the Santos project still hung in the air.\n\n\"All of the predictions that were made when the project was originally stopped \u2014 that it would put pressure on the industrial base of the state and lead to higher prices \u2014 have all come to fruition and ultimately a decision needs to be made,\" he said.\n\n\" The NSW government is serious when we say we need to press on with this, it's too important when it comes to jobs and opportunities, particularly manufacturing in the Hunter. \"\n\nContamination concerns\n\nThe Narrabri gas field expansion is a multi-billion-dollar project proposed for north-west New South Wales, on land governed by a native title agreement with the Gomeroi people.\n\nIf approved, the project would see a new coal seam gas field developed over 95,000 hectares, with plans for 850 wells to be drilled and 1,000 hectares of land to be cleared.\n\nSantos has gas facilities in Pilliga state forest. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nNSW Farmers Association President Xavier Martin accused the premier of putting Santos ahead of families and farmers.\n\n\"We do strongly condemn Premier Minns's ill-advised threat of compulsory land acquisition to support a multi-billion-dollar mining corporation,\" he said\n\n\"There's an enormous amount of scientific evidence and lived experience that this sort of project risks contamination of groundwater.\n\n\"This water is relied [on] by not just farmers \u2026 but all our towns and villages.\"\n\nXavier Martin has condemned the NSW government for considering compulsory land acquisition. (ABC News: Lani Oataway)\n\nMr Martin referred to the Queensland Office of Groundwater Impact Assessment, released last week, which looked at how coal seam gas industry impacted groundwater pressure in the Great Artesian Basin.\n\n\"[It] came out with all the issues around contamination, subsidence and complete dewatering of many of the bores in the Artesian Basin in Queensland,\" he said.\n\n\" Surprise, surprise, we're on the same Artesian Basin. It covers nearly half the nation. \"\n\nPremier Minns said there had been a \"comprehensive scientific audit in relation to the fields\".\n\nEarlier this year, the National Native Title Tribunal ruled the NSW government could lease land to Santos for the Narrabri Gas Project.\n\nAt the time, Gomeroi woman and native title applicant Polly Cutmore said the decision was upsetting, but her people would continue to fight to protect their country.\n\nFacing a fight\n\nPresident of the Hunter Gas Landholder Rights Alliance Mick Fetch said Santos was trying to bully landholders.\n\n\"Santos is obviously leaning on the premier to in turn bully landholders, it's just a clear message that they're losing the fight,\" Mr Fetch said.\n\n\"They've only got 30 per cent of landholders signed up along this 800km route and that's been an approved survey route since 2009, so they're obviously desperate.\n\n\"They take out full-page ads saying that you can continue normal farming practices, but they hand us a contract that holds us over for the next seven years that says we have to get permission from them to use our land in a certain way.\n\n\"They're going to face a fight because we're just not interested.\"\n\nA significant project\n\nChief executive of Energy Quest, and former Santos executive, Rick Wilkinson said the Narrabri Gas Project should not be \"underestimated\".\n\n\"It's supposed to be supplying half of NSW gas in a few short years and if it doesn't get up, then it's almost certain in my opinion that LNG imports will be required,\" he said.\n\nHe said there needed to be goodwill with the community for any gas project to advance.\n\nRick Wilkinson says common ground needs to be found for a project to work. (ABC News: Dean Caton)\n\n\"Both parties have to listen and listen carefully to the other side, and this usually involves some concessions along the way,\" he said.\n\n\"You can start with very different points of view but generally there's a common ground and an accommodation can be met, that only works if you can get goodwill between the relevant farmers and the gas companies.\"\n\nSantos has been contacted for comment.",

(Getty Images: Alex Davidson)\n\nOr will Australia's steely serial winners \u2014 who look set to welcome back captain and dual centurion from the pool phase Alyssa Healy \u2014 continue their march towards yet another title?\n\nAnd could rain \u2014 the pantomime villain of the tournament so far \u2014 play spoilsport once again on Thursday?\n\nThis is how to watch, how to listen and what to expect from the pointy end of Australia's 2025 Women's ODI World Cup campaign.\n\nThe roads to the semifinals\n\nThursday's semifinal is between the pool phase's top ranked side, Australia, and its fourth ranked side, India. The winner will play South Africa in Sunday's tournament decider.\n\nWhile Australia breezed into the knockouts, India had to fight for its place in the top four.\n\nAustralia went unbeaten in the pool phase of the tournament. (Getty Images: Surjeet Yadav)\n\nAfter going down to England, South Africa and Australia and having its match with Bangladesh washed out, the tournament co-hosts only secured passage to Thursday's semifinal with a rain-affected win over New Zealand in the second last round.\n\nBoasting tournament top-scorers Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal, and led by captain Harmanpreet Kaur, India has plenty of runs in them and has never been in a better position to claim a first ever Women's ODI World Cup.\n\nBut first, they must past a truly generational Australian side.\n\nAustralia's all-round team stands up in the pool phase\n\nAustralia's all-round abilities are unmatched in international cricket. (Getty Images: Matt Roberts/ICC)\n\nWomen's cricket features a higher proportion of all-rounders than men's cricket, but this Australian team takes it to another level.\n\nMegan Schutt and Darcie Brown are the only 'pure' bowlers to have played in the tournament for Australia, and wicketkeepers Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney aside, Phoebe Litchfield and Georgia Voll the only specialist batters.\n\nThis means that Australia both bats very deep and has more bowling 'plan bs' than any team in world cricket.\n\nLeg spinner and player of the tournament so far King \u2014 who averages over 18 with the bat in ODIs \u2014 has batted at No. 10 in most matches and smashed a vital half-century against Pakistan.\n\nKing picked up 7-18 against South Africa in the final pool match. (Getty Images: Matt Roberts)\n\nSeam bowling all-rounder Kim Garth \u2014 who played international cricket for Ireland before making her Australian debut in 2022 \u2014 batted as low as No. 9 during the pool phase.\n\nShe was a regular No. 3 before switching international allegiances.\n\nThe obvious benefit of having such an over-qualified tail means neither a competitive score nor successful chase are ever off the cards.\n\nThe Aussies went from 5-128 to 8-308 against New Zealand, relied on Garth to help chase down 331 against India and leant on King's timely 50 as well as Mooney's load bearing century against Pakistan.\n\nHaving up to 10 capable batters in a side also clearly increases the chance of at least one player going big.\n\nAsh Gardner, Mooney and Healy have all scored key centuries, while almost everyone else have taken turns making important contributions.\n\nIn terms of bowlers, Australia is truly spoilt for choice, with eight legitimate bowling options playing in most games of the tournament so far.\n\nHowever, the excellent form of Australia's frontline bowlers has meant captains Healy and Tahlia McGrath haven't had to get too creative with their decision making.\n\nSeam bowling all-rounder Sutherland has bowled the most overs of any Australian at the tournament, two of pacers Megan Schutt, Darcie Brown and Kim Garth have generally opened an innings, while spinners King, Gardner and Sophie Molineux have been predictably excellent in sub-continental conditions.\n\nKing's bowling has been potentially the story of the tournament so far for Australia. She's taken 13 wickets including figures of 7-18 in the seven wicket trouncing of South Africa \u2014 the best figures ever in ODI cricket by an Australian woman and the best in tournament history.\n\nMeanwhile, Sutherland has quietly made her way to the top of the tournament's wicket taking charts with 15.\n\nThis excellence and consistency has meant that seam bowling all-rounder McGrath has bowled less than five overs throughout the tournament while Perry \u2014 although she has seldom bowled at international level in recent years \u2014 hasn't had to deliver a ball.\n\nSo, India's task is simple, if mammoth, on both fronts: somehow find a way through Australia's seemingly never-ending batting stocks and destabilise Australia's attack enough that Healy must throw the ball to a player outside of her best five or six options.\n\nA sodden World Cup and the forecast for the knockouts\n\nFour of the 11 pool games scheduled for Colombo were washed out. (Getty Images: Sameera Peiris)\n\nAustralia was denied a chance at a perfect pool phase by a washout against Sri Lanka in Colombo on match day two.\n\nRain was a consistent theme across the pool phase, with five of its 29 matches finishing without a result due to bad weather.\n\nColombo was a particularly sodden sight \u2014 four of the 11 matches played in the Sri Lankan capital didn't produce a result.\n\nThe International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision to schedule so many games in a notoriously wet city in the middle of its rainy season has received flack from across the cricketing world.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nNew Zealand, particularly, was hard done by.\n\nTwo consecutive Colombo washouts against Sri Lanka and Pakistan \u2014 both games the Kiwis would have expected to win \u2014 all but ensured they wouldn't qualify for the knockouts.\n\nKiwi legend Sophie Devine \u2014 who farewelled international cricket in New Zealand's final group game against England \u2014 was particularly bemused after the washout against Pakistan. That game was called off when the Kiwis had Pakistan 5-92 and in all sorts.\n\n\"You wait four years for a World Cup and to have rain play such a massive part in it is disappointing\u2026 you've waited for so long and you want to test yourself against the best and to be scuppered by rain, it's a real shame for me,\" Devine said after the match against Pakistan.\n\nKiwi legend Devine farewelled international cricket in New Zealand's final pool phase game against England. (Getty Images: ICC/Matthew Lewis)\n\nPakistan and Sri Lanka had it even worse than New Zealand \u2014 three of their seven group games met an unfortunate rainy demise.\n\nBut Colombo has seen its last cricket for the tournament. Australia's semifinal clash with India and Sunday's decider are both scheduled for Mumbai.\n\nOn Thursday, morning clouds and possible showers are predicted to clear in time for the beginning of the semifinal, but weather could play a role in the grand final on Sunday, with scattered showers forecast throughout the afternoon.\n\nHow to watch, listen and follow\n\nABC Sport will blog and broadcast live radio coverage of every ball of Thursday evening's ICC Women's Cricket World Cup semifinal between Australia and India.

        "text": "A Mudgee winery has become the largest in Australia to operate its business entirely off the grid.\n\nLowe Wines operates its vineyard, winery, cellar door and restaurant on a solar and battery system.\n\nDirector and chief winemaker David Lowe said high electricity costs and supply issues drove the move, which had been transformative for the business.\n\nDavid Lowe says he loves his solar and battery system. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"Before, I was actually managing the power usage. You couldn't turn an oven on or a fridge on without something else being turned off,\" he said.\n\n\"It was really a day-by-day, seven-day-a-week monitoring of our power usage, but the trouble was that I didn't know how much power we were using, I only knew when it was a problem.\"\n\nMr Lowe said the business was now cash positive when it came to its monthly power bill.\n\nDavid Lowe celebrates the switching on of his off-grid system. (Supplied: Charlie Hodgkin)\n\nHe said the off-grid system could withstand even the most strenuous events on site.\n\nThis included watering systems for crops, lights, considerable refrigeration, heating, crushing and processing equipment, large motors and dishwashers.\n\n\"We had a wedding for 160 people on Friday night. We had 130 on Saturday night. We also \u2026 had about 300 paying customers to visit us. The restaurant was full, our bases were loaded, and I tell you what, I loved it. I love this machine,\" Mr Lowe said.\n\nThe solar and battery system copes with the business' high power use. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"We're not a small business \u2014 we employ 65 staff here, so we make this place work. It's a very, very important part of agritourism.\n\n\"The future's very bright, but without power, the whole place would have shut down.\"\n\nMr Lowe said the off-grid system was the final piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe system consists of 414 solar panels. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"We have our own factory, we have our own food processing plant, we have our own winery, we have our own restaurant. Now we have our own energy source,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel like I'm in control. I feel like we're managing our own business. Before, we were captive.\"\n\nEarly challenges\n\nIt has not been an easy process, however.\n\nAfter first installing some solar panels a few years ago, Mr Lowe found his energy costs were still $9,000 a month.\n\nHe eventually discovered that about 40 per cent of his panels had been installed incorrectly, and it was at that point that he decided to increase the number of panels to run off-grid.\n\nGreg Todd, director of SBS Solar and Water in Mudgee, the company that installed Lowe Wines's off-grid system, said it was clear Mr Lowe was exasperated.\n\nGreg and Kate Todd helped David Lowe come up with a solution. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"For years, David had problems with insufficient power to the property, and he'd been told the answer to that was bigger poles and wires,\" Mr Todd said.\n\n\"More money spent and then still paying a power bill, so we came up with a solution to create a full off-grid system.\"\n\nThe system consists of 414 solar panels at 265kW, as well as 1.2MWh battery storage.\n\nThe battery storage unit on the Mudgee property. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nA common trend\n\nVictoria University Victoria Energy Policy Centre director Bruce Mountain said more people were switching off the grid due to frustration with supply and rising electricity prices.\n\n\"The price of battery and solar has come down, and as a consequence, it's now economically attractive,\" he said.\n\n\"It started out just solar, and then it's become solar plus storage, and integrating solar plus storage and sometimes diesel backup is leading to individual customers going off-grid and often little micro-grids.\"\n\nBruce Mountain says solar and battery systems have become more attractive. (ABC News: Peter Garnish)\n\nProfessor Mountain said off-grid systems were immune to power outages caused by downed powerlines.\n\nBut he said up-front costs could turn some agricultural businesses off the option.\n\n\"They need to be able to ensure they have enough supply for sequences of dark days, possibly weeks in winter, and so they need to ensure they have adequate solar supply for that and then the power capacity in the backup battery,\" he said.\n\nMr Lowe said his biggest concern was his curious donkeys potentially damaging his solar panels.\n\nDavid Lowe says his donkeys can be a little too inquisitive. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nBut a simple paddock move could be the solution.\n\n\"I absolutely recommend this to anyone who's in agriculture \u2026 who's got lots of land, just to have the panels pointing in the right direction.

(Supplied: Bionic Storage)\n\nMerryn Austin from Bionic Storage at Landsborough said there was an easy fix to the issue, but council zoning laws would not allow it.\n\n\"A few years ago, we were trying to get a zoning change on a block out at Caloundra to store caravans, which was a bit of a grey area in the planning scheme,\" she said.\n\n\"The state government did approve for us to have caravans there, but council really didn't want it because it would cause a change in zoning.\"\n\nSunshine Coast Council receives more than 700 complaints annually about caravan street parking. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jake Kearnan)\n\nThe block of land was located near the Caloundra racecourse and was zoned as a rural property, not industrial.\n\n\"If they relaxed the laws a little bit and allowed people with acreage or rural properties to accommodate vans, instead of only allowing it for industrial zoning, that would help the problem,\" Ms Austin said.\n\n\"If people have got 70 acres, I don't understand why they can't store caravans there.\n\n\"A lot of people could make use of their land, but then it comes down to them running a commercial business on rural land, which becomes a whole new issue.\"\n\nBetter planning needed\n\nSunshine Coast Mayor Rosanna Natoli presented the motion at last week's LGAQ conference, and it was supported by an overwhelming majority.\n\n\"This is an issue impacting our council and others across the state, with residents complaining about safety concerns, a lack of available parking and neighbourhood streets that are clogged and ugly,\" she said.\n\n\"We receive 700 complaints a year plus thousands of signatures on petitions, and we are not alone.\n\nRosanna Natoli says caravan street parking is an issue in many areas.

(Supplied: Youtube)\n\nA spokesperson for the NSW Minister for Racing David Harris said the state government supported a competitive, responsible and sustainable greyhound racing industry, \"with the highest standard of animal welfare\".\n\n\"It is important that, in considering any decisions around its track portfolio, GRNSW engages appropriately with industry stakeholders, given the impact of any closures on greyhound racing participants,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the number of greyhound racing tracks set to close, and that the Wentworth Park track would close. The story has been updated to accurately reflect the number of tracks closing, and note that a decision has not yet been made regarding Wentworth Park.",

Despite wins over Japan and Saudi Arabia in World Cup qualification, and in the two-match Soccer Ashes series against New Zealand, Popovic came away a little disappointed, feeling that they were missing what he described as a quintessentially Australian characteristic. Christian Pulisic was injured against the Socceroos. Credit: AP \u201cWe actually lacked what we\u2019ve always had as a nation in football, and even in all codes: that we are tough, we are resilient, we are hard to beat, we are hard to play against,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to develop football, to play better football. But we can\u2019t forget what makes us, what\u2019s our DNA. And I think we\u2019ve gone away from that. I thought the first game against New Zealand, to an extent, we almost got bullied in the game. And I can\u2019t fathom that, how that can happen with Australians.\u201d\n\nPopovic doesn\u2019t want them to play recklessly, but believes a more hard-nosed approach can actually enhance those other, newer qualities. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win, and we shouldn\u2019t forget that side of us,\u201d he said. Jordan Bos takes on two Americans. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYou can see through the whole country, from grassroots all the way through, we\u2019re trying to develop a better style of play \u2013 but we can\u2019t forget that. Because if you look at all the best teams in the world, when they lose a game, the coach will come out and say: \u2018We didn\u2019t win our duels, we didn\u2019t win our second balls, so we couldn\u2019t maintain momentum, or we couldn\u2019t maintain the pressure. We\u2019re too soft.\u2019 \u201cReally, it should be expected that we do that. So from now on, I expect to see that.\u201d\n\nMore than a year on from assuming the role, Popovic has settled into it beautifully. As he held court in an hour-long press conference this week, there was no evasiveness and no defensiveness. He answered every question directly and expansively, covering off a range of topics: himself, the mistakes he\u2019s made, Australia\u2019s broader talent pool and their connection with mainstream audiences, his ambitions for the team and belief in it, what he wants to see from younger players, the structural factors in the domestic game that are holding them back, and his definition of leadership. \u2018If they want to play at a World Cup ... their level needs to be the highest they\u2019ve ever had. Any shorter than that will leave you out.\u2019 Tony Popovic OK, maybe there was a bit of evasiveness when he was asked about his future, since his contract expires at the end of the World Cup \u2013 but even as he predictably described it as a bridge he\u2019d cross when he comes to it, he also said he felt it was his \u201cduty\u201d to plan as if he would be there beyond that, to prepare for the 2027 Asian Cup and the next World Cup cycle. And you could tell how seriously he takes that duty. In his embrace of the pressure of the role, the gravitas with which he carries himself, and the magnitude of his vision, Popovic is Postecoglou-esque.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a burden for me,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cI don\u2019t carry extra weight because I\u2019m the Socceroos coach. I carry joy, and it\u2019s a pleasure, and there\u2019s nothing difficult about it for me. There are challenges, but there are challenges in every job. \u201cI love this job. I\u2019m honoured. I love the responsibility.\u201d On the matter of his World Cup squad and the jostling for positions in it, Popovic is keeping an open mind, staying alive to the possibility that someone could come from the clouds and unseat an established star. Whoever makes the cut will know exactly what is expected of them: everything.\n\n\u201cThe key is that if they want to play at a World Cup, they have to understand that their level needs to be the highest they\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cAny shorter than that will leave you out of the World Cup.\u201d Loading His dream, he said, was for the Socceroos to be consistently mixing it with the world\u2019s best. To no longer be considered underdogs. And he doesn\u2019t want to wait until he\u2019s an old man sitting on his couch to see it. \u201cI keep saying it to the group: one day, Australia will go very far in the World Cup. Why not this group?\u201d Popovic said.",

        "text": "Without data on inflation and unemployment \u2013 the two key metrics the Fed needs to manage with its dual mandate of maximising employment while maintaining stable prices \u2013 its policymakers are flying blind, which Powell conceded might influence the outcome of the December meeting. Loading \u201cWhat do you do if you\u2019re driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to that. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s certainly a possibility that you would say \u2018we really can\u2019t see. So let\u2019s slow down\u2019.\u201d Even leaving aside the impact of the dearth of data for an institution that prides itself on being data-driven, there would be no certainty of a December cut.\n\nThe decision to trim the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, the second rate cut this year, wasn\u2019t unanimous. Trump\u2019s man inside the Fed, Stephen Miran, who may be warming the seat for Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed Powell when he is scheduled to retire next May, voted for a 50-basis-point cut for the second time in the two meetings he has attended. Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid voted for no change, and Powell indicated there were others who would like the Fed to move cautiously. \u201cFor some part of the committee, it\u2019s time to maybe take a step back and see whether there really are downside risks to the labour market, or see whether in fact, the stronger growth that we\u2019re seeing is real,\u201d he said. \u2018A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\u2019 Fed chair Jerome Powell Complicating the Fed\u2019s task is that, while America\u2019s unemployment rate was rising (despite Trump\u2019s draconian immigration policies that are shrinking the pool of available labour) before the shutdown\u2019s data blackout, so is inflation, as the impact of his tariffs slowly bleeds through into prices that, since mid-year, have been steadily edging up with each release of the inflation data.\n\nA slew of big job cuts in recent days from companies such as Amazon, UPS, General Motors, Intel, Nestle, Target and ConocoPhillips isn\u2019t going to help the jobs market, while the rundown of pre-tariff inventories should be almost exhausted and the impact of the tariffs on inflation should become progressively clearer. The government shutdown will also have an impact on the economy, with hundreds of thousands of government employees stood down without pay and the administration withholding funds from some programs where Congress had previously approved funding. Loading The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the shutdown could cost the US economy up to $US14 billion ($21 billion) and lower December quarter GDP by one or two percentage points. While some of those impacts will be reversed when government reopens, the longer the shutdown lasts the more permanent the losses will be. Those are the key elements that created the fog Powell referred to, but there are also the massive investments pouring into artificial intelligence that are propping up US growth while disguising what\u2019s happening in the rest of the economy, where there\u2019s an element of bifurcation: AI companies and wealthier households exposed to the sharemarket and favoured by the tax cuts within Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill seem to be prospering, but lower-income households are experiencing increasing stress.\n\nThe levels of stress and the complexity of the settings that the Fed, which doesn\u2019t have the tools to target different demographic groups, finds itself in will mount further as new health insurance premiums take effect from this weekend, with big price hikes as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s cuts to healthcare funding \u2013 unless the Democrats force changes as the quid pro quo for ending the shutdown. Recent disharmony within the Fed, which has long tended to produce unanimous voting outcomes, adds another layer of uncertainty. It became evident at its September meeting that, leaving aside Miran\u2019s obvious interest in advocating for the bigger rate cuts that Trump has consistently demanded, an unusual divergence of views has developed within the 19-member open market committee. At that meeting, about half the members (excluding Miran) expected two more 25-basis-point rate cuts this year, two expected only one and seven expected none. The hawkish tone Powell adopted when talking about the prospect of a rate cut in December suggests the size of the faction arguing for no further cuts this year might have swollen, which would displease Trump.\n\nIf, as foreshadowed, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hands to Trump the name of his recommended nominee to succeed Powell late next month, there will also be a larger political dimension to the Fed\u2019s decision-making. Those on the shortlist \u2013 current Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, the director of the White House economic council Kevin Hassett, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder \u2013 would effectively become the shadow chair, with the capacity to distract and confuse as financial market participants try to determine what the Fed\u2019s policies will look like next year. The key criteria Trump wants from Powell\u2019s successor is a commitment to significantly lowering US rates, almost regardless of the economic circumstances. This week\u2019s rate cut was the primary focus for financial markets, but the Fed also announced the end, from December 1, of its quantitative-tightening program, which allowed Treasury and mortgage-backed securities it had bought to boost liquidity and lower rates during the pandemic to mature without reinvesting the proceeds.",

And we are literally desperate for some help at this point.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJamaica\u2019s Prime Minister Andrew Holness has declared a state of emergency in several parishes, describing the storm as the most powerful natural disaster in living memory.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Jamaica Defence Force has been deployed to assist with rescue and recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteorologists say Melissa\u2019s explosive strength was driven by unusually warm Caribbean waters and slow movement, which allowed it to gather energy over several days, a pattern increasingly linked to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't done yet - after ravaging Jamaica, Melissa struck eastern Cuba, but by then it had weakened to a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds of about 195 kilometres per hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Cuban authorities have reported at least 735,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas ahead of landfall.\n\n\n\n\n\nSantiago de Cuba resident Mario Arias says residents are surveying the wreckage, which includes fallen trees, power lines down, and roofs torn apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were very shocked and apprehensive, but it passed. There was a lot of wind, a lot of rain, this area was flooded - where you see now, the water reached almost knee-high. But the structures held up well because we prepared with plenty of time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Correso\u2019s home also suffered severe damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The impact was brutal. First, there was a strange calm, then suddenly it roared like a wild beast. I had to run for cover, there was nothing I could do. The roof was completely torn off, even though it was well-secured.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storm\u2019s trajectory is now pushing toward the Bahamas and possibly Bermuda, though forecasters at the US National Hurricane Center expect further weakening.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're warning of life-threatening flash floods and landslides, especially in mountainous terrain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at least 27 people are already confirmed dead across Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, with early estimates suggesting hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN's Resident Coordinator in Jamaica, Dennis Zulu, says the cleanup will be extensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From what we know thus far, there's been tremendous unprecedented devastation of infrastructure, of property, roads, network, connectivity, energy has been lost across its path. What we are seeing in preliminary assessments is a country that's been devastated to levels never seen before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Caribbean counts its losses, airports remain closed, telecommunications patchy, and recovery efforts hampered by flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season still has weeks to run, and forecasters warn Melissa may not be the last major storm this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Dennis Zulu says relief efforts are already being mobilised from hubs in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, with assistance from the World Food Programme, UNICEF, and CARICOM [[Caribbean Community]] states.\n\n\n\n",

About half the Australian economy, about nine hundred billion dollars a year, is directly dependent upon nature. A strong nature law creates a strong Australia. These laws need to be strengthened to end deforestation. As they stand these laws have too many loopholes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition says the powers provided to a new environmental protection agency proposed by the government would be too wide-ranging and risk hurting business and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Environment Minister Angie Bell says the minister's discretionary powers would be hollowed out by the new statutory body, and the bill is unworkable as it stands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill needs support in the Senate, either through the Coalition or Greens, but Ms Bell told the ABC there are limits to how much the opposition will compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese has arrived in South Korea's capital Seoul for the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum [[APEC]].\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese has also visited war graves in Seoul, commemorating the deaths of 281 Australians in the Korean War while paying his respects to the roughly 17,000 Australian men and women who fought.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he will do his best to advance Australia's national interests by establishing stronger ties with APEC nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One in four Australian jobs depends upon trade and 75 per cent of Australia's trade is with APEC Nations. This is the fastest growing region of the world in human history and this week will be an opportunity for me to advance Australia's national interests.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice in Rio de Janeiro have defended a series of raids targeting drug trafficking in the city's poor neighbourhoods, which the state's public defender's office says killed at least 132 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is travelling to Rio, and has expressed shock at the death toll, with federal authorities saying they weren't fully informed of scale of the police operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of corpses lining the streets have led to questions about police conduct, prompting this response from Rio de Janeiro's Secretary of Public Security, Felipe Curi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we did yesterday was a legitimate action by the state to enforce court orders, 180 search and seizure warrants, and about 100 arrest warrants. Those who chose to confront us were neutralised. The police's reaction depends on the criminal's actions. It's that simple. I also want to address those who have labelled or attempted to label this operation as a massacre in a malicious way. A massacre is the indiscriminate, illegal killing of several people at the same time, in a random manner.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia have been left frustrated after rain washed out the Twenty20 series opener against Australia at a cold and dreary Manuka Oval in Canberra on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visitors had started strongly, surging to 1-97 off 9.4 overs, when the heavens opened - denying a sold-out crowd the sight of fast bowling superstar Jasprit Bumrah.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite winning the three-match one-day international series between the two sides 2-1, Australia will face a tough fight for victory in the remaining four matches against the reigning T20 world champions.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Health Minister Mark Butler has condemned attempts by several backbench Coalition MPs to \"conflate\" stillbirths and late-term abortions in the context of proposed leave entitlements, as amounting to \"deeply cynical politicking\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Hastie, Tony Pasin, Henry Pike and Barnaby Joyce all used speeches in the federation chamber of parliament on Wednesday to suggest new laws ensuring women who experience a stillbirth or neonatal death will retain access to maternity leave could have \"unintended consequences\".\n\n\n\n\n\n'Baby Priya's Bill' was spurred by the case of a mother, who, after informing her employer of 11 years that her infant daughter Priya had died at just 42 days old, was faced with negotiating a return-to-work timeline she hadn't planned for \u2014 while simultaneously grieving her loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt introduces a new principle into the Fair Work Act that employer-funded paid parental leave must not be cancelled because a child is stillborn or dies, attracting bipartisan commitment before the last election.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New workplace laws aim to remove extra pain burden on parents arising from stillbirth SBS News 04:34 English\n\nEmployment Minister Amanda Rishworth said its purpose is to \"ensure there is greater clarity regarding employer-funded paid parental leave for parents dealing with the tragedy of stillbirth or the death of a child\" and give \"certainty to grieving parents at the most difficult time of their life\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, more than 3,000 families lost a child to stillbirth or within the first 28 days of their birth, according to data by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nHastie affirmed the \"intent\" of the bill in principle, but said he felt it necessary to question its potential \"unintended consequences\" \u2014 a claim also made against the Stillborn Baby Payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This place is a place where we can come, and we can express views according to conscience. And it's no secret that I'm opposed to late-term abortions,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a noble and good thing and Baby Priya's Bill deserves our support for that reason \u2026 I note the sensitivity around this, but I do call upon the government to clarify that it does not apply to late-term abortions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPasin, as well as estranged Nationals backbencher Joyce , also expressed concern over its scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It should be available to people who wish to be parents, but for the grace of God, have not become parents through that incident or outcome,\" Pasin said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could abortion rights ever be reversed in Australia like in the US?\n\nJoyce said: \"The day after a child is born, no matter what medical conditions or impairments that may be there, you have no right to interfere in their life. And therefore, the day before, we believe, is the same.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Butler has rejected the conflations, defending the definitions in the bill as \"very clear\" and noting a termination is \"very different\" to a stillbirth or neonatal death that occurs as a result of a \"natural spontaneous event\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To try to conflate the two things is, I think, a very cynical, deeply distressing political exercise,\" he told ABC's Afternoon Briefing on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The men who are doing this \u2014 and they're all men \u2014 know the difference between stillbirth and abortion.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The $920m plan for extra paid leave that could save Australia billions a year\n\n\"How often, when we're talking about constraining women's rights, constraining women's support through these incredibly important and at times distressing events in their life, it's men leading the charge? I haven't heard a Coalition woman go into the chamber and make these arguments,\" Butler said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal senator Jane Hume said she hadn't heard her colleagues' contributions delivered in the chamber, but cautioned against the debate being turned into \"a political football\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Opposition spokesperson told SBS News that while \"members of the Liberal and National parties have always had the right to express a view ... the Coalition has agreed to the passage of this bill\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bill has gone through its usual processes and had strong support from the party room.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians are having fewer children than ever. At 1.5 babies per woman, the fertility rate is at a record low. Many attribute this to the cost of having and raising children.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is true, it raises questions of intergenerational fairness and future planning for governments. What do we do about the young would-be parents who are opting out because it\u2019s simply too expensive?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with this assumption is that while it may feel true that childbearing must have become more expensive over the decades, it\u2019s not that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what do parents have to fork out to raise children, how do we measure it, and are kids really that much more expensive now than they used to be?\n\n\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nCalculating the cost of raising kids is a complicated beast that raises many questions for academics to consider. Is a second child less expensive than a first child? Are older children more expensive than younger children? Do higher income families spend more on children than lower income families, and what share of that spending is necessary compared to discretionary?\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are debates in the literature for which there aren\u2019t necessarily clear answers, in spite of much research.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers also contest whether we should talk about just the direct cost, or if we should also consider the indirect costs, such as the impact on hours in paid work or the loss of leisure time for busy parents. We focus here and in our paper for the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee on the direct costs.\n\n\n\nAustralia's fertility rates have been on a downward trajectory over time. Source: SBS News One way, and probably the more intuitive, is the \u201cbudget standards\u201d approach. This puts a value on the cost of a basket of goods and services for a family with and without children. The difference is the cost of children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems simple, until it\u2019s not. For example, do you need a fourth bedroom for a third child? Do you need a bigger car? A larger fridge? Private or public school? Childcare or at home care? What about hand-me-down clothes and toys?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach, which is our focus, is a survey-based statistical method (or \u201ciso-welfare\u201d in technical terms) comparing living standards of different households. We ask how much more income (or spending) is required to ensure the same living standard between a family with children and a family without children.\n\n\n\nLiving standards are measured by what share of total household income or expenditure is spent on basic items, such as food or utilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logic here is that a family that spends a lower share (on average) on basic goods has a higher standard of living than a family that spends a higher share on basic goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest high quality survey on expenditure in Australia is now ten years old, so in our latest research we\u2019ve taken a new approach. We use financial stress as a measure of living standards instead.\n\n\n\nUsing Housing Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) data, we model financial stress against income and a range of other household variables and estimate how much extra disposable income a family with children needs to maintain the same living standard as a couple without children. That extra income is considered the cost of children.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are many advantages to using this method, a major drawback is that it doesn\u2019t give you an estimate for how much a family needs to spend, rather how much they do spend. Families may well spend more than what they strictly need to.\n\n\n\nSo, how much do families spend on children?\n\nWe estimate families spend about 13 per cent of their disposable income on the first child and a further ten percentage points for each child after that.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a working-age couple earning the typical after-tax income (around $130,000 per year), that equates to about $17,000 per year for the first child and around $13,000 per year for each subsequent child.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means to raise the eldest child to adulthood, the couple would spend about $300,000 over 18 years in today\u2019s dollars. Subsequent children would be about $230,000 each.\n\n\n\n\n\nLower income families spend a higher share of their income on children, at around 17 per cent for the first child and 13 per cent for subsequent children. But these households spend a lower absolute amount on children.\n\n\n\nDoes age of the child change the cost? There is uncertainty around this, but our latest research indicates younger children and older children are moderately more expensive than middle aged (six to 12) children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis finding contrasts with previous research and conventional wisdom that older children are the most expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese estimates are not set in stone. There are different ways to estimate such numbers and they can differ depending on what definitions you adopt and methods you use to analyse the data.\n\n\n\nOk, do kids cost more now?\n\nThe HILDA dataset has been gathered over many years, so we can compare the cost of children through time, albeit not perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle year samples are relatively small and subject to error, but that analysis suggests not a lot has changed with the cost of children since 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research doesn\u2019t provide clues as to why fertility rates in Australia have dropped (as they have in most developed nations). Other data such as Australian Bureau of Statistics income survey and financial stress data suggest real incomes for couples with children have increased over the longer term (although not by much, if at all, in recent years).\n\n\n\nThe lack of evidence here likely points to other factors driving lower fertility rates. Families may be delaying having children to focus on other pursuits, such as employment or education. It\u2019s also more acceptable for couples, and women in particular, to choose to not have children.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother possible reason is people could be being deterred by the perception of higher costs, instead of the actual cost. Or perhaps people simply want to spend their money elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the cost of children is complex and imprecise, but it\u2019s fair to say the evidence doesn\u2019t show that the direct cost of kids is getting more expensive over time. Younger generations not having kids, or fewer kids, is likely related to many factors, but we can\u2019t draw affordability down generational lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Phillips is an associate professor at POLIS@ANU Centre for social policy research at Australian National University. Phillips through his role at the ANU provides consulting services on a range of areas in economic and social policy and has recently published work on a consulting basis for the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee on the cost of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Labor is determined to deliver the largest reform to Australia's environmental laws in 26 years by Christmas, in the key test for Environment Minister Murray Watt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is anticipating that the tranche of reforms, to be tabled in parliament on Thursday morning, will be sent to a Senate inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it remains confident it can reach its Christmas deadline by striking a deal with the Coalition or the Greens, both of which remain viable options as discussions continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt says suggestions on how to change the laws have been circulating parliament for five years, following a review by Graeme Samuel in 2020, since which \"we've seen our environment go backwards\".\n\n\n\n\"If we can't get a deal by Christmas, then I think that will be a real indictment on the Coalition and the Greens,\" he told SBS News, although he did not elaborate on what the government might do if it fails to pass them by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will be another demonstration that they haven't heard the message from the last election, which was that people wanted to see parties working together to produce outcomes rather than blocking progress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government estimates the reforms could inject up to $7 billion into the economy, according to analysis by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what we know about the laws and the key concerns around them.\n\n\n\nWhat's inside Labor's environment laws 2.0?\n\nIt's Labor's second attempt at reforming the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, after Watt's predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, failed to strike a deal last term.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor says the overhaul, split into seven bills, will largely follow recommendations from the Samuel Review, tabled by then-environment minister and current Opposition leader Sussan Ley.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of national environmental standards will give clear parameters about what needs to be done to protect nature and receive project approval.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed changes include an \"unacceptable impact\" test for high-polluting projects, requiring companies to disclose expected emissions and set up carbon abatement plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be stiffer penalties for environmental regulatory violations, including fines of up to $825 million.\n\n\n\nThe government says the reforms will create more efficient assessments, cutting down approval times from decades to years, years to months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is partially due to the new system of accreditation, where bilateral agreements will be struck with states and territories, allowing them the capacity to make assessments under the new national standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow approval times for projects, including the duplication of processes across state and federal governments, have been partially blamed for holding up renewable energy projects as well as the mining of minerals that will allow Australia to compete with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government plans to establish the nation's first-ever National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), tasked with ensuring compliance under the proposed new laws and greater accountability.\n\n\n\nThe environment minister will have the power to reject project developments if they are deemed to do serious damage to nature or push through projects in \"the national interest\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a 28-day time limit to challenge the minister's decision, during which work can continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has also committed to providing standards for engaging with First Nations people, ensuring they are consulted early on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's only red line so far is a climate trigger proposed by the Greens, with the reforms instead opting to require an emissions disclosure as advised by the Samuel Review.\n\n\n\nWhat are the Coalition and Greens' concerns?\n\nThe Coalition argues that the reforms in their current form are unworkable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have raised specific concerns about the NEPA's authority, requesting that its CEO be accountable to the minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are also seeking clarity around the net gain definition, which would require developers to show they've tried to avoid and mitigate impacts on nature before buying offsets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition environment spokesperson Angie Bell is focused on ensuring reforms streamline approvals and give certainty to business, while \"improving environmental protections\".\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Greens argue the reforms are catering to big business and creating more loopholes that weaken environmental protections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are critical of the environment minister having power to fast-track projects in the national interest, with concerns that it's a loophole for more damaging coal, gas and logging projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters says the party is still open to negotiations with Labor as long as the reforms \"work for nature\", but warns they're \"riddled with loopholes\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rather than fix those loopholes, the proposal by this environment minister under this government is to add additional loopholes and yet more fast-track mechanisms for coal and gas,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've also highlighted that the new laws do not address native forest logging, with deforestation a major driver of species extinction and carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn audit has begun into the design and delivery of the Federal Government's Housing Australia Future Fund also known as H-A-F-F.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablished in 2023, it's aim was to address Australia's housing crisis by providing funding to boost the supply of social and affordable homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt started off with $10 billion and was aiming to build 40,000 social and affordable rental homes over five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fund is under pressure for spending the equivalent of only eight Sydney homes last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow minister for housing and homelessness Andrew Bragg is calling it one of the biggest public policy disasters of his lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is wasting taxpayer funds, it is overpaying for houses, in some cases, it's going to be paying more than $1.3 million per house when the average cost of a house in Australia is about $500,000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAuditor-General Caralee McLiesh announced the nine-month audit is underway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe audit increases pressure on the fund, whose Chair, Carol Austin, resigned this month amid a probe into allegations of bullying.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Treasurer Ben Mulino backs the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia Future Fund is a well designed scheme that has already seen a very significant number of housing projects approved. I've seen a number of those in my own electorate. I've been at events with the Minister for Housing, where I've seen very substantial developments which will provide homes for people in fantastic areas, social and affordable housing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing minister Clare O'Neil is blaming the Opposition and the Greens for delaying the fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe claims the 55,000 affordable homes were far better than the 373 social and affordable homes built by the Coalition in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The historic package that our government is implementing, is focused primarily on building more homes for Australians. We're doing that by building 55,000 social and affordable homes, something the Greens political party did everything to stop us doing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens Senator Barbara Pocock has welcomed the audit, arguing the fund has always been too complex and too slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why isn't the government investing directly in public and community housing? They should be directly putting their money into public and community housing. It's faster, cheaper, and it worked the last time Australia faced a housing crisis in the post war years. We know we can do it. We've done it before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKristin O'Connell from the Anti-poverty Institute agrees with the sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe warns, however, that the difference between public, community, and affordable housing may not be clear to people who don't need low-cost accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Public housing is something that we used to have a lot of in this country, and lots of different types of people lived in it. It is owned by the government, rented from the government, and you pay rent, no matter who you are, if you live in it, when we look at community housing that is often being run by church organisations. We operation being run by church organisations and other corporate charities that are very large scale and operate in very similar ways to property developers. It's really focused on building up an asset portfolio, you have less security of tenure that means that the community housing landlord has more reasons and more ways they can evict you than your public housing, landlord.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the Housing Australia Future Fund is structured to incentivise maximum returns for developers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis encourages them to build homes with market-tied, \"fake affordable\" rents instead of genuinely affordable, income-tied community housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor public housing, Ms. O'Connell believes the fund provides no incentive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are zero incentives for anyone to build public housing, because the whole thing incentivises state governments to sell off and privatise their public housing and replace it with Community Housing instead. So not only are the people who are accessing the fund more likely to try and build things that will get them higher rent, we also have state governments advocating responsibility and public housing tenants across the country losing their homes with the help of the federal Government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also points out that affordable housing has income caps and is tied to market rents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Affordable housing isn't what they call it. It's not affordable if you live in a place like Sydney, where market rent for a one bedroom apartment is $600, your so called affordable housing is going to be $500 for a one bedroom apartment.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has responded to the intensifying storm around its $4 million website redesign as pressure for changes continues to mount.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BoM unveiled its first website revamp in 12 years last week, but it quickly came under fire after savage storms left a trail of destruction across the eastern seaboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers complained the new website did not indicate storm severity after wild weather wreaked havoc across Queensland and Victoria at the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the BoM's acting CEO Peter Stone said he acknowledged community concerns and \"the significance of the change\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't make the change lightly and we appreciate that it will take time for some to adjust. I sincerely apologise for the challenges the change has caused,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"It's clear we need to do more to help people through the change, both by making adjustments to the website and by helping users to understand its new features,\" Stone said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows Environment Minister Murray Watt's meeting with Stone on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt said in a statement following that it was clear the new website wasn't meeting community expectations and that he had told the acting CEO needed to consider feedback and \"where appropriate, adjust the website's settings as soon as possible\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt has also been under pressure to push for change after Queensland treasurer David Janetzki wrote to him, saying the revamp, just before the start of the main storm season, can, \"at its best, be described as short-sighted\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, Nationals leader David Littleproud also said he had written to Watt after he'd received complaints from locals in his regional Queensland electorate of Marnoa.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the locals complained the new website was difficult to navigate and lacked key tools, including the ability to enter GPS coordinates for specific property locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a result, families, business and farmers are unable to access vital localised data such as river heights and rainfall information,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud said he had asked Watt \"to review the functionality of the updated BoM website and consider restoring key tools relied upon by farmers and rural communities\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe suggested BoM's management needed to improve and accused them of running a business model of \"fail and simply ask for more money\", and of poor forecasting that had, at times, caused confusion among farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can't even manage to put a simple website together,\" Littleproud told reporters.\n\n\n\nAnthony Cornelius, managing director at forecasting company Weatherwatch, has also been critical. In a post on LinkedIn on Monday, he said there were three major issues users were finding: the new radar underestimated storm intensity, it lagged, and the new design made it difficult to find information when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It beggars belief that the BoM would roll out such a significant change to an essential infrastructure service just as the main storm season is about to start,\" Cornelius said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his statement on Wednesday afternoon, Stone said: \"The safety of Australians is our primary concern.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to reiterate that observations, forecasts, warnings and severe weather updates continue to be readily available on our website, the app and our social media channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There has been significant feedback about the radar on the new website. It's important to note that the website radar provides one view of the current weather situation. It is not intended to replicate or replace the Bureau's weather warnings which are created by our expert meteorologists and issued ahead of a severe weather event.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStone said the BoM welcomed feedback on the new website and was \"moving quickly\" to act on that already received.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am confident the community will start to see more improvements in the coming weeks.\"\n\n\n\n",

Despite wins over Japan and Saudi Arabia in World Cup qualification, and in the two-match Soccer Ashes series against New Zealand, Popovic came away a little disappointed, feeling that they were missing what he described as a quintessentially Australian characteristic. Christian Pulisic was injured against the Socceroos.

But we can\u2019t forget what makes us, what\u2019s our DNA. And I think we\u2019ve gone away from that. I thought the first game against New Zealand, to an extent, we almost got bullied in the game. And I can\u2019t fathom that, how that can happen with Australians.\u201d\n\nPopovic doesn\u2019t want them to play recklessly, but believes a more hard-nosed approach can actually enhance those other, newer qualities. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win, and we shouldn\u2019t forget that side of us,\u201d he said. Jordan Bos takes on two Americans. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYou can see through the whole country, from grassroots all the way through, we\u2019re trying to develop a better style of play \u2013 but we can\u2019t forget that. Because if you look at all the best teams in the world, when they lose a game, the coach will come out and say: \u2018We didn\u2019t win our duels, we didn\u2019t win our second balls, so we couldn\u2019t maintain momentum, or we couldn\u2019t maintain the pressure. We\u2019re too soft.\u2019 \u201cReally, it should be expected that we do that. So from now on, I expect to see that.\u201d\n\nMore than a year on from assuming the role, Popovic has settled into it beautifully. As he held court in an hour-long press conference this week, there was no evasiveness and no defensiveness. He answered every question directly and expansively, covering off a range of topics: himself, the mistakes he\u2019s made, Australia\u2019s broader talent pool and their connection with mainstream audiences, his ambitions for the team and belief in it, what he wants to see from younger players, the structural factors in the domestic game that are holding them back, and his definition of leadership. \u2018If they want to play at a World Cup ... their level needs to be the highest they\u2019ve ever had. Any shorter than that will leave you out.\u2019 Tony Popovic OK, maybe there was a bit of evasiveness when he was asked about his future, since his contract expires at the end of the World Cup \u2013 but even as he predictably described it as a bridge he\u2019d cross when he comes to it, he also said he felt it was his \u201cduty\u201d to plan as if he would be there beyond that, to prepare for the 2027 Asian Cup and the next World Cup cycle. And you could tell how seriously he takes that duty. In his embrace of the pressure of the role, the gravitas with which he carries himself, and the magnitude of his vision, Popovic is Postecoglou-esque.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a burden for me,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cI don\u2019t carry extra weight because I\u2019m the Socceroos coach. I carry joy, and it\u2019s a pleasure, and there\u2019s nothing difficult about it for me. There are challenges, but there are challenges in every job. \u201cI love this job. I\u2019m honoured. I love the responsibility.\u201d On the matter of his World Cup squad and the jostling for positions in it, Popovic is keeping an open mind, staying alive to the possibility that someone could come from the clouds and unseat an established star. Whoever makes the cut will know exactly what is expected of them: everything.\n\n\u201cThe key is that if they want to play at a World Cup, they have to understand that their level needs to be the highest they\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cAny shorter than that will leave you out of the World Cup.\u201d Loading His dream, he said, was for the Socceroos to be consistently mixing it with the world\u2019s best. To no longer be considered underdogs. And he doesn\u2019t want to wait until he\u2019s an old man sitting on his couch to see it. \u201cI keep saying it to the group: one day, Australia will go very far in the World Cup. Why not this group?\u201d Popovic said.",

        "text": "Without data on inflation and unemployment \u2013 the two key metrics the Fed needs to manage with its dual mandate of maximising employment while maintaining stable prices \u2013 its policymakers are flying blind, which Powell conceded might influence the outcome of the December meeting. Loading \u201cWhat do you do if you\u2019re driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to that. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s certainly a possibility that you would say \u2018we really can\u2019t see. So let\u2019s slow down\u2019.\u201d Even leaving aside the impact of the dearth of data for an institution that prides itself on being data-driven, there would be no certainty of a December cut.\n\nThe decision to trim the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, the second rate cut this year, wasn\u2019t unanimous. Trump\u2019s man inside the Fed, Stephen Miran, who may be warming the seat for Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed Powell when he is scheduled to retire next May, voted for a 50-basis-point cut for the second time in the two meetings he has attended. Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid voted for no change, and Powell indicated there were others who would like the Fed to move cautiously. \u201cFor some part of the committee, it\u2019s time to maybe take a step back and see whether there really are downside risks to the labour market, or see whether in fact, the stronger growth that we\u2019re seeing is real,\u201d he said. \u2018A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\u2019 Fed chair Jerome Powell Complicating the Fed\u2019s task is that, while America\u2019s unemployment rate was rising (despite Trump\u2019s draconian immigration policies that are shrinking the pool of available labour) before the shutdown\u2019s data blackout, so is inflation, as the impact of his tariffs slowly bleeds through into prices that, since mid-year, have been steadily edging up with each release of the inflation data.\n\nA slew of big job cuts in recent days from companies such as Amazon, UPS, General Motors, Intel, Nestle, Target and ConocoPhillips isn\u2019t going to help the jobs market, while the rundown of pre-tariff inventories should be almost exhausted and the impact of the tariffs on inflation should become progressively clearer. The government shutdown will also have an impact on the economy, with hundreds of thousands of government employees stood down without pay and the administration withholding funds from some programs where Congress had previously approved funding. Loading The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the shutdown could cost the US economy up to $US14 billion ($21 billion) and lower December quarter GDP by one or two percentage points. While some of those impacts will be reversed when government reopens, the longer the shutdown lasts the more permanent the losses will be. Those are the key elements that created the fog Powell referred to, but there are also the massive investments pouring into artificial intelligence that are propping up US growth while disguising what\u2019s happening in the rest of the economy, where there\u2019s an element of bifurcation: AI companies and wealthier households exposed to the sharemarket and favoured by the tax cuts within Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill seem to be prospering, but lower-income households are experiencing increasing stress.\n\nThe levels of stress and the complexity of the settings that the Fed, which doesn\u2019t have the tools to target different demographic groups, finds itself in will mount further as new health insurance premiums take effect from this weekend, with big price hikes as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s cuts to healthcare funding \u2013 unless the Democrats force changes as the quid pro quo for ending the shutdown. Recent disharmony within the Fed, which has long tended to produce unanimous voting outcomes, adds another layer of uncertainty. It became evident at its September meeting that, leaving aside Miran\u2019s obvious interest in advocating for the bigger rate cuts that Trump has consistently demanded, an unusual divergence of views has developed within the 19-member open market committee. At that meeting, about half the members (excluding Miran) expected two more 25-basis-point rate cuts this year, two expected only one and seven expected none. The hawkish tone Powell adopted when talking about the prospect of a rate cut in December suggests the size of the faction arguing for no further cuts this year might have swollen, which would displease Trump.\n\nIf, as foreshadowed, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hands to Trump the name of his recommended nominee to succeed Powell late next month, there will also be a larger political dimension to the Fed\u2019s decision-making. Those on the shortlist \u2013 current Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, the director of the White House economic council Kevin Hassett, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder \u2013 would effectively become the shadow chair, with the capacity to distract and confuse as financial market participants try to determine what the Fed\u2019s policies will look like next year. The key criteria Trump wants from Powell\u2019s successor is a commitment to significantly lowering US rates, almost regardless of the economic circumstances. This week\u2019s rate cut was the primary focus for financial markets, but the Fed also announced the end, from December 1, of its quantitative-tightening program, which allowed Treasury and mortgage-backed securities it had bought to boost liquidity and lower rates during the pandemic to mature without reinvesting the proceeds.",
