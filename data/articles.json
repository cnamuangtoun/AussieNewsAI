        "text": "The US track championships turned physical on Monday, Australia time, with Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek getting involved in a shoving and shouting match as they crossed the finish line of a hotly contested 200 metre final at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nLyles landed the day's biggest blow on the track, passing Bednarek for the win, then looked his way to talk some trash.\n\nBednarek's answer was a two-handed shove in the back after the finish line, some more heated words and a challenge for a rematch that cannot come soon enough.\n\n\" Like I've said before, Noah's going to be Noah,\" Bednarek said. \"If he wants to stare me down, that's fine. \"\n\nLyles reeled in Bednarek and crossed in 19.63 seconds for a 0.04-second victory that sets up a rematch at the World Athletics Championships on September 19 in Tokyo.\n\nThe best action in Round 1 of the 2025 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships came after the finish line. There was jawing, the shove and, then, Lyles turning around, back-pedalling, reaching his arms out and bouncing up and down like a boxer before lobbing a few more choice words at Bednarek.\n\nTheir argument bled into the start of what is normally a celebratory NBC winner's interview.\n\nBednarek has taken exception to Lyles's actions during the final few metres of the 200m final. (Getty Images: Patrick Smith)\n\n\"I tell ya, if you've got a problem, I expect a call,\" Bednarek said, as the network's Lewis Johnson moved the mic between the runners.\n\nLyles replied: \"You know what, you're right. You're right. Let's talk after this.\"\n\nThough they shook hands during that tense post-race exchange, Bednarek was fired up well after the sprinters had left the track.\n\n\"The summary is, don't do that to me,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't do any of that stuff. It's not good character right there. That's pretty much it. At the end of the day, he won the race. I've got to give him props. He was the better man today.\"\n\nThe win itself was no big surprise for Lyles, the three-time defending world champion who will have to get past Bednarek to make it four in Tokyo.\n\nBednarek was asked what Lyles said as he turned around and gloated after securing his fifth national title at his favourite distance.\n\n\"What he said didn't matter; it's just what he did,\" Bednarek said.\n\n\" Unsportsmanlike [expletive] and I don't deal with that. It's a respect factor. He's fresh. Last time we lined it up, I beat him, that's all I can say. Next time we line up, I'm going to win. That's all that matters. \"\n\nAsked to expand on his role in the tiff, Lyles was less forthcoming: \"On coach's orders, no comment.\"\n\nAs is common in a year after the Olympics \u2014 and in an era after Usain Bolt \u2014 track is a sport desperately in need of some energy. Who else to provide it than Lyles, the sport's most engaging character this side of Sha'Carri Richardson, who found herself in off-the-track headlines again this weekend.\n\nUp to now, track media and the runners themselves have tried to generate rivalries between Lyles and Erriyon Knighton (fizzled), or Lyles and Letsile Tebogo (beat him in the Olympics last year), or, of course, between Lyles and NFL receiver Tyreek Hill (supposed grudge match never took place).\n\nTurns out, they probably should have looked at the lane next to him. Bednarek has won silver and beaten Lyles the last two times they have lined up in the 200m at the Olympics, even though Lyles has had issues at both \u2014 in Tokyo with his mental health, then in Paris with COVID.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nBednarek referenced some long-simmering issues between the two.\n\n\"Just some personal stuff we've got to handle,\" he said.\n\nBut when asked for something, anything, about this burgeoning rivalry, Lyles demurred, instead focusing on what a difficult year this has been for him after an injury in April kept him out of spikes until June.\n\n\"If they ain't going to beat me now, they ain't going to beat me ever,\" Lyles said.\n\nBednarek is not so sure of that.\n\nThe 200m final was Bednarek's fifth race of the week, counting the three heats of the 100 meters, where he won the final Friday. Lyles, who has an automatic spot at worlds in that event as the defending champion, only ran one heat of the 100m.\n\n\"We'll go fresh and we'll see what happens,\" Bednarek said. \"Because I'm very confident I can beat him. That's all I can say.\"\n\nRichardson fails to qualify for 200m final\n\nSha'Carri Richardson narrowly missed qualifying for the 200m final on Monday (AEST), concluding what's been a tumultuous week for the sprinter in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRichardson wound up fourth in her heat in a time of 22.56 seconds. The top two finishers in each heat advance, along with the next three fastest times. Madison Whyte edged her out on time by running 22.55 seconds in the same heat.\n\nA week ago, Richardson was arrested on a fourth-degree domestic violence offence for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman, at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. She was booked into South Correctional Entity (SCORE) in Des Moines, Washington, for more than 18 hours.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson failed to qualify for the 200m final after a tumultuous week. (Getty Images: Patrick Smith)\n\nDays later, Richardson, 25, ran the opening round of the 100m at nationals before withdrawing from the event. She has an automatic spot to worlds next month in Tokyo as the defending 100m champion.\n\nThis was Richardson's first 200m race of the season. She won a bronze medal at the distance during the 2023 world championships in Budapest.\n\nIt was part of a stellar showing at worlds that season, as she also won the 100 and helped the 4x100 relay to a gold. A year later, Richardson finished with the silver medal in the 100 at the Paris Games.\n\nRichardson had a positive marijuana test at the 2021 US Olympic trials and did not compete at the Tokyo Games.",

(ABC Kimberley: Courtney Fowler)\n\nOn and off again market\n\nIndia was the choice destination for Australian chickpea exporters for years, enjoying tariff-free access to the world's largest consumer of the legume.\n\nBut in 2017, amid growing pressure to stabilise prices and support domestic farmers, India introduced large tariffs on chickpea imports, effectively killing the trade.\n\nAustralian production plummeted \u2014 that year the crop was more than 2 million tonnes, but by 2023 it had shrunk to 500,000 tonnes.\n\nEven Australia's free trade agreement with India signed in 2022 failed to reinstate the trade.\n\nThe industry scrambled to diversify its markets, and now exports chickpeas to Bangladesh, Pakistan and Jebel Ali in the Middle East.\n\nThen, in May 2024, India made a surprise announcement \u2014 Australia could once again send tariff-free chickpeas, but only if they arrived before the end of March 2025.\n\nThe south Asian country was desperate to secure supply as it faced one of its lowest crops in five years due to bad weather.\n\nThe announcement came just as Australian farmers were deciding what to plant for winter, kicking off a race to get crops to the sub-continent by the tight deadline.\n\nA chickpea crop planted in central Queensland. (ABC News: Megan Hughes)\n\nPrices skyrocketed, and despite wild storms, logistics issues and worker strikes, Australia's Pulse Council Chair Peter Wilson said about 2 million tonnes made it in before the deadline.\n\n\"Some of the best desi chickpeas I've ever seen were produced in the 2024 early 2025 season,\" he said.\n\n\"They were hard, they were well filled, they were a beautiful colour.\"\n\nIndia eventually reinstated its tariffs but not to the level they were before \u2014 offering 10 per cent rather than the 66 per cent that had effectively been in place.\n\n'Open book consideration'\n\nMr Wilson said planting conditions were ideal in the northern growing area in Queensland thanks to a wet summer, which had growers' decision-making.\n\n\"It's been an open book consideration because there's been adequate profile moisture,\" he said.\n\n\" When you have that farmers will consider all of their options. \"\n\nThe first region to harvest is usually central Queensland in spring. (ABC News: Lara Webster)\n\nMr Wilson said while prices had eased from last season's highs of $1,100 a tonne, they were still sitting strong at $700 a tonne.\n\nOn top of a positive economic environment, Mr Bourne said his chickpeas were also benefiting from good weather.\n\n\"We're looking very good, probably one of the best ever [years], actually,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got ample moisture; the first lot of chickpeas we planted are just starting to get a nice foliage on them.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can get a dry October and November at harvest time.\"\n\nRhys Daniels has planted both wheat and chickpeas this winter season. (ABC News: Megan Hughes)\n\nRhys Daniels has a mixed cropping and cattle operation more than 100 kilometres south of Mr Bourne's, at Capella.\n\nThis winter he is growing wheat and chickpeas, but says he understands why Mr Bourne has gone all in.\n\n\"It's been a pretty blessed year really, we've had lots of rain when other people haven't,\" he said.\n\n\" The gross margin for chickpeas blows pretty much everything else out of the water in dryland. \"\n\nMr Daniels's family has grown the legume since the 1990s, and he said they had seen some great years.\n\n\"2016 was a stand-out year with record yields and a record price,\" he said.\n\n\"It really redefined what we actually could grow out of chickpea, the price skyrocketed to $1100 a tonne.\"\n\n\"It was pretty exciting.\"\n\nAround 2 million tonnes of Australian chickpeas went to India last season. (Supplied)\n\nWhile Queensland is starting off strong, Mr Wilson said Western Australia was doing \"okay\" and Victoria and South Australia were suffering with drought.\n\n\"Conditions were still very, very dry there, most of the crop went in dry,\" he said.\n\n\"We've had a couple of shots of rain through the south-east now, crops are out of the ground, but they're juvenile and they just don't have a lot of moisture underneath them.\"\n\nHe said harvesting was still weeks away.\n\n\"Lots of things need to go well for us to have good outcomes,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the conditions are set up for another decent year.\"",

On the back of her right arm is a tattoo of a bounding Kangaroo.\n\n\"Well, it was tattoo Tuesday,\" Garner told ABC Sport.\n\nThe Tuesday being the one after her side won North Melbourne's maiden AFLW premiership last year.\n\n\"We had the Saturday night [after the win], then we had the Sunday, and we had Monday, and so we were all a bit hungover.\n\n\"But I think most of the group got it. It was either here on the ankle, few on the ribs \u2026 We were like, 'We kind of have to do it. It's the first ever premiership for the club.'\"\n\nJas Garner will lead North Melbourne into the season as reining premiers. (Getty: Mike Owen)\n\nThe historic flag came after an undefeated run in which North Melbourne toppled the then-reigning premier Brisbane in the final.\n\nThey were heavy favourites to do so, even before the season started, after making their maiden grand final the year before, where they fell short to the Lions.\n\nHowever, despite being heavily revered by the rest of the competition and wider footballing community, the dream run wasn't always a flawless one.\n\nIn week five against Richmond during the condensed fixture, the Kangaroos recorded their lowest score for the season with just three goals to edge a win.\n\nNorth Melbourne went undefeated in 2024 to claim a maiden AFLW premiership. (Getty: Dylan Burns/AFL Photos)\n\nAnd in week two, they drew with Geelong in a bruising clash.\n\n\"It didn't feel like that throughout the year [that we were unstoppable],\" Garner said.\n\n\"We didn't come in after a game that we'd won and been like, 'OK, this is what we did. Well, we're fine.'\n\n\"We'd break it down into quarters \u2026 It wasn't like, 'Yeah, we've got the four points, everything's going so well.'\n\n\"Because definitely last year we had some games where we weren't playing great footy. But it was just finding ways to stay in the game, and then when you've got momentum, making the most of it.\n\n\"It was the first final against Adelaide at [Princes Park], I remember the first half, a lot of it they controlled. It was like, 'Why couldn't we get the ball out?' And then in the second half, we were able to get the win.\"\n\nJas Garner was best on ground in the 2024 grand final against Brisbane. (Getty: Morgan Hancock/AFL Photos)\n\nThis year, not only will North Melbourne be hunted more than ever, Garner will also have the added responsibility of guiding the side through its premiership defence as captain, after taking the reins as skipper from veteran Emma Kearney.\n\nShe adds the captaincy to her resume, which now features a premiership, a grand final best on ground, six All Australians and four club best and fairests.\n\nNorth Melbourne women's team break club premiership drought Photo shows North Melbourne win the 2024 AFLW premiership cup. North Melbourne dominate Brisbane in the AFLW grand final to win first flag by an expansion club.\n\nHowever, the lengthy list of accolades doesn't mean Garner is getting complacent.\n\n\"If you don't do the extra work, you don't get fit, get strong, you will get left behind,\" she said.\n\n\"Every year you're just finding something different to get better at, to stay up with the elite.\"\n\nWhat is she working on right now?\n\n\"I think just every year, I'm trying to get fitter at my running,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that's what I've been able to do when I moved into the midfield and just keep building that engine.\n\n\"Because the best midfielders in the comp are usually good runners \u2026 So, just trying to stay strong.\"\n\nJasmine Garner took over the captaincy from Emma Kearney for the 2025 season. (Getty:Dylan Burns/AFL Photos)\n\nThere's also a small \"35\" tattoo inked on her wrist, and another on her ribs.\n\n\"All of a sudden, I'd got three new tattoos. I'm like, 'I was addicted',\" she joked.\n\nNow, the question will be if another bounding Kangaroo will join the first if her side can manage to go back-to-back this year after finally getting a taste of premiership success. They are tipped by many to do so.\n\nThe Kangaroos' 2025 campaign begins against Geelong on August 16.",

(Supplied: City of Karratha)\n\nFestival attendee Sherry Fitzgerald has participated in the event for nearly 20 years and wants to see the public holiday tradition continue.\n\n\"It just brings everybody together, everybody is friendly,\" she said.\n\n\" Let us have our little tradition in the Pilbara. \"\n\nBut others, like Hannah Whelan, believe \"it isn't really fair\" the holiday falls at a different time to the rest of the state.\n\nHannah Whelan believes it's unfair for families living across regions to have different public holiday dates. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\n\"People should be able to have the same long weekend as the rest of the state so they can make the most of it, visiting their family if they want to.\"\n\n'It's a bit strange to me,\" she said.\n\nDisruptive for business\n\nWhile some local businesses take the public holiday, others still choose to observe the September public holiday date.\n\nThe public holiday in Karratha will be reviewed again after 2027. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nCity of Karratha Mayor Daniel Scott said it depended on the company and the choice of the employer, with some businesses even choosing to take both public holidays.\n\n\"If businesses take advantage, their employees manage to get an extra public holiday than everyone else in the state,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he noted the holiday can be disruptive for bigger companies.\n\n\"There are a lot of businesses that obviously operate in Perth and also have links over the eastern states as well, so it can disrupt a few businesses because they like to have their public holidays all in line,\" he said.\n\nThe WA government is looking to reform the state holidays to align with other states. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nIt's a common issue in Western Australia, where the state government is reviewing its public holiday schedule to align holidays like the King's Birthday, Labour Day and WA Day with other states.\n\nIf changes are made, regional local governments will still be allowed to celebrate the King's Birthday on an alternative date.",

        "text": "Energy companies are being urged to step up their planning as Canberra faces a winter with record outages amid skyrocketing demand.\n\nThe ACT government's push to phase out gas appliances and increase electrification has seen demand for electricity rise to record levels, sometimes outstripping supply.\n\nThe result has been intermittent blackouts, sometimes coinciding with freezing temperatures.\n\nBut for some, the problem is far more serious than cold feet, with businesses dependent on electricity facing large financial losses from blackouts.\n\nFor cafe owner and cheesemonger Alex Royds, a loss of power can be a costly disaster.\n\nAlex Royds says power outages can have a big impact on his small business. (ABC News: Emily Anderson)\n\nMr Royds said his day-to-day stock was about $20,000, so any power outage could cause a significant loss, especially since everything had to be kept below 4 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"It's a big loss, especially if you're just a new business \u2026 to lose a full week's worth of stock is pretty scary and might be hard to come back from,\" Mr Royds said.\n\n\"It's really sad to throw out that much food.\n\n\" When you're filling up a skip bin that could be consumed, it's just quite sad. \"\n\nOutages up 20 per cent\n\nFor power supplier Evoenergy, it has been somewhat of a nightmare winter.\n\nThere's been a jump in demand for electricity due to a colder winter and increased electrification. (ABC News: Stuart Carnegie)\n\nThe company said the outages for June this year increased by 20 per cent on outages for the same period last year.\n\nIt was attributed to a growth in power demand caused by a colder winter, a growing population, and increased electrification.\n\nThe worst-affected areas have been the Molonglo Valley and Gungahlin, two of the fastest-growing areas.\n\nOne of the community scale batteries in Denman Prospect, which stores energy from the grid. (ABC News: Stuart Carnegie)\n\nIn May, the company began trialling six new community-scale batteries in Denman Prospect to help improve electricity reliability during Canberra's high-demand winter season.\n\nIn a statement, Evoenergy said the batteries were designed to \"store energy from the grid during off-peak periods \u2014 like overnight or midday \u2014 and release it when demand is highest, especially in the evenings when heating use peaks\".\n\nTim Juhasz says other stressors on the electricity network include weather and falling trees. (ABC News)\n\nEvoenergy acting general manager Tim Juhasz said the problems in the system usually emerged during peak times when people got up in the morning and when they got home in the evening.\n\n\"The more load you have going through your network and when it starts to get close to the network's capacity and if there are any underlying issues with the network, they start to show up and might trip the feeder and cause outages for the community,\" he said.\n\nBetter planning needed, expert says\n\nMr Juhasz said there were other stressors on the system, too, from bad weather, falling trees, and other disasters.\n\nTony Wood, an energy and climate change senior fellow at the Grattan Institute, agreed unpredictable weather, particularly caused by climate change, was a problem.\n\nTony Wood says people now depend more heavily on electricity systems than they did a decade ago. (ABC News: Tara Whitchurch)\n\nBut he said he would have expected better planning from energy companies that needed to be on top of the demand from a growing population.\n\n\"We depend upon the electricity system much more than we did 10 to 15 years ago,\" Mr Wood said.\n\n\"It does mean we put much greater value on the reliability of our electricity system than we ever have before.\n\n\"As some of our cities and regional areas are growing, we need to deal with that by putting in more infrastructure.\n\n\"That's the role of the energy companies.\"\n\nEvoenergy said that in addition to the trial batteries, before next winter, it also expected to have completed the construction of the Molonglo Zone Substation, which would power thousands of homes.\n\nMr Royds says his day-to-day stock is about $20,000, so any power outage can cause a significant loss. (ABC News: Emily Anderson)\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Royds is still pleased he has gone all electric with the help of a government grant.\n\n\"It's actually made things a hell of a lot easier,\" he said.\n\nThat is while the fridges stay on.",

We actually just watched the video, and it hit my ball, and it went in. So I'm kind of claiming it, even though Mimi is probably not going to say that.\n\n\"I had no clue she'd hit my ball.

        "text": "Australian swimmer Meg Harris has won the gold medal in the women's 50m freestyle final at the world swimming championships in Singapore.\n\nOn the final night of competition, Australia's Jenna Forrester and women's medley relay team also claimed silver.\n\nHarris beat Chinese swimmers Quinfeng Wu and Yujie Cheng in 24.02 seconds, marginally slower than the swim that won her the silver medal at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\n\"Stoked, like there's not much more I can say,\" she said after the race.\n\nMeg Harris celebrates after winning gold in the women's 50m freestyle final. (Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\n\"I did the dream that I've been dreaming this whole time, like this is why I swim \u2014 also for the enjoyment \u2014 but it is nice winning.\n\n\"I still can't even put it into words \u2026 it'll take a while to process.\"\n\nHarris, who also won a gold medal in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on night one of the championships, said she had to reset her outlook after her Paris success.\n\n\"It was a bit of a tough one,\" she said.\n\n\"I felt such a high coming off that and then starting this year had to find a new motivation, not just coming in and doing the exact the same thing.\n\n\"I tried for the first couple of months, but something just wasn't working, and I needed to find a new way to do it.\n\n\"So, I stripped everything back and started with the basics \u2014 all the reasons that I started swimming, like I love sprinting, and I love racing.\"\n\nHarris admitted after the race that she swims with her eyes closed.\n\n\"I guess it's just like trying to focus on my stroke,\" she said.\n\nShe also took a breath \u2014 against instructions.\n\n\"Pretty much my whole training has been to focus on not taking a breath, but it didn't feel so great in the semis, so I just tried to do whatever came naturally and the breath came naturally,\" she said.\n\nJenna Forrester finished an equal second behind Summer McIntosh in the women's 400m individual medley final. (Getty Images: Albert ten Hove)\n\nCanada's Summer McIntosh bounced back from her disappointment with her bronze in the 800m from Saturday night to blitz the field in the 400m individual medley.\n\nHer time of 4:25.78 was two seconds slower than her own world record but was a championship record.\n\nAustralian Forrester came from third with her last stroke to tie for second with Japan's Mio Narita, 7.48 seconds behind McIntosh.\n\n\"Yeah I didn't know that I was going to come in second, I thought, maybe third,\" Forrester said.\n\n\"But seeing second up on the scoreboard I was honestly in disbelief. That was crazy.\n\n\"To make a comeback like that this year, I'm super proud of myself. Super grateful to have the support team around me: My coach, my family, my friends.\n\n\"It really means the world to me, and I felt like that swim was for everyone who helped me get here.\"\n\nMollie O'Callaghan had one last chance to move ahead of Ian Thorpe as Australia's greatest world championship swimmer in the final of the 4x100 medley relay.\n\nBut it was the United States that stole the show, breaking their own world record with a time of 3:49.34.\n\nThe quartet of Regan Smith, Kate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske will share a $US30,000 prize for breaking the record.\n\nThe United States relay team proved to be too strong for Australia in the 4x100m final. (Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\nThe Australian team of Kaylee McKeown, Ella Ramsay, Alexandria Perkins and O'Callaghan came second 3.33 seconds behind the Americans.\n\n\"I'm really proud of us all, I think we've all had a big meet,\" Perkins said.\n\n\"Just to come out here and do our best is really important and I think we did a great job.\n\n\"Also, a special mention to our little 16-year-old Sienna. She did a great job this morning too.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThat medley relay was the last event of the championships, which saw the United States top the medal table with nine gold, 11 silver and nine bronze ahead of Australia in second with eight gold, six silver and six bronze.\n\n\"One medal short,\" Australian head coach Rohan Taylor lamented.\n\n\"Obviously you hope for it all the time but it's nice for it to come down to the last relay and we did our best.\n\n\"But anyway, they were too good on the day, but that just makes us more hungry for it.\"\n\nHe said there was still room for improvement, given the absence of Ariarne Titmus, who was taking a year off, and decisions by some athletes not to swim in certain races.\n\nIllness also swept through the team and prevented Sam Short swimming in his favourite 800m.\n\n\"We've now got past this meet and me in my mindset is looking forward to the future and the next stop is Comm Games and Pan Pacs,\" Taylor said.\n\nSam Short was unable to swim in his pet event, the 800m freestyle, after suffering from an illness. (Supplied: Delly Carr/Swimming Australia)\n\n\"We had a great conversion rate \u2026 as of tonight I think our whole team had a 60 per cent of finals swims that were equal or better than trials, which is something we really strive for.\"\n\nAsked for his highlights of the meet, Taylor said they all had a little meaning.\n\nHe commended Forrester, who had to wait until the last day of the meet to swim.\n\nHe also highlighted the two 100m freestyle relay gold medals on night one and Lani Pallister's silver medal.\n\n\"Geez, that 800 free was special last night, it was just epic, I was fanning the whole time,\" he said.\n\nAsked if Ariarne Titmus planned to come back to the sport after her year off, Taylor said he hoped so\n\n\"I haven't had a chat with her, I leave Arnie alone and let her work through that, but if Arnie wants to talk to me she'll obviously ring me,\" he said.\n\n\"But I leave her to make her own decision, but I hope so, I really do. It'd be great.\"",

        "text": "What we say: In what has largely been a humdrum race for the finals, the Magpies\u2019 woes have piqued interest. They appeared a lock for a top-two finish, if not top spot, a month ago. At that point they were 10 premiership points clear at the top. But three defeats from their past four games have sparked concerns about Collingwood wobbling. Smashed in clearances at key stages in a worrying loss to the Lions, and missing Jeremy Howe, the Magpies had their worst performance since opening round. They now have an intimidating fortnight ahead and could slip to fifth. Best case: First. Worst case: Fifth. Major impact: Jeremy Cameron (left) and Lachie Neale have keys roles to play for the Cats and Lions, respectively. Credit: The Age Brisbane Lions\n\nWhat we say: Coach Chris Fagan said he expected his team to rebound after a heavy loss to Gold Coast, and they did just that at the MCG on Saturday night. The Lions should beat Sydney on Saturday and could slip into the top two, but their top-four fate will be decided over the final fortnight of the season with games against fellow premiership contenders. Best case: First. Worst case: Sixth. Geelong What we say: The Magpies\u2019 woes have the Cats ready to pounce on a top-two finish. And their run home could hardly be any friendlier, with all three of their next opponents thinking about next season. Geelong should make this a trifecta of victories, and their top-two hopes will be shaped by the fortunes of the Magpies, Lions and Crows. Secure in the knowledge of at least a top-four finish, they have the luxury of managing their best players, ensuring a healthy list for September. Best case: First. Worst case: Fifth. That\u2019s where September is: Geelong coach Chris Scott with his star onballer Bailey Smith. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nFremantle What we say: The Dockers had to rebound from four goals down at half-time against Carlton to prevail on Sunday, but that\u2019s the type of response they would not have had this time last year. On a four-game tear, they, too, have the double chance within their grasp. We\u2019ll back them in against the Power, but it\u2019s the final fortnight of the season that will tell the tale. Best case: First. Worst case: Ninth. Gold Coast\n\nWhat we say: A top-four finish, possibly even third, is not out of the question for the Suns, who now appear a lock to make their September debut. We have them winning three, if not all, of their remaining four games. If it\u2019s all four, 17 wins could be enough for the double chance. It will be great to see a fresh face in September action. Best case: Third. Worst case: Eighth. Look at that: Damien Hardwick has the Suns eyeing their maiden finals campaign. Credit: Getty Images Hawthorn What we say: It didn\u2019t feel right a fortnight ago that our ladder predictor had the Hawks missing September, but that\u2019s now a distinct possibility, their hopes also hurt by a season-ending injury to Will Day. A strong start against the Crows was wasted, and now comes a must-win clash against Collingwood on Thursday night. Lose, and the round-24 trip to Brisbane \u2013 and percentage \u2013 may decide all. Best case: Fourth. Worst case: Ninth.\n\nHawthorn\u2019s Nick Watson is with a four-legged friend here, but it\u2019s the Western Bulldogs who could usurp the Hawks in the top eight. Credit: The Age GWS What we say: The Giants are suddenly a worry. That was a shocker against the Bulldogs, even if Toby Greene, Jack Buckley and Josh Kelly were absent. While it\u2019s hard to have too much of a crack, for the Giants had won their previous six games, they could yet miss the top eight \u2013 on percentage \u2013 even if they win two of their last three games. An upset win over Gold Coast in round 23 would solve their problems. Best case: Fourth. Worst case: Ninth. Western Bulldogs\n\nWhat we say: The Dogs claimed just their second top-eight scalp of the season on Thursday, thumping the Giants in a pivotal clash. Their avenue to September now opens up, for the Demons and Eagles should be easy kills. Then comes a juicy final-round clash with the Dockers, which could determine \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 whether they even slip into the top four. The Dogs are all-in on attack and, in Aaron Naughton and Sam Darcy, have arguably the in-form, one-two key forward punch in the league. If they continue to fire, watch out. Best case: Third. Worst case: Ninth. Predicted ladder When we completed our first ladder prediction after round 19, we had Hawthorn missing the finals by a game. That was largely based on tipping the Magpies over the Hawks this Thursday, but we have now \u2013 albeit cautiously \u2013 switched that tip. In another change, we now have Fremantle edging Port Adelaide this weekend. The Suns\u2019 good form, in particular their win over Brisbane, means they could now finish with eight more premiership points than expected \u2013 and the double chance. Here is the original prediction.",

McEntarfer may not be the only head of a data collection agency in the firing line. Shoppers in SoHo, New York, last week. The US economy is doing well despite higher interest rates. Credit: Bloomberg Trump\u2019s feud with the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell and his frustration at his inability to sack him and replace him with someone who will lower US interest rates is a long-running saga. When Powell\u2019s term as chair expires next May he will be replaced by someone more amenable to Trump\u2019s desires, risking the politicisation of the central bank\u2019s decisions. Last week\u2019s inflation data, also produced by the BLS, showed goods inflation is rising. Is that, too, now discredited?\n\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics head Erika McEntarfer lost her job after her department produced numbers the president didn\u2019t like. Credit: US Bureau of Labor Statistics The US Bureau of Economic Analysis produced the data that last week showed the US economy grew at a meagre 1.25 per cent in the first half of this year, down from the 2.3 per cent growth generated in the same half of last year. Is the leadership of that agency now under threat? There\u2019s a quote in George Orwell\u2019s 1984 that seems appropriate. \u201cThe Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\u201d Despite what Trump and the propagandists in the administration might claim, Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies and his DOGE-led assault on the federal bureaucracy aren\u2019t producing an economic boom. The evidence increasingly says otherwise.\n\nHis policies are doing exactly what most neutral observers said they would, even if their impacts are only just starting to emerge because of the messy way they have been implemented. The delayed April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, or at least some of them, have been introduced in phases, the most impactful of them only last week. They will progressively show up more clearly in the data \u2013 if they are allowed to. Even their initial announcement appears to have frozen business hirings and investment, as you\u2019d expect when businesses have no idea what their cost of goods will be as the tariffs flow through to domestic suppliers. Tariffs raise prices and reduce supply and sales \u2013 that\u2019s what they are designed to do. The BLS data showed job losses were concentrated in the areas most exposed to Trump\u2019s trade policies, his job shedding in federal bureaucracies and his immigration policies, offset by additions of roles in the education and healthcare sectors that are less affected by changes in economic conditions.\n\nMore jobs will be lost in October, when the tens of thousands of government employees who took up DOGE\u2019s offer of \u201cvoluntary\u201d buyouts enter the statistics. The numbers are likely to get worse as the impact of the policies shows up more clearly. The Yale Budget Lab pits the effective average rate of Trump\u2019s tariffs, so far at 18.4 per cent, compared with about 2.5 per cent before Trump regained office. That\u2019s the highest rate since 1933 and will, Yale\u2019s economists say, push up US prices by 1.8 per cent initially, lower US GDP growth by half a percentage point and increase the unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage points this year and 0.7 percentage points by the end of next year. None of that is surprising. The tariffs are already raising substantial amounts of revenue \u2013 revenue from customs duties jumped from about $US78 billion in July last year to $US152 billion last month \u2013 and there are estimates that tariff-related revenues will, if the tariffs remain in place, generate more than $US2 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThat revenue is a new tax on US consumption, paid for by either the US importer, their corporate customers or consumers, most likely a mix of all of them. It\u2019s been described as the biggest tax hike in US history, so of course it will have an impact on economic growth and employment. Loading Already, some of America\u2019s largest companies \u2013 its auto companies and consumer products companies \u2013 are saying they are experiencing multibillion-dollar cost increases from the tariffs, and planning billion dollar cost cuts in response. Those cuts will inevitably involve jobs. Manufacturing is supposed to benefit from Trump\u2019s tariffs, indeed he has said the tariffs are designed to make the American manufacturing sector great again. The latest purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2013 also released last week \u2013 shows US manufacturing activity contracted in July. Perversely, the gloom just starting to cloud the US economy, an economy that had the strongest growth of any developed economy before Trump took office, might convince the Fed to do what Trump has demanded for months that it should do and lower its policy rate next month.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate. It is charged with maximising employment while maintaining price stability. The jobs data signals that labour market is deteriorating rapidly and is likely to shrink further. The numbers are likely to get worse as the impact of the policies shows up more clearly. The tariffs, however, are pushing up an inflation rate that, even before they were in place, was already materially above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 per cent. Its preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures index, has been creeping up and, according to data released last week, was running at 2.8 per cent in June. The Fed knows that number will continue to rise, and may or may not be transitory, which will create a dilemma. It may have to decide which element of its mandate it should prioritise.",

They\u2019ve already moved to Queensland but couldn\u2019t believe it. I still don\u2019t think they\u2019ve realised what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were happy at $1.05 million. The reserve was originally $1.025 million, and they hesitated when we wanted to raise it. \u201cBut if you\u2019d asked me if it would sell for $1.4 million, I wouldn\u2019t have bet on it either.\n\n\u201cThis tells me the market is strong, there\u2019s not enough quality stock, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency out there.\u201d The house was among 704 scheduled auctions across Sydney last week. By Saturday evening, Domain recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 73.4 per cent from 455 reported results, with 59 auctions withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold when calculating clearance rates. In Northbridge, a local dad forked out $3.62 million for a \u201cknockdown-rebuild\u201d brick home for his daughter, outmuscling developers and paying more than $600,000 above the reserve. Built almost a century ago, the original home at 255 Sailors Bay Road had remained in the same family while occupying a flat 461.6 square metre block.\n\nThe three-bedroom, two-bathroom home had a price guide of $2.7 million to $2.8 million and a reserve of $3 million. In near-original condition, it had a solid double-brick construction, rear lane access, and no heritage or conservation restrictions. There is no legal requirement for a vendor\u2019s reserve to be in line with their property\u2019s price guide. Loading Bidding opened at $2.5 million, with 10 of the 27 registered parties raising their paddles. Increments of $50,000 and $25,000 pushed the price to $3 million, followed by $10,000 and $20,000 bids to $3.3 million. The final stretch \u2013 between four bidders \u2013 played out in $5000 rises. Auctioneer Michael Garofolo,of Cooley Auctions said at least 100 people turned out, undeterred by heavy rain and howling wind. \u201cThe house was in a fantastic location and it was essentially a knockdown rebuild \u2013 and that\u2019s what attracted such a strong result,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t heritage listed, had no issues from council, and has rear lane access while being close to the shopping village and CBD.\u201d Loading Co-selling agent Irving Gunawan of Irving G Property said the home attracted developers, renovators, local families and investors. \u201cBut in the end, it was the Northbridge family who purchased it for their daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a fantastic auction \u2026 there was a sale a few doors down at 239 Sailors Bay which sold for $3.3 million in November last year. That property was a four-bedroom home and was updated, whereas ours was in original condition and two bedrooms plus a study or optional third bedroom.\u201d\n\nIn Padstow, a builder paid $2.21 million for a dated cottage he plans to transform into luxury duplexes \u2013 above the reserve by $360,000. The four-bedroom home, at 7 Barkl Avenue, sits on a 702 square metre block with a 15.24 metre frontage. It was initially guided at $1.7 million and had a reserve of $1.85 million. The property attracted strong interest from builders, developers and investors, with 17 parties registering and eight raising their paddles. Bidding opened at $1.6 million and leapt straight to $1.75 million, followed by two more $100,000 rises. At the $2.1 million mark, two remained \u2013 the builder and an investor \u2013 who traded $25,000 and $50,000 increments.\n\n\u201cThey both really wanted it and they both loved the position and location,\u201d said selling agent Abir Eddine of Ray White Revesby. \u201cThe buyer now plans to lease it out for the next two to three years before building the duplexes.\u201d Eddine expected strong interest given the home\u2019s size and potential, but said the final price exceeded expectations. \u201cWe hoped the competition would drive the auction to $2 million \u2026 but it seems the mix of everything, including the expected interest rate drops, is making people want to secure something soon,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vendors have had this one for about 25 years, and they were shocked when it hit $1.9 million.\u201d",

        "text": "In a 2013 case involving a wealthy couple and millions of frequent flyer points, a husband was ordered to transfer 1 million points to his wife. Family law expert Jodylee Bartal, a partner at Schetzer Papaleo Family Lawyers, said it was important to note that, \u201cunlike other assets, points don\u2019t gain value over time \u2013 they are vulnerable to devaluation, expiry, and policy changes\u201d. \u201cThe value of accumulated points can depend on how and when they are used. Strategic redemption, such as during a \u2018points promotion\u2019, can \u2018buy\u2019 more. Put another way, points rarely have a set dollar-per-point conversion,\u201d Bartal said. Cryptocurrency Sergi said cryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) were growing in popularity among \u201ca younger cohort\u201d, and this was the biggest growth area in digital assets in family law matters.\n\nBut she said that \u201cactually finding [those assets]\u201d was often a major issue. It was common in family law disputes \u201cfor people to try and \u2026 hide assets that are not obvious\u201d, she said, despite their legal obligation to provide full and frank disclosure of their financial circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s often a bit of a forensic exercise in making sure we\u2019ve captured everything,\u201d Sergi said. A person might withdraw cash and deposit it at a crypto ATM, for example, but it might be difficult for a lawyer acting for the person\u2019s former partner to obtain records showing that transaction. \u2018It can sometimes be an easy way [for a person] to potentially hide money.\u2019 Family law specialist Josephine Sergi \u201cThere\u2019s no central register, so finding those assets when they are not disclosed can be really hard,\u201d she said.\n\nSergi had acted for the wife in a matter in which her client had only become aware her husband had cryptocurrency because she \u201cspotted him at one of those ATMs ... in Melbourne\u201d. \u201cWe would never have known from looking at his bank statements, which only included cash withdrawals. It can sometimes be an easy way [for a person] to potentially hide money if you\u2019re not asking the right questions or taking a forensic approach to documents which are disclosed,\u201d she said. Loading In one Federal Circuit and Family Court case in 2023, a wife alleged her husband had invested some $35,000 in cryptocurrency. He said he had invested, and lost, $13,000. There was insufficient evidence before the court to make a finding. \u201cOn the basis of this conflicted evidence, I will not include any sum referable to cryptocurrency in the parties\u2019 pool of assets,\u201d Judge Stewart Brown said in his decision.\n\nJodylee Bartal said family lawyers \u201cneed to constantly upskill to keep up with changes to the definition and treatment of \u2018property\u2019,\u201d which now included digital assets. \u201cThe Family Law Act ... allows for the division of \u2018property\u2019 between separated couples. [It] does not specifically mention digital assets including ... cryptocurrency, but it is generally treated as a form of property,\u201d she said. \u2018PROPERTY\u2019 IN FAMILY FEUDS The Family Law Act allows for the division of \u2018property\u2019 between separating couples.\n\nUnder changes to the law this year, companion animals are now a separate category of property.\n\nDigital assets including rewards points and cryptocurrency are also treated as property. \u201cUnlike traditional bank accounts, which can be readily traced to the owner, cryptocurrency ownership is anonymised,\u201d she said. Forensic accountants could \u201chelp trace transactions and uncover hidden digital assets\u201d. Bartal pointed to a range of \u201cpractical challenges\u201d relating to digital assets, such as market volatility.",

        "text": "Australia's Sarah Gigante was forced to settle for sixth place in the women's Tour de France as Pauline Ferrand-Pr\u00e9vot claimed victory for the hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting the day second in the general classification, Gigante (AG Insurance - Soudal Team) lost ground on the Joux-Plane descent and finally finished the stage seventh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was two hours of pain, heartbreak and hope all in one,\" she said at the finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrand-Pr\u00e9vot's victory was never in doubt, and she launched an attack to clinch the final stage and increase her overnight lead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 33-year-old had put herself largely in control by winning Saturday's eighth and penultimate stage with an audacious solo breakaway on the last climb. That gave her an overnight lead of 2:37 seconds over Gigante and 3:18 over Demi Vollering.\n\n\n\nSunday's ninth stage from Praz-sur-Arly to Chatel was a 124km trek featuring three big mountain climbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ferrand-Pr\u00e9vot did not face any big attacks and instead launched one of her own with 6km left.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crowds cheered her all the way to the finish line and, moments later, the tears flowed as she lay on her back, exhausted but elated.\n\n\n\n\n\nVollering was 20 seconds behind in second place and Kasia Niewiadoma followed in third place as they sprinted to the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Ferrand-Pr\u00e9vot was with Gigante, 24, and a few others when they tackled the mammoth climb up Col de Joux Plane \u2014 an 11.6km grind with a gradient of 8.5 per cent.\n\n\n\nGigante is known to have trouble descending at speed and was dropped on the long downhill. She could not make up the time, especially with no teammates to help her, and lost her podium spot, finishing sixth overall, 6 minutes and 40 seconds behind the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a super hard day, I was already feeling not so strong physically going up the Joux Plane,\" she said at the finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was hoping to get away and have a head start before the downhill, but I was pretty much getting dropped by the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And then of course the descent was just so hard. It was a long day out.\"\n\n\n\nThe other Australians to complete the Tour de France Femmes were Neve Bradbury (71st), Lauretta Hanson (75th), Ruby Roseman-Gannon (78th) and Emily Watts (114th).\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving won Olympic gold in mountain biking and conquered the cobblestones of the Paris-Roubaix classic, Ferrand-Pr\u00e9vot added another line to her glittering CV with a Tour victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place to watch the 2025 Tour de France \u2014 live, free and exclusive \u2014 plus the fourth edition of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift is right here on the SBS On Demand Hub .\n\n\n\n",

Vollering was fourth.\n\n\n\nThe 24-year-old Melburnian had joked on Saturday night, at the end of the seventh stage, that some of the big names had \"missed a couple of opportunities\" to shake her off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could have got rid of me yesterday, maybe Kim today. We'll see what happens, but from our point of view, hopefully they live to regret it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday's ninth and final stage from Praz-sur-Arly to Chatel is another mountainous route, with three big climbs, and is even longer at 124 kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

So when you go swimming in the tourist attraction places, there will be a little QR code that you can scan. And when you scan it it shows you the history of Mangarrayi country and all about Mataranka photos and fishing places and shops and yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe talks about her app design - from planning to detailing it out on the computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as Monash Health, Victoria\u2019s largest health service and Indigenous-owned and managed non-for-profit organisation, Deadly Coders are helping introduce First Nations students to career pathways in Science, Technology, Engineering or Maths.\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Carter is the Chief Aboriginal Health Adviser at Monash Health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is really to expose Aboriginal and Torres Strait kids in school to STEM science, technology, engineering, math career pathways, and as a large health service that does have many STEM careers across engineering and other areas, we thought this was a really good fit for expanding on our Aboriginal workforce, that we have real targets in place to really try and recruit and engage with more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash Health also has a well-established program for the recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses, midwives, and allied health workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Carter told SBS News how they have created an opportunity to help build the future workforce and broaden the roles filled by Indigenous Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have an Aboriginal employment plan at Monash Health that looks at the recruitment and retention of Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander staff and career development as well. And so we do a pretty good job at the traditional career areas of medicine, doctors, nurses, and allied health. And we thought how do we expand upon that to engage in some of those careers in the STEM place across the spectrum of careers and health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were approached by Deadly Coders to run a small mini hackathon event to engage local school kids in the area, as they invest resources into digital health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Digital Health is really the information and communication structure systems that sit behind our health services that really support us to deliver or tackle health problems and then support us to deliver health solutions in, I guess, delivery of healthcare to improve health outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly Coders ran the App Prototyping Program at Melbourne's Moorabbin Hospital, with a focus on digital health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare defines digital health as systems, tools and services based on information and communications technology that can be used to treat patients and collect and share a patient\u2019s health information.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Brodie is the Co-Founder and General Manager Deadly Coders, that more broadly delivers STEM education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That might be a face-to-face STEM program at a school for children in Year Two. And in that case, the programs would be designed to be gamified, hands on story based, pedagogically aligned to how indigenous kids learn best and they're really designed to get kids interested in something and bring down barriers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says they move from there into more formal programs with high school students where they may be teaching text-based coding languages, problem solving with technology, building robots, or learning how to build a website.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indigenous-run not-for-profit's aim is to build interest, excitement and curiosity in STEM through hands-on activities and gamified learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also have an online learning platform, so that online learning platform has valuable content on there. Things like digital literacy, financial literacy, coding tutorials. That particular platform is I think the only platform. It's kind designed by indigenous educators and tech experts and specifically for indigenous students.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe adds that if students can learn to link fundamental skills in A-I [[artificial intelligence]] with something in the real world, that's what they want to achieve by building that engagement amongst students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also run the Deadly Coders Academy - a job skilling program designed to create alternative pathways into the tech sector through upskilling rather than formal qualifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The students essentially will have some time learning about a design thinking framework. So essentially at big businesses, how to tech groups within those big businesses work together to solve problems. Once the students have a bit of a grounding in that design thinking framework, they will then get access to and a bit of a 101 crash course in how to use an app prototyping software.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says at the end of the three days, the students in their group will get an opportunity to pitch what they've built back to Monash Health and he hopes a panel of people there will be able to decide which app solves the problem the best.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkeima is a 14-year-old from the Katherine community.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the three-days, she created a Mindset app for people struggling in school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the second day we wrote it down and we started planning it. And at the end of the day we brought out our computers and started making our account to put it in, and the third day we just finishing up our apps with classical coding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it was inspiring to hear from the speakers from Monash Health at the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was kind of inspiring cause it made me thought probably in my course I would have helped out with hospitals or something like that. It was really good of hearing of how they were going with their life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Carter says the students enjoy tackling digital solutions in a health setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The kids have just really just enjoyed engaging with a bit of a fun program to tackle digital solutions to digital problems in a health setting. So this has more been about engaging the students at a high school level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly Coders have been around since mid 2023. Andrew Brodie says they are growing quickly and have space for up to 30 students in their program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We always have some students that just take to technology like a duck to water, and it's really nice watching young people who just, something clicks for them and they get it and they get really interested in it, especially when there are kids who may not have seen technology as a pathway that was available to them. So we do get a lot of kids who didn't realise they were interested in technology, it clicks for them and they just love the program and get really interested after that.\"\n\n\n\n",

Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nDetails are yet to be worked through but Allan signalled the changes could come into effect under Victoria's Equal Opportunity Act, as private workplaces are regulated by federal laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues such as the definition of remote work, who can do it, how it would affect part-time workers and the types of businesses to which the law would apply, will be figured out through a consultation process.\n\n\n\n'Complete overreach'\n\nPeak business bodies have criticised the plan, with Committee for Melbourne CEO Scott Veenker calling it a \"complete overreach\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's another regulatory burden or requirement that just makes the cost of doing business too hard,\" he said, adding that his group \"hadn't been consulted with prior to the announcement\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality is that we want to actually have an environment where businesses can thrive and flourish, and they don't need more regulation and more legislation to prevent them [from] doing that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVeenker said the state government's new plan will make \"members both small and large\" of the business advocacy group ask if they should \"continue trading in Victoria\".\n\n\n\n\"We know that businesses will move their staff and their resources accordingly, and we don't want Victoria to be seen as a place that's too hard to do business,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They should be arrangements that are really done in conjunction with staff and the employers, rather than the state government trying to put their nose into this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want the state government to be looking at how we should be focusing on economic growth and enabling businesses to prosper.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Committee for Melbourne, which merged with the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce in 2024, describes itself as being founded \"to champion key initiatives to stimulate the economy and civic development, which put Melbourne on a pathway to become one of the world\u2019s most liveable cities\".\n\n\n\n'A really good initiative'\n\nHowever, several people SBS News talked to on the streets of Melbourne said they supported the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne young woman said it was \"a really good initiative\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think working from home allows people to have a bit more of better work-lifestyle balance, therefore making them happy \u2014 happy to be at work when it is time to be at work, [and] happy to be at home,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAnother woman SBS News spoke to said the ability to work from home \"just makes life so much easier\". Source: SBS News A middle-aged man said he currently had an arrangement to work one day a fortnight at home and would \"certainly be keen for that to be made a legal thing to do more\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA young man who works from home said: \"going to [the] office necessarily doesn't mean full productivity, so that's something people have to consider,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral experts recently told SBS News that working from home breaks down barriers to gender equality in the workplace and is necessary for modern families, especially those who face significant commutes to work.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New research shows just how much money people working from home save SBS News 03:56 English\n\nMore than one in three Australian employees typically work from home, but that figure rises to 60 per cent among managers and those in professional services, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABS also says 43 per cent of those who work from home do overtime, compared to one quarter of those who do not.\n\n\n\nState Opposition signals possible support\n\nAllan \u2014 whose announcement coincided with the Victorian Labor Party meeting for its annual conference \u2014 has promised to introduce the law in 2026, prior to the state election.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolls indicate Labor is on track to win a fourth term but the November 2026 poll will be the first as premier for Allan, who lags Opposition leader Brad Battin as preferred state leader.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Battin indicated he might support the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We support measures that help Victorians enjoy a better work-life balance, and will review any legislation closely, to ensure it supports flexibility, productivity and personal choice,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe federal Opposition's proposal to eliminate remote work for public servants was partly blamed for its poor performance in the May federal election, even though it abandoned the policy before voting day.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the campaign, former Opposition leader Peter Dutton apologised after admitting that the proposal to end work-from-home arrangements for public servants was a \"mistake\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan was immediately framed by Labor and Greens parliamentarians as being a regressive move for women's working rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also criticised as being inspired by the policies of United States President Donald Trump. One of Trump's first policies after being elected for a second term was to order all government workers to return to the office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "What we say: In what has largely been a humdrum race for the finals, the Magpies\u2019 woes have piqued interest. They appeared a lock for a top-two finish, if not top spot, a month ago. At that point they were 10 premiership points clear at the top. But three defeats from their past four games have sparked concerns about Collingwood wobbling. Smashed in clearances at key stages in a worrying loss to the Lions, and missing Jeremy Howe, the Magpies had their worst performance since opening round. They now have an intimidating fortnight ahead and could slip to fifth. Best case: First. Worst case: Fifth. Major impact: Jeremy Cameron (left) and Lachie Neale have keys roles to play for the Cats and Lions, respectively. Credit: The Age Brisbane Lions\n\nWhat we say: Coach Chris Fagan said he expected his team to rebound after a heavy loss to Gold Coast, and they did just that at the MCG on Saturday night. The Lions should beat Sydney on Saturday and could slip into the top two, but their top-four fate will be decided over the final fortnight of the season with games against fellow premiership contenders. Best case: First. Worst case: Sixth. Geelong What we say: The Magpies\u2019 woes have the Cats ready to pounce on a top-two finish. And their run home could hardly be any friendlier, with all three of their next opponents thinking about next season. Geelong should make this a trifecta of victories, and their top-two hopes will be shaped by the fortunes of the Magpies, Lions and Crows. Secure in the knowledge of at least a top-four finish, they have the luxury of managing their best players, ensuring a healthy list for September. Best case: First. Worst case: Fifth. That\u2019s where September is: Geelong coach Chris Scott with his star onballer Bailey Smith. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nFremantle What we say: The Dockers had to rebound from four goals down at half-time against Carlton to prevail on Sunday, but that\u2019s the type of response they would not have had this time last year. On a four-game tear, they, too, have the double chance within their grasp. We\u2019ll back them in against the Power, but it\u2019s the final fortnight of the season that will tell the tale. Best case: First. Worst case: Ninth. Gold Coast\n\nWhat we say: A top-four finish, possibly even third, is not out of the question for the Suns, who now appear a lock to make their September debut. We have them winning three, if not all, of their remaining four games. If it\u2019s all four, 17 wins could be enough for the double chance. It will be great to see a fresh face in September action. Best case: Third. Worst case: Eighth. Look at that: Damien Hardwick has the Suns eyeing their maiden finals campaign. Credit: Getty Images Hawthorn What we say: It didn\u2019t feel right a fortnight ago that our ladder predictor had the Hawks missing September, but that\u2019s now a distinct possibility, their hopes also hurt by a season-ending injury to Will Day. A strong start against the Crows was wasted, and now comes a must-win clash against Collingwood on Thursday night. Lose, and the round-24 trip to Brisbane \u2013 and percentage \u2013 may decide all. Best case: Fourth. Worst case: Ninth.\n\nHawthorn\u2019s Nick Watson is with a four-legged friend here, but it\u2019s the Western Bulldogs who could usurp the Hawks in the top eight. Credit: The Age GWS What we say: The Giants are suddenly a worry. That was a shocker against the Bulldogs, even if Toby Greene, Jack Buckley and Josh Kelly were absent. While it\u2019s hard to have too much of a crack, for the Giants had won their previous six games, they could yet miss the top eight \u2013 on percentage \u2013 even if they win two of their last three games. An upset win over Gold Coast in round 23 would solve their problems. Best case: Fourth. Worst case: Ninth. Western Bulldogs\n\nWhat we say: The Dogs claimed just their second top-eight scalp of the season on Thursday, thumping the Giants in a pivotal clash. Their avenue to September now opens up, for the Demons and Eagles should be easy kills. Then comes a juicy final-round clash with the Dockers, which could determine \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 whether they even slip into the top four. The Dogs are all-in on attack and, in Aaron Naughton and Sam Darcy, have arguably the in-form, one-two key forward punch in the league. If they continue to fire, watch out. Best case: Third. Worst case: Ninth. Predicted ladder When we completed our first ladder prediction after round 19, we had Hawthorn missing the finals by a game. That was largely based on tipping the Magpies over the Hawks this Thursday, but we have now \u2013 albeit cautiously \u2013 switched that tip. In another change, we now have Fremantle edging Port Adelaide this weekend. The Suns\u2019 good form, in particular their win over Brisbane, means they could now finish with eight more premiership points than expected \u2013 and the double chance. Here is the original prediction.",

McEntarfer may not be the only head of a data collection agency in the firing line. Shoppers in SoHo, New York, last week. Data shows the US economy grew at a meagre 1.25 per cent in the first half of this year. Credit: Bloomberg Trump\u2019s feud with the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell and his frustration at his inability to sack him and replace him with someone who will lower US interest rates is a long-running saga. When Powell\u2019s term as chair expires next May he will be replaced by someone more amenable to Trump\u2019s desires, risking the politicisation of the central bank\u2019s decisions. Last week\u2019s inflation data, also produced by the BLS, showed goods inflation is rising. Is that, too, now discredited?\n\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics head Erika McEntarfer lost her job after her department produced numbers the president didn\u2019t like. Credit: US Bureau of Labor Statistics The US Bureau of Economic Analysis produced the data that last week showed the US economy grew at a meagre 1.25 per cent in the first half of this year, down from the 2.3 per cent growth generated in the same half of last year. Is the leadership of that agency now under threat? There\u2019s a quote in George Orwell\u2019s 1984 that seems appropriate. \u201cThe Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\u201d Despite what Trump and the propagandists in the administration might claim, Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies and his DOGE-led assault on the federal bureaucracy aren\u2019t producing an economic boom. The evidence increasingly says otherwise.\n\nHis policies are doing exactly what most neutral observers said they would, even if their impacts are only just starting to emerge because of the messy way they have been implemented. The delayed April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, or at least some of them, have been introduced in phases, the most impactful of them only last week. They will progressively show up more clearly in the data \u2013 if they are allowed to. Even their initial announcement appears to have frozen business hirings and investment, as you\u2019d expect when businesses have no idea what their cost of goods will be as the tariffs flow through to domestic suppliers. Tariffs raise prices and reduce supply and sales \u2013 that\u2019s what they are designed to do. The BLS data showed job losses were concentrated in the areas most exposed to Trump\u2019s trade policies, his job shedding in federal bureaucracies and his immigration policies, offset by additions of roles in the education and healthcare sectors that are less affected by changes in economic conditions.\n\nMore jobs will be lost in October, when the tens of thousands of government employees who took up DOGE\u2019s offer of \u201cvoluntary\u201d buyouts enter the statistics. The numbers are likely to get worse as the impact of the policies shows up more clearly. The Yale Budget Lab pits the effective average rate of Trump\u2019s tariffs, so far at 18.4 per cent, compared with about 2.5 per cent before Trump regained office. That\u2019s the highest rate since 1933 and will, Yale\u2019s economists say, push up US prices by 1.8 per cent initially, lower US GDP growth by half a percentage point and increase the unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage points this year and 0.7 percentage points by the end of next year. None of that is surprising. The tariffs are already raising substantial amounts of revenue \u2013 revenue from customs duties jumped from about $US78 billion in July last year to $US152 billion last month \u2013 and there are estimates that tariff-related revenues will, if the tariffs remain in place, generate more than $US2 trillion over the next decade.\n\nLoading That revenue is a new tax on US consumption, paid for by US importers, their corporate customers or consumers, or most likely a mix of all of them. It\u2019s been described as the biggest tax rise in US history, so of course it will have an impact on economic growth and employment. Already, some of America\u2019s largest companies \u2013 its car and consumer products companies \u2013 are saying they are experiencing multibillion-dollar cost increases from the tariffs, and are planning billion-dollar cost cuts in response. Those cuts will inevitably involve jobs. Manufacturing is supposed to benefit from Trump\u2019s tariffs, indeed he has said the tariffs are designed to make the American manufacturing sector great again. The latest purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2013 also released last week \u2013 shows US manufacturing activity contracted in July. Perversely, the gloom just starting to cloud the US economy, an economy that had the strongest growth of any developed economy before Trump took office, might convince the Fed to do what Trump has demanded for months that it should do and lower its policy rate next month.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate. It is charged with maximising employment while maintaining price stability. The jobs data signals that the labour market is deteriorating rapidly and is likely to shrink further. The numbers are likely to get worse as the impact of the policies shows up more clearly. The tariffs, however, are pushing up an inflation rate that, even before they were in place, was already materially above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 per cent. Its preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures index, has been creeping up and, according to data released last week, was running at 2.8 per cent in June. The Fed knows that number will continue to rise, and may or may not be transitory, which will create a dilemma. It may have to decide which element of its mandate it should prioritise.",

They\u2019ve already moved to Queensland but couldn\u2019t believe it. I still don\u2019t think they\u2019ve realised what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were happy at $1.05 million. The reserve was originally $1.025 million, and they hesitated when we wanted to raise it. \u201cBut if you\u2019d asked me if it would sell for $1.4 million, I wouldn\u2019t have bet on it either.\n\n\u201cThis tells me the market is strong, there\u2019s not enough quality stock, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency out there.\u201d The house was among 704 scheduled auctions across Sydney last week. By Saturday evening, Domain recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 73.4 per cent from 455 reported results, with 59 auctions withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold when calculating clearance rates. In Northbridge, a local dad forked out $3.62 million for a \u201cknockdown-rebuild\u201d brick home for his daughter, outmuscling developers and paying more than $600,000 above the reserve. Built almost a century ago, the original home at 255 Sailors Bay Road had remained in the same family while occupying a flat 461.6 square metre block.\n\nThe three-bedroom, two-bathroom home had a price guide of $2.7 million to $2.8 million and a reserve of $3 million. In near-original condition, it had a solid double-brick construction, rear lane access, and no heritage or conservation restrictions. There is no legal requirement for a vendor\u2019s reserve to be in line with their property\u2019s price guide. Loading Bidding opened at $2.5 million, with 10 of the 27 registered parties raising their paddles. Increments of $50,000 and $25,000 pushed the price to $3 million, followed by $10,000 and $20,000 bids to $3.3 million. The final stretch \u2013 between four bidders \u2013 played out in $5000 rises. Auctioneer Michael Garofolo,of Cooley Auctions said at least 100 people turned out, undeterred by heavy rain and howling wind. \u201cThe house was in a fantastic location and it was essentially a knockdown rebuild \u2013 and that\u2019s what attracted such a strong result,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t heritage listed, had no issues from council, and has rear lane access while being close to the shopping village and CBD.\u201d Loading Co-selling agent Irving Gunawan of Irving G Property said the home attracted developers, renovators, local families and investors. \u201cBut in the end, it was the Northbridge family who purchased it for their daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a fantastic auction \u2026 there was a sale a few doors down at 239 Sailors Bay which sold for $3.3 million in November last year. That property was a four-bedroom home and was updated, whereas ours was in original condition and two bedrooms plus a study or optional third bedroom.\u201d\n\nIn Padstow, a builder paid $2.21 million for a dated cottage he plans to transform into luxury duplexes \u2013 above the reserve by $360,000. The four-bedroom home, at 7 Barkl Avenue, sits on a 702 square metre block with a 15.24 metre frontage. It was initially guided at $1.7 million and had a reserve of $1.85 million. The property attracted strong interest from builders, developers and investors, with 17 parties registering and eight raising their paddles. Bidding opened at $1.6 million and leapt straight to $1.75 million, followed by two more $100,000 rises. At the $2.1 million mark, two remained \u2013 the builder and an investor \u2013 who traded $25,000 and $50,000 increments.\n\n\u201cThey both really wanted it and they both loved the position and location,\u201d said selling agent Abir Eddine of Ray White Revesby. \u201cThe buyer now plans to lease it out for the next two to three years before building the duplexes.\u201d Eddine expected strong interest given the home\u2019s size and potential, but said the final price exceeded expectations. \u201cWe hoped the competition would drive the auction to $2 million \u2026 but it seems the mix of everything, including the expected interest rate drops, is making people want to secure something soon,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vendors have had this one for about 25 years, and they were shocked when it hit $1.9 million.\u201d",

        "text": "In a 2013 case involving a wealthy couple and millions of frequent flyer points, a husband was ordered to transfer 1 million points to his wife. Family law expert Jodylee Bartal, a partner at Schetzer Papaleo Family Lawyers, said it was important to note that, \u201cunlike other assets, points don\u2019t gain value over time \u2013 they are vulnerable to devaluation, expiry, and policy changes\u201d. \u201cThe value of accumulated points can depend on how and when they are used. Strategic redemption, such as during a \u2018points promotion\u2019, can \u2018buy\u2019 more. Put another way, points rarely have a set dollar-per-point conversion,\u201d Bartal said. Cryptocurrency Sergi said cryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) were growing in popularity among \u201ca younger cohort\u201d, and this was the biggest growth area in digital assets in family law matters.\n\nBut she said that \u201cactually finding [those assets]\u201d was often a major issue. It was common in family law disputes \u201cfor people to try and \u2026 hide assets that are not obvious\u201d, she said, despite their legal obligation to provide full and frank disclosure of their financial circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s often a bit of a forensic exercise in making sure we\u2019ve captured everything,\u201d Sergi said. A person might withdraw cash and deposit it at a crypto ATM, for example, but it might be difficult for a lawyer acting for the person\u2019s former partner to obtain records showing that transaction. \u2018It can sometimes be an easy way [for a person] to potentially hide money.\u2019 Family law specialist Josephine Sergi \u201cThere\u2019s no central register, so finding those assets when they are not disclosed can be really hard,\u201d she said.\n\nSergi had acted for the wife in a matter in which her client had only become aware her husband had cryptocurrency because she \u201cspotted him at one of those ATMs ... in Melbourne\u201d. \u201cWe would never have known from looking at his bank statements, which only included cash withdrawals. It can sometimes be an easy way [for a person] to potentially hide money if you\u2019re not asking the right questions or taking a forensic approach to documents which are disclosed,\u201d she said. Loading In one Federal Circuit and Family Court case in 2023, a wife alleged her husband had invested some $35,000 in cryptocurrency. He said he had invested, and lost, $13,000. There was insufficient evidence before the court to make a finding. \u201cOn the basis of this conflicted evidence, I will not include any sum referable to cryptocurrency in the parties\u2019 pool of assets,\u201d Judge Stewart Brown said in his decision.\n\nJodylee Bartal said family lawyers \u201cneed to constantly upskill to keep up with changes to the definition and treatment of \u2018property\u2019,\u201d which now included digital assets. \u201cThe Family Law Act ... allows for the division of \u2018property\u2019 between separated couples. [It] does not specifically mention digital assets including ... cryptocurrency, but it is generally treated as a form of property,\u201d she said. \u2018PROPERTY\u2019 IN FAMILY FEUDS The Family Law Act allows for the division of \u2018property\u2019 between separating couples.\n\nUnder changes to the law this year, companion animals are now a separate category of property.\n\nDigital assets including rewards points and cryptocurrency are also treated as property. \u201cUnlike traditional bank accounts, which can be readily traced to the owner, cryptocurrency ownership is anonymised,\u201d she said. Forensic accountants could \u201chelp trace transactions and uncover hidden digital assets\u201d. Bartal pointed to a range of \u201cpractical challenges\u201d relating to digital assets, such as market volatility.",
