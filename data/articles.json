(ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nMs Richardson said the government had so far offered a pay rise of 8 per cent over three years and a second offer that included \"some other little things\", such as a $100 camp allowance.\n\nShe said while \"nation leading salaries\" were important to attract and retain teachers to the workforce, conditions were at the front of mind for the union's members.\n\n\"Pay is important, but what's even more important for our members is conditions that support their ability to teach and lead schools,\" Ms Richardson said.\n\n\" We know that our teachers are really worried about their conditions, we have a lot of people leaving the profession and not enough coming in. \"\n\nDecision to strike not 'taken lightly'\n\nRoughly 570,000 students are set to be impacted by next Wednesday's strike.\n\nThe QTU has asked parents to keep kids at home but also ensured students would be looked after if they must attend school.\n\nMs Richardson said calling to strike for the first time since 2009 was not a decision \"teachers take lightly\".\n\nEducation Minister John-Paul Langbroek said the department would ensure schools organised appropriate supervision for students and encouraged parents to send their kids to school next Wednesday.\n\nTeachers to strike for first time in 16 years as union seeks 'fair' pay Photo shows Primary school kids carrying backpacks on a rainy winter day.

We've made a couple of offers to the teachers' union, and they of course have been rejected,\" Mr Langbroek said.\n\n\"I know renumeration is important, but conditions as well, and that's why we are working on conciliation with the teachers' union and will continue to do so.\"\n\nJohn-Paul Langbroek says he is confident a deal will be made soon.

The Queensland government has announced the state's largest-ever investment in special schools, with Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek saying there is a \"clear demand for the schools\".\n\n\"What's changed is we have an inclusion model in Queensland which means more students with complex needs are placed in mainstream classrooms,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been talking to people that are seeing 10 or 12 students in their classes who require additional needs for the complexity that they have,\" she said.\n\n\"The maximum class size is still 28 \u2014 so we're not resourced properly.\n\nMs Richardson said the teacher shortage and occupational violence were other major issues for members.\n\n\"Just being a teacher is way more complex than it's ever been.

        "text": "In a move to ease chronic gas shortages, the Northern Territory's only energy provider has requested the ability to reverse the flow of gas through a major pipeline connecting the territory to Queensland.\n\nWorks are now complete on the Northern Gas Pipeline (NGP) to make it capable of flowing in both directions, allowing the NT government-owned Power and Water Corporation (PWC) to purchase gas from the east coast gas market.\n\nIn 2019, PWC entered a long-term deal with Italian company Eni to purchase gas from its Blacktip field in the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf.\n\nThe Blacktip gas field is located in northern Australian waters. (Supplied)\n\nThe $5.5 billion deal was expected to secure supply for the NT's mostly gas-fired electricity grid and produce a surplus of gas that PWC could sell using the NGP.\n\nBut output from the Blacktip gas field has been significantly reduced since early 2021.\n\nThe ongoing shortfall has led to the company purchasing emergency gas from costly alternative sources in an effort to meet the territory's power generation needs.\n\nThe provider has been scrambling to source emergency gas in an effort to keep up with power demands in the NT. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nA spokesperson for PWC said the company made the request to allow reversed gas flow through the NGP \"as part of a broader approach to securing adequate gas supplies in the territory\", following four years of reduced gas production at Blacktip.\n\n\"Reversal of the NGP provides a backup solution if gas supply is not available from alternative arrangements,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"If gas is required from [the] east coast, the cost will be dependent on the gas market price at that time.\"\n\nThe major infrastructure upgrade was delivered by Zinfra in eight months. (Supplied: Zinfra)\n\nA spokesperson for pipeline owner and operator Jemena said its affiliated company Zinfra completed upgrades this month to make the NGP \"bi-directional\", following the request from PWC.\n\nAccording to Jemena, the Northern Gas Pipeline is now capable of delivering about 60 terajoules of gas a day into the NT from Queensland.\n\nThe operator's spokesperson said: \"To put this in context, this is around the same amount of gas used in the Northern Territory on a typical day for energy generation, as well as for household and industrial applications.\"\n\nJemena owns and operates the Northern Gas Pipeline and said around 60 terajoules of gas can be sent to the NT from Queensland each day. (ABC News: Katrina Beavan)\n\nAccording to its annual report, PWC contributed $18.9 million to the NGP reversal project during the 2023-24 financial year, but a spokesperson for the provider said \"total project costs have not yet been finalised\".\n\nAustralian Energy Market Operator data shows that the NGP remained unused on 282 days over the last 12 months.\n\nGas stops flowing to east coast as $800m pipeline sits idle Photo shows huge pipelines stockpiled on top of each other Gas has stopped flowing through the only pipeline from the Northern Territory to the east coast, highlighting uncertainty in the region's gas supply.\n\nDuring a hearing of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's Estimates Committee in June, the chair of Power and Water Corporation Board, Peter Wilson, said the NT's ongoing gas shortage was \"without precedent in the history of the Australian energy industry\".\n\n\"Here, we have been working with a significant interruption to supply for four years,\" he said.\n\nGas shortfall linked to significant cost\n\nGas is costing PWC more than anything else.\n\nAccording to the provider's corporate documents for the 2024-25, the company is expecting to record a $95.6 million operating loss in its gas division this financial year.\n\nThe company said a significant factor in its reduced profitability in the 2024-25 financial year is \"the ongoing gas curtailment\" and the hit to gas sales caused by the supply issues.\n\nPWC's gas division is expecting to record a $95.6 million operating loss this financial year. (ABC News: Michael Donnelly)\n\nThe NT's shortfall in gas supply cost taxpayers $43.4 million in 2023-24.\n\nThe Australia Institute's principal advisor and gas analyst, Mark Ogge, said he found it \"unfathomable to understand what on earth Power and Water Corporation in the Northern Territory are doing\".\n\n\"It's hard to conclude that Power and Water Corporation are competently doing their job of providing electricity to Territorians at a reasonable cost,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead of doing what they're basically meant to do, which is provide electricity for the Northern Territory, they've got into the wholesale gas market game, and they've decided to buy an enormous amount of gas and sell some of it on.\n\n\"Then, the gas project that they bought the gas from failed, so they found themselves without enough gas, and now they're having to import it.\"\n\nMark Ogge says the project that PWC \"bought the gas from failed\", leaving the NT with less supply than it needs. (ABC News: Peter Drought)\n\nMST Financial senior energy analyst Saul Kavonic said \u2014 while it's uncommon in Australia for government entities to trade gas on the wholesale market \u2014 globally, \"it's very, very common\".\n\n\"The Northern Territory hasn't got 5 million people and very large, diverse, sophisticated economic drivers,\" he said.\n\n\" It's quite small, the government's inherently going to be quite involved. \"\n\nHe argued the Blacktip deal had brought benefits to the Northern Territory.\n\n\"All things considered, it's been good for the state,\" he said.\n\nSaul Kavonic says the Blacktip deal has brought benefits to the NT. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nA spokesperson for PWC said the company \"remains in a position where its main gas supplier, Eni Australia Limited, is unable to meet its contractual obligations in relation to gas supply\".\n\nIn a statement, they said PWC continues to pursue \"its legal rights and entitlements\" under the 25-year gas sale agreement with the Italian energy company.\n\nWhile PWC said the exact details of the litigation are confidential, the spokesperson confirmed the provider is still working \"with Eni operationally and professionally to ensure that whatever gas is available is provided from Eni Blacktip into the Northern Territory electricity generation grid\".\n\nThe ABC contacted Eni, but a spokesperson said the company couldn't comment on the matter.",

        "text": "Silly me. There are a few Patience Kershaws in this book. In 1883, Eileen Creswell comes before a royal commission into working conditions in Victorian factories. She tells them she has no power, that she is no better than a slave. Byrne writes of Creswell: \u201cTo complain or argue over rates was to run the risk of dismissal.\u201d\n\nThen 140 years later, Danielle (her last name is not given in the book) tells another story, this time to an Inquiry into Price Gouging and Unfair Pricing Practices. There was an imbalance, she argued: working people were suffering while large corporations were posting major profits. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be considering whether I pay for a family member\u2019s medication or whether we can go to the doctor.\u201d She worked full time as a nurse but was considering a second job to make ends meet.\n\nAnd British-born James Galloway, a leader of the Stonemasons\u2019 Society, fighting for the eight-hour work day, while a Melbourne developer dismissed the demands. Apparently, the timing wasn\u2019t right. Such a familiar argument. We also meet Lara Watson, a self-described \u201cmouthy barmaid\u201d, who unionised her entire workplace in six weeks.\n\nByrne also tells the story of one man who was not a unionist but had an enormous impact on all of us. I knew about the Harvester judgment, but not much about the man who handed it down. He had one of the biggest impacts on Australian working conditions \u2013 the president of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, James Bournes Higgins. He\u2019d entered law because he thought constant public speaking would help him with his stutter. His decision to rule on what was really a \u201cfair and reasonable wage\u201d had an impact on Australians for decades.\n\nByrne doesn\u2019t shy away from telling us that unions face hurdles. Membership is in decline while Australia witnesses \u201cgrowing wealth inequality, a reduction in real wages, a loosening of workplace protections, the growth of insecure work, and the rise of the gig economy\u201d, he writes. Is this a blip? Or a trajectory?",

        "text": "Ominously for copyright holders, he said that AI companies had to be able to use \u201cthat pool of knowledge\u201d without experiencing the complexity of contract negotiations. The administration\u2019s objective is to make America\u2019s AI sector and its technologies the global standards for AI, exporting the technologies to its allies. Given how world-changing and disruptive AI might be, and the pace at which AI developments are occurring, the stakes in this contest for AI leadership are extremely high. Credit: Getty \u201cWe want the entire world to be running on American artificial intelligence stack. That is our cloud, our chips, our algorithms, all of that needs to be exported and packaged to the world so that we become the ecosystem of choice globally,\u201d the White House science and technology director, Michael Kratsios, told Bloomberg. China\u2019s approach, or at least the approach it publicly stated last week at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, is very different.\n\nChina\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, said AI innovation was being hampered by bottlenecks, like access to semiconductors, that could lead to AI becoming an \u201cexclusive game for a few countries and companies.\u201d Loading \u201cCurrently, overall global AI governance is still fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas such as regulatory concepts and institutional rules. \u201cWe should strengthen coordination to form a global AI governance framework that has broad consensus, as soon as possible,\u201d he said. China has proposed creating a new international organisation to develop AI, arguing that AI has risks that require nations to collaborate.\n\nDenied access by the US to the most advanced semiconductors, China has adopted an \u201copen source\u201d approach to AI, with its leading AI companies \u2013 companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba \u2013 making their large language models available to developers within and outside China as a strategy for fast-tracking a low-cost approach to developing AI and differentiating itself from Trump\u2019s America First approach. Beijing wants China, not the US, to influence international standards for AI and its AI companies to win a bigger proportion of the global AI market. It is placing a particular emphasis on the development of AI within the \u201cGlobal South\u201d group of loosely aligned countries that it has been working to bring within its sphere of influence. Xi Jinping is taking a different approach than Trump. Credit: AP In the US, the race is on between the mega tech companies to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), or human-level artificial intelligence. In China, Xi Jinping appears more focused on AI applications, or usages with practical applications for industries. The two countries are therefore pursuing somewhat different AI goals, which might reflect the success of America\u2019s export controls in denying China access to the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment required to pursue AGI. It might also be that China doesn\u2019t believe AGI will be attainable within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nIn Europe, as you\u2019d expect, the focus has been on heavily regulating AI, prohibiting some AI practices that manipulate behaviours or are exploitative: imposing rules on the use of AI in critical infrastructure, employment and other sectors regarded as high-risk and legislating in areas like the transparency of the data used for the models, the protection of copyright and the management of risks. The competition between the US and China in particular, and the differing nature of their strategies might accelerate the development and deployment of AI, but it could also inflate the risks. In Australia, where there aren\u2019t yet any AI-specific regulations, the prevailing sentiment appears to be for \u201clight touch\u201d regulation, with safeguards. Trump has effectively abandoned the safeguards the Biden regime tried to erect around the development of AI, essentially adopting the laissez-faire approach that most of the big US technology companies (which contributed heavily to his presidential campaign) have been lobbying for. Having jettisoned Biden\u2019s guardrails, he\u2019s told the technology advisers in the administration that they have six months to come up with a new set of AI policies that support his plan to fast-track AI projects, boost US technology exports and expunge the \u201cwoke\u201d out from AI.\n\nHe has said he will use every rule at his disposal to facilitate the building of AI infrastructure like data centres and chip-manufacturing plants and the energy infrastructure they require and use the US export-Import Bank and Development Finance Corp to help spread US AI technologies to other countries. The US will do \u201cwhatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence,\u201d he said. Given that those developing AI systems have themselves warned that it poses risks, not just to individuals but humankind, Trump\u2019s deregulatory approach is itself risky. Moreover, the competition between the US and China in particular, and the differing nature of their strategies might accelerate the development and deployment of AI, but it could also inflate the risks.",

Nic Seton is the CEO of an activist group called Parents For Climate and he wants to do something about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m Sophie Bennett and in this episode of the Beta Blueprint, we'll discuss how parents can help influence change and how to navigate climate conversations with young kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n*music*\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: Thanks for joining me Nic, to start with why do you get into climate activism?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I grew up on the fringes of suburbs in Logan and Queensland and really saw a lot of expansion and just with the local community felt very concerned about new freeways and the removal of forests. And then as I grew older, I realised that this is actually a big global condition that we've kind of industrialised to the point of actually undermining our own ecosystems. And I got really engaged in climate. I signed up for everything I could find to sort of campaign and make a difference. And then seven years ago I became a dad and that's when it all got very real in a different way. I sort of stopped thinking about climate change and started feeling it, particularly during the Black Summer bushfires. My 3-year-old boy at the time suffered quite acute bronchiolitis and was hospitalised a few times with need for oxygen and he was one of thousands of kids who were struggling to breathe under 90 days of constant smoke. And we were in Sydney, we're not in the middle of the bush, but we were really feeling it hard and it felt very personal. It is hard to describe, but if you've ever had a moment where your kid is in danger and you want to do something to protect them, it's very, very motivating. And I saw Parents for Climate around that time and I thought that's absolutely the organisation I want to be a part of and to help other parents respond to that constructively and make a difference for their kids.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: Yeah, I remember that summer it was truly horrible. So, with the Parents For Climate group, can you tell me a bit more about it?\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I literally just saw a notice in a cafe, in a cafe window in the inner west of Sydney and it just said, come along, we're just having a meetup, we're doing a playgroup. Bring your kids, we've got toys. We're having a chat about climate activism. I thought, well, that's a great place to start because most parents don't really know what actions to take or don't have a lot of time, but if you can fit it in because you need a play date and frankly socialising your kids and meeting some other parents is pretty important to you, especially with young kids that just fit our schedule beautifully. And so it just so happened to be that we were coming together for that and for a positive conversation about climate action. And yeah, I really found a home there.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: When you mentioned before that you said you started really feeling climate change rather than just being aware of it \u2026 would you describe that feeling as climate anxiety or a heightened level of fear?\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely, I'm one of those people that want to know as much as possible on the issues of things like climate change. And I do as much reading as I can and reading different perspectives and I think it sort of led me to understand that we're going to struggle to deal with some of the fallout of climate impacts for the next few decades as a community, as society, and also just as individual families. And this really hit home when I was talking to Professor Mark Howden, so he's an ANU climate scientist and one of the lead authors on the Impacts report from the most recent International Panel on Climate Change and he is also a dad. And he said, yeah, look, I'd gladly talk to your community online. We ran a webinar and people just sort of said, how bad is it? It was a hard conversation. He really sort of said, this is what we know could happen. But he also said something that was very motivating, which was we could turn this around in the lifetimes of ourselves, not just our kids, but our own eyes could witness our kids' world becoming safer from a climate perspective. If we get it right, if we get on top of this, the next few decades will be hard, but there is a world we will live in if we get it right. And that's so powerful to hear because while knowing your kids have to go through so much growing up and all the change that comes with that and there's going to be hard times, you accept that and still do everything you can to set them up for success. And I think climate change is no different.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: Ok, so when it comes to practical action, what are you doing now as a parent?\n\n\n\n\n\nLook, I sometimes describe Parents for Climate as both a home for those parents who maybe are starting their journey into climate action and just need a sense of community and to be seen and heard and felt and respected and belong. But it's also a strategy. Parents for Climate plays a really big role in power and politics because 12.5 million Australians are parents. It's the majority of voters. There might be grandparents, there might be carers, there might be single parents, but we've all got this innate prioritising of our kids' best interest going on. And research in the Climate Compass, which looks at attitudinal profiles towards climate change, shows us that about a quarter of those parents are already alarmed or alert, they're engaged, they're switched on to wanting to do something about climate change, but in another quarter the bit that start to cross over into the middle of the normal curve, they're concerned but they're quite passive. They're not given the time, space, opportunity, or access to make a difference. And that's what our organisation is focused on is working with those people who are active to really connect with and support those who aren't yet active. But if asked, they have a strong opinion to express and want to see things that are in the best interest of their kids and that could be really powerful and we're already seeing it play out. The current parliament has a cross bench made up of climate champions, which wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the mums in particular in those electorates who decided to change their vote from their traditional pathway to that particular option.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: So you\u2019re talking about driving political change, but maybe not through some of the more reactionary ways you tend to see in the media, like people throwing paint on famous artworks or blocking ports and roads.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's right. I think the media's really good at showing those moments, those peaks of conflict or action that are maybe a bit more polarising. And to be honest with you, I know that very well because my background, I spent seven years working with Greenpeace in different countries. I specialised in how to engage audiences and get their attention on issues by creating big spectacles and polarisation moments. Like to give you an example, back in the early 2000's, tweens, I was figuring out how to attach iPhone cameras to the tops of climber's helmets so that a team of female climbers could scale the outside of London's tallest building and hang a banner. And we managed to get the attention according to YouGov polling of half the country in the UK during that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: It's interesting too that you've come from that background working with GreenPeace and doing those big stunts. Do you still believe that they're effective?\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, in climate campaign circles, we often refer to this as different theories of change. How does change happen? And generally speaking, we don't all agree on the theory of change, but we all agree that we need all of them because we don't know which one's going to be the most effective till we try it. And the metaphor I use is if you want to put out a fire, you're going to need a pretty big blanket and you're not going to be able to be covering every corner yourself. You're going to need a lot of people tanking on different corners. One succinct way to put it is we need to build bridges on climate. We've learned in Australia that polarisation, partisanship and extreme points of view can cost us so much time and so much energy and so much missed opportunity. We've got to build common ground. We've got to agree on there's the principles that's in everybody's best interests because this isn't an us versus them that's totally manufactured and made up, it's everybody's kids altogether. Let's get it done for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: Your children are 4 and 7, have you started discussing the climate with them? How do you plan to navigate those conversations?\n\n\n\n\n\nI think on a personal level, the conversation we have in our family about climate change, we've done a bit of reading and we've made some of these resources available on the Parents for Climate website. It's important not to go too heavy, too hard and too strong on the emotion side of this conversation. These are big conversations. Any big world issues, global conflict health and pandemics, climate change, you don't just drop it all on top of your kids with all of your feelings. You've got to listen to them first. So you've got to ask them, what do you know? What have you heard? How are you feeling about this? And get a read on where they're at so that you are not trying to shape it. Then you've got to check yourself how do you feel as a parent? And if you are not in the right emotional space to be giving them a constructive and positive direction, don't go there. Just take a break. You don't have to solve the problem with them in every moment, but of course if you are ready to listen to them and say, okay, where are you at? Got it, let's talk about this and talk about it in constructive terms because it's a problem that we are solving and it's always got to be in that frame because if we say to kids, this is a problem and there's nothing you can do about it that's so disempowering. It's not good for their self-esteem, not good for their mental health at any age, and it's also not true.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're at halfway to a 2030 target already on renewable energy. We're seeing 40% in Australia. There's terrific examples of how renewable energy or climate solutions are happening at a grand pace that is actually really exciting. And so it's really useful to point to those examples of this is how we're dealing with this problem and talk about how would you like to engage with that. They might talk about careers or ideas or they might say, let's do some art and drawing and create pictures. Sometimes when I go into classrooms, I really love pulling up a slide that comes from a Bluey episode where they picture the future. They just do a sort of brief landscape and they picture the future of what Bluey might look like when she's an adult and the kids point to the screen and they call out all the things they can see, like solar panels and the plants are on the buildings and the car is electric. It's really exciting to think about the future where we're building together, and I think that's the attitude we need to give our kids so that it builds them up, makes them feel strong and resilient and also gives them some control.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: So being in classrooms and having your kids at home, do you think this generation will be different to previous ones?\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely. I think, and the teachers do an amazing job here when kids are learning about influence and media or discourse or advertising or geography and weather cycles and rain patterns, and they're coming home with this immense interest and fascination in what they're seeing in the real world, not just at school, how the weather's behaving. And so we're talking about it all the time. I think it's something that we just need to be ready for. There will be a lot of changes in our own world. Right now for example, our organisation's looking at the fact that for the last few years we've had a pattern of the back to school week being one of the most heavily impacted in Australia by unnatural weather disasters. We are observing this stuff and our kids are too, and it's hard to know where things will happen and when, but we need to be ready to have those conversations and to equip the kids with the understanding. We also need to be ready as a community, we need to be ready to have a conversation about what types of changes might we need to make. How can we set schools up so that they have solar powered air conditioning with a battery that's resilient to power outages during heat waves because that's an issue that's affecting kids' health and their access to education or as in the case of countries like the Philippines, do we actually need to talk about, and I know this might alarm some parents who are just done with the school holidays this year, but do we need to talk about moving the academic calendar? Because if the first week back at school is too heavily exposed to risk, particularly risk to health, but also education, we might need to think about how to adjust to that even if it's uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: Yeah, that's interesting. What other changes do you think need to be happening right now?\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, look, this all kind of falls out from solving climate change for kids can be boiled down to a few basic points. We need to make sure that we stop making the problem worse. And so we're talking to parents about what kind of products are you experiencing that might be creating unnecessary pollution or not necessarily accounting for that pollution accurately. Another aspect is that we need to make sure that kids are safe at school and in any environments they go to. That means looking at what are the adjustments we need to make to keeping them safe from a lot of the impacts we can't avoid. Schools should be resilient in places of learning. We already know that childcare centres have a legal requirement to maintain safe air temperatures, for example. Schools need to be supported to do that too. Many states have already done significant air conditioning rollouts. There are still massive gaps in some states and that really needs to be backed up by clean energy and solar panels because ultimately that is just the most cost effective way of getting it done.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools are open during the day, they cool during the day and they need to use that daytime energy. It also creates a different kind of grid equation which can benefit community at large when it comes to solar supply and renewable energy and its impact on wholesale electricity prices. We also want to make sure that kids are safe at home. Unfortunately, not all homes are able to do that without support. You've got low income homes, you've got renters, you've got social housing that just don't have the agency or the autonomy to make changes to their living conditions and frankly should be supported to also have an efficient all electric and air conditionable home so that they can withstand the worst effects of heat and storms. And lastly, we just need to make sure we're getting it done in a way that's really visible to our kids. We want to make sure that we're building essentially resilient infrastructure in the form of schools and childcare centres in particular that are powered and backed by solar and batteries because we think at scale, not only could that be fantastic for the equation of each of those individual centres and sites, but at scale that would actually be a significant change, like top 10 electricity users, if you include all the energy and carbon that goes into schools and drop-offs and all of this, we could be talking about the fifth biggest energy consumer industry in Australia. It's just getting our kids educated at high school and primary school and childcare centres. If we tackle that by saying, well, why don't we just use that roof space, that huge roof space to turn that around, then we can get that done. And that's something that we've been working on. Some states have worked with us towards some progress. We've seen about 71 million across three states unlocked to fund solar and battery installations. We think it should be Australia wide. It's a bit of a no brainer, and I think a lot of the politicians we're talking to agree with us. We just need to get it up to the hierarchy of issues on their agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: It\u2019s good to hear you talk about those large scale projects. Just reflecting on my own childhood, there was a lot of talk around individual action like recycling and eating less meat and obviously while they're good things to do, just that list of things you've just said, it's clearly putting the responsibility on governments and businesses rather than only individuals. Do you think there has been a transition in the way people consider who is responsible when it comes to climate change?\n\n\n\n\n\nI think so. I think a lot of Australians are sort of coy to the notion that they are responsible for this. This is a bigger systemic issue and we see it in polling, across polling from all sides of the spectrum, hearing that Australians want more action from government, they want more action from industry and business. They get that those actors are capable of making differences that an individual simply can't by themselves. But also it's potentially really positive to think about individual action because if you show your kids in your own life that you take care, you do some active transport, go walking or bike riding rather than driving your car on the occasion just because it's good for us and it's the kind of world that we want to create, show how you're managing your own household waste, things like that. Not only does that help your kids see and feel and get involved and feel quite a degree of agency and empowerment, it also helps us all to see ourselves as agents of change and just to feel good about making that little difference that we can make. Because at the end of the day, these are big issues that are beyond the capability of an individual.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we have to think, well, what can we control and focus on that. But I highly recommend connecting with others because if we connect, we get stronger and that means we can affect the big picture and that's something that we're focused on doing. So we are trying to present big ideas to parents so that we can get them on board. But of course it starts with what can we do at home and how can we get our kids involved? And that's something to be really proud of as well. I think the number one trap that I want people to watch out for is feeling like they're not doing enough. I mean, God, it's hard enough as a parent these days to not feel guilty for spending too much time at work or not doing everything you can for your kids or all of those extra clubs you could be going to with the sports involvement or whatever, take the pressure off. You are not responsible for this issue. Do what you can. And if the best you can do right now means you have to use a product that might not be perfect, that's fine. Let's focus on working together to fix the supply chain so that you are not responsible for that decision on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\nSB: Yeah, I think that's an important message to send out. And just quickly before we wrap up, is there any other final advice you have for parents navigating climate activism and raising kids?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a lifelong conversation that we are all going to be a part of and we need to see it in that way. If you need a break, take a break, come back to it later. Don't see it as an all or nothing. Don't let yourself burn out. We've got too much pressure to let something like this take away the positive change that we can create for our kids. So I do want to remind everybody, particularly parents, that the world's not on your shoulders. Let's shoulder it all together because you're not alone and you don't have to do it all, all the time.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia bans \u2014 and they\u2019re wonderful people, and wonderful everything \u2014 but they ban American beef. Yet we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won\u2019t take any of our beef. They don\u2019t want it because they don\u2019t want it to affect their farmers and, you know what I don\u2019t blame them, but we\u2019re doing the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen United States President Donald Trump singled out Australia's ban on US beef imports, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he would never compromise on protecting farmers or biosecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have made it very clear to the United States that we will not compromise on biosecurity. We will not weaken the measures that protect our farmers and producers from the risks of disease or contamination. Indeed, we've made it a priority to strengthen biosecurity, because one of the things that makes Australian food and fibre the best in the world is a people everywhere, know that it stands for quality. It also stands for safety.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, ahead of the tariff deadline on August 1, Australia's restrictions on US beef imports have been dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government says the timing of the decision is a coincidence, and has nothing to do with Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Agriculture, Julie Collins, says a review into the US beef ban began in 2015 under the Coalition Government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This decision has been purely based on science and a rigorous assessment by my department. Biosecurity risk assessment process is very robust and I have faith in the officials in my department to do this appropriately. These are experts in the field. Australia's biosecurity system is world-renowned for a reason and this assessment has now been completed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Australia changed restrictions to allow beef imports from cattle traceably born, raised, and slaughtered in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, however, the ongoing biosecurity rules meant that only a small amount of beef, largely shelf-stable products, were imported from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are assured that the supply chain and traceability and the safety of any food coming into Australia is safe. The US, of course, has been able to bring beef into Australia since 2019. Our farmers, are of course, are exporting already to the United States. We're exporting over four billion dollars' worth of beef to the United States presently and our farmers are a net beneficiary of our two-way trading system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, why was the ban imposed in the first place?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd should Australians be concerned about eating beef imported from the US?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Australia placed restrictions on the import of US beef in response to an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, more commonly known as Mad Cow Disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nHumans cannot contract mad cow disease, though in rare cases they can develop a variant which leads to dementia and premature death.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Australian food regulator deems US beef is low-risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell says the government would not compromise standards for trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have not made any compromise and we certainly have not compromised Australia's strict biosecurity laws. This has been a process that's been underway for the last 10 years. It's now come to a completion and it's appropriate that we announce the results of that inquiry. But at no stage do we risk our terrific biosecurity standards for any trade arrangement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key concern remaining after 2019 was that Mexico's livestock tracking system could inadvertently allow beef from disease-affected regions to enter Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the government says the review has found that the US Department of Agriculture protocols for beef imported from Canada and Mexico now address Australia's biosecurity concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Thomas, the Chair of the Western Beef Association, says it's unclear how effective the US tracking system is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, we implement an NIL system, as they call it, so any animal that's born on your property has a electronic tag, and that same tag is scanned and transferred whenever that animal leaves your property, all the way through to sort of slaughter. So an animal that's been slaughtered, they can go back and work out where that animal has been over its lifetime. I am unsure how quickly America can get up to speed. However, it's taken many, many years for Australia to implement that system and make sure that it works efficiently.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite government assurances, National Party leader David Littleproud is among critics calling for an independent examination into the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government has not provided or released the protocols on which the beef from the U.S could be imported into this country. Those are the legal requirements that an importer would have to meet to bring beef from the United States into Australia, that was from Mexico or Canada. The fact they haven't done that raises serious concerns to me around how this decision has been made and the timing of it. If it was well planned, the department would be able to provide me with those details. They have not. I think the prudent way forward is to have an independent scientific panel review the department's decision and the protocols when they came out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with concerns about the spread of disease, there are also concerns about differing US regulations around the use of hormones and antibiotics on cattle.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some cattle in the US are given approved natural or synthetic hormones to help them grow, the US Food and Drug Administration regulates these, and experts say they are in extremely low levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS beef, according to both Australian and US officials, is safe to eat, but is it better than Australian beef?\n\n\n\n\n\nEvangeline Mantzioris is the Program Director of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of South Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the diet of an animal impacts the nutritional value of the meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What it comes down to is the type of feed that the animals are given. So in the US they tend to be grain-fed whilst here in Australia, they tend to be grass-fed, and that produces differences in the way that the body of the cow handles it and in the way that they make and lay down fat in their body. The other thing that might make a slight difference is also the genetics of the cows. So assuming it's the same breed of cow, we expect grain-fed to lead to more fat in the meat compared to grass-fed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies show that grass-fed beef can be 30 to 75 per cent lower in fat than grain-fed.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrass-fed is also reported to have higher levels of beneficial Omega-3 fats, up to five times more antioxidants, and slightly higher protein, with some studies also indicating lower cholesterol.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for consumers, choosing between local and imported beef will mostly come down to personal preference rather than health concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Mantzioris says while the differences aren't major, grass-fed beef is the best option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if we combine all of those different components of the beef that we've looked at, overall grass fed beef, which is what we have in Australia, is the healthier option.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about Australian farmers?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Australia lifted the ban, Donald Trump wrote on social media that the US was now going to sell 'so much beef' to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is the second largest exporter of beef products in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while Australians are some of the highest per capita consumers of beef products, our relatively small population means we have a lot left to export.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Thomas says he isn't too worried about competing with U-S products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, I suppose, from a from a cattle perspective's point of view, our only concern would be if we thought that US beef was going to compete with our own product here in Australia, and I don't believe that that is going to do so based on the price of cattle in the US over a longer period of time and considering their cattle numbers compared to what we have here in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, US cattle stocks have been in decline for two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States is the second largest importer of beef globally and cattle stocks in the country are the lowest they've been since the 1950's.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture says beef prices have increased by 8 per cent since the start of 2025, with one kilogram of beef costing around AU$30..\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Thomas says with beef shortages in the United States, it's unlikely the Australian market is going to be flooded with imported US beef.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, currently, there's a lot of Australian beef going into the US market, purely because they need it. At the moment, cattle prices in the US are just quoting a heavy steer close to $5 whereas that same animal in Australia is only going for $2.50 so how can they purchase an animal for $5 a kilo? Process it, send it to the other side of the world and expect to compete with the product that we have here?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile beef prices have been increasing in the United States, Australian beef exports broke an all-time monthly record in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the biggest buyer was, that's right, the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn New York, Stew Leonard Junior is the CEO of a grocery chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he gets grass-fed beef from Australia and plans on splitting the tariff cost with his supplier.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Silly me. There are a few Patience Kershaws in this book. In 1883, Eileen Creswell comes before a royal commission into working conditions in Victorian factories. She tells them she has no power, that she is no better than a slave. Byrne writes of Creswell: \u201cTo complain or argue over rates was to run the risk of dismissal.\u201d\n\nThen 140 years later, Danielle (her last name is not given in the book) tells another story, this time to an Inquiry into Price Gouging and Unfair Pricing Practices. There was an imbalance, she argued: working people were suffering while large corporations were posting major profits. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be considering whether I pay for a family member\u2019s medication or whether we can go to the doctor.\u201d She worked full time as a nurse but was considering a second job to make ends meet.\n\nAnd British-born James Galloway, a leader of the Stonemasons\u2019 Society, fighting for the eight-hour work day, while a Melbourne developer dismissed the demands. Apparently, the timing wasn\u2019t right. Such a familiar argument. We also meet Lara Watson, a self-described \u201cmouthy barmaid\u201d, who unionised her entire workplace in six weeks.\n\nByrne also tells the story of one man who was not a unionist but had an enormous impact on all of us. I knew about the Harvester judgment, but not much about the man who handed it down. He had one of the biggest impacts on Australian working conditions \u2013 the president of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, James Bournes Higgins. He\u2019d entered law because he thought constant public speaking would help him with his stutter. His decision to rule on what was really a \u201cfair and reasonable wage\u201d had an impact on Australians for decades.\n\nByrne doesn\u2019t shy away from telling us that unions face hurdles. Membership is in decline while Australia witnesses \u201cgrowing wealth inequality, a reduction in real wages, a loosening of workplace protections, the growth of insecure work, and the rise of the gig economy\u201d, he writes. Is this a blip? Or a trajectory?",

        "text": "Ominously for copyright holders, he said that AI companies had to be able to use \u201cthat pool of knowledge\u201d without experiencing the complexity of contract negotiations. The administration\u2019s objective is to make America\u2019s AI sector and its technologies the global standards for AI, exporting the technologies to its allies. Given how world-changing and disruptive AI might be, and the pace at which AI developments are occurring, the stakes in this contest for AI leadership are extremely high. Credit: Getty \u201cWe want the entire world to be running on American artificial intelligence stack. That is our cloud, our chips, our algorithms, all of that needs to be exported and packaged to the world so that we become the ecosystem of choice globally,\u201d the White House science and technology director, Michael Kratsios, told Bloomberg. China\u2019s approach, or at least the approach it publicly stated last week at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, is very different.\n\nChina\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, said AI innovation was being hampered by bottlenecks, like access to semiconductors, that could lead to AI becoming an \u201cexclusive game for a few countries and companies.\u201d Loading \u201cCurrently, overall global AI governance is still fragmented. Countries have great differences, particularly in terms of areas such as regulatory concepts and institutional rules. \u201cWe should strengthen coordination to form a global AI governance framework that has broad consensus, as soon as possible,\u201d he said. China has proposed creating a new international organisation to develop AI, arguing that AI has risks that require nations to collaborate.\n\nDenied access by the US to the most advanced semiconductors, China has adopted an \u201copen source\u201d approach to AI, with its leading AI companies \u2013 companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba \u2013 making their large language models available to developers within and outside China as a strategy for fast-tracking a low-cost approach to developing AI and differentiating itself from Trump\u2019s America First approach. Beijing wants China, not the US, to influence international standards for AI and its AI companies to win a bigger proportion of the global AI market. It is placing a particular emphasis on the development of AI within the \u201cGlobal South\u201d group of loosely aligned countries that it has been working to bring within its sphere of influence. Xi Jinping is taking a different approach than Trump. Credit: AP In the US, the race is on between the mega tech companies to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), or human-level artificial intelligence. In China, Xi Jinping appears more focused on AI applications, or usages with practical applications for industries. The two countries are therefore pursuing somewhat different AI goals, which might reflect the success of America\u2019s export controls in denying China access to the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment required to pursue AGI. It might also be that China doesn\u2019t believe AGI will be attainable within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nIn Europe, as you\u2019d expect, the focus has been on heavily regulating AI, prohibiting some AI practices that manipulate behaviours or are exploitative: imposing rules on the use of AI in critical infrastructure, employment and other sectors regarded as high-risk and legislating in areas like the transparency of the data used for the models, the protection of copyright and the management of risks. The competition between the US and China in particular, and the differing nature of their strategies might accelerate the development and deployment of AI, but it could also inflate the risks. In Australia, where there aren\u2019t yet any AI-specific regulations, the prevailing sentiment appears to be for \u201clight touch\u201d regulation, with safeguards. Trump has effectively abandoned the safeguards the Biden regime tried to erect around the development of AI, essentially adopting the laissez-faire approach that most of the big US technology companies (which contributed heavily to his presidential campaign) have been lobbying for. Having jettisoned Biden\u2019s guardrails, he\u2019s told the technology advisers in the administration that they have six months to come up with a new set of AI policies that support his plan to fast-track AI projects, boost US technology exports and expunge the \u201cwoke\u201d out from AI.\n\nHe has said he will use every rule at his disposal to facilitate the building of AI infrastructure like data centres and chip-manufacturing plants and the energy infrastructure they require and use the US export-Import Bank and Development Finance Corp to help spread US AI technologies to other countries. The US will do \u201cwhatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence,\u201d he said. Given that those developing AI systems have themselves warned that it poses risks, not just to individuals but humankind, Trump\u2019s deregulatory approach is itself risky. Moreover, the competition between the US and China in particular, and the differing nature of their strategies might accelerate the development and deployment of AI, but it could also inflate the risks.",
