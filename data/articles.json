(Photo by ROB HOMER SPECIAL 103506) (Rob Homer) (Nine)\n\nThe outlook is backed by the inflation dropping to the RBA's target range of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.\n\nEconomist Evan Lucas told Today this morning that it was unlikely the RBA would make a larger cut today.\n\n\"There are some that are suggesting they could do as much as half of 1 per cent. That seems unlikely, considering how robust the employment market is.\" he said.\n\nIn February, the RBA made the first official rate cut in almost five years, and a big question home owners are asking now is how many more there will be.\n\nExperts are tipping two or three further reductions this year.\n\nThe next one would probably be in August when results from the second quarter of the economic year become clear.\n\nThe RBA could possibly make a fourth reduction in Melbourne Cup week when its board meets in early November.\ufeff\n\n\"But in short, it will mean that the cash rate will be significantly lower than where it started the year and a significantly bigger boost for the household and the mortgage rates that people have,\" Lucas said.",

        "text": "A crippling drought described as the worst in decades is devastating regional Victoria and South Australia.\n\nSmall communities and agricultural producers are doing it tough and have warned of potential collapse as they plead for urgent government assistance .\n\nAnd with household budgets tight and stretched around the country, consumers are looking at the shelves wondering if they'll start seeing prices start to shoot up - or worse, empty spaces - as producers dig in for the lean times.\n\nAustralian producers are battling drought in Victoria and South Australia. (AAP)\n\nShould shoppers be worried?\n\nIndustry analyst and managing director at Food Industry Foresight\ufeff Sissel Rosengren has some reassuring news for households, although, she says, many Australian producers are still \"struggling\".\n\n\"It fluctuates, but on a national scale, Australia is very resilient to these types of supply shocks,\" she said.\n\n\"Shortages are likely to be more localised in the supply chain. Longer, centralised supermarket supply models are more flexible and will already be assessing and working rapidly to fill supply from other sources.\"\n\nSupermarkets have indicated they aren't worried about short supplies. (Getty)\n\n\ufeffSupermarkets contacted by 9news.com.au indicated they were not worried about supply and were working with producers around the country to keep shelves stocked.\n\nRosengren said the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic also stood the country in good stead\ufeff, from the importance of diversifying supply chains, to the need for food businesses to stay ahead of supply issues.\n\n\"Even with the recent avian flu, with periods of little to no egg cartons on the shelves in supermarkets \u2013 there is a lot of work put in along the supply chain to find ways to correct, which is why you can still buy eggs, even if not as abundantly,\" she said.\n\nAre any foods in particular likely to be affected?\n\n\ufeffAny shortfalls in production from commodities like beef and grain from Victoria and South Australia can likely be made up from other states which are major producers, Rosengren said.\n\n\"Victoria is a leader for lamb and mutton however, so there might be some pressure on that commodity as a result, though NSW and Western Australia also contribute significantly,\" she said.\n\n\"Another one would be wine grapes, considering South Australia is the highest producer by volume.\n\nLamb supplies out of Victoria could be affected. (Getty)\n\n\"Both South Australia and Victoria are significant horticultural producers, but it is a mix that can be supplied from elsewhere also.\"\n\nIt's also possible the market could see an \"intermittent glut\" of livestock, as producers sell off herds and flocks to save on feeding costs.\n\n\"Drought also affects producer resources, such as feed for livestock. Interstate freight is particularly expensive at the moment, which reduces the ability to supply feed from Western Australia, for example, to fill that need,\" Rosengren said.\n\nSouth Australia is a major wine producer. (Getty)\n\n\"Producers are likely sourcing closer to home, such as NSW, but that places added burden in the supply chain and can impact prices.\"\n\nShe said this could affect the local economies where producers are being hardest hit, while broader state economies would have to bear the cost of lost production.\ufeff\n\nWill things get worse if the drought continues?\n\nAccording to Rosengren, Australia imports only about 10 per cent of its food, with up to 90 per cent being grown and produced locally.\n\n\"Droughts such as these do place a constriction on supply, but due to that high domestic production, there is also room to increase the import mix to buffer the impact of the drought,\" she said.\n\n\"This is only seen when effects are long-term, such as years long.\"\n\nBut prices in the shorter term can be affected by things like export incentives, freight costs, productivity in other states, and inflation, though the latter, Rosengren said, was \"getting under control\".\n\n\"It is likely the most noticeable impact on shelf prices will come if there is a long, extended drought,\" she said.\n\n\"If you take the drought from 1996 to 2010 as an example, food prices only sharply increased from around 2005.\"\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nRosengren said Australia's history of droughts and other environmental challenges had fuelled the construction of a robust, adaptable, resilient food industry\ufeff.\n\nProducers have also been focused on resilience and mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of drought.\ufeff\n\nBut, she warned, climate change was likely to make dealing with similar situations \"the new normal\".\ufeff\n\nThese are the world's most expensive passports View Gallery\n\n\"Australian agriculture productivity has continued to improve despite challenging climate conditions, even if gains have slowed,\" she said.\n\n\"Australian producers are amazing at producing more with less, and this will continue with ongoing investment in research and development, innovation and technology.\n\n\"That also means our food systems continue to evolve to have the adaptability to respond and implement their own mitigation strategies.\ufeff\"",

You've got a bucket.\"\n\nBoth students expressed nerves for the upcoming finals but will be supported by family, friends and teachers in the audience.\n\nThe 10 girls will compete at the finals tomorrow at the Sydney Opera House.",

        "text": "In her late 30s, there was nothing Cyndi wanted more than to become a mum.\n\nSingle and worried about declining fertility, Cyndi says it was \"now or never\" and she planned to start IVF.\n\nBut she couldn't afford it.\n\n\"It wasn't something I could put off and save for,\" says the 40-year-old from Melbourne/Naarm, who asked we don't use her surname.\n\nAfter discovering she could apply to use her superannuation to pay for treatment, Cyndi did so on three occasions.\n\n\"At that point, what I really wanted in life more than anything was to have a child.\n\n\"I had this mindset, which might sound a bit morbid, but you could die at any point and not use your super.\"\n\nShe withdrew a total of $42,000 (plus tax), and after six embryo transfers, gave birth to her son.\n\nAustralians are increasingly accessing their superannuation early on compassionate grounds, mainly to fund medical procedures, including IVF.\n\nIn 2023-24, 4,210 people had applications approved for IVF treatment, compared to 2,720 in 2018-19 \u2014 an increase of 55 per cent.\n\nSo what is the process, and what are the ramifications of choosing this route?\n\nOur experts Dr Neera Bhatia, an associate professor and director of the Law, Health and Society Research Unit at Deakin University\n\nNatasha Janssens, financial educator and behavioural money coach\n\nDr Manuela Toledo, board member with the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand\n\nAn emotionally vulnerable time\n\nThe use of super to pay for IVF is something that concerns Neera Bhatia, an associate professor and director of the Law, Health and Society Research Unit at Deakin University.\n\nHer paper, Emptying the nest egg to fill the nursery: early release of superannuation to fund assisted reproductive technology, was published in 2021.\n\nNeera Bhatia says people accessing superannuation for IVF are often in a vulnerable position and don't rationally think about the implications. (Supplied)\n\nWhile Dr Bhatia is not critical of people accessing their super to fulfil their desire to become a parent, she says there is potential for exploitation.\n\nHaving been through IVF to have her own children, Dr Bhatia says \"people are really emotionally vulnerable and fragile\" at the time, and often don't think about the implications of accessing super in \"a rational sense.\"\n\nAnd not every IVF journey ends with a baby.\n\nDealing with IVF debt when you're childless Photo shows couple hugging and looking out window Any debt linked to fertility treatment can be a painful reminder for childless people that life didn't go as they planned. And it's often not just financial debt they are left with, either.\n\nThe process of accessing super early to fund IVF\n\nTo access super funds early on compassionate grounds, people apply to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).\n\nApplicants need to show the procedure is needed to alleviate pain or to treat a life-threatening injury or illness, says Dr Bhatia, or claim they are experiencing \"acute, or chronic, mental disturbance\".\n\n\"A person might be able to access super early on the basis they are claiming that infertility or the fact they are unable to have a child has caused them acute mental disturbance,\" she says.\n\n\"It doesn't actually define what a mental disturbance is; it leaves it really open and broad.\"\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nPeople must submit two medical practitioner reports certifying the treatment is necessary, along with a quote or unpaid invoice that details the expenses.\n\n\"One has to come from a registered medical specialist in the area you are applying to have medical treatment for,\" Dr Bhatia says.\n\nFor IVF, that would be a fertility doctor.\n\n\"The second report has to come from either a registered medical practitioner or another registered medical specialist \u2026 and it does actually say on the ATO website that your application must include a medical report from psychiatrist,\" Dr Bhatia says.\n\nFinancial educator and behavioural money coach Natasha Janssens says people also need to show they can't pay for the expenses by other means, such as by obtaining a loan.\n\nHow did you manage the cost of IVF? We'd love to hear from you to help cover stories in this space: lifestyle@abc.net.au\n\nHow much super could you ultimately lose?\n\nThe cost of withdrawing your superannuation early is likely to be more than what you take out, due to the missed returns of compounding interest.\n\nIf retirement is 30 years away, Ms Janssens says a \"general rule of thumb\" is that it will ultimately cost you about double what you withdraw.\n\n\"These numbers won't be set in stone \u2014 there are so many variables \u2014 but \u2026 a 35-year-old taking out $20,000 now means they are going to have about $42,000 less at retirement [age],\" she says.\n\nYou can test your own circumstances by adjusting the \"super balance\" entry of the MoneySmart superannuation calculator to factor in how much you intend to withdraw.\n\nIs egg freezing really an 'insurance policy'? Photo shows A brunette woman stands in the street holding a cup of ice cream. She wears a white tank top and denim skirt. Egg freezing is often sold by fertility clinics as an \"insurance policy\". But some experts say it's more like a lottery, and few women return to use their frozen eggs.\n\nUnexpected costs\n\nThe super you withdraw on compassionate grounds is paid and taxed as a normal super lump sum.\n\nThere may also be other costs you don't expect, says Ms Janssens.\n\nThat was the case for Cyndi.\n\n\"Taking out two lots of $16,000 in one financial year, I didn't realise it would affect my income.\n\n\"Having that extra $32,000 income on my tax return, meant I had to pay an extra $5,000 on my HECS debt.\"\n\nFor couples undertaking IVF, either party can apply to access their super for treatment if they meet certain criteria, however, Dr Bhatia says her research shows more women than men access their super early for IVF.\n\n\"And we know women [already] have less super than men.\"\n\nThere are specialist companies that offer to help people access their super early.\n\nNot every IVF journey ends with a baby. (Pexels)\n\nCyndi paid $1,000 to one of these companies the first time.\n\n\"After that I actually felt like a bit of an idiot because I realised how simple it was.\"\n\nDr Bhatia says some of the companies advertise their services on fertility clinic websites, and in some cases, fertility clinics refer people to them.\n\nA conflict of interest?\n\nDr Bhatia says people should be able to access their superannuation if they wish, but the involvement of fertility clinics in the process concerns her.\n\nShe says it can be a \"closed-loop system\" where clinics are the ones providing information about accessing super to their patients.\n\nIt's also possible for a fertility doctor from an IVF clinic to be one of the certifying doctors for the application.\n\n\"To my mind that is a conflict of interest. It's an industry that is worth over $6 billion; they have their own vested interest.\n\n\"We do need greater regulatory oversight \u2026 in that process.\"\n\nManuela Toledo is a board member with the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand, medical director at TasIVF and a fertility specialist at Melbourne IVF.\n\nShe says the decision to access super for fertility treatment \"should not come from the clinics\".\n\n\"FSANZ strongly recommends that this process be independent of the clinics and the treating fertility doctors.\"\n\nFinancial advice 'should be mandatory'\n\nDr Bhatia says financial counselling should be a mandatory part of the process to help people \"take a breather and think about what other ways there might be.\"\n\nMs Janssens says it would be \"wise\" to speak to a financial adviser, counsellor, accountant, or your super fund to get a greater understanding of your individual circumstances, adding that people should consider how they will replenish the money they withdraw.\n\nCyndi says she doesn't regret accessing her superannuation early.\n\n\"I do think about it in the sense that that money could be a lot down the line, but I don't dwell on it.\n\n\"I made the decision, what's done it done. I have my son, and life will play out as it will.\"\n\nKey takeaways Australians are increasingly accessing their superannuation early to fund IVF treatment.\n\nThe cost of withdrawing your superannuation early is likely to be more than what you take out. For many people undertaking IVF in their 30s, it will be roughly double at retirement.\n\nSome experts are concerned about the involvement of fertility clinics in the process, noting a \"conflict of interest\".\n\nUndertaking independent financial advice could help mitigate some risks.\n\nThis article contains general information only.

        "text": "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great turned media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism that featured a picture of a rat.\n\nThe 64-year-old, who is the British national broadcaster's highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($2.6 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show Match of the Day at the end of this season, but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year's men's World Cup.\n\nHowever, the BBC said on Monday, local time, in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final Match of the Day episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \"Zionism explained in two minutes.\"\n\nRats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s.\n\nBBC sports is in hot water. What\u2019s it all about? Photo shows Soccer broadcaster Gary Lineker holding a microphone Here's a look at who Gary Lineker is, the debate surrounding his comments, and how it has affected the BBC.\n\n\"Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made,\" BBC director-general Tim Davie said.\n\n\"Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.\"\n\nLineker had already apologised for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \"offensive references,\" adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \"would never knowingly share anything anti-Semitic\".\n\nBefore Lineker's apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \"exemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\" and that \"when someone makes a mistake, it costs us\".\n\n\"Football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\" Lineker said in the BBC statement.\n\n\"I care deeply about the game, and about the work I've done with the BBC over many years. As I've said, I would never consciously repost anything anti-Semitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.\n\n\" However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action. \"\n\nIn a separate video post on Instagram, Lineker said he had made a \"genuine mistake\" and \"should have been more diligent\".\n\n\"I have stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and all forms of racism all of my life, including of course antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no place for it, and never should be.\"\n\nStrained relationship with the BBC\n\nLineker's openness to reflect his political views on social media has caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.\n\nHe was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticising the then-Conservative government's new asylum policy.\n\nGary Lineker is the highest paid presenter at the BBC and has been a stalwart in its football coverage. (Getty Images: Michael Regan)\n\nIt led to the BBC's rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \"responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".\n\nLineker was among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.\n\nLast week, in an interview with the UK's The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \"almost complicit\".\n\nLineker's media career\n\nThe BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well-known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.\n\nLineker is one of England's greatest players \u2014 he scored 48 goals in 80 games for his country and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico \u2014 who transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling, with 8.7 million followers on X and 1.2 million followers on Instagram.\n\nGary Lineker in Augusta for the BBC while covering The Masters in 2006. (Getty Images: David Cannon)\n\nHe has been the main presenter of BBC's Match of the Day since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.\n\nLineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful Goalhanger podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.\n\nReaction to Lineker's departure\n\nLineker's departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \"a symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster\".\n\nLineker, the group added, was \"repeatedly allowed to flout the BBC's own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanising and extreme messages\".\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nLineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target, but for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain's most popular figures.\n\n\"Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\" Davie said.\n\n\"His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\"\n\nMatch of the Day \u2014 a late-night program that has been running since the 60s and is regarded as an institution in Britain \u2014 will be hosted by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season.

        "text": "If 2005 rom-com Just Like Heaven hinged on Mark Ruffalo helping the ghost of Reese Witherspoon jolt her body to life and find her one true love, Thai comedy The Red Envelope is about a man helping a ghost he has been betrothed to achieve his dream of getting married and reincarnated. It is as culturally specific as it gets.\n\nFast Facts about The Red Envelope What: A deeply silly platonic love story between a gay ghost and a straight man Directed by: Chayanop Bonnprakob Starring: Billkin, PP Krit, Piyamas Monyakul, Anna Chuancheun Where: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: Tickled and, despite yourself, moved\n\nThe ghost is the spirit of gay man Titi, whose wishes to get married in life were thwarted by a prejudiced father. On his last day on Earth, Titi had a fight with his father and died in a hit-and-run car accident while in an anguished state.\n\nIn a posthumous scheme hatched by Titi's amah (Piyamas Monyakul) \u2014 perhaps the most progressive grandma to ever live \u2014 whoever stumbles upon a red envelope with Titi's lock of hair and cut fingernails will be his husband for perpetuity.\n\nThat person turns out to be Menn, a petty criminal-turned-informant who fools men and women alike in sting operations that often go wrong due to his general uselessness. Crucially, he's also a homophobic straight man, despite his penchant for masquerading as a gay man when it suits him.\n\nTiti's amah (Piyamas Monyakul) will not let anything get in the way of her marriage matchmaking, including his death. (Supplied: Cine Asia Films)\n\nThe Red Envelope's draw rests on its two superstar leads: Thai actor-singers PP Krit and Billkin, who play Titi and Menn respectively. This is not the first time they have acted together, however \u2014 their joint breakout roles were in the queer coming-of-age TV series I Told Sunset About You and its sequel I Promised You the Moon.\n\nThe rapport between them is palpable as Menn's prejudice gives way to care and he becomes accustomed to the presence of a ghost in his apartment, while Titi discovers things about his life that shatter his understanding of himself and his loved ones.\n\nThe other thing that must be said: The Red Envelope is patently ridiculous, comically overblown and absurdly camp.\n\nBillkin (left) became a household name after starring in 2024's How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies, which was the first Thai film to be shortlisted at the Oscars. (Supplied: Cine Asia Films)\n\nThe low-fi special effects as Titi jumps out of photo frames and glides through the air like he is on roller-skates \u2014 I suspect this is the case, because we never see his feet \u2014 make the technology of late 90s TV adaptation Animorphs look sophisticated. The one horror scene in the film is so overdone it is ludicrous.\n\nTiti's ability to possess anyone leads to uproarious outcomes, particularly in the case of Menn. One particularly memorable scene revolves around Menn undergoing a makeover as he pretends to be a gay man in order to infiltrate a queer club \u2014 the transformation hinges on an outfit that an archetypal straight man like Menn would not be capable of conjuring.\n\nChallenged to a dance battle that is most reminiscent of White Chicks, Menn is possessed by Titi, who takes pity on him, and soon his stilted dance moves give way to stylised voguing and impeccable choreography.\n\nTiti and Menn must work together to solve the mystery of who killed him. (Supplied: Cine Asia Films)\n\nThe emotional core of the film begins to emerge after the first act as Menn starts to work with Titi to track down his killer, a case that neatly segues into Menn's own mission to discover the identity of a drug overlord who remains at large. Motivated initially by his wish to vanquish Titi permanently from his life \u2014 the theory is that Titi will be reincarnated if he finds peace \u2014 Menn starts to discover the benefits of having a close friend, when he previously had none.\n\nThe Red Envelope is a remake of 2022 Taiwanese blockbuster Marry My Dead Body, but it has a tongue-in-cheek script that references its own distinct influences, from Thai horror film Shutter to South Korean social realist drama Parasite.\n\nAt times, the film struggles to balance its sillier aspects with the ever-growing seriousness of the dual mysteries that it is trying to resolve. Did it have to be 2 hours 8 minutes? Almost certainly not.\n\nLess a rom-com and more a buddy cop bromance between the unlikeliest of partners, The Red Envelope tugs on the heartstrings \u2014 particularly in a stirring climactic performance by Titi's father (Anna Chuanchuen) \u2014 even as it remains a deeply unserious film.",

(ABC News: Dean Faulkner)\n\nUnion welcomes legal action\n\nSecretary of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union's (CEPU) South Australian branch John Adley told ABC Radio Adelaide he first became aware of the issue two years ago, when workers began falling \"seriously ill\".\n\n\"There was inability to sleep, weight loss, physical illness, inability to eat, chronic fatigue ... and these went for a very long period of time and it was particularly concerning for workers because they didn't really know why it was happening,\" Mr Adley said.\n\nTorrens Island lead exposure Photo shows A man with a serious expression stands in front of a brick wall Sean Gibbons says he started experiencing fatigue, stomach upsets, pins and needles in his legs, and insomnia after helping decommission AGL's Torrens Island power plant.\n\n\"It wasn't until there was an investigation into what was suspected to be lead paint that the toxicity and the danger of the lead cables became apparent to the workers.\"\n\nMr Adley said he believed the charges would send a \"strong message\" to employers about the risks of lead.\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty rare to see this kind of charge being laid,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a lack of awareness generally about the risks of lead, and this is a big concern.\n\n\"Lead is extremely sticky and what has happened in this case and other cases is that workers working with lead take lead home on them and it can cause serious illness to their families and particularly their children who are very susceptible to lead.\"\n\nSA Premier Peter Malinauskas said he welcomed SafeWork taking \"strong action\" against AGL.\n\n\"If it is confirmed through a court process that AGL is guilty of the charges that have been laid, that is a very poor reflection on them indeed,\" Mr Malinauskas said.\n\n\"This is a highly profitable company that has the capacity and wherewithal to make sure that their workers are safe.\n\n\"We should never see profit trump the safety of employees ... this is something we want SafeWork to actively police.\"",

        "text": "The West Australian roads authority has drawn fire for bulldozing and closing off a rest stop that illegal campers used as a dumping ground.\n\nThe Marbelup rest stop, about halfway between Albany and Denmark on the south coast, was left looking like a landfill site after the recent school holidays due to illegal campers and dumping.\n\nMain Roads said the rest stop had become too difficult to manage. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nRubbish left in the area included piles of razors, food waste and an excrement-filled portable toilet.\n\nMain Roads WA, which manages the South Coast Highway and its rest stops, initially suggested people misusing the rest area would be tracked down and fined.\n\nBut travellers in the area this week found the rest stop had been bulldozed and all access had been blocked.\n\nThe former rest area has been bulldozed and fenced off. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nMain Roads Great Southern regional director Andrew Duffield said ongoing misuse of the site and limited resources led to the closure.\n\n\"The decision there was based on our inability to be able to control people doing all the things it was suggested they were doing in there,\" he said.\n\n\" We've had a bit of a history of people trashing that site \u2014 there are no bins there and people are just using it as a dump site. \"\n\nRazors and toilet paper were also found scattered across the rest stop. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nMr Duffield said the department had been reviewing rest stops on the network and chose to revegetate the site due to its proximity to the City of Albany.\n\n\"People could come into Albany if they're heading this way. We don't see that as a fatigue risk,\" he said.\n\nThe Marbelup rest area is the third stop in the south-west that Main Roads has closed in the past two years. However Mr Duffield said the department was reinvesting resources in the improvment of other rest stops on the network.\n\nSince January 2023, Main Roads has built 11 rest areas, upgraded 13 and closed nine across the WA network.\n\n'Huge impact'\n\nThe closure has angered some road users, including the Australian Caravan Club, which said the decision was \"disappointing\" and posed safety issues for all road users.\n\nDeputy chair Tom Smith said alternative management options should have been explored before the site was closed.\n\n\"Quite a high percentage of our members prefer to use these facilities when they're travelling to save money,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not the RV or the caravan that creates the mess, because a lot of them have got their facilities on board.\n\n\" It's other people who do it and you just shake your head sometimes when you see these pigsties. \"\n\nMr Smith said regardless of its proximity to town, the closure posed a safety risk.\n\n\"Fatigue management is very important to people, especially as you get older, not just for the grey nomads but for anybody driving on the road,\" he said.\n\nMain Roads says it is closing some rest areas and redistributing maintenance resources to others. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nShort supply\n\nWestern Roads Federation chief executive Cam Dumesny said the closure of the rest area highlighted a worrying trend.\n\n\"There's actually not enough of them as it is across the state,\" he said.\n\n\"We need those rest areas so the drivers can pull in, [and] have their fatigue brakes, which [they] are legally mandated to do. So losing rest areas when we've already got a shortage is certainly a major impact.\"\n\nRough surface signs are dotted along the South Coast highway to warn drivers of the poor road condition. (ABC News: Andrew Chounding)\n\nMr Dumesny said the federation and Livestock and Rural Transport Association had lobbied the government to develop and upgrade heavy vehicle rest areas across the state.\n\n\"We all want these rest areas when driving a car or a caravan or a truck,\" he said.\n\n\"We've all got a social responsibility, like a barbecue at a community park \u2014 we use it, we clean it afterwards so that the next person can use it.\n\n\"That element seems to be missing.\"",

        "text": "When it comes to sport Americans seem to have a turn of phrase for everything and one particular piece of Yankee wisdom hangs over the fresh New South Wales halves duo of Nathan Cleary and Mitchell Moses.\n\nIf you have two quarterbacks, they say, you really don't have one.\n\nFor a good while, the Blues didn't have one at all. The halfback jersey was a poisoned chalice, until Cleary and then Moses drunk deep, stood steady and asked for more.\n\nCleary has already played in that position for New South Wales more times than anyone except Andrew Johns and won more series as a halfback than anyone bar Johns and Ricky Stuart.\n\nOrigin II was the game of a lifetime for Mitchell Moses Photo shows A man kicks a ball during a State of Origin match More often than not, the New South Wales halfback spot can be a poisoned chalice but under the harshest of scrutiny Mitchell Moses produced the game of his life.\n\nMoses's experience is less extensive, but his man-of-the-match showing in Melbourne and the way he plunged a dagger into Queensland's heart in Brisbane last year was proof he's made of the true steel.\n\nAs they prepare to play together for the first time, what faces them at Lang Park is a different challenge \u2014 how do a pair of the best and most dominant halves in rugby league find a way to fit together? They can both lead, but can they follow?\n\nAfter a lifetime of learning the art and science of play-making, which is the hardest task rugby league has to offer, can they share a crown? How do two quarterbacks become one?\n\nBoth Cleary and Moses average a shade over 60 touches per game, putting them third and fourth for possessions among regular halves. It's been a long time since it was any other way for them, because they've been in command of every team they've played on for many years now.\n\nCleary hasn't had to play second fiddle since 2019, before the premierships and the dynasty and the Clive Churchill Medals. Back then, when he was still Penrith's prince and not quite it's king, he partnered James Maloney for club and state.\n\nFor Moses, you have to go back even further, close to a decade. But in his mind, there's no doubt as to where things will stand come Wednesday night.\n\n\"He's the seven. That excites me \u2014 I haven't done that since I was playing five-eighth at the Tigers in the early days,\" Moses said.\n\n\"It excites me to play with a dominant halfback, where I can just pick my opportunities.\"\n\nMoses last played five-eighth at Wests Tigers back in 2017. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer )\n\nCleary sees it slightly differently, as more of a give-and-take. In his mind, one player does not necessarily need to overwhelm the other.\n\n\"It's an understanding, not letting our egos get in the way, doing what's best for the team at that time and having those discussions about what that looks like at certain times of the game,\" Cleary said.\n\n\"We both understand the game pretty well, so that will help, but it's all about complimenting each other.\"\n\nThe pair are different styles of halfbacks, but they share a versatility that should boost their combination.\n\nBoth are adept at playing both sides of the field and can operate equally well out of first and second receiver. Given the physical and direct nature of his play, Cleary is more known for his work in the former but much of his finest hour \u2014 the closing stages of the 2023 grand final \u2014 came in the latter as he took on more of a creative role following a shoulder injury to Jarome Luai.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nLike so much of Penrith's recent glories, it was a showcase of his problem-solving abilities and relentless nature, which is what Moses admires most about Cleary.\n\n\"He competes on every play. He's the ultimate competitor, he's shown that his whole career,\" Moses said.\n\n\"It excites me, to play with a player like that who doesn't leave anything to chance out on the field.\"\n\nMoses showed a similar ability to excel off the ball as recently as Parramatta's win over Newcastle last Friday. Two of his best moments of the night came in chasing kicks from halves partner Dylan Brown.\n\nThe first was for the opening try, when Moses flew through to claim a bomb. The second was for Zac Lomax's second score, when Moses tapped a kick back to create the chance for support players.\n\nOverall, Brown had more touches than Moses on the night as the Eels scored the most points they have in a game all season.\n\nMoses's presence, be it as the primary or secondary playmaker, also opens up the options for the Blues kicking game. It's what Cleary, whose boot is one of his best attributes and primary weapons, admires most about the Parramatta man's game.\n\n\"His kicking game, particularly his long kicking, is exceptional. I think it's the best in the game at the moment,\" Cleary said.\n\n\"But also his running game \u2014 he's pretty well-rounded, but those two stand out to me. His defence has also gone to another level as well, he gets in there and he's aggressive.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe nuts and bolts of the combination are still being tightened \u2014 at the time of writing, the Blues had only one training session under their belt \u2014 but if it can hold the side together, New South Wales will be staring a second consecutive series win right in the eye.\n\nIt's an accolade that would do much for both their legacies. Cleary hasn't played in a winning series in four years and as well as Moses played last year, his own Origin career is still just five games old \u2014 this will be the first time he's played in a series opener.\n\nGetting there will require a different kind of skills to those they know so well and worked so hard to master.\n\nFor both Moses and Cleary, getting as much of the ball as they wanted exactly when they wanted it has been the solution to just about every problem rugby league has ever thrown at them.\n\nThey have learned to be great by learning to dominate but if they can learn to let go just a touch, to cede a bit of control, to trust someone who is so like them and wear their trust in return, they can be greater still.\n\nIt is hard to put your faith in the unfamiliar when faith in yourself has taken you so far but if Moses and Cleary can give up just a little, they can have it all.",

        "text": "The last time Tottenham Hotspur won a European trophy it proved to be manager Keith Burkinshaw's last game in charge, and as the club arrives in Bilbao for Thursday's (AEST) Europa League final against Manchester United, history could be repeating itself.\n\nBurkinshaw is regarded as one of the club's greatest managers, taking the north London club to back-to-back FA Cup triumphs and then the 1984 UEFA Cup after a memorable two-legged final decided on penalties at White Hart Lane.\n\nShortly after that epic night, Burkinshaw parted company with Spurs over disagreements with the board and as local legend would have it, his parting words as he walked away were, \"There used to be a football club over there\".\n\nForty-one years and countless managers later, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces a game that could well be his last \u2014 win or lose against United in northern Spain.\n\nIt has been a miserable Premier League season for Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou. (Getty Images: PA Images/Ben Whitley)\n\nTottenham has suffered its worst ever Premier League season with 21 defeats, the same number Burkinshaw's side lost in 1976-77 when they were relegated to the old second division.\n\nBurkinshaw survived, led the club back after one season and blazed an audacious trail by signing Argentina World Cup winners Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricky Villa for the club.\n\nWhile 17th-placed Tottenham has avoided relegation, Postecoglou's demeanour as the Premier League losses racked up has been that of a man who knows his time might be up.\n\nFormer Tottenham great Micky Hazard, part of the 1981-82 FA Cup final team and who famously lost a contact lens in the mud after scoring in the 1983-84 UEFA Cup semifinal win against Hajduk Split, says Burkinshaw's departure cost the club the chance of winning more silverware.\n\nHe strongly believes Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy should stick with Postecoglou if the Australian delivers the Europa League and ends a 17-year trophy drought on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's important that they get out of that cycle, win or bust, win or bust, win or bust,\" the 65-year-old Hazard said.\n\n\"Look through history and you look at Alex Ferguson. He took five or six years to win things with Manchester United and then he won things non-stop.\n\n\"Success \u2014 it's not overnight, and the longer it takes to get it, the more solid the foundation is.\n\n\"Alex Ferguson built on his first five years of not winning a trophy by winning everything for the next 20 years.\n\n\"When Keith [Burkinshaw] was allowed to resign I thought it was a big, big loss. I didn't agree with it.\n\n\"Will Ange stay? I'm of the belief that winning a trophy is the most amazing thing in football. I always say that if someone wins a trophy they have earned the right to have another crack.\n\n\"Would it be right to get rid of someone that changed the mentality and got the club over the line?\"\n\nThe Europa League final gives Postecoglou the chance to salvage something from Tottenham's season. (Getty Images: Danehouse/Harry Murphy)\n\nHazard says Tottenham must play without fear against United and said despite missing several key players because of injury, there can be no excuses.\n\n\"Injuries are part and parcel of football,\" he said.\n\n\"In 1984 we were without [Glenn] Hoddle, Ardiles, [Steve] Perryman, [Ray] Clemence and [Garth] Crooks and we went and won it.\n\n\"Look for excuses and you find excuses. It's an opportunity for players coming in to go and win a European final.\n\n\"Winning a cup final means playing with no fear, being brave. You don't just turn up in a final and it all goes your way. Nobody's going to give you this, you have to earn it.\"\n\nTottenham will play Manchester United in the Europa League final on Thursday, May 22 at 5am (AEST).

        "text": "Westpac's chief economist Luci Ellis is forecasting a 0.25 percentage point cut today, with two further cuts this year.\n\nThe former RBA Assistant Governor Luci Ellis told Kirsten Aiken on The Business that the cuts are likely to come in August and November.\n\n\"We think the Reserve Bank's still concerned about lingering inflation pressures so they won't be in a hurry even though the economic situation is looking worse,\" she said.\n\nThe economic teams at the big four banks have divergent views, with forecasts varying between three and five cuts in the next 12 months.\n\nLuci Ellis says part of that's because of different takes on the risks around the global economy, but also different interpretations of how the RBA is seeing the world.\n\n\"We've had a good six or nine months where the Reserve Bank has been very hawkish on inflation risks. It's trying to fine tune the inflation result to show a sustained forecast at 2.5 per cent,\" she said. \"One of the reasons they were so hawkish in February was their forecast said trimmed mean inflation is going to be stuck at 2.7 instead of 2.5 (per cent) and their interpretation on the statement on the conduct of monetary policy says you should be aiming for the midpoint of the target range which is 2.2 (per cent). \"So, I think you know, not everybody is sort of keying into those particular nuances of how the RBA is seeing the world, or maybe they're sort of putting more trust in the idea that the RBA will change its mind.\"\n\nLuci Ellis explains the RBA is also out of consensus in terms of its February forecasts around consumption growth.\n\nWestpac is expecting household consumption to increase by 1.5% over calendar 2025, which is the median of the market forecasts.\n\n\"The February forecast from the RBA was 2.6. They're well out of consensus. They're very bullish about the tendency for people to pick up their spending. But that's not what we're seeing in our own Westpac DataX data. It's not what we're seeing in the ABS data,\" she said.\n\nYou can watch the full interview with Lucy Ellis here:",

        "text": "An Australian study estimated 50 per cent of cases could be linked to a genetic risk and a meta-analysis, including 60,674 endometriosis cases and 701,926 controls, found 42 genetic regions associated with a risk of endometriosis. Having a mother or sister with endometriosis increases the likelihood of developing the condition by about 7 per cent. The endometriosis dilemma Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) grows in other parts of the body, most commonly the pelvis. It can also spread through other organs, forming scar tissue and often causing severe pain and other distressing symptoms. One in three cases leads to infertility. An estimated one in nine girls and women in Australia has endometriosis. It\u2019s one in seven among women aged 47 to 52 and hospitalisation rates for endometriosis among 20- to 24-year-olds have doubled in the past decade to 660 per 100,000 females. Investment in understanding the basic science of endometriosis is 30 years behind, leading to damaging delays in diagnosis (on average, eight years from symptom onset in Australia) and effective treatments. The economic burden of endometriosis in Australia is an estimated $7.4 billion to $9.7 billion annually. Adele Taylor described her abdomen as a pin cushion of cuts and laparoscopy holes from the 16 surgeries to burn, cut and laser the cysts and lesions of her fast-growing endometriosis. During her teenage years, her doctors had no explanation for the cysts and lesions. Since she was 13, she had shockingly painful periods, terrible bloating and heavy bleeding that seeped through her school uniforms.\n\n\u201cI was one of those young girls who went to GPs and was told it was all in my head,\u201d Taylor said. Her first surgery was booked only because the pain of an ovarian cyst was mistaken for appendicitis when she was 15. Taylor was diagnosed with endometriosis at 19, six years after she first experienced symptoms. The lesions had spread rapidly through several of her organs. Her 20s were characterised by pain and more surgeries. Hormone treatment made her nauseated and played havoc with her moods, threatening to derail a burgeoning corporate career. Adele Taylor\u2019s treatment odyssey included 16 surgeries and hormone treatment that made her ill. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong Taylor\u2019s gynaecologist told her not to put off having children since she may struggle to conceive. She gave birth to her daughter, Charley, in her early 30s. While Taylor breastfed, her endometriosis seemed to have paused only to \u201creturn with a vengeance\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had extensive surgery, which involved cutting away some of my organs, including my bowel, to attack it and remove the endo,\u201d she said. \u201cScar-tissue-wise, it\u2019s pretty awful in there.\u201d Loading Under Abbott\u2019s care, Taylor moved to a daily pain medication regimen aimed at treating the symptoms of her endometriosis with minimal surgery and lifestyle changes, including running, strength training and a balanced diet. \u201cHe was focused not only on treating the condition, but recognising I\u2019d been through a pretty awful experience,\u201d said Taylor, now an avid runner who recently completed the New York Half Marathon. \u201cI will be on medication for the rest of my life [but] I\u2019ve had good pain relief for a decade [and] almost seven years when I didn\u2019t need surgery.\u201d\n\nJess Taylor, chair of peak body the Australian Coalition for Endometriosis, characterised current endometriosis treatment as \u201cthrowing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks in terms of treatment options\u201d. \u201cHaving an entire institution dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of endo and all the systems it impacts across the body puts this condition on a whole new playing field,\u201d she said. Professor Caroline Ford, the scientific director of UNSW\u2019s AERI, with clinical director Professor Jason Abbott. Credit: Peter Rae AERI is expected to partner with top international scientists, clinicians, and philanthropists, focusing on genomic research, biobanks of endometriosis tissue, and advanced testing. Professor Caroline Ford, AERI\u2019s scientific director, said the institute would build a strong evidence base to support doctors in offering personalised medical care for each endometriosis patient.\n\n\u201cThis substantial investment will allow researchers for the first time to build a solid understanding of endometriosis biology and pathogenesis that will lead to improved detection, management and treatment,\u201d Ford said. UNSW said AERI was only possible with the $50 million donation by the Ainsworth family. Anna and her daughter Lily Ainsworth have both experienced the debilitating effects of the disease. Lily Ainsworth has lived with endometriosis since she was 15 years old, with daily chronic pain and severe, debilitating flare-ups that could last weeks. Anna and Lily Ainsworth at UNSW. Credit: UNSW \u201cThis reality is shared with millions of people living with endo around Australia and the world. We believe this can change,\u201d Ainsworth said.\n\nLed by patriarch Len Ainsworth, founder of two of the world\u2019s biggest pokies manufacturing companies, Aristocrat Leisure and Ainsworth Game Technology, the family is building a philanthropic legacy by donating tens of millions to institutions, universities, hospitals and art galleries. Loading UNSW has an Ainsworth Building in its engineering and manufacturing facility after a $10 million donation. UNSW academics, who declined to speak on record, are among critics of institutions that accept these donations. They say the family\u2019s philanthropy should not overshadow the harms inflicted by pokies. Anti-gambling advocate Tim Costello said that when universities and other \u201cpowerful culture bearers and gatekeepers in society\u201d take Ainsworth\u2019s money, \u201cgambling reform becomes so much harder\u201d.",

        "text": "The chances of elevated inflation and stagflation (higher inflation with lower economic growth) were greater than people thought, he warned. Yet, US asset prices were high and credit spreads (the differences in yields between securities with similar maturities but different risk levels) didn\u2019t reflect the impact of a potential downturn. \u201cCredit today is a bad risk,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThe people who haven\u2019t been through a major downturn are missing the point about what can happen in credit.\u201d \u201cCredit today is a bad risk,\u201d says JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Credit: AP In a significant economic downturn, lenders will not lend to companies that are perceived as risky, or demand they pay higher interest rates. The spreads between government bond yields, the most creditworthy companies and higher-risk companies would widen. Default rates and the numbers of corporate collapses would increase. With a recession, particularly a stagflationary one, companies would face higher borrowing costs to reflect the increased risk even as their sales and profitability come under pressure.\n\nMoody\u2019s may only have been telling people what they already knew, or should have known, but its assessment of America\u2019s deteriorating public finances ought to be unnerving investors - particularly as it appears that, after last-minute concessions from Congressional leaders, Trump\u2019s \u201cOne, Big, Beautiful Bill Act\u201d is likely to be endorsed by House Republicans. Loading The US, with deficits approaching $US2 trillion ($3.1 trillion) and government debt of $US36.2 trillion already, is facing the addition of another $US3 trillion to $US4 trillion or more of debt over the next decade as a result of the tax cuts and spending plans in that bill. The bond market will have to absorb that extra issuance of debt as well as the rolling-over of maturing debt, placing upward pressure on bond yields. That would in turn flow through to borrowing costs across the economy With the Biden administration\u2019s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issuing mainly short-dated securities during Biden\u2019s presidency and her successor in the Trump administration Scott Bessent pursuing a similar strategy to keep the pressure off the yields on longer-term bonds, the market\u2019s appetite for US debt will be tested by the surge in supply from both the existing debt rolling over and the new debt flowing from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nThe ability of the bond market to soak up the volume of debt heading its way will also be challenged by the aftershocks of Trump\u2019s trade policies. Loading Tariffs are taxes on domestic consumption, whether felt directly by consumers or absorbed via lower profit margins by the importing companies. When their effects eventually show up, as they will, they will push the inflation rate up and the economic growth rate down. The increased deficits and debt could, therefore, coincide with a higher inflation rate and a slowing economy, even a Trump-induced recession. An increase in inflation and interest rates even as the economy is slowing is a recipe for something quite unpleasant. Trump, of course, doesn\u2019t believe his beloved tariffs will impact inflation or growth because he continues to believe, or at least say, that they are paid by the exporting countries.\n\nThat\u2019s despite a growing list of US companies warning that they are already experiencing cost pressures from the tariffs and will have to pass at least some of those costs onto their customers. \u201cHe (Trump) maintains the position that foreign countries absorb these tariffs,\u201d the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. Why then did Trump attack Walmart at the weekend for warning that it would have to raise its prices to reflect the impact of the tariffs? \u201cWalmart should STOP trying to blame the tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should...EAT THE TARIFFS, and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I\u2019ll be watching and so will your customers,\u201d he posted on social media.\n\nIf the tariffs are actually absorbed by foreign countries, why would Walmart or China have to \u201ceat\u201d anything? The reality is, as Walmart and other US retailers are only too aware, that they are the ones importing the goods and, even if the exporters are prepared to absorb something of the tariff impacts, they and their customers will be the ones bearing the brunt of the costs. That\u2019s been the history of trade wars. Loading Walmart\u2019s profits haven\u2019t surprised anyone and, in the very competitive US retail environment, aren\u2019t extraordinary. The group\u2019s profit margin in the first quarter of this year was about 2.7 per cent and its retail margin (earnings before interest and tax relative to sales) a modest 4.3 per cent. The world\u2019s biggest retailer is always going to post profits in the multi-billions of dollars, but it doesn\u2019t have the profit margins to absorb the tariff impacts in their entirety. Even if it did, the lower profitability would probably mean less employment and investment by the company and lower dividends and a lower share price for shareholders.",

The ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) last year granted SunCable a conditional licence to import Australian electricity from 2035. More broadly, Singapore\u2019s geography at the juncture of strategic waters is as significant now, if not more so in these unpredictable times, as it was when Sir Stamford Raffles set up shop more than 200 years ago. Playing a smart, middle-power role, Singapore maintains good relationships with both China and the US and has long been a beacon of stability among its regional neighbours, which are troubled with coups, corruption and crisis. It is a good friend to have in troubled seas. Albanese\u2019s visit is short, however. He\u2019ll spend only a couple of hours in Singapore before flying to Canberra on Tuesday night.\n\nLoading Australia and Singapore have both escaped US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff calls with a 10 per cent flat rate. Still, global trade is Singapore\u2019s heartbeat, and any disruption to the pre-Trump status quo will be keenly felt here. Wong, who is paid a salary of $2.6 million, is still little known outside his homeland. But he seems a considered and mild-mannered kind of guy. Like Australia, he did not retaliate with further tariffs on the US. And like Albanese, he ventured to say the tariffs were \u201cnot actions one does to a close friend\u201d. As a politician, he also played on the US economic threat to keep would-be straying voters in the arms of what they\u2019ve always known. The two PMs have at least several years of clear electoral air to build their personal relationship and strategies for dulling the unwieldy Trumpian knife.\n\nAlbanese and Wong were both elected on May 3. It was Wong\u2019s first election since taking the job from Lee Hsien Loong last year. With a strong showing (Wong\u2019s PAP won about 65 per cent of the popular vote), the prime ministership is now essentially his for as long as he wants to keep it and the party lets him. Wong, 52, is only Singapore\u2019s fourth prime minister in six decades of independence. Lee held the post for 20 years, long enough for Australia to cycle through seven prime ministers. Wong and Albanese at the APEC Summit in Peru in November. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Both nations\u2019 open economies are deeply wedded to international norms, but the styles of democracy are vastly different. Singapore is dominated by the undefeated PAP \u2013 the product, in part, of its good track record, expert gerrymandering, a compliant mainstream media and the party\u2019s suppression of free speech and protests. Wong has shown no inclination to mess with the winning formula. The main opposition party fielded only 26 candidates for 97 seats in parliament in the May 3 election. It won 10. Again, the PAP will be able to do as it pleases.\n\nLoading Don\u2019t expect Albanese to raise any of this. But he will point out that Australia was among the first nations to establish diplomatic ties with Singapore when it separated from Malaysia 60 years ago this year. In that time, \u201cthe little red dot\u201d has grown into a wealthy middle-power of influence, one of the great financial hubs and ports of the world. Singapore and Australia are awash in bilateral and joint multilateral agreements ranging from free trade to defence. One of them, the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative, will have at its peak 14,000 Singaporean troops training for more than four months of the year in Queensland. Another deal, the comprehensive strategic partnership, is due to be renewed this year and could be the subject of announcements on Tuesday.",

On 16 May, the ASX indicated a 96 per cent expectation of an interest rate cut \u2014 from the current 4.10 per cent to an expected figure of 3.85 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the March quarter, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 2.4 per cent and the trimmed mean inflation at 2.9 per cent \u2014 figures that fall within the 2-3 per cent range the RBA considers healthy inflation, thus raising expectations of a rate cut.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith housing affordability being closely linked to the RBA's decisions on the cash rate, this much-anticipated decision could influence house prices for those looking to buy property in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom property market watchers to keen buyers \u2014 anyone with an interest in Australia's real estate sector will be looking for an answer to the big question: Will a rate cut make housing more affordable?\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News\n\nWill a rate cut drive house prices up?\n\nProperty market analyst Tim Lawless said a rate cut can be a downside for affordability when you compare dwelling values to income.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News that when prospective home owners can to borrow more after a rate cut, it historically puts pressure on the housing market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We probably will see some additional upward pressure on housing prices as interest rates come down,\" the head of research at Cotality, formerly CoreLogic, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're already seeing dwelling dollars relative to household incomes quite stretched. In fact, at record highs, we're likely going to see that stretched affordability potentially worsen further from here.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What will be on the RBA\u2019s mind as it weighs a rate cut next week\n\nHe added consumers are also \"increasingly pessimistic\", according to consumer confidence readings, which suggests home buyers feel somewhat locked out of the property market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a clear relationship between confidence and housing markets,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Buying a home is a very high-commitment decision, and if you're more confident in your ability to hold a job and pay down your mortgage or get financing, then you're probably more willing to make the high-commitment decision like that.\"\n\n\n\nWhere are the 'healthy' property markets?\n\nHome buyers in some cities could be feeling more confident than others, as affordability varies widely from state to state.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawless said the most common metric to determine housing affordability is to compare the value of a property with household income as a ratio, also known as the dwelling value to income ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Melbourne's got a ratio of seven, which simply means if you're buying into that market and you have the median household income and you buy the median-priced dwelling, you're spending about seven times your gross annual income,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Melbourne's down towards the bottom of the pack in terms of that affordability ratio, which is a very healthy thing.\"\n\n\n\nIn comparison to Melbourne, most of Australia's capital cities are less affordable by the same measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney had the highest ratio of 9.8, followed by Adelaide on 9, Brisbane on 8.3, Perth on 7.4, and Hobart on 7.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore affordable than Melbourne were the ACT at 6.1 and Darwin at 3.9.\n\n\n\nHow much could you save monthly if the rate is cut?\n\nIf you already have a mortgage, a rate cut of 0.25 percentage points could make a difference to your household budget if the rate stays the same or continues to fall in coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn owner-occupier with a $500,000 loan could save around $76 per month, according to data from the financial comparison website Canstar.\n\n\n\n\n\nA rate cut can also be a good opportunity to see what lenders are offering customers on a variable mortgage loan, according to Sally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison site Canstar.\n\n\n\nCredit: SBS News Doing research ahead of time on the offerings of different banks can be a \"bargaining chip\" in negotiations,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many people, even in the first year or two, the savings you could potentially make would outweigh the effort and the cost of refinancing,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there can be fees you owe your current leader should you switch to a different bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome banks will charge switch fees or have other costs when changing providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

We have tanks that are on the way at the moment, which is a very positive initiative, we've provided now about 1.5 billion dollars in support.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Zelenskyy thanked Mr Albanese for the ongoing support, but urged Australia to apply further sanctions on Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Together we can really move this situation closer to peace, through applying pressure on Russia. We are very thankful for sanctions, I'd also like to raise this topic with you, which is very important, to put more pressure, more sanctions on Russia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Mr Albanese met with European Union President, Ursula Von Der Leyen, who raised the prospect of a formal defence pact between the EU and Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do not only see you as a trading partner, we also see you as a strategic partner. We'd like to broaden this strategic partnership. For example, we have signed defence agreements with South Korea and with Japan, soon with the UK, we would be very pleased if we could build a strategic and defence partnership, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese focused on Australia's strong economic relationship with the E-U in his own comments, a focus which reflects Australia's ongoing efforts to carve out a trade agreement with the E-U.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the question of strengthening Australia's defence relationship with the EU, Mr Albanese responded cautiously, later telling reporters no further detail had been provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was just a suggestion that Ursula Von Der Leyen raised, there was no detail further, it was really just an assertion of Europe's values being consistent with Australia's values, and in what ways could be explored further defence cooperation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, while he did not meet with U-S Vice President J-D Vance, who also attended the inauguration, he did have a brief conversation with the man of the moment, Pope Leo, in St Peter's Basilica after the mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese, who was raised Catholic, says his meeting with the new pontiff was a very positive one.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi\n\n'Will set a new standard'\n\nParents for Climate said the acknowledgement from the energy giant was a \"major win\" and the \"first legal case of its kind in the country to protect the public from 'carbon neutral' greenwashing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not only does this acknowledgement send a powerful message that the era of unchecked greenwashing is over, but it\u2019s incredibly reassuring to see the commitment from one of the largest energy retailers in the country to want to do better for their customers and the climate,\" Nic Seton, CEO of Parents for Climate, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This isn't just about EnergyAustralia \u2014 it's about holding companies to a higher standard across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Greenwashing isn\u2019t harmless.

        "text": "An Australian study estimated 50 per cent of cases could be linked to a genetic risk and a meta-analysis, including 60,674 endometriosis cases and 701,926 controls, found 42 genetic regions associated with a risk of endometriosis. Having a mother or sister with endometriosis increases the likelihood of developing the condition by about 7 per cent. The endometriosis dilemma Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) grows in other parts of the body, most commonly the pelvis. It can also spread through other organs, forming scar tissue and often causing severe pain and other distressing symptoms. One in three cases leads to infertility. An estimated one in nine girls and women in Australia has endometriosis. It\u2019s one in seven among women aged 47 to 52 and hospitalisation rates for endometriosis among 20- to 24-year-olds have doubled in the past decade to 660 per 100,000 females. Investment in understanding the basic science of endometriosis is 30 years behind, leading to damaging delays in diagnosis (on average, eight years from symptom onset in Australia) and effective treatments. The economic burden of endometriosis in Australia is an estimated $7.4 billion to $9.7 billion annually. Adele Taylor described her abdomen as a pin cushion of cuts and laparoscopy holes from the 16 surgeries to burn, cut and laser the cysts and lesions of her fast-growing endometriosis. During her teenage years, her doctors had no explanation for the cysts and lesions. Since she was 13, she had shockingly painful periods, terrible bloating and heavy bleeding that seeped through her school uniforms.\n\n\u201cI was one of those young girls who went to GPs and was told it was all in my head,\u201d Taylor said. Her first surgery was booked only because the pain of an ovarian cyst was mistaken for appendicitis when she was 15. Taylor was diagnosed with endometriosis at 19, six years after she first experienced symptoms. The lesions had spread rapidly through several of her organs. Her 20s were characterised by pain and more surgeries. Hormone treatment made her nauseated and played havoc with her moods, threatening to derail a burgeoning corporate career. Adele Taylor\u2019s treatment odyssey included 16 surgeries and hormone treatment that made her ill. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong Taylor\u2019s gynaecologist told her not to put off having children since she may struggle to conceive. She gave birth to her daughter, Charley, in her early 30s. While Taylor breastfed, her endometriosis seemed to have paused only to \u201creturn with a vengeance\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had extensive surgery, which involved cutting away some of my organs, including my bowel, to attack it and remove the endo,\u201d she said. \u201cScar-tissue-wise, it\u2019s pretty awful in there.\u201d Loading Under Abbott\u2019s care, Taylor moved to a daily pain medication regimen aimed at treating the symptoms of her endometriosis with minimal surgery and lifestyle changes, including running, strength training and a balanced diet. \u201cHe was focused not only on treating the condition, but recognising I\u2019d been through a pretty awful experience,\u201d said Taylor, now an avid runner who recently completed the New York Half Marathon. \u201cI will be on medication for the rest of my life [but] I\u2019ve had good pain relief for a decade [and] almost seven years when I didn\u2019t need surgery.\u201d\n\nJess Taylor, chair of peak body the Australian Coalition for Endometriosis, characterised current endometriosis treatment as \u201cthrowing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks in terms of treatment options\u201d. \u201cHaving an entire institution dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of endo and all the systems it impacts across the body puts this condition on a whole new playing field,\u201d she said. Professor Caroline Ford, the scientific director of UNSW\u2019s AERI, with clinical director Professor Jason Abbott. Credit: Peter Rae AERI is expected to partner with top international scientists, clinicians, and philanthropists, focusing on genomic research, biobanks of endometriosis tissue, and advanced testing. Professor Caroline Ford, AERI\u2019s scientific director, said the institute would build a strong evidence base to support doctors in offering personalised medical care for each endometriosis patient.\n\n\u201cThis substantial investment will allow researchers for the first time to build a solid understanding of endometriosis biology and pathogenesis that will lead to improved detection, management and treatment,\u201d Ford said. UNSW said AERI was only possible with the $50 million donation by the Ainsworth family. Anna and her daughter Lily Ainsworth have both experienced the debilitating effects of the disease. Lily Ainsworth has lived with endometriosis since she was 15 years old, with daily chronic pain and severe, debilitating flare-ups that could last weeks. Anna and Lily Ainsworth at UNSW. Credit: UNSW \u201cThis reality is shared with millions of people living with endo around Australia and the world. We believe this can change,\u201d Ainsworth said.\n\nLed by patriarch Len Ainsworth, founder of two of the world\u2019s biggest pokies manufacturing companies, Aristocrat Leisure and Ainsworth Game Technology, the family is building a philanthropic legacy by donating tens of millions to institutions, universities, hospitals and art galleries. Loading UNSW has an Ainsworth Building in its engineering and manufacturing facility after a $10 million donation. UNSW academics, who declined to speak on record, are among critics of institutions that accept these donations. They say the family\u2019s philanthropy should not overshadow the harms inflicted by pokies. Anti-gambling advocate Tim Costello said that when universities and other \u201cpowerful culture bearers and gatekeepers in society\u201d take Ainsworth\u2019s money, \u201cgambling reform becomes so much harder\u201d.",

        "text": "The chances of elevated inflation and stagflation (higher inflation with lower economic growth) were greater than people thought, he warned. Yet, US asset prices were high and credit spreads (the differences in yields between securities with similar maturities but different risk levels) didn\u2019t reflect the impact of a potential downturn. \u201cCredit today is a bad risk,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThe people who haven\u2019t been through a major downturn are missing the point about what can happen in credit.\u201d \u201cCredit today is a bad risk,\u201d says JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Credit: AP In a significant economic downturn, lenders will not lend to companies that are perceived as risky, or demand they pay higher interest rates. The spreads between government bond yields, the most creditworthy companies and higher-risk companies would widen. Default rates and the numbers of corporate collapses would increase. With a recession, particularly a stagflationary one, companies would face higher borrowing costs to reflect the increased risk even as their sales and profitability come under pressure.\n\nMoody\u2019s may only have been telling people what they already knew, or should have known, but its assessment of America\u2019s deteriorating public finances ought to be unnerving investors - particularly as it appears that, after last-minute concessions from Congressional leaders, Trump\u2019s \u201cOne, Big, Beautiful Bill Act\u201d is likely to be endorsed by House Republicans. Loading The US, with deficits approaching $US2 trillion ($3.1 trillion) and government debt of $US36.2 trillion already, is facing the addition of another $US3 trillion to $US4 trillion or more of debt over the next decade as a result of the tax cuts and spending plans in that bill. The bond market will have to absorb that extra issuance of debt as well as the rolling-over of maturing debt, placing upward pressure on bond yields. That would in turn flow through to borrowing costs across the economy With the Biden administration\u2019s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issuing mainly short-dated securities during Biden\u2019s presidency and her successor in the Trump administration Scott Bessent pursuing a similar strategy to keep the pressure off the yields on longer-term bonds, the market\u2019s appetite for US debt will be tested by the surge in supply from both the existing debt rolling over and the new debt flowing from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nThe ability of the bond market to soak up the volume of debt heading its way will also be challenged by the aftershocks of Trump\u2019s trade policies. Loading Tariffs are taxes on domestic consumption, whether felt directly by consumers or absorbed via lower profit margins by the importing companies. When their effects eventually show up, as they will, they will push the inflation rate up and the economic growth rate down. The increased deficits and debt could, therefore, coincide with a higher inflation rate and a slowing economy, even a Trump-induced recession. An increase in inflation and interest rates even as the economy is slowing is a recipe for something quite unpleasant. Trump, of course, doesn\u2019t believe his beloved tariffs will impact inflation or growth because he continues to believe, or at least say, that they are paid by the exporting countries.\n\nThat\u2019s despite a growing list of US companies warning that they are already experiencing cost pressures from the tariffs and will have to pass at least some of those costs onto their customers. \u201cHe (Trump) maintains the position that foreign countries absorb these tariffs,\u201d the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. Why then did Trump attack Walmart at the weekend for warning that it would have to raise its prices to reflect the impact of the tariffs? \u201cWalmart should STOP trying to blame the tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should...EAT THE TARIFFS, and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I\u2019ll be watching and so will your customers,\u201d he posted on social media.\n\nIf the tariffs are actually absorbed by foreign countries, why would Walmart or China have to \u201ceat\u201d anything? The reality is, as Walmart and other US retailers are only too aware, that they are the ones importing the goods and, even if the exporters are prepared to absorb something of the tariff impacts, they and their customers will be the ones bearing the brunt of the costs. That\u2019s been the history of trade wars. Loading Walmart\u2019s profits haven\u2019t surprised anyone and, in the very competitive US retail environment, aren\u2019t extraordinary. The group\u2019s profit margin in the first quarter of this year was about 2.7 per cent and its retail margin (earnings before interest and tax relative to sales) a modest 4.3 per cent. The world\u2019s biggest retailer is always going to post profits in the multi-billions of dollars, but it doesn\u2019t have the profit margins to absorb the tariff impacts in their entirety. Even if it did, the lower profitability would probably mean less employment and investment by the company and lower dividends and a lower share price for shareholders.",

The ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) last year granted SunCable a conditional licence to import Australian electricity from 2035. More broadly, Singapore\u2019s geography at the juncture of strategic waters is as significant now, if not more so in these unpredictable times, as it was when Sir Stamford Raffles set up shop more than 200 years ago. Playing a smart, middle-power role, Singapore maintains good relationships with both China and the US and has long been a beacon of stability among its regional neighbours, which are troubled with coups, corruption and crisis. It is a good friend to have in troubled seas. Albanese\u2019s visit is short, however. He\u2019ll spend only a couple of hours in Singapore before flying to Canberra on Tuesday night.\n\nLoading Australia and Singapore have both escaped US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff calls with a 10 per cent flat rate. Still, global trade is Singapore\u2019s heartbeat, and any disruption to the pre-Trump status quo will be keenly felt here. Wong, who is paid a salary of $2.6 million, is still little known outside his homeland. But he seems a considered and mild-mannered kind of guy. Like Australia, he did not retaliate with further tariffs on the US. And like Albanese, he ventured to say the tariffs were \u201cnot actions one does to a close friend\u201d. As a politician, he also played on the US economic threat to keep would-be straying voters in the arms of what they\u2019ve always known. The two PMs have at least several years of clear electoral air to build their personal relationship and strategies for dulling the unwieldy Trumpian knife.\n\nAlbanese and Wong were both elected on May 3. It was Wong\u2019s first election since taking the job from Lee Hsien Loong last year. With a strong showing (Wong\u2019s PAP won about 65 per cent of the popular vote), the prime ministership is now essentially his for as long as he wants to keep it and the party lets him. Wong, 52, is only Singapore\u2019s fourth prime minister in six decades of independence. Lee held the post for 20 years, long enough for Australia to cycle through seven prime ministers. Wong and Albanese at the APEC Summit in Peru in November. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Both nations\u2019 open economies are deeply wedded to international norms, but the styles of democracy are vastly different. Singapore is dominated by the undefeated PAP \u2013 the product, in part, of its good track record, expert gerrymandering, a compliant mainstream media and the party\u2019s suppression of free speech and protests. Wong has shown no inclination to mess with the winning formula. The main opposition party fielded only 26 candidates for 97 seats in parliament in the May 3 election. It won 10. Again, the PAP will be able to do as it pleases.\n\nLoading Don\u2019t expect Albanese to raise any of this. But he will point out that Australia was among the first nations to establish diplomatic ties with Singapore when it separated from Malaysia 60 years ago this year. In that time, \u201cthe little red dot\u201d has grown into a wealthy middle-power of influence, one of the great financial hubs and ports of the world. Singapore and Australia are awash in bilateral and joint multilateral agreements ranging from free trade to defence. One of them, the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative, will have at its peak 14,000 Singaporean troops training for more than four months of the year in Queensland. Another deal, the comprehensive strategic partnership, is due to be renewed this year and could be the subject of announcements on Tuesday.",
