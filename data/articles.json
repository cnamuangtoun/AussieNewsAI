        "text": "Tesla has given Elon Musk a stock grant of $US29 billion ($44.79 billion) as a reward for years of \u201ctransformative and unprecedented\" growth despite a recent foray into right-wing politics that has hurt its sales, profits and its stock price.\n\nIn giving its billionaire chief executive 96 million in restricted shares, the electric car company noted that Musk had not been paid in years because a Delaware court rejected his 2018 compensation package.\n\nThe award comes eight months after a judge revoked the 2018 pay package a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling.\n\nElon Musk will wield more control of Tesla after being handed 96 million more shares in the company. He is pictured speaking at a conservative conference earlier this year. (AP)\n\nTesla on Monday (Tuesday AEST) called the grant a \u201cfirst step, good faith\u201d way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies.\n\nMusk said recently that he needed more shares and control to stop activist shareholders from ousting him.\n\n\u201cRewarding Elon for what he has done and continues to do for Tesla is the right thing to do,\u201d the company said in a regulatory filing, citing an increase of $US735 billion in Tesla's value on the stock market since 2018.\n\nTesla shares have plunged 25 per cent this year largely due to blowback over Musk\u2019s affiliation with US President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit car makers, and from China.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $US1.39 billion to $US409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.\n\nInvestors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the US government.\n\nTesla vehicles at the company's store in Warminster, Pennsylvania, last month. (Bloomberg)\n\nThe electric vehicle maker said in the regulatory filing that Musk must first pay Tesla $US23.34 a share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package.\n\nIn December, Delaware Chancellor Kathleen St.Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package.\n\nShe found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.\n\nThe rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package.\n\nThat pay package carried a potential maximum value of about $US56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price.\n\nMusk appealed the order in March. A month later Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk\u2019s compensation as CEO.\n\nMusk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives feels Musk's stock award may alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.\n\n\u201cWe believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,\u201d Ives wrote in a client note.\n\n\u201cMusk remains Tesla\u2019s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.",

(Supplied)\n\nThe ultrasound quickly escalated into a mammogram and a biopsy when concerns were spotted.\n\nGlen told 9news.com.au she was originally informed the ultrasound would cost around $600, with a Medicare rebate of around $300.\n\nHowever, as the number of tests she needed grew, Glen wasn't informed of how much they would cost.\n\n\"When I got to the reception desk, I was given the price that I had to pay on the day, which was $1442,\" she said.\n\nUnprepared for the cost, Glen said she did not have enough money in her everyday account to pay the bill.\n\n\"I had to get my husband, who was at home, to transfer the money so I could pay,\" she said.\n\nGlen received a Medicare rebate of $125 on the day, and then a further $535 five days later, ultimately leaving her $787 out of pocket.\n\nIn Australia, women aged over 40 are entitled to free breast screening mammograms.\n\nHowever, if further diagnostic tests are needed, they often come with high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nGetting testing done in the public system is an option, but there are often long waiting times.\n\nAimee Glen underwent chemotherapy, surgery and radiation treatment for her stage two breast cancer. (Supplied)\n\nGlen said she was advised the waiting time for the public clinic in her area was around three months.\n\nA day after her tests were completed, Glen was called back in to see her GP.\n\nShe was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer.\n\nShe underwent 15 rounds of chemotherapy, before having surgery in April.\n\nA further 15 rounds of radiation therapy followed.\n\nGlen completed her cancer treatment six weeks ago and is doing well.\n\nHowever, the mother-of-two said her thoughts often still went to how expensive those initial tests were.\n\nAfter seeing comments on social media from other young mums who weren't able to afford the cost of treatment, Glen started a Change.org petition , which has attracted almost 20,000 signatures.\n\n\"It's really concerning when people are literally out there going, 'I don't know what to do because I can't afford it',\" Glen said.\n\n\"Ultimately, these tests should be free, that's my dream.\n\n\"But, at the very least, they need to be more affordable. There needs to be a bigger rebate and I think that we need payment options.\"\n\nGeelong Breast Clinic general manager Tania Armstrong said diagnostic breast tests involved the work of skilled specialists and expensive imaging equipment.\n\nArmstrong said Medicare rebates for diagnostic imaging had increased only minimally over the past 20 years and no longer reflected the true cost of the service.\n\nGeelong Breast Clinic offered flexible payment plans and compassionate billing options for those in need, she added.\n\n\"Early detection saves lives, and timely access to accurate diagnosis is critical. For this reason, many women across Victoria turn to our clinic to avoid long waitlists in the public system,\" Armstrong said.\n\n\"We fully support increased government funding for diagnostic imaging to help reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients.\n\n\"Greater funding will ensure more equitable access to vital breast health services, regardless of where a woman lives or her financial situation.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said while the government was responsible for setting Medicare rebates, medical practitioners were free to set their own fees, which may exceed the Medicare rebate, resulting in out-of-pocket costs to the patient.\n\n\"The government provides a bulk billing incentive for all diagnostic imaging services to encourage bulk billing,\" the spokesperson said.",

(ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nAs part of the $135 million, the federal government will contribute $57.5 million, with $55 million and $22.5 million to come from the SA and Tasmanian governments respectively.\n\nAccording to Nyrstar, the company employs 1,400 direct workers in Australia and supports 6,600 indirect jobs.\n\n\"Through this investment we are making sure that these facilities are going to be here for the foreseeable future,\" Trafigura CEO Richard Holtum said.\n\n\"What these two industrial sites produce \u2026 is absolutely critical to both the national security and the renewable industry, and infrastructure build-out for Australia and the western world.\"\n\nMr Holtum said the Port Pirie and Hobart sites were crucial to global supply chains and produced materials with a range of applications, including for the US military.\n\n\"The fact that this site can produce 40 per cent of all the antimony required by the United States for critical tasks such as the hardening of bullets demonstrates the vitalness of these sites \u2026 and the absolute importance of Pirie and Hobart.\"\n\nNyrstar in Hobart operates as a large zinc smelter in the state's south. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nSA Premier Peter Malinauskas said the $135 million package was \"all about setting Pirie up for a more prosperous future\".\n\n\"We know there is a journey in front of us to be able to tackle the challenges we see, particularly coming out of China, but we should be up-front and honest about them,\" he said.\n\n\"When people contemplate is this an appropriate investment on behalf of taxpayers, one also has to think about the counterfactual.\n\n\"The counterfactual would be to allow the western world to see China consolidate all of its smelting capacity, all of the world's smelting capacity, which means we don't get to participate in the \u2026 critical mineral supply chain of the future.\n\n\"That's an unacceptable risk, particularly in the current geostrategic environment.\"\n\nHow bad is Nyrstar's financial position?\n\nNyrstar Australia CEO Matt Howell told the ABC in June that its Port Pirie operation was losing tens of millions of dollars a month and needed government help within \"weeks, not months\".\n\nThe company also said at the time that its Hobart zinc smelter could not operate independently of Port Pirie if the latter were to go under.\n\nIn March, Nyrstar's global parent company, Trafigura, said its Australian operations were \"uneconomical\", with Trafigura's CEO describing Nyrstar Australia as an \"uncompetitive asset\" that \"shouldn't be in fully private hands\".\n\nThe company says it employs 1,400 people directly and supports 6,600 indirect jobs. (ABC News: Trent Murphy)\n\nWhy is Nyrstar in this position?\n\nThe company blames \"market distortion\" from China for its problems.\n\nChina has, according to Nyrstar, distorted the metals market by subsidising Chinese companies to purchase Australian raw materials at prices Australian smelters cannot afford.\n\nChina then subsidises the processing of those materials into metals while also placing export controls over the finished product, the company has previously said.\n\nThe issue has also put a cloud over the future of the Mount Isa copper smelter and Townsville copper refinery in Queensland.\n\n\"It's not just impacting South Australia or Australia, it's affecting everybody,\" Rebecca Knol, CEO of the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy, told ABC Radio Adelaide.\n\n\"Port Pirie require mineral concentrate to produce lead, and its operation in Hobart needs concentrate to produce Zinc.\n\n\"This is procured within Australia from Australian mining operations, however China has been strategically procuring concentrate from these Australian operations on long-term contracts at a premium.\n\n\"Which has made it very difficult for the likes of Nyrstar to obtain \u2026 feedstock, or the concentrate, at a price that makes their manufacturing competitive.\"",

It has followed that triumph with run where almost everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong.\n\nA slew of off-field issues, including legal issues for Clayton Oliver and Joel Smith, contributed to rumours of a toxic culture within the club in the years since the stirring comeback to beat the Western Bulldogs and win the Demons' first premiership since 1964.\n\nIt prompted Goodwin in 2023 to proclaim \"I do not use illicit drugs\" in response to unsubstantiated rumours, as it was reported the AFL met with Melbourne chief executive Glen Bartlett to discuss Goodwin's behaviour at a gathering with his players in a Mornington Peninsula pub at the start of 2021.\n\nGoodwin told SEN \"there was nothing in it\" and said the allegations negatively affected his reputation and took a toll on him and his family.\n\n\"Do I enjoy having a beer and a punt and a glass of wine with mates? Of course I do. I'm a pretty straightforward type of guy, but I live my life in a way that is a dedicated approach to my career and my football club and my family,\" he said.\n\n\"The rumours have to stop. It's gone way out of control from a boardroom battle into court documents into republication and rehashing of a story over and over again to the extent where it's become a 'fact', which is just not fair. And it's gone from a rumour, to an allegation, to a 'fact' and it has got to stop.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

It's impossible,\" she said.\n\n\"If [the government] want us off gas, there's no point spending the money to switch to bottled gas, to then pay more again to switch to electric eventually.\n\n\" This could crush so many households.

As we enter the final week, there are a few things to know about gas, how much of it we use, and what role it plays in our power bills.\n\n\"If Solstice is cutting us off, the government needs to step in and support these 10 rural communities because we're already struggling with the cost of living,\" Ms Edgar said.\n\nA Solstice Energy spokesperson said the service was no longer viable for customers or the business due to costs.\n\n\"We have now had to implement a further price rise for customers, so we want to find a better option for them,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Rather than continuing to raise prices in the future, we are instead supporting our customers [to] switch to bottled LPG or electricity and then closing the CNG networks by the end of 2026.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said customers who chose to shift to electric appliances could be financially assisted to do so.\n\nSolstice Energy has also committed to funding and arranging ways for existing gas appliances in the affected towns to use bottled Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nA Victorian government spokesperson said several conversations had been held with Solstice Energy, and the company would provide up-front payments to help affected customers.\n\n\"For those switching to electricity, we're providing up to thousands in discounts through Solar Homes and the [Victorian Energy Upgrades],\" the spokesperson said.\n\nVic Cresp is a Marong resident and a member of the Marong Community Action Group. (ABC Central Victoria: Anna McGuinness)\n\nTime to convert 'just insane'\n\nFellow Marong resident and Electrify Marong Committee member Vic Cresp said the announcement came as a shock.\n\n\"The idea is to convince people that gas was too expensive and the cheaper alternative is electricity, especially if you can get solar, and now batteries are in the equation too,\" he said.\n\n\" The better option now is to go electric, but with the economic climate and people struggling, I don't know how they're going to afford it. \"\n\nThe Robinvale Accommodation Village can have upwards of 100 patrons during peak season. (Supplied: Lane Li)\n\nLane Li, who runs an accommodation village and a popular Asian restaurant at Robinvale in north-west Victoria, said he was convinced to convert the village's hot water services and stovetops from LPG to compressed natural gas in 2021.\n\n\"If we knew we would only have the service for five years, we wouldn't have done it,\" he said.\n\n\"If they close the compressed gas service, that means we'll have to convert it back to the bottled one, which is going to be a pain for our business.\"\n\nLane Li is concerned about how he will store large LPG bottles at his restaurant. (Supplied: Lane Li)\n\nMr Li said electric hot water services were not as reliable or efficient as gas, so he would likely opt for LPG, despite concerns about the supply limitations of bottles.\n\n\"We're big gas users in the area and with bottled gas \u2026 it's going to be very hard,\" he said.\n\n\" In peak season we have 100 people staying at our accommodation village \u2026 and if we don't time [deliveries] well, basically, we'll run out of gas. \"\n\nEnvironment Victoria senior climate and energy advisor Kat Lucas-Healey said it was essential communities were in a good position to make the switch.\n\n\"The government's recent decisions to improve minimum rental standards and begin the systematic introduction of heat pump water heaters will make sure that households aren't stuck paying exorbitant gas bills, or going cold to avoid them,\" Dr Lucas-Healey said.\n\n\"Victorian home owners who haven't yet thought about how they want to go electric should look into the savings they're missing out on and start making a plan.\"",

        "text": "As Australia's truffle industry continues to grow, a truffiere on the New South Wales Central Tablelands has become the first in the country to be certified free of a banned residual chemical.\n\nJapan rejected several shipments of truffles from Australia in 2023 due to detections of organochlorine (OC) over the country's maximum residue limits.\n\nOC is a chemical that has been banned in Australia since the 1990s and is typically found in various pesticides.\n\nJapan, Australia's second-largest export market for truffles, has a three-strikes rule whereby if there are three detections of OC, the entire Australian industry would be banned from exporting truffles to their country.\n\nDogs help sniff out truffles, while producers get on their hands and knees to check exactly where to dig. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nIn response to the first detection, the Australian Truffle Industry Association (ATIA) introduced the 2025 National Soils Testing Protocol, certifying truffieres were free from OC.\n\nThe testing is part of a recently introduced broader program of best practice called TruffleCare.\n\nRedground Australia, an Oberon-based truffiere \u2014 otherwise simply known as a truffle grower \u2014 has been issued the first certificate of compliance under ATIA's National Soils Testing Protocol for Residues of Persistent Chemicals.\n\n\"It means our customers, our clientele, can be assured that the product that they are receiving, whether it's in Australia or overseas, is clean and free of residues,\" said the owner and managing director of Redground Australia, Jill O'Grady.\n\nJill O'Grady is the owner and managing director of Redground Australia. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nWhile Ms O'Grady said it was a lengthy process to secure the certificate \u2014 including getting accredited soil tests and looking at where their trees had come from \u2014 it was a vital step for industry.\n\n\" It's going to lift the standards of truffle production in Australia to the highest level, where it's quality, maturity, ripeness, grading, free of defects, free of chemicals, everything. \"\n\nATIA vice-president Noel Fitzpatrick said the certification gave exporters confidence in their truffles.\n\n\"This is going to become more and more important over time as we build up export markets, but also the farms within Australia,\" he said.\n\nDemand for Australian truffles\n\nTruffles are a subterranean fruit of fungi growing on the roots of host trees and are often used as a flavour enhancer on top of savoury dishes.\n\nDespite only beginning to market truffles 25 years ago, Australia is the fourth-largest producer in the world, growing an estimated 20 tonnes of truffles per year.\n\nJill O'Grady in the kitchen of Redground Australia in Oberon. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nThis has grown significantly over the past few decades, with production projected to double or triple within the next 10 years.\n\nMr Fitzpatrick said creating the TruffleCare program was vital to ensuring each Australian truffle business produced a high-level product.\n\n\"We're always looking at quality assurance in the industry so we can maintain our standing on the global market and make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to produce the best quality that we can to maintain those markets,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian truffle industry is estimated to have a gross value of $40 million per year and is made up of about 400 growers.\n\nJill O'Grady and her truffle dog, Sarge. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nSeventy per cent of growers are in the southern forests region of south-west Western Australia, according to Agrifutures.\n\nTruffles in general prefer warm summers and cold winters, with some incidence of frost and deep, well-draining and high pH soils.\n\nBecause of this, most Australian truffieres generally need to modify soils.\n\nWhat is organochlorine?\n\nDecades ago, farmers would use insecticides such as Dieldrin and DDT to kill and deter pests in the soil from eating their crops.\n\nThese were all part of the OC (organochlorine) family, which Australia banned in the 1990s.\n\nThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said OCs generally resisted degradation by chemical, physical or biological means, meaning they were toxic to humans and other animals.\n\nRedground Australia was the first business to be issued a certificate of compliance under ATIA. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nOCs are said to have serious short and long-term impacts at low concentrations, as well as non-lethal effects such as damage to the immune and reproductive systems.\n\nDespite being banned for decades, the chemical has a residual effect, potentially taking hundreds of years to deplete from the soil.",

(ABC News: Simon Beardsell)\n\nThe community push for a nurse has been going on for a decade, with the first glimmer of hope given ahead of last October's ACT election.\n\nIt was then that Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith made an election commitment to expand the movement disorder centre within the Brindabella Day Service, including providing a specialist Parkinson's nurse who would work in the community.\n\nFor Marcia Kimball, who is the chair of Parkinson's ACT, it felt like the hard advocacy work was finally paying off.\n\nBut now, six months on from the election, she is frustrated the more than 3,000 Canberrans living with the disease are still waiting.\n\n\"The volunteers with Parkinson's ACT have been pushing for this for at least 10 years,\" Ms Kimball said.\n\n\"It's very frustrating and disappointing for our community that we're still waiting.\"\n\nMs Kimball has been campaigning for a dedicated Parkinson's nurse position for the ACT for years. (ABC News: Simon Beardsell)\n\nMs Kimball said the ACT was now the only jurisdiction in Australia where people with Parkinson's can't access a specialist nurse at home through the public health system.\n\n\"They have five nurses in South Australia and South Australia is probably three times our population,\" she said.\n\n\"All we're asking for is one, which we don't believe is even enough \u2014 it's not a lot of money in the scheme of things.\"\n\nThe challenge of in-home care\n\nMs Kimball's husband John was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2008 after showing signs of rigidity, a slight tremor, apathy, and an overall slowing down.\n\nHe has been in full-time residential aged care since 2022.\n\nMs Kimball can't help but wonder how much longer her husband could have remained in the family home had he had access to home visits from a specialist nurse.\n\n\"It can really help keep people in the home \u2014 nurses can advise on medication, symptoms management, counselling for family and carers, referral pathways in the health system,\" she said.\n\n\"With Parkinson's, there's a lack of mobility so it can be really hard on carers and the people living with the disease to go out to clinics.\n\n\"So, having someone come to you really is invaluable.\"\n\nMs Kimball has been motivated by her husband John's experience living with Parkinson's. (ABC News: Simon Beardsell)\n\nNo timeline on start-date\n\nMs Stephen-Smith said she was still committed to delivering on her election promise.\n\n\"Absolutely, we are establishing a Parkinson's nurse through the Brindabella Day Service at the University of Canberra Hospital and work is underway to do that,\" she said.\n\nBut when pressed for a timeline, the minister failed to provide one.\n\n\"Canberra Health Services is working to set up that model to ensure that we get it right and that means working with the community as well and recruiting the advance practice nurse to undertake that work,\" she said.\n\nACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith says the specialist nurse will operate out of the Brindabella Day Service. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nMs Miragaya said she can't help but feel \"discriminated against\" by the lack of action.\n\n\"These are my people now \u2014 I'm a Parky \u2014 so to keep me well at home, I may need some additional supports and that may mean I need a nurse to come and assess my home, my safety, my ability to cook or clean or dress or shower,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever I need, it should be readily available for me to access, but not if you've got Parkinson's.\"",

        "text": "Even without that next tranche of capacity, OPEC+\u2019s increase in output this year will hit a market that is expected to be over-supplied by as much as 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of this year The current Brent oil price is about $US68 a barrel but analysts from major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have forecast oil prices of around $US60 a barrel by the end of the year. The shift in OPEC+ strategy could be regarded as self-destructive. The key Middle Eastern producers have very low production costs (the Saudi\u2019s are less than $US15 a barrel) but need prices ranging from about $US65 a barrel (United Arab Emirates) to $US85 a barrel (Saudi Arabia) to balance their budgets. Flooding the market with more oil will almost inevitably push prices down. Having accepted reality, however, the cartel is now trying, again, to implement a strategy it has attempted twice before \u2013 first between 2014 and 2016 and then in 2020 \u2013 where it tried to take market share away from the US shale producers by driving the price below their production costs.\n\nIt underestimated the dynamic nature of the shale producers who, after an initial drop in their production, cut their costs and increased their productivity at a startling rate. Will OPEC+ be any more successful this time? Loading The US producers are more returns-focused than during those earlier episodes and, with some of the major basins\u2019 reserves depleting, are more likely to respond to a lower oil price by mothballing their wells. Already, with West Texas Intermediate prices at around $US66 a barrel, there are about 46 fewer rigs operating onshore in the US than a year ago. Trump might want US companies to \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d but a recent Dallas Federal Reserve Bank survey shows most would reduce their drilling if the US price fell towards $US60 a barrel. Breakeven costs for US producers average around the mid-$US60 dollars a barrel.\n\nThere could be something of a safety valve for both the core OPEC producers and the US shale oil sector. This Friday is the deadline Trump has set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, with Trump threatening secondary tariffs of 100 per cent on Russia\u2019s oil customers if it doesn\u2019t comply. India, who along with China and Turkey has been one of the major buyers of Russian oil during the conflict, has been specifically targeted by Trump. Russia\u2019s new production target will be 9.45 million barrels a day next month. Any material reduction its oil sales would create space for the increased production of other OPEC+ members and take some of the pressure off oil prices. Trump wants the US companies to \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d but a recent Dallas Federal Reserve Bank survey indicates most would reduce their drilling if the US price fell towards $US60 a barrel. Credit: Bloomberg Absent the withdrawal of Russian supply, even if Russia is eventually able to find a workaround (as it has throughout the war in Ukraine and the sanctions regime the G7 has imposed), the outlook for demand in the near term isn\u2019t great.\n\nChina\u2019s economy has been spluttering and is further threatened by Trump\u2019s trade wars. The US economy has weakened sharply because of, initially, the uncertainty Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies and his assault on government agencies have created and now the reality and increasing economic impacts of his tariffs. The global economy will slow because of Trump\u2019s assault on global trade. Some of the faster-growing economies, and those most dependent on imported energy \u2013 the Asian, South American and African developing economies \u2013 are, perversely, among those facing the most punitive tariffs. Having accepted reality, OPEC+ is now opening the spigots. While lower oil prices might help keep a lid on inflation rates, particularly the US inflation rate, and provide some offset for those import-dependent economies from the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the trade-off will be reduced economic growth. The longer-term outlook for oil is clouded.\n\nOPEC believes demand, fuelled by developing economies, will continue to grow through to 2050, rising from just over 100 million barrels a day to 123 million. The International Energy Agency believes demand, impacted by electric vehicles and electrification more widely, will peak at about 105 million barrels a day in 2030. Loading While the long-term outcome matters for the members of the cartel, who are still overly reliant on oil revenue despite increasingly urgent attempts to diversify their economies, it\u2019s the near-term outlook for oil prices that matters for an increasingly messy and threatened global economy. It also matters for Trump\u2019s economic strategy, as articulated by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent\u2019s \u201c3-3-3\u201d strategy has three major components. He aims to reduce the federal deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, raise GDP growth to 3 per cent per year, and add 3 million barrels per day of domestic oil production.",

Maintain a healthy weight Being overweight or obese indicates an excess of white adipose tissue. This kind of tissue can increase the risk of heart disease because it stores fat cells, known as adipocytes, which release substances that contribute to inflammation. In studies, we\u2019ve seen that glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) drugs can reduce inflammation with weight loss, and a significant reduction of heart attacks and strokes among high-risk patients treated for obesity. Lean body weight also helps protect against atrial fibrillation, the most common heart rhythm abnormality. Loading\n\n4. Know and avoid metabolic syndrome and prediabetes Tied into obesity, in part, is the problem of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Two out of three people with obesity have this syndrome, which is defined as having three out of five features: high fasting blood glucose, high fasting triglycerides, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and central adiposity (waist circumference of more than 40 inches [101cm] in men, 35 inches [89cm] in women). Metabolic syndrome is also present in a high proportion of people without obesity, about 50 million Americans. Prediabetes often overlaps with it. Prediabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1c (a measure of how much glucose is stuck to your red blood cells) between 5.7 and 6.4 per cent, or a fasting glucose between 100 and 125 milligrams per decilitre. Both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes carry an increased risk of heart disease and can be prevented \u2013 and countered \u2013 by weight loss, exercise and an optimal diet. As the glucagon-like peptide drug family moves to pills and less expense in the future, these medications may prove helpful for reducing risk in people with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. For those with Type 2 diabetes, the goal is optimising glucose management and maximal attention to lifestyle factors.\n\n5. Keep your blood pressure in a healthy range Hypertension is an important risk factor for heart disease and is exceptionally common as we age. The optimal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower. But with ageing, there is often an elevation of systolic blood pressure to about 130 mm Hg, related to stiffening of arteries. While common, it is still considered elevated. Ideally, everyone should monitor their blood pressure with a home device to make sure they haven\u2019t developed hypertension. A mild abnormality of blood pressure will typically improve with lifestyle changes, but more substantial elevations will probably require medications. Keeping an eye on blood pressure levels will help flag problems early. Credit: Getty Images 6. Find out your genetic risk\n\nWe now have the means of determining your genetic risk of coronary artery disease with what is known as a polygenic risk score, derived from a gene chip. The term polygenic refers to hundreds of DNA variants in the genome that are linked to risk of heart disease. This is very different from a family history because we\u2019re a product of both our mother\u2019s and father\u2019s genomes, and the way the DNA variants come together in each of us can vary considerably for combinations of variants. Loading That means you could have high or low risk for heart disease that is different from your familial pattern. People with a high polygenic risk score benefit the most from medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins. A polygenic risk score can be obtained from a number of commercial companies, though it isn\u2019t typically covered by insurance. I don\u2019t recommend getting a calcium score of your coronary arteries via a computed tomography (CT) scan. This test is overused and often induces overwhelming anxiety in patients with a high calcium score but without symptoms or bona fide risk. If you have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, such as chest discomfort with exercise, then a CT angiogram may be helpful to map the coronary arteries. It is much more informative than a calcium score. 7. Check your blood lipids\n\nThe main lipid abnormality that requires attention is low-density cholesterol (LDL), which is often high and for people with increased risk of heart disease should certainly be addressed. While lifestyle improvements can help, significant elevation typically requires medications such as a statin; ezetimibe; bempedoic acid; or injectables such as evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent) or inclisiran (Leqvio). The higher the risk, the more aggressive LDL lowering may be considered. It should be noted that the use of potent statins, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, especially at high doses, is linked to inducing glucose intolerance and risk of Type 2 diabetes. While this is not a common side effect, it requires attention since it is often missed from lack of awareness. A low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol often responds to weight loss and exercise. We used to think that high HDL was indicative of \u201cgood cholesterol,\u201d but more recent evidence suggests that is not the case and it may reflect increased risk when very high. To get a comprehensive assessment of risk via your blood lipids, it\u2019s important to get the apolipoprotein B (apoB) test at least once because about 20 per cent of people have normal LDL and a high apoB. Like low HDL, high fasting triglycerides may indicate insulin resistance as part of the metabolic syndrome and will often respond to lifestyle factors.\n\nThe lipoprotein known as Lp(a) should also be assessed at least once because it indicates risk when elevated. The good news is scientists are on the cusp of finally having medications to lower it, with five different drugs in late-stage clinical trials. 8. Reduce exposure to environmental pollutants In recent years, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the substantial pro-inflammatory effects of air pollution, microplastics and forever chemicals, all of which have been linked to a higher risk of heart disease. In one study, microplastics or nanoplastics in the artery wall were found in about 60 per cent of more than 300 people. Researchers found a vicious inflammatory response around the plastics, and a four- to fivefold risk of heart attacks or strokes during three years of follow-up. While we need policy changes to address these toxic substances in the environment, risk can be reduced by paying attention to air and water quality using filtration or purification devices, less use of plastic water bottles and plastic storage, and, in general, being much more aware and wary of our pervasive use of plastics. Reduce your exposure to microplastics by cutting back on the use of plastic bottles. Credit: Shutterstock\n\n9. Don\u2019t smoke By this point, it should be well known that cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor for coronary artery disease and should be completely avoided. 10. Get good sleep Although we tend to connect sleep health with brain and cognitive function, there\u2019s evidence that sleep regularity and quality are associated with less risk of heart disease. Regularity means adhering to a routine schedule as much as possible, and its benefit may be due to our body\u2019s preference for maintaining its circadian rhythm. Sleep quality \u2013 meaning with fewer interruptions \u2013 and maximal deep sleep can be tracked with smartwatches, fitness bands, rings or mattress sensors. Sleep apnoea, when breathing stops and starts during sleep, is fairly common and often unsuspected. So if you\u2019re having trouble sleeping or you snore loudly, talk to your doctor about ruling out the condition. Testing for sleep apnoea can involve checking for good oxygen saturation throughout one\u2019s sleep. That can be done through a sleep study or at home using rings or smartwatches that include oxygen saturation in their sensors and body movement algorithms that pick up disturbed breathing.",

        "text": "For many Australians, fertility treatment is a private decision made with clinical support. But for women from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, starting a family can come with a heavy burden of silence and, in some cases, deep shame.\n\n\n\n\n\nRhea Abraham knows this weight intimately.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Indian background and raised with strong cultural and faith traditions, Rhea found herself navigating not only the physical and emotional challenges of fertility treatment but also the layered expectations of family and community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I first met my then-husband, he made it very clear he wanted to be a father,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember thinking on our first date that, if I wanted to be with him, I would have to become a mother. That was a thought so foreign to me at that stage in my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple's joy at falling pregnant quickly turned to heartbreak when their daughter June, diagnosed with a fatal condition, was lost at 14 weeks.\n\n\n\nRhea Abraham describes herself as a bereaved mother and has turned her grief into advocacy for CALD women struggling with fertility and pregnancy loss. Source: Supplied In the years that followed, Rhea experienced multiple miscarriages and underwent IVF.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe even considered international surrogacy in her longing to become a mother and fulfil her partner's dream of fatherhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't just the physical and emotional toll of fertility treatment that Rhea struggled with; it was also the stigma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I wasn't prepared for was the religious and cultural language around women being 'blessed' with children,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Language that, unfortunately and unintentionally, made me feel that I was cursed because I couldn\u2019t bear them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The stigma attached to not being able to bear a child was insurmountable.\"\n\n\n\nA need for better care\n\nAccording to Karina Bosetti, director of nursing at Connect IVF, Rhea's story is not uncommon.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says stigma around fertility runs deep in many migrant communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It may be taboo or not spoken about in their community, and they may not know how to address their concerns,\" Bosetti said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Patients in some migrant communities are less likely to engage in donor services, which may lead these patients to be unable to start their families and end up childless. It can also lead to marriage breakdown in some migrant couples as the pressure to start a family is forced upon them.\"\n\n\n\nWith fertility already a complex medical and emotional journey, for some migrant women, these added cultural layers delay the decision to seek help \u2014 and with fertility, timing is crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taking longer to seek help, then delaying treatment, always runs the risk of being unsuccessful with treatment,\" Bosetti said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It may delay them seeking the treatment in the first place or asking the questions of their GPs due to cultural biases. It can leave these couples with no information or guidance to start their fertility treatment. It also means that some couples can have significant underlying medical conditions affecting their fertility that they never seek treatment for, or are never suggested the right treatment.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s IVF success rate has steadily improved\n\nAccording to research from UNSW, in 2021, 37.1 per cent of women who completed their first full cycle of assisted reproductive technology had a baby, with a cumulative live birth rate of more than 53 per cent after three cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same year, more than 20,000 babies were born from IVF treatment, accounting for one in every 18 babies born in Australia.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Melanie had to reimagine her family when she discovered there were no Indigenous sperm donors\n\nBut despite these advances, national data sets like the Australian and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database do not currently report on IVF outcomes by migrant background.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis leaves a significant evidence gap when it comes to understanding who is accessing fertility treatment and who is missing out.\n\n\n\nMore barriers for migrant women\n\nAt the same time, migrant women are overrepresented in certain pregnancy complications.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen born in Southern and Central Asia, South-East Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and North-East Asia were between 1.4 and 2.2 times as likely to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are also more likely to experience barriers to timely antenatal care.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Migrant and Refugee Maternal and Perinatal Health, \"over one-third of all birthing people in Australia are migrants, and many face additional risks during pregnancy due to language barriers, health system inaccessibility, and stigma around reproductive health\".\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific director at Connect IVF, Lauren Hiser, says clinics have a role to play in bridging that gap.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to provide more culturally directed information for all migrant communities, also addressing specific concerns,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important to bring culturally sensitive conversation to the forefront and give communities a voice and place to ask questions, to know what is acceptable within their cultural limitations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Rhea, the experience has shaped her into an advocate for better grief literacy in CALD communities, founding Dark Horse International, a media company dedicated to amplifying the voices of CALD communities, domestic and family violence survivors and child safety advocates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I live vicariously now as a proud, typical Indian aunty,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I am blessed with are friends and family who remember my baby girl June, who will always live on in my heart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGriefline provides confidential support on 1300 845 745 and via griefline.org.au\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace Multicultural Mental Health supports people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\n\n\n\n",

And of course we are not out of the woods yet, because after the rain of course comes the flooding, and so we do have some areas that we are expecting to have major flooding over today and potentially into tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, the state's SES has responded to more than 3600 calls for assistance and responded to 2092 incidents, including 25 flood rescues.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Productivity Commission has outlined a series of steps to boost Australia's productivity by tackling climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe independent government advisory body has released the second of five reports ahead of the federal government's summit later this month, aimed at lifting lagging productivity rates and boost economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended measures to achieve the net zero transition include a shift to market-based incentives in the electricity sector which could replace the Renewable Energy Target and the Capacity Investment Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie welcomed the report, saying its analysis on the substantial risks to the Australian economy from climate damage comes at the perfect time, as the federal government considers its emission reduction target for 2035.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Tourism Minister Don Farrell has launched a new $130 million Tourism Australia campaign with organisation mascot, Ruby the Roo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign builds on the $255 million Come and Say G'day campaign, which was launched in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will include new TV and online advertisements featuring Ruby the Roo with celebrities from China, the US, UK, India and Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was launched in part, during Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Farrell says the sector is crucial for the Australian economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tourism is a very important part of our economy, about 340,000 businesses around this country rely on the tourism industry and they employ about 700,000 people.

        "text": "The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has reached its highest full-time personnel levels in 15 years as the federal government maintains \"ambitions to grow\" the number of recruits \u2014 though it still fell short of its target for that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nData released on Monday shows the ADF's permanent workforce grew by 1,868 over the 2024\u201325 financial year, bringing the total number of full-time personnel to 61,189.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the growth, the defence force remains behind on its ambitious target to increase the permanent headcount to at least 69,000 by the early 2030s, a benchmark set by the Albanese government in response to escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles described the recruitment drive as \"great news for the nation\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But as good as that news is, our challenge is not just about keeping the defence force at the numbers that we're at, as important as it is to steady the ship, we have ambitions to grow the defence force through the back-end of this decade and into the 2030s,\" he said on Monday.\n\n\n\n\"We know there is a lot more to do,\" Marles said.\n\n\n\nEnrolments and retention rates are up\n\nWhile enrolments have risen significantly, and well ahead of the government's budget forecast of 59,373, the number has still fallen short of its annual recruitment target by approximately 1,000 members.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a positive sign for retention, the number of personnel leaving the service dropped by 7.9 per cent, marking the lowest exit rate in a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 75,000 people applied to join up over 2024-25, but enlistments totalled just 7,059, mostly due to stringent recruitment standards and long processing times.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh said the application process period has decreased from \"over a year\" down to an average of some 260 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Importantly for our critical roles, those that we need to be accelerating, we're now getting that process down to around 150 days, and we'll keep working to make that work faster,\" he said on Monday.\n\n\n\nKeogh also acknowledged some eligibility requirements were relaxed in 2024, allowing more people to apply for the ADF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've done things like changing eligibility criteria, making sure that our policies weren't just knocking people out of the system for no really valid reason,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the 21st century, it was in no way appropriate that just because someone had endometriosis that they could not be a member of our defence force or that because they'd had acne or a significant broken bone in their past.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ADF also opened up to permanent residents from New Zealand last year, and to permanent residents from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States from the start of this year.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Government clarifies defence plans after foreign recruitment confusion\n\nKeogh estimated there were over 500 current applications from these countries, as the government looks to increase its \"most important capability\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that we've got terribly difficult geo-strategic circumstances that we face,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we've been getting about over the last three years is making sure that we deliver on that increase in our most important capability. That is our people.\"\n\n\n\nOver 300 different roles\n\nThe ADF is recruiting personnel for over 300 different types of roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not just the things that people think about in terms of front-line army infantry or fighter pilots, but the diesel mechanics, the cyber operators, the new intake that we'll be bringing on of space operators, those people that are going to be engaged in our nuclear propelled submarine force,\" Keogh said.\n\n\n\nAndrew Carr, an associate professor at the Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre, said the ADF also has growing responsibilities domestically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got a number of demands upon the ADF and a lot more of those are at home in terms of natural disasters, and supporting local governments through those crises,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are starting to see a lot more of these happening at the same time. And the scale of potential problems means you need a lot more people.\"\n\n\n\nA 'new era' for the ADF\n\nCarr said the ADF is navigating a \"new era\" as it adapts to contemporary challenges and expectations amid an \"identity challenge\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the past few decades, the ADF has been a very small but very elite professional force, that's been its identity and what it's been required to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But now we are transitioning to a world where we need the ADF to be large, and it's not going to be as elite. And that's a real identity challenge for the ADF.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why young people are turning away from military service in record numbers\n\nCarr said the growing numbers aren't a reflection of reduced standards but rather an adaptation to a \"new era\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully, conflict in our region is decades away if it ever were to come, and the effort to deter regional tensions \u2014 whether that's with China or another neighbour \u2014 will be driven by people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining strong relationships, particularly with the US and UK, will also be critical to stability in the Pacific, he said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Even without that next tranche of capacity, OPEC+\u2019s increase in output this year will hit a market that is expected to be over-supplied by as much as 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of this year The current Brent oil price is about $US68 a barrel but analysts from major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have forecast oil prices of around $US60 a barrel by the end of the year. The shift in OPEC+ strategy could be regarded as self-destructive. The key Middle Eastern producers have very low production costs (the Saudi\u2019s are less than $US15 a barrel) but need prices ranging from about $US65 a barrel (United Arab Emirates) to $US85 a barrel (Saudi Arabia) to balance their budgets. Flooding the market with more oil will almost inevitably push prices down. Having accepted reality, however, the cartel is now trying, again, to implement a strategy it has attempted twice before \u2013 first between 2014 and 2016 and then in 2020 \u2013 where it tried to take market share away from the US shale producers by driving the price below their production costs.\n\nIt underestimated the dynamic nature of the shale producers who, after an initial drop in their production, cut their costs and increased their productivity at a startling rate. Will OPEC+ be any more successful this time? Loading The US producers are more returns-focused than during those earlier episodes and, with some of the major basins\u2019 reserves depleting, are more likely to respond to a lower oil price by mothballing their wells. Already, with West Texas Intermediate prices at around $US66 a barrel, there are about 46 fewer rigs operating onshore in the US than a year ago. Trump might want US companies to \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d but a recent Dallas Federal Reserve Bank survey shows most would reduce their drilling if the US price fell towards $US60 a barrel. Breakeven costs for US producers average around the mid-$US60 dollars a barrel.\n\nThere could be something of a safety valve for both the core OPEC producers and the US shale oil sector. This Friday is the deadline Trump has set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, with Trump threatening secondary tariffs of 100 per cent on Russia\u2019s oil customers if it doesn\u2019t comply. India, who along with China and Turkey has been one of the major buyers of Russian oil during the conflict, has been specifically targeted by Trump. Russia\u2019s new production target will be 9.45 million barrels a day next month. Any material reduction its oil sales would create space for the increased production of other OPEC+ members and take some of the pressure off oil prices. Trump wants the US companies to \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d but a recent Dallas Federal Reserve Bank survey indicates most would reduce their drilling if the US price fell towards $US60 a barrel. Credit: Bloomberg Absent the withdrawal of Russian supply, even if Russia is eventually able to find a workaround (as it has throughout the war in Ukraine and the sanctions regime the G7 has imposed), the outlook for demand in the near term isn\u2019t great.\n\nChina\u2019s economy has been spluttering and is further threatened by Trump\u2019s trade wars. The US economy has weakened sharply because of, initially, the uncertainty Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies and his assault on government agencies have created and now the reality and increasing economic impacts of his tariffs. The global economy will slow because of Trump\u2019s assault on global trade. Some of the faster-growing economies, and those most dependent on imported energy \u2013 the Asian, South American and African developing economies \u2013 are, perversely, among those facing the most punitive tariffs. Having accepted reality, OPEC+ is now opening the spigots. While lower oil prices might help keep a lid on inflation rates, particularly the US inflation rate, and provide some offset for those import-dependent economies from the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the trade-off will be reduced economic growth. The longer-term outlook for oil is clouded.\n\nOPEC believes demand, fuelled by developing economies, will continue to grow through to 2050, rising from just over 100 million barrels a day to 123 million. The International Energy Agency believes demand, impacted by electric vehicles and electrification more widely, will peak at about 105 million barrels a day in 2030. Loading While the long-term outcome matters for the members of the cartel, who are still overly reliant on oil revenue despite increasingly urgent attempts to diversify their economies, it\u2019s the near-term outlook for oil prices that matters for an increasingly messy and threatened global economy. It also matters for Trump\u2019s economic strategy, as articulated by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent\u2019s \u201c3-3-3\u201d strategy has three major components. He aims to reduce the federal deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, raise GDP growth to 3 per cent per year, and add 3 million barrels per day of domestic oil production.",

Maintain a healthy weight Being overweight or obese indicates an excess of white adipose tissue. This kind of tissue can increase the risk of heart disease because it stores fat cells, known as adipocytes, which release substances that contribute to inflammation. In studies, we\u2019ve seen that glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) drugs can reduce inflammation with weight loss, and a significant reduction of heart attacks and strokes among high-risk patients treated for obesity. Lean body weight also helps protect against atrial fibrillation, the most common heart rhythm abnormality. Loading\n\n4. Know and avoid metabolic syndrome and prediabetes Tied into obesity, in part, is the problem of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Two out of three people with obesity have this syndrome, which is defined as having three out of five features: high fasting blood glucose, high fasting triglycerides, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and central adiposity (waist circumference of more than 40 inches [101cm] in men, 35 inches [89cm] in women). Metabolic syndrome is also present in a high proportion of people without obesity, about 50 million Americans. Prediabetes often overlaps with it. Prediabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1c (a measure of how much glucose is stuck to your red blood cells) between 5.7 and 6.4 per cent, or a fasting glucose between 100 and 125 milligrams per decilitre. Both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes carry an increased risk of heart disease and can be prevented \u2013 and countered \u2013 by weight loss, exercise and an optimal diet. As the glucagon-like peptide drug family moves to pills and less expense in the future, these medications may prove helpful for reducing risk in people with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. For those with Type 2 diabetes, the goal is optimising glucose management and maximal attention to lifestyle factors.\n\n5. Keep your blood pressure in a healthy range Hypertension is an important risk factor for heart disease and is exceptionally common as we age. The optimal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower. But with ageing, there is often an elevation of systolic blood pressure to about 130 mm Hg, related to stiffening of arteries. While common, it is still considered elevated. Ideally, everyone should monitor their blood pressure with a home device to make sure they haven\u2019t developed hypertension. A mild abnormality of blood pressure will typically improve with lifestyle changes, but more substantial elevations will probably require medications. Keeping an eye on blood pressure levels will help flag problems early. Credit: Getty Images 6. Find out your genetic risk\n\nWe now have the means of determining your genetic risk of coronary artery disease with what is known as a polygenic risk score, derived from a gene chip. The term polygenic refers to hundreds of DNA variants in the genome that are linked to risk of heart disease. This is very different from a family history because we\u2019re a product of both our mother\u2019s and father\u2019s genomes, and the way the DNA variants come together in each of us can vary considerably for combinations of variants. Loading That means you could have high or low risk for heart disease that is different from your familial pattern. People with a high polygenic risk score benefit the most from medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins. A polygenic risk score can be obtained from a number of commercial companies, though it isn\u2019t typically covered by insurance. I don\u2019t recommend getting a calcium score of your coronary arteries via a computed tomography (CT) scan. This test is overused and often induces overwhelming anxiety in patients with a high calcium score but without symptoms or bona fide risk. If you have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, such as chest discomfort with exercise, then a CT angiogram may be helpful to map the coronary arteries. It is much more informative than a calcium score. 7. Check your blood lipids\n\nThe main lipid abnormality that requires attention is low-density cholesterol (LDL), which is often high and for people with increased risk of heart disease should certainly be addressed. While lifestyle improvements can help, significant elevation typically requires medications such as a statin; ezetimibe; bempedoic acid; or injectables such as evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent) or inclisiran (Leqvio). The higher the risk, the more aggressive LDL lowering may be considered. It should be noted that the use of potent statins, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, especially at high doses, is linked to inducing glucose intolerance and risk of Type 2 diabetes. While this is not a common side effect, it requires attention since it is often missed from lack of awareness. A low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol often responds to weight loss and exercise. We used to think that high HDL was indicative of \u201cgood cholesterol,\u201d but more recent evidence suggests that is not the case and it may reflect increased risk when very high. To get a comprehensive assessment of risk via your blood lipids, it\u2019s important to get the apolipoprotein B (apoB) test at least once because about 20 per cent of people have normal LDL and a high apoB. Like low HDL, high fasting triglycerides may indicate insulin resistance as part of the metabolic syndrome and will often respond to lifestyle factors.\n\nThe lipoprotein known as Lp(a) should also be assessed at least once because it indicates risk when elevated. The good news is scientists are on the cusp of finally having medications to lower it, with five different drugs in late-stage clinical trials. 8. Reduce exposure to environmental pollutants In recent years, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the substantial pro-inflammatory effects of air pollution, microplastics and forever chemicals, all of which have been linked to a higher risk of heart disease. In one study, microplastics or nanoplastics in the artery wall were found in about 60 per cent of more than 300 people. Researchers found a vicious inflammatory response around the plastics, and a four- to fivefold risk of heart attacks or strokes during three years of follow-up. While we need policy changes to address these toxic substances in the environment, risk can be reduced by paying attention to air and water quality using filtration or purification devices, less use of plastic water bottles and plastic storage, and, in general, being much more aware and wary of our pervasive use of plastics. Reduce your exposure to microplastics by cutting back on the use of plastic bottles. Credit: Shutterstock\n\n9. Don\u2019t smoke By this point, it should be well known that cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor for coronary artery disease and should be completely avoided. 10. Get good sleep Although we tend to connect sleep health with brain and cognitive function, there\u2019s evidence that sleep regularity and quality are associated with less risk of heart disease. Regularity means adhering to a routine schedule as much as possible, and its benefit may be due to our body\u2019s preference for maintaining its circadian rhythm. Sleep quality \u2013 meaning with fewer interruptions \u2013 and maximal deep sleep can be tracked with smartwatches, fitness bands, rings or mattress sensors. Sleep apnoea, when breathing stops and starts during sleep, is fairly common and often unsuspected. So if you\u2019re having trouble sleeping or you snore loudly, talk to your doctor about ruling out the condition. Testing for sleep apnoea can involve checking for good oxygen saturation throughout one\u2019s sleep. That can be done through a sleep study or at home using rings or smartwatches that include oxygen saturation in their sensors and body movement algorithms that pick up disturbed breathing.",

        "text": "Loading\n\nCanterbury star Lachlan Galvin is prepared to have his hand injury needled in a bid to play in Saturday\u2019s clash with the Warriors.\n\nGalvin will be named in the Bulldogs squad on Tuesday afternoon despite a suspected hand fracture that threatens to sideline him for a clash that will have huge ramifications for the NRL\u2019s top four.\n\nThe Bulldogs halfback suffered the hand injury at the 20-minute mark of his grudge match against Wests Tigers on the weekend, but played through the pain of that setback. The 20-year-old is also hampered by an ankle injury, but has told those close to him that he is hopeful of lining up against the Warriors. He is even prepared to have a pain-killing injection to take his place in coach Cameron Ciraldo\u2019s side.\n\nMuch of the focus in the lead up to the Tigers clash centred on Galvin, given it was his first game against his former club since his acrimonious departure. The Tigers produced an upset 28-14 win, resulting in the Bulldogs dropping to third spot on the ladder.",

Picture: NewsWire/ Martin Ollman\n\nAustralia will lift the number of foreign students allowed to study in the 2026 academic year to 295,000, in a bid to safeguard the \u201cincredibly important export industry\u201d.\n\nThe figure is 25,000 higher than the number allowed by Education Minister Jason Clare for the 2025 academic year, but is still 8 per cent lower than the influx of international students after borders opened post-pandemic.\n\nIt will also not account for students at TAFE or those who enrol in a public-funded university but previously attended an Australian high school.\n\nUniversities will be able to request an increase to their 2025 allocations, but they must be able to show an increased engagement with Southeast Asia - as part of Australia\u2019s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 - and that they have enough student accommodation to cater to both domestic and international students.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe largest proportion of students from overseas were from China (23 per cent), India (17 per cent) and Nepal (8 per cent).\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare said the sector \u2018doesn\u2019t just make us money, it makes us friends\u2019. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nMr Clare said international education - worth $51bn to the Australian economy in 2023-24 and employing more than 250,000 workers - was an \u201cincredibly important export industry\u201d, but needed to be sustainably managed.\n\n\u201cInternational education doesn\u2019t just make us money - it makes us friends,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is about making sure international education grows in a way that supports students, universities and the national interest.\u201d\n\nHome Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government\u2019s priority was ensuring the international education sector maintained the \u201cintegrity of the migration system\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are making sure student visa processing supports genuine education outcomes and our strategic priorities \u2013 including increasing provision of student accommodation,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is about backing providers who do the right things and giving them the certainty they need to grow sustainably.\u201d\n\nSkills and Training Minister Andrew Giles also welcomed the exclusion of TAFE from the cap, saying it would allow the international VET sector to grow sustainably and better meet skills needs.\n\n\u201cThe diverse nationalities of international VET students present an opportunity to strengthen our international partnerships,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom today, VET providers can plan recruitment with confidence for 2026, knowing they will continue to enjoy equitable access to student visa processing.\u201d",
