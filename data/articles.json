        "text": "Young micro-investors are sinking their spare cash into shares after being locked out of the property market, leading economist Tom Piotrowski says.\n\nPiotrowski said unaffordable property prices have made stock market investments an \"attractive\" choice for a record number of Australians aged under 40 as home ownership remains painfully out of reach.\n\n\"The fact that it has become increasingly difficult to establish a foothold [in the property market] has certainly contributed to the fact the ease of investing in the share market by comparison is more attractive,\" Piotrowski told 9news.com.au.\n\nPiotrowski said unaffordable home prices in Australia\ufeff have made first-time stock investments an \"attractive\" choice. (Getty)\n\n\"You can see a pathway to building your wealth in a more incremental way rather than having to stump up with a very sizable deposit.\"\n\nThis month marks 30 years since Commonwealth Bank's \ufeffonline share trading platform CommSec launched in Australia and the economic landscape \ufeffhas undoubtedly changed enormously since 1995.\n\nIn the mid-'90s, \ufeffCommSec trades were done slowly by telephone and fax for $75 each and most investors were older, wealthier Australians.\n\nNow, \ufeffPiotrowski said, young people with various incomes are now using their smartphones to trade shares at lunch time hoping to build their \"nest egg\".\ufeff\n\nCommSec data released last year found 2.9 million investors under the age of 40 made up nearly half of the investors on the platform.\n\nAnd according to figures from Finder, Australians have an average of $24,020 \ufeffinvested in shares.\n\nThis casual investing may be funded by inheritance or a small amount of disposable income, Piotrowski said.\n\n\"We're in the midst of one of the largest transitions of wealth from the baby boomer generation to a younger generation,\" Piotrowski said.\n\nREAD MORE: Two teenagers charged with murder over deadly stabbing\n\nAccording to Finder, Australians have an average of $24,020 \ufeffinvested in shares. (Getty)\n\n\"Some are fortunate that they might be able to get some help with a leg up to buying their first property because of that wealth transition, others perhaps might not be that lucky.\n\n\"Investing in the share market is attractive to them from that perspective because they're coming into some money.\n\n\"They might not quite have enough for a deposit.\n\n\"From that vantage point, you'd certainly be interested in looking at the share market.\"\n\nThe percentage of customers trading on CommSec aged under 40 has surged to 39.8 per cent, compared to just over 25 per cent in 2020.\ufeff\n\nCommBank revealed the rate of women with share holdings has nearly tripled in the past five years.\ufeff\n\nPiotrowski credits this with a rise in online financial literacy since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLeading economist Tom Piotrowski. (Supplied)\n\n\"There are a lot more female content producers now that are interested in the share market, and that's important in terms of creating a commonality with the audience,\" he said.\n\n\"It's become far more mainstream than it ever has been and that is directly tied to technology and social media.\"\n\nCommSec's biggest day of trading in 2025 so far was in the wake of Donald Trump's tariff announcemen\ufeffts on April 7.\n\nBut Piotrowski said Trump's influence likely won't have much of a negative impact on investors willing to play the long game and ride the wave.\n\nInvestors under the age of 40 are turning to CommSec in droves. (Nine)\n\n\"Yes, things are volatile, but volatility has always been a feature of equity markets,\" he said.\n\n\"From time to time, you have seismic events that create big price movements. But it's a cliche.\n\n\"The thing that protects you against that volatility is that long-term perspective.\"\n\nThe information provided on this website is general in nature only and does not constitute personal financial advice.

        "text": "When 94-year-old Port Lincoln man Malcom Harris saved a man's life using CPR in the 1980s, he never thought the favour might be returned one day.\n\nThat changed in May this year when he went to wash his car and blacked out.\n\n\"I go down to the car wash and usually put a couple of $2 coins in. I can remember putting the first one in, but not the second,\" Mr Harris said.\n\n\" Next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed. \"\n\nMr Lear (left) found Mr Harris unconscious after the 94-year-old suffered a heart attack. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Emma Pedler)\n\nAndrew Lear arrived to wash his own car when he found Mr Harris on the ground unconscious and without a pulse.\n\n\"When I found him, he was bleeding from the mouth and nose, and he was a bit of a mess,\" he said.\n\n\"The hose was actually still going and the trigger was still on, so I don't know how long he'd been there.\"\n\nThe prawn fisherman said he had undertaken cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training \"more than a dozen times, at least\" over the past 30 years for his job, but had not once needed it.\n\nMr Lear is required to do regular CPR training as part of his prawn fishing job. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Emma Pedler)\n\nThat was until that day at the car wash.\n\n\"Adrenaline gets going; you hope you're doing the right thing. Obviously, what I had learnt was [still] in my head, and it worked,\" Mr Lear said.\n\n\"Doing it in a classroom on the floor with a bunch of guys that I know \u2026 I mean, it's just not the same.\"\n\nCPR is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions and rescue breaths to help someone who has stopped breathing or whose heart has stopped beating.\n\nIt is a life-saving technique that can keep blood circulating and deliver oxygen to the brain and other vital organs until proper medical help is rendered.\n\nMr Lear said the sheer adrenaline of the situation made it difficult to estimate how long he performed CPR on Mr Harris, but it might have been about 15 minutes before he was exhausted.\n\nAnother bystander had called triple-0 and it was critical Mr Harris kept receiving CPR until help arrived.\n\nFortunately, another good Samaritan, Steve Whait, arrived at that point to take over.\n\nThe electrician is also trained in CPR.\n\nMr Lear (left) and Mr Whait performed CPR on Mr Harris for about 20 minutes. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Emma Pedler)\n\n\"I was pretty sure there were ribs that were cracked or broken and that I wasn't making it any better,\" Mr Whait said.\n\n\"But the training tells you that sometimes ribs break, so I just kept going even when I heard another crack.\n\n\"Being an electrician, we have to do rescue training each year, but this was the first time I had to apply it.\"\n\nBoth said they had dodgy knees but did not think about it.\n\n\"I was buggered so Steve took over, and I think he might have been going about five minutes, and by that stage, the ambulance was there,\" Mr Lear said.\n\n\"The first zap of the defibrillator didn't do anything, but [with] the second one, they got a weak pulse, and we started to feel a bit better.\"\n\nMr Lear was full of praise for Ambulance SA staff, but said the uncertainty of whether Mr Harris would survive was excruciating.\n\n\"I stood back against my car afterwards and pretty much was shaking because I didn't know whether he was alive or not,\" he said.\n\n\"I was numb, not knowing what to do. I was going to ring my partner \u2026 but I thought, 'What am I gonna say to her?'\n\n\"So, initially, I just didn't say anything. She eventually found out.\"\n\n'The difference between life and death'\n\nAustralian Red Cross (ARC), which provides first aid and CPR training to members of the public, has seen a year-on-year increase of between 8 to 10 per cent in uptake, but said it needed to be much higher.\n\n\"This is a welcome increase, but the reality is we're still behind,\" said ARC's head of first aid and mental health training, Wendy Greenhalf.\n\n\"Australia continues to rank among the lowest globally when it comes to first aid training.\n\n\"That means fewer people ready to step in and save a life when it matters most.\"\n\nARC says about one in three Australians have completed first aid training in the past three years. (ABC News: Jasmine Hines)\n\nOnly about one in three Australians have completed first aid training in the past three years.\n\n\"Emergencies happen every day in homes, schools, workplaces and communities, so the need for more people to be prepared has never been more urgent,\" Ms Greenhalf said.\n\n\" Knowing what to do in those critical first minutes can mean the difference between life and death. \"\n\nNew friendship after close call\n\nWhile working as a prison guard in the 1980s, Mr Harris himself saved a prisoner in a similar fashion, having only learnt CPR earlier that week.\n\nMr Harris has saved a man's life using CPR in the 1980s. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Emma Pedler)\n\nAt 94, the retiree has already seen off pancreatic cancer and several serious heart surgeries.\n\nSince his close call at the car wash, Mr Harris has struck up a friendship with Mr Lear.\n\n\"I was in ICU. They put me in a coma to keep me going. I was three-and-a half days in Adelaide before I woke up,\" Mr Harris recalled.\n\n\"Andrew [Lear] came and visited, brought me up a little present, a box of prawns.\n\n\"I heard from someone that knows him that he likes a little whiskey, so we had a nice bottle of that there waiting for him.\n\n\"The other day, we had a nice little luncheon and a good chat. It was most enjoyable.\"",

        "text": "Chloe Craig wants to give her daughter Haylee the same childhood she experienced growing up in a mining town described as an \"oasis in the desert\".\n\nLeinster was established in vast bushland about 970 kilometres north-east of Perth during Western Australia's 1970s nickel boom.\n\nIt was built for workers and their families in the days before fly-in, fly-out work rosters became standard practice in the resources sector.\n\nLeinster is small and remote, but locals love the lifestyle. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nMs Craig's family moved to WA's northern Goldfields in 1991 and lived on a pastoral station, before settling in the \"closed town\" of Leinster.\n\n\"It's a great lifestyle \u2026 I've grown up here, now she's growing up here,\" she said of Haylee.\n\n\"The freedom she gets out here is second to none and not a lot of kids get it these days.\n\n\"It definitely isn't the same as when I grew up \u2014 there was a lot more kids and a lot more freedom \u2026 you came home when the lights came on.\"\n\nChloe Craig runs a smash repair business with her partner. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nBombshell announcement\n\nA year ago, that lifestyle appeared to be under threat.\n\nThe moment Leinster locals hoped would never come arrived in the form of a major announcement to the stock exchange on July 11, 2024.\n\nBHP's decision to suspend Nickel West originated from the mining giant's global headquarters in Melbourne and filtered through the ranks of the nickel bosses in Perth's St George's Terrace.\n\n\"Everyone's heart sank, it was the unknown,\" Ms Craig said.\n\n\"It was massive for the town. At the time it was horrible.\"\n\nHarry Reynolds runs Leinster Smash Repairs with his partner Chloe Craig. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nThe town's population halved, virtually overnight, as workers either took redundancies or were redeployed within BHP.\n\n\"Not on Christmas Day, but leading up to it and afterwards, there were removalist trucks everywhere and people leaving left, right and centre,\" Chloe's partner Harry Reynolds said.\n\n\"We thought we were safe out here for a long time, we thought nickel was all good.\n\n\"Then all of a sudden, they shut the doors.\"\n\nBHP estimates the population at Leinster has fallen from about 600 people to 220.\n\nThe Leinster Nickel Operations have been owned by BHP since its 2005 acquisition of WMC Resources. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nState agreement covers Leinster\n\nWest Australian law prohibits BHP from simply walking away from Leinster.\n\nUnder the Nickel (Agnew) Agreement Act 1974, which was approved when Sir Charles Court was premier, the Big Australian is legally bound to provide water and power to the town site.\n\nIt is also required to provide housing for police, education and medical staff for the town.\n\nWorkers who live permanently in Leinster enjoy heavily subsidised housing and free utilities.\n\nAny change of the status quo requires state parliament's approval.\n\nThe most recent update, in 2023, required BHP to prepare a community development plan, including \"proposed strategies for community and social benefits\" and to review its mine closure plans.\n\nThe leafy town of Leinster is maintained by BHP, which provides essential services. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nIt was the modernisation of the five-decade-old state agreement which gave Ms Craig's father, Peter, hope for the future amid major investment by BHP in an Australian-first nickel sulphate plant.\n\nThat addition to Nickel West's Kwinana refinery was expected to produce enough nickel sulphate crystals to make 700,000 electric vehicle batteries each year.\n\n\"When you see mining companies spending money, it gives you a sense of security,\" Mr Craig, the long-serving president of the Shire of Leonora, said.\n\n\"Leinster was moving pretty fast for a two, three-year period, and nickel was pretty steady until the bombshell hit with Indonesia.\"\n\nPeter Craig has lived in Leinster since the 1990s. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nIndonesia's emergence as a globally significant, low-cost nickel producer caught Australian producers off guard and changed market dynamics.\n\nThe result was at least 10 nickel mines closed across WA last year, from the Savannah mine in the Kimberley to the Ravensthorpe mine on the south coast.\n\nThe impact is magnified in the one-pub town of Leinster, where sombre celebrations are being planned for the town's 50th anniversary next year.\n\n\"It's been a huge downturn in the population of Leinster, around 50 per cent if not more,\" Mr Craig said.\n\n\" But we're here and we're still ticking over and, credit to BHP, all the facilities are all still operating. \"\n\nThe entrance to the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter is decorated with hard hats, personal danger tags and locks from employees who signed off for the last time in 2024. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nHe had been calling for answers leading up to the suspension announcement after months of speculation, during which he said the community was kept in the dark.\n\nThe question on everyone's lips is whether the Leinster nickel operations will ever restart.\n\n\"Who knows what the future is?\" Mr Craig said.\n\nReview limbo until 2027\n\nBHP has committed to reviewing its Nickel West business again in early 2027, which not only includes the Leinster operations but the Kalgoorlie nickel smelter and Kwinana refinery.\n\nBHP vice-president of WA nickel Dan Heal said about 350 of the 3,500-strong workforce has stayed on at Nickel West, including about 150 in the northern Goldfields at Leinster and Mount Keith.\n\nDan Heal says about 350 workers have stayed on for care and maintenance at Nickel West. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nHe would not say whether Nickel West would be put up for sale, but confirmed the Perseverance underground mine at Leinster was being maintained \"in a state that keeps our options open for the future\".\n\n\"It's very early stages of our review and what comes next for nickel,\" Mr Heal said.\n\n\" That work is in its early phases \u2014 it's too early to say, but the team is working through those options right now. \"\n\nThose options could be limited by low nickel prices which are expected to last towards the end of the decade.\n\nMathew Read and his young family moved to Leinster from New Zealand during the pandemic. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nBusiness community hopeful\n\nMembers of Leinster's small business community who have invested heavily in the town's future are taking a glass half-full approach.\n\nMathew Read manages a mechanical business, after moving to the town from New Zealand during the pandemic.\n\n\"It's sad to see the town reduced to a small size,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not so sure if it will reopen or not \u2026 they're [BHP] spending a lot of money on the place, but whether it reopens or not I am not too sure.\n\n\"We'll remain here in Leinster, we've definitely got a few years left here, as long as the town stays open, we'll be here for a long time yet.\"\n\nTim Fletcher has operated an electrical contracting business in Leinster for the past decade. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nTim Fletcher has worked in Leinster since 2011, and now runs his own electrical contracting business.\n\n\"Long-term, I think it's going to be OK \u2026 I've got a positive outlook in regards to Nickel West,\" he said.\n\n\" We're not running away \u2014 we're set up, we're established \u2026 they're playing the long game. \"\n\nSantina Morelli has lived in Leinster for eight years and runs a small business and volunteers for St John Ambulance. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nSantina Morelli has lived in Leinster for eight years with her husband, who works at the nearby Agnew gold mine.\n\nHer home decor business sells everything from baby clothes to household items but she has been supplementing her income by working part-time at the local supermarket.\n\n\"It's a ghost town during the day \u2026 it's very quiet,\" Ms Morelli said.\n\n\"You don't see the children running around having fun like we used to.\n\n\"There's quite a few families still in town \u2014 we've got 60 children in the school, but there was 120 before the shut down, so quite a few have left town.\"\n\nShe volunteers for St John Ambulance and hopes to stay in Leinster until retirement in the coming years.\n\n\"We love the lifestyle \u2014 it's not an easy lifestyle, but it's a simple one,\" Ms Morelli said.\n\n\"Definitely hopeful [the mines will reopen] \u2026 we ask questions and 2027 is when we'll get the answer.\"\n\nChloe Craig and Haylee at the Leinster playgroup.

        "text": "Australian champion Luke Plapp has delivered an exceptional mountain time trial at the Tour de France \u2014 but it was still a mere sideshow to yet another sublime stage triumph for runaway leader Tadej Poga\u010dar.\n\nThe 24-year-old Plapp gave everything to finish fifth over the unforgiving 10.9km uphill slog against the clock from Loudenvielle to the Pyrenean ski resort Peyragudes.\n\nThe Melburnian found himself leading for a couple of hours from all challengers after covering the brutal course in 24 minutes and 58 seconds, until the Tour's biggest guns came down the ramp among the final 10 starters.\n\nAnd while Germany's Florian Lipowitz (24:56), five-time Grand Tour champ Primoz Roglic (24:20) and two-time Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard (23:36) all surpassed the Australian's time, it was Poga\u010dar who once again showed them all he was in a different league as he clocked 23 minutes dead.\n\nIt was his fourth stage victory of the Tour that he's turning into a one-man super show as he put another 36 seconds into his advantage over Vingegaard, who's now 4 minutes and 7 seconds behind with the toughest stages still to come.\n\nPlapp, the big engine of the Australian Jayco AlUla team, had won the national time trial championship at the start of the year and annexed his first Grand Tour stage win at the Giro d'Italia.\n\nThis time, he had focused all his energies on this stage. \"The last minute, though, was painful, but all in all I enjoyed the race, nevertheless,\" he said.\n\nSlovenian superstar Tadej Poga\u010dar continues to blitz the field in the Tour de France. (Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\n\"I've missed the break these last few stages, and that enabled me to take it easy in the grupetto. I'll definitely be feeling today's effort in my legs tomorrow \u2026 but anyway, I wanted to represent the colours (of the Australian flag) well and I'm happy.\"\n\nHe predicted, as he sat in the provisional leader's chair watching the rest of the field trying to catch him, that the winner would be \"a minute or minute-and-a-half quicker\", but Poga\u010dar was so brilliant he ended up almost two minutes faster.\n\nYet Plapp earned one big scalp in particular, as he proved 41 seconds quicker than Olympic champ Remco Evenepoel, who was suffering on the climb and only just clung on to his third place in the GC, now a massive 7:24 behind Poga\u010dar. Lipowitz is just six seconds off a podium place.\n\nPoga\u010dar's latest amazing display came just a day after he had destroyed the field on the famed Hautacam climb, and he reckoned his 21st Tour stage win felt just as sweet.\n\n\"I'm super happy. I wanted everything to be perfect. I almost blew up in the end, but I saw the timer at the top and it gave me an extra push because I saw I'm gonna win,\" said the 26-year-old who is set to be crowned champ for a fourth time.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "The ACT government has scrapped a plan to begin charging volunteers to register for a Working with Vulnerable People (WWVP) card following community backlash.\n\nThe proposed $11 fee was set to be introduced in September, intended to offset increasing costs associated with administering the WWVP scheme.\n\nThe ACT Greens, the Canberra Liberals and some community groups argued the fee could be a financial disincentive to volunteering given registering for the scheme has been free since it was first rolled out in 2011.\n\nCommunity consultation with groups including VolunteeringACT and the ACT Council of Social Services (ACTCOSS) convinced the government to scrap the fee, with plans to review the scheme with stakeholders.\n\nIt's the second instrument the territory government has backed down on from in its 2025-26 budget since it was announced late last month.\n\nThe volunteer WWVP card fee is the second budget measure the ACT government has backed down on since it was released in June. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe first was a proposed $250 health levy, which was slashed to $100 for residential ratepayers after the government struck a deal with the Greens.\n\nThis time the Greens put pressure on the government in the form of a community petition, sponsored by MLA Laura Nuttall two days after the budget was announced, pushing for volunteer WWVP cards to remain free.\n\nIt's another example of the reality the territory government faces now it's not in a coalition with the Greens \u2014 it must negotiate with the crossbench.\n\nThe Canberra Liberals also pushed for the fee to be scrapped, announcing last week that they would move a disallowance motion when the Legislative Assembly next sits in September.\n\nKeeping the scheme 'fair, effective and sustainable'\n\nACT Minister Suzanne Orr says the WWVP scheme costs hundreds of dollars per person, per year. (ABC News: Emily Anderson)\n\nACT Disability, Carers and Community Services Minister Suzanne Orr told ABC Radio Canberra the fee was proposed to address financial pressure on the WWVP scheme.\n\n\"[That pressure comes] from a lot of people enrolling who don't necessarily, under the legislation, need to be getting a WWVP card,\" Ms Orr said.\n\n\" Per person on an annual basis [the scheme costs] hundreds of dollars, so it is quite a lot of money. \"\n\nBut she said what came through \"loud and clear\" were concerns from the community who wanted to volunteer that the fee may not be the best way to make the scheme sustainable.\n\nACT Government Services Minister Tara Cheyne says the government will continue to explore policy improvements to ensure the scheme \"remains fair, effective and sustainable\". (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nCity and Government Services Minister Tara Cheyne said the government had invested more than $5 million in the budget to support the continued delivery of the WWVP scheme.\n\n\"[On top of the people enrolled who don't need to be], we are also anticipating that there will be additional requirements under the scheme as part of national responses to concerns in both the early childhood education and care sector and the aged care sector,\" Ms Cheyne said.\n\n\"We will continue to explore further policy improvements to ensure the scheme remains fair, effective and sustainable, while continuing to protect our community's most vulnerable members.\"\n\nAsking volunteers to pay 'felt a little bit insulting': Greens MLA\n\nGreens MLA Laura Nuttall said she was \"stoked\" the government had dropped the proposed fee, calling it a \"huge win for the community\".\n\n\"We're really pleased as Greens, in the balance of power on the crossbench, to have negotiated another budget measure,\" Ms Nuttall said.\n\n\" [Volunteers] do it for free, and they should not be charged a fee. \"\n\nMs Nuttall said rather than passing the cost on, providing organisations better clarity around who needs a WWVP check would go a long way to reducing the financial demand on the scheme.\n\nGreens MLA Laura Nuttall says she was concerned the fee could serve as a disincentive to volunteer. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt)\n\n\"[What] came through to us loud and clear from so many people in the community was actually that it felt a little bit insulting, that after all of the hard work that they put in, that they would be expected to pay even more,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that volunteers provide really valuable contributions to the Canberra community, we know that for every $1 you invest in volunteers the community gets back $5.40 in return.\n\n\"And at the same time, right now cost is one of the biggest barriers to volunteering, and volunteers are already paying on average $12.76 an hour for volunteering anyway, so we were concerned [the fee] would serve as a disincentive.\"\n\nFee scrapping 'a win' for community groups\n\nVolunteering ACT CEO Jean Giese says the territory has a strong volunteering legacy, and this decision is a signal that will continue into the future. (LinkedIn: Jean Giese)\n\nVolunteeringACT CEO Jean Giese called the decision \"a win for the 279,000 volunteers\" in Canberra.\n\n\"Our joint advocacy with volunteers, community organisations and government has demonstrated the power of collective action and the value that community places on volunteering,\" Ms Giese said.\n\n\"VolunteeringACT now renews its focus on delivering the ACT Volunteering Strategy \u2014 a roadmap to deliver safe, ethical and sustainable volunteering for all Canberrans.\"\n\nShe said a key part of the strategy was to ensure the appropriate safeguards were in place for volunteering.\n\n\"We are committed to productive conversations with government, ACTCOSS and other partners to find solutions to the systemic issues within the scheme,\" Ms Giese said.\n\n\"The ACT has a strong volunteering legacy, and this is a clear signal that volunteering will continue to thrive now, and into the future.\"",

        "text": "Scott Thompson is an expert on Showdowns, but when it comes to the 39th edition of the biggest game in South Australia, he has seen nothing remotely like it.\n\nThompson has more experience than most in the rivalry game between the Crows and the Power. The Adelaide midfielder played in nearly two dozen contests between the cross-town rivals prior to July 19, 2015.\n\nThat day would be his 23rd time to play in the much-anticipated encounter. He would play two more before his retirement in 2017. But nothing before or since compared to what happened that day at Adelaide Oval.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield and Scott Thompson hug as the siren sounds to mark the end of the 2015 Showdown clash. (Getty Images: Michael Willson/AFL)\n\n\"Well, Showdowns have always had that fierce rivalry, haven't they? And I suppose the one glaring thing for me out of that game was the rivalry was put aside,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"It was certainly a game that I've never experienced anything like it beforehand and post that [either].\"\n\nTen years ago today, the two halves of Adelaide came together for the most combustible event on the city's football calendar, in a game filled instead with an atmosphere of grief, remembrance, celebration and \u2014 most of all \u2014 a unity unlike anything seen at previous Showdowns.\n\nTo understand why, we have to go back in time 16 days.\n\n'Everyone was in shock'\n\nNo one was prepared for the devastating news that emerged in the early hours of Friday morning, July 3, 2015.\n\nPolice had answered a call to go to a house in the western Adelaide suburb of Somerton Park where they found a wounded man and his wife. Paramedics quickly arrived but they could not save the man, who had multiple stab wounds. The man's wife was taken to hospital with leg injuries, while the couple's son was found a few kilometres away and arrested.\n\nWhen Adelaide Crows chairman Rob Chapman picked up his phone at 3:30am, the phrase \"nothing good ever happens after midnight\" must have been going through his head, but he could not have guessed what he was about to hear.\n\nFor Scott Thompson (left) and the Crows, the day of Phil Walsh's death was a day of shock and disbelief. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nThe man who had died was Adelaide coach Phil Walsh, a man whose energy, passion and individuality had made Crows press conferences unmissable affairs since his arrival eight months previously. The man arrested, and subsequently charged with murder, was Walsh's son, Cy.\n\nSo started an unimaginable period \u2014 for the family, the club, the whole of the AFL and the public \u2014 as everyone tried to get their heads around the tragedy and work out where football fit at such a time of incredible shock and sadness.\n\nThompson, now an AFL commentator for ABC Sport, was a veteran player and member of the Crows' leadership group, and he remembers exactly the moment when he found out.\n\n\"The media manager at the footy club rang me, it was about six o'clock on that morning,\" he says.\n\n\"I got the phone call and my initial thought was, I'm not answering any media thing at six o'clock in the morning.\n\n\"So I let it ring out and he rang straight back and the explanation that he gave over the phone still rings in my ears as to how blunt it was and the severity of what had happened.\"\n\nThompson and other club leaders were tasked with ringing the younger players, getting them into the footy club to help them understand what had happened.\n\n\"But they were obviously across things, and as soon as you jump in your car and turn the radio on, by that point news had spread quite quickly as to what had happened. So when they rocked up, they were pretty much well aware of the situation,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"What played out after that was certainly really upsetting and traumatic and emotional for a whole range of people as you'd understand.\"\n\nPort Adelaide lost to Sydney at the SCG on July 2, 2015. Within 12 hours, the Power players would be dealing with the death of their former assistant coach Phil Walsh. (Getty Images: AFL Media/Matt King)\n\nFor the Port Adelaide team, things were a little different. The team was in Sydney, the morning after playing the Swans at the SCG. The Power had lost the game by 10 points and had stayed the night at a hotel in the CBD.\n\nWalsh had been an assistant coach at the Power in 2014, before earning his shot at the Crows as senior coach.\n\nChris Sheedy was a data analyst with Port Adelaide at the time, and he was with the team in Sydney.\n\n\"We got on the bus early in the morning, maybe like seven [AM], somewhere around then, and the news started to filter through that something had occurred [in Adelaide], we weren't quite sure,\" Sheedy recalls.\n\n\"And then once we got to the airport, it all became apparent \u2026 and it was hard to avoid it, an airport lounge where the TVs are everywhere.\n\n\"Obviously everyone was in shock and consoling each other. And then we had a debrief that afternoon once we landed in Adelaide, and then they kind of cancelled the Crows game as well. And then to the Showdown.\"\n\n'Our game is in mourning'\n\nA tiny Crow fan looks to pay tribute to Phil Walsh at Crows headquarters. (Getty Images: David Mariuz)\n\nThe Adelaide Football Club headquarters at West Lakes was an obvious gathering point for people to pay tribute and respect to Walsh.\n\nThe front of the building became a shrine, as people came from everywhere to lay flowers and cards in honour of Walsh and to give support to his family and team.\n\nBut it was not just the Crows who were in mourning. The man born in Hamilton in Victoria played 122 games in total for Collingwood, Richmond and the Brisbane Bears.\n\nThe largest section of his coaching career had been spent at Port Adelaide, with 10 seasons at the Power from 1999 to 2008 under Mark Williams, including the premiership year of 2004, before a move to West Coast with John Worsfold.\n\nAn old Brisbane Bears jumper signed by Phil Walsh at the Fitzroy FC museum at Docklands. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor/AFL)\n\nThen, for just the one season, Walsh moved back to Alberton under Ken Hinkley.\n\nIn a city like Adelaide there's often less than six degrees of separation in the footy world, and the two teams were no strangers to heartbreak amongst their coaching ranks.\n\nSixteen months earlier, the Crows lost former assistant coach Dean Bailey to cancer. Again, both teams were in mourning, for Bailey had been on the same staff as Walsh as defensive coach in the Power's 2004 flag.\n\nBut Bailey had taken leave from the Crows to undergo treatment for his illness, and his death, while shocking at the age of 47, was one that people could understand.\n\nThe news about Walsh was much harder to fathom.\n\nChapman told Fox Footy that night it was not just a case of helping players and staff to understand the unthinkable \u2014 he called on parents to try their best to deal with their children's questions on what had happened.\n\nIt was a time beyond belief, where the spotlight was trained on the City of Churches and all those who had known Walsh.\n\nThe news of Phil Walsh's death led to officials marking the news, with flags lowered to half-mast at AFL House. (AAP: Tracey Nearmy)\n\nIn Melbourne, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan faced the cameras, saying \"Our game is in mourning today, as Phil Walsh gave such a lot to our game.\"\n\nThe decision was made to cancel Sunday's scheduled game between the Crows and Geelong at Adelaide Oval, although the rest of the round went on, albeit in a very sombre atmosphere.\n\nOn Sunday, when the Crows were supposed to be playing, thousands of Adelaide people representing all sorts of clubs walked to the Oval.\n\nThey gathered in silence in the stands, then came out on the ground as tributes were laid on the grass.\n\nFinally, the siren sounded.\n\nThe day of the cancelled Adelaide-Geelong match saw thousands of people turn up at Adelaide Oval to pay tribute to Phil Walsh. (AAP: Ben Macmahon)\n\nMidfield coach Scott Camporeale was the man to step up as interim coach for the Crows, with a huge task on his hands.\n\n\"[In the off week] we had a couple of light training sessions where it literally was, when I say light training sessions, just a little run around, but it was, bring your families down, have your kids there \u2014 if you have kids \u2014 understanding the importance of family and life outside of footy,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Hard work and elite habits': Walsh's philosophy\n\nWalsh made an impression from the moment he first appeared at West Lakes for his introductory press conference in October 2014.\n\nHis intensity and passion for the game were evident, and he rapidly became known for some of his sayings and analysis of footy.\n\nScott Thompson says Crows coach Phil Walsh 'laid a pretty strong foundation\" of standards right from the beginning of his time at West Lakes. (AAP: Julian Smith )\n\n\"Success doesn't come looking for you. You've got to chase it \u2014 and as a team the only way to do that is through hard work and elite habits,\" he said to the media on day one in the job.\n\nThat description became second nature, as players recognised Walsh's shout of \"that's elite!\" when someone did something he liked at training.\n\nSheedy shared an office with Walsh in 2014 and worked side by side on game days.\n\n\"I think that Phil taught me a lot. Every week he would present around opposition [tactics], and his game knowledge was obviously exceptional \u2026 but then he would also educate us off field,\" Sheedy says.\n\n\"He spoke multiple languages. He spoke quite fluent Japanese and was well travelled, so he would kind of educate us on a clip or those type of things every week.\n\n\"He would use off the cuff obscure references to then reference back to football, and that was probably his funniest thing, especially in the coaches' box.\n\n\"He'd come out with some one-liners and you'd just be like, 'where did that come from?' He's quoting a NASA astronaut or something like that, and you're like, 'I'm not sure where that came from. We're in the third quarter here, Phil!'.\"\n\nOne memorable example of these references came at a press conference just a week before he died.\n\n\"Great art comes out of a level of frustration,\" Walsh said, citing a visit he'd made to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.\n\n\"I'm not an art critic, but this is a man with great frustration and I looked at the painting Sunflowers \u2014 and for a bogan from Hamilton like myself, I could actually see beauty in that frustration.\n\n\"So although our fans are frustrated, [and] we're frustrated, we like to think there are still some masterpieces still to be painted this year.\"\n\nThompson says Walsh came in with a \"real intent\" as to the sort of coach he wanted to be.\n\n\"He laid a pretty strong foundation right from the beginning. But once he'd done that and he knew he had the players on side, he certainly relaxed a lot after that period,\" he says.\n\n\"You talk about the impact he had in a short period of time. It was huge ... He was a bit of a larrikin inside the four walls of the footy club. But yeah, the young guys in the group warmed to him quickly and loved the type of character he was.\"\n\nTears, circles of support and a tough return to footy\n\nThere was no hiding the emotions as Crows players walked off Subiaco Oval after their return to football against West Coast. (Getty Images: Paul Kane)\n\nThe Adelaide Crows returned to football eight days after the tragic events of July 3. The Crows travelled to Subiaco Oval to face West Coast, where Walsh had called home from 2009-2013.\n\n\"We packed up the whole club, basically the whole club went over to Perth and played West Coast over there,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"Literally everybody, family and parents of players were over in WA for that game where in the end we got pantsed by West Coast. But ... just the way that everyone stuck together and the respect shown was next level.\"\n\nThe Crows kicked six goals in the opening term to lead by 14 points at quarter time. But West Coast, who would finish second after the home and away season, kicked 8.7 to 0.1 in the second term and won by 56 points.\n\nWhat happened next, however, reminded everyone there were much more important things than premiership points.\n\nThe Crows players were overcome with emotion at the final siren. They joined their Eagles counterparts in the centre of the ground, forming a circle to pay a silent tribute to Phil Walsh. The silence was impeccably observed, as players showed raw grief in unguarded moments.\n\nAs the Crows walked off Subiaco Oval, the crowd gave them a standing ovation. At the entrance to the race, wives, partners and families of the Adelaide players gathered to clap them off the ground. It was a scene that no one in football would soon forget.\n\n\"There was a lot of emotional boys and staff after that game, and then we had to head back to Adelaide and front up against Port Adelaide in an important game the following week because our season at the end of the day was still well and truly alive, so we still had a fair bit to play for,\" Thompson recalls.\n\n\"And knowing Phil as a person the way he was, he would've told us to all pull our heads in and get on with the job.\"\n\nPort Adelaide paid tribute to Phil Walsh after their game against Collingwood, with players and staff gathering in a semi-circle on Adelaide Oval. (Getty Images: David Mariuz)\n\nA couple of days earlier, Port Adelaide had played Collingwood at Adelaide Oval, winning by three points.\n\nAfter the game, Port Adelaide's players and staff gathered on the ground in a semi-circle. The floodlights were switched off, and a tribute video to Phil Walsh was played, while the 44,000 people in attendance lit the ground with their mobile phones.\n\nThe video was soundtracked by the Birds of Tokyo song Lanterns, and the lyrics hit home with all, concluding: \"In darkness I leave / For a place I've never seen / It's been calling out to me / That is where I should be.\"\n\nA city and two clubs unite\n\nThe lead-up to the game was conducted in a different atmosphere to normal. At Alberton, Sheedy saw it was a different week for the analysts group as well.\n\n\"I think we definitely reduced some of the meeting times and those type of things,\" he says.\n\n\"I know we definitely gave people room to grieve and there was no obligations if you felt you weren't able to be in the room or you weren't able to be there.\n\n\"The club was really respectful around [people's] requirements going into the game.\n\n\"In those type of circumstances, we genuinely focused on the football and what was going to happen because it was hard to not get distracted by the external. And you probably don't need any extra emotional motivation, you don't need any videos or anything like that.\"\n\nShowdowns are a game apart.\n\nLike Perth for the Western Derby, Adelaide takes on an energy all its own as a two-team town sorts out the footy pecking order twice a year.\n\nFor days leading up to the game, Adelaide is charged with energy and banter, tips of utmost importance and bets between friends and workmates riding on the outcome.\n\nBut this was a different set-up entirely.\n\nAn unprecedented atmosphere.\n\nCrowds gathered on the banks of the River Torrens, near Elder Park, with screens for people who couldn't get a Showdown ticket but wanted to be there anyway.\n\nPower and Crows fans marched together to Adelaide Oval before Showdown XXXIX. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nPort Adelaide's walk to the ground started on King William Street in the city. Power fans would march down to North Terrace and through the train station to emerge on the banks of the Torrens and cross the curved pedestrian bridge to near the entrance to Adelaide Oval.\n\nNormally the two sets of fans would not think of doing anything together. This time, however, Port Adelaide invited Adelaide fans to join them on the walk to Adelaide Oval, and chants of \"Walshy!\" united both sides.\n\nDon't think that no one cared about the result, though. Once the ball was bounced both teams \u2014 and their fans \u2014 were as focused on victory as usual. But the theme of the day was bringing people together to pay tribute to Phil Walsh, and that theme extended beyond the walk to the ground.\n\nFor the first time, both teams entered the field together. Skippers Travis Boak and Taylor Walker approached each other and shook hands, before leading their respective sides through the banner simultaneously as a wave of applause swept around the famous oval.\n\nFor the first time, the Crows and Power players ran through a joint banner onto Adelaide Oval before Showdown XXXIX. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nOn one side of the banner was \"Showdown XXXIX \u2014 Get The Job Done\".\n\nOn the other, the message: \"Vale Phil Walsh \u2014 1960-2015\".\n\n\"Normally there's a lot of heat and emotion,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"And when I say emotion, like combative emotion surrounding Showdowns between Port and Crows.\n\n\"But for that game, it was like everyone came together as one in Port Adelaide and Crows and everyone inside the stadium on that day, which was wonderful to see.\"\n\nEmotion set aside as the ball is bounced\n\nAlthough nominally a Port Adelaide home game, many Crows fans came to Showdown XXXIX to show their support for the team and for their late coach. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nIt was a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Adelaide Oval.\n\nThere was a packed crowd heavily favouring Port Adelaide, but the Crows were focused early on.\n\nThey went down the wing on the scoreboard side, from Richard Douglas to Tom Lynch to Taylor Walker, and \"Tex\" found Josh Jenkins in the right forward pocket. Jenkins kicked the goal from a difficult angle after 90 seconds.\n\nThe Power fans weren't pleased, and they were less so when Matt Crouch capped a fierce passage of play with a lovely snap on his right from 20m out a few minutes later.\n\nShowdown XXXIX Port Adelaide vs Adelaide Adelaide Oval, July 19, 2015 Port Adelaide: 3.4 - 8.4 - 13.6 - 17.11 (113)\n\nAdelaide: 6.1 - 11.3 - 18.6 - 18.8 (116) Adelaide Crows win by 3 points Goals: Port Adelaide: Robbie Gray 3, Paddy Ryder 3, Jay Schulz 3, Chad Wingard 3, Travis Boak 2, Matthew Lobbe 2, Angus Monfries. Adelaide: Josh Jenkins 3, Taylor Walker 3, Charlie Cameron 2, Tom Lynch 2, Eddie Betts, Matt Crouch, Richard Douglas, Ricky Henderson, Riley Knight, Brodie Martin, Scott Thompson, Matthew Wright.\n\nThe game ebbed and flowed, until halfway through the opening quarter, when Ricky Henderson cut off a Port Adelaide kick inside the Power's defensive 50.\n\nHe connected with a right-foot effort that fell just inside the right-hand goalpost and as the Crows' cheer squad celebrated, a murmur went around the ground.\n\nNear the 15-minute mark, an Adelaide turnover ended with Matthew Broadbent's centimetre-perfect kick from the centre circle to find Robbie Gray 30m out. Gray drilled it, and it was back to 10 points.\n\nThe Crows answered within 90 seconds through Walker. But Paddy Ryder closed the margin again after a ruck penalty to make it a nine-point game.\n\nAdelaide were not done for the quarter, however, back-to-back goals followed from Brodie Martin and Douglas, the latter kicking on the run from 45.\n\nIt was getting out of hand for the Power, and there were sighs of relief late on, when Chad Wingard marked on the left side of forward 50, and kicked truly.\n\nAussie rules' State of Origin's last great hurrah, 30 years on Photo shows A split image with an AFL player wearing a Big V, a coach in shirt and tie and a player wearing red, yellow and blue. Thirty years ago today, South Australia played Victoria at Football Park in State of Origin's last great hurrah.\n\nThere was still time for Douglas to kick a behind before the siren went, with the score 6.1 (37) to 3.4 (22).\n\nThe home side then struck early. Wingard kicked to the hotspot from 60 out \u2014 eight players were shoe-horned into a couple of metres of space, the ball was marked by Ryder at the back. He handballed to Gray who hoisted it into the stands for his second, less than 40 seconds in.\n\nThe Crows answered with Walker's second. Then Patrick Dangerfield climbed high to slap away a kick to Ollie Wines outside 50. He regathered and kicked to the wing. Walker outbodied a Power defender then went long, with second-gamer Riley Knight taking a clean grab and kicking Adelaide's eighth.\n\nThe lead was 21, 12 minutes in.\n\nThe Power responded with a goal to Matthew Lobbe, but then the Crows took control.\n\nA snap from Jenkins and two more from Charlie Cameron followed \u2014 the Crows were flying, while the Power fans were getting vocal.\n\nRyder was Port Adelaide's main target up forward with Lobbe sharing the ruck. Ryder marked from a centre clearance and kicked Port's sixth, then couldn't hold a mark but popped up to boot home the rebound to make it 23 points in time on.\n\nJay Schulz then took an uncontested mark inside 50, and the former Tiger drilled the kick. When the siren sounded, the Crows led 11.3 (69) to 8.4 (52).\n\nPort mounts a comeback\n\nEarly in the third, the Power's Jake Neade burst out of defensive 50, carving through the Crows before eking out a perfect chip to Justin Westhoff. Westhoff kicked to Gray 30m out \u2014 Gray handballed to the running Schulz, who narrowed the gap to 11 points.\n\nThe home side had kicked the last four, but things quickly turned. A turnover led to Adelaide kicking to the one-out Jenkins, who gathered and booted it home.\n\nA couple of misses from the Crows followed, then another Port Adelaide turnover led to Walker and Eddie Betts raffling a mark near goal. Walker marked, kicked the major and it was back out to 25 points.\n\nNext the Crows went coast-to-coast after spoiling a Power attack \u2014 Tom Lynch was on the end of it to kick it from 40.\n\nEddie Betts missed some shots at goal in Showdown XXXIX \u2014 but the one he kicked from \"his\" pocket drew a big roar from the crowd. (Getty Images: AFL Media/Michael Willson)\n\nYet another Power turnover led to a kick to the scoreboard pocket, where Betts was waiting. He took a bounce, looked up as if to wait for the roar, then bisected the sticks from 25 out.\n\nWith nine minutes to go in the third, Adelaide led by 36 \u2014 it seemed done and dusted.\n\nOn ABC Radio, Peter Walsh put it simply: \"Crows running rampant in Showdown 39!\".\n\nBut straight from the bounce, Wines found Wingard, who kicked from 55. Neade flew but couldn't hold the mark \u2014 it was a poster, but the kickout went straight to Wingard, who dodged clear and dabbed home his second.\n\nTwo minutes later, Wingard took it on the left wing and swept in a kick that would have been a perfect cross in the Premier League.\n\n\"This could be something special \u2014 Wingard, to an unguarded goal, it rolls \u2026 and it's kicked through!\" Walsh told listeners.\n\n\"Monfries was there, and he slams it through! Just when you think the Crows have total control, there's a fightback!\"\n\nTravis Boak kicked a captain's goal to bring Port Adelaide back within three goals. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nWhen Boak snapped a goal from stoppage in time on, the Power were within 17.\n\nBut the back and forth continued \u2014 the Crows kicked back to back goals, then Schulz kicked his third with a minute left.\n\nThe Crows cleared again and Betts chipped to Walker. His diving mark went unpaid, the handball went to Thompson who kicked as he was tackled by Wines. The kick looped crazily and dropped just beyond the despairing grasp of Jackson Trengove.\n\nThompson had been ruling the roost that day as an in and under midfielder. His gritty approach and refusal to back down had made him a favourite of Crows fans.\n\nHe came to the Crows for 2005 after four injury-hit years at Melbourne, going on to play 308 games, averaging more possessions than his more famous teammates in Simon Goodwin, Mark Ricciuto and Andrew McLeod.\n\nBut he admits he wasn't even a Crows fan as a kid.\n\n\"I actually went right through Port Adelaide's junior grades through their development squad, so I had a strong alignment with Port Adelaide,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"It's amazing how things pan out and to spend 13 years at a team that as a junior I didn't watch too closely, or really care about that much. But I had a wonderful time over my 13 years there and I wouldn't change it at all. Absolutely loved it.\"\n\nDespite the Power's efforts the lead was still above 30 points, and the Crows seemed set for the win. What could Port do?\n\nThere were three behinds in the first 10 minutes \u2014 the Crows still led by 29 points and time was running out.\n\nBut 12 minutes in, Aaron Young intercepted for Port Adelaide and found Wingard, who kicked a goal \u2014 the lead was 23.\n\nChad Wingard had sealed a Showdown win for Port Adelaide the year before \u2014 his three goals helped keep the Power in Showdown XXXIX. (AAP: Ben Macmahon)\n\nIt was about 10 minutes to sunset as the afternoon stretched into Sunday evening, and the floodlights were on at Adelaide Oval.\n\nBoth sides were tiring, but the Power were coming. More misses followed, the margin 21 points.\n\nWith six minutes left, Wines kicked to the pocket, and Lobbe stood resolute and marked. Kicking from a narrow angle, watched by a packed hill, he kicked it \u2014 15 points, five minutes.\n\nSoon it was even closer. A 50m penalty led to Power skipper Boak swinging his boot through it and kicking a team-lifting goal.\n\nThe Crows were hanging on, as the nerves increased and the clock ticked down.\n\nThe last minute (and a bit)\n\nNine points the difference, and the desperation rising.\n\nThe Crows were trying to clear their lines, the ball skittered around near the centre square, and Knight caught Angus Monfries high for a free kick.\n\nPower forward Robbie Gray kicked three goals in the Showdown, the last of which came with 66 seconds left on the clock. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz/Getty Images))\n\nMonfries's high kick came off hands, Wingard barrelled forward like he was making a hit-up in the NRL, then dished out to Hamish Hartlett who braced and fired a handball to Boak. The skipper went sidewards to Gray \u2014 and who else would the Power want to kick a goal with the game on the line?\n\nHis snap was true, the crowd's roar was deafening, and the Crows led by three with 66 seconds left.\n\nThe centre bounce was furious stuff with bodies crashing in, a slightly dodgy handball from Ryder and no advantage. The second bounce was not much better, with the ball slewing around.\n\nNathan Krakoeur threw it on the boot in hopes of finding someone in a Port jumper, but it went skywards and was taken by Tom Lynch. 38 seconds left.\n\nLynch kicked to the wing, where two Power players converged, but could not stop Betts taking the mark.\n\nIt was under 30 seconds as the two chairmen, David Koch and Rod Chapman, stood side by side in the race, watching anxiously with arms around each other \u2014 another Showdown anomaly on this strangest of days.\n\nBetts went down the line, it was punched forward by Port, but Brad Ebert was caught by Douglas and that was that.\n\nDouglas kicked wide to Henderson, the siren sounded and the Crows had hung on to win by three points, the closest Showdown ever to that point.\n\nIn relief or exhaustion, players fell to their knees or pumped their fists as others raced together and the emotions flowed. It was an amazing win, no more so for interim coach Camporeale, who had galvanised the team in a short time.\n\nYears later, Dangerfield told the AFL's \"Last Time I Cried\" series about the feeling after Walsh's death.\n\n\"But the Phil one [his death] for me was like someone who'd meant so much to so many people, had galvanised the group so quickly,\" Dangerfield said.\n\n\"He'd trained us so bloody hard, never allowed to walk during a session \u2014 you could either run, or stand still.\n\n\"And he was all of a sudden, gone. And we'd seen a real uplift in performance and like 'this is the right path' \u2014 and it was done.\n\n\"[After the Showdown] It was emotional but it wasn't sad emotion \u2014 it was like, the game plan that he'd developed, and that 'Campo' had continued on, and had beaten our biggest [rival].\"\n\nThe crowd that didn't want to say goodbye\n\nChris Sheedy says the day brought home all that had happened.\n\n\"You kind of understood the gravity of how it impacted everyone's lives, I suppose, more than just, you lost probably a good friend yourself,\" Sheedy says.\n\n\"You understood what he meant to so many other people.\"\n\nPhil Walsh's daughter Quinn was at Adelaide Oval to present the medal in her father's name to the Crows' Scott Thompson. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nThe award for best on ground in Showdowns had always been the Showdown Medal.\n\nFor this game, there was an agreed one-off change to the Phil Walsh Medal. The name read out was Thompson's, whose 36 disposals (22 contested), one goal, eight tackles and 13 clearances stood out.\n\nThompson hugged Walsh's daughter Quinn \u2014 who was there to present the medal \u2014 and started by thanking the Power players.\n\n\"Today was definitely played in the right spirit,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"To the Adelaide Football Club and the Port Adelaide Football Club, a job well done on celebrating the life of a fantastic man, our late coach and a bloke that spent many years with your club.\n\n\"And to all the supporters here today, a fantastic job with the tributes. It's been overwhelming for everyone, thank you very much.\"\n\nWarm applause followed. Walker accepted the Showdown Trophy, thanking everyone for their support.\n\nThe cameras tracked across players from both sides, with emotion written on the faces.\n\nThe players joined in the minute's applause for Phil Walsh - but the fans in the stands didn't want to let the moment end. (Getty Images: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nThe clubs then invited fans to stand for a minute's applause in recognition of Walsh and his legacy and to thank everyone for their support.\n\nQuinn Walsh stood clapping alongside Koch and Chapman, trying to hold her emotions as the clapping swelled for her dad. Virtually no one had left. Indeed, there were suggestions the gates might have been thrown open in the final quarter.\n\nThe packed stands rang with heartfelt applause.\n\nCrows and Power fans alike, minutes after yelling their teams home, stood shoulder to shoulder in common cause.\n\nThe minute extended to a minute and a half and more, the applause swelling again, with fans exhorting people to keep going \u2014 one last moment of connection in a terrible fortnight that had brought the best out of the public, the players and the football community.\n\nIt was like they didn't want to stop \u2014 this last opportunity to say farewell, and thanks to Phil Walsh for his contribution to the game they loved.\n\nThe aftermath of the game\n\nCamporeale continued as interim coach for the rest of 2015, and while games lacked the emotions of the Eagles match or the Showdown, under his leadership the Crows produced a number of masterpieces in honour of Walsh \u2014 five victories out of their last seven matches.\n\nThe only losses were to Sydney at the SCG, and Geelong at Kardinia Park.\n\nAdelaide finished seventh, with a 14-9 record, setting up an elimination final against Western Bulldogs at the MCG. They led most of the day but trailed in the final quarter, before a Charlie Cameron goal in time on sealed a seven-point win.\n\nPhil Walsh has left a long lasting legacy with the AFL, but particularly with South Australian football. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nNext up was a semi-final against Hawthorn at the MCG, and that was where the season ended. Luke Breust kicked three goals in the first quarter on his way to a six-goal haul, Hawthorn led by 38 at quarter-time, and the Crows were eliminated with a 74-point loss. The Hawks would match Brisbane of the early 2000s with their third straight flag.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield left for Victoria to join Geelong. Despite the success, Camporeale opted not to apply for the full-time post as coach.\n\nThe Crows chose former Adelaide and West Coast assistant coach Don Pyke. Under Pyke \u2014 with Camporeale as assistant \u2014 they made the grand final in 2017, losing to Richmond.\n\nTime has moved on, and the Crows are coached by Matthew Nicks now. But Phil Walsh's name is still remembered in Adelaide.\n\nA year after Phil Walsh's death, a tree was planted in the grounds of Adelaide Oval as a permanent memorial. (Supplied: Adelaide Crows)\n\nA year on from his death, the Crows planted a tree in the grounds near Adelaide Oval and unveiled a plaque in honour of Walsh. That tree continues to grow, and the memories do not all fade with time.\n\nChris Sheedy has now been at the Crows for five years, where he is the head of football strategy.\n\n\"You often walk past that tree and definitely know which one it is. It's always something that's front and centre with us as a club and with the people who knew Phil,\" Sheedy says.\n\n\"It [Walsh's death] pops up on memories and Facebook feeds and all those type of things, and it definitely doesn't feel like 10 years. I always remember where we were at the time in Sydney.\n\n\"And for me personally, I remember the circle after the [Collingwood] game and being on the ground and they turn off the lights \u2026 and I still can't hear that Birds of Tokyo song [Lanterns] without thinking of Phil.\"",

        "text": "Lord Howe Island's only preschool may be forced to shut its doors, as operators struggle to staff the facility due to the island's housing shortage.\n\nFor more than a decade, resident and preschool committee president Rachael McFadyen advocated for the facility to be built on the island, located 600 kilometres off the coast of Port Macquarie, to help the community's working parents and provide essential early learning.\n\nAfter securing state government funding in 2018, the centre was officially opened in April last year.\n\n\"That dream is finally a reality,\" Ms McFadyen said.\n\nHowever, due to staffing shortages, the newly built, $800,000 facility has sat empty for most of this year.\n\nLord Howe Island advocated for a preschool for many years before its official opening last year. (Supplied: Chelsea Scott Photo)\n\nStruggle for staff\n\nMs McFadyen said that after the resignation of one of their educators earlier this year, the centre did not have the two qualified educators legally required to operate.\n\nIt meant the centre, which had about a dozen students, was forced to close its doors.\n\n\"We had to call the parents and tell them there's no preschool,\" Ms McFayden said.\n\n\" They have to work out alternative [care] methods for their children, or they have to cancel and not go to work, so it is a big roll-on effect. \"\n\nRachael McFadyen (left) advocated for a preschool on the island for 15 years before it opened. (Supplied: Chelsea Scott Photo)\n\nWith around 400 residents on the island, Ms McFadyen said a replacement educator had to be found from the mainland.\n\nAfter six months of closures, the preschool reopened in June when the committee secured a fill-in teacher.\n\nBut Ms McFadyen said securing someone long term had been made difficult by a lack of housing, as the number of homes on Lord Howe was limited by its world-heritage listing.\n\nFirst preference for homes is also given to locals who have lived on the island for at least 10 years, or are descendants of early residents from before the 1950s.\n\nThe fill-in teacher is house-sitting until the end of September.\n\nBeyond that, the committee said the preschool's future was uncertain.\n\nLord Howe Island is world-heritage listed with strict laws to protect its environment. (Facebook: Lord Howe Island Tourism)\n\nFamilies need certainty\n\nLord Howe resident and preschool committee member Chelsea Holden juggles being a mum of two young boys with her own photography business and a part-time job.\n\nShe said the preschool's closure cost her downtime and opportunities to grow as a businessperson.\n\n\"Those precious few hours each day when my kids are at preschool are everything,\" Ms Holden said.\n\n\"Not only are they in a safe, nurturing environment where they're gaining the social and emotional skills that will set them up as confident learners for life, but it also gives me space to focus.\"\n\nChelsea Holden is concerned lack of access to early learning will impact her children's development. (Supplied: Chelsea Scott Photo)\n\nMs Holden said, despite some challenges, Lord Howe locals loved their island home, and access to essential education like early learning should not be determined by postcode.\n\n\"Having the early learning on Lord Howe, there are a lot of benefits, and as a family, you feel confident you're making the right decision for your children because they're getting the same exposure they would on the mainland,\" she said.\n\nAt least 600 hours of early learning education is recommended before a child begins school. (Supplied: Chelsea Scott Photo)\n\nHousing needed\n\nThe preschool committee has called on the Lord Howe Island Board, appointed by the NSW government to manage the island, to consider new housing for essential workers, providing space for a permanent preschool teacher as well as additional nurses, teachers, and doctors when required.\n\nThe committee has started recruitment for a new, permanent educator, and it has been able to get a local family to reserve future leasing of their property for when they start.\n\nBut it is little relief for current tenants like Tina Dante, her partner, and one-year-old son, who now have weeks to find a new home.\n\n\"They let us know a few weeks in advance that they will not renew the lease because they need the house for the preschool teacher,\" she said.\n\nTina Dante says her family may have to consider moving to the mainland. (Supplied: Tina Dante)\n\nMs Dante said while she understood the decision, her family would be forced to consider leaving the island if they could not find a solution.\n\n\"It's a tricky situation \u2026 it's very hard,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement, a Lord Howe Island Board spokesperson confirmed long-term accommodation for the preschool had been found, and that the board was reviewing the Local Environment Plan, which would \"also consider adaptive housing solutions\".\n\nIt said accommodation for essential workers was already available, and the limit to the number of dwellings was in place \"to protect the island's unique environment\".\n\nMs McFadyen said until additional solutions were found, the island's businesses and essential services would remain under strain.",

Brian To\u2019o confident latest injury no concern Brian To\u2019o, arguably the game\u2019s best winger, suffered a fresh cork to his left knee, but vowed to keep playing for Penrith, and declared: \u201cYou\u2019ll always be busted and bruised, but never broken.\u201d\n\nThe premiers made it six wins on the trot when they defeated South Sydney 30-10 on Friday night, with the sight of To\u2019o coming from the field with 20 minutes remaining the only concern.

Panthers medical staff were confident To\u2019o the latest scare would not require scans, and he was likely to play against the Wests Tigers next Saturday. Penrith are one of the few NRL teams that have no players in the casualty ward, with Liam Martin (wrist) and Izack Tago (suspension) to return next weekend, while Isaah Yeo and Nathan Cleary were given the weekend off. Cleary trained at Penrith on Friday morning while being joined by Matildas\u2019 partner Mary Fowler.\n\nAs for To\u2019o and concerns about his knee, he said late Friday: \u201cIt was a bit of a stir-up. It\u2019s the same injury, there was just a bit of a knee clash. \u201cIt was a bit of a touchy feeling; it was definitely on the right spot. \u201cI\u2019ll always back myself to keep going. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the job [to keep going]. You\u2019ll always be busted and bruised, but never broken.\u201d Coach Ivan Cleary said of To\u2019o: \u201c\u2018Biz\u2019 can\u2019t seem to get through a game without some sort of trauma, but he should be OK.\u201d",

Len Ikitau: One of the best midfielders in the world, so the hope is the Wallabies use him more than as a battering ram. Rating: 8 11. Harry Potter: Will have his hands full against Tommy Freeman, and may have been picked due to his ability under the high ball. Rating: 6 10. Tom Lynagh: Has a calm head, but this is an enormous step up for a 22-year-old in his first Wallabies start. A concern. Rating: 6 9. Jake Gordon: The 32-year-old is a proven performer, but has no form to speak of and Ryan Lonergan\u2019s excellent game for the Brumbies against the Lions has put the spotlight on the Wallabies\u2019 selections at No. 9. Rating: 7\n\n8. Harry Wilson: Loved his toughness and mentality to literally drag his side across the line against Fiji, but probably needs an all-time performance in Brisbane. Rating: 7 7. Fraser McReight: Form hasn\u2019t been as good compared to last year, when he was arguably the best player in Super Rugby Pacific. The Wallabies need him to find that top gear. Rating: 8 Nick Champion de Crespigny is the bolter in the Wallabies team to play the Lions on Saturday. Credit: Getty Images 6. Nick Champion de Crespigny: As tough as they come, but a questionable selection ahead of Tom Hooper. Rating: 6 5. Nick Frost: The tallest man on the field needs to get up and challenge the Lions at lineout time, an area where he caused so much disruption during Super Rugby Pacific. Rating: 7\n\n4. Jeremy Williams: His work rate is exceptional, but the suspicion is that the Lions have the upper hand in power through the scrum and through contact. Rating: 6 Loading 3. Allan Alaalatoa: A mixed Test against Fiji from a scrummaging perspective, and will be attacked by the Lions. Probably the most important player on the field because if the Wallabies can\u2019t hold the scrum the Lions will feed off it. Rating: 7 2. Matt Faessler: Underdone after an injury-affected Reds campaign. Highly capable at Super Rugby level, but rival hooker Dan Sheehan is a bigger body. Rating: 6 1. James Slipper: Another contentious selection. Is Angus Bell carrying a niggle? Easily one of the toughest Wallabies of the professional era, but this is a big ask of a 36-year-old.

Tommy Freeman: One of the outstanding athletes in the Lions squad. Big, tall, strong and a proven Test finisher for England. Rating: 7 13. Huw Jones: Arguably the most impressive back on tour so far. Jones has played his way into the Test side and his sheer size will pose problems. Rating: 8 12. Sione Tuipulotu: Must have been a close selection call ahead of Bundee Aki, and has arguably been helped by the form of his Scotland partner Jones. Looked dangerous with ball in hand against the Waratahs. Rating: 7 Sione Tuipulotu trains with the British and Irish Lions. Credit: Getty Images 11. James Lowe: Has the ability to break your heart in numerous ways, not least with his big left boot. New Zealand Rugby was wrong to let him go. Rating: 8\n\n10. Finn Russell: The Scot is flying and has arrived in Australia full of confidence after guiding Bath to the Premiership title. Has been putting himself about in defence, too. Rating: 9 9. Jamison Gibson-Park: Will set the tempo for the Lions attack, and possibly has been holding something back for the first Test in terms of his running game. One of the world\u2019s best when in top form. Rating: 8 8. Jack Conan: There is no doubt the Lions lost something when Ireland\u2019s Caelan Doris was ruled out with injury. Conan has been solid so far, but he\u2019s a big man and his selection points to a brutal Lions game plan. Rating: 7 7. Tom Curry: Tough openside never plays with anything but total commitment and is a menace at the breakdown. Rating: 8 6. Tadhg Beirne: On his day he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s best, but his form on this tour has been underwhelming by his standards. Needs a big Test to justify selection.

Trump warned Murdoch, the founder of News Corp, the paper's parent company, that he planned to sue.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Donald Trump requests release of grand jury transcripts from Jeffrey Epstein case\n\n\"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his 'pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of the Wall Street Journal's parent company, Dow Jones, could not immediately be reached for comment. Spokespeople for News Corp and Murdoch similarly could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit comes as Trump faces increased scrutiny about his relationship with Epstein, the disgraced financier and sex offender who died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Epstein case has generated conspiracy theories that became popular among Trump's base of supporters who believed the government was covering up Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.\n\n\n\nSome of Trump's most loyal followers became furious after his administration reversed course on its promise to release files related to the Epstein investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Justice Department memo released on 7 July concluded that Epstein killed himself and said there was \"no incriminating client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Pam Bondi had pledged months earlier to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including \"a lot of names\" and \"a lot of flight logs\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWith pressure to release the Epstein files building, Trump on Thursday said he directed Bondi to ask a court to release grand jury testimony about Epstein.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US government on Friday filed a motion in Manhattan federal court to unseal those grand jury transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice said the criminal cases against Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell are a matter of public interest, justifying the release of associated grand jury transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Journal said the letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper said the letter contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newspaper said the letter concludes \"Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" and featured the signature \"Donald.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations that Epstein had been sexually abusing girls became public in 2006 \u2014 after the birthday book was produced \u2014 and he was arrested that year before accepting a plea deal.\n\n\n\nEpstein died in 2019 in jail after he was arrested for a second time and charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, who was photographed with Epstein multiple times in social situations in the 1990s and early 2000s, told reporters in 2019 that he ended his relationship with Epstein long before his legal troubles became apparent.\n\n\n\n",

I was planning to go all in from start to finish and that's what I did,\" Poga\u010dar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar won the Tour de France in 2020, 2021 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar had a sticker of the Hulk comic book superhero on his bike but said after the stage his hero was Spider-Man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hulk though, he's the one you don't want to make angry,\" said Poga\u010dar.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time he finished stage 13 at the Peyragudes Altiport where the opening scene of the James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies was shot, Poga\u010dar was 36 seconds faster than Vingegaard, while Primoz Roglic was third at 1min 20sec.\n\n\n\nDanish rider Jonas Vingegaard cycles during the 13th stage of the 112th edition of the Tour de France cycling race.

To be honest I'm relieved it's over,\" said the double Olympic champion.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost riders warmed up for the time trial wearing ice jackets to combat the sizzling 30C temperature at the foot of the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian champion Luke Plapp set the early pace and sat in the hot seat all day before suddenly packing his case and vacating it on seeing Vingegaard storm up the mountain.\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar was even faster.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1580m altitude the ride remained beneath the clouds and below the treeline, but even atop the hill it was punishingly hot.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Quinn Simmons gave hundreds of high-fives on the home straight as one of the rare riders appearing to enjoy the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's stage 14 is another punishing affair with around 50km of climbing but it will likely be raced in rain.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt starts with the famous Col de Tourmalet and ends at the Luchon-Superbagneres ski resort.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 15 is a hilly run to the walled city of Carcassonne but for Poga\u010dar there remains the spectre of three more massive mountain stages in the final week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also the prospect of potential chaos in Paris with three ascents of Montmartre's old cobbled lanes on the final day.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it's memories of singing or playing the recorder, learning music can begin at an early age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, it depends who you ask but there is a famous quote by a Hungarian ethnomusicologist, composer and educator (Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly) who said 9 months before the birth of the mother (is the age to begin music learning). So I think that sums it up quite nicely. It is never too young. But of course it needs to be age and developmentally appropriate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Dr Jason Goopy, a researcher and a music educator who has spent 15 years teaching in Australian primary and secondary schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has been trying to connect the dots - and figure out the role that music learning can play in supporting the wellbeing of young people.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the ages of five to 25 - what impact does engagement with music have when it comes to aspects of wellbeing, including emotional regulation, building relationships and promoting positive mental health?\n\n\n\n\n\nSifting through the research, he helped to identify 423 sources which were then whittled down even further - to keep the research goal in focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and the UK emerged as the key countries where the most work has been done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well what is really interesting is that this is an emerging field. And we did actually do an international scoping review of all the literature globally, but predominantly research is currently situated in Australia and the UK. And that is obviously something that as a global community and a scholarly community - it needs addressing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there were clear trends that emerged from his review, published in the peer-reviewed journal Research Studies in Music Education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The motivation behind this study wasn't necessarily to look at how to create professional musicians. It was how can we be our best selves through learning music. And so the benefits that we're seeing relate to social confidence. Relate to healthy relationships, relate to social cohesion, emotional regulation, identity development. There are also educational benefits, in terms of accomplishment and achievement. And these kind of benefits that are experienced through music we found are directly transferable to other aspects of life. And to those who are most vulnerable in the community, we found that they benefit the most. Achievement in music can translate to achievement in other areas of life very easily.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review also pointed to the factors that make a music learning program effective for the wellbeing outcomes of young people - across different settings, whether in a school or as a community initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\nTailored and bespoke programs were particularly effective at targeting certain population groups like Indigenous youths, those with a disability; or others from a refugee or migrant background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is quite a mix within this scoping review - and they include people who are disengaged in schools, to those who are struggling to connect with the current schooling system. There are also those who are experiencing mental health challenges. There is also included in the study - also music in prisons for young people who are incarcerated and in contact with the criminal justice system. So the whole range of contexts that we have engaged within this particular study, which is why we wanted to go beyond school. Because music is having a powerful influence even beyond school, in the community. But yes, we're finding yes, it's characteristics and properties of music that is making a difference - but also the social aspects of doing music. Music is fundamentally a social practice - and coming together to make music, even beyond listening to music we're finding is having substantial benefits to individuals and their communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of music to help support young people to thrive is something that Dom Brook is deeply acquainted with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you get it into shaping your story and having a voice especially for a young person or adolescent who haven't find their purpose or voice, music or lyric writing helps you with your emotions. It helps you have a voice a suppose. Find your sense of purpose and move through some of those maybe troubling emotions - and make sense of them. Music is the counsellor for that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 17, a second-hand guitar played an important role in helping him to get through some tough times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had an upbringing that was all over the place and no father figure. Quite poor. It was the next door neighbour that believed in me. He was throwing out a guitar and wanted to give it to someone who would use it. And it was at that point that I was just getting into finding my voice through music very late in the picture. Never did music in school. So I was about 16, 17. And I paid for a songwriting camp for me to go to. And this camp was one of those lifechanging moments that I came back from this camp knowing that I wanted the voice that I had found, the purpose that I found through music. Something was just sparked inside of me to help others - and change lives through music.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 20 years ago, he decided to do that with a youth mentoring program, Musicians Making a Difference - also known by its acronym MMAD.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe in-person outreach is in New South Wales and Queensland, with online programs extending access nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the mission is to help at-risk youth find their future direction - whether that be in music or in fields like journalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Young people out of juvenile justice refuges, kids that are homeless. Kids even from pretty good families, but they're sorting out stuff. But I would say the majority are at-risk young people. We create this special environment where at MMAD it's family. And where there is freedom from judgement. There is no judgement. It is a place they can be themselves. It is a place where they can find their childlike self again. And find confidence in that and then go onto make their lives remarkable. The funny thing about MMAD is our vision is to see have every young person have someone who believes in them. And we use music because it is such a powerful tool to be able to breakdown those barriers and find what is special about young people - and their journey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe work has been transformative for graduates like Daniel Harvey, these days known by the stage name D Minor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe musical artist found a knack for writing rap lyrics - a skill that was honed when he joined the program at the age of 14.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time he was referred by a youth counsellor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had been through so much at that stage. Foster care, refuge system, being a state ward. And not having a sense of belonging or feeling accepted anywhere. And then meeting MMAD just feeling like I belong someone, feeling that there was a bigger, purpose for me. Just having someone who believes in you - and being able to share my music. Having someone to encourage me through that process. And kind of use that music as a tool and outlet to overcome some hurt and pain, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat included communicating his experience of being homeless at the age of 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it took him on stage to audition for Australia's Got Talent in 2019, with an original song entitled 'Concrete Pillow'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat took him in the direction of continuing to cultivate his skills in storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the impact it has had on him is almost beyond words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If someone can listen to my music and they can feel like okay, they can overcome something. I should be able to share that (my story). And that for me is incredible. And especially, when there is a message behind it to raise awareness of the situation. It is quite big - and not something that I ever imagined. But the journey has been incredible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jason Goopy, the early experiences people have with music are incredibly powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the potential in supporting people to thrive has yet to be fully realised.\n\n\n\n",

She was very compassionate, very loving, very hospitable to people who came to the house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA migrant from India, Bhusan Gulati was 87 when she was diagnosed with a life-limiting illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a terrible shock for Vibha who had lived with her mother for 35 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The doctors said she had ovarian cancer and that she had less about six months to live. It was shocking. It was really shocking. I was losing my best friend. We loved each other very much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the diagnosis, Bhusan Gulati refused medical treatment and chose voluntary assisted dying at home in the care of her daughters, Prabha and Vibha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was important for her. She advocated for voluntary assisted dying. She wanted control over her death and the whole process of her illness. She did not want any chemo or radiation. Surgery was posed as an option, but that was also refused. She could manage herself quite well. She was just ill during the last week, she was going out to cafes restaurants till the week she passed away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVibha Gulati says a mix of Buddhist, Hindu and spiritual beliefs helped to farewell her mother in December last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had chanting here while she was passing away. So we had Indian chants, which are Indian mantras infused with spiritual energy. It creates a very calming effect on the mind and on the emotions as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile faith has supported Vibha Gulati through her loss, the grief remains raw and is, at times, hard to bear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My spiritual belief gives me strength, trust that I will meet her again and that she has not gone forever. I can feel her presence around me sometimes. So it's really, really lovely. But that loss is still there and I think it takes a lot of time to get used to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one reason she turned to an online support platform called the Violet Initiative, a national not-for-profit organisation that helps people navigate the last chapters of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I found out about Violet after she passed away and I had some counselling sessions online. The loss was great. It comes in waves so often that you think you're all right and then suddenly you'll be crying. I felt really understood by them. I felt they held the space very well to what I was going through. They didn't negate any feeling that I had.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVibha Gulati is not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years more than 30,000 people have accessed the service.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt offers guides and digital support, as CEO Melissa Reader explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are really trying to help families and communities be more prepared around the last stages of a person's life. People come to us saying, \u2018I just don\u2019t know where to start. My mum is in her late eighties, dad might've died a couple of years ago. I'm usually the eldest daughter stepping into that caregiving role. I'm managing my own family, work, life, career and I'm completely overwhelmed\u2019.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australia\u2019s population ages services like Violet become more crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaring for dying people in hospital already costs around $4 billion annually, according to Violet research.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Ms Reader says that figure will rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have about 12,000 people turning 85 each year today. In five years there'll be a fivefold increase that'll be 60,000 people reaching that age each year. And our health and age care systems are at capacity today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 180,000 people die in Australia each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Ms Reader says few have prepared a will or left clear instructions about their end-of-life choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Up to 90 per cent of us want to be cared for at home for as long as possible with our family and our friends and everything that's familiar to us and the right services and supports. But that is not what's playing out today. So, we see people having at least four hospital admissions through the last 12 months, about 33 or 34 days, and we see one in two Australians dying in hospital. That is our least preferred place to die.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Reader knows first-hand about facing the loss of a loved one.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has raised three children since her husband died of cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was just 39 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes that Violet can provide the practical and personal guidance that she badly needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were completely unprepared for Mauro's death. He died in intensive care. We were totally unprepared for it and it was a very clinical and impersonal experience and quite frightening for all of us, including him. This is not an easy stage of life. It's very complex, it's very emotional and there's a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Gibson is among Violet\u2019s 50 volunteer guides and as someone who has lived through grief and loss, she is proud to provide personal care and support for those struggling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was trying to run my own small business, a yoga studio, and then all of a sudden when my dad had just been diagnosed with dementia my life partner, Mark was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. And to say that my world flipped upside down is an understatement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was 11 years ago and the eventual death of her partner led to a life-changing decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was only 56 years old. And I decided I wanted to work as a grief and bereavement counsellor and care for people who were carers because I'd had lived experience. It was ideal. These are the conversations I want to be having. This is the help I want to be offering. I didn't ask for this to happen to me, but it did. And so I am now in that world as someone who has cared, so why not use that to help someone?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Violet platform also has an AI-enabled digital companion which offers personalised support in multiple languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolet\u2019s Chief Product and Technology Officer Yaniv Bernstein explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we have is a really clever, voice-based artificial intelligence agent that talks to people in the manner of a normal conversation. And this is based on thousands of hours of data that we have of experience that we have through our guided support program. People can have this conversation at any time. And what they then get is a real assessment of where they're at, what stage they're in, what their needs are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd those needs are growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolet Chair Kate Carnell says action is urgently needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are sleepwalking into the century's biggest economic and social crisis right at the moment. What I think we need to focus on is ensuring that people in the final stage of life get the care and attention and the dignity that they want.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs life expectancy continues to rise and the population ages, Ms Carnell says Initiatives like Violet are crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Digital technology is fundamental to having an actual solution to this problem. One-on-one approaches are important, there's no doubt and Violet provides those, but giving people access to information and feedback 24-7 by trusted sources using digital technology and AI will allow all Australians affordable access to the information that they need. And that's what Violet's focusing on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVibha Gulati and her mother Bhusan are among the few to plan their final farewell.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaring for her mother at home fulfilled her dying wish, she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was very pleased with things, and gave her a sense of peace through the whole process. And also it gave her a sense of control of her own life, which is what she advocated for her whole life and it's how she lived and that's how she passed away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Vibha Gulati has this advice for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do what you think is best for you and your loved one and listen to your inner self and you'll know what's the best thing to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport is available through LifeLine on 13 11 14 or Griefline which provides confidential support on 1300 845 745 and via griefline.org.au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "There are signs the cost of living crisis affecting Australians during years of high inflation could be easing, analysts say, but some charity groups warn rising wealth inequality mean the pain is not lessening for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy director of the Anglicare charity Maiy Azize told SBS News: \"It's really frustrating\" for people to hear speculation on whether the cost of living crisis is over, because millions of Australians are still struggling to afford essentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've had years of big price increases for things like food, things like fuel. Electricity has never been more expensive. Energy debts are really high, and of course rents have never been higher,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare has not seen any measurable drop off in people requiring its charity services, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're definitely not seeing any kind of slow down in the number of people who are coming to us for things like emergency relief, for things like bill assistance, financial counselling, that's certainly not improving, she said.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think when people hear things like, 'oh, the cost of living is getting better', they might think that actual relief is in sight and things might be getting a bit cheaper. But in reality things aren't getting cheaper for them. They don't need our help any less.\"\n\n\n\nHousehold spending ticks up\n\nInvestment research company Morningstar published a report this month telling retail investors the cost of living crisis would become a \"thing of the past\", as people start to spend more on non-essential items.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank analysis shows household spending rose for a third consecutive month in June, up 0.3 per cent following gains of 0.4 per cent in April and May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Household spending is starting to show signs of consistency month-on-month and should continue to pick up this year as consumers begin to loosen their purse strings,\" the bank's senior economist Belinda Allen said in a statement earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This recovery is taking longer than expected to occur, but there are green shoots emerging.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter its July meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) disappointed mortgage-holders and shocked market economists by opting to hold the cash rate at 3.85 per cent in a split decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany had expected the bank to lower the cash rate in line with inflation \u2014 the Consumer Price Index figure for May came in at 2.1 per cent, down from 2.4 per cent in April.\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank analysis shows household spending rose for a third consecutive month in June, up 0.3 per cent following gains of 0.4 per cent in April and May. Source: Getty / Traceydee Photography The annual trimmed mean inflation \u2014 which doesn't include major price swings and is the RBA\u2019s preferred measure \u2014 was at 2.4 per cent, down from 2.8 per cent in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorningstar chief investment officer for the Asia Pacific, Matt Wacher, said falling inflation means Australians could be feeling more confident about spending money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In real terms, adjusted for inflation, household incomes are actually growing again in real terms, which they weren't for quite a period there,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That kind of makes people feel that there's a bit more money in their hip pocket when they're actually earning more than the inflation rate again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWacher said that the savings rate \u2014 the percentage of their income Australian households are able to save \u2014 has rebounded since a low of about 1.5 per cent in September 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the March quarter it rose to 5.2 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\n\nReasons for optimism, or a crisis still 'far from over'?\n\nFurther argument for optimism in the economy is the fact the RBA is likely to lower the official cash rate even further, Wacher said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The market is still pricing in four rate cuts over the next 12 months, and that would certainly have a very large effect if that was to come through on consumer balance sheets,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australians aren't necessarily going to feel like they are out of the woods, the Australia Institute's senior economist, Matt Grudnoff, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are likely to still be feeling the pinch,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When people talk about inflation easing, they don't mean that prices are going backwards, they just mean that they're not increasing as fast as they once were.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGrudnoff said Australians with mortgages haven't changed their behaviour significantly since the RBA started introducing rate cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Around 80 per cent of people haven't adjusted their repayments [since the cute were introduced],\" he said. \"So effectively, rather than taking the extra money, people are just paying down debt faster, which suggests that they're not increasing their spending in response to this cutting interest rates, which tells me that they're still quite worried and uncertain about the future.\"\n\n\n\nAustralians with mortgages haven't changed their behaviour significantly since the RBA started introducing rate cuts, according to economist Matt Grudnoff. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi When people are uncertain and worried about the economy, \"their first reaction is to kind of pay down debt and get ahead in order to build a buffer against any future kind of shock,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrudnoff said a rise in the unemployment rate announced on Thursday \u2014 from 4.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent since last month \u2014 could be one of several factors contributing to consumer uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If unemployment is going up, people might be worried about their jobs. The economy's growth is almost flat so they're worried about their jobs and if they're uncertain and worried, they're not going to be rushing out and spending on discretionary items.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Council Of Social Service CEO Cassandra Goldie said the cost of living crisis is \"far from over\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are persistent cost pressures that are placing people on low incomes under enormous financial stress,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Housing affordability has continued to deteriorate, while rental stress has become more persistent and is damaging people\u2019s health.\"\n\n\n\n",

Chinese tourism to Australia is the largest source of tourism by value. It is worth more than $9 billion a year already. And so people should see the potential benefits of increasing Chinese tourism to Australia.

Following the practice swing controversy, Lowry said he would not be called a \u201ccheat\u201d. After the penalty, Lowry\u2019s scorecard changed to reflect a double-bogey seven on the 12th hole and a one-over par round of 72. He now sits even par for the tournament in a tie for 34th heading into the weekend.\n\nHad he not been deemed to have breached a rule on the 12th, he would have begun his round on Saturday tied for 26th, alongside Leishman. Local fans will once again turn out in their droves on Saturday to support Lowry and Northern Irish hero Rory McIlroy, who put himself in contention by shooting 69, leaving him three-under for the tournament and a genuine chance of doing damage. McIlroy will head into Saturday seven shots behind world number one Scottie Scheffler, who played an incredible second round of 64, which included eight birdies and one bogey. Marc Leishman plays his tee shot on the 13th hole during the second round of the British Open.

American Brian Harman, who won The Open two years ago at Royal Liverpool, and China\u2019s Haotong Li are two shots back at eight-under par. Queensland\u2019s Elvis Smylie birdied two of the last three holes to finish three over and miss the cut by one, while Victorian Lucas Herbert nearly holed out from 162 yards on 18 to eagle the final hole and put himself within the cut line, but was ultimately too far back. At two-over for the tournament, Day was actually inside the cut-line when he walked off the 18th green in the middle of the afternoon but was outside by the end of play. If he was true to his word, Leishman would have been on his second pint of Guinness watching his fellow Australians toiling away when the first of two vicious bands of rain lashed the course.\n\nMarc Leishman in action at Portrush. Credit: AP The Victorian was in the first group on Friday morning (local time), which was both good and bad. Loading A 4am alarm clock was far from ideal, but it did mean he got the best of the conditions on a dry second morning at the coastal course. \u201cEverything felt pretty good. I putted well, [and] probably left a couple out there. I had a three-putt on [hole] 5, but that was a really tough pin. I drove it well, [and] didn\u2019t hit any fairway bunkers today, which was good. That\u2019s what killed me yesterday,\u201d Leishman told reporters after walking off the 18th, where he pushed a birdie putt just wide after a beautiful eight-iron approach.\n\nHe said he was happy overall. \u201cObviously that little mishap on 13 there \u2013 it\u2019s a bit scary when that happens. [There was a] two-hole stretch that [I] didn\u2019t sort of do a whole lot wrong apart from that tee shot on 13.\u201d After birdying five of the opening 12 holes, Leishman made back-to-back bogies before steadying the ship to finish at one-under for the first two rounds. \u201cYeah, obviously I would have liked to go a little bit lower, but we always do as golfers. Happy to be watching it on TV. I\u2019ll probably have a pint or two of Guinness and enjoy my afternoon,\u201d he said. Royal Portrush won\u2019t be a place Adam Scott will be racing back to, however.\n\nAdam Scott came into the second round in decent striking form but had a disastrous day, carding an eight-over round of 79 to crash out of the tournament. Credit: Getty Images The 2013 Masters champion came into the second round in decent striking form but had a disastrous day, carding an eight-over round of 79 to crash out of the tournament. Scott made double bogeys on holes three, 11 and 16 and bogeys on nine, 10 and 18 on a day on which almost everything went wrong. He was one of four Australians to finish in the last 20 on the leaderboard, with 2022 Open winner Cam Smith posting an equally disastrous seven-over round of 79, toensure the Queenslander missed the cut at all four majors of the year. Ryan Peake finished eight over for the tournament after shooting 73 on Friday, alongside West Australian Curtis Luck who struck the ball well during the second round to shoot one under the card after a horror opening round of 80.\n\n\u2018If the ball moved, I would have called it on myself. My head was definitely looking down at the ball and I didn\u2019t see it moving, but I\u2019m out there signing for a 72 now.\u2019 Shane Lowry Luck admitted after the round that he has been struggling with significant health concerns, with neck, groin and back issues continuing to plague his ability to play and even practice consistently. \u201cThe MRI has come back clean and my spine is in good order so we are just trying to figure out what the issue is with my movement patterns. I had to avoid a lot of activities to make sure that I was healthy enough to play here. Fellow West Australian Min Woo Lee cut a frustrated figure across the two days, with rounds of 74 and 73 not enough to threaten the cut line at any stage throughout the tournament. \u201cYeah, it was there, but also not, yeah, I just didn\u2019t convert anything,\u201d he told Australian reporters after walking off the 18th on Friday.",

Dylan Edwards was excellent for the premiers, bagging a double and running for nearly 300m. Credit: Getty Images Who knows what is behind the shocking number of injuries that have rocked the Bunnies. Some fans are convinced it has something to do with the move away from their spiritual base at Redfern to Heffron Park in recent years. The club reviewed their training programs earlier this year and were none the wiser. Good luck trying to work out who will be fit to take the field against Cronulla next Saturday.\n\nThe Bunnies are busted. The best thing about them will be whether Alex Johnston can close in on Ken Irvine\u2019s long-standing try-scoring record. Johnston\u2019s try just before full-time moved him to 207 career tries \u2013 five short of Irvine\u2019s 212. Johnston was Souths\u2019 main attacking threat in the first half. In the next three weeks, Penrith meet the Wests Tigers, Gold Coast Titans and Newcastle \u2013 all winnable games on paper \u2013 before a Thursday-night bell-ringer against old foes Melbourne. The only knock is their lousy crowds at their makeshift Parramatta home. There were 11,836 fans on Friday night, allegedly. But who cares? At least most of the Panthers\u2019 players are fit. Brian To\u2019o confident latest injury no concern Brian To\u2019o, arguably the game\u2019s best winger, suffered a fresh cork to his left knee, but vowed to keep playing for Penrith, and declared: \u201cYou\u2019ll always be busted and bruised, but never broken.\u201d\n\nThe premiers made it six wins on the trot when they defeated South Sydney 30-10 on Friday night, with the sight of To\u2019o coming from the field with 20 minutes remaining the only concern.

Panthers medical staff were confident To\u2019o the latest scare would not require scans, and he was likely to play against the Wests Tigers next Saturday. Penrith are one of the few NRL teams that have no players in the casualty ward, with Liam Martin (wrist) and Izack Tago (suspension) to return next weekend, while Isaah Yeo and Nathan Cleary were given the weekend off.

Harry Potter: Will have his hands full against Tommy Freeman, and may have been picked due to his ability under the high ball. Rating: 6 10. Tom Lynagh: Has a calm head, but this is an enormous step up for a 22-year-old in his first Wallabies start. A concern. Rating: 6 9. Jake Gordon: The 32-year-old is a proven performer, but has no form to speak of and Ryan Lonergan\u2019s excellent game for the Brumbies against the Lions has put the spotlight on the Wallabies\u2019 selections at No. 9. Rating: 7\n\n8. Harry Wilson: Loved his toughness and mentality to literally drag his side across the line against Fiji, but probably needs an all-time performance in Brisbane. Rating: 7 7.

Rating: 8 Nick Champion de Crespigny is the bolter in the Wallabies team to play the Lions on Saturday. Credit: Getty Images 6. Nick Champion de Crespigny: As tough as they come, but a questionable selection ahead of Tom Hooper. Rating: 6 5. Nick Frost: The tallest man on the field needs to get up and challenge the Lions at lineout time, an area where he caused so much disruption during Super Rugby Pacific. Rating: 7\n\n4. Jeremy Williams: His work rate is exceptional, but the suspicion is that the Lions have the upper hand in power through the scrum and through contact. Rating: 6 Loading 3. Allan Alaalatoa: A mixed Test against Fiji from a scrummaging perspective, and will be attacked by the Lions. Probably the most important player on the field because if the Wallabies can\u2019t hold the scrum the Lions will feed off it. Rating: 7 2. Matt Faessler: Underdone after an injury-affected Reds campaign. Highly capable at Super Rugby level, but rival hooker Dan Sheehan is a bigger body. Rating: 6 1. James Slipper: Another contentious selection. Is Angus Bell carrying a niggle? Easily one of the toughest Wallabies of the professional era, but this is a big ask of a 36-year-old.

Credit: Getty Images 15. Hugo Keenan: A class act, but is in the team due to injuries to others, and his form isn\u2019t where it was a few years ago. Rating: 7\n\n14. Tommy Freeman: One of the outstanding athletes in the Lions squad. Big, tall, strong and a proven Test finisher for England. Rating: 7 13. Huw Jones: Arguably the most impressive back on tour so far. Jones has played his way into the Test side and his sheer size will pose problems. Rating: 8 12. Sione Tuipulotu: Must have been a close selection call ahead of Bundee Aki, and has arguably been helped by the form of his Scotland partner Jones. Looked dangerous with ball in hand against the Waratahs. Rating: 7 Sione Tuipulotu trains with the British and Irish Lions. Credit: Getty Images 11. James Lowe: Has the ability to break your heart in numerous ways, not least with his big left boot. New Zealand Rugby was wrong to let him go. Rating: 8\n\n10. Finn Russell: The Scot is flying and has arrived in Australia full of confidence after guiding Bath to the Premiership title. Has been putting himself about in defence, too. Rating: 9 9. Jamison Gibson-Park: Will set the tempo for the Lions attack, and possibly has been holding something back for the first Test in terms of his running game. One of the world\u2019s best when in top form. Rating: 8 8. Jack Conan: There is no doubt the Lions lost something when Ireland\u2019s Caelan Doris was ruled out with injury. Conan has been solid so far, but he\u2019s a big man and his selection points to a brutal Lions game plan. Rating: 7 7. Tom Curry: Tough openside never plays with anything but total commitment and is a menace at the breakdown. Rating: 8 6. Tadhg Beirne: On his day he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s best, but his form on this tour has been underwhelming by his standards. Needs a big Test to justify selection. Rating: 6\n\nTadhg Beirne against the AUNZ XI in Adelaide. Credit: Getty Images 5. Joe McCarthy: Powerhouse second-rower has been selected to drive home where the Lions believe they have the clearest advantage \u2013 up front. Rating: 7 4. Maro Itoje: Impressive England captain is one of those players who can impose himself on a Test due to the strength of his all-round game. Rating: 8 3. Tadhg Furlong: The veteran has improved vastly since his first outing against Argentina before the tour proper got under way. Was underdone then but looks determined to make a scrum statement now. Rating: 8 Loading\n\n2. Dan Sheehan: A world-class hooker who can do it all. Watch out for him hugging the touchline to show his athleticism. Rating: 9 1.

The person who raised the complaint didn\u2019t say anything at the time. So John only found out a few weeks ago that this issue had been raised.\n\n\u201cThis has hit him like a ton of bricks as he does not recall it.\u201d\n\nThe Standard has contacted Torode\u2019s representative and the BBC for comment.\n\nTorode\u2019s contract with the BBC was not renewed after an allegation of using racist language was upheld in a review into the behaviour of his co-host Gregg Wallace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe report, commissioned by MasterChef production company Banijay UK and led by law firm Lewis Silkin, found 45 out of 83 allegations against Wallace were substantiated, alongside two standalone allegations made against other people, including one for using racist language.\n\nTorode said he had \u201cno recollection of the incident\u201d and was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the allegation.\n\n\u201cI have absolutely no recollection of any of this, and I do not believe that it happened,\u201d he said on Instagram.\n\n\u201cHowever, I want to be clear that I\u2019ve always had the view that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked and saddened by the allegation as I would never wish to cause anyone any offence.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed he found out about his firing by reading about it the press.\n\nThe chef pictured with Gregg on MasterChef (PA) (PA Media)\n\n\u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t heard from anyone at the BBC or Banijay - I am seeing and reading that I\u2019ve been \u2018sacked\u2019 from MasterChef and I repeat that I have no recollection of what I\u2019m accused of,\u201d the chef wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe inquiry could not even state the date or year of when I am meant to have said something wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hoped that I\u2019d have some say in my exit from a show I\u2019ve worked on since its relaunch in 2005, but events in last few days seem to have prevented that.\u201d\n\nTorode said Celebrity MasterChef and two Christmas specials which he recently filmed \u201cwill be my last\u201d. It is not clear if the BBC will air these shows.\n\nHe went on: \u201cPersonally, I have loved every minute working on MasterChef, but it\u2019s time to pass the cutlery to someone else. For whoever takes over, love it as I have.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe will not tolerate racist language of any kind and, as we have already said, we told Banijay UK, the makers of MasterChef, that action must be taken.\n\nAmid the controversy, ITV has revealed it will continue to air Torode\u2019s cooking show with his wife Lisa Faulker, John and Lisa\u2019s Weekend Kitchen.",

Four have been interim posts and two permanent.\n\nAbi Gbago resigned and was asked to sign an NDA, the Standard was told (Newham Council)\n\nA source said the report being discussed contained a \u201cseries of concerning allegations\u201d but there is no suggestion of wrongdoing on Ms Gbago\u2019s part.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is understood Ms Gbago was asked to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before leaving to take a \u201ccareer break\u201d.\n\n\"Newham is a wonderful borough and one I have been proud to serve,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for all the support and encouragement I have received from within and outside the council.\n\n\u201cI wish the council well on the next stage of its journey. I will miss all of the workforce, elected members and partners that I have had the pleasure of working with, but it is time to rest and reset after navigating the council through a busy nearly two years\"\n\nThe public and press were barred from attending the meeting. But the Standard understands Ms Gbago\u2018s payout will amount to over \u00a3230,000.\n\nMs Fiaz said: \u201cPaul is amongst the most experienced chief executives in local government and I am delighted that he will be joining us in Newham. His experience and wisdom will be a huge benefit to the Council as we accelerate our improvement programme.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn May, the Government announced it was monitoring the local authority amid concerns about the town hall\u2019s finances, culture and the value it is providing for taxpayers.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) issued a \u201cBest Value Notice\u201d, which means the council will be observed for 12 months to ensure it is improving.\n\nNewham Mayor Rokshana Fiaz has had six chief exectives in the seven years she has run the borough\n\nMinisters were concerned that \u201csignificant value for money weaknesses\u201d had been identified as well as \u201ccultural and governance issues\u201d.\n\nThey also had \u201csignificant delivery concerns about some of the programmes delivered by the authority\u201d, particularly housing.\n\nNewham has been handed the worst ever rating issued by the Government regulator for the state of its social housing amid warnings tenants were being put at \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d.\n\nMs Fiaz in December settled an Employment Tribunal claim brought against her own council.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe directly elected executive mayor alleged race and sex discrimination. She later withdrew the claim and the local authority agreed to pay \u00a336,000 toward her legal costs, as part of the overall settlement.\n\nIt came as Newham residents saw a 9% council tax hike in April - almost twice the amount allowed elsewhere in the country - when the town hall argued it would go bust without increased financial support.\n\nThe borough was forced to implement a raft of extreme cost cutting measures and requested emergency funding from central government as the cost of housing homeless families pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy.",

        "text": "Grapefruit were tipped to be the next Beatles \u2013 what happened to the band once loved by John Lennon?\n\nCilla Black, Brian Jones, Donovan, Ringo Starr, John Lennon and Paul McCartney are huddled around a conference table at the Hanover Grand Hotel in London. It\u2019s January 1968, and in front of the starry lineup are Grapefruit, the newest act signed to The Beatles\u2019 music publishing division, Apple Publishing.\n\nLennon is addressing the media, introducing this upcoming band, who are swilling their drinks and pulling on cigarettes behind him, as the next big thing. A flash goes off and a photograph is taken of Grapefruit surrounded by some of the biggest names of the 1960s. It\u2019s an image that would land the band a gig supporting the Bee Gees on tour, and see them rubbing shoulders with model-of-the-moment Twiggy, giving rise to a track titled \u201cTheme for Twiggy\u201d. Now, it\u2019s simply a relic of a band whose career idled before it got started.\n\nGrapefruit was one of several acts signed to Apple Corps, James Taylor among them. As a band, they were notable not only for their sound \u2013 a Beatles-esque blend of pop with splashes of psychedelia over lush orchestral arrangements \u2013 but for their connections to the music industry. Glaswegian frontman George Alexander had a brother in George Young of The Easybeats. His other siblings, Malcolm and Angus, founded the rock band AC/DC.\n\nAlexander was 29 and already friendly with The Beatles when he was signed by Apple Publishing manager Terry Doran. He had played the saxophone in The Bobby Patrick Big Six, a Glaswegian band that emerged onto the Hamburg rock scene alongside the Fab Four. According to their keyboardist, John Wiggins, the Big Six and The Beatles soon became inseparable, bonding over their lofty aspirations and penchant for musical experimentation. But it was in November 1967, when Alexander joined with fellow Doran signing John Perry, that Grapefruit began to take shape.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPerry, a budding songwriter who performed with the vocal harmony group Tony Rivers & The Castaways, had met Doran at the Speakeasy club in London. \u201cI got chatting to a rather eccentric Liverpudlian called Terry Doran,\u201d he told It\u2019s Psychedelic Baby magazine in 2023. \u201cHe said he was from Apple Publishing, which I\u2019d never heard of \u2013 it\u2019d just started and sounded like a greengrocer\u2019s shop \u2013 and that he was looking for songs. We had a hilarious night together as I was also insane, and at the end he gave me a card and said to call.\u201d\n\nDoran ultimately turned down Perry\u2019s songs, but suggested that he, along with his Castaways buddies, brothers Geoff and Pete Swettenham, form a group with Alexander, who would play bass and sing. After the four-piece had assembled, The Beatles \u2013 having previously gotten to know Alexander through the Big Six \u2013 quickly took an interest. Lennon himself gave the group their fruity name, inspired by the title of a book by Yoko Ono. (The connection, however, was reportedly covered up, given he was still married to Cynthia Powell at the time.)\n\nDoran signed as the band\u2019s manager, and things got off to a roaring start. Speaking to Richard Porter, author of Guide to the Beatles\u2019 London, the Swettenham brothers recalled how Lennon and McCartney crashed Grapefruit\u2019s first recording session at IBC Studios, Portland Place, in 1967.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been recording for about half an hour when, on the stairs leading up to the control room, suddenly in walked John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who had been our heroes for years!\u201d said Geoff. \u201cWe\u2019d been drinking scotch and coke, and Paul asked for a drink. He took one sip and asked if there was any scotch in it. He then proceeded to fill the glass up with scotch and said, \u2018Now that\u2019s what I call a scotch and coke.\u2019\u201d\n\nFriends in high places: Grapefruit are presented to the media by John Lennon and other Sixties A-listers (Getty Images)\n\nFriends in high places: Grapefruit are presented to the media by John Lennon and other Sixties A-listers (Getty Images)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the year following that famed press conference of 1968, Lennon\u2019s interest in the band continued to grow, and Perry was invited to appear on The Beatles recording of \u201cHey Jude\u201d. He told It\u2019s Psychedelic Baby that McCartney had asked him to sing on the track unexpectedly during a visit to Trident, where the band were recording. \u201cI was, by this time, sitting on the floor downstairs at Trident, just watching this film-like event unfold before me with the four Beatles around the mic singing various parts, when the track got to the middle of the verse prior to the \u2018Better better\u2019 bit,\u201d said Perry.\n\n\u201cPaul McCartney suddenly looks over in my direction and ushers me over to join them, I look around to see who he\u2019s talking to and seeing only the wall behind me conclude quite brightly that he must be talking to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI get up and walk towards the mic, which John, Paul, George, and Ringo are standing around, and Paul McCartney once again gestures at some headphones lying on the floor. I reach down and put them on; they are so loud\u2026 I then, nervously, sang along with The Beatles, the first layer of \u2018Na Na Na\u2019s\u2019 going right to the end of the song.\u201d\n\nThat same year, Grapefruit supported the Bee Gees at the Royal Albert Hall \u2013 a second milestone in their fledgling career. Swettenham spoke fondly of their swift, brief rise to fame, telling Porter: \u201cOne day, me and Pete piled in a small car with Pattie Harrison, Twiggy, and Adrienne Posta and decided to visit our parents\u2019 pub in Chelmsford. Imagine the look on people\u2019s faces when we walked through the door, it caused quite a stir!\u201d\n\nOne day, me and Pete piled in a small car with Pattie Harrison, Twiggy, and Adrienne Posta and decided to visit our parents\u2019 pub in Chelmsford\n\nGeoff Swettenham\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the spring, Terry Melcher, who owned the record label Equinox in the US and was the son of Hollywood star Doris Day, was persuaded to produce Grapefruit\u2019s debut song \u201cDear Delilah\u201d. The track, which sounds a little like the love child of \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d and a church organ, peaked at No 21 in the UK singles chart. Lennon and McCartney took the band into the studio to record \u201cLullaby\u201d \u2013 a follow-up single originally called \u201cCircus Sgt Pepper\u201d in a nod to The Beatles\u2019 album that was released the year before.\n\nWhile that recording was never turned over to RCA, to whom their records had been licensed in the UK, other songs like \u201cElevator\u201d and \u201cYes\u201d were. They showcased the band\u2019s infatuation with their luminaries, taking cues from bands including the Beach Boys, which Perry and the Swettenhams had previously covered as part of the Castaways. McCartney even travelled with Grapefruit to Hyde Park to produce a three-minute promo film for \u201cElevator\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, the two-sided single failed to trouble the charts, inspiring the band to cover The Four Seasons\u2019 \u201cC\u2019mon Marianne\u201d instead \u2013 eventually reaching No 35. To this day, those three tracks show how their music was a clear replacement for The Beatles\u2019 earlier jangly sound, which had, by then, been replaced by a drug-fuelled psychedelia featuring sitars and rhythmic unpredictability.\n\nPremature endings: Grapefruit eventually split in late 1969 (PA)\n\nPremature endings: Grapefruit eventually split in late 1969 (PA)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut before Grapefruit could release more music, they were dropped by RCA. Mike O\u2019Connor, the new head of Apple Publishing, also released the group from their Apple contracts, forcing Doran to sign the band to the US record label Equinox, where Melcher produced and re-recorded the band\u2019s earlier songs for their first album, Around Grapefruit (1968), which met with little fanfare.\n\nEmbracing the similarities between the two bands, Derek Taylor, The Beatles\u2019 press officer, wrote in the LP\u2019s liner notes: \u201cThey are very gifted people, and we all smoke the same brand.\u201d Deep Water (1969), their second record, also flopped upon release after the group underwent a significant makeover, with Bob Wale replacing Pete Swettenham and Alexander opting for more of a soft rock sound as opposed to the melodic pop they had become known for.\n\nGrapefruit eventually split in late 1969. The late Geoff Swettenham continued to play music for fun, while Alexander joined his brother George and Harry Vanda from The Easybeats to record new music in 1970 before returning to Hamburg, where he died in 1997. Perry, meanwhile, became a supporting singer for Cliff Richard, with whom he worked and toured for more than 10 years. He then went on to collaborate with the likes of Elton John, Shakin\u2019 Stevens and Phil Everly.\n\nAll mod-rocker swagger and early promise, the photograph taken at that 1968 press conference is a reminder of what could have been for Grapefruit: a snapshot of a moment in time when they were on the precipice of something great. In the end, the band couldn\u2019t survive without the backing of Apple Corps \u2013 and their dissolution foreshadowed the breakup of The Beatles the following year.",

Next time, governor, why don\u2019t you say what you mean?\u201d the MAGA-favorite said.\n\nLast month, the governor filed a $787 million defamation lawsuit against Watters and Fox News, accusing Primetime of misleadingly editing a video of Trump to support the claim.\n\nJesse Watters reluctantly apologized for the claim he made about California Governor Gavin Newsom (Jesse Watters Primetime/X)\n\nJesse Watters reluctantly apologized for the claim he made about California Governor Gavin Newsom (Jesse Watters Primetime/X)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNewsom\u2019s attorneys said Watters aired a deceptively edited clip of Trump suggesting he spoke with the governor just before the president mobilized the U.S. Marines on June 9, when, in fact, records show the call occurred days earlier.\n\nNewsom\u2019s lawyers argued in the complaint that by making the call appear more recent, Trump could falsely imply he and the governor discussed the troop deployment to LA.\n\nThe governor, however, had already said publicly that he spoke to Trump after midnight on June 7, and the military was not discussed.\n\nTrump sent Fox News anchor John Roberts a screenshot showing the June 7 date of the phone call, but the image used on the show omitted the timestamp.\n\n\u201cGavin lied about Trump\u2019s call,\u201d the Fox News banner blared.\n\nGavin Newsom (left) and Donald Trump spoke on the phone on June 7 about the immigration protests erupting in Los Angeles (AP)\n\nGavin Newsom (left) and Donald Trump spoke on the phone on June 7 about the immigration protests erupting in Los Angeles (AP)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNewsom said they did not speak after June 7 and refuted the claim in a post on X.\n\n\u201cThere was no call,\u201d Newsom tweeted on June 10. \u201cNot even a voicemail.

        "text": "\n\n\n\nMartin Lewis has issued an \"urgent heads up\" to people heading on holiday this year, about \"potentially super cheap\" flights. The moneys saving expert often shares advice on several platforms, and social media is one of them.\n\nIn a video uploaded to his large Instagram following of 1.4m followers, Martin said: \"Dirt cheap flights for summer 2026. I know it's a long time away, but this is important because it all happens next Tuesday (July 22). What's going to happen is it's one of easyJet's quarterly flight launches.\n\n\"Now we always try to find out when they're happening, but we don't always get to. But we know this time.\" Martin added that easyJet has \"dynamic pricing\", this means the price of your flight depends on the demand at the time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: 'This is our Super Bowl or WrestleMania so everything has to be perfect'\n\nREAD MORE: Top 10 GP surgeries in Merseyside according to patients\n\nThis means if you manage to grab a flight the minute it is launched, there is no demand. The ITV star said: \"These flights are specifically for next summer, between June 15 2026 and September 13 2026.\n\nMartin says last year there were 10m UK flights available. The caption of the post read: \"Urgent: Super-cheap Easyjet Summer 2026 flights likely land next Tue. Get prepared NOW.\"\n\nThe money saving expert couldn't give an exact date for its launch, instead told viewers that from the past seats have dropped at 5am or 6am and other times it has been seen from 8am. Different flights to different places may also drop at times throughout the event.\n\nExplaining what to do if you really want to bag a cheaper flight, Martin said \"you're going to hate me for this\", before sharing \"you're probably going to want to be up at 5.30am in the morning and refreshing to see if they're available.\" However, he does warn that cheap seats being secured is not always guaranteed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\neasyJet describes itself as a \"low-cost, European, point-to-point airline.\" It travels to 164 airports in 38 countries and travels across 1,207 routes. The airline company recently revealed 22 new winter routes for passengers to enjoy in the festive season.\n\nAmong the new destinations for both flights and package holidays now available from the UK is Vienna in Austria, which easyJet will serve from the UK this winter.\n\nA service over the festive season will launch from London Gatwick, Bristol and Liverpool, from November 13, offering more city break options for holidaymakers looking to explore the home of one of Europe\u2019s most iconic Christmas markets.\n\nThree new routes are set to take off from Manchester, to Ljubljana in Slovenia as well as to Strasbourg in France and Verona in Italy, which will provide customers in the north west with more direct access to some of Europe's top ski resorts over the winter.\n\nCustomers in Liverpool also have even more choice this winter, with a new twice weekly service to Krak\u00f3w in Poland, while those seeking some winter sun can head to Almer\u00eda in Spain, known for its famous natural spots including the Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar park and the Tabernas Desert.",

        "text": "Diane Morgan went vegan a few months ago, so naturally, we meet for lunch at a restaurant in central London that almost entirely serves cheese. It is a humid, muggy day. \u201cYou don\u2019t often hear people use the word \u2018muggy\u2019 now,\u201d Morgan says, when I mention it. \u201cHow many people do you hear saying that, on a daily basis?\u201d A pause. \u201cUnder the age of 85, I mean.\u201d\n\nMorgan is famous for her deadpan style, which she has honed to perfection as the mockumentary host Philomena Cunk, and has put to use all over British TV, from the dour Liz in Motherland to Kath in Ricky Gervais\u2019s sitcom After Life, with a recent stint as the reporter Onya Doorstep in Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl. Over a lovely looking cheese-free salad, she admits that she is becoming more of a hippy as she gets older. \u201cAs I\u2019m cascading towards the grave,\u201d she laughs.\n\nMorgan is here to talk about the surreal, anarchic Mandy, which she created, writes and stars in. It is \u201cpure stupidity\u201d, she says, gleefully, ahead of its fourth series. \u201cThere\u2019s no meaning. You\u2019re not going to learn anything. I don\u2019t want to learn anything.\u201d The episodes are barely 15 minutes long, and see Mandy try out various jobs and get-rich-quick schemes, as she is forced to navigate fatbergs, psychics, illicit medical procedures, Russian gangsters and plane hijackings.\n\nBack in the day, Morgan and her friend Michael Spicer (\u201ca YouTube sensation now\u201d) would meet up at a pub \u2013 upstairs, in an empty room, not at the bar, she clarifies \u2013 with a bag of wigs, to play around with characters. One of them became Mandy. Mandy first made an appearance on Craig Cash\u2019s short-lived 2016 sitcom Rovers. When the BBC asked Morgan if she had any ideas for a new comedy, Mandy staged a comeback. They filmed a 15-minute pilot, in which Mandy covets a white leather sofa, leading to a Princess Di makeover that clashes with an experimental medical trial. \u201cI never thought they\u2019d pick it up, and I think that\u2019s why it was so mad,\u201d she says. \u201cI had the freedom to do whatever I wanted.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt went out in 2019, and was soon picked up for a full series. \u201cI thought, fantastic, made it, and then thought, oh shit.\u201d She was so nervous about it airing that she almost phoned the BBC and asked them to pull it. \u201cIt felt really personal, in some ways,\u201d she explains. In the new series, Mandy vomits ice-cream on to a small child\u2019s head and gets \u201crancid lamb fat\u201d injected into her backside. How personal are we talking? \u201cI felt like people were going to go, what the hell is that? And I\u2019m sure a lot of people did. It\u2019s just what I felt like doing at the time, as a reaction to all those Fleabaggy dramas. Fleabag\u2019s brilliant, but because it was so successful, there were loads of other shows that were a bit like that.\u201d\n\nMandy is not like that. Instead, it was inspired by more grotesque physical comedies such as Bottom. \u201cWhere they\u2019re just beating each other up repeatedly. I couldn\u2019t think of a woman that had done that.\u201d She wonders whether women don\u2019t want to make themselves look disgusting. \u201cI\u2019ve not got a problem with that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what I want to see.\u201d\n\nIn the first proper episode, Mandy gets a job in a banana factory, squashing spiders. I think about it every time I pick up a bunch at the supermarket. \u201cI was told that was an actual job in Bolton,\u201d she insists. \u201cThey would hand you a mallet and if the spider ran out, you\u2019d just clobber it. That was a job! Otherwise, what do you do? Just let them run free?\u201d\n\nMorgan has done quite a few of the jobs that Mandy tries, it turns out. \u201cChip shop, telesales, Avon lady, dental nurse, packing worming tablets. All kinds of stuff. I\u2019ve been pretty terrible at all of them.\u201d She grew up near Bolton, and had always wanted to act, but for a while, struggled to get into drama school. At one point, she and her friend Maxine Peake decided to have elocution lessons. \u201cWe thought the reason we weren\u2019t getting into drama school was because we were so broad,\u201d she says.\n\nHow did those lessons go? \u201cWell \u2026 badly,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut it\u2019s mad, isn\u2019t it, that the thing that was separating me out, I wanted to get rid of.\u201d She realised \u201cfar too late\u201d what made her special. \u201cI think it was when I\u2019d left drama school. I started doing standup, and then I started getting acting parts, and they were always miserable northerners.\u201d It finally occurred to her that what she had been trying to suppress was exactly what people found funny. \u201cThe flat, miserable noise of my voice.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMorgan has played Philomena Cunk for over a decade, and in the past, she has said that the two are very similar. \u201cBasically the same,\u201d she nods, today. But it sounds like there\u2019s more crossover with Mandy than you\u2019d think. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overlap there. I\u2019m probably more like Cunk, because Mandy\u2019s quite brazen. I haven\u2019t got [Cunk\u2019s] social skills, because I didn\u2019t go to public school. She doesn\u2019t care, whereas I do care. That\u2019s the big difference.\u201d\n\nShe will freely admit, though, that she loves an awkward moment. \u201cI\u2019m completely happy in silences, as you can probably tell from Cunk. I revel in them, almost.\u201d When she interviews experts for what looks like minutes on screen, she might have been talking to them for hours, waiting for the perfect response to the often mindless questions. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s an improvised conversation, because you never know when they might go, \u2018what do you think?\u2019\u201d She has to second guess what they might say, and work out where she might take it from there. \u201cIf they completely fall into the trap I\u2019ve set, it\u2019s like feeding strawberries to a donkey. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nPhilomena Cunk is unexpectedly massive in the US. \u201cOh my god, yeah, they love it.\u201d Morgan has done the rounds on the late night talk shows; she got a standing ovation when she walked out on to the Stephen Colbert stage. \u201cIt sounds ridiculous, saying it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI felt like one of the Beatles.\u201d Cunk is so big on social media that people don\u2019t always realise she\u2019s a character from a TV show. Sometimes, when they meet Morgan, they call her \u201cthe TikTok lady\u201d\n\nFrom 2016 to 2022, Morgan played Liz in the hectic parenting comedy Motherland. Have they asked her to be in its spinoff, Amandaland? \u201cNo.\u201d She leaves one of those perfect silences. \u201cBit awkward,\u201d she jokes. \u201cNo, I think it would be weird if we\u2019d all gone back into it, and called it Amandaland. It\u2019s a different show.\u201d She hasn\u2019t seen it, solely for the reason that she doesn\u2019t watch much comedy. \u201cIt feels too close to home. I can\u2019t switch my brain off from going, oh, I see what you did there. I just ruin it, because I can\u2019t enjoy things.\u201d She prefers documentaries. \u201cI find documentaries really funny, especially ones from the 70s. There\u2019s one that\u2019s purely about people who have got struck by lightning. It\u2019s just superb.\u201d\n\nSurely Philomena Cunk has ruined documentaries for everyone? \u201cBut they\u2019re still making them, exactly the same,\u201d she says. \u201cThey make shows and you think, this is exactly like Cunk! How can you do this?\u201d Morgan recently appeared on the celebrity genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, which was surreal for a number of reasons. First, because Mandy had already done a spoof of it called Who Are You, Do You Think, and second, because it is full of Cunk-like documentary tropes. Morgan leans into the daftness of it, doing those long, distant walking shots, and pleading not to have to look over her shoulder for the opening credits. \u201cMy mum said to my auntie, \u2018Diane\u2019s done Who Do You Think You Are, are you going to watch it?\u2019 And my auntie said, \u2018Depends what else is on\u2019. Swear to God. Depends what else is on. None of them give a shit. Keeps me very grounded.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMorgan loves Mandy\u2019s 15-minute episodes. \u201cYou\u2019re in, you\u2019re out, you\u2019ve got your life back. I don\u2019t want anything that\u2019s like, oh, this is 47 seasons and it doesn\u2019t get going until episode 16.\u201d But she will soon be returning to half-an-hour with Ann Droid, the new comedy she has written with Sarah Kendall. A year ago, Morgan read an article about the possibility of robot carers for child-free older people in Japan. \u201cI thought, I don\u2019t have any kids. Shit, that\u2019ll be me, ending up with a robot.\u201d It made her laugh so much that they sent the idea to the BBC, who said yes. \u201cThen we had to write it.\u201d Worse, she has cast herself as the robot. \u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to me that it would be difficult, over six weeks, to move like this,\u201d she says, lifting her arms stiffly. She is currently in training with a movement coach. \u201cI spend an hour a day, walking around the house like a robot.\u201d I can\u2019t believe your family don\u2019t care about what you do, I say. \u201cI know! They don\u2019t ask,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cNot bothered.\u201d\n\nMandy returns on Monday 21 July at 10pm on BBC Two.",
