        "text": "Most Australians are yet to feel the direct impact of the trade war between the United States\ufeff and China, which has seen US tariffs on Chinese imports spike from 10 per cent in February to 145 per cent in April.\ufeff\n\nThe same can't be said for some small business owners like Sophia Argyropoulos, director and designer of swimwear brand RAQ .\n\nLast week she was forced to shut down the brand's US website and pause all sales to the US as a result of \ufeffUS President Donald Trump\ufeff's skyrocketing tariffs, wiping out 20 per cent of RAQ's revenue in the process.\n\nSophia Argyropoulos is director and designer for RAQ, an Australian D cup+ swimwear brand. (Instagram/@raqapparel)\n\n\"You remove 20 per cent of your revenue that can mean you're not profiting at all,\" Argyropoulos told 9news.com.au.\n\nThough the brand is Australian owned and operated and all orders are shipped out of a warehouse in Melbourne, \ufeffRAQ's bikinis are manufactured in China and are therefore considered Chinese goods when being imported to the US.\n\nThat means that any orders \ufeffRAQ sends to the US are subjected to Trump's China tariffs.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nSo when he signed the first \ufeffexecutive order imposing 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods in February, Argyropoulos passed the fee on to US customers.\n\nThen, when the tariffs jumped to 20 per cent in March, she decided that RAQ would raise prices for US shoppers and absorb the cost of the tariffs.\n\nBut that tactic was not sustainable: When the tariffs skyrocketed\ufeff to 145\ufeff per cent on April 9 that meant a \ufeffRAQ bikini top priced at $95 would incur an additional $137.75 fee.\n\nAbsorbing the cost of 145 per cent import tariffs would wipe out the brand's revenue entirely and there's no way RAQ's US customers would be willing to pay an extra $140 on top of an almost $100 bikini top.\n\nRAQ used to ship about 20 per cent of its orders to the US. Trump's tariffs changed that. (Instagram/@raqapparel)\n\nArgyropoulos only saw one option for the brand.\n\n\"I made the call then and there to turn off our US website. We lost 20 per cent of our sales,\" she said.\n\n\"We're barely making a profit as it is, given the cost of living crisis and people not being able to spend as much, plus skyrocketing costs of running a business.\"\n\nBut closing RAQ's US website and pausing all US orders has raised new challenges for the small business.\n\nSwimwear is a seasonal industry and RAQ usually relies on orders from the US to get through the cooler winter months when Aussies aren't shopping for bikinis.\ufeff\n\nWith winter less than two months away, the tariffs that forced Argyropoulos to pull out of the US market couldn't have come at a worse time.\n\n\"Our business model relies on us pivoting to the US at this time of year to generate some cash flow to pay for our production for the next season in Australia,\" Argyropoulos said.\n\n\"So we're literally turning that tap off.\"\n\nCancelling the brand's US marketing helped her save some cash but it won't cover the cost of lost sales from the US market this winter, which could have a long-term impact on the business.\n\nArgyropoulos cancelled the brand's US advertising to try to recover some cash. (Instagram/@raqapparel)\n\nMoving manufacturing to Australia to get around Trump's China tariffs isn't an option either.\ufeff\n\nThe bikini tops \ufeffArgyropoulos designs are similar to bras and require specific technical skills to produce; technical skills which aren't currently available in Australia.\n\nIf she wanted to produce the same designs in Australia, she'd \ufeffhave to invest a fortune into setting up a factory, buying machinery and training a whole new labour force.\n\nIt's another cost she just can't afford as a small business owner.\n\nNot to mention that \ufeffArgyropoulos has a years-long working relationship with her Chinese manufacturer and doesn't want to put them out of work either.\n\nArgyropoulos fears the situation will only get worse in the coming months.\n\n\ufeffSmall businesses that manufacture products in China and rely on the US for the majority of their sales may not survive if Trump's tariffs remain as they are or continue to rise.\n\nArgyropoulos (second left) fears how losing the US market will affect her business in the long run. (Instagram/@raqapparel)\n\nRAQ's sales have not recovered since \ufeffArgyropoulos shut down the US website.\n\nNow she's turned her focus to breaking into the UK market and while she's hopeful it will help the brand get through winter, there are no guarantees.\ufeff\n\n\"You can't just turn that on overnight,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm trying to stay optimistic in that there are other markets out there, and I'm trying to focus on what I can control [but] I don't know if I can just create a market out of nothing.\"",

        "text": "On a warm, dry Adelaide afternoon Port Adelaide decided to put the \"foot\" part of football mostly to rest.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nIn one spectacular sequence the Power decided to move the ball down the ground by hand. Dodging and weaving through the defence, Port executed eight handballs, and just one kick prior to the goal.\n\nThe ball moved effortlessly from defensive 50 to their own arc without hitting the deck, with Sam Powell-Pepper's punctuating bounce setting the scene for Jason Horne-Francis's open goal.\n\nFor many this second quarter goal exemplifies what makes footy great. Dynamic movement, stellar skill and line-breaking speed.\n\nFor hours each week footballers across the league and country operate in lines, triangles and circles, honing their ability to get the ball away with speed and under pressure. The best in the game can get a handball away in a fraction of a second in almost any situation.\n\nBut for all the beauty of the handball, the codification and adoption of the skill is relatively recent when compared with the code's 167-year history. The handball as we know it today \u2014 with one clenched fist punching the ball from the other resting hand \u2014 has been the norm for less than half the sport's history.\n\nThe handball has radically evolved as the game has developed, now representing an essential skill for all players across all parts of the ground.\n\nThis is the story of the handball, and the brilliance of the skill today.\n\nThe first handballs\n\nThe first rules of the game in 1858 were clear about one thing \u2014 there was to be no throwing of the ball in the Australian code. But equally missing from the early rules was any mention of a handball or handpass.\n\nIt's likely that for the first 40 or so years of football history the handball was likely not a part of the game. One of the first \"instructional manuals\" for football, contained within Thomas Power's 1879 'The Footballer' said that \"the hand is very useful to strike back, forward or catch a ball in the air\u2026to stop a ball\u2026(or) to change the direction of it suddenly\u2026but beyond this its use should not be allowed to go\".\n\nInstead, early Australian Football often moved the ball via the \"little mark\" \u2014 a mark that went as little as inches to give a player a free kick.\n\nWhen the distance for the kick was set at 10 yards (about 9 metres) in 1897, players were forced to find another way to get rid of the ball when unable to kick. This is where the handpass came to the fore.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThe first recorded forms of the handball involved the ball being either tossed above the head and hit like a tennis serve or flicked well above the head.\n\nThe handball was first codified for the 1911 season, defined as \"when the ball is clearly held in one hand and knocked with the other hand\".\n\nThis interpretation allowed room for the \"flick\" pass to continue \u2014 where a ball was held with one hand and pushed out with an open hand.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThe flick pass was explicitly banned before the 1924 season, with only a clenched fist permitted from the 1925 season onwards.\n\nIn 1934 the rule was rolled back, stating that a handball is \"knocked with the other hand\". This caused more confusion across the nation. South Australia fully re-adopted the flick pass under this rule, while Victorian officials largely insisted on closed fists. Different leagues \u2014 big and small \u2014 often had different interpretations of the word \"knocked\". Interstate play was especially fraught.\n\nIn 1938 the VFA in Victoria went a step further and allowed throw passes in an effort to speed up the game, though reverted in 1949.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nBy the late 1940s and early 1950s many believed the flick pass was actually illegal, with the ANFC running statements reasserting that this was not the case. A more restricted flick pass re-emerged across the 1950s and continued to be legal until 1966, exemplified by players such as Ted Whitten.\n\nThrough most of this time the handball was considered a secondary weapon \u2014 only to be resorted to when the kick was not possible. Len Smith \u2014 brother of Demons great Norm \u2014 was a coaching pioneer of the use of the handball but even his coaching rules stated that a \"handball does not take the place of a kick. It is a means of getting out of trouble.\"\n\nThis approach continued right up until the 1980s, when the handball started to come into prominence as an attacking weapon as the game began to fully professionalise. As footballers became fitter, the need to utilise other methods than the kick and hope became necessary.\n\nThe modern handball\n\nThese days the handball isn't a weapon of last resort \u2014 it's a key part of any successful team's strategy. Those endless hours of handball drills have had a clear impact on the way that the modern game is played.\n\nThe two players with the most handballs on record at the top level are currently in the league, with Lachie Neale likely to grab the third spot by the end of the year. Just one of the top 20 for handballs retired before the year 2000 (Greg Williams), with the former Brownlow Medallist likely to fall outside this elite club before the end of the season.\n\nThe exit from stoppages has moved from dump kicks to smooth overlap handballs \u2014 with these exits semi-scripted and programmed in advance. Some teams \u2014 such as Hawthorn \u2014 thrive on backfeeding from contests. Others \u2014 such as GWS \u2014 look for overlap handballs from set positions or to utilise foot speed to beat static defences.\n\nTeams tend to handball most often in the heat of the centre of the ground, where the space to find smooth marking targets is rare. In defence there's also a tendency to use a couple of sets of hands in order to find a good kick, rather than dumping it out under pressure and risking an intercept mark.\n\nIt's the handballs through the middle that now open up the field of play for pinpoint kicks to be targeted inside forward 50.\n\nAllowing the long, flowing team chains to occur has been a continual development of the techniques around the handball. Much like the tennis slap of 1909 slowly evolved into the rocket handballs of the 1980s, the handball of 2025 utilises a variety of different skills and techniques to release the ball legally.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nOne of the most important developments over the year relates to the \"hold\" arm. Instead of the ball resting on the hand like players of yesteryear, players are taught to \"palm\" or firmly grip the ball to increase the range of possible release angles. This allows skills like Nick Daicos's \"backwards\" handball while still retaining control of the ball.\n\nPlayers are also becoming increasingly adept at adjusting the position of their \"hold\" arm to outside of their torso and tackle cylinder. Some players like to shift the ball to their outside arm and away from their body horizontally, while others such as Tom Green raise their arms up so they can get a handball away while their body is being tackled.\n\nThe skill of getting the ball away while falling to the ground is also critical, with double Brownlow Medallist Lachie Neale one of the finest at the art. The difference between an effective falling handball and getting trapped holding the ball can often be the difference between a goal and one conceded.\n\nAs teams have become more willing to attack via the handball, opposition sides have increasingly focused on blocking handball lanes with arms and bodies. The underground handball is one of the best tools to avoid these obstacles, as Steele Sidebottom demonstrates above.\n\nIt's not just technique that is forged in those endless handball drills, but also the connection between different players. Certain combinations crop up as common, building on well established rapport between teammates.\n\nAll Australians, Brownlow Medallists and stars of the game are littered on this list, underlining the importance of the handball to the game of the modern greats. That connection \u2014 tied with the technical and tactical advances \u2014 has helped the handball become such a useful tool.\n\nAs football continues to age, the importance of a well placed and executed handball continues to grow.",

        "text": "Photographing sticker art started as a hobby for Roni Hind, but when she'd accumulated more than 5,000 shots, she had to acknowledge that stickers had become her passion.\n\nAnd it was time to do something with it.\n\nInspired by sticker expos she'd heard about around the world, she founded the Sydney Sticker Expo, which she believes to be the first of its kind in Australia.\n\nHind, who curated and organised the expo of sticker art from Australia and across the world, is drawn to the democratic nature of sticker art.\n\n\"I really enjoy the accessibility of it,\" she says.\n\nA sticker placed somewhere is a sort of invitation for more, and overlapping, stickers to be added.\n\nSticker art, a sub-culture of street art, isn't always cheap to create, but Hind says there are ways to do it on a budget.\n\n\" Not everybody is able to go to art school, but they can still express their art through a sticker. \"\n\nFrom political messages and cheeky parodies of well-known logos, to cute animals and graffiti-style tags, there's a lot of ground being covered by Australia's sticker artists.\n\nMore than 150 artists from 13 countries submitted stickers to the expo.\n\nA subculture of street art, sticker art is democratic, accessible and born from a strong community of creators. (Supplied: Roni Hind)\n\nHind says the scene in Australia is thriving, though relatively small compared to countries like the United States and Germany.\n\nInspired by Banksy\n\nOne of the featured artists in the expo is Melbourne's Robbo-T, who has been creating stickers for about five years. His work often features an expressive silver robot exploring its environment.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nRobbo-T became interested in making stickers on a street art tour in Sydney, where he noticed a sticker from a well-known local artist.\n\n\"That was an 'a-ha' moment that opened my eyes to the whole sticker culture,\" he says.\n\nHe's inspired by Banksy's playful approach, and particularly the way the renowned street artist \"is able to interact with the world around him; his pieces interact with drain pipes and shop fronts\".\n\n\"There are a lot of big, plain, industrial-looking areas out there, and stickers are a way of bringing some of those to life and adding a little bit of interest to people's daily commutes,\" Robbo-T says.\n\nLike many sticker artists, he enthusiastically trades his work with other artists.\n\n\"You make connections locally and internationally,\" he explains.\n\n\"It's a unique sticker thing. People will send you their stickers that you'll put up in your region.\" (He was recently chuffed to hear one of his stickers was spotted in T\u00fcrkiye.)\n\nRobbo-T joined a group that meets monthly in Melbourne to do street art in laneways and he says he was \"dubious\" when the group first invited him.\n\n\"I'm a bit older, and I was expecting [the group members] to be the stereotypical kind of taggers,\" he says.\n\n\"But what I found was a group of artists of all different types and age groups. There was a mixture of photographers, people that did stencils, paste-ups [posters or paper art that is pasted on walls] and old-school graffiti artists who have been spraying their whole lives.\n\n\"It's a vibrant community.\"\n\nArtists living double lives\n\nSydney's Onnie O'Leary, also a prominent tattoo artist, branched out into stickers around 2021.\n\nHer work \u2014 both tattoos and stickers \u2014 is inspired by erotic comic books of the 1970s, and often depicts vividly coloured angels and demons.\n\nO'Leary branched out into stickers around 2021, initially giving her stickers to her tattoo clients as a promotional tool. (Supplied: Onnie O'Leary)\n\nShe says, like street art, sticker art appeals to creatives who want to keep their identity a secret.\n\nShe's had in-depth online conversations with other sticker makers without knowing their names.\n\n\"We're just going off handles. I don't know what gender they are or how old they are, but regardless of those things, we have these stickers in common and that becomes the generative spark for swapping and talking about art.\"\n\nHind enjoys the anonymity of the scene.\n\n\"That's kind of the excitement of it \u2026 everyone's almost got this double life. A lot of my friends don't even know that I take photos of street art.\"\n\n'Undercurrent of art and activity'\n\nSticker artists often paste their works in public spaces in a practice known as sticker slapping or sticker bombing. Certain areas can organically become home to a cluster of stickers.\n\n\"It tends to be contagious,\" O'Leary says.\n\n\"One person sees a sticker, then they put another one down, and then someone else comes along and adds to that, until there are layers and layers of overlapping history there.\"\n\nO'Leary found promoting her art work on social media was getting harder and harder. \"So I thought, 'What about the real world?'\" (Supplied: Onnie O'Leary)\n\nWhile she loves coming across stickers in the wild, O'Leary's looking forward to seeing this often guerilla art form in the expo's gallery space.\n\n\"Often, I think [sticker art] is looked at as graffiti \u2014 with a negative rather than artistic connotation.\"\n\nBut they're \"really beautiful\", she argues.\n\n\"I love that there's this undercurrent of art and activity that's happening just on the surface of the streets that a lot of people don't notice.\"\n\nThe Sydney Sticker Expo is at Goodspace Gallery on April 23.",

        "text": "Security fears have been raised after the prime minister was approached by alt-right protesters in the lobby of a Melbourne hotel he was staying in, a location that is meant to remain secret.\n\nA video circulating on social media shows two men confronting Anthony Albanese as he spoke with a staffer, yelling questions about the cost of housing before being moved on by the prime minister's security.\n\nGroups with far-right links \u2014 Melbourne Freedom Rally and Tactical Force Combatives \u2014 have taken credit for the videos.\n\nIt's not the first time the prime minister, Coalition leader Peter Dutton, or other senior politicians have been ambushed by protesters on the campaign trial, despite security detail being beefed up for the federal election campaign.\n\nAbout 10 events have been disrupted over the past few weeks \u2014 both Liberal and Labor \u2014 at locations from a brewery to a Chinese restaurant to a mental health clinic.\n\nEarly in the campaign, two climate activists yelled at the prime minister in a packed corridor in Maitland Hospital, in NSW's Hunter Valley.\n\nIt is understood they had gained access to the closed event filled with journalists, aides and medical staff, by posing as members of Mr Albanese's staff and providing those names to security.\n\nThe following day in Perth, at a battery wholesaler in the city's north, two protesters gatecrashed Treasurer Jim Chalmers' media event.\n\nThey had donned high-vis vests to blend into the crowd, masquerading as journalists.\n\nA climate protester holds up a sign at a brewery where Peter Dutton was speaking. (ABC News)\n\nNew 'guerilla tactics' being used\n\nWhile Australians may be accustomed to seeing politicians heckled on the street or larger demonstrations outside a closed event, this time around protesters have managed to get inside venues that have been kept under wraps \u2014 chosen and pre-vetted by politicians' staff.\n\nJosh Roose, a politics professor at Deakin University, said this required the use of \"guerilla tactics\".\n\n\"In order to get into a closed event, by definition, you're using some form of guerilla tactic like infiltration, disguise, using false accreditation, or hiding out,\" he said.\n\nDr Roose said while protest was normal and an important part of democracy, the tactics being used, such as \"bird-dogging\", were becoming more sophisticated.\n\nBird-dogging refers to activists hijacking politicians' media events to try to force an answer on questions they feel are being avoided.\n\n\"What we're seeing is Australian activists drawing on an international repertoire of tactics that have been developed, particularly in the US,\" he said.\n\n\"The key here though, is the danger of just one of those individuals demonstrating malevolent intent and a willingness to use violence.\n\n\"It only takes one individual to be successful and to slip through the net who's prepared to use violence.\"\n\nThe group behind many of the protests so far, climate action group The Rising Tide, told the ABC it's deeply committed to non-violence.\n\nPoliticians ramp up security\n\nSecurity measures have been beefed up around the high-profile figures this election campaign.\n\nDr Roose said that the threat of violence set against the \"highly polarised environment we're living in\" provides an enormous challenge for state and federal police and parliamentary security.\n\nIt comes after Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw warned on the eve of the election being called that federal politicians were facing increasingly menacing security risks, including threats to kill and threats of sexual violence.\n\nThe warning included advice for parliamentarians to protect their safety during the federal election campaign.\n\nProtester Alexa Stuart interrupts Anthony Albanese's press conference on Day 11 of the campaign. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\n\"Security is one of those things that's most effective when you don't see it,\" Dr Roose said.\n\n\"There's obviously not only the individuals on the ground, but there would be strong monitoring of what's going on online using open source intelligence.\n\n\"It's going to take more and more resources, particularly in the climate that we're in.\"\n\nHe said it was a difficult but important balance between acknowledging the role of protest in democracy, but also being alert to and tackling the threat.\n\nMr Albanese said he had confidence in the AFP and that protesters should not be encouraged by giving them attention.\n\nProtesters claim new tactics are necessary for their aim\n\nAlexa Stuart, an organiser for The Rising Tide group, said they wanted conversation focused on their message rather than their tactics, which they're keeping close to their chest.\n\nShe claimed the group uses publicly accessible information to enter events.\n\n\"We're sick of asking nicely and we're sick of being ignored,\" she said.\n\n\"That's the rationale behind this tactic. Major parties should be talking about climate they should be talking about their energy policies. We really want to force them to talk about it.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old made national headlines after crashing the prime minister's visit to a Headspace mental health clinic in Sydney's inner west earlier this week.\n\nShe did not comment on how she learnt about the location of the media conference. Asked how she got in, she told reporters: \"I was walking past.\"\n\nFears raised after report of alleged terror plot\n\nEvents away from the campaign trail have also heightened concerns.\n\nA report in The Australian suggested Mr Dutton was the target of a 16-year-old boy, who allegedly bought bomb-making ingredients in preparation for an attack last year.\n\nAfter the story emerged, the prime minister alleged he had also been the subject of \"a pretty serious incident\" which he said was \"before legal processes at the moment\".\n\nEarlier this week, more than 20 masked Neo-Nazi protesters dressed in black rallied outside Senator James Paterson's office, chanting racist slogans.\n\nSenator Paterson condemned the display, calling them losers.\n\n\"I certainly won't be lectured on patriotism from people who worship a failed foreign regime. These protesters only make me more determined to protect Australians from extremists of all stripes,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not remotely intimidated by cosplaying losers who hide their faces behind masks.\"\n\nThe AFP has developed election-specific security advice and established a taskforce, Operation AUSTRALIS25, to assess and respond to political threats.\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

The hosts came out flying, nearly taking the lead from a corner in an early flurry of attacks.\n\nHowever, PSG struck first blood in the 11th minute when Hakimi stroked the ball in after Villa's usually ultra-reliable goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez pushed it into his path.\n\nSixteen minutes later, Mendes curled in Villa's second goal off the post at the end of another fast-flowing counter-attack.\n\nTielemans's first-half goal appeared unlikely to swing the tie but it inspired Villa to storm out in the second half, with McGinn letting fly from outside the box to score in the 55th minute, helped by a small deflection.\n\nThen Konza struck Villa's third on the night after being set up with a brilliant dribble from Marcus Rashford.\n\nOne more goal would have put Villa level on aggregate but Donnarumma defied Rashford, Tielemans and then substitute Marco Asensio during a nerve-wracking finale.\n\nReuters",

He seized the initiative with early breaks in both sets and consolidated without conceding a single break point.\n\nIn contrast, Etcheverry, also beaten 6-1, 6-4 by De Minaur at the United Cup in Sydney in December, failed to convert two break points of his own. lt was all over in 82 minutes.\n\nDe Minaur last week signalled his clay-court intentions by scorching through to the last four at the Monte Carlo Masters, demolishing Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 6-2 in the last 16 before an astonishing 'double bagel' 6-0, 6-0 victory over Grigor Dimitrov gave him a semi-final berth.\n\nLooking set to become the first Australian since John Newcombe in 1969 to reach the final of the prestigious Masters 1000 event, he was only halted by in a near three-hour battle that ended in a tie-break defeat against Italy's Lorenzo Musetti, who fought back to win 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4).\n\nPerhaps the victory took a heavy toll for Musetti, who crumbled to a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 reverse at the hands of Carlos Alcaraz in the final 24 hours later.\n\nBack in Barcelona, De Minaur now faces Jacob Fearnley, the British number two who claimed his first ATP Tour main draw win on clay against Roberto Carballes Baena. The Scot, who made it into the main draw as a lucky loser, beat the Spaniard 6-1, 7-5 .\n\nFearnley was ranked outside the top 600 a year ago, but won four ATP Challenger titles in 2024 to rise inside the top 100.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia's Christopher O'Connell was edged out 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/3) by recent Marrakesh champion Luciano Darderi at the BMW Open in Munich.\n\nAAP",

(ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nA national concern\n\nAustralian Airports Association (AAA) chief executive Simon Westaway said he had heard similar concerns across the country on a recent tour of regional airports.\n\n\"A lot of these airports are council-run and owned, and the margins are finite,\" he said.\n\n\"Fifteen per cent of the overall Australian market for air travel is regional flying.\n\n\"The reality is if [costs] go up, they need to be managed.\"\n\nFormer senator and current SA Senate candidate for the Jacqui Lambie Network Rex Patrick said regional passengers paid significantly more per flight for security screening than their city counterparts.\n\n\"At Port Lincoln Airport, passengers pay about $15 per ticket, $45 at Whyalla, and, as will be the case soon, $90 per passenger at Mount Gambier,\" he said.\n\n\"Yet passengers in Sydney pay only 70 cents.\"\n\nRex Patrick (second from left) met with the Grant District Council to discuss the cost of security screening. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nImplementing the fee in Whyalla caused a significant drop in passengers, from 1,500 per week to 900 per week.\n\nRex Airlines also halted services to Whyalla.\n\nMr Whicker said a reduction in flights to Mount Gambier would impact a number of critical services for the region.\n\n\"We can attract teachers, doctors, nurses and allied health professionals from Melbourne and Adelaide,\" he said.\n\n\" An airport is just as valuable as a hospital, as education, and all those other services that regional communities rely on and enjoy. \"\n\nThe Whyalla airport experienced a drop in passengers when it added the cost of security screening. (Supplied: Whyalla City Council)\n\nProposal to share costs\n\nIf successful in the federal election, Mr Patrick and Senator Jacqui Lambie promised to introduce a bill to share the costs of security screening between all passengers in Australia.\n\n\"We need to have a regime in Australia where each passenger pays a levy for security screening costs, and that levy is used to fund the security screening costs all around the country,\" Mr Patrick said.\n\n\"What that means is people in Sydney who now pay 70 cents per passenger might have to pay a dollar.\n\n\"But it means that the people in Mount Gambier, instead of having to pay $90 will also only have to pay a dollar.\n\n\" It's a national security cost, it shouldn't be borne by local councils. \"\n\nMr Westaway said the AAA would push for more support for regional airports with the next federal parliament.\n\n\"We need to see a more sustainable commitment of funding to support both capital and operational requirements at our regional airfields,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Home Affairs said it worked with airport operators to ensure appropriate security measures were in place.\n\n\"Within the aviation security framework, airports and airlines are responsible for delivering aviation security requirements and managing day-to-day security operations, including the associated costs,\" they said.",

It\u2019s not about the CEO, it\u2019s not about the general manager. It\u2019s not about the coach, it\u2019s not about the trainer, it\u2019s not about the doctor, it\u2019s about what\u2019s in the best interest of the club, then the team, then the individual comes third.\n\n\u201cAnd with this one, with this statement, they\u2019re putting the individual first. Lachlan is putting himself first over the rest. I found that, firstly, extraordinary that that would be endorsed \u2013 and also that it is untenable, it can\u2019t go on. It\u2019s not going to last.\u201d\n\nGalvin will play at Lidcombe Oval on Easter Monday for Western Suburbs and it\u2019s unclear how long his demotion will last. Gould predicted the parties would have to cut ties early, and if that was Galvin\u2019s ultimate objective, it would come at a huge personal cost.\n\n\u201cIf in fact it was seen as strategy to create a situation where the club would let him go now, I don\u2019t think that they knew it would degenerate to this level, that within hours, the senior playing group would divorce themselves from his comments and divorce [themselves] from the young player and say we don\u2019t want to play with him,\u201d Gould said.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s terrible for a young player, to have the rest of the playing group say [that] \u2026 I think if it was a strategy being used to get him out of his contract in the short term so he can go somewhere next year, well then to that extent it\u2019s probably backfired to where it is at the moment.",

She\u2019s quick to clarify that the band skewed more towards the fun than the serious. \u201cI say this all the time, but we were no Jackson Five. We were just kids, do you know what I mean? But everyone we knew was making music, so we thought, well, why don\u2019t we get to do that?\u201d Her family is never far from her mind. I quickly learn that both her parents are excellent cooks, that her eldest daughter is following in her footsteps as a singer-songwriter, and that her husband, fellow musician Ben Rodgers, is also a skilled photographer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a massive family. There\u2019s lots of us. With my mum and dad, there\u2019s four of us, and I\u2019m the oldest of the four \u2013 but I\u2019ve got older half-siblings as well, who I\u2019m also close with, but didn\u2019t grow up in the same way with.\u201d Zaru soba noodles, seared tuna, bonito-infused aged soy. Credit: Jason South I don\u2019t know if Barnes would agree with my assessment of her as easygoing. Both she and her mother are eldest children, and she feels that there is a certain personality type that goes along with that. \u201cI take on a lot of responsibility, whether it\u2019s mine or not. I feel the need to manage all the situations. But really, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m a control freak,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI think that there was a lot of responsibility for me growing up with my siblings as well, just because of the way our lifestyle was. We\u2019re a very close family, so I\u2019m lucky \u2013 it\u2019s not a weight that I\u2019m unwilling to have.\u201d As we leisurely make our way through the different small dishes, Barnes makes it feel like she has all the time in the world when in reality her life is a careful juggling act of work, family and a collision of the two. She and her husband are raising two daughters aged eight and 15 while also touring regularly. As a musician, she performs solo and with her band, while also taking on projects like her current role. On days off from Jesus Christ Superstar she\u2019ll arrange gigs or work on other projects. I\u2019m just about to ask how she navigates all this when she says,\u201cI also manage my dad \u2013 but he works more than I do.\u201d Barnes worked as her father\u2019s tour manager for many years before slowly transitioning into her current role. \u201cIt was a gradual progression,\u201d she explains. It can be tricky, trying to navigate the personal and the professional. Mahalia Barnes as Mary Magdalene and Michael Paynter as Jesus in the Melbourne production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some moments that are testing. We get along very, very well, and I think that where it works in this role is that [my mum and dad] know that no one could possibly care more than I do as his child,\u201d she reflects. \u201cSome days when I have to tell them something they don\u2019t want to hear, that\u2019s always ... no one really wants to be told what to do by their child.\u201d Being family makes her both the most qualified and the least qualified she reflects. \u201cSo it\u2019s going well, but it\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s hard.\u201d And, she adds, with her eldest daughter now starting to release music, \u201csuddenly we\u2019re in a position where Ben and I are managing her too, essentially\u201d.\n\nIt seems fitting that Barnes explains how she navigates her intense schedule while also casually dissecting and serving out the flounder, something she makes look effortless, but which 10 minutes later I learn is far from the case. As I tentatively cut into it with a spoon she looks on with a quiet concern and I apologise for possibly mangling it. (\u201cNo, no,\u201d she reassures me. \u201cIt\u2019s just that that\u2019s the difficult part, because there\u2019s all the little bones\u201d.) The sauce that comes with the fish is a particular favourite \u2013 and one that she and her husband have (unsuccessfully, she adds) attempted to replicate at home. Food, she explains, is one of her love languages. \u201cFood and music.\u201d Whenever she can, she cooks for her friends and family. On the set of Jesus Christ Superstar on days when they are performing two shows she will duck out to find some kind of treat to bring back to share with everyone to boost morale and energy. The bill at Supernormal. Credit: Though she has been approached to take part in musicals previously, Jesus Christ Superstar is the first one she\u2019s said yes to. \u201cAs an artist, I would say I\u2019m more of a blues, soul, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll type singer. And part of what I love and am drawn to about that sort of music is the freedom of expression and the spontaneity and the improvisation and all of those things that maybe don\u2019t really fit into the musical theatre world.\u201d Barnes chose this musical because it resonated with her \u2013 partly because of the music itself and partly because as part concert, part theatrical production, it didn\u2019t hew too closely to more traditional musical theatre. She feels there\u2019s more flexibility in the story for musicians to express themselves.\n\nWith lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jesus Christ Superstar started as a concept album in 1970 and, following the success of the music, was developed into a Broadway production the following year. It tells the story of Jesus and Judas, with the narrative dissecting themes of fame, love, power and betrayal. Going into the musical, Barnes\u2019 initial read on her character was that \u201cit felt a little bit too passive, for my liking, a little bit too, I guess, gentle, a little bit weak\u201d. On paper, Mary Magdalene\u2019s role in the musical is a conciliatory one. She tends to Jesus and interrogates her own emotions. Barnes was keen to bring \u201ca little bit more strength\u201d to the role. \u201cI\u2019m not coming out there trying to change the character drastically, but just trying to maybe reinterpret and understand that the \u2018being gentle\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t have to equal weak.\u201d When I see the show a few days later, it\u2019s clear she has succeeded. Barnes\u2019 Mary is both calming and fierce, holding her own in the quiet battle between herself and Judas. Loading She points to the tension that runs through the story. \u201cMary\u2019s role is to come in and sort of settle that down a little bit and bring a little bit of calm to the group, to Jesus, and try and bring that to the community,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI mean literally I come in and say everything\u2019s all right, you know.\u201d",

During her appearance, she joked with the legendary late-night host that his dogs could tell if he had cancer. She was offered the spot after supporting O\u2019Brien at the State Theatre in Sydney. \u201cNothing happened, though.

It\u2019s her first stand-up show since 2022 and her first since becoming a mum. For a while, Lucas had doubts it would happen at all. The past year has not exactly been funny, she says. Becky Lucas performing at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2022. \u201cMy lovely little son was born with quite a complex heart defect that was picked up in utero, the 20-week scan. And so, my pregnancy, my first child, the journey was quite different. There\u2019s so much about it that was normal and joyful, but there was just a lot of terror and anxiety around it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2024, when George was five months old, he underwent five hours of open-heart surgery and spent 11 days recovering at the Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead. \u201cI was so sad and so scared that I just thought, \u2018Oh, I guess I can\u2019t ever do comedy again.\u2019 How can I marry these two parts of myself, like, being silly and irreverent, and then dealing with the heaviest, saddest thing possible?\u2019 \u201cThis show was written in the times when things were improving. And now, he\u2019s recovered fully, he\u2019s doing so well. I\u2019ll always worry, but life is pretty good. And returning to stand-up feels like things are normal again.\u201d Lucas\u2019 new show is not entirely about parenthood but, of course, it\u2019s a part of it. \u201cIt really does take a toll on your body. Having a kid is just being hunched over a bag and fiddling around with zips constantly. I\u2019m like the letter C.\u201d Oddly enough, Lucas has been thinking about motherhood since she was little. In her 2021 memoir, Acknowledgments, she recalls walking into rooms as a child and announcing that she loved kids but was not sure if she\u2019d be ready to have them. Her exasperated stepmum would reply: \u201cFor god\u2019s sake! You\u2019re seven years old!\u201d Lucas now realises that this obsession stemmed from her parents\u2019 divorce. \u201cMaybe I realised that I was a bit of a hindrance,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucas grew up on the mosquito-ridden Coochiemudlo Island, off Victoria Point in Moreton Bay. Her mum, Mandy, is a country music singer, and her dad, Timothy, is an inventor who created the puddle flange, now a standard feature in Australian bathroom drains. They split when Becky was two. She attended Brisbane State High, a selective public school she describes as \u201ca microcosm of the world\u201d, graduating three years after Matt Okine, with whom she later helped write the Stan series The Other Guy. (From left) Frank Woodley, Joel Creasey, Becky Lucas and Sam Simmons in the series LOL: Last One Laughing.

It quickly became crushingly obvious that the guy didn\u2019t really want her staying in his apartment and was avoiding her. Left to explore the city on her own, she found her way to The Purple Onion comedy club in North Beach. After the hit her self-esteem had taken, the idea of getting up on stage herself no longer seemed so scary. She made the finals of Raw Comedy in 2013, and from there, she was off and running. But Brisbane isn\u2019t the most welcoming environment for a young comedian. \u201cYou\u2019re doing some of the worst gigs in the country, like RSLs, pub gigs, gigs at truck stops on the side of the road.\u201d This is the origin of Lucas\u2019 style, which a Herald Sun reviewer accurately likened to \u201cputting a silencer on a gun: you don\u2019t hear the pearlers coming, you only know when they hit\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find many Brisbane comics telling long stories with a soft finish,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to pretend you\u2019re constantly performing next to a screen with dog racing, because you probably are.\u201d She was once paid to perform in broad daylight at a food court in a regional Queensland shopping centre, to a tiny and completely uninterested audience, as part of a Mexican food promotion.

I actually put a lot of Vegemite on my toast when I eat bread,\" the Prime Minister added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s a good thing. I did hear the report \u2014 it\u2019s rather odd they\u2019re allowing Marmite, which frankly, is rubbish. Let\u2019s be clear, I\u2019m pro-Vegemite, anti-Marmite. That\u2019s my position.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVegemite\u2019s British rival, Marmite, was granted approval by CFIA in 2020 despite the fact that an earlier shipment was blocked due to concerns about added vitamins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, Walters shared his disappointment over the CFIA\u2019s decision to remove approximately $8,000 worth of stock and ban the spread from the cafe's menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Despite Amazon and major grocery stores continuing to profit of the sale of Vegemite and similar products like Marmite, for some reason, our genuinely Australian/Canadian coffee shops offering a healthy slice of home away from home, is seemingly worth targeting,\" Walters said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking from a hospital bed while receiving treatment for spina bifida, a condition linked to folate deficiency at conception, he said Vegemite had a personal significance of Vegemite, which is fortified with folic acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Spina bifida exists because there's a lack of folate in the diet at conception.

        "text": "Sam (not his real name) worries about putting his life savings into an off-the-plan new home, fearing the risks involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's taken the 30-year-old at least two years of intentional saving to grow his deposit to around $30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canberra resident doesn't want to take any unnecessary risks when deciding on a property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know a few people have done it, but I feel like it's assuming a lot of risk in something that's already a big leap,\" he told SBS News of buying a new build.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said new policies released by the major parties for first home buyers \"hold some weight\" as he considers his vote ahead of the upcoming election, because it will directly influence the purchase of his first home.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, the Coalition unveiled its plan to allow first-home buyers access to tax-deductible interest payments on their first home \u2014 if they buy a newly built property.\n\n\n\nLabor also announced a plan in partnership with the states and territories aimed at getting people into newly built properties, saying it will spend $10 billion over eight years to build 100,000 new homes, exclusively for first-home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil told the ABC Insiders program that prices for the homes would be negotiated state by state, but the aim is to create affordable housing for low and middle-income earners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the South Australian example, we're building homes at that affordable entry level of the market, somewhere between $500 and $600,000,\" O'Neil said on Sunday morning.\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O\u2019Neil said the commonwealth will expedite the build of new homes and address the underlying supply issue. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Sam said he preferred Labor's proposal for 100,000 new homes because adding to supply might bring prices down.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he is still worried about the risks involved with buying off-the-plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said another problem is that new freestanding houses are often built on the outskirts of major cities where land is cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are far from workplaces and other opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Or you take a gamble on a new build apartment, which might get you closer to the CBD but [it's] still outrageously priced for a shoebox,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Plus it feels irresponsible to go that way with one\u2019s life savings [considering] the current trend in new build standards \u2014 look at the incident in Mascot a few years ago with that whole apartment block,\" he said about the Mascot Towers complex in Sydney that is now uninhabitable due to serious cracks that appeared in 2019.\n\n\n\nSam said he may also have to wait longer to move into a new build depending on how long it takes to construct, and faces the risk of paying rent at the same time as he's making repayments on a mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt raises the question, will the housing proposals appeal to the entry-level buyers it's targeting?\n\n\n\nAre we building the right homes?\n\nDr Liam Davies, a lecturer in Urban Planning and Sustainability at RMIT University, said the greatest challenge with Labor's policy is the lack of detail about what will be built and where.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Building more suburban housing in the urban fringes isn't overly helpful, that market is very well established,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said developers were also not delivering new homes that were suitable for families, including three or four-bedroom apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The moment those households want to look at having children, they also have to look at moving,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And you can't sell a flat in the inner city or middle suburbs and buy a townhouse or three-bedroom on a comparable income. You have to be moving further out.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia is building a million new homes \u2014 but we may not want to live in them\n\nHowever, Matthew Bowes from the Grattan Institute cautioned against this rhetoric, stating that a developer's business model relies on building homes that people are guaranteed to buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our family sizes are decreasing, and people want to economise on housing costs as house prices have risen, so it\u2019s not surprising to me that a lot of our newer housing stock has fewer bedrooms,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe suggested the best way to address housing choice is for state governments to unlock the planning laws that restrict building medium-density housing in these areas.\n\n\n\nAs the government focuses on ramping up new construction, it appears buyer sentiments towards new builds are changing too.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in three residential homes bought in 2023 were newly constructed, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) building activity data analysed by PropTrack.\n\n\n\n\n\nProptrack said several factors contributed to the trend, including the more affordable price of new builds, lower initial maintenance costs, the ability to tailor the home to buyers' specific needs, access to the latest technology and energy efficiency.\n\n\n\nQuality homes can restore consumer confidence\n\nMajor defects in new builds including Sydney's Mascot Towers and Opal Towers, in which residents were evacuated and faced expensive bills, have raised concerns in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer confidence in off-the-plan builds, particularly apartments, has also been rocked by media reports of gas explosions, water leaks, flammable cladding and fire safety issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nA NSW strata survey in 2023 found 53 per cent of buildings had serious defects in common property, but it found faults in newer buildings were on a downward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome home buyers have faced lengthy disputes and high-strata fees as they work with developers to correct the issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavies acknowledged the hesitation this has created in the new-build market.\n\n\n\nDefects in apartment buildings across the country have contributed to a crisis in confidence among first-home buyers. Source: Getty / Andrew Merry \"There is a certain amount of hesitation amongst buyers for buying off-the-plan because of building defects, but also because of changes the developers can make,\" Davies said, referring to changes made during construction that were not included in original plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think that any policy that a state government would be looking to introduce to become a producer of housing does need to provide confidence to those purchases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDavies said the way to restore first-home buyer confidence was through quality builds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government producing quality dwellings that people want to buy and want to live in \u2014 that is what will start to drive confidence in these types of schemes,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBowes added that both the NSW and Victorian governments had taken \"really positive\" steps to improve building regulations and ensure quality builds.\n\n\n\nIn March, the Victorian government introduced legislation to create a new building and plumbing watchdog to oversee aspects including regulation, insurance and dispute resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new regulator will have the power to stop the completion of off-the-plan sales for apartment buildings if serious defects aren't rectified.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill, which is yet to pass the upper house, includes a developer bond scheme. It will require builders to put aside a bond \u2014 2 per cent of the cost of construction \u2014 which can later be released to cover repairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the government aims to protect consumers and restore confidence, the Property Council of Australia has said the significant reforms have been rushed through and need adequate industry consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian changes mirror those made in NSW in 2023, to give inspectors the ability to stop construction while defects are investigated; a similar security scheme to use as insurance in case of building issues; and powers to immediately suspend building certifiers and practitioners.\n\n\n\nCan Australia build enough homes?\n\nIn August 2023, National Cabinet agreed on a target of building 1.2 million \"new, well-located homes\" across the country by 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government has faced scrutiny over whether this is possible, as it would require the industry to build around 240,000 homes a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHal Pawson is a professor of Housing Research and Policy at the UNSW City Futures Research Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says history shows the industry is capable of \"significant scale\", pointing to the booms of government-led construction after World War Two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were building homes for sale at cost price, and that was one of the key reasons why we saw a very rapid increase in the home ownership rate in Australia \u2026 in the 50s and 60s in particular,\" Pawson said.\n\n\n\nMore recently, a construction boost between 2015 and 2019 saw over one million residential units and houses built. This peaked in 2018 with the construction of 219,285 dwellings according to the ABS.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Neil is confident Labor's target can be met and cheaper homes built, especially with Commonwealth assistance helping buyers to gain access to land and shorten timelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of [the levers] is that we've got access to land that's available from state, local and federal government,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can also ask the states to do things like significantly truncate the timelines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

In this particular study we didn't see any differences between or kind of any different findings from these other ancestries. But this is probably just due to the fact that the sample size is much smaller. So one of the important kind of future work that needs to be done is looking more in other ancestries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings from an international research team led by Helmholtz Munich in Germany, and involving QIMR Berghofer scientists, have been published in Nature - a science newsletter available online.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study has identified more than 500 previously unknown genetic links to the disease, and hundreds of potential new drug targets that could fast track the development of more effective treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The study looks particularly at drug repurposing. This is the idea where instead of developing new drugs, you can use genetics to test whether you think current drugs would be useful in treating arthritis. So basically, we carried out screen and identified more than 270 approved drugs that could target protein that has been shown to be important in the disease. So this opens up these opportunities to repurpose drugs that can accelerate new treatments.]\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Lupton says factors such as age, environment, joint overuse, obesity, family history and genetics are among some of the significant factors they identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal Health Australia or MHA is a consumer focused organisation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey support those living with musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Jentz is the CEO at MHA. She says osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's around the joints. So think of things like your knee joints, your hip joints. So what happens is the cartilage starts to break down. The cartilage is important because it helps with movement, and it helps with us being able to do things like walk, run, bear weight. And osteoarthritis impacts the cartilage and breaks it down so it's hard when the bone is rubbing together and that's what causes the pain and disability.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Jentz says more than two million people in Australia suffer from osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Australia there are approximately 2.2 million people who are estimated to have osteoarthritis. And this is expected to increase certainly because we have an aging population here in Australia. But the other critical factor is that as our obesity level increase so does the prevalence of osteoarthritis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says osteoarthritis can affect anyone at any age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the increasing prevalence of obesity and overweight in Australia, osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases in Australia are actually starting to affect people at younger and younger ages.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Jentz commends the study saying MHA will take individualised treatment from that research.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Leticia Deveza is a rheumatologist based in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe deals with rheumatological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients are usually referred to her after seeing a doctor or a physiotherapist if their pain is not decreasing.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Deveza talks about the difference between osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Osteoarthritis is a joint disease affecting joints in the body - most commonly the hands, the spine, the knees and the hips. While osteoporosis is a disease of the bone metabolism that affects the quality of the bone - predisposes to fracture but is usually asymptomatic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found that the number of patients is predicted to increase to one billion by 2050, making osteoarthritis one of the fastest growing health conditions in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Genetic plays a very big role in osteoarthritis, we know that genetic studies that certain ethnicities are more proposed to getting osteoarthritis particularly the joint in the hips. But it's a disease that affects the population globally -- can affect all ranges. Genetic studies are important to identify the target for the development of the drugs trying to find a cure for osteoarthritis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers uncovered 513 new genetic associations linked to osteoarthritis, bringing the total number of known genetic links to 962.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also pinpointed eight biological processes involved in osteoarthritis development, providing further targets for therapeutic interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese processes include the circadian rhythm which is the body\u2019s internal clock, and glial cell functions which support the nervous system.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Lupton says her study talks about important disease pathways that may not have been previously looked at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One example is circadian rhythm which is our bodies internal clock that regulates sleeping pattern. And the study showed that circadian rhythm seems to have an effect on your rest that could be the disruptions of your circadian rhythm could affect your bones and joint tissues to repair. So that's kind of a new avenue of research that could lead to potentially new drugs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new insights into the genetic architecture of osteoarthritis could lead to more personalised treatment strategies and help improve the design of clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genome-wide association (GWAS) study is the largest ever performed for osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt analysed data from genetic samples donated by nearly two million people globally, including nearly 490,000 people diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe datasets included thousands of Australians who participated in other QIMR Berghofer-led studies, funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).\n\n\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal Health Australia CEO Helen Jentz urges anyone with questions related to musculoskeletal health to reach out to her team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a free national Healthline that anyone can ring and talk to a qualified healthcare professional about their musculoskeletal health or about their musculoskeletal diseases. And what we are very focused on is patients and consumer empowerment. So our focus is about providing people with the support and information that they need so that they can make informed decisions about how they manage their musculoskeletal health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Jentz says at MHA they are research and evidence based providing people with the right tools to make informed decisions about their nutrition, mental health and musculoskeletal health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the big campaigns that we run each year is called The World's Biggest Sit-In. And what that\u2019s about chair-based exercise. And it's a challenge to everyone to think differently about how they move and how they engage with physical activity. And a first step to doing that could be a chair-based workout. So, you can actually sit in a chair, move, build up a bit of a sweat, build up some cardio, but you're still engaging in movement which is good for your musculoskeletal health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Deveza talks about the importance of exercise and weight management in treating osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of the treating of osteoarthritis we highlight the importance of physical therapy, exercise therapy, and weight management because these are very important factors that drive the progression of the disease with the appropriate exercise program, with the weight management guided by your health professional patients help. Health professionals\u2019 symptoms can improve greatly in the majority of patients.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding that it's important to tailor the treatments accordingly to cater to each patient's capability.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "After being hit with steep tariffs by President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping is stepping up his diplomatic outreach in Southeast Asia, hoping to shore up economic alliances and position China as a more reliable trade partner than the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nXi's multi-country trip includes stops in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia \u2014 three nations negotiating with the US for lower tariffs on their exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, each country relies heavily on trade with China, leaving them to straddle a diplomatic line between two economic giants.\n\n\n\nWhat's Xi Jinping doing in the region?\n\nXi's first stop was in Vietnam, where he met with the country's top leader, To Lam. The pair announced dozens of new agreements and pledged deeper cooperation in supply chains, green technology, and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\"There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,\" Xi said in an article in Nhan Dan, the newspaper of Vietnam's Communist Party, ahead of his arrival on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina has invested heavily in Vietnam in recent years, especially as manufacturers have relocated from China to avoid earlier rounds of US tariffs during Trump's first term. Despite this, tensions persist between the two over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up, Xi will visit Malaysia, which regards China as one of their largest trading partners. Malaysia is also facing a 24 per cent reciprocal tariff from the US, slightly lower than Vietnam's 46 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his final stop, Xi will head to Cambodia, which has been hit with a whopping 49 per cent tariff by the US. Cambodia is a staunch Chinese ally with deep military ties and a Chinese-dominated manufacturing sector. Half of the factories in Cambodia are Chinese-owned, and the two countries have a free trade agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nXi last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How Australia could benefit from a US-China trade war\n\nWhat's behind the timing?\n\nXi's tour comes as China faces tariffs of up to 145 per cent from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid growing economic uncertainty, he is pitching China as a steady, long-term partner at a time when the US's trade policy looks unpredictable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Trump's trade war continues to rattle global markets, Xi is likely making a clear pitch: In uncertain times, it pays to bet on China.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It's been billed as a time-saver designed to cut down on paperwork, reduce reliance on professional tax advice, and a vehicle for cost-of-living relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf re-elected, Labor will let Australians claim an instant $1,000 tax deduction to cover work expenses, something Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says will \"provide more permanent cost of living relief and make tax time quicker and easier for 5.7 million taxpayers\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what do the experts think about Labor's proposed tax change?\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-income earners would benefit most\n\nMark Chapman, director of tax communications at H&R Block, says the proposal, which would come in from next year, would benefit lower-income earners the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It does hit the sweet spot between offering cost of living relief, simplifying the tax system for those on very low incomes and retaining the basic right to claim deductions for those on higher incomes, or with more complexity,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\"If you currently claim less than $1,000 in work-related expenses (for example, if you claim $100), you will be able to claim the full standard deduction of $1,000 \u2013 which is effectively a tax cut. This is bound to assist with cost of living pressures for low income earners \u2014 not by much, but every little bit helps.\"\n\n\n\nNot a 'substantial' cost of living relief measure\n\nDr Luke Hartigan from the University of Sydney's School of Economics says the initiative will reduce paperwork, but doubts it will significantly help reduce the cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think this is a good initiative and will help reduce some of the paperwork related to tax deductions,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Albanese\u2019s claims that this will lead to cost of living relief is reasonable, but on its own, the policy is not really a substantial cost of living relief measure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman said those on higher incomes or with more complicated tax returns wouldn't see as much benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Higher-income taxpayers generally have a broader range of deductions which total more than $1,000. I\u2019d say that this is targeted squarely at low and middle-income taxpayers (earning up to about $80,000),\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you claim more than $1,000 in work-related expenses, you simply carry on claiming your deductions as you do at the moment.\"\n\n\n\n2021/22 data from the Australian Taxation Office shows the average work-related expenses deduction was $2,506.\n\n\n\n\n\nHartigan agrees that those who claim less at tax time will benefit, estimating $205 of relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Around 5.7 million taxpayers who currently claim less than the $1,000 amount will benefit,\" Hartigan said. \"The average amount of annual tax relief for those who will benefit is estimated to be $205.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anyone who is earning less than $135,000 in 2026/27 will benefit from this policy.\"\n\n\n\nTime is money, says consumer advocate\n\nWhile the tax deduction may not solve the cost of living crisis, Sally Tindall from financial comparison site Canstar, says consumers may gain time back as they step away from an \"overly complicated\" tax system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cost-of-living crisis has put plenty of family budgets under extreme pressure, however, many of these households are often under time pressures as well. Money might not be of abundance, but often time isn\u2019t either,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Millions of Australians may find they start claiming more on their tax returns, up to the $1,000 threshold, while others, who might have slightly more than a $1,000 in claimable expenses could decide to ditch the collecting and tallying up of receipts in favour of ticking a box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Life is too short to be chasing after receipts, particularly for those with minimal work-related expenses. This move will help millions of Australians submit their tax returns faster and more efficiently.\"\n\n\n\nTaxpayers urged to approach with caution\n\nOther experts say that while the instant deduction could save people time, it might also mean taxpayers miss out on some much-needed funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taxpayers should be encouraged to take greater responsibility for their finances and tax obligations,\" CPA Australia tax lead Jenny Wong told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Clicking a few buttons to get a basic deduction may be easy, but it is unlikely to be in the best interests of taxpayers or the economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the initiative says taxpayers can claim their $1,000 without any receipts, Chapman urges Australians to still keep their receipts in case their work expenses turn out to be over $1,000.\n\n\n\n'Minimalist' take on tax reform\n\nChapman says the initiative is a \"minimalist\" take on a policy spoken about off the back of the 2009 Henry tax review, which prompted calls for a $3,000 annual standard tax deduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This idea has been talked about for a long time,\" Chapman explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is very much a minimalist take on the policy \u2014 $1,000 is not a huge amount. I've seen figures as high as $3,000 suggested in other iterations of the policy in the past.\"\n\n\n\nSteven Hamilton is an economics professor at George Washington University in the US. He said Labor's proposal would save the tax office and people money, in addition to moving to a system where no one has to itemise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ATO has to spend a lot of money policing those deductions, and it's just simpler for everybody,\" he told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a great example of how making our tax system simpler and more straightforward can lift a big weight off of the economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith additional reporting by Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s not about the CEO, it\u2019s not about the general manager. It\u2019s not about the coach, it\u2019s not about the trainer, it\u2019s not about the doctor, it\u2019s about what\u2019s in the best interest of the club, then the team, then the individual comes third.\n\n\u201cAnd with this one, with this statement, they\u2019re putting the individual first. Lachlan is putting himself first over the rest. I found that, firstly, extraordinary that that would be endorsed \u2013 and also that it is untenable, it can\u2019t go on. It\u2019s not going to last.\u201d\n\nGalvin will play at Lidcombe Oval on Easter Monday for Western Suburbs and it\u2019s unclear how long his demotion will last. Gould predicted the parties would have to cut ties early, and if that was Galvin\u2019s ultimate objective, it would come at a huge personal cost.\n\n\u201cIf in fact it was seen as strategy to create a situation where the club would let him go now, I don\u2019t think that they knew it would degenerate to this level, that within hours, the senior playing group would divorce themselves from his comments and divorce [themselves] from the young player and say we don\u2019t want to play with him,\u201d Gould said.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s terrible for a young player, to have the rest of the playing group say [that] \u2026 I think if it was a strategy being used to get him out of his contract in the short term so he can go somewhere next year, well then to that extent it\u2019s probably backfired to where it is at the moment.",

He\u2019s got verve in his swerve, Veuve in his make-up. He plays champagne rugby league that is a joy to watch!\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Marshall is now Galvin\u2019s coach, and despite the Tigers recently tabling a $5.5 million offer for five years of the young man\u2019s services, Galvin quietly declined. He did not loudly decline. He quietly declined. All the noise since has come from Tigers management and players. It is understood that the reason for Galvin declining to sign the contract is not because he wants more money, necessarily, but because he thinks he might become a better player under another coach, and that Marshall is not necessarily his kind of coach.",

        "text": "It was around this age that she and her younger siblings started performing more formally \u2013 first with their father, then as a group called the Tin Lids. She\u2019s quick to clarify that the band skewed more towards the fun than the serious. \u201cI say this all the time, but we were no Jackson Five. We were just kids, do you know what I mean? But everyone we knew was making music, so we thought, well, why don\u2019t we get to do that?\u201d Her family is never far from her mind. I quickly learn that both her parents are excellent cooks, that her eldest daughter is following in her footsteps as a singer-songwriter, and that her husband, fellow musician Ben Rodgers, is also a skilled photographer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a massive family. There\u2019s lots of us. With my mum and dad, there\u2019s four of us, and I\u2019m the oldest of the four \u2013 but I\u2019ve got older half-siblings as well, who I\u2019m also close with, but didn\u2019t grow up in the same way with.\u201d Zaru soba noodles, seared tuna, bonito-infused aged soy. Credit: Jason South I don\u2019t know if Barnes would agree with my assessment of her as easygoing. Both she and her mother are eldest children, and she feels that there is a certain personality type that goes along with that. \u201cI take on a lot of responsibility, whether it\u2019s mine or not. I feel the need to manage all the situations. But really, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m a control freak,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI think that there was a lot of responsibility for me growing up with my siblings as well, just because of the way our lifestyle was. We\u2019re a very close family, so I\u2019m lucky \u2013 it\u2019s not a weight that I\u2019m unwilling to have.\u201d As we leisurely make our way through the different small dishes, Barnes makes it feel like she has all the time in the world when in reality her life is a careful juggling act of work, family and a collision of the two. She and her husband are raising two daughters aged eight and 15 while also touring regularly. As a musician, she performs solo and with her band, while also taking on projects like her current role. On days off from Jesus Christ Superstar she\u2019ll arrange gigs or work on other projects. I\u2019m just about to ask how she navigates all this when she says,\u201cI also manage my dad \u2013 but he works more than I do.\u201d Barnes worked as her father\u2019s tour manager for many years before slowly transitioning into her current role. \u201cIt was a gradual progression,\u201d she explains. It can be tricky, trying to navigate the personal and the professional. Mahalia Barnes as Mary Magdalene and Michael Paynter as Jesus in the Melbourne production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some moments that are testing. We get along very, very well, and I think that where it works in this role is that [my mum and dad] know that no one could possibly care more than I do as his child,\u201d she reflects. \u201cSome days when I have to tell them something they don\u2019t want to hear, that\u2019s always ... no one really wants to be told what to do by their child.\u201d Being family makes her both the most qualified and the least qualified she reflects. \u201cSo it\u2019s going well, but it\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s hard.\u201d And, she adds, with her eldest daughter now starting to release music, \u201csuddenly we\u2019re in a position where Ben and I are managing her too, essentially\u201d.\n\nIt seems fitting that Barnes explains how she navigates her intense schedule while also casually dissecting and serving out the flounder, something she makes look effortless, but which 10 minutes later I learn is far from the case. As I tentatively cut into it with a spoon she looks on with a quiet concern and I apologise for possibly mangling it. (\u201cNo, no,\u201d she reassures me. \u201cIt\u2019s just that that\u2019s the difficult part, because there\u2019s all the little bones\u201d.) The sauce that comes with the fish is a particular favourite \u2013 and one that she and her husband have (unsuccessfully, she adds) attempted to replicate at home. Food, she explains, is one of her love languages. \u201cFood and music.\u201d Whenever she can, she cooks for her friends and family. On the set of Jesus Christ Superstar on days when they are performing two shows she will duck out to find some kind of treat to bring back to share with everyone to boost morale and energy. The bill at Supernormal. Credit: Though she has been approached to take part in musicals previously, Jesus Christ Superstar is the first one she\u2019s said yes to. \u201cAs an artist, I would say I\u2019m more of a blues, soul, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll type singer. And part of what I love and am drawn to about that sort of music is the freedom of expression and the spontaneity and the improvisation and all of those things that maybe don\u2019t really fit into the musical theatre world.\u201d Barnes chose this musical because it resonated with her \u2013 partly because of the music itself and partly because as part concert, part theatrical production, it didn\u2019t hew too closely to more traditional musical theatre. She feels there\u2019s more flexibility in the story for musicians to express themselves.\n\nWith lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jesus Christ Superstar started as a concept album in 1970 and, following the success of the music, was developed into a Broadway production the following year. It tells the story of Jesus and Judas, with the narrative dissecting themes of fame, love, power and betrayal. Going into the musical, Barnes\u2019 initial read on her character was that \u201cit felt a little bit too passive, for my liking, a little bit too, I guess, gentle, a little bit weak\u201d. On paper, Mary Magdalene\u2019s role in the musical is a conciliatory one. She tends to Jesus and interrogates her own emotions. Barnes was keen to bring \u201ca little bit more strength\u201d to the role. \u201cI\u2019m not coming out there trying to change the character drastically, but just trying to maybe reinterpret and understand that the \u2018being gentle\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t have to equal weak.\u201d When I see the show a few days later, it\u2019s clear she has succeeded. Barnes\u2019 Mary is both calming and fierce, holding her own in the quiet battle between herself and Judas. Loading She points to the tension that runs through the story. \u201cMary\u2019s role is to come in and sort of settle that down a little bit and bring a little bit of calm to the group, to Jesus, and try and bring that to the community,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI mean literally I come in and say everything\u2019s all right, you know.\u201d",

If you check out the details for her upcoming shows, you\u2019ll find her phone number listed in her artist blurb, along with an invitation to text her and ask her to \u201csay something funny\u201d. Lucas came up with the idea because, with a new baby, George, keeping her so busy, she didn\u2019t have the time to write the usual funny bio. Instead, she thought punters could decide whether to see her based on her witty replies. What could possibly go wrong? The number, for a start. Becky Lucas worried that she might not be able to perform stand-up again after her son was born with a heart condition. Credit: James Brickwood \u201cSome poor woman in the Blue Mountains called Mary started receiving hundreds of text messages from people saying, \u2018Tell me something funny\u2019. I gave her a nervous breakdown, I think. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s fixed now, so you can text me, but I have to say, it\u2019s quite a huge job to be texting a bunch of people back.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI really should have just written the bio.\u201d Although her nervous manager urged Lucas to get a burner phone for the exercise, she hasn\u2019t been trolled on the number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t received any vitriolic text, which I think means I\u2019m, you know, not famous enough.\u201d But Brisbane-born Lucas has been a professional stand-up for over a dozen years, hosted the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala, and delivered an insouciant five-minute set on Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s show in 2019. During her appearance, she joked with the legendary late-night host that his dogs could tell if he had cancer. She was offered the spot after supporting O\u2019Brien at the State Theatre in Sydney. \u201cNothing happened, though. You know, back in the day, you\u2019d do well on late night TV, and then you\u2019d have the whole world at your fingertips, but these days, everyone\u2019s a star.\u201d We\u2019re chatting ahead of Lucas\u2019 new tour, titled Things Have Changed, but the Essence Remains. It\u2019s her first stand-up show since 2022 and her first since becoming a mum. For a while, Lucas had doubts it would happen at all. The past year has not exactly been funny, she says. Becky Lucas performing at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2022. \u201cMy lovely little son was born with quite a complex heart defect that was picked up in utero, the 20-week scan. And so, my pregnancy, my first child, the journey was quite different. There\u2019s so much about it that was normal and joyful, but there was just a lot of terror and anxiety around it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2024, when George was five months old, he underwent five hours of open-heart surgery and spent 11 days recovering at the Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead. \u201cI was so sad and so scared that I just thought, \u2018Oh, I guess I can\u2019t ever do comedy again.\u2019 How can I marry these two parts of myself, like, being silly and irreverent, and then dealing with the heaviest, saddest thing possible?\u2019 \u201cThis show was written in the times when things were improving. And now, he\u2019s recovered fully, he\u2019s doing so well. I\u2019ll always worry, but life is pretty good. And returning to stand-up feels like things are normal again.\u201d Lucas\u2019 new show is not entirely about parenthood but, of course, it\u2019s a part of it. \u201cIt really does take a toll on your body. Having a kid is just being hunched over a bag and fiddling around with zips constantly. I\u2019m like the letter C.\u201d Oddly enough, Lucas has been thinking about motherhood since she was little. In her 2021 memoir, Acknowledgments, she recalls walking into rooms as a child and announcing that she loved kids but was not sure if she\u2019d be ready to have them. Her exasperated stepmum would reply: \u201cFor god\u2019s sake! You\u2019re seven years old!\u201d Lucas now realises that this obsession stemmed from her parents\u2019 divorce. \u201cMaybe I realised that I was a bit of a hindrance,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucas grew up on the mosquito-ridden Coochiemudlo Island, off Victoria Point in Moreton Bay. Her mum, Mandy, is a country music singer, and her dad, Timothy, is an inventor who created the puddle flange, now a standard feature in Australian bathroom drains. They split when Becky was two. She attended Brisbane State High, a selective public school she describes as \u201ca microcosm of the world\u201d, graduating three years after Matt Okine, with whom she later helped write the Stan series The Other Guy. (From left) Frank Woodley, Joel Creasey, Becky Lucas and Sam Simmons in the series LOL: Last One Laughing. Credit: Amazon Prime Video The stand-up penny dropped for her during a visit to San Francisco, where she stayed with an American flame from an earlier backpacking trip to Brazil. It quickly became crushingly obvious that the guy didn\u2019t really want her staying in his apartment and was avoiding her. Left to explore the city on her own, she found her way to The Purple Onion comedy club in North Beach. After the hit her self-esteem had taken, the idea of getting up on stage herself no longer seemed so scary. She made the finals of Raw Comedy in 2013, and from there, she was off and running. But Brisbane isn\u2019t the most welcoming environment for a young comedian. \u201cYou\u2019re doing some of the worst gigs in the country, like RSLs, pub gigs, gigs at truck stops on the side of the road.\u201d This is the origin of Lucas\u2019 style, which a Herald Sun reviewer accurately likened to \u201cputting a silencer on a gun: you don\u2019t hear the pearlers coming, you only know when they hit\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find many Brisbane comics telling long stories with a soft finish,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to pretend you\u2019re constantly performing next to a screen with dog racing, because you probably are.\u201d She was once paid to perform in broad daylight at a food court in a regional Queensland shopping centre, to a tiny and completely uninterested audience, as part of a Mexican food promotion. It lasted two minutes before the franchisee gently escorted her off. Becky Lucas says motherhood is the \u201cmost beautiful, meaningful thing I\u2019ve ever done\u201d. Credit: James Brickwood In 2013, at 24, she moved to Sydney and bonded with the Brisbane wave of comedians: Okine, Mel Buttle, Sam Campbell, Damien Power, and Josh Thomas. Before The Other Guy, she contributed to two seasons of Thomas\u2019 show Please Like Me, working in the writers\u2019 room to punch up scripts and make the other writers laugh. Loading Not everything she writes does so well. In 2018 Lucas was banned from Twitter for drunk-tweeting that she would behead then-prime minister Scott Morrison. \u201cIt\u2019s something I always say to people,\u201d she said at the time. \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to chop your head off!\u2019 It\u2019s a joke. I say it to my friends.\u201d She now thinks her account might have been reinstated because Elon Musk doesn\u2019t care. But she can\u2019t remember her username. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being able to log back on, but I also think, why would I want to introduce that back into my life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service\n\nA stunning new four-day, 42km hike has opened in the Tweed Byron Hinterland, taking explorers through a volcanic landscape covered in rainforest, clear creeks and waterfalls. But unlike most national park walks in NSW, the Gidjuum Gulganyi Walk comes with a hefty fee, leading hikers to debate how much they would pay for the multi-day trek.\n\nThe trail is rated as a grade 4 hike, where adventurers would be walking between four and nine hours per day, at times covering steep and uneven ground. For those who are keen to explore it alone with their own equipment, there is a price tag of $173 to camp along the trail \u2013 with each site holding up to two people.\n\nThe campsites include raised wooden platforms that can either hold two small tents, or one medium sized tent. Also at each of the campgrounds are non-flush toilets, picnic tables, shelters and rainwater tanks.\n\nWhile the announcement of the hike itself had Aussies excited, many felt the cost was almost as steep as the terrain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"To pay almost $200 for a national park hike is cooked!\" one man wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"So bloody expensive,\" another agreed.\n\nThe impressive new track has sparked heated discussion about the prices of the guided and self-guided tours. Source: NSW National Parks\n\nGuided tours available for over $3,000\n\nFor those looking for a guided tour, the prices skyrocket even further.\n\nOne company offers a \"luxurious\" guided walk where your bags are transported for you, meaning you only have to carry a light day pack. The experience includes chef-prepared meals, hot showers, \"comfy sleeping cots\", solar USB chargers and even wine in the evenings, and will set you back $3,200 per person, twin share. Single occupancy has a higher charge.\n\nOne man noted that it's cheaper to get a guided tour of Mount Everest \u2013 and he\u2019s right. A 15-day trek over glaciers and valleys to base camp on Everest, including transfers and accommodation, is currently on offer for $1,684.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Cheaper to go hiking in another country, which is crazy. Come on Australia we can do better,\" one person wrote.\n\nBushwalking community shocked at 'exorbitant' fees\n\nKirsten Mayer, executive officer of Bushwalking NSW, told Yahoo she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the charges, saying the high prices will mean the full walk will not be accessible for all Australians.\n\n\"This high cost of camp sites is likely to reduce the engagement in national parks by people of a lower income, and what are they doing about that? Because these are public assets and everybody should be included and given access,\" she said.\n\n\"$173 for three nights camping in a national park is a very steep ask.\n\n\"We do not fully support expensive campgrounds and we certainly don\u2019t support broadened manufactured walking tracks that don\u2019t allow people to connect with nature, because we vitally need that.\"\n\nNational Parks explains the reason behind $173 fee\n\nA spokesperson for NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service explained there are \"higher operational costs\" involved with the trail due to its remote location.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There is no fee for walking on the track but staying three nights in the campgrounds along the track costs $172.80 for up to 2 people. That is about $28.80 per person, per night twin share,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThere are three campgrounds along the trail, each with hardwood platforms for tents. Source: NSW National Parks\n\n\"These new campgrounds have been carefully designed to balance visitor comfort while protecting the surrounding environment. Their remote locations mean they require higher operational costs, including waste removal and ongoing servicing to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.\n\n\"All visitor fees are reinvested directly into the management of national parks, helping to maintain tracks, campgrounds, signage, and conservation programs.\"\n\nThe walk is part of the $7.34 million Tweed Byron Hinterland Trails project, and includes shorter day walks that visitors can enjoy for free, the spokesperson added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor those interested in checking out the Gidjuum Gulganyi, check out the different options here.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
