        "text": "A member of the Trump administration has seemingly raised a red flag after China bought millions of tons of Argentinian soybeans, taking advantage of a financial lifeline the US Treasury Department said it plans to provide to Buenos Aires \u2013 all while American soybean farmers are struggling with a Chinese blockade of their crops.\n\nA photo of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's phone captured by the Associated Press shows a text from a contact named \"BR,\" presumed to be US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.\n\nThe message linked to the X account of grain trader Ben Scholl, who has sounded the alarm on what Argentina's massive bailout means for America's soybean farmers.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent checks a text message regarding Argentina relations with the United States. (Angelina Katsanis/AP via CNN)\n\n\"Just a heads up. I am getting more intel, but this is highly unfortunate. We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return, the Argentine's (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\" the message said.\n\n\"Soy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us. On a plane but scott I can call you when I land.\"\n\nAdministration officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe caught-on-camera text conversation appears to show how President Donald Trump's haphazard foreign policy agenda has produced a number of unintended negative consequences for American farmers \u2013 a situation Trump has acknowledged by suggesting his administration may take action to help bail them out.\n\nREAD MORE: Nicole Kidman officially files for divorce from Keith Urban\n\nUnited States Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, second from left, attends the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 23. (Yuki Iwamura/AP via CNN)\n\n\"There's no doubt that the farm economy is in a significant challenge right now, especially our row croppers,\" Rollins told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"The ability to offset any payments to the farmers through potential tariff revenue is really where the president wants us to head, and that's what we're looking at.\"\n\nA strategic friendship that is hurting US farmers\n\nSince taking power in 2023, Argentina's President Javier Milei has overhauled the country's spending and regulations.\n\nThat has resulted in some success, such as monthly inflation slowing from over 25 per cent to around 2 per cent.\n\nBut other corners of the Argentine economy are languishing, and the president's party got trounced in local elections earlier this month.\n\nMilei has a powerful friend in Trump, who has praised the chainsaw-wielding libertarian and endorsed his re-election at the United Nations last week, saying: \"To the people of Argentina, we're backing him 100 per cent.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has said it is arranging a US$20 billion ($30.25 billion) lifeline to Argentina's central bank, which would exchange US dollars for pesos to help stabilise Argentina's financial market.\n\nREAD MORE: Brisbane doctor revealed as mother found dead alongside daughter\n\nThe US soy crop has been left out of Chinese imports. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBessent said the deal would function as a \"bridge to the election,\" thereby allowing Milei to continue with his radical reforms.\n\nBut after Argentina temporarily rolled back its export tax on grain in the hopes of juicing sales, China snapped up \"at least 10 cargoes of Argentine soybeans,\" according to reporting from Reuters.\n\nThe move has further complicated America's trade relationship with China: once the largest buyer of American soybeans \u2013 Beijing bought $US12.5 billion ($18.91 billion) worth last year \u2013 USDA data shows it has not purchased any US soybeans since May, amid a trade spat with Washington.\n\nArgentina President Javier Milei. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\nThe situation has hobbled America's $US60.7 billion ($91.81 billion) soybean industry, and there seems to be no concrete solution in sight without a trade deal and China reconfiguring its soybean supply chain.\n\n\"US soybean farmers have been clear for months: the administration needs to secure a trade deal with China. China is the world's largest soybean customer and typically our top export market,\" American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a September 24 statement.\n\n\"The US has made zero sales to China in this new crop marketing year due to 20 per cent retaliatory tariffs imposed by China in response to US tariffs.\"\n\nTrump last Thursday at the White House suggested that his administration may distribute some tariff revenue to American farmers on a temporary basis to help alleviate their financial strain from his policies.\n\n\"We're going to take some of that tariff money that we've made, we're going to give it to our farmers, who are \u2013 for a little while \u2013 going to be hurt until it kicks in, the tariffs kick in to their benefit,\" Trump said.\n\nIt's the latest frustration for American farmers as they start to bring in this year's crop.\n\n\"We're always hopeful that those negotiations are moving forward, but yet with harvest here, patience may be running thin,\" one Indiana farmer told CNN, describing the result on America's heartland of inflation, Trump's trade war and the deportation of the industry's key migrant workforce.\n\n\"This is not your ordinary farm crisis. We call it 'farmageddon',\" Joe Jennings, CEO of Daitaas Holdings, a Tennessee-based farm tech and software company, told CNN.",

(Getty)\n\nThe TGA yesterday said it had received preliminary test results on the base formulation used in Ultra Violette Lean Screen SPF50+ and an export-only variant \u2013 both of which the company voluntarily recalled in August \u2013 and 19 other products from 13 other companies.\n\nThose tests found the formula was unlikely to have an SPF of more than 21 and \"may, for at least some of the goods, be as low as SPF four\".\n\nThe TGA said manufacturer Wild Child Laboratories had stopped manufacturing and supplying the base formulation but each sunscreen company would be carrying out its own tests.\n\n\"The TGA is considering whether to take regulatory action with respect to those sunscreens,\" it said.\n\n\"Each company is provided with an opportunity to respond to any proposed regulatory action before the TGA makes a decision.\"\n\nThe TGA also issued a warning about UK-based testing laboratory Princeton Consumer Research, saying it had \"significant concerns\" about the reliability of its tests.\n\nIt said \"many\" companies using the Wild Child-made base formula had \u2013 before being told of the regulator's concerns \u2013 relied on tests performed by PCR to support their SPF claims.\n\nWild Child Laboratories said the TGA had confirmed \"no manufacturing issues were identified at our facility that could explain variability in SPF testing results\" and said the discrepancies were \"part of a broader, industry-wide issue\".\n\n\"We understand the TGA has raised concerns about testing undertaken by PCR Corp and is conducting an ongoing investigation,\" chief executive Tom Curnow told 9news.com.au in a statement.\n\n\"Wild Child has ceased using PCR and initiated confirmatory testing with other accredited, independent laboratories to validate the SPF performance of our products.\n\n\"We remain committed to transparency, product safety, and supporting the introduction of more consistent and objective SPF testing standards across Australia.\"\n\nThe TGA said it had written to PCR but had not received a response. 9news.com.au has contacted PCR for comment.\n\nThe TGA yesterday released a list of sunscreens using the same base formulation . \ufeff\n\nIt stated that where the company responsible for a sunscreen has decided to cancel or recall the affected goods, it is working to support them in doing so.\n\nIt also advised consumers who purchased a product from the list that\ufeff they may wish to consider using an alternative product until the TGA completes its review.\n\nS\ufeffkincare brand Naked Sundays yesterday said it had commissioned more independent testing for its Collagen Glow Mineral Sunscreen, which uses the same base formula but wasn't tested in the Choice report.\n\n\"Preliminary results for Collagen Glow have now been provided to the TGA, confirming our variant provides high sun protection, poses no concern, and we will await further guidance from the regulator,\" it said.\n\n\"Naked Sundays partners with various manufacturers in the US and Australia, and no other Naked Sundays products in Australia and or worldwide are impacted,\" the company said.\n\n\"Naked Sundays is working closely with the TGA to ensure we uphold the highest standards for all our products, and we will adopt any new testing requirements that the TGA may impose as soon as they are in place.\"\n\nOf the 21 products sharing the same base formulation, only two remain on the market in Australia: Allganics Light Sunscreen SPF50+ and GlindaWand The Fountain of Youth Environmental Defence Cream SPF50+.\n\nThe others have all been either voluntarily recalled and cancelled from the regulator's register or temporarily pulled from sale.\n\nYou can find a full and regularly updated list of the sunscreens using the Wild Child base formulation on the TGA website .",

        "text": "A Sydney woman found herself in a race against the clock to buy an affordable home with her fiance amid warnings property prices could skyrocket under the federal government's new five per cent deposit scheme , which comes into effect today.\n\nLinh Hoang, 29, was in the middle of a \"deflating\" journey trying to buy a house in the NSW capital when she realised the first home buyers scheme was creeping up \u2013 and it has the potential to send property prices skyrocketing.\n\nHoang told 9news.com.au she and her partner, Jeffrey, purchased a house and land package in western Sydney just three months ago.\n\nThe Sydney couple bought a house and land package in western Sydney without the five per cent deposit scheme. (Supplied)\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\n\"We found that it was actually better buying before this scheme comes into place because the prices had already gone up and it was going to get a lot more competitive,\" Hoang \u2013 who chronicled her house hunting journey on TikTok \u2013 said.\n\n\"A lot of other mortgage brokers on social media were saying the same thing and I also noticed the trend of over the past, let's say, three months of property prices going up quite drastically.\"\n\nReal Estate Buyers Agents Association of Australia (REBAA) president Melinda Jennison said prices had jumped significantly in many locations in the past month as home buyers like Hoang started to panic about the impact of the scheme on the wider market.\n\n\"Properties that were selling for $750,000 last month are now selling for close to $800,000,\" Jennison said.\n\n\"Many buyers are reportedly panicking with some purchasing sight unseen or overpaying to secure a property before 1 October.\"\n\nHoang and her fiance didn't overpay \u2013 but she certainly felt the panic set in as October 1 drew closer.\n\nHoang said she was deflated by the house hunt in Sydney. (Supplied)\n\nHoang said being a house hunter in Sydney, famously the most expensive property market in Australia, was stressful and at times confusing.\n\nShe sacrificed proximity to the CBD to find a home the couple could afford.\n\n\"There was just so many people looking, but the properties would be tiny,\" she explained.\n\n\"We'd look at it and be like, I can't believe this place is going for $900,000 or $920,000 and it would be a really small property, and it's nothing close to what you're looking for.\n\n\"So, it's very deflating\ufeff.\"\n\nIf the couple were still trying to find a home now, however, Hoang said they may have taken advantage of the federal government's scheme to buy a place closer to the city.\n\nThey would have\ufeff calculated the risk of such a low deposit, though.\n\n\"I definitely think we would,\" she added.\n\n\"The only other thing is obviously your borrowing power doesn't change.\n\n\"So you have to be quite a high earner to be meeting that cap that they've put in place.\"\n\nThe scheme will allow \ufeffall first-home buyers in Australia to purchase a home with only a five per cent deposit instead of the usual 20 per cent.\n\nDr James Graham. (Supplied)\n\nFirst-time home buyers won't have to pay \ufefflenders mortgage insurance either, potentially saving them tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThere will be no caps on places or \ufeffincome limits, meaning all Australian first home buyers can apply regardless of how much they earn.\n\nProperty price caps will also increase to better reflect the average house prices in cities across the country, which have risen significantly since the pandemic.\n\nThe price cap in Sydney will rise from $900,000 to $1.5 million, in Melbourne it will go from $800,000 to $950,000, and in Brisbane it will rise from \ufeff$700,000 to $1 million.\n\nSydney University senior lecturer Dr James Graham, a former senior economist at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, told 9news.com.au that he expects only a small portion of Australians will truly benefit from the scheme.\n\nHe explained a five per cent deposit on mortgages nearing $1 million would mean the loan is only servicable for high-income earners.\n\n\ufeff\"The only people this is really going to benefit are people who have very large incomes, but very low deposits,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not for your typical middle-income first-time home buyers.\n\n\"It's really probably skewed to already fairly wealthy first-time home buyers.\"\n\nThe scheme could result in an extra bump in house prices. (Getty)\n\nGraham predicts \ufeffhouse prices will rise by around three to six per cent under the scheme, on top of the usual market appreciation.\n\nHe also expects an increased demand for homes that sit right under the $1.5 million cap in Sydney.\n\n\ufeffInvestors may also be looking at snapping up homes in this price range to benefit on the uptick in competition, Graham said.\n\n\"You might expect to see a sudden jump in properties right at $1.5 million mark and a bit of a drop off in properties selling right above $1.5 million,\" he added.",

(Jessica Hromas)\n\n'Good news' around the economy despite uncertainty\ufeff\n\nTwo unexpectedly high instalments of monthly inflation data had effectively scuppered any chance of a rate cut before this week's meeting had even started, but Bullock said that wasn't necessarily bad news for the economy.\n\nShe said the increase in prices was driven at least in part by rising incomes, and that consumers getting out and spending was a positive story.\n\n\"That's good news,\" Bullock said.\n\n\"It's good news that activity is responding. So I don't want anyone to think that's bad news, but it just makes us think, well\u2026 it was a good decision today to hold.\"\ufeff\n\nAt the same time, her monetary policy board said the path forward remains murky.\ufeff\n\n\"The board remains alert to the heightened level of uncertainty about the outlook,\" it said in its post-decision statement.\n\n\"It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia.\"\n\nAnother consideration for the central bank was analysing the impact of its three rate cuts already made this year.\n\n\"Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions,\" the board said.\n\n\"The board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve.\"\n\nExperts remain divided over whether the central bank will slash rates again prior to Christmas. (Nine)\n\nThree of the big four banks, including CBA, Westpac and ANZ, think there will be another cut of 25 basis points in early November.\n\nNAB, which earlier indicated it too thought a November rate cut was in play, recently updated its forecast to scrap any change to the cash rate target for 2025.\n\nGraham Cooke, head of consumer research at Finder, said the meeting-to-meeting variability of interest rates was still having a material impact on Aussie families.\n\n\"While relief is starting to filter through, 35 per cent of homeowners are still struggling to pay their mortgage in September,\" he said.\n\n\"Even with another cut expected before Christmas, you don't need to wait to get a better deal. If you're currently paying more than 5.5 per cent for a variable rate, you're probably paying too much.\"\n\nThis year has already seen three interest rate cuts in February, May and August.\n\nCanstar data shows that for the average Australian borrower with a $600,000 mortgage, three cuts is currently equating to a monthly drop of $272 this year.\n\nCanstar data shows that for the average Australian borrower with a $600,000 mortgage, three cuts is currently equating to a monthly drop of $272 this year. (Peter Rae)\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at Canstar, said most are taking these savings and re-injecting them into the loan.\n\n\"That's a decent chunk of money that is already making a difference to household budgets,\" she said.\n\n\"It's astounding to see that so many eligible borrowers aren't pocketing this relief into their bank account but rather, reinvesting it into their mortgage instead.\n\n\"By keeping their repayments unchanged, they're effectively turning each RBA cut into an extra mortgage repayment, which, if kept up for the remainder of their loan, could see them save thousands.\"\n\nTindall said while the RBA has held steady for this meeting, many borrowersv were unknowingly servicing a loan with a higher interest rate than necessary.\n\n\"Borrowers looking to turbo-change the savings even further should consider switching to a lower rate mortgage,\" she said.\n\n\"Right now, the average owner-occupier on a variable rate is estimated to be paying 5.53 per cent, yet there are more than 30 lenders on Canstar offering at least one variable rate under this mark.\n\n\"While the RBA will wait for and act on the data, borrowers don't have to play this waiting game.\"",

It is a difficult skill to execute, and we believe is preventing some of our best umpiring prospects from progressing any further in the AFL pathway despite having elite decision-making skills.\"\n\nThe AFLW, since its inception in 2017, has opted for a ball-up rather than a bouncedown to start quarters and at stoppages. (Getty Images: Daniel Carson/AFL Photos)\n\nSwann went on to say that the decision would have a positive effect in a number of areas.\n\n\"By removing the skill aspect of bouncing the ball, umpires can focus their energy on adjudicating the game and consistency of decision-making,\" he said.\n\n\"We also anticipate this decision will be safer for umpires and players at the contest and lessen the likelihood of umpire contact at the restart.\n\n\"The removal of the bounce we predict will also have a positive impact in the reduction of game length and produce a cleaner and fairer ruck contest, two areas we have been monitoring for the past two seasons.\n\nThe centre bounce has been a part of the game since 1887. (Getty Images: Will Russell/AFL Photos)\n\n\"Additionally, it will also create consistency across national competitions.\"\n\nAFL great James Hird was among the first to comment on the announcement, describing the move to ban the bounce as a \"bad decision\".\n\n\"I think it is a bad decision re the centre bounce, it just favours the tallest guy in the ruck,\" Hird told AFL Trade Radio.\n\n\"You want guys [umpires] with craft. I am disappointed it is gone.\"\n\nThe issue of the substitute player became a major storyline in this year's grand final. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nThe sub rule has also been ditched in favour of a five-player interchange bench.\n\nThe sub rule was criticised by Geelong coach Chris Scott after the Cats' loss in this year's grand final.\n\n\"I'll say one thing \u2014 and I hope this doesn't sound like sour grapes: I think we all \u2014 and I'm at the head of the queue \u2014 will be rapt to see the back of the sub rule,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Besides the seriousness of the injury, the challenges there make planning difficult and it feels like a bit of deja vu in a respect. We were sort of waiting and waiting and it didn't feel like we could make that sub until we had some clarity there.\"\n\nGeelong star forward Jeremy Cameron injured his arm in the second quarter in a collision with teammate Patrick Dangerfield, but stayed in the game before coming off again after hurting himself in a one-handed tackle on Brisbane's Jaspa Fletcher.\n\nScott said after the game that uncertainty over the severity of Cameron's injury made it difficult to manage the timing of making the sub.\n\nIn the end Geelong subbed Rhys Stanley in a tactical move. Scans later showed that Cameron had broken his arm and would require surgery.\n\nIn the AFL statement, Swann said that any additional changes to the rules of the game would be communicated after the next AFL Commission meeting later this month.",

(ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\" It is a more expensive packaging format, but it is something that, rather than doing what's easy, we've chosen to do what's right. \"\n\nMs Brown said the ideal scenario would be that more Australian winemakers got on board to prompt local manufacturing of aluminium bottles.\n\nIn regard to quality, Ms Brown said the company had found aluminium packaging had no impact on taste.\n\nShe suggested Prosecco should not be kept for long periods, but said this was also the case in glass bottles.\n\nAn aluminium wine bottle can be exchanged for 10 cents at containder deposit centres. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nNet zero goal\n\nThe Australian Wine industry has set itself the goal of reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nHowever, the use of heavy glass bottles is where the plan to lower emissions runs into a bottleneck.\n\nWine Australia program manager Julian Marchant said packaging and transport currently accounted for more than 70 per cent of the industry's carbon emissions.\n\nThe Australian wine industry is looking for alternatives to glass to lower emissions. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"Packaging accounts for 44 per cent of all wine supply-chain emissions \u2026 29 per cent is attributed to transport and that is included within Australia and to overseas markets,\" Mr Marchant said.\n\n\"Glass requires a huge amount of energy to produce; the furnaces can run at 1,400 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Glass is a great product, but we love to see a shift to lower emissions products.\"\n\nMore than $1 million of industry and government research grants have been poured into solving the packaging problem.\n\nIdeas explored include polymer bottles, steel bottles, paper bottles and marketing campaigns promoting cask wine.\n\nHowever, consumers' acceptance of change in the wine industry has historically been slow.\n\nThe Stelvin screw-cap was developed by French company Le Bouchage M\u00e9canique in the 1960s, but it was not until the 2000s that it really took off in Australia.\n\nNow, the vast majority of Australian wine is bottled with a screw-cap, and cork screws are buried at the bottom of the utensil drawer.\n\nEmma Brown's family has been making wine since 1889. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"We were one of the first companies to try the Stelvin cap and we didn't get the consumer adoption that we were looking for, so we actually ceased production and waited for the market to catch up,\" Ms Brown said.\n\n\"I think that there's an element of patience \u2014 the consumer doesn't always jump on at day one.\n\n\"I think what's really exciting is that we're always willing to push the status quo, and I'm really proud that we're able to do it within this business.\"",

        "text": "The prime minister says he's \"concerned\" by reports that China has banned iron ore imports from mining giant BHP in the midst of a pricing dispute, saying he wants the issue resolved \"quickly\".\n\nBloomberg reported yesterday that China's state iron ore buyer had ordered steelmakers to pause purchases of iron ore shipments from the company as they continue hardball negotiations with BHP over the price which should be paid for the commodity.\n\nChinese commodity analysis firm Mysteel contradicted that report later in the day, saying no such order had been issued by the China Mineral Resources Group (CMRG) \u2014 which Beijing created to consolidate purchasing power and help control iron ore prices.\n\nBut Anthony Albanese waded into the dispute when he was asked about the reports on Wednesday morning, referring to China's past campaign of economic coercion against the Morrison government.\n\n\"I am concerned about that and what we want to make sure is that markets operate properly. Of course, we have seen those issues in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"I want to see Australian iron ore to be able to be exported to China without hindrance. That is important, it makes a major contribution to China's economy but also to Australia's.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says he is concerned by the reports. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nThe prime minister also suggested the ban might have been imposed by CMRG in an effort to create leverage during their negotiations with BHP.\n\n\"These measures are always disappointing. Let's hope, certainly, that they are very much short-term,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes when people are negotiating over price, sometimes these things will occur. I want to see this resolved quickly.\"\n\nBan seen as 'negotiating tactic'\n\nBHP shares dropped slightly by 1.1 per cent to $42.05 at the open of trade on the ASX, in the wake of the reports and the prime minister's comments.\n\nA BHP spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations. The ABC has approached CMRG and China's Commerce Ministry for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, BHP said it would cut spending on exploration as its annual profit dipped, partly because slowing Chinese demand has forced down iron ore prices.\n\nBeijing is preparing to scale back steel production over 2025\u201326 in a bid to rein in overcapacity, according to an official paper seen by ABC in late August.\n\nThe reduction plan, drawn up by the industry and environment ministries, pledges strict controls on new projects and a gradual cut in output.\n\nIt comes as global oversupply pressures prices and provokes protectionist pushback from major trading partners.\n\nSome market analysts have played down the impact of the apparent ban, arguing that China will have little choice but to continue BHP iron ore shipments.\n\n\"We view this 'ban' as more of a negotiating tactic, most likely an effort to secure lower long-term prices,\" Kaan Peker at RBC Capital Markets said.\n\n\"On government instructions steel mills could try to offset BHP volumes via Fortescue, RIO, Vale, domestic ores, or stockpiles, but in aggregate it would be at higher cost and efficiency loss and this would be at the margin (competitors could currently only absorb a very small portion of BHP's volumes).\"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers also called the reports of the ban \"concerning\" and said he'd set up a conversation with BHP chief executive Mike Henry about the issue.\n\n\"Ultimately though, they are about the commercial arrangements between two companies and so in one respect, it's a matter for the company to work through,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll have discussions with Mike Henry about that in due course when we can set that up.\"\n\nMr Chalmers said the government would work through the issue \"calmly and carefully\" while advocating for Australia.",

        "text": "Helen Schmidt faced a gut-wrenching decision as she looked down at her husband Doug, who was lying in an intensive care unit bed.\n\nIt was a decision forced upon her by a glaring inequity in regional health care: the sparse availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, which play a vital role in diagnosing problems with internal organs.\n\nDoug had been admitted to Hervey Bay's public hospital, three hours north of Brisbane, in a diabetic coma two days prior, with seizures wracking his body.\n\nOnce the seizures had eased, doctors wanted to take Doug off the life support machine.\n\nMRI machines, which can cost between $2\u20133 million, play a vital role in diagnosing issues with internal organs. (Supplied: Hunter Medical Research Institute)\n\nHe would ideally have had an MRI scan to confirm blood flow to his brain before coming off life support.\n\nBut with no MRI machine at the hospital and no scans available at private clinics on weekends, Helen said it was \"just guesswork\" as to whether Doug would survive or sustain brain damage.\n\n\"We decided to take him off the machines and, if he was strong enough, he'd survive,\" she said.\n\n\"If he wasn't, well, we just had to take that chance.\"\n\nDoug survived and slowly came out of the coma over the following week.\n\nHowever, he died a year later in April this year.\n\nHelen Schmidt says the nearby i-Med clinic was not available after hours when her husband required a scan. (ABC News: Nicole Curby)\n\nWhile Helen did not blame the absence of a hospital MRI machine for Doug's death, the stress and trauma of that day galvanised her into action.\n\nShe organised a petition calling for an MRI machine at Hervey Bay Hospital, signed by 6,782 people, which was tabled in Queensland Parliament in September.\n\n\"I put the petition up in memory of Doug, because I don't want anyone to go through what I went through,\" Helen said.\n\nMRI availability\n\nQueensland has 31 MRI machines installed at 19 public hospitals.\n\n\n\nJust over half of these are located in the greater Brisbane area, leaving 15 machines at 11 hospitals scattered throughout the 1.7 million-square-kilometre area of regional Queensland.\n\nThe machines are a significant investment \u2014 a state-of-the-art MRI scanner purchased in 2022 by The Florey, a Victorian brain research centre, cost $2.5 million.\n\nTo fill the gaps in MRI availability, Queensland Health has agreements with private hospitals and radiology chains to provide MRI scans to public patients.\n\nBut, as Helen found, those scans are often not available outside business hours, including weekends.\n\ni-Med, Australia's largest diagnostic imaging company, is contracted to provide scans to patients from Hervey Bay Hospital.\n\nThe company did not respond to the ABC's requests for comment.\n\nA Wide Bay Hospital and Health Service (WBHHS) spokesperson said the service, which included Hervey Bay Hospital, provided same-day MRI scans through private imaging practices for urgent or emergency cases.\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to questions seeking confirmation that the scans were not available after hours, including on weekends.\n\n'I hope they remember my husband'\n\nThe state government has committed to providing six MRI machines to regional public hospitals as part of an $18.5 billion plan to boost Queensland's public health system.\n\nA spokesperson for Health Minister Tim Nicholls said planning was underway to determine locations for the machines, including a workforce analysis to ensure there were qualified staff in place to operate them.\n\nAustralian Medical Association Queensland president Nick Yim, himself a GP in Hervey Bay, urged the government to announce the locations for the new machines.\n\nNick Yim says there is a strong need for an MRI machine at Hervey Bay Hospital.

It's the lack of accountability from the league office.\"\n\nShe alleged Engelbert made alarming comments in a conversation in February about players' compensation, an unsettled issue for a new collective bargaining agreement between the WNBA Players Association and the league.\n\nCollier wanted to know why star players like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers were making so little money from their four-year rookie contracts \u2014 around US$78,000 ($117,976) a season \u2014 while \"clearly driving massive revenue for the league\".\n\nCollier said the likes of Caitlin Clark (right) should be getting paid more. (Getty Images: Steph Chambers)\n\n\"[Engelbert's] response was: 'Caitlin should be grateful she makes $16 million off the court because without the platform the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything,'\" Collier said, with Engelbert's alleged comments running counter to Clark's ability to attract millions in sponsorships while playing for nothing in college.\n\n\"And in that same conversation, she told me: 'Players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them'.\n\n\"That's the mentality driving our league from the top. We go to battle every day to protect a shield that doesn't value us. The league believes it succeeds despite its players, not because of them.\"\n\nThe league office released a response from Engelbert later on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa Collier and for all the players in the WNBA,\" Engelbert said.\n\nTwo of Minnesota's best, Collier and DiJonai Carrington, were sidelined in the play-offs. (Getty Images: Christian Petersen)\n\n\"Together, we have all worked tirelessly to transform this league.

Reese shared and liked the video of Collier's exit press conference with the caption: \"10/10.

        "text": "It's easy to forget just how young Phoebe Litchfield still is.\n\nHaving only turned 22 in April this year, the punchy, breathtakingly talented top order batter has been the future of Australian cricket since before the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn mid-2019, prior to even making her state debut, the then 16-year-old Litchfield was a sensation in Australian cricketing circles after footage of her batting in the NSW nets went viral on social media.\n\nSix months later, she played a match winning knock for the Governor General's XI against India, and only days after that, was lining up alongside Ricky Ponting, Alex Blackwell and Brian Lara for the Bushfire Cricket Bash.\n\nThe hype surrounding Litchfield was reaching the kind of fever pitch reserved for only the most exciting of cricketing prodigies.\n\nHowever, a pandemic interrupted two years plus the continued dominance of a stacked Australian batting line-up meant Litchfield had to wait until late 2022 for her international debut.\n\nSince then, her still obviously generational talent has threatened and simmered, but it has also sputtered at times, with glorious centuries against India and Ireland being tempered by quiet Ashes and T20 World Cup campaigns.\n\nLitchfield is yet to fully announce herself on the international stage. (Getty Images: Pankaj Nangia)\n\nNow, on the eve of her first ODI World Cup, Litchfield finds herself flirting with career-best form, having just topped the run-scoring charts in England's showpiece domestic short-form tournament, the Hundred.\n\nWith the baby-faced, pre-pandemic Litchfield now confined to the realms of sporting prodigies past, and with many of her world beating batting teammates well into the twilight of their careers, Australia's cricketing future has never been better placed to become its present.\n\nAustralia chasing history after an up and down 12 months\n\nThere are few feats that have eluded the modern Australian women's cricket team, but winning consecutive ODI World Cups is one of them. Not since 1988 has a nation gone back-to-back in the tournament, with the green and gold claiming every second instalment since then.\n\nThat's a hoodoo that the 2022 winner will be looking to shake in the tournament to be played in India and Sri Lanka over the next month.\n\nAustralia defeated England in the final of the 2022 ODI World Cup. (Getty: Hannah Peters)\n\nAustralia will begin its campaign as favourite, but perhaps without quite the same aura of invincibility it brought to the tournament three years ago, after a meek exit in last year's T20 World Cup.\n\nDespite winning all four of their group matches, it was a tournament to forget for many of the Australians, including Litchfield. Batting in the middle order and starved of significant strike, she was only able to manage a top score of 18 from five knocks.\n\nFor this modern Australian team, the semifinal loss to South Africa was an unacceptable failure, but one that was avenged in the most comprehensive of fashions with an Ashes whitewash at the start of this year.\n\nAgainst an England side that wilted horribly, all-rounder Ash Gardner and leg-spinner Alana King both had coming of age series for Australia, while Annabel Sutherland continued to shine as Ellyse Perry's heir apparent.\n\nAustralia completed the first ever multi-format Women's Ashes whitewash earlier this year. (Getty Images via Speed Media/Icon Sportswire: Santanu Banik)\n\nHowever, Litchfield was once again underwhelming. She failed to reach 50 in seven attempts in the multi format series, with her highest white ball score being a stodgy and at times excruciating 50 ball 29 in the second ODI.\n\nIn a series so lopsided, that lean run was of little consequence. But in the upcoming World Cup, which has been touted to be the \"the strongest ever\" by captain Alyssa Healy, Australia may well require more from Litchfield.\n\nLitchfield finds her best form in enemy territory\n\nSo, Litchfield's excellent recently completed English summer serves as a timely reminder of the player she still promises to become.\n\nNot only was she the Hundred's player of the tournament and highest scorer, but she compiled her 292 runs at a strike-rate of 157.83 \u2014 the third best of any batter in the tournament.\n\nHowever, translating form across formats and oceans is never a sure thing.\n\nThe spin friendly decks of India and Sri Lanka will provide an entirely different challenge to the one she rose to in England, while the 50 over game is worlds away from the Frankenstein's monster of a format she played there.\n\nODI cricket has a unique, increasingly archaic rhythm, and Litchfield has at times struggled to play her shots to it, oscillating between awkwardly repressing her attacking instincts and living by them too fiercely.\n\nBut her form in Australia's World Cup warm-up matches has been promising.\n\nShe hit 88 against India and then 71 against England, with both knocks hinting at a more balanced and composed Litchfield.\n\nLitchfield was brilliant against India in September. (Getty Images: Ravi Kumar/Hindustan Times)\n\nShe scored at more than a run a ball in both games and, against England, did so while most of her teammates tried and failed to keep pace.\n\nSpeaking after the match against India, Litchfield said she was very aware of the importance of acclimatising to the 50 over format.\n\n\"My brain was probably going a bit quicker than it needed to,\" Litchfield said.\n\n\"50 over cricket is a long game\u2026so I've just got to find the balance.\"\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport? Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nThis World Cup is a transitional tournament for Australia.\n\nWhite the current team has already successfully evolved from the wildly successful side of the 2010s and early 2020s, its spine and identity remains tied to it.\n\nAll time greats Healy and Perry, now 35 and 34 respectively, are both unlikely to feature at another ODI World Cup.\n\nHaving played international cricket since the early 2010s, they are some of the final vestiges of the Australian team of 10 years ago, and do not only offer the current side runs and quality, but mythos and aura as well.\n\nAustralia's generation next has all the ability to build a similar legacy \u2014 Sutherland and Gardner are already world beaters, while the likes of King and Georgia Voll are clearly special talents.\n\nBut it is the true international arrival of Litchfield that would, above all else, signal that the future of Australian cricket has really arrived.\n\nABC Sport will broadcast live radio coverage of every match of the ICC ODI Women's World Cup.

        "text": "When you think of the types of buildings and places that make it onto Australia's heritage listings, you probably imagine large Victorian houses, parliamentary buildings and national parks.\n\nBut tucked away on George Street, Dawes Point, is one of Sydney's most unexpected heritage-listed sites: a cast-iron urinal.\n\nThis \"pissoir\" (yes, that is what it's called; it's French) is one of Australia's oldest, and in the humble opinion of yours truly, one of its most beautiful.\n\nBut age and beauty don't automatically qualify you for heritage protection. So how did this piece of plumbing achieve such a status?\n\nScottish design, Sydney landmark\n\nSydney Council has provided public toilets since 1880, but the George Street pissoir began life across the globe in Glasgow.\n\nThe James Allen Snr & Son's Elmbank foundry specialised in all manner of cast iron public fittings: drinking fountains, railings, bandstands and verandahs \u2014 they did it all.\n\nB G Plummer & Co Sydney supplied the George Street urinal to the Sydney City Council in 1911 \u2014 possibly having cast it from moulds by James Allen Snr & Son's design.\n\nA urinal with an identical design can be found at the SS Great Britain exhibition site in Bristol, England. (Supplied)\n\nBut it's not its exotic origin that makes this pissoir historically significant.\n\nToilets as social history\n\n\"Public toilets matter because they reflect how we value people and their human rights to water and sanitation,\" public toilet researcher and advocate Katherine Webber says.\n\n\"[They're] part of the history of our public spaces, and of whose rights were promoted and facilitated in public spaces.\"\n\nIn the 1880s, Sydneysiders were fed up with the lack of public facilities. Men were urinating in the street, and women \u2014 well \u2014 women had to hold it.\n\nTwo women wait for their male companion outside the George Street urinal at its original location in Observatory Park, Sydney, circa 1973. (Supplied: City of Sydney Archives)\n\n\"With industrialisation and the need to work out of the home, women, alongside men, have been using our public spaces and participating in public life,\" Webber says.\n\n\"However, there have been class and racial differences in the women who have been 'allowed' to be seen or acknowledged participating in public life.\"\n\nAs historian Anna Temby points out, the main barrier to installation for public toilets (aside from finances) has been the question of where to put them.\n\nOn one hand, public toilets need to be in convenient and safe locations. But on the other hand, there has always been strong community resistance to installation of toilets \u2014 especially female toilets \u2014 in visible areas.\n\nWatch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.\n\n\"While the municipal councils built numerous facilities for men, there was public debate about the impact [of] the provision of toilets for women,\" Ms Webber says.\n\n\"These included that public toilets for women would lower property prices \u2026 increase congestion on the footpaths, despite there already being urinals in the same location, and cause traffic accidents.\"\n\nSubversive spaces\n\nWhile women have been battling for a place to piss for over a century, male urinals were not without their own PR crisis in the 20th century.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nLong being known as hot spots for drug use, sex work and as gay beats, male public toilets were seen as spaces that encouraged subversive and even criminal activity.\n\n\"Across Sydney, some public toilets have been a key location that have meaning for the gay community, with some activists and academics calling for their preservation to capture their historical significance of gay pride,\" Ms Webber says.\n\n\"They have been used as beats, public toilets known for homosexual pick-up sex, but also the sites of police entrapment and brutality.\"\n\nThe pissoir was installed in its current location in the 1970s. (Supplied: City of Sydney Archives.)\n\nSaved from the scrap heap\n\nAlthough protected and conserved today, the pissoir on George Street was almost lost to the scrap heap.\n\nIn 1971 it was dismantled and removed from its original location in Observatory Park, but \u2014 after a strong campaign from heritage-minded locals and public-toilet enthusiasts \u2014 it was saved and moved to its current location under Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n\"The urinal was listed as a locally significant heritage item in 2012,\" a City of Sydney spokesperson says, and it remains \"a tangible reminder of the council's long history of providing public amenities in Sydney\".\n\nToilets as art?\n\nAlthough you won't see many council-issue public toilets as elegantly decorated as this one today, design is just as important as ever when it comes to public amenities.\n\n17th-century mapmakers had vivid ideas about Australia. They were wrong Photo shows Colourful sketched map with Latin writing at the top and many intersecting lines across the page. Seventeenth-century mapmakers had bold ideas of Australia, and some incredible methods of depicting them.\n\nWhen asked how she rates the George Street pissoir, Ms Webber praises the cast-iron design's beauty, and says it's a shame these details are lost in current public toilet design.\n\n\"I love a public toilet that incorporates public art or reflects the local environs,\" Webber says.\n\n\"By being attractive, a public toilet can make people feel like it is designed for them to use and also to care for. The built environment contains cues on how to behave.\n\n\" People are not going to want to keep a space clean that doesn't look clean to begin with, that is not well-maintained, that looks and feels institutional. \"\n\nEveryday beauty\n\nAlthough it's just a urinal, Sydney's George Street pissoir is a remnant from an era when even the most base and unsavoury things were considered worthy of beautification.\n\nUnfortunately, today it is temporarily fenced and not usable for its original purpose \u2014 can't have blokes taking a leak on a historical artefact!\n\nBut fear not! If you ever find yourself in Millers Point, fresh off a Sydney Harbour Bridge climb and in need of a whiz, a fully equipped public toilet is right next door with male, female, unisex, baby change and accessible facilities for all.",

(ABC News: Lani Oataway)\n\n\"I didn't even know half the stuff I know now about drones,\" she said.\n\n\"I was interested in technology in general, but flying and aerospace, because we've done a bit about how planes work and fly, it's been really interesting.\"\n\nFellow year 10 student Ethan Chang said the course sparked a stronger interest in the field.\n\nEthan Chang says the program has sparked his interest in engineering and robotics. (ABC News: Lani Oataway)\n\n\"I like the process, I like engineering and I'm probably going to continue with this path of work and try it more,\" he said.\n\n\"I really like robotics, the design aspect and the maths of it.\"\n\nBlueprint forward\n\nLithgow was established in the 1800s and grew to mine the seams of the western coalfields.\n\nMore than a dozen mines have operated in the area, as well as two power stations with the capacity to supply energy to more than 2 million homes.\n\nNow just three coal mines are in operation, and the remaining Mount Piper Power Station has a closure date of 2040.\n\nThe Mount Piper Power Station provides about 15 per cent of the electricity for NSW. (Supplied: EnergyAustralia)\n\nThe drone program is part of Lithgow Council's Emerging Economy Plan (LEEP), which acts as a blueprint to transition the district away from coal.\n\nLEEP Adaptive Skills Hub manager Jess Jennings said it was a difficult task when almost half of the city's GDP was made up of coal and its related jobs.\n\n\"If you look at that declining over the next five to 15 years, that's a significant reduction,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy to fill that gap, so I have to start with the future workforce, with current students.\"\n\nThe council applied for further funding to set up a Central West STEM Academy, which would expand the program to the neighbouring Mudgee district.\n\nMr Jennings said it was about preparing students to pivot to any future industry.\n\nJess Jennings says the LEEP team hopes to expand the program to the Mudgee region. (ABC News: Lani Oataway)\n\n\"It's about getting into those higher value jobs and having that same ripple effect for Lithgow.\"\n\nLithgow High School principal Foty Loupos believes those ripple effects are already being observed by his year 10 students picking senior subjects.\n\n\"Since I've been here for the last four years, we've seen the highest-ever subject choices in the hard sciences,\" he said.\n\nMr Loupos said he was grateful for the interest the pilot program was generating but wanted to see it become part of the curriculum.\n\n\"We're 25 years into the 21st century,\" he said.\n\nThe Lithgow Emerging Economy Plan maps the district's transition away from coal. (ABC News: Lani Oataway)\n\n\"This is not still cutting edge for me, I think we're still playing catch-up.\n\n\"We should be looking at systems that enable this to be core business, so that all students in public high schools can have access to this type of skill set.\"\n\nSally said she believed the tools she was learning to use were invaluable to shaping Lithgow's path forward.\n\n\"I think giving students skills that are not traditional for coal mining is really good for leading towards a greener future,\" she said.\n\n\"[It] will really help Lithgow in the long run to convert to greener energy and to not lean upon coal as much.\"\n\nThe students will deliver a light show with the drones at their end-of-year presentation. (ABC News: Lani Oataway)\n\nMeanwhile, Coal Australia said in a statement that while global coal consumption was at record highs, it was engaging with school students in a different way.\n\nIt said it was partnering with the Mackay Resources Centre of Excellence in Queensland to promote coal mining to local students.\n\n\"We look forward to hosting similar events in other parts of Queensland and NSW,\" chief executive Stuart Bocking said.",

        "text": "When - thanks to the BHP boss - the industry moved to market-related pricing that better reflected the overall supply-demand balance, pricing power moved from the mills to the miners. Loading China, as the world\u2019s biggest steel producer and therefore the largest consumer of iron ore \u2013 it imported about 1.24 million tonnes of ore last year \u2013 believes it should be able to have a more direct influence over its pricing. CMRG is now the biggest trader in the iron ore market, buying ore when prices are lower and selling it when prices are higher to remove the historical price volatility. With open-ended financial backing from the state, it has been able to build up a stockpile of ore thought to total about 20 million tonnes, both to enable it to trade and to provide a national strategic reserve. It has largely tamed what was previously significant speculative activity in the market.\n\nBut what it hasn\u2019t been able to do, yet, is to significantly shift the leverage in pricing negotiations away from the miners, even though the miners effectively face a near-monopsony buyer - a market with pretty much only one buyer. The structure of the market is, however, about to change. Loading Next month, Rio Tinto, its Chinese partner Chinalco and the Guinean government are expected to ship their first cargo of iron ore from the Simandou project in Guinea, the world\u2019s largest and richest undeveloped iron ore resource. While it probably won\u2019t be until next decade before the total Simandou project scales up to its planned output of 120 million tonnes a year \u2013 next year\u2019s production is expected to be about 10 million tonnes, rising to about 60 million tonnes in 2027 \u2013 it will introduce a new player, with the highest quality ore, into the market.\n\nIt won\u2019t be the lowest-cost producer, with the miners having to sink the best part of $US20 billion ($30.3 billion) into extensive rail and port infrastructure, including a new 620 kilometre-plus heavy haulage rail line and a new port. Its capital intensity will probably push it into the sector\u2019s third quartile for production costs. Its iron ore will, however command premium prices. Australian miners, particularly BHP and Rio, are able to leverage off their existing long-established infrastructure, their relative proximity to China, the ferrous content of their ore and their positioning at the low end of the cost curve. CMRG would be very mindful of the fact that not only is iron ore supply about to increase, but demand is starting to shrink. For much of its recent history, China has consistently produced about one billion tonnes of steel a year. This year it seems inevitable that it will fall short of that mark. In the first eight months of 2025, its mills produced 671.8 million tonnes, about 3 per cent less than in the same period last year.\n\nChina\u2019s steel industry, like most of the industries that Beijing regards as strategic, is awash with over-capacity, which has sparked ferocious price wars, a chronic lack of profitability and, with China\u2019s economic growth rate slowing, triggered a flood of exports that is adding to global trade frictions and generating pushback from other countries in the midst of Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars. Despite having a global market share of more than 50 per cent, the industry had, on average, negative profit margins last year. As part of his response to what the authorities call \u201cinvolution\u201d or \u201cneijuan\u201d \u2013 torrid price wars that drive losses because of excess capacity \u2013 Xi Jinping is trying to rationalise industries with chronic over-supply problems, and steel is at the forefront of those efforts. Instead of responding to pressures in the sector as it has in the past with a massive burst of infrastructure spending to boost domestic demand for steel, Beijing has developed a new steel industry plan that bans new capacity and forces the phasing out of outdated equipment to reduce its capacity, while targeting greater value-added products and lower emissions. With its steel output, and its demand for iron ore, having peaked and trending down, if Beijing is successful, and with a new source of supply entering the market, the structural shift in the balance of power that Beijing has long sought and which CMRG has been charged with is within sight.\n\nLoading That doesn\u2019t mean the Australian iron ore miners will be driven out of the market. They can all survive and make solid profits, at far lower prices than today\u2019s, which is around $US105 a tonne. The entry of new higher quality but high-cost ore is more likely to drive out other high-cost producers with low-grade ore. Price peaks might, however, be significantly lower, the market\u2019s pricing might become increasingly stable and there might be a more equitable power balance in negotiations between iron ore producers and their customers. The periods of super-profitability and extraordinarily fat margins might be ending, which helps explain why BHP and Rio are so intent on building major presences in other commodities, particularly copper. China\u2019s steel industry is, however, rationalising and consolidating, not disappearing.",

That\u2019s a great privilege. \u201cI remember when I first met Morry, he said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re the strangest person I\u2019ve ever met because you don\u2019t read magazines and all your friends are over 70\u2019.\u201d\n\nMorry is Schwartz\u2019s third husband Morry Schwartz, the developer-publisher and owner of Schwartz Media, which publishes The Saturday Paper, The Monthly, Quarterly Essay and Black Inc books. They married in 1993. She is clearly a private individual but Present Tense: Anna Schwartz Gallery and Thirty-Five Years of Contemporary Australian Art by Doug Hall (published by Black Inc) tells extraordinary stories of Melbourne\u2019s arts scene and Schwartz\u2019s life. The interconnectedness of Melbourne, its cultural and Jewish communities, is everywhere. Schwartz\u2019s paternal family arrived as Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Poland in 1938; Schwartz met art patrons John and Sunday Reed when she was 19. Her first husband, artist Joel Elenberg, a friend with artist Brett Whiteley, died from cancer aged 32. Schwartz, who remains close friends with Wendy Whiteley, later married the filmmaker Bob Weis in the 1980s. On page 74 of the book, a young Morry Schwartz is involved in a minor car crash. Elenberg and Weis \u2013 neighbourhood friends of his youth \u2013 were with him in the same car. Rock flathead with vermouth sauce at Gimlet. Credit: Simon Schluter Schwartz reports her entr\u00e9e \u2013 raw tuna with green olives and smoked chilli ($38) \u2013 as \u201cfaultless, fresh, delicious\u201d but \u201cnot too cheffy\u201d. \u201cMost restaurants I kind of recoil from, but anything Andrew produces I am really happy to eat.\u201d\n\nMy entr\u00e9e special of Spencer Gulf prawns with calamari ($48) contains braised butter beans which offset the seafood brilliantly. Schwartz labels our choice of mains \u201cunadventurous\u201d after we both order rock flathead with sorrel and vermouth sauce ($56). Schwartz requests her mussels be removed. It\u2019s comfort food meal in the European tradition of Gimlet, the sweet-flavoured fillets sitting upon an aromatic vermouth sauce. And yes, another glass of champagne. Each. Loading The press release announcing the move from Anna Schwartz Gallery to Anna Schwartz Projects contains a long list of contemporary artists the gallery and Schwartz herself had supported over the years, including Shaun Gladwell, Kathy Temin, Warwick Thornton, Justene Williams and Mike Parr. In December 2023 Schwartz severed ties after 36 years with Parr, a performance artist and longtime friend, after he had painted the words \u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cNazi\u201d during a performance piece in her gallery. The relationship was over, but Schwartz let the work remain on display.\n\nBut Schwartz will barely be drawn on the conflicts in Melbourne\u2019s cultural life over Gaza as she studies the crowd of diners and responds slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of various relationships with artists over the years. A lot of artists that the gallery had relationships with and then ceased. And so there\u2019s nothing so anomalous about that, really. \u201cOne always hopes at the inception of relationships, that they\u2019re going to flourish, and they often do for many years, and then, for various reasons, they come to an end.\u201d We are interrupted by a waiter. The moment is lost. Later I try again, with a question about the impacts of the Israel Gaza conflict on the Melbourne cultural scene.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t really want to discuss that,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an unnecessarily culturally divided time in Australia. I value a society which can support discussion \u2026 in a civilised, intelligent way.\u201d Loading She delivers a philosophical response, but how have the past couple of years been personally? \u201cWell, I guess my personal life and my career are two trajectories,\u201d Schwartz says thoughtfully, before continuing. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to use your teaspoon? Have a tiny bit? It\u2019s too much for me.\u201d She is distracting me with her serving of gelato. I succumb.\n\nOn other issues she is vocal, railing against some collectors. \u201cI think a lot of art collecting today is souveniring, buying the names. Anna Schwartz at Gimlet. Credit: Simon Schluter \u201cArt and culture are pluralistic, that there are all kinds of ways of living, seeing, collecting, whatever. I\u2019m not interested in that. I\u2019m interested in the kind of really serious presentation of ideas at the forefront of art practice as is generated by a long history, by a long trajectory of thinking and philosophising in this domain. That\u2019s where I find it worthwhile.\u201d She wants to show me the humour in the gallery\u2019s latest exhibition of artist Rose Nolan.",

A spokesperson said Optus had confirmed with police that those affected were \"OK\" and the issue had been fixed.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Calls mount for independent inquiry into Optus triple-zero failures\n\nOn Tuesday, Optus said Ericsson's equipment \"did not appear to operate as it should\" and that it was working with the provider to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus said initial assessments of Sunday's outage indicated 4G services in a tower at Dapto were not operational.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tower appeared active on the network, but calls attaching to it were impacted and did not transfer to other networks, the company said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Optus' ability to detect the outage was impacted as the Ericsson equipment in the cell tower did not alarm that 4G services were not operational,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are assured by Ericsson that they have their global product development unit urgently analysing this.\"\n\n\n\nSecond triple-zero outage in less than a fortnight\n\nSunday night's outage is the second such incident in less than a fortnight for the telco, after it suffered an outage on 18 September that impacted parts of South Australia, Western Australia, the NT and NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 600 calls were disrupted, and the outage has been linked to the deaths of at least three people. That incident is the subject of an Optus probe and federal communications watchdog investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus has claimed human error caused the first outage after no one diverted calls to a separate part of the core network, as required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Standard processes were not followed,\" Optus chief executive Stephen Rue said at the time.\n\n\n\nSingtel chief executive Yuen Kuan Moon and federal Communications Minister Anika Wells met in Sydney on Tuesday, along with Rue and chair John Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey discussed technical details about the outages and ways to restore trust in Australia's second-largest telco and the triple-zero system.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Yuen said of the first outage: \"It's a people issue and it takes time to change and transform the people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur similarly told reporters: \"The incident on the 18th was a process-related incident. People made mistakes.\"\n\n\n\n'Systemic failures'\n\nOn Wednesday, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Optus laying the blame for the outages on frontline workers was \"disgraceful\" and an attempt to absolve the company's \"systemic failures\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How Optus' most senior bosses can stand up and openly blame frontline staff for what is clearly a systemic failure is beyond comprehension,\" CWU national secretary Shane Murphy said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The company has a responsibility to the Australian people to ensure that there are water-tight systems in place to ensure that when they need to call triple-zero, they can.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMurphy said the telco attributing blame to frontline workers was a \"disgraceful attack\" on people \"attempting to do their jobs under incredibly difficult circumstances\", citing offshoring and outsourcing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the system can\u2019t carry a triple-zero call, that's a boardroom failure, not a 'people failure.'\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Simone was a loyal Optus customer.

In Canberra, the wait drops from four and a half years to just over twelve months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis used the property price caps set under the scheme in each city, along with the average gross disposable income for a two-person household. It does not include stamp duty or transaction costs.\n\n\n\nThose in Sydney could shave off seven years of saving with the government's new First Home Guarantee scheme, according to Domain analysis. Source: SBS News\n\n'Fast entry' for buyers\n\nThe expanded first-home buyer guarantee scheme will allow eligible Australians to secure a loan with a 5 per cent deposit, without paying lender's mortgage insurance \u2014 a cost that typically adds thousands upfront.\n\n\n\n\n\nEligibility has also been expanded: all first-home buyers can now apply, with no income caps, and the property price caps have been lifted to reflect the current market conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, said the scheme will \"shave years off the time it takes to save [for a deposit], irrespective of what capital city you are in\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fast entry for first-home buyers,\" Powell told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This opens up opportunities for more Australians. There are no caps on places, and there are no income caps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More Australians will be able to benefit \u2026 it opens up choice \u2026 [and] higher caps open up more opportunities.\"\n\n\n\nRising rental costs have further enhanced the value proposition of the scheme to first-home buyers, Cotality's head of research, Eliza Owen, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even though a smaller deposit means paying more interest over time, it could still work out cheaper for renters,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said the scheme would help young Australians start building equity in their own home rather than paying off someone else's mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's life-changing,\" she said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Government announces early start to deposit scheme as it builds case for housing policy in new Parliament SBS News 05:51 English\n\nBut experts also caution that while a smaller deposit can get you into the market sooner, it also means higher repayments and, without a clear plan to pay down the loan quickly, significantly more interest over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I were a first-time buyer taking on this thing, you need to build in a buffer to ensure that you can meet those mortgage repayments, particularly if we eventually see the cash rate going up, which is not in the foreseeable next 12 months, but I think a buffer is absolutely necessary,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And if you've only got 5 per cent equity in a home, that is quite a bit of risk. There is that risk that you could fall into negative equity, particularly if prices pull back.\"\n\n\n\nA 'backwards step' to solving the housing crisis\n\nBut others say the scheme risks backfiring.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Smith, partner at Deloitte Access Economics, said policies like this address demand rather than supply \u2014 and that's where the meat of the problem lies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the government policy with respect to housing has been to support housing demand \u2014 that is, to make it easier for people to buy properties,\" Smith told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the problem is that ultimately, if you are just pushing up demand but not increasing the supply of properties, then you're just pushing up the price of property.\"\n\n\n\nTreasury modelling suggests the scheme will add only about half a percentage point to house prices over six years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Smith said the real impact is likely to be greater in the lower-priced segment of the market, where buyers are using the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these markets, Smith anticipates a 3 to 5 per cent increase in prices \u2014 enough, he argues, to wipe out much of the intended benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is very likely to push up property prices more or less by the amount of support that is being provided,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The net impact will be that it's not really much easier for people to get into the property market at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way to address the housing market is to boost supply, not to add to demand.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Lifting caps from first home buyer scheme will help some but fuel wider price rise\n\n\"This, unfortunately, is not a policy that will improve the housing crisis. It will add to demand. It's a bit of a backward step in terms of solving the housing crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell cautions that while the smaller deposit makes entry easier, it doesn't change the reality of mortgage repayments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have to remember that if you're getting a 95 per cent loan, some first home buyers just won't be able to borrow enough to purchase, even with this home guarantee scheme,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those considering the scheme, Powell said caution is key. She says people risk over-leveraging themselves if they borrow too much and may also be eligible for other state grants and concessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

The education is clearly a very important component of this standard, but there are other pieces that come to the board for the practitioner to be endorsed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDanielle McMullen from the Australian Medical Association says this change will ensure more collaboration between medical professionals to ensure patients get better care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The model of care of nurse prescribing that's been the outcome here does encourage that team-based care because it does require nurses to be working in partnership with doctors or nurse practitioners to make sure that that prescribing is really safe and effective.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jane Mills is from the Rural Health School at La Trobe University.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the move is designed to address critical health workforce shortages, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Regional and rural clients in particular, because the shortage of practitioners in the regions is quite acute, which means that sometimes people can wait for very long periods of time before they can actually access a clinician.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrances Rice is from the Australian Royal College of Nursing.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the move will expand people's access to medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There will be an uptake in hospital settings, but I think the biggest bang for our buck will be in those outside of hospital settings.... enabling people to have more timely and affordable access to medications in the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this stage, qualified health professionals will be able to prescribe all medications.... but there's a note of caution, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are calls for so-called Schedule Eight controlled drugs, or those considered highly addictive to be off-limits for nurses to prescribe.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs McMullen says a higher level of professional expertise may be required in these circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are riskier medicines like morphine and other opioids or other drugs of dependence and we do think it's really important an experienced prescriber is involved in that.\"\n\n\n\n",

I don't think we'd be doing it for the stat, it wouldn't be something on our whiteboard before a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But little things like that are great because you're creating history.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia regularly enter global tournaments as favourites and have won seven of the 12 ODI events (the first tournament was in England in 1973).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they were narrowly beaten in the final in 2000 in England, edged out in Australia in 2009 and shocked in the 2017 semi-final when victim to a Harmanpreet Kaur assault for India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just shows how hard it is to win World Cups,\" vice-captain Tahlia McGrath said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tournament play is at times very unpredictable. You can't have an off game and the finals are so clutch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This tournament's still the pinnacle of all of them, the one that you want to win. Being reigning champs, we really want to go back-to-back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's so hard to do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia again loom as Australia's biggest threat, having challenged them in a lead-in series and holding the advantage of home conditions for the finals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia have vowed to take a more aggressive approach into the tournament, following white-ball defeats to England in the 2023 Ashes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not so much about the captaincy, or ticking one more box,\" Healy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like I want to win a World Cup for Australia, and no one has gone back-to-back, which is a real motivator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I just want to see the team playing really well and enjoying themselves, and I know if we do that, then we're a real big chance of holding the trophy up.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells has met with representatives of Optus and its parent company, Singtel, to convey her conviction that recent failures have been unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of two Triple-Zero outages in the space of 10 days, she says she has sought assurances similar failures will not happen again, but stood by the government's response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have said that Optus will face significant consequences as a result of what has happened here, but it is for me as the minister to take those decisions after the ACMA investigation is complete.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Media and Communications Authority is investigating the failures, which have been linked to four deaths, with hundreds of customers unable to reach emergency services.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition communications spokeswoman Melissa McIntosh says the ACMA itself formed part of the failure, calling for investigations that are independent of the regulator.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's speaking here with the ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cACMA, as the regulator, was alerted to the Optus outage, where, sadly, four people passed away the other week. They were alerted on Thursday. It is a responsibility by law that Optus did that. They alerted ACMA and they alerted the department of communications, but the minister is saying she did not find out until Friday. So ACMA did not act on that alert, they did not alert the minister. So, how can the regulator, be the investigator when they're part of the failed process?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens Communications Spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young is also calling for stronger action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe minister has got to do something. Simply fobbing this off to the regulator that has continued to fail to protect consumers and to protect users - and instead, really is more of a industry lap dog than a watch dog - is not good enough, and ACMA has failed. They continue to fail to hold these corporations to account, and the minister has got to do something about that too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter meeting with Singtel CEO Yuen Kuan Moon, chair of the Optus Board, John Arthur, and Optus CEO, Stephen Rue, Ms Wells said the government may take further action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce that independent regulator investigation is complete, it is for the Australian government to hand down any further penalties beyond what you can expect from the regulator and any further system wide change that may be required to give Australians confidence back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, she largely framed the recent outages as a compliance failure on Optus' part, rather than representative of systemic issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Hanson-Young says there are immediate actions Ms Wells can take to increase public confidence that this won't happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe minister has the power, under existing law, to impose conditions on the license. So one of the things we've we asked the minister to do last week was to put in place an independent expert, someone to oversee how Optus was managing and responds in relation to its triple-zero service.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the media after meeting with Anika Wells, Mr Yuen apologised to customers, and attributed the failure to human error, as well as technical issues which are as yet undisclosed.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has pledged to publicly release the findings of an external review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe board has commissioned independent review by Dr Kerry Schott, and the board has agreed that her findings will be shared openly with everyone in due time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stood by Optus Australia CEO, Stephen Rue, whose position the opposition has increasingly questioned since the initial outage on September 18.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a second outage occurred in the New South Wales Illawarra region over recent days, Mr Yuen concedes significant reform is needed at Optus.\n\n\n\n\n\nYUEN: \"We brought in Stephen 11 months ago to transform Optus, to really address the issues that we have had since 2022-23.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: How do you think he's going?\n\n\n\n\n\nYUEN: It is very early days. It takes time to transform a company. Stephen has identified, and I believe so in the initial investigation of the 18th September incident, it is due to a people issue, and it takes time to transform and change the people. He is here to provide the solution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus has faced hundreds of millions in fines in recent years, most recently due to sales practices that were found to breach consumer law.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Communications Consumer Action Network CEO Carol Bennett says she hopes Optus can achieve cultural change.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's also urging the government to implement recommendations from the Bean review, completed after the last Optus outage in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are outstanding recommendations from that review that still need to be implemented. And one of those is the triple-zero custodian rules. We need to have an ecosystem wide understanding of the triple-zero system so that we can ensure that it is going to live up to the necessary obligations and requirements on telcos to deliver safety for the Australian public.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, Ms Bennett says that without external oversight, she has serious doubts about Optus' capacity to avoid a repeat of recent outages, which may have cost lives.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "For the prime minister to successfully bring down grocery bills, economists say it will take more than extending an invitation for a United Arab Emirates supermarket giant to set up shop in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese stopped by Lulu Hypermarket in Abu Dhabi on Monday night, one of the largest retailers in the Middle East, and invited it to expand its business in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that Aldi, of course, has come to Australia, but this is a significant player that has an engagement with Australia and I want to see that competition,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Jericho, chief economist at the left-leaning Australia Institute think tank, said more competition for Woolworths and Coles would be a win for Australian shoppers, but that a new chain would need extra support to break up the duopoly and ultimately, drive down prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPointing to Aldi as an example, he told SBS News that the German discount chain initially helped bring down prices 20 years ago, before everyone \"settled into a cosy arrangement\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Albanese invites Arab 'hypermarket' to compete with Coles and Woolworths\n\nJericho said there are some levers for the government to pull if it wants to take a serious approach to a new competitor and lower grocery bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nBree Hurst, deputy director of Queensland University of Technology's Centre for Decent Work and Industry, said current market imbalances have created a food system designed for overproduction and oversupply.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said while new players may reduce the duopoly between Woolworths and Coles, it's \"no quick fix or silver bullet\" for driving down prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we really need is to look closely at our entire food system,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nIs there space for a new supermarket?\n\nIn March, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) released its final report after a year-long supermarket inquiry, finding the dominance of Woolworths and Coles had an \"oligopolistic\" effect on the broader industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite setting up shop in 2001, two decades on, Aldi only holds 9 per cent of the market, in comparison to Woolworths at 38 per cent or Coles at 29 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACCC said there was a \"limited incentive\" for the supermarket giants to compete on price due to their market dominance and acknowledged there are \"significant barriers\" for new or smaller supermarkets to enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nJericho said for a new player to be effective in bringing down prices, they will need to acquire sites in locations that make a difference.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese welcomed competition for giants Coles and Woolworths, in hopes of lowering prices for consumers. Source: Supplied / PMO \"There's only a limited number of places where a supermarket can set up, and so even with, for example, Lulu coming in, there needs to be regulations in place to ensure that they actually can get a foothold in the market,\" Jericho said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because this is a problem in a lot of places, especially in small country towns, there's only one player in the entire town.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACCC inquiry found that since 2019, the two supermarket giants have acquired approximately 260 sites between them, which include land and shopping centres, making it difficult for smaller stores to compete.\n\n\n\nSupermarket breakup key to lower prices, Greens say\n\nGreens senator Nick McKim agrees the supermarket sector needs more competition but argues Albanese is going about the challenge \"the wrong way\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The prime minister needs to stop protecting the supermarket corporations and start going into bat for Australian shoppers,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the way to do that is to introduce divestiture powers that would allow for the supermarket to be broken up, and that would create the preconditions for more competition in the supermarket sector and lower food and grocery prices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said foreign supermarket corporations have been \"dissuaded and ultimately decided not to come here\" in the past due to the power of the duopoly in the country.\n\n\n\nMcKim acknowledged introducing legislation to make price gouging by supermarkets illegal, a Labor election promise, was a \"step forward\".\n\n\n\n\n\nJericho suggests creating a price commission which would give the ACCC the ability to scrutinise how much supermarkets charge and, in turn, the power to affect prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said while the ACCC can currently assess whether major players are colluding, it's not allowed to examine how they set prices, unless it suspects illegal activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They would actually have powers to go in and say to the supermarkets, show me your books,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Justify your profit margins, justify why you are charging these prices, and in a sense, justify that you're not actually ripping off the customers, that you're not taking advantage of your market power.\"\n\n\n\nAustralians are changing the way they shop to combat high prices, from opting for frozen food over fresh to shopping around at different retailers, according to Canstar Blue's latest survey. Source: AAP / Dan Peled Hurst also warned against creating a situation which \"results in price wars that, while a win for consumers, ultimately drive down prices for our growers\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our research suggested things like better provisions around unfair trading practices, improving data transparency for growers, and changes to contracting practices/supply agreements to try to reduce overproduction would also be useful.\"\n\n\n\n",

And so it is a consequence of living a lot longer and Australia is I think the second or third longest living country on earth so well in a lot of ways\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Tracy Comans there - she's a Professorial Research Fellow at the University of Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently named dementia as the leading cause of death in Australia for women and the second-biggest killer of men after heart disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in 10 Australians died from a form of the disease in 2023, the most common of which are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Comans is also one of the authors of guidelines created for improving the lives of people with dementia in and out of aged care.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne area identified is that people living with dementia often receive inadequate pain management because they cannot accurately verbalise or localise the pain they are experiencing.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Comans says there is a lack of data relating to four key measurements for the care of people experiencing dementia, including pain management, dignity, hygiene and meaningful activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So this is really about how we should measure outcomes of care for people living with dementia. So what we set out to do in this project was look at all the different domains that are possible and we engaged very closely with stakeholders. So with people experiencing dementia and their carers and industry partners from the very beginning of this project. And really co-designed that process to look at what was important to them. So these were the outcomes that we found that we could actually measure straight away so that's our recommendation, that these things are the things that we should be be looking at measuring because these are key outcomes to important to people with dementia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidelines have been developed in collaboration with other universities, aged care providers, carers and people with dementia to assist in policy development and for aged care providers to review current practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an ageing population, more than one million Australians are predicted to be living with dementia by 2065.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lack of staffing in aged care homes and the community is a major issue now, and will continue to be so in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah it's it's been a key problem for a long time and we know that in the care economy workers have been underpaid for a long time and obviously the change in working conditions has been highly welcomed. I think it's going to take some time for that to flow through and for us to see the impact on retention because some of those pay rises are quite recent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople experiencing dementia often suffer from a lack of continuity of care due to high staff turnover and a lack of dementia specific training in the aged care sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Comans says while pay rates have improved for care staff, it's likely to be a while before this translates to better trained staff and care on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile dementia is a leading cause of death it's not a natural consequence of ageing.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetics and lifestyle also play a role and it's a tricky disease to diagnose especially early on.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Janet Van Eersel is a Senior Research Fellow at Macquarie Medical School Dementia Research Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So by the time you show symptoms, you've already lost a lot of the cells in your brain. Really important brain cells. So by the time you show symptoms you're already at a critical stage. It is very hard to treat that. So hopefully with better imaging and now with the arrival of some new blood tests hopefully we will be able to diagnose people at risk a lot earlier. Instead of trying to treat people when they're 60 or 70 potentially treating them when there maybe 40 or 50 when it's already showing maybe in their blood that certain levels of certain risk factors are going up. I think that will go a long way as well. Treating earlier will always be better than trying to fix something that's already happened\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious studies suggest that lifestyle changes such exercise, diet and social interaction may help slow or prevent the symptoms of dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lancet Journal in 2024 identified 14 modifiable risk factors, including traumatic brain injury, depression, obesity, lack of exercise, too much alcohol, hearing loss and social isolation among others that could reduce rates by up to a third.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Janet Van Eersel says there have also been developments in diagnostic blood tests with some having been approved recently by the FDA in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I guess we're still trying to understand how useful they are. So they are regularly used in clinical trials where we can't put or don't want to put everyone through an imager every time. And this is something that we can do with patients you know from much much earlier on when has something like my cognitive impairment you could start already measuring their baseline levels that is how they progressively increase. But this is something it's very, very new so just in the last year or two so it certainly something that we have to wait and see how we go and where this leads us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia or FECCA says one in three Australians over the age of 65 is from a multicultural background.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UNSW Centre for Population Ageing Research reported that those who speak languages other than English at home or who have poor English proficiency are at a higher risk of dementia in old age.\n\n\n\n\n\nFECCA would like to see more inclusive aged care plans that better reflect the cultural, spiritual and dietary needs of this group.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS a spokesperson for FECCA said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Language barriers can lead to misdiagnosis or delays, especially if interpreters aren\u2019t used. Stigma is another big issue. In some cultures, dementia is seen as shameful or even a mental illness, which can stop families from seeking help. Many people also struggle to navigate a complex health and aged care system without culturally tailored information. And as dementia progresses, people often lose second languages and revert to their first language, which can make mainstream care settings isolating. These challenges can lead to late diagnosis, higher stress for carers, poorer outcomes unless services actively address cultural and linguistic needs, all of which could mean greater cost to the older person and the healthcare system.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "When - thanks to the BHP boss - the industry moved to market-related pricing that better reflected the overall supply-demand balance, pricing power moved from the mills to the miners. Loading China, as the world\u2019s biggest steel producer and therefore the largest consumer of iron ore \u2013 it imported about 1.24 million tonnes of ore last year \u2013 believes it should be able to have a more direct influence over its pricing. CMRG is now the biggest trader in the iron ore market, buying ore when prices are lower and selling it when prices are higher to remove the historical price volatility. With open-ended financial backing from the state, it has been able to build up a stockpile of ore thought to total about 20 million tonnes, both to enable it to trade and to provide a national strategic reserve. It has largely tamed what was previously significant speculative activity in the market.\n\nBut what it hasn\u2019t been able to do, yet, is to significantly shift the leverage in pricing negotiations away from the miners, even though the miners effectively face a near-monopsony buyer - a market with pretty much only one buyer. The structure of the market is, however, about to change. Loading Next month, Rio Tinto, its Chinese partner Chinalco and the Guinean government are expected to ship their first cargo of iron ore from the Simandou project in Guinea, the world\u2019s largest and richest undeveloped iron ore resource. While it probably won\u2019t be until next decade before the total Simandou project scales up to its planned output of 120 million tonnes a year \u2013 next year\u2019s production is expected to be about 10 million tonnes, rising to about 60 million tonnes in 2027 \u2013 it will introduce a new player, with the highest quality ore, into the market.\n\nIt won\u2019t be the lowest-cost producer, with the miners having to sink the best part of $US20 billion ($30.3 billion) into extensive rail and port infrastructure, including a new 620 kilometre-plus heavy haulage rail line and a new port. Its capital intensity will probably push it into the sector\u2019s third quartile for production costs. Its iron ore will, however command premium prices. Australian miners, particularly BHP and Rio, are able to leverage off their existing long-established infrastructure, their relative proximity to China, the ferrous content of their ore and their positioning at the low end of the cost curve. CMRG would be very mindful of the fact that not only is iron ore supply about to increase, but demand is starting to shrink. For much of its recent history, China has consistently produced about one billion tonnes of steel a year. This year it seems inevitable that it will fall short of that mark. In the first eight months of 2025, its mills produced 671.8 million tonnes, about 3 per cent less than in the same period last year.\n\nChina\u2019s steel industry, like most of the industries that Beijing regards as strategic, is awash with over-capacity, which has sparked ferocious price wars, a chronic lack of profitability and, with China\u2019s economic growth rate slowing, triggered a flood of exports that is adding to global trade frictions and generating pushback from other countries in the midst of Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars. Despite having a global market share of more than 50 per cent, the industry had, on average, negative profit margins last year. As part of his response to what the authorities call \u201cinvolution\u201d or \u201cneijuan\u201d \u2013 torrid price wars that drive losses because of excess capacity \u2013 Xi Jinping is trying to rationalise industries with chronic over-supply problems, and steel is at the forefront of those efforts. Instead of responding to pressures in the sector as it has in the past with a massive burst of infrastructure spending to boost domestic demand for steel, Beijing has developed a new steel industry plan that bans new capacity and forces the phasing out of outdated equipment to reduce its capacity, while targeting greater value-added products and lower emissions. With its steel output, and its demand for iron ore, having peaked and trending down, if Beijing is successful, and with a new source of supply entering the market, the structural shift in the balance of power that Beijing has long sought and which CMRG has been charged with is within sight.\n\nLoading That doesn\u2019t mean the Australian iron ore miners will be driven out of the market. They can all survive and make solid profits, at far lower prices than today\u2019s, which is around $US105 a tonne. The entry of new higher quality but high-cost ore is more likely to drive out other high-cost producers with low-grade ore. Price peaks might, however, be significantly lower, the market\u2019s pricing might become increasingly stable and there might be a more equitable power balance in negotiations between iron ore producers and their customers. The periods of super-profitability and extraordinarily fat margins might be ending, which helps explain why BHP and Rio are so intent on building major presences in other commodities, particularly copper. China\u2019s steel industry is, however, rationalising and consolidating, not disappearing.",

That\u2019s a great privilege. \u201cI remember when I first met Morry, he said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re the strangest person I\u2019ve ever met because you don\u2019t read magazines and all your friends are over 70\u2019.\u201d\n\nMorry is Schwartz\u2019s third husband Morry Schwartz, the developer-publisher and owner of Schwartz Media, which publishes The Saturday Paper, The Monthly, Quarterly Essay and Black Inc books. They married in 1993. She is clearly a private individual but Present Tense: Anna Schwartz Gallery and Thirty-Five Years of Contemporary Australian Art by Doug Hall (published by Black Inc) tells extraordinary stories of Melbourne\u2019s arts scene and Schwartz\u2019s life. The interconnectedness of Melbourne, its cultural and Jewish communities, is everywhere. Schwartz\u2019s paternal family arrived as Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Poland in 1938; Schwartz met art patrons John and Sunday Reed when she was 19. Her first husband, artist Joel Elenberg, a friend with artist Brett Whiteley, died from cancer aged 32. Schwartz, who remains close friends with Wendy Whiteley, later married the filmmaker Bob Weis in the 1980s. On page 74 of the book, a young Morry Schwartz is involved in a minor car crash. Elenberg and Weis \u2013 neighbourhood friends of his youth \u2013 were with him in the same car. Rock flathead with vermouth sauce at Gimlet. Credit: Simon Schluter Schwartz reports her entr\u00e9e \u2013 raw tuna with green olives and smoked chilli ($38) \u2013 as \u201cfaultless, fresh, delicious\u201d but \u201cnot too cheffy\u201d. \u201cMost restaurants I kind of recoil from, but anything Andrew produces I am really happy to eat.\u201d\n\nMy entr\u00e9e special of Spencer Gulf prawns with calamari ($48) contains braised butter beans which offset the seafood brilliantly. Schwartz labels our choice of mains \u201cunadventurous\u201d after we both order rock flathead with sorrel and vermouth sauce ($56). Schwartz requests her mussels be removed. It\u2019s comfort food meal in the European tradition of Gimlet, the sweet-flavoured fillets sitting upon an aromatic vermouth sauce. And yes, another glass of champagne. Each. Loading The press release announcing the move from Anna Schwartz Gallery to Anna Schwartz Projects contains a long list of contemporary artists the gallery and Schwartz herself had supported over the years, including Shaun Gladwell, Kathy Temin, Warwick Thornton, Justene Williams and Mike Parr. In December 2023 Schwartz severed ties after 36 years with Parr, a performance artist and longtime friend, after he had painted the words \u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cNazi\u201d during a performance piece in her gallery. The relationship was over, but Schwartz let the work remain on display.\n\nBut Schwartz will barely be drawn on the conflicts in Melbourne\u2019s cultural life over Gaza as she studies the crowd of diners and responds slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of various relationships with artists over the years. A lot of artists that the gallery had relationships with and then ceased. And so there\u2019s nothing so anomalous about that, really. \u201cOne always hopes at the inception of relationships, that they\u2019re going to flourish, and they often do for many years, and then, for various reasons, they come to an end.\u201d We are interrupted by a waiter. The moment is lost. Later I try again, with a question about the impacts of the Israel Gaza conflict on the Melbourne cultural scene.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t really want to discuss that,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an unnecessarily culturally divided time in Australia. I value a society which can support discussion \u2026 in a civilised, intelligent way.\u201d Loading She delivers a philosophical response, but how have the past couple of years been personally? \u201cWell, I guess my personal life and my career are two trajectories,\u201d Schwartz says thoughtfully, before continuing. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to use your teaspoon? Have a tiny bit? It\u2019s too much for me.\u201d She is distracting me with her serving of gelato. I succumb.\n\nOn other issues she is vocal, railing against some collectors. \u201cI think a lot of art collecting today is souveniring, buying the names. Anna Schwartz at Gimlet. Credit: Simon Schluter \u201cArt and culture are pluralistic, that there are all kinds of ways of living, seeing, collecting, whatever. I\u2019m not interested in that. I\u2019m interested in the kind of really serious presentation of ideas at the forefront of art practice as is generated by a long history, by a long trajectory of thinking and philosophising in this domain. That\u2019s where I find it worthwhile.\u201d She wants to show me the humour in the gallery\u2019s latest exhibition of artist Rose Nolan.",

(Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nAnalysis by online property marketplace Domain found the initiative would slash the time to save for a deposit in Sydney, for example, from 11 years to two or three years.\n\nHomebuyers in Melbourne and Brisbane will save five years and nine months, while Adelaide purchasers will have the deposit hurdle lowered by five years and seven months.\n\n\"This is life changing stuff and a genuine expansion of home ownership opportunities for that generation of Australians who are facing such a different housing market than their parents and grandparents faced,\" said Housing Minister Clare O'Neil.\n\nThe sooner a first home buyer can purchase a property, the sooner they can begin to build equity in their own home, rather than paying off a landlord's mortgage, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent.\n\nClare O'Neil says the need to get young people into the housing market is the primary concern. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nBut a lower up-front deposit meant more debt overall and a higher risk of slipping into negative equity if prices fell, noted Domain chief economist Nicola Powell.\n\nThe government believes tens of thousands of home buyers will take advantage of the scheme in its first year.\n\nPeter Tulip, chief economist at the Centre for Independent Studies, is concerned about first-home buyers racking up too much debt.\n\n\"It does address a real problem, but it does so in a fairly risky, dangerous way,\" he told ABC TV.\n\n\"It's going to encourage people to take one-way bets on the housing market.\"\n\nEconomists and the government agree the scheme will lift house prices, the question is by how much. (Diego Fedele/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nNationals senator Bridget McKenzie said the government was making the housing affordability crisis worse.\n\n\"They are increasing demand for housing supply by continuing their program of high immigration numbers,\" she told Seven's Sunrise.",
