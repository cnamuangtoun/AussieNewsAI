        "text": "TikTok just got another lifeline from the White House, with President Donald Trump set to delay enforcement of the sale-or-ban law by another 90 days.\n\n\"President Trump will sign an additional Executive Order this week to keep TikTok up and running,\" Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said in a statement.\n\n\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark.\n\nREAD MORE: Teen girl disappears in Queensland town overnight\n\nTikTok just got another lifeline from the White House, with President Donald Trump set to delay enforcement of the sale-or-ban law by another 90 days. (Nine)\n\n\"This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to ByteDance and TikTok for comment.\n\nIt's been about five months since a law requiring TikTok to be banned in the United States unless it's sold off by its China-based parent company technically went into effect.\n\nBut thanks to Trump's promises not to enforce the law, neither of those things have happened, aside from an approximately 14-hour blackout in January.\n\nThe announcement marks Trump's third extension of the ban.\n\nThe announcement means that the app will remain accessible for its 170 million American users despite the legislation that passed last year with bipartisan support over concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a US national security risk.\n\nAnd it comes as both the United States and China seek leverage in tense trade talks, in which TikTok appears to have become a bargaining chip.\n\nTuesday's announcement marks Trump's third extension of the ban. (AP)\n\nThe TikTok sale-or-ban law went into effect on January 19 after it was signed by former President Joe Biden last year.\n\nTikTok briefly took itself offline, sparking outcry from creators, but quickly came back after Trump signed an order delaying the ban's enforcement by 75 days.\n\nIt was one of his first acts as president, made in hopes of reaching a deal to keep the app \"alive\".\n\nIn April, a deal that would have transferred majority control of TikTok's US operations to American ownership was nearly finalised.\n\nBut it fell apart after Trump announced additional tariffs on China, forcing the president to announce another 75-day delay to keep the app operational in the US.\n\n\"There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" TikTok parent company ByteDance said after Trump's tariff policy stalled progress on the deal in April.\n\nThat pause was set to expire on June 19.\n\nTrump's latest enforcement delay raises questions about the status of a deal that could secure TikTok's long-term future in the United States.\n\nIn April, a deal that would have transferred majority control of TikTok's US operations to American ownership was nearly finalised. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)\n\nThe Chinese government has offered little public indication that it would be willing to approve a sale beyond suggesting that any deal could not include TikTok's \"algorithm\", which has been called the app's secret sauce.\n\nThe announcement comes after the US and China agreed on a framework to ease export controls, a move that's expected to ease tensions and prevent further escalation of export and other restrictions between the two countries.\n\nIt's not clear whether a TikTok deal is included in the framework, but cooperation between the two sides could make an agreement to transfer control of the app to a US buyer more likely.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump told reporters that a TikTok deal would \"probably\" require approval by the Chinese government and said, \"I think we'll get it.\"\n\n\"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it, yes,\" the US president added.\n\nThe deal that had been in the making earlier this year would have involved several American venture capital funds, private equity firms and tech giants investing in a company that would control TikTok's US operations.\n\nThe TikTok sale-or-ban law went into effect on January 19 after it was signed by former President Joe Biden last year. (AP)\n\nTikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would have retained a 20 per cent stake in the spinoff company \u2014 a key stipulation of the law.\n\nSeveral other high-profile bidders had also put their hands up to acquire the platform, including a group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and Shark Tank -famous investor Kevin O'Leary, Amazon, AI firm Perplexity and a separate group of investors that included YouTube and TikTok star Jimmy Donaldson, known online as MrBeast.\n\nIt was Trump who first tried to ban TikTok during his previous administration, but he has said he changed his mind after he \"got to use it\".",

        "text": "His was perhaps the most famous wrinkled brow in classical music, framing the bespectacled eyes of a pianist who penetrated to the very heart of the Austro-Germanic tradition like few others have ever done.\n\nNow, following his death at the age of 94, Alfred Brendel leaves behind a peerless recording legacy and a style of intelligent, insightful, and, above all, lyrical piano playing that continues in the work of his successful students.\n\nA peerless recording catalogue\n\nBorn in Moravia, now part of the Czech Republic, and spending his formative years mainly in Graz and Vienna, Alfred Brendel was destined to become a master of the Central European piano classics.\n\nHis discography on Vox, Decca and Philips among other major labels, says it all.\n\nHe recorded three sets of the Beethoven sonatas and concertos, two each of Schubert's later piano works and the Brahms concertos, one of the complete Mozart concertos, with plenty of Haydn, Liszt and Schumann thrown into the mix.\n\nBuilding a formidable career out of a late musical start\n\nA man of conspicuous intellectual acumen, Alfred Brendel's journey toward his stellar musical career was unusual, coming as he did from a not-especially-musical family and effectively having few real piano lessons beyond his mid-teens.\n\nLegends: Exploring the lives of classical music icons Photo shows Legends program graphic Experience the lives, inspirations and iconic recordings of the classical music legends. Tuesdays at 6pm and any time on the ABC listen app.\n\nBut his was an individual voice from the start, helped by an early interest in composition. At his professional recital debut at the age of 17 in Graz, he performed his own Piano Sonata which included a fearsome double fugue.\n\nThat youthful interest in composition informed his later piano playing, giving him what he called \"musical understanding\". It also helped him to establish his trademark desire to eschew personal glory in the interests of getting to the heart of what composers wanted and the music itself demanded.\n\nAlfred Brendel's recording career began inauspiciously in the early 1950s, when he was handed a reel-to-reel tape recorder and asked to perform the Prokofiev Fifth Piano Concerto, which he didn't know, with a modestly-credentialed orchestra.\n\nFrom then on, he became such a prodigious recording artist that modern listeners are still just as familiar with his sound as his contemporaries were.\n\nA unique performance and teaching style\n\nAlfred Brendel conducts a masterclass for the ABC's Half-hour program in 1966. (ABC Archive: Pearson)\n\nThe Brendel piano style featured remarkable finesse, a majestic sense of control and penetrating intelligence, imparting a sense of definitiveness to his interpretations.\n\nJust as with the man himself, some sensed a kind of aloof austerity in his performances, but both the man and the musician were far from that.\n\nFilled with wide-eyed curiosity and with interests that went well beyond music (poetry, painting and philosophy were lifelong passions), Brendel was also an inspiring teacher.\n\nModern British pianist Paul Lewis who, along with Imogen Cooper, studied with Brendel, recalls: \"Alfred was never interested in pianism for pianism's sake. For him, the piano was always a means to an end.\"\n\n\"In his own way he was very exacting as a teacher, but he was never interested in anything technical,\" Lewis says.\n\nBrendel lived in North London during the second half of his life but never lost his Central European accent.\n\nHaving played in all the world's great concert halls and with all the major orchestras over a 60-year-plus career, he gave up performing on the professional concert stage in 2008.\n\nBrendel continued to appear as a public-speaker, lecturer, and commentator. His writings on music have been justly lauded.\n\nMarried twice, he has four children, including cellist Adrian Brendel, co-founder of the Plush Music Festival in Dorset, where Alfred Brendel kept a country home.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

        "text": "Optus has admitted to engaging in unconscionable conduct and has agreed to a $100 million penalty for selling customers phones and contracts they did not want or need.\n\nThe consumer watchdog sued the telco in October over the practices, which affected hundreds of vulnerable customers.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said many of the affected consumers were vulnerable or experiencing disadvantage, including living with disability, being unemployed or having English as a second language.\n\nMany of the consumers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia, the ACCC said.\n\nOptus has admitted that its sales staff acted unconscionably when selling products and services to more than 400 consumers at 16 different stores across Australia between August 2019 and July 2023.\n\n\"I would like to sincerely apologise to all customers affected by the misconduct in some of our stores,\" Optus chief executive Stephen Rue said, describing it as \"inexcusable and unacceptable\".\n\n\" Optus failed these customers, and the company should have acted more quickly when the misconduct was first reported. \"\n\nThe ACCC and Optus will jointly ask the Federal Court to impose a total penalty of $100 million on the telco for breaching the Australian Consumer Law.\n\nThe regulator said it was a matter for the Court to decide whether the penalty was appropriate and to make other orders.\n\n'Simply unacceptable'\n\nThe misconduct included pressuring customers into purchasing large numbers of products, including expensive phones and accessories, that they did not want or need, could not use or could not afford.\n\nSales staff also failed to explain relevant terms and conditions, did not consider whether customers had Optus coverage where they lived, selling products customers could not afford and misleading people into thinking goods were free or part of a bundle at no additional cost.\n\nIn addition to the penalty, Optus has signed an undertaking to compensate affected customers and improve its systems.\n\n\"Impacted customers are receiving refunds as part of a remediation approach which is informed by financial counsellors and industry partners to make sure it is fair and reasonable,\" the telco said in a statement.\n\nACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe described the conduct as \"simply unacceptable\".\n\n\"Many of these consumers who were vulnerable or experiencing disadvantage also experienced significant financial harm. They accrued thousands of dollars of unexpected debt and some were pursued by debt collectors, in some instances for years,\" Ms Lowe said.\n\n\"It is not surprising, and indeed could and should have been anticipated, that this conduct caused many of these people significant emotional distress and fear.\n\n\"We are particularly concerned that Optus engaged debt collectors to pursue some of these consumers after it had launched internal investigations into the sales conduct.\"\n\nAt the now-closed Mount Isa store, the ACCC said Optus pursued debts even though senior management knew they related to contracts that were, or may have been, created without the knowledge of the affected customers.\n\n\"The majority of whom were First Nations Australians from Mount Isa and the Northern Territory,\" the regulator's statement said.",

        "text": "Restrictions around sexually active gay and bisexual men donating blood and plasma are being loosened in a new world-leading move by Australian Red Cross Lifeblood.\n\nUnder current rules, gay and bisexual men, and transgender women who have sex with men, cannot donate blood or plasma if they have had sex in the past three months.\n\nBut from July 14, in the first set of rule changes, Lifeblood will remove most restrictions on donating plasma related to sexual activity.\n\nIt has called this world-first the \"plasma pathway\", and says it will mean \"most people, including gay and bisexual men, and anyone who takes PrEP, will be able to donate plasma without a wait period, providing they meet all other eligibility criteria\".\n\nLoading...\n\nPrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis and involves HIV-negative people taking antiretroviral medication to protect them and prevent infection.\n\n\"Extensive research and modelling show that there will be no impact to the safety of the plasma supply with this change,\" Lifeblood said in a statement.\n\nLifeblood chief medical officer Jo Pink said plasma was now the donation Australians needed the most, and the change would allow more than 600,000 extra people to give blood.\n\n\"We're excited to be able to welcome more people from across the community into our donor centres from next month,\" Dr Pink told News Breakfast.\n\n\"We now anticipate an extra 24,000 donors and 95,000 extra donations of plasma to be made each year.\"\n\nDash Heath-Paynter, the CEO of Health Equity Matters, said the change \"potentially unlocks thousands of donations of life-saving plasma\".\n\n\"Members of the LGBQTIA+ community members can now help those whose lives depend on plasma donations without a donation deferral period,\" Mr Heath-Paynter said.\n\nPlasma is now the donation that is most needed by Australians. (Supplied: Australian Red Cross Lifeblood)\n\nChanges to blood donations coming\n\nAlongside the changes to plasma donation rules, Lifeblood is working towards making changes to blood and platelet donation eligibility.\n\nLifeblood said the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) had approved a submission to remove gender-based sexual activity rules.\n\nIt will mean that all donors will be given the same questions about sexual activity, regardless of gender or sexuality, once the changes come into effect.\n\nMen will no longer be asked if they have had sex with another man before they donate blood.\n\nChanges to blood donation rules could come into effect next year. (AAP: Angela Brkic, file photo)\n\nOn top of that, people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be able to donate blood and most people with new or multiple partners will also be able to donate if they have not had anal sex in the past three months.\n\nLifeblood has not given a date for when the changes will come into effect, but Dr Pink is hopeful of it being from early next year.\n\n\"There are many steps that Lifeblood needs to take before we can implement the new gender-neutral assessments, including working with state and territory governments to change the donor questionnaire,\" Dr Pink said.\n\nThese changes to blood- and plasma-donating rules will \"make it easier for more people in the LGBTQIA+ community to donate\" Dr Pink added.",

        "text": "After the wistful, what-if heartache of 2023's Past Lives, Celine Song has now set her sights on the zero-sum game of dating.\n\nFast Facts about Materialists What: A love triangle between a New York matchmaker, her ex and a wealthy, seemingly perfect suitor. Directed by: Celine Song Starring: Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, Pedro Pascal Where: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: Surprised\n\nMaterialists slyly presents as a glossy 2000s rom-com, a milieu well suited for the writer-director's elegant dialogue and her eye for luminous New York backdrops. There was every expectation that this anticipated follow-up \u2014 with its heftier budget and an A-list cast \u2014 would take a crowd-pleasing turn.\n\nInstead, Song takes on the genre with a contemporary cynicism. Her glamorous cosmopolitan setting is host to a trio of deluded, self-loathing characters, its Cinderella fantasy joylessly reduced to its class components.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC's Screen Show, Song outlines the film's primary tension: \"None of us are merchandise; we're people. So why is it that we treat ourselves, and each other, like we're merchandise?\"\n\nAt the centre of Materialists' love triangle is Lucy (a wry Dakota Johnson), a matchmaker whose craft revolves around a ruthless calculus of compatible incomes, ages, weights and heights between New York's elite. Dating is taken as a capitalist enterprise, with clients being assigned market value, then traded accordingly.\n\n\"I really wanted to work with Celine. I loved Past Lives. I loved meeting her even more. I loved the way she spoke about movies and people and feelings,\" Johnson told Elle. (Supplied: Sony)\n\nSong recalls her own experience in that profession, in which intimate desire and needs were defined by terms that felt more relevant to an insurance company or a morgue.\n\n\"That's the kind of language that they were using to describe the person who has to be the love of your life. The gap between that and what I knew about love, and what I know about love, felt so vast.\n\n\"That really fascinated and stressed me out, it's really the reason why I wanted to make this movie.\"\n\nTaking after Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, Pedro Pascal plays an old-money private equity investor, Harry, who's all too familiar with the rules of the game. He's the perfect suitor for Lucy, whose sole, immutable criterion for a mate \u2014 having watched her parents torn apart by financial hardship \u2014 is independent wealth. Beyond preventing a future of bickering over bills, Harry's considerable largesse makes her feel valued.\n\n\"Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and whatever. But now... we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs,\" Johnson told AP. (Supplied: Sony)\n\nLucy's ex-boyfriend, John (Chris Evans), is a struggling actor on the opposite end of New York's economic strata, still confined to the cramped apartment of his 20s. When they reunite at a wedding for one of Lucy's clients, he's working a side gig as a cater waiter, which barely keeps him afloat. Lucy playfully suggests they may be soulmates \u2014 but above all, he's a bad financial decision.\n\nIn screenings, Song found that the reveal of Harry's $12 million apartment could be relied upon to induce an audible response, no matter the audience.\n\n\"Wealth is the most seductive thing; it is the greatest drug that is possible in modern society,\" Song says.\n\n\"When you think about the Victorian romances, we have not come very far from talking about marriage and love only in relation to how much it's going to secure your life.\"\n\nPast Lives: review Photo shows A Korean man with short dark hair, in a navy shirt, and a Korean woman with dark bob, in a white shirt, are in a subway carriage Past Lives explores the past loves and missed connections that can haunt us.\n\nMaterialists is bracingly honest, even cruel, in its depiction of Lucy's world. Her myopic outlook has the underlying logic of pick-up artistry, in which sexual attraction can be distilled into formula, and courtship is merely bartering. She can only treat Harry's romantic proposition with an intense disbelief; why would a \"unicorn\" like him settle for someone like her?\n\nSong has a disarming way of testing the audience's own beliefs, in part because our engagement with dating apps and social media seems to affirm that same impoverished mindset. You won't see another film this year that so openly discusses the romantic odds for shorter men, which feels serendipitously timed with the recent announcement of Tinder's height filter.\n\nWhen Lucy describes a problem client, Sophie (Zo\u00eb Winters), as being a \"nice girl\" who's ultimately \"not competitive\", it's easy to relate to her thinking: dating apps are flooded with people whose best qualities are not on their surface.\n\nIt can be hard to see Chris Evans as a down-on-his-luck working-class man. (Supplied: Sony)\n\n\"Social media is contributing rapidly and very negatively towards the commodification of human beings \u2026 it just all becomes about expressing a value,\" the director says.\n\nThe more we buy into that system, the more we have to lose. \"Your whole life is going to be about modifying not just each other, but also yourself.\"\n\nThe messy, unsparing drama of Materialists doesn't always cohere with its knowing deployment of rom-com tropes. Passion is kept at a minimum while misery is laid on thick, with precious few jokes peeking through. Lucy's spiritual rot is broadened into staggering obliviousness, particularly in a subplot that indelicately handles the darker implications of her work.\n\nWhile Lucy's chemistry with Harry (or rather, Harry's assets) is deliberately distant, John doesn't quite inspire the kind of longing to work as a counterbalance \u2014 or perhaps there's an inherent disconnect between watching a star as bright as Chris Evans playing someone so downtrodden, even if his own acting career has been in the doldrums as of late.\n\nDakota Johnson told AP that Lucy's main question is: \"Do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need?\" (Supplied: Sony)\n\n(Naturally, Johnson is perfect at playing a character whose own aloofness seems to keep her at a distance from the human race, and relishes in dithering put-downs when the film calls for it.)\n\nMaterialists may well be a hostile viewing experience for unsuspecting audiences \u2014 it's certainly not recommended as a first-date movie. But the piercing clarity of Song's approach holds up once the shock wears off, and lays bare the inadequacies of how we negotiate romance.\n\n\"I'm always trying to depict a business deal of some kind; sometimes love is on the table, and sometimes it isn't.\"",

        "text": "Former CFMEU officials have lost a High Court challenge to changes to the Fair Work Act which forced the construction arm of the union into administration.\n\nThe takeover was announced in August last year with immediate effect, removing 270 union officers, mostly from volunteer positions, and 11 from paid jobs after allegations were raised about bullying, corruption, and criminal infiltration.\n\nThe union went straight to the High Court claiming the law which allowed for the administration was unconstitutional, that it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication, and was an acquisition of property on other than just terms.\n\nToday in a unanimous decision, the High Court threw out the case, clearing the way for the administration to continue.\n\nConstruction workers protested the federal government's take over on the steps of South Australian parliament last year. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nThe changes to the law came after allegations were aired in July last year that outlaw motorcycle gangs had infiltrated the union's branches.\n\nMedia reports alleged bikies had been appointed as delegates on major projects, amid wider claims of bullying, intimidation, and corrupt conduct.\n\nWeeks later the Fair Work Commission applied to the Federal Court to put the union in administration.\n\nIn the meantime, the federal government said if the union fought the administration, it would introduce the new laws adjusting the Fair Work Act, which it did.\n\nVictorian barrister Mark Irving KC was appointed as administrator.\n\nIn his first report to parliament in February, he said the High Court challenge had disrupted the process.\n\n\"Uncertainty about whether the former leadership is returning to power has, in some cases, impeded the Administration in obtaining full and frank disclosures from complainants.\" Mr Irving said.\n\n'A strong democratic, member-controlled Union'\n\nCFMEU generic (Graeme Powell)\n\nThe union made four arguments as to why the law should be struck down.\n\nCentral to its case was whether parliament had the power under the Constitution to make the law at all.\n\nThe government had argued the union was a trading organisation \u2014 since it collected membership fees \u2014 meaning it came under section 51(xx) of the Constitution.\n\nThere was also the question of whether the decision to put the union into administration was a punishment, and therefore an overreach of the executive government's powers.\n\nThe government argued nothing in the law infringed on \"human life, bodily integrity, or liberty\" and thus was not punitive.\n\nThe union argued the changes were an \"impermissible\" burden on the implied freedom of political communication.\n\nThat was because, by removing its officers, members are not represented by their chosen representatives, and are not free to engage in political activity with each other unless permitted by the administrator.\n\nGovernment strikes deal to pass CFMEU administration laws Photo shows A black sign with 'CFMEU Victoria' written on it, hanging on a construction site. The CFMEU will be forced to accept an administrator, as the federal government strikes a deal with the Coalition to pass laws to take control of the troubled construction union.\n\nThe Commonwealth told the High Court any burden was justified.\n\n\"It rationally advances [the] legitimate purpose, by taking control of the Division away from those who have failed to ensure its lawful, effective operation, and temporarily giving it to an Administrator charged with rectifying that in members' interests,\" the Commonwealth argued.\n\nThe final issue was whether the administration amounted to an acquisition of property on other than just terms.\n\nThe government rejected that, arguing in its submissions: \"It would be incongruous to require just terms to the CFMEU for the Administrator's work in cleaning up the [Construction] Division.\"\n\nThe Administrator, Mark Irving KC, has welcomed the decision, and what he described as the High Court's \"rejection of the attack on the legitimacy of the Administration\".\n\n\"The Administration is committed to returning the union to the membership as a strong democratic, member-controlled Union, enduringly free of corruption and criminal influence as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nAmanda Rishworth, Minister for Industrial Relations has welcomed the court's decision. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty)\n\nIn a statement, Workplace Relations Minister Amanda Rishworth said the federal government welcomed the court's decision.\n\n\"Construction workers deserve a union free from criminality, corruption and violence,\" Ms Rishworth said.\n\n\"The Administrator and his team can now move forward with confidence and continue their essential work in cleaning up the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU.\"",

        "text": "It pulled forward US imports and retail spending in March, with an associated bump in China\u2019s exports to America, which have since fallen away. US retail sales declined in April and May and China\u2019s exports to the US plunged 34 per cent last month. The fallout from the trade war also shows in China\u2019s economic numbers, with the tariff uncertainty hitting private investment hard. There was zero growth last month compared to May last year and foreign investment was down 13.4 per cent. It could cost China the golden chance that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d assault on trade and geopolitical alliances and multilateral institutions has created. The growth in fixed asset investment overall in China slowed from the 4 per cent in the first four months of the year to 3.5 per cent in the five months to end-May, even though manufacturing investment was up 8.5 per cent and public investment rose 5.9 per cent. The unusual feature of the May data was the unexpectedly strong growth in retail sales, which grew 6.4 per cent year-on-year, an acceleration from the 5.1 per cent rate experienced in April.\n\nThat\u2019s a reflection of Beijing\u2019s limited attempts to stimulate consumption via its subsidies for trade-ins of household appliances. Their sales soared 53 per cent, while mobile phones and other communication devices \u2013 also covered by the trade-in policy \u2013 jumped 33 per cent. The surge in exports to the US in March was driven by \u201cfront-loading,\u201d or a scramble by US importers to grab stock before the tariffs cut in. Donald Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping: While Trump has backed away from the 145 per cent tariff rate on China, the trade relationship remains unresolved. Credit: AP The retail sales splurge in China could be seen as analogous. The budget for the trade-in subsidies is capped, with some regional governments having already used up their quotas. The subsidies will have drawn forward spending, which makes the spike in sales a one-off event \u2013 once a household has bought a new washing machine, it\u2019s unlikely to be in the market for another for some time.\n\nThere may also have been some impact from an earlier-than-usual annual online shopping event, which may also have attracted forward spending from June. Loading In both economies, consumer confidence remains brittle \u2013 in the US because of the uncertainties generated by Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies and in China because of the continuing deterioration of its ravaged property markets, the repository for estimated 60 to 70 per cent of its middle-class wealth. Property prices continued to fall in May. After the market had appeared to stabilise earlier in the year following a range of policies introduced late last year aimed at shoring up the market, prices in April and May have started sliding again. Consumer confidence and spending will continue to remain weak until it is clear that the property market has bottomed out.\n\nFor China, with the stimulus funding budgets to tail off in the second half of the year and the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs likely to show up more materially as the year progresses, it will be a challenge to achieve Beijing\u2019s target of 5 per cent GDP growth this year. Exports have been booming, partly because of the front-loading of sales to the US but also because China\u2019s exporters have scrambled to diversify their markets. Some exports will inevitably have been re-routed to countries with lower tariffs, providing a backdoor entry to the US market. Others are displacing domestically produced goods in other economies, with the growth of exports to South-East Asia, Latin America and Europe causing increasing trade frictions and pushback from those economies, who face having their domestic manufacturing bases hollowed out if China\u2019s former export volumes to the US are diverted to their markets. China\u2019s broad strategy over the past decade \u2013 encouraging and subsidising exports while trying to create a self-sufficient domestic economy, one that doesn\u2019t rely on imports, by subsidising domestic companies, particularly those engaged in advanced manufacturing \u2013 isn\u2019t sustainable in the new trade environment.\n\nLoading Whatever the final shape of the trade relationship with the US, China\u2019s exports to the US will be lower than what they were before Trump regained the presidency, and China will experience increasing resistance from its other trade partners to any attempt to compensate for lost US volumes by redirecting those exports to their markets. In the longer term, China will have to do something about the excess capacity in its domestic manufacturing base, which reflects wasteful and increasingly unproductive over-investment, even if that means a lower economic growth rate. It will have to accept lower export volumes and do more to stimulate domestic consumption or face increased friction with all its trade partners that could create an existential threat to its current economic model. It could also cost China the golden chance that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d assault on America\u2019s traditional trade and geopolitical alliances and multilateral institutions has created \u2013 the opportunity to diminish America\u2019s dominance and elevate its own role in global affairs.",

The Fair Work Commission decision, handed down earlier this month , affects more than 2.6 million Australians and will apply from the first full pay period on or after 1 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of Australians will also see a boost to their Centrelink payments, with a 2.4 per cent increase to help ease the rising cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor families receiving Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A, the maximum rate of payment for children aged under 13 will increase to a new rate of $227.36 a fortnight. For children aged 13 or over, the rate will increase to $295.82 a fortnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum rate of Family Tax Benefit Part B will increase to $193.34, and for families with a youngest child aged five or over, the rate will increase to $134.96 a fortnight.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Super on top of paid parental leave: How new scheme will work and who will benefit\n\nThe FTB has been increased annually since its introduction in 2000, under both Labor and Coalition governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Services Minister Tanya Plibersek said in a statement the payments were essential for helping families manage the cost of raising children and that indexation is one way the government is making sure support keeps up with inflation.\n\n\n\nSuper increase\n\nThe superannuation guarantee, which is the minimum amount employers must contribute to their employees\u2019 super, is set to rise from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new rate applies to all salary and wages paid on or after 1 July, even if the work was performed before that date.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the increase, the federal government will start paying superannuation on its paid parental leave scheme for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paid parental leave superannuation contribution will apply to parents receiving government-funded parental leave pay on or after 1 July.\n\n\n\nPaid parental leave overhaul\n\nFrom 1 July, Australian families will benefit from a more generous paid parental leave scheme, with the amount of government-funded leave increasing from 20 to 22 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of the federal government\u2019s plan to progressively expand the scheme to 26 weeks by July 2026, the equivalent of six months of paid leave. Once fully rolled out, families will receive around $24,000 in total support following the birth or adoption of a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy is designed to give parents more time at home with their newborns and greater flexibility in how leave is taken. Parents can choose to take leave separately or at the same time, and spread it across two years, allowing for a staggered return to work or shared caregiving.\n\n\n\nImmigration changes for skilled workers\n\nThe government has made changes to Australia\u2019s skilled visa system in an effort to reduce worker exploitation and attract talent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new Core Skills Occupation List will replace the existing Skilled Occupation List, focusing on roles with genuine shortages.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployers will have to meet stricter criteria, including offering market salary rates and proving they\u2019ve advertised the job locally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs also announced that income thresholds for skilled visas will increase by 4.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis change will not apply to existing visa holders and nominations lodged before 1 July 2025.\n\n\n\nRoad rules get tougher\n\nNSW will introduce harsher penalties for drivers using their mobile phones.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1 July, those caught using their phone behind the wheel, even while stationary at traffic lights, can be fined up to $1,209 and lose five demerit points.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, the road rule requiring drivers to slow down to 40 km/h for emergency responders will now include tow truck, roadside assistance and incident response workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueenslanders will see a 3.4 per cent hike in vehicle registration fees as well as traffic fines.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationally, AI-powered surveillance cameras capable of detecting mobile phone use will be rolled out, as governments crack down on distracted driving.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians on a median wage will be able to retire in a good financial position, according to the peak body for the superannuation industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) projects a 30-year-old with a super balance of $30,000, earning the median wage of $75,000 until retiring at age 67, should accumulate $610,000 in super.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exceeds the figure ASFA says is needed for a \"comfortable\" retirement, which it estimates requires $595,000 in super for a single person living in their own home.\n\n\n\n\n\nA homeowner couple needs $690,000 in superannuation to reach the same level of financial security,\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the first time the body has predicted that someone on the median wage will reach that financial goal, since its reporting started in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts say it may take even less in superannuation to have a secure retirement, especially if you own your own home.\n\n\n\nWhat do the numbers show?\n\nThe ASFA retirement standard breaks down the cost of retirement, examining health insurance, basic living expenses, and other essential costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to estimates for the March 2025 quarter, a household with a 'comfortable lifestyle' \u2014 including a reasonable car, health insurance and an overseas trip \u2014 spends $73,875 per year for a couple who own their home and about $52,383 for a single homeowner.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, those living a 'modest lifestyle', the estimated annual budget was approximately $15,000 lower for singles than for couples living in their own home, typically spending less on health insurance, cars, and taking fewer holidays, among other expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile for renters living a 'modest lifestyle', a couple was estimated to have spent $64,259 and a single person $46,663 annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone on the age pension is estimated to spend $29,024 per year, and a couple $43,753, with both figures including supplements.\n\n\n\nAccording to estimates for the March 2025 quarter, a household with a 'comfortable lifestyle' spends $73,875 per year for a couple who own their home and about $52,383 for a single homeowner. Source: SBS News ASFA CEO Mary Delahunty attributed the rise in retirement affordability to higher super contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom July, employers will be required to pay 12 per cent of their employees' wages in superannuation, an increase of 0.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the 12 per cent super guarantee coming in, we can now say that the system foundations are cemented for young, working people to have a comfortable retirement. It's a moment all Australians should be proud of,\" Delahunty said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How a 'game-changing' new superannuation move will affect you\n\nHomeowners better off than renters\n\nJoey Moloney, the deputy director of the housing and economic security program at the Grattan Institute, told SBS News the real cost of retirement could be even lower, as retirees typically spend less once they stop working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you look at people's spending habits from pre-retirement to post-retirement, what you see is that people spend less in retirement and increasingly so as retirement goes on,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pensioners benefit from a bunch of discounts on council rates, electricity, medicines and other benefits that add up to an implicit income of thousands of dollars a year.\"\n\n\n\nFor people who have paid off their mortgage, they could have an extra 30 per cent of their income freed up rather than going into repayments, Moloney said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said most people who own their own homes would have a secure retirement, but the situation is different for renters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the data shows is that renters in retirement are actually typically doing it tough. Poverty rates are pretty high, and levels of reported financial stress are pretty high.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nHere at the Hardmission festival, they like to party - just as the sign says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe popular event at Werribee Racecourse in Melbourne's south-west was one of several sites selected as part of a pill testing trial in the state, after nine people were hospitalised from suspected overdoses in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan said at the time she was well aware that some festival goers included drugs in their party experience - and the government wanted to keep them safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that if a young person has a pill in their hand, they're at a music festival, they're intending to use it. Young people are also entitled to have access to health focused supportive advice about what is in that pill, and get the health advice that can then be wrapped around that young person.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state government says the pill testing trials have been a roaring success, with almost 1400 samples checked.\n\n\n\n\n\nMDMA, ketamine, and cocaine were the main drugs detected - but an estimated 11 percent of samples were not what the potential users expected their drugs to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the back of that trial, the Allan Labor Government has now named the location of Victoria\u2019s first fixed pill testing site in the inner north Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector Sarah Hiley has told Channel 9 it's going to be free and confidential when it opens in August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In this space, we'll actually have a private consultation room, the sample drop-off room. The lab is up at the end.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service will offer testing for most pills, capsules, powders, crystals, and liquids - and act as an early detection point for authorities on the lookout for highly dangerous synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and Nitazenes, which can be mixed with other drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health Minister Ingrid Stitt says it's about saving lives, not softening the government's stance on drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None of this means that it's legal to have drugs on you... This is a known drug use part of our city. So all those factors meant that this was a really good location.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement means Victoria joins the ACT in being the only two jurisdictions in Australia with a fixed pill testing site.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Queensland decided not to renew contracts for their own permanent testing sites at Brisbane's Bowen Hills and Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast, despite extremely potent synthetic opioids being found in Australian wastewater for the first time, substances up to 40 times more powerful than fentanyl.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Queensland Mental Health Commission has been tasked instead with developing an overdose monitoring system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision prompted Australian Medical Association Queensland president Dr Nick Yim to issue a statement that said without an early warning system like pill testing, he feared the closures would lead to higher rates of harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is disappointing the Crisafulli government, who was elected on a promise that they would listen to the experts, has once again dismissed the evidence supported by doctors... Without regulated testing, already vulnerable community members remain exposed to these hidden dangers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Tim Nicholls has stood by the decision to rip up the clinic contracts, citing the Liberal National Party's stance against drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's been backed by others in the government like small business minister Steve Minnikin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't believe there is any safe way to actually undertake illegal drugs. We will not be going down the pill testing path.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in other states, like New South Wales, pill testing sites are still not off the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a 12 month trial currently underway at music festivals across the state that Premier Chris Minns has previously said will run their course.\n\n\n\n",

And then she leaves them there to rot.\n\nThis is Mills\u2019 first, fully fledged science-fiction novel to portray the before and after of ecological apocalypse, but it continues her merging of the uncanny or speculative with her artistic instinct for spatial and psychological choreography. In other words, Mills\u2019 novels begin by asking: what kind of world is this? But the focus is always on what it feels like to inhabit these unusual worlds.\n\nThe Airways, Mills\u2019 previous novel, was ostensibly a queer fabulist horror story about a ghost seeking revenge. But this hook was masquerading a second, more experimental desire to assign a new form of language to this state of being. Dyschronia, which was short-listed for the 2019 Miles Franklin prize, ventured into weird fiction, imagining the desolation after the shore receded from an Australian coastal town, converting it overnight into a location of dark tourism \u2013 much to the chagrin of the few inhabitants who refused to leave. Taken all together, Mills\u2019 fiction continually returns to hauntings; her works explore how spectres from the past are eternally resurrecting in the present.",

US retail sales declined in April and May and China\u2019s exports to the US plunged 34 per cent last month. The fallout from the trade war also shows in China\u2019s economic numbers, with the tariff uncertainty hitting private investment hard. There was zero growth last month compared to May last year and foreign investment was down 13.4 per cent. It could cost China the golden chance that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d assault on trade and geopolitical alliances and multilateral institutions has created. The growth in fixed asset investment overall in China slowed from the 4 per cent in the first four months of the year to 3.5 per cent in the five months to end-May, even though manufacturing investment was up 8.5 per cent and public investment rose 5.9 per cent. The unusual feature of the May data was the unexpectedly strong growth in retail sales, which grew 6.4 per cent year-on-year, an acceleration from the 5.1 per cent rate experienced in April.\n\nThat\u2019s a reflection of Beijing\u2019s limited attempts to stimulate consumption via its subsidies for trade-ins of household appliances. Their sales soared 53 per cent, while mobile phones and other communication devices \u2013 also covered by the trade-in policy \u2013 jumped 33 per cent. The surge in exports to the US in March was driven by \u201cfront-loading,\u201d or a scramble by US importers to grab stock before the tariffs cut in. Donald Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping: While Trump has backed away from the 145 per cent tariff rate on China, the trade relationship remains unresolved. Credit: AP The retail sales splurge in China could be seen as analogous. The budget for the trade-in subsidies is capped, with some regional governments having already used up their quotas. The subsidies will have drawn forward spending, which makes the spike in sales a one-off event \u2013 once a household has bought a new washing machine, it\u2019s unlikely to be in the market for another for some time.\n\nThere may also have been some impact from an earlier-than-usual annual online shopping event, which may also have attracted forward spending from June. Loading In both economies, consumer confidence remains brittle \u2013 in the US because of the uncertainties generated by Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies and in China because of the continuing deterioration of its ravaged property markets, the repository for estimated 60 to 70 per cent of its middle-class wealth. Property prices continued to fall in May. After the market had appeared to stabilise earlier in the year following a range of policies introduced late last year aimed at shoring up the market, prices in April and May have started sliding again. Consumer confidence and spending will continue to remain weak until it is clear that the property market has bottomed out.\n\nFor China, with the stimulus funding budgets to tail off in the second half of the year and the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs likely to show up more materially as the year progresses, it will be a challenge to achieve Beijing\u2019s target of 5 per cent GDP growth this year. Exports have been booming, partly because of the front-loading of sales to the US but also because China\u2019s exporters have scrambled to diversify their markets. Some exports will inevitably have been re-routed to countries with lower tariffs, providing a backdoor entry to the US market. Others are displacing domestically produced goods in other economies, with the growth of exports to South-East Asia, Latin America and Europe causing increasing trade frictions and pushback from those economies, who face having their domestic manufacturing bases hollowed out if China\u2019s former export volumes to the US are diverted to their markets. China\u2019s broad strategy over the past decade \u2013 encouraging and subsidising exports while trying to create a self-sufficient domestic economy, one that doesn\u2019t rely on imports, by subsidising domestic companies, particularly those engaged in advanced manufacturing \u2013 isn\u2019t sustainable in the new trade environment.\n\nLoading Whatever the final shape of the trade relationship with the US, China\u2019s exports to the US will be lower than what they were before Trump regained the presidency, and China will experience increasing resistance from its other trade partners to any attempt to compensate for lost US volumes by redirecting those exports to their markets. In the longer term, China will have to do something about the excess capacity in its domestic manufacturing base, which reflects wasteful and increasingly unproductive over-investment, even if that means a lower economic growth rate. It will have to accept lower export volumes and do more to stimulate domestic consumption or face increased friction with all its trade partners that could create an existential threat to its current economic model. It could also cost China the golden chance that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d assault on America\u2019s traditional trade and geopolitical alliances and multilateral institutions has created \u2013 the opportunity to diminish America\u2019s dominance and elevate its own role in global affairs.",

        "text": "Australia is tearing down outdated blood donor barriers \u2014 lifting bans that have excluded LGBTQI+ people, and rewriting rules with fair, gender-neutral screening.\n\nAustralia is making significant strides in modernising its blood and plasma donation policies to be more inclusive and evidence-based. Source: Getty\n\nIn a world-leading move, Australia is lifting restrictions that have long prevented many gay, bisexual and transgender people from donating plasma, with historic changes to blood donation screening set to follow next year amid critical shortages.\n\nFrom July 14 most sexual activity-based wait times will be removed for plasma donation, including for people taking PrEP [a tablet to prevent HIV infection], allowing tens of thousands more people to donate.\n\nInclusive, gender-neutral rules for blood donation have also been approved and are expected to be implemented in 2026, bringing an end to gendered screening questions and marking a major shift in how all donors are assessed. That means any person, regardless of their sexual orientation, will have to follow the same criteria to donate, removing specific questions targeting gay, bisexual and trans women who have sex with men.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News Australia on Wednesday morning, a Lifeblood spokeswoman said the changes were a long time in the making.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It's a rigorous process when any changes happen in the health system, but we've gotten there,\" she said. \"So from the 14th of July, restrictions are lifted on plasma \u2014 meaning gay, bi, trans and PrEP users can donate plasma without a wait time \u2014 that includes sex workers and some other groups.\n\n\"The estimate, done by the Kirby Institute, is that this change could affect around 600,000 people. The only restriction that remains in place is if you have HIV, or if you have a partner with HIV.\"\n\nInclusive, gender-neutral rules for blood donation have also been approved and are expected to be implemented in 2026. Source: Getty\n\nHow do blood donations work in Australia?\n\nAustralia\u2019s donated blood is rigorously tested at every stage \u2014 including screening for blood type, antibodies, HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and bacterial contamination \u2014 performed in TGA\u2011licensed labs to ensure only safe blood reaches patients, with any positive samples destroyed immediately.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlood is made up of several components, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Plasma is the clear, yellowish liquid portion that carries these cells, along with nutrients, hormones, and proteins, throughout the body. While whole blood donations include all components, plasma donations collect only the liquid part, which can be processed and used to treat a variety of medical conditions, such as immune disorders and clotting problems.\n\nUnder the new system, people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood. Those with new or multiple partners may also be eligible, provided they haven\u2019t had anal sex in the past three months.\n\nImportantly, men will no longer be singled out and asked if they\u2019ve had sex with another man \u2014 a major step toward a more inclusive and stigma-free donation process. \"Questions for all donors will instead be replaced with: 'Do you have a new partner?' and 'Have you been having anal sex in the last three months with this new partner?\" the spokeswoman explained.\n\n\"That will mean a wait time if you have, but if it\u2019s a monogamous relationship and it\u2019s not a new partner, then you\u2019ll be able to donate. And men and women will both be asked the same questions.\"\n\nNow, Australia is at the forefront globally in modernising blood and plasma donation policies to be more inclusive and evidence-based. We now join a small but growing group of countries prioritising safety while reducing stigma for LGBTQ+ donors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSimilar gender-neutral donation systems have been implemented in countries like the United Kingdom and Italy, where questions focus on individual sexual behaviour rather than identity, allowing more people to donate safely. However, Australia\u2019s move to eliminate wait times for plasma donation among PrEP users and men who have sex with men places it among the world leaders in progressive, scientifically informed donor eligibility.\n\nLGBTQI+ campaigners have long championed such a change, with advocates welcoming the announcement on Wednesday.\n\n\"About bloody time! Gay and bisexual men have some of the highest levels of sexual health practice and literacy, and I look forward to joining gay and bisexual men across Sydney and Australia in donating blood,\" Member for Sydney Alex Greenwich said.\n\nSafety for donors remains Lifeblood's 'top priority'\n\nLifeblood\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jo Pink, said given that the plasma is the donation type most needed by Australian patients, the change couldn't come at a better time. Pink said the safety and well-being of patients who receive donations remains, as always, at the forefront in decision-making.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWith more than 600,0000 people estimated to be covered by the previous wait times, we now anticipate an extra 24,000 donors, and 95,000 extra donations of plasma to be made each year,\" she said. \"There are many steps that Lifeblood needs to take before we can implement the new gender-neutral assessments, including working with state and territory governments to change the donor questionnaire. We hope to be able to implement this part of the change next year.\n\n\"Blood safety is and always will be our top priority, but we know the current donation rules have been very difficult for many people in the LGBTQIA+ community. While they were put in place to ensure a safe blood supply in the past, we know that they\u2019ve contributed to the stigma faced by the community.\n\n\"We hope as we move through the process of seeking to have both these changes introduced, this will be a turning point for both Lifeblood and the LGBTQIA+ community.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "The spike in animal cases could be bad news for humans, as the unthinkable spread of rat lungworm continues.\n\nWhile rat lungworm infections are on the increase in dogs, it's uncommon for humans to ingest it by eating salad in Australia. Source: Getty/University of Sydney\n\nA tiny parasite that can infect human brains has the potential to change our way of life in Australia, threatening not only our health but what we eat. Originally from Southeast Asia, rat lungworm is now established along our east coast, with infections found as far south as Jervis Bay.\n\nUniversity of Sydney research has linked spikes in infections of the worm in animals to heavy rainfall, because the worm is commonly found in slugs and snails that proliferate during wet weather. A study of 93 dog infections in Sydney and Brisbane found 32 occurred directly after a single rain event, which were likely triggered after pets came into contact with common garden molluscs. The researchers found risk was elevated for between two and 10 months after heavy rain.\n\nThe study's senior author, Jan \u0160lapeta from the Sydney School of Veterinary Science, told Yahoo News it's unclear how far south the parasite will spread. But with the world's weather becoming warmer and wetter, it's possible it could one day make its way down to Melbourne.\n\n\"It has the potential to spread further. An indicator is that 20 or 30 years ago, we did not talk about it in America or Europe. Now it's in the southern states of the United States, it's creeping into Europe, it's in Spain,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I think climate change is very much helping this parasite spread further.\"\n\nNew invasive species could 'dramatically' increase infections\n\nInteractions with slugs and snails are the most common way for people to become infected, either by accidentally or intentionally eating them, or by consuming unwashed salad they\u2019ve had contact with. In 2010, a Sydney man died after he ate a slug following a dare.\n\nIt's unusual for anyone in Australia to eat an infected snail because of their large size, but that could change if there's a similar biosecurity breach to what has occurred in Hawaii.\n\nIt's on the Big Island that a tiny semi-slug, Parmarion martensi, has invaded the landscape. It's so small that it's easy to accidentally consume when eating salad greens and fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"You can't wash them off or see them. The number of human cases [of rat lungworm] have increased dramatically,\" \u0160lapeta said. \"In Australia we do not have this semi-slug. Is there a potential? We can't yet tell. But we have areas up north that are similar to Hawaii. I don't want to be an alarmist, but this parasite could create more havoc.\n\n\"If this semi-slug comes in, then it might end up on the veggies that people have got in their backyards. And that would change the landscape of this disease completely, like it changed in Hawaii.\"\n\nThe semi-slug would complete a cocktail of invasive species that \u0160lapeta doesn't want to see become established in Australia.\n\n\"The parasite is invasive, the rat is invasive, the European slugs that we see in the backyards of Sydney are invasive, but if we bring in the semi-slug... it could change the way we grow greens and behave in restaurants,\" he said.\n\nRat lungworm originated in Southeast Asia, but it's now found in Australia. Source: University of Sydney\n\nThe first sign rat lungworm has reached your city\n\nThe first sign the worm has reached a city is usually that animals in its zoo have become sick, with curious primates often picking up slugs inside their cage and then becoming sick. Reports made by wildlife rescue volunteers are also useful in monitoring its spread, as tawny frogmouths and possums often get sick in large numbers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince rat lungworm, also known as Angiostrongylus cantonensis, was first detected in Brisbane in the 1970s, at least six people have been infected, two of whom have died.\n\nWhen it comes to infections in people, most are asymptomatic, and many cases likely aren't diagnosed.\n\nWhy do people become sick from rat lungworm?\n\nDuring its first phase of life, rat lungworm larvae hatch in the lungs of rats and is then passed through the animal as faeces. Slugs and snails consume that faeces and the worms grow inside of them. Rats then eat the slugs and snails and the process begins again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe process is relatively harmless to slugs, snails and rats, but in other hosts like humans, dogs or native birds and mammals, the body can overreact and try to kill the parasite. On rare occasions, it causes an infestation in the brain that triggers an immune response that causes inflammation. Symptoms normally set on between one and three weeks after a slug or snail is eaten, and include headaches, nausea, vomiting, a stiff neck, pain in the skin and fever.\n\nWhat can we do about the spread of rat lungworm?\n\nThe University of Sydney study on rat lungworm infections in dogs advocates for a One Health approach to combating the parasite.\n\nThis concept means recognising that animals and humans live in the same environment and are therefore interconnected. But how best to respond to the problems it's causing is something that's left \u0160lapeta stumped.\n\n\"That's the million dollar question. The parasite is moving wherever it wants,\" he said. \"We can't eliminate rats, we can't eliminate slugs, so we just have to be more vigilant around the clinical signs in our pets and ourselves.\n\n\"But there's not much we can do about tawny frogmouths. They will keep looking for some sort of food, and if the slug or snail is infected then they will become infected too.\"\n\nThe lead author of the study into rat lungworm in dogs was Sydney University's Phoebe Rivory. The research was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
