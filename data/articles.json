It's made $20 million in sales since. (Supplied)\n\nA 2024 report showed that, of the 55 per cent of Aussies who hoped to start a small business or side hustle by 2030, most were motivated by the idea of a better income.\n\nBut Maddy, 26, just wanted a way out of her dull corporate job when she and Dylan started Candy Claws.\ufeff\n\n\"It was my first corporate job out of uni, and I was really young,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"I'd always wanted to do my own thing, so I was like, 'I'm just going to start it now and see how it goes.'\"\n\nLooking for an extra buck? These are Australia's top side hustles View Gallery\n\nThe idea for a press-on nail business struck her in the aisles of her local chemist.\n\nLike many young Aussies, \ufeffMaddy couldn't \ufeffafford to get her nails done at a salon every few weeks in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nBut the \ufeffpress-ons available at her local shopping centre looked cheap, felt flimsy and fell off within a few hours.\n\n\"I was like, what if you could create press-ons that looked and felt like a salon manicure, and lasted weeks rather than days?\" she said.\n\nDylan, 30, was totally on board with the idea.\n\nThe siblings started looking into manufacturers right away and pooled a few hundred dollars from their savings accounts to pay for the first batch of Candy Claws nails.\n\nOrders started coming in soon after.\n\nMaddy spent ages packing orders by hand in Candy Claws' early days. (Supplied)\n\nBy that stage, Maddy had quit her corporate job, so she had all stock delivered to her place, where she packed thousands of orders in her living room.\n\n\ufeff\"I couldn't even get through my front door some days when we just got a stock order in,\" she laughed, but the inconvenience quickly paid off.\n\nAs soon as the first batch of nails sold out, she and Dylan invested all their earnings into paying for the next batch.\n\nWithin the first month, Candy Claws had made $6000 in sales.\n\nBy the end of the first year, it had hit $1 million.\n\nNow the business is approaching the $20 million mark, has moved into a proper warehouse and office, and Maddy and Dylan are both working on it full-time.\n\nThe brand has also \ufeffexpanded to New Zealand and the UK, with plans to explore the US market in the future \u2013 hopefully once the Trump administration's import tariffs have been lifted.\n\nMaddy and Dylan have since moved the business into a proper warehouse space. (Supplied)\n\nSo what made it work when so many side hustles fail?\ufeff\n\nAccording to Maddy, it was hard work, careful money moves, and \ufeffinvesting in social media advertising.\n\n\"We couldn't really afford to hire content creators at the start,\" she said.\n\n\"So I just accepted that I was going to have to be the one to get in front of the camera and talk about the brand [and] we quickly picked up on the fact that that's what people liked.\"\ufeff\n\nNow they have more than 70,000 Instagram followers.\n\nFounder-forward brands can do extremely well on social media, where small business and entrepreneurial content has been booming of late.\n\nPress-on\ufeff nails have also enjoyed a massive spike in popularity recently, both online and in Aussie shopping carts.\n\nCandy Claws has more than 70,000 Instagram followers and a huge customer base now. (Supplied)\n\nThe global press-on nail market size was estimated at $US696.6 million ($1 billion) in 2023 and is projected to hit $US1 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nMore than \ufeff2.6 million TikTok videos and 6.5 million Instagram posts are tagged #pressonnails, reflecting a shift towards more cost-effective beauty options amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nMany Aussies have been forced to cut back on luxuries like gel or acrylic manicures to prioritise essentials, making press-ons a popular alternative.\n\n\"It's the cost-saving element, but also the time-saving element,\" Maddy said.\n\n\ufeffCandy Claws' biggest customer groups are Aussie mums who don't have the time or money to get a manicure and pensioners who can no longer afford trips to the salon.\n\nAnd with the cost of living crisis showing no signs of easing, it looks like Candy Claws' business will be booming for some time to come.\ufeff\n\nHave you got a story?

        "text": "The number of endangered Gouldian finches at a critical site in the far north of Western Australia has halved in the past year, according to a new population count.\n\nConservation charity Save the Gouldian Fund has just completed its annual survey of the colourful birds in Wyndham \u2014 home to the largest known population of the species \u2014 located about 3,300 kilometres north-east of Perth in the East Kimberley.\n\nOnce among the most common finches found across northern Australia, Gouldian numbers have plummeted over the past century, from hundreds of thousands to an estimated 2,500 in the wild.\n\nGouldian finch numbers appear to be declining in the Wyndham region. (Supplied: Kacie Austin)\n\nSave the Gouldian Fund chief executive Gary Fitt said the population in Wyndham had been steadily falling.\n\n\"In 2023, we were counting on average about 1,700 Gouldians a day,\" Dr Fitt said.\n\n\"The following year, it dropped to 1,500.\n\n\"Last year was 1,200, and this year, under 500.\"\n\nLack of rainfall causes decline\n\nDr Fitt attributed the sharp decline to poor wet season rainfall earlier in 2025, which likely stunted the growth of native sorghum, a key food source for the birds.\n\nHe also raised concerns about frequent burning around Wyndham, which could destroy nesting habitat and force the birds to travel further in search of food.\n\n\"The level of fires and level of burning around Wyndham is really concerning,\" he said.\n\nGouldian numbers have plummeted over the past century. (Supplied: Bruce Doran)\n\n\"Because that means the birds have to move around a lot more to find what remaining food there is.\"\n\nDespite the drop, Dr Fitt remained optimistic.\n\n\"I think if there's a good wet season next year and there's plenty of sorghum, the numbers may well come back up,\" he said.\n\n\"The numbers that we're seeing now are still well above what we were seeing back in the late 1990s, as the population was declining to the point where the bird was declared endangered.\"\n\nWA government under investigation\n\nThe low numbers in Wyndham come as the federal government investigates whether the WA government has breached environmental conditions tied to protecting Gouldian finches in the nearby Ord Valley.\n\nThe WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) is behind the Weaber Plain Development Project, also known as the Goomig Project \u2014 a large-scale irrigation scheme involving the clearing of nearly 10,000 hectares of land.\n\nThe WA government is under federal investigation over conservation zones in the Ord Valley. (ABC Kimberley: Alys Marshall)\n\nWhen the project was approved in 2011, the federal government imposed strict environmental conditions, including an 11,545-hectare buffer zone and installation of artificial nest boxes to support Gouldian finches.\n\nBut in the past five years, surveys have found no evidence the endangered birds were using the nest boxes within the protected area.\n\nAustralian Conservation Foundation national nature campaigner Jess Abrahams said the WA government was failing to meet its obligations.\n\n\"We are seeing Gouldian finches disappear from parts of the landscape that are no longer suitable to support them, and that's a real tragedy,\" he said.\n\n\"If governments continue to approve the destruction of their habitat, continue to fail to act on climate change, if agricultural production continues to encroach on its habitat, I do fear that Gouldian finches will be a thing of the past in this part of Australia.\"\n\nDPIRD said it recorded Gouldian finch activity in the environmental buffer zone in 2025 through acoustic monitoring trials, which detected juvenile and adult Gouldian finch calls throughout the day, and visual surveys.\n\n\"Despite the demonstrated presence of Gouldian finches in the general area, the artificial nesting boxes installed to satisfy Weaber Plain development requirements remain unoccupied,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"Survey and trial results will form part of DPIRD's federal compliance reporting obligations for the Weaber Plain development.\"\n\nThe federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has not yet released the findings of its investigation.\n\nA spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment while the process was ongoing.",

        "text": "Last week's Media Watch raised some fascinating questions about political reporting in Canberra.\n\nIn one segment, host Linton Besser talked about the culture of \"drops\".\n\nA \"drop\" is when a political reporter is given a story under embargo, which means the story can't be published before a certain time.\n\nBut a norm has existed for decades, for a particular kind of drop, that finds journalists agreeing to run a story, given to them by a government or opposition MP, on the proviso that they don't include any quotes from third parties in the first version of their story.\n\nIf you didn't see the Media Watch segment, it's worth watching.\n\nSee the segment below.\n\nIt suggests that the culture of strings-attached drops has become more blatant in Canberra in recent years.\n\nLoading...\n\nIs it time for the practice to end, as Besser suggested?\n\nBecause if we want it to end, the press gallery will have to overcome its collective action problem.\n\nA glutton for punishment\n\nA quick anecdote.\n\nOne of the most memorably abusive phone calls I've received in my time in Canberra came from a staffer in then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's office.\n\nThat staffer was an ex-journalist.\n\nI was working at Guardian Australia at the time, in 2018, when Turnbull decided to announce his plan to turn Australia into one of the world's top 10 weapons exporters.\n\nAustralia's Future Fund invests in the global arms industry Photo shows Loyal Wingman plane in flight Would the Future Fund's financial returns suffer if it stopped investing in the global arms industry?\n\nI was working the Sunday shift that day, as a political reporter, so I was sent the \"drop\" to write up the story for online.\n\nThe story was embargoed until 8pm that evening (if I recall), which meant lots of news outlets would be publishing the story that evening.\n\nThe long-established \"norm\" for that kind of drop was that, when you wrote the story up, you couldn't include comments from opposition MPs or other third parties in your initial article, because it was a major policy announcement from the government.\n\nBut there was no rule that said you couldn't provide political context in the story.\n\nSo, when I wrote the story up, I included this context in my article:\n\nThe controversial plan has been anticipated since mid-2017 when Christopher Pyne, the defence industry minister, said he wanted to start selling far more Australian-made weapons overseas. At the time, Tim Costello, the World Vision Australia chief advocate, attacked the plan, saying the government had cut humanitarian aid which saved lives while simultaneously discussing the merits of becoming a major weapons manufacturer and exporter. \"The government says this is an export and investment opportunity, but we would be exporting death and profiting from bloodshed,\" Costello said last year. \"There is only one purpose in making a weapon and that is to kill someone with it. Do we really want that to be what people think of when they see the brand 'made in Australia'?\" Costello said at the time that the contemporary Syrian war \u2014 now in its eighth year \u2014 could not have lasted for more than a year without armaments profiteering. As a result, there had been more than 300,000 people killed, including thousands of children, 13.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 6.3 million people internally displaced and 5 million people turned into refugees.\n\nI filed the story and went home.\n\nThe initial headline on the story included the phrase \"exporting death\" or \"profiting from bloodshed\" (I can't remember which), which was a reference to the criticism that Tim Costello had made of the idea six months earlier, to which I'd alerted readers.\n\nAnd an hour or so after the story went live that night, I was in my kitchen cooking dinner when I got a phone call from Turnbull's staffer.\n\nHe was furious. He accused me of breaking the norm for drops.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nHe said I'd gone to Tim Costello for a quote.\n\nI tried to explain to him that I hadn't gone to Costello. That quote in my story from Costello was six months old. Costello had made that criticism of the Coalition's policy in July 2017 when the idea was floated by Christopher Pyne.\n\nBut he was having none of it. His anger had shut his brain down.\n\n\"You're a f***ing disgrace,\" he seethed.\n\n\"You're a s*** journalist. You're pathetic. This is journalism 101. You don't deserve to be in the gallery. You're not good enough.\"\n\nOn and on it went. A stream of personal abuse.\n\nA collective action problem\n\nNow, generally speaking, it hasn't been my experience that editors care that much if their journalists get verbally abused by staffers or politicians, unless the abuse is turned up to 11.\n\nThey're too busy with other things. We're all adults. And what could they do about it anyway?\n\nLabor to water down transparency laws, allow blanket FOI refusals Photo shows Albanese water The government will argue the \"proper functioning\" of government is hampered by disclosure laws and push for wide-ranging restrictions on the information that can be released to the public.\n\nBut there's not enough recognition from editors that journalists in the press gallery are trapped in a toxic dynamic when they're expected to keep staffers and MPs on side, regardless of how they're treated, so they don't miss any \"drops\" on big policy announcements.\n\nIt's a gross situation to be put in, and it creates an intolerable power imbalance in the staffer's favour.\n\nWhy do some daily news editors care so much about drops?\n\nBecause they hate waking up in the morning to discover that a rival news outlet has a big story on a major policy announcement and their own outlet doesn't have the same story.\n\nWhy don't they just refuse to take drops that come with strings attached?\n\nBecause if one news outlet in the press gallery is willing to accept such drops, other news outlets feel pressure to accept such drops too.\n\nThe fear is that, if your news outlet never accepted drops with strings attached, your rival (which had no qualms about it) would look like the agenda-setting news outlet that always had the big policy announcements, and you'd always look like you were chasing your rival's coverage.\n\nFor the press gallery, it's a collective action problem.\n\nThe gallery has the power to kill the culture of strings-attached drops in Parliament House. If every news outlet in the hallway believed it was in their collective interest to do so, and they acted as one, they could kill the practice tomorrow.\n\nBut who expects that to happen?\n\nThe temptation for one news outlet to break away from any gallery pact, to get the \"scoop\" on their rivals with a juicy drop that kicked off the next major news cycle, would be too great.\n\nAnd once that happened once, other outlets would go back to receiving strings-attached drops again.\n\nThere's a solution\n\nHow does the press gallery break out of that logic?\n\nIn last week's Media Watch, the segment included a quote from the Sydney Morning Herald's Peter Hartcher.\n\nMr Hartcher said when reporters received a drop from an MP's office, they should simply ignore any demand that the initial write-up of the drop can't include quotes from third parties.\n\n\"Reporters should ignore this unethical constraint and remember that their main responsibility is to their readers, viewers and listeners, not their sources,\" he said.\n\nBut Hartcher should know that that's not how the world works.\n\nAs the media works to win trust, people say they want the truth Photo shows A graphic showing someone looking at their phone with social media icons around their head. Australians want journalists to tell the truth. Is that a simple request?\n\nLowly ranked individual journalists in major newsrooms can't just refuse to do that, if they want to keep their job.\n\nThey'd need to know that their editors backed them first.\n\nAnd that would require editors announcing to their newsrooms that no more stories will be published based on drops, if the drops come with certain demands from an MP's office.\n\nSometimes you'll see an editor trying to improve the quality of their political coverage by telling their political reporters that they won't be publishing any more stories that include quotes from anonymous sources.\n\nThey could issue a similar diktat for drops, if they wanted to.\n\nAnd if they did that, they might be surprised to see how quickly it would rebalance the power dynamic between their journalists and the MPs and staffers their journalists have to deal with.\n\nIn one move, it would create a slightly better working environment for their journalists in Canberra, and it would strip some power from arrogant MPs and staffers who consider it their right to have some news framed in certain ways by controlling the flow of information through the press gallery with divide-and-conquer tactics.\n\nEditors could even use that editorial policy to their market advantage by loudly publicising the fact that their news outlet doesn't accept strings-attached drops, but their rivals do.\n\nIf they don't respect the way their rivals \"do news,\" why would they want to mimic them anyway?\n\nAnd if morning TV and radio hosts felt the need to follow a drop-based story from a rival news outlet one morning, they could tell their listeners that the story was clearly a drop, and that's why they're interrogating it now.\n\nWho cares if a \"norm\" has existed for decades?\n\nIf we think the press gallery should still exist as an institution, there's no reason why a few practices shouldn't be overhauled for the 21st century.",

(ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\nExercise is reframed as everyday movement \u2014 not gym workouts or costly routines \u2014 but simple tasks like cleaning the house or walking around town.\n\n\"In Collarenebri, we don't have a gym, but we do have a beautiful river and a small community that's safe to walk around,\" Ms Caine said.\n\n\"I'm not asking people to buy expensive weights, I'm asking them to get that can of food out of your cupboard and use that.\"\n\nCommunity part of the cure\n\nOne of Collarenebri's approximately 600 residents, Kellie Henderson discovered she had diabetes in a consultation with Ms Caine 12 months ago.\n\n\"It came as a great big shock,\" she said.\n\nSince joining the program, the 44-year-old has lost almost 30 kilograms, reduced her blood sugar to near-normal levels and reshaped her daily habits.\n\nRishoniy Caine says people can exercise with whatever they have on hand, like canned food or even rocks. (ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\n\"I find things fun \u2014 just going for a walk, time to myself, experimenting with different foods,\" she said.\n\n\" If something's worrying me, I'll just ask Rishoniy and she'll explain the good and the bad of it. She's been honest and has explained things to me in a way that I could actually understand. \"\n\nRishoniy Caine shows Kellie Henderson how to prepare a diabetes-friendly meal. (ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\nMs Henderson said she still had \"ups and downs\" but felt better supported than in the past.\n\n\"I'm determined not to go back to where I was,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm feeling a lot happier.\"\n\nA model for other communities\n\nMs Caine said restoring cultural and community connection was as important as managing physical health.\n\n\"If you don't look after your body, your mind is not well, and if you don't look after your mind then your spirituality and connection to your community and your culture is not well either,\" she said.\n\nEarly results from the pilot program show improvements in weight, blood sugar levels, mood and social connection.\n\nHerbs, vegetables and bush tucker are affordable options in remote communities. (ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\n\"People are becoming healthier, they're losing weight, they're happier, their mental health has improved,\" Ms Caine said.\n\n\" People are starting to share what they grow in their gardens. Communities are coming together and they're starting to teach children and other people in the community. It's become a real community approach. \"\n\nMs Caine presented the model at the Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association's national conference in July, and believes it could be a blueprint for other communities across Australia.\n\n\"You could use this for any chronic disease or for health promotion to keep people well and educate people in holistic wellness before they become unwell,\" she said.\n\nFinal results from the pilot program are expected in November.",

(Supplied: District Council of Robe)\n\nDistrict Council of Robe chief executive Nat Traeger said the situation was not yet like the movie Caddyshack, in which a gopher messes with a greenskeeper by digging holes all over a golf course.\n\n\"It doesn't really look like it's going to pop out, but we did certainly have a chat with the bowling club just in case they were fearful that it might pop up under their bowling green and do damage there, but they're not too worried about it,\" she said.\n\n\" We certainly don't wish the little fella harm, but we certainly don't want to see it damage our infrastructure as well. \"\n\nWombats at the Robe Golf Club in March 2024 (left) and March 2021 (right).

(ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nChinese communities around Australia and the world mark the festival, but Christmas Island's event pays special homage to its distinct history.\n\nChris Su was born in Singapore amid ongoing medical restrictions that bar island births.\n\nBrought to Christmas Island as an infant, he has observed the ancient tradition all his life.\n\nChris Su has taken part in the ceremony since he was a child. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\n\"These [ghosts] are people who have died far from home,\" Mr Su says.\n\n\"They didn't get a proper burial, they didn't have any descendants to make them offerings\n\n\" We believe they are hungry, of sorts, in the afterworld. \"\n\nThe festivities are to appease the \"hungry ghosts\" on the island. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nOfferings in flames\n\nAbout 100 people meet at a small temple in Drumsite, near a dusty industrial area that still houses the remnants of an incline railway.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn the early 1900s, small hopper cars carried precious mounds of phosphate through the neighbourhood, moving steeply from jungle quarries to port.\n\nMr Su explains that the temple, tucked away on a now-suburban street, is dedicated to the deity Sheng Wong.\n\n\"He [Sheng Wong] and his two marshals on the left and right of him open the gates of the underworld and let the hungry ghosts pass through to walk the material world to take offerings,\" Mr Su said.\n\nHonouring Sheng Wong, deity of the underworld. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nThe former phosphate transport hub is a fitting place for the community to gather.\n\nThe precious mineral, often used in fertilisers, was in high demand in the 19th century, leading to the recruitment of hundreds of indentured workers, or \"coolies\", from China to Christmas Island.\n\nUnder the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, they were forced to dig four-to-seven tonnes per man each day, often with their bare hands.\n\nMoney and incense wrappers are offered to the island's \"hungry ghosts\". (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nIn 1901, an outbreak of beri-beri killed more than half the labourers, who subsisted almost entirely on white rice.\n\n\"Beri-beri \u2026 is a type of deficiency disease, not having enough nutrition, a very painful way to die,\" Mr Su says.\n\n\" It was very, very hard yards working for the British Empire back in the day and for a pittance. \"\n\nOfferings to the restless spirits go up in flames. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nWorshippers lay out tables of food and burn paper money in a large bonfire, with hopes the offerings will ease the ghosts' hunger.\n\nBut it is not just the \"coolies\" Christmas Island residents remember.\n\nFifteen children were among 50 Iraqi and Iranian asylum seekers who drowned off Christmas Island when their vessel crashed into its rocky cliffs in 2010.\n\nThe ceremony takes place in the seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams )\n\nIt was a brutal chapter for an island so closely associated with its immigration detention centre.\n\nThe controversial facility spent decades at the centre of Australia's boat turnbacks policy and was being briefly mothballed in 2018, before it was reopened for pandemic quarantine.\n\nIt remains in a limbo-like \"hot contingency\" state to this day.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2010 disaster, residents offered a paper boat (bottom), baby shoes, and formula for those who lost their lives. (Supplied: Chris Su)\n\n\"You will see baby formula and baby food and baby shoes at the offering ceremony sites, because baby spirits can't eat adult food,\" Mr Su says.\n\n\" We make formula; we offer it to them. \"\n\nCommunity around the table\n\nFoo Kee Heng, a community elder and committee president of the Drumsite temple, sits at a corner table as people shuffle through, lighting candles and offering prayers.\n\nFoo Kee Heng says offering the ghosts food and money will give people peace.

(ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nAttendees are invited to share in a traditional feast \u2014 no small feat on an island where a head of lettuce can cost upwards of $16.\n\nFood offerings are an important part of the ceremony for the \"hungry ghosts\". (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nPowerful superstitions\n\nDuring the month-long festival, Mr Su warns the scent of frangipanis should be avoided.\n\n\"If you're walking around at night time and you start to smell a very fragrant smell, especially franjipani, it means the spirits are near,\" he says.\n\n\" Avoid cutting your fingernails at night ... [and] don't hang out too close to banana trees. \"\n\nChinese temples are dotted throughout Christmas Island.

        "text": "Shawn Hinves and his family have created an idyllic life for themselves on their Kangaroo Island farm.\n\nFrom the verandah of their home, they can see their sheep, goats, cows and two pet kangaroos.\n\nKoalas lounge in the trees that they planted 20 years ago.\n\nBut at the heart of their existence is one fascinating insect, the Ligurian honey bee.\n\n\"It's sort of changed my whole life completely,\" Shawn Hinves, a former tyre fitter said.\n\n\"They've been recognised as the most pure strain of Ligurian bee left in the world.\n\n\"I have a great appreciation of what they are, what they do, and everything that they produce has a positive effect on the human body.\"\n\nKangaroo Island is home to purest strain of the Italian Ligurian bee. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nThe Ligurian bees were brought from Italy to the island, 13.5 kilometres off South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula, in 1884 and it was declared a sanctuary in 1885. It is said to be the oldest bee sanctuary in the world.\n\nThere are now five-to-six commercial beekeepers on the Island that have opened shops and tourism operations, running beekeeping tours and employing more than 50 locals. There are also up to 100 hobby apiarists who keep hives on the island too.\n\nBut their bees and the businesses they sustain are now facing perhaps their greatest threat as the Varroa destructor spreads quickly across Australia.\n\nThe island's industry is under threat from the deadly Varroa mite that arrived in Australia in 2022. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nThe deadly mite was first detected in the Port of Newcastle in NSW, in June 2022 and has since spread to Victoria, Queensland, ACT and two weeks ago, was found in South Australia for the first time.\n\nSouth Australian Apiarists Association president Brenton Davis said the mite would have a \"big impact\" and more needed be done to protect Kangaroo Island's bees.\n\n\"It's an internationally-significant population and very much needs to be protected,\" Mr Davis said.\n\n\"[Varroa] is one of the most significant pests the Australian beekeeping industry has ever seen, so it's going to have a big impact on the industry.\n\n\"We need to do everything we can to in order to stop the Varroa from getting to Kangaroo Island.\"\n\nMr Davis says more needs be done to protect Kangaroo Island's bees from Varroa mite. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)\n\nThe mite is about the size of sesame seed, but can wipe out hives with thousands of bees.\n\n\"It actually drills a hole into the bee and then lives on the bee's fat deposits,\" Mr Davis said.\n\n\"So, opening up the bees to the susceptibility to viruses it weakens them and it can actually kill out colonies quite quickly.\"\n\n'Ferocious' mite\n\nAttempts to eradicate the mite from Australia were abandoned in September 2023 with the national strategy now aimed at slowing the spread.\n\nBut that has proved difficult as bees are regularly transported across state borders to help pollinate different crops, including almonds. It was bees brought in from Queensland that led to the Varroa mite reaching SA's Riverland.\n\nThe former tyre-fitter turned beekeeper began as a hobbyist before his passion became his vocation. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nShawn Hinves said greater effort should have been taken to contain the Varroa mite.\n\n\"It's very frustrating \u2026 if the end game is just to get Australia infected and just deal with it that way, then that's just how they're gonna do it,\" Mr Hinves said.\n\n\"But if they're serious about biosecurity and protecting beekeepers, the food industry, and everything that wraps around it, then they need \u2026 to have more regulation, more rules, higher monitoring, but I just don't think that they're putting enough time, enough effort, enough staff into these big issues.\"\n\nLegislation in South Australia forbids people bringing a number of products to Kangaroo Island. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nBrian Morrison is a retired diver who lives in picturesque Emu Bay and is one of the island's enthusiastic hobby beekeepers.\n\n\"They are just a fascinating critter, and the more you learn, the more you find out you don't know anything about them,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\nMr Morrison, like most of the island's beekeepers, is worried that there are not enough biosecurity checks being put in place to protect the bees on the island.\n\n\"I am very, very concerned that we're it's not being taken seriously by the government,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\n\"The Varroa mite \u2026 that thing is ferocious and in \u2026 three-to-four years it will just completely wipe out a hive.\n\n\"We've got a unique opportunity to protect it, but they're going to have to start looking seriously at beefing up the biosecurity, something similar to the West Australian border, where every vehicle is stopped and searched.\n\nBrian Morrison is one of up to 100 hobby beekeepers who keep hives on Kangaroo Island. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\n\"At the moment, these guys at the biosecurity do a good job, but they basically just ask you, 'do you have honey?' So, if you're a dishonest person or you're having a problem with language, which we've found that people from overseas are bringing honey in and not realising because they didn't understand the biosecurity officer.\"\n\nFrontline checks\n\nPrimary Industry Minister Clare Scriven defended the South Australian Government's Varroa management strategy but said she did want to boost frontline services.\n\n\"No used bee equipment can go to the island, no honey products can go to the island, no hives can go to the island,\" Ms Scriven said.\n\n\"We have our checks at the ferry terminal.\n\n\"We're certainly happy to expand that if it is necessary and I've been speaking with my department today about the staffing levels that we have there and they're currently recruiting for extra staff.\"\n\nMany hives on the island are still recovering following bushfires in 2019/2020. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nThe threat of the Varroa mite comes as the island's honey production levels remain low.\n\nThe 2019/2020 Kangaroo Island bushfires wiped out many hives on the western end of the island and trees in the area are yet to start producing nectar that the bees collect for honey production.\n\nBev Nolan's family owns Clifford's Honey Farm, which has three generations working in the business, and employees 14 people.\n\n\"There's still a lot of areas that either got wiped out completely or are still in recovery mode,\" Ms Nolan said.\n\nBev Nolan says the Ligurian bees have been vital to Kangaroo Island's tourism industry. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nMs Nolan said her family had upgraded its shop and diversified products to keep it profitable.\n\n\"The Ligurian bees are a really big tourist story,\" Ms Nolan said.\n\n\"It's also \u2026 important for the world to have a honey bees that are nice and calm and hardworking and isolated from pests and diseases as well.\"\n\nBut as the threat continues to grow, some like Brian Morrison are considering their future in the industry if Varroa mite makes it onto the island.\n\nThe bees were brought to Kangaroo Island in 1884. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\n\"I'll probably end up getting out of beekeeping, I think that's what will happen,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\n\"I'll be devastated, and you know, maybe then I'll start looking and moving somewhere else \u2026 that's how I'm feeling already.\n\n\"This algal bloom [after the fires] has kind of been like the last straw.\n\n\"I do love it here and the people that live here are fantastic and we do have a good life, but [there] just seems to be one thing after the next at the moment.\"",

        "text": "The warning lights were flashing for giant childcare operator G8 Education.\n\nIt had an unorthodox $26 million deal on the line to sell centres to Genius Education, a venture whose subsequent collapse would strand staff and parents, and whose boss Darren Misquitta would later plead guilty to receiving suspected proceeds of crime unconnected to the child care industry.\n\nDespite G8 knowing about problems, an ABC investigation can reveal how the childcare giant downplayed concerns and maintained it had conducted checks.\n\nGold Coast-based G8 even passed on information packages detailing Genius's success to key stakeholders. It was replete with pictures of centres refurbished with sandpits, sunshades and climbing equipment, and glowing references from businessmen including Adrian \"Lambo Guy\" Portelli.\n\nThe deal's fallout was devastating.\n\nDarren Misquitta pleaded guilty last month to receiving $120,000 in suspected proceeds of crime unrelated to the childcare industry. (LinkedIn)\n\n\"Genius is like this thunderstorm that just came in and wiped us all out within months,\" said Samantha White, who resigned as assistant director at one Canberra centre.\n\n\" G8 is accountable for their actions and how this has affected thousands of children and hundreds of educators. \"\n\nG8 is Australia's biggest for-profit operator, running almost 400 centres under brands including Bambino's and Kindy Patch Kids. The ASX-listed company, valued at almost $600 million, is among big corporates in a sector that was, until the early 2000s, more a cottage industry.\n\nA hodgepodge amalgamation of childcare businesses, G8 owned 175 centres by 2012. Its annual report that year featured a giggling infant wearing thick black glasses, with the company crowing operations were going from \"strength to strength\". It kept growing.\n\nBut earnings see-sawed between losses of $189 million in 2020 to profits of $68 million in 2024. Investors savaged shares this year after a former staffer was charged with child abuse.\n\nIn 2023, G8 made a deal to offload 31 outlets to Genius. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nThe deal\n\nBack in October 2023, red ink oozed from some underperforming centres, so G8 fashioned an unorthodox solution: offload 31 outlets to another childcare operator, Genius.\n\nOddly, G8 would pay $26.5 million to Genius.\n\nThe logic, G8 said, was trading the centres through to lease end would be more expensive than handing cash to Genius, which would take on associated liabilities.\n\nBut the deal immediately raised industry hackles.\n\nThe director of Genius entities was Misquitta, now 41.\n\nHe boasted the trinkets of entrepreneurialism: the black t-shirt of new-wave chief executives and a trophy property \u2014 an acreage residence on Victoria's elite Mornington Peninsula. He had Deakin University law and commerce degrees, and a resume in banking, mining, education and private equity.\n\nGenius director Darren Misquitta looked the part of a modern millionaire. (Supplied)\n\nBut harsh headlines about Genius were published before the deal, involving landlords suing over unpaid rent. A key Misquitta family company that largely owned Genius also faced winding up applications.\n\nG8's new chief executive Pejman Okhovat, a retail industry veteran recruited from Big W, reassured stakeholders. He expressed confidence Genius would \"provide the ongoing high level of service that the children, families and our team at these centres expect and deserve\".\n\nG8's new chief executive Pejman Okhovat reassured stakeholders Genius would provide an ongoing high level of service. (Supplied)\n\nThat month, a Genius subsidiary for a Melbourne's Collins Street childcare centre, which boasted an in-house chef, was tipped into court-ordered liquidation, owing $5 million in a lease dispute. The liquidator complained Misquitta had not supplied financial records as required.\n\nMisquitta maintained he would work with the liquidator, and \"external noise\" would not disrupt the G8 deal.\n\nLandlords and Lambo guy\n\nG8 was in a bind. To offload centres, G8 needed to convince landlords to transfer leases to Genius. But some landlords were wary of Genius.\n\nThe ABC has seen information packs from Genius that G8 forwarded to landlords.\n\nThey included accounts, in which Misquitta was listed as sole director of companies, showing earnings within Genius entities.\n\nThere were also pretty photographs of refurbished centres; a once sad-looking centre with a faux grass play area, for instance, was transformed with a cute garden with a tree and water pump.\n\nPhotos showing the refurbishment of Genius centres were included in an information pack to G8 landlords. (Supplied)\n\nThe pitch was Genius could revive poorly performing centres.\n\nThe package also included letters of recommendation.\n\nOne was from Adrian Portelli, the controversial lottery businessman who in 2022 drove up in a yellow Lamborghini to bid $4.5 million on a home for TV show The Block.\n\nAdrian Portelli with a new Lamborghini. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nIn the letter, Mr Portelli wrote his business had already developed childcare centres and \"Genius has been an excellent tenant\".\n\nMr Portelli told the ABC the business had an agreement with Genius to lease centres but they ultimately were not tenanted.\n\n\"After that letter, [Misquitta's] and Genius' issues surfaced, so we terminated those agreements,\" he said. \"I did not have direct dealings with him.\"\n\nAdrian Portelli was among those who wrote a letter of recommendation for Genius. (ABC News: Lisa Batty)\n\nSome financial information also concerned landlords. A Genius group balance sheet, for instance, was bolstered by millions of dollars owed by other Misquitta-linked entities.\n\nLandlord Fiona O'Donnell and extended family had three childcare properties with G8 \u2014 they transferred one lease to Genius but withheld two more.\n\n\"We were not comfortable about the standing of Genius,\" she told the ABC. \"The financial information provided appeared to be smoke and mirrors.\"\n\nThe pledge\n\nThe 26-storey Brisbane offices of law firm Allens is the opposite of a childcare centre \u2014 the windows reveal a spectacular CBD view, but the meeting room itself is sterile.\n\nIt was May 2024, and G8 was holding its annual shareholder meeting. Mr Okhovat, the chief executive \u2014 who at centres can wear a company-labelled polo shirt \u2014 was dressed in a businessman's tan suit.\n\nG8 admitted the Genius deal was stumbling. Only 17 centres had transferred to Genius \u2014 landlords were edgy and regulatory approvals taking time.\n\nMr Okhovat told media that G8 was \"well aware\" of landlord lawsuits entangling Genius, and Genius had provided appropriate evidence \"for us to go ahead\".\n\nPejman Okhovat told media that G8 was \"well aware\" of landlord lawsuits entangling Genius. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nGiven children were involved, did G8 have a responsibility to ensure centres going to Genius would be open for the long-term?\n\n\"Very clearly and very concisely: Yes, absolutely,\" he replied. \"We exercise our due diligence at the highest level.\"\n\nThat included to ensure \"Genius's financial position was at the right level\".\n\nThree weeks later, the United Workers Union published a letter, complaining Genius was not paying staff wages on time. A landlord also claimed Genius defaulted on rent after acquiring one ACT centre in February 2024. The landlord evicted Genius within a year.\n\nIt goes to questions including whether G8 was blindsided \u2014 or simply did not care if centres floundered once off its books.\n\nOne source who has worked with Mr Okhovat regarded him as a straight-dealing businessman, who would have been working to secure a deal genuinely assisting stakeholders. G8 also maintained to the ABC it always intended for \"a continuity of care and employment for families and team\" in the Genius deal.\n\nThe opposite happened.\n\nThe takeover tragedy\n\nMs White's G8 facility in Gowrie, on Canberra's southside, was originally called the Blinky Bill early childhood centre, after the cute koala book character.\n\nIt was a well-performing centre, Ms White said, and staff fretted after hearing of Genius services potentially lacking resources and wages were not being paid elsewhere.\n\nSamantha White resigned from her role after the Genius takeover. (Supplied)\n\nWorried staff even stocked up on extra supplies such as nappies while G8 remained owner.\n\nAfter the transfer, wages were late on the first payday. Then long-planned fixes, such as of fencing and sandpits, also stopped, she said.\n\nMs White fumes at reassurances G8 provided about Genius.\n\n\"It was all lies. You know, we had a full team here at the service and you know, we had beautiful families,\" she said.\n\nEighteen centres ultimately were signed over; Genius shut 12 between August 2024 and March this year. The Gowrie centre is one of five still trading under administrators WLP Restructuring.\n\nEighteen centres were signed over and Genius shut 12 between August 2024 and March this year. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nThe administrators' initial investigations are damning. WLP wrote the Genius subsidiary that acquired the G8 centres may have been insolvent upon commencing trading.\n\n\"The director [Misquitta], through related companies, continued to withdraw funds from [that subsidiary and another running centres] resulting in insufficient funds being available to meet the payment of employee wages and statutory liabilities,\" they wrote.\n\nAdministrators also uncovered concerns about accounts for the other subsidiary, alleging amendments were made transforming a balance sheet from an insolvent position of $40 million to a positive $50 million.\n\n\"We do not consider that the financial accounts provide an accurate reflection of the true nature of the transactions,\" they wrote.\n\nIt's not clear which Genius company received G8's cash (at least one entity is not in administration). G8's accounts indicate up to $10 million went to Genius.\n\nBreak-ups and bankrupts\n\nMisquitta is bankrupt and his marriage has broken down, a court heard. The Mornington estate is gone, seized and sold by lenders.\n\nHe pleaded guilty last month to receiving $120,000 in suspected proceeds of crime in 2019, drawn from a business loan from a venture not associated with the childcare deal. Attempts to obtain comment from him were unsuccessful.\n\nG8's chief executive Mr Okhovat, whose take home pay last year was $1.5 million, declined to comment to the ABC.\n\n\"If you have any more questions you can send them via email,\" he said briefly. \"Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye.\"\n\nG8 acknowledged people \"may be impacted\" by Genius's takeover. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nG8 emailed anodyne statements that did not answer questions, but argued regulators and landlords had consented to Genius deals.\n\nIt acknowledged people \"may be impacted\" by Genius's takeover.\n\n\"However, as G8 Education no longer owns or operates these centres, questions regarding their operation following the change of ownership should be addressed to Genius,\" it said.\n\nMs O'Donnell, the landlord, also owns G8 shares and questions checks done on Genius.\n\n\"The CEO should be accountable for the due diligence performed and explain how the obvious was missed,\" she said. \"The staff, families and children were treated so poorly.\"",

        "text": "Marinakis, who is from Piraeus, on the edge of Athens, and long married with four children, is the founder and chairman of international shipping company Capital Maritime & Trading Corp, having taken over his father\u2019s fleet of seven tankers and grown it into some 120 vessels. In 2018 he merged his fleet with that of Donald Trump\u2019s former commerce secretary Wilbur Ross (Diamond S Shipping), which he later labelled his \u201cworst business decision\u201d. In 2017, he was named Greek Shipping Personality of the Year by British publication Lloyd\u2019s List. Last year, he received an honorary doctorate from the renowned US-based Massachusetts Maritime Academy. He has also been at the forefront of reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the shipping industry, as part of an alliance that founded the Maritime Emissions Reduction Centre (MERC) in Greece. Ange Postecoglou with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis in July. Marinakis the media mogul owns two of Greece\u2019s most influential daily newspapers, Ta Nea and To Vima, and in 2019 launched a Greek television channel, One Channel. His company, Alter Ego Media, is the largest media organisation in Greece. A little-referenced detail is that he has also dabbled in songwriting and wrote lyrics for Greek pop artist Natasa Theodoridou\u2019s smash hit Excitement (Exapsi), which reportedly had 1 million YouTube views within the first six days of its release in 2021. Marinakis\u2019 foray into football started in 2010, when he bought his hometown team Olympiakos and became president. The club has since won 11 domestic league titles and the 2023-24 Europa Conference League.\n\nHe became the majority shareholder of Forest in 2017 when the two-time European Cup winners (1979, 1980) had been struggling in the second-tier English Championship for almost two decades and narrowly avoided relegation to League One. He pledged to restore the club to its glory days and, under his stewardship and Steve Cooper\u2019s management, they earned promotion to the Premier League in 2022 \u2013 for the first time since 1999. In 2023, he also acquired Portuguese club Rio Ave. These investments have cemented Marinakis as one of Greece\u2019s most powerful figures, to the point where he was called an oligarch by Greece\u2019s former prime minister and opposition leader Alexis Tsipras. It was not meant as a compliment. This is where the controversial headlines begin.\n\nThe most enduring was a years-long investigation by the Greek state into allegations Marinakis was involved in trafficking the largest amount of heroin ever seized in Europe. The bust involved two tonnes of the stuff with a street value of more than \u20ac400 million ($705 million), smuggled into Piraeus aboard a small tanker called Noor One and hidden in warehouses and private homes. The case triggered a war of retribution that has left at least 17 people dead on three continents, and phone records exposed scores of police who the smugglers bought off, from Turkey to the United Arab Emirates. Marinakis was embroiled in 2018, charged with financing and storing drug substances and setting up a criminal group to traffic and sell drugs. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the country\u2019s leftist-led government of plotting against him, which his newspapers described as \u201ca game of many years\u201d. The case was closed in 2021 due to a lack of evidence. Evangelos Marinakis, pictured at a home game at the City Ground last year, has his eye on everything at his football clubs. Credit: Getty Images At the time those charges were laid, Marinakis had just been cleared of his second set of match-fixing charges. The first related to the Koriopolis scandal \u2013 irregular betting patterns mostly involving Greek Cup and second-tier games in 2009 and 2010 \u2013 and he was acquitted in 2015. The second came in 2017, when he was one of 28 Greek football figures due to face trial as part of the country\u2019s 2015 match-fixing scandal, in which players, referees, club executives and the football federation were accused of fraud, blackmail and forming a match-fixing ring. Eventually most charges were dropped, and courts acquitted all 28 defendants. He was accused of being involved in the 2012 bombing of a referee\u2019s bakery, which occurred days after Olympiakos suffered a 1-0 defeat to Xanthi. The bakery\u2019s owner, Petros Konstantineas, was that game\u2019s referee and claimed he had been pressured before kick-off to ensure Olympiakos \u201cdefinitely\u201d won. Again Marinakis denied any wrongdoing, and again all charges were dropped.\n\nHe is, right now, being investigated in relation to civil misdemeanours, prompted by the death of a riot police officer who was injured by a flare following an Olympiakos v Panathinaikos volleyball game in December 2023. Allegations once more denied, this time with a claim of a blackmail attempt. Marinakis has taken his fight against the \u201csmear campaign\u201d all the way to the High Court in London, suing Irini Karipidis (chair of Greek club Aris Thessaloniki) and Ari Harow (formerly the chief of staff to Israeli prime minister Netanyahu) for allegedly waging a six-month campaign of \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d claims. They include linking him to heroin smuggling and match fixing, and also being head of a criminal organisation known as The System. The libel case was filed late last year; in January, a judge ruled it can continue. Nonetheless, the strenuous denial has been a semi-regular fixture in the repertoire of a man who gets about Greece with black-clad bodyguards but is also known for extensive philanthropic efforts. Marinakis is a former city councillor for Piraeus and still carries out mayor-like duties, personally funding projects such as building playgrounds and soup kitchens. His personal website is replete with stories about his charity work: everything from providing refugee children from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq with meals, clothing and toys, to inviting Shakhtar Donetsk to play a \u201cStop War\u201d fundraising friendly against Olympiakos in their first match since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In 2018, he donated \u20ac1 million to the emergency effort after wildfires killed 103 people and devastated the Attica coastline, and in 2017 coordinated the relief efforts when flash floods hit Mandra, killing 25 people.\n\nThe juxtaposition is weird to reconcile, but then much about him is unorthodox. He reportedly likes the colour red. He does not like the colour green (Panathinaikos\u2019 colour). Or purple (bad luck). Or black (unknown). He has a tattoo on his arm that reads: \u201cDream, Love, Create, Fight, Survive, Win.\u201d He takes defeat as a personal insult and will threaten \u2013 and sometimes take \u2013 action. Even if it is the start of the season, as Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo learnt this past week. He churns through players and managers at a rate ruthless even to rivals in the notoriously fickle Premier League. So far at Olympiakos he has employed 17 managers. At Forest, Postecoglou will be his eighth. Marinakis celebrates with Olympiakos after winning the 2024 UEFA Europa Conference League final. Credit: Getty Images He likes \u2013 needs \u2013 to control the narrative. Apparently he even put out feelers to add some British media to his portfolio, offers that were declined. He keeps his cards close to his chest and values privacy. But he can also be volatile in public.\n\nIn 2011, after the full-time whistle in a Olympiakos-Panathinaikos derby (\u201cthe derby of the Eternal Enemies\u201d), Marinakis had an on-field row with opposition striker Djibril Cisse that sparked a lawsuit and counter-suit for slander, verbal abuse and threats, and then libel (guess which was which). In 2024, he was banned for five Premier League matches for spitting towards match officials after a 1-0 home loss to Fulham during which the visitors were awarded a penalty on VAR advice but denied Forest two penalty appeals. Marinakis argued he was merely disposing of phlegm, caused by his cigar habit, and the incident was unintentional. \u201cHe cannot now remember if any spittle left his mouth but if it did (and he does not challenge that some might well have done) it certainly was not aimed at the referee\u2019s feet and did not hit anybody,\u201d his witness statement read. The English Football Association rejected the defence as \u201ccompletely implausible\u201d based on statements and CCTV footage, and condemned the action as \u201can egregious display of disrespectful behaviour\u201d. In May he banned Gary Neville from the City Ground and told Jamie Carragher to \u201cf--- off\u201d for backing his Sky Sports colleague.\n\nAnd, of course, he had stormed onto the pitch to confront the highly respected Nuno after a draw with Leicester City guaranteed the club would compete in Europe for the first time in three decades and took their Champions League hopes out of their hands. Neville called the move \u201cscandalous\u201d in a post on X, which might have had something to do with being denied access to the stadium as a co-commentator later that month. Other observers just couldn\u2019t believe a shipping magnate with a net worth of about $US5.1 billion went in for the kill holding a long-discontinued iPhone 7, complete with wired EarPods. Loading Such public temperamentality is, based on the public record, matched behind the scenes. The Forest boardroom has, at times, been in a state of civil war. The rift with Nuno really ramped up with the July appointment of Edu, Arsenal\u2019s former sporting director, as Forest\u2019s new global head of football. The Brazilian is now one part of an informal triumvirate alongside Marinakis and super-agent Kia Joorabchian, whose extensive portfolio includes Edu. Joorabchian, who runs Amo Racing, has co-invested in a racehorse with Marinakis and appears to have his paws all over his friend\u2019s stable of football clubs. Marinakis, for his part, is said to be so hands-on his staff feel micromanaged. \u201cMarinakis runs that club with the same obsessive influence as a chap who runs a corner shop,\u201d Mail sport football editor Ian Ladyman told the Whistleblowers podcast this week.",

Credit: Getty Images \u201cThat\u2019s my job to try and embed that over the next few weeks and I\u2019m sure we will because there is a willing group of players to do that. You will see a difference at Swansea on Wednesday night.\u201d Postecoglou did spot some positives, especially with the performance of \u201cbrilliant\u201d midfielder Elliot Anderson. The England international was clearly on a wave of confidence after two impressive displays under Thomas Tuchel in the World Cup qualifiers, and was Forest\u2019s stand-out performer. High-pressing was clearly the order for Postecoglou\u2019s new players, but Forest were forced to defend so deep for much of the afternoon that they could barely venture out of their own half. Inspired by the brilliance of new signings Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze, plus midfielder Martin Zubimendi, Arsenal were irresistible at times. Madueke, in particular, was outstanding and it feels like a trick of the imagination that some Arsenal supporters seemed so averse to his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nArsenal will begin their latest Champions League journey this week away against Athletic Bilbao and this was a delicious response to the defeat at Liverpool before the international break. Arteta clearly has more strength in depth than before, and do not overestimate the presence of a specialist centre-forward in Viktor Gyokeres. Martin Zubimendi of Arsenal scores his team\u2019s first goal past Matz Sels of Nottingham Forest. Credit: Getty Images The only disappointment was a recurrence of Martin Odegaard\u2019s shoulder injury, with the captain joining a casualty list that includes Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz and William Saliba. Forest did cope well for half an hour, despite being penned back, but from the moment Zubimendi broke their resistance it was game over.\n\nTime on the training ground over the next few weeks will be precious for Postecoglou. Loading It was Arsenal\u2019s players who took centre-stage, and Zubimendi provided a moment of magic which enabled them to break down their opponents. Chris Wood\u2019s header from a Madueke corner arced into the path of the Spanish midfielder outside the penalty area and he crashed a dipping volley past Matz Sels. Zubimendi\u2019s first Arsenal goal was a masterclass in technique, albeit taking a deflection off Forest centre-back Murillo.\n\nWithout key defender Ola Aina until the end of the year with a hamstring injury sustained on international duty this week, Murillo was withdrawn soon after the goal in clear discomfort. Arsenal required only 46 seconds of the second-half to extend their lead with a goal of brutal simplicity. Eze and Gyokeres combined with the Swede providing the finish, following a lofted pass over the top from Riccardo Calafiori. Postecoglou stood with his arms folded, shaking his head. As Arsenal threatened to overrun his new team, the inevitable chants of \u201csacked in the morning\u201d echoed around the Emirates. Zubimendi added the third goal 11 minutes from the end with a header from substitute Leandro Trossard\u2019s cross and, in the end, it could have been even worse.\n\nWelcome back, Ange. Meantime, Newcastle United\u2019s new signing Nick Woltemade enjoyed a dream debut, scoring in their 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers for their first victory of their campaign, while Bournemouth continued their strong start with a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, Tottenham Hotspur cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United, and a late Brentford goal denied Chelsea moving atop the table. Fulham recorded their first win of the season by beating Leeds United 1-0 thanks to a late own goal, while Crystal Palace were held to a 0-0 draw by Sunderland and neither Everton nor Aston Villa could find the back of the net in a scoreless draw. Villa have failed to score in their opening four league games of a season for the first time in their history.\n\nChelsea looked poised to leapfrog Arsenal to the top of the table after Cole Palmer scored an equaliser in his return from a groin injury to cancel Kevin Schade\u2019s first-half goal, and Moises Caicedo celebrated what he thought was the winner in the 85th minute. But Fabio Carvalho poked home the equaliser from six yards out in the 93rd after Schade\u2019s long throw-in. \u201cDelighted with the approach of the group, the character we constantly show,\u201d Brentford boss Keith Andrews told the BBC. Micky van de Ven of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates scoring. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe equaliser came very late but it\u2019s what I felt we deserved from the game in terms of the application, the quality the players showed for large parts.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s new club record signing Woltemade stole the show in Tyneside in their first game since their former hero Alexander Isak departed for Liverpool, scoring in the 29th minute when he arrived at the back post to send a header past Sam Johnstone. \u201cThe fact we haven\u2019t won a game puts more pressure on you in the latter stages,\u201d Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told the BBC. \u201cThe win was all that mattered but we\u2019d love to win in a better style and score more goals. \u201cIt was great to see Nick score on his debut. Very strong, I was very pleased with him.\u201d\n\nTottenham left West Ham languishing in the bottom three, with the Hammers suffering another blow as midfielder Tomas Soucek was sent off for a dangerous tackle. Pape Matar Sarr, Lucas Bergvall and Micky van de Ven all scored second-half goals in Spurs\u2019 first game since executive chairman Daniel Levy\u2019s exit from Tottenham. \u201cSo happy that the goal came in the second half because you never know, the momentum can change after half-time but we kept going and scored a good goal after and then 3-0 done,\u201d Spurs boss Thomas Frank said. \u201cSo a very good clear win, a good performance and I think we all know the derby and the importance of the game for the fans.\u201d\n\nAt Bournemouth, Alex Scott opened scoring with a brilliant strike from outside the box in the 18th minute. Brighton drew level in the 48th on a goal from Kaoru Mitoma but Antoine Semenyo sealed the victory for Bournemouth\u2019s third win on the bounce with a penalty in the 61st after Evanilson was brought down. \u201cThe mood in the camp is perfect. We can\u2019t ask for any more, we just have to keep going,\u201d Semenyo told the BBC. Fulham appeared headed for another draw when Gudmundsson scored a horror own goal from a corner kick in the 94th minute, stooping to head in the ball with great force. Loading",

        "text": "Australian sprinter Torrie Lewis has made light of a stacked field and a headwind to smash her own national 100m record and storm into the semi-finals on day one of the world athletics championships in Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\nLining up against defending world champion Sha'Carri Richardson from the US, two-time world 200m champ Shericka Jackson from Jamaica and two other runners with career sub-11 second PBs, Lewis could well have been overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead she was inspired.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 20-year-old flew out of the blocks on Saturday and held her form in the closing stages to clock 11.08 seconds into a 0.8m per second headwind.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe finished a close third behind Richardson (11.03) and Jackson (11.04), with only the top three in each heat guaranteed to advance.\n\n\n\nLewis stripped two-hundredths of a second from her previous national record of 11.10 set last year in Canberra, with the promise of even better to come in Sunday's semi-finals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was super nervous before this competition because I knew in training that these are the times I can hit,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Actually this is the slowest time in my mind that I had, so hopefully I can build on that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis was proud of how she handled the cards she was dealt in the heats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was like 'thanks guys for giving me the hardest one',\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"But after I let it sink in I was very glad I had them because I can run with them, and who cares if they beat me, because they're the best in the world ever, almost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I just wanted to run as fast as I could with them and see how I go.\"\n\n\n\nJessica Hull wins 1500m heat\n\nLooking every inch the runner who claimed a historic silver at last year's Paris Olympics, Jessica Hull was a commanding winner of the first of three women's 1500m heats.\n\n\n\n\n\nHull sat near the front for the duration of the race and covered all moves in the final straight to win in 4:04.40.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe will be joined in Sunday's semi-finals by compatriot Linden Hall, who was fourth in her heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nHull showed no after-effects from her shocking defeat at the recent Diamond League final in Zurich when she ran out of gas and was pipped on the line by Kenyan Nelly Chepchirchir.\n\n\n\nJessica Hull kept a close eye on the chasing pack as she won her 1500m heat at the world titles. Source: AP / Matthias Schrader \"It's hard when it's the first race after something like that so I definitely was a little bit more intuitive in my body,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to feel what I was feeling and just trust it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had the gears I thought I would have when I was fully tapered and fresh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch every session of the 2025 World Athletics Championships live and free across SBS VICELAND, including the World Athletics Championships 2025 Hub via SBS On Demand.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am my phone a lot, like way too much. But the people who use their phone - while they are on the toilet - that is disgusting. And I am one of those people (audience laughter). Sometimes I go to the bathroom and I sit down and I'm like: oh man, I forgot my phone. And I sit there all bored. I wonder what my phone is doing?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's US stand-up comedian Anjelah Johnson-Reyes on Tik Tok, confessing about her phone use while on the toilet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's not only a phone full of germs you should be worried about.\n\n\n\n\n\nSitting on the toilet for too long and scrolling through your social media accounts or clearing out your emails can increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Rupert Leong is a gastroenterologist based at Concord Hospital in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The theory is that the pathogenesis (way the condition develops) of this vascular swelling is due to straining. So people that sit on toilets especially those that sit on for extensive periods of time and may not be focused on just defecating. They are distracted doing other things whilst defecating i.e. on smartphones. This activity may be prolonging the defecation process, resulting in excessive straining, which can then increase the pressure of the blood vessels that lead to the vascular swelling; and eventually rupture of the vessels that lead to bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHaemorrhoids is one of the most common anorectal health conditions in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlinders University Emeritus Professor Graeme Young is a gastroenterologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are number of clear signs of a haemorrhoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Haemorrhoids are in the beginning internal and small. It's only in the modern day TV and news that we would be discussing this sort of detail isn't it? It's only when they start to bulge down a bit through the anus that they become apparent and you can feel uncomfortable in that area. And usually when you're wiping yourself after passing a bowel action you will feel something is not right. You'll even feel haemorrhoids and if they get really big and bulge well yes they're big and bulging and they feel like a couple of grapes in there. You will know if you've got haemorrhoids either because of the physical presence or the suggestion they are there because of the bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA new US study published in peer-reviewed PLOS ONE journal surveyed 125 adults, aged 45 and older, who were having a colonoscopy at a hospital in Boston (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe were asked how often they used their phones while on the toilet - and for how long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found 66 per cent of all participants used smartphones while on the toilet, with that group spending more time - over five minutes - on the toilet than non-phone toilet users.\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking the news and using social media were the most common smartphone toilet activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers suggest that smartphone use may inadvertently prolong toilet time, potentially increasing pressure in anal tissues, which may then lead to haemorrhoids.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Young says the focus should be on being efficient and strain-free in your bowel movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For people who have a difficult bowel habit in terms of initiating the bowel action, the chances are they are going to be sitting longer on the toilet and straining. What It really boils down to is it's not a good idea to be sitting on the toilet for ages; waiting and hoping for something to happen, and especially straining to achieve that. If you go to the toilet and nothing is happening fairly quickly, you really need to get up and leave it; and come back to it later on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pain and inflammation from haemorrhoids can often be easily treated with over-the-counter medications from the pharmacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more severe cases, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess often, a surgical procedure might be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with time spent on the toilet, other commonly believed haemorrhoid risk factors, include: low fibre intake, straining, constipation, age, sex differences and pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there is a real problem of constipation - and by constipation we mean not going to the toilet often enough - then you really need to get the constipation dealt with by dietary fibre; and discussion with the doctor if that doesn't work. So I'm not sure that it's to do with reading the phones (scrolling on the phone). I think people are reading the phones cause they're sitting there waiting for something to happen and what are they going to do? So it's an interesting study, but I think it's more about sitting on the toilet for too long than it is about scrolling down the phone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are haemorrhoids diagnosed?\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say you should firstly visit your general practitioner who will ask you about your symptoms and will examine your anal passage to look for any swollen blood vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Leong says the GP visit could also be useful in ruling out more serious conditions, including bowel cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The symptoms of haemorrhoids is non-specific so passage of red blood can be something as benign as a haemorrhoid or it can be something more sinister that includes bowel cancer. So anyone who has got bleeding in the bowel should present to the general practitioner who would perform an external examination. Just by looking can help to confirm haemorrhoids however somebody who has not had sufficient investigations they should have a colonoscopy. So I'm talking about someone who hasn't had a colonoscopy before or now getting in the age group where bowel cancer can be common. Then they should present to a gastroenterologist who can then perform a colonoscopy which is a fixable telescope that goes up the rectum into the bowel to have a good view on the inside. I think that's the true way to exclude something sinister.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Kate MacKrill is gastroenterology psychologist at Middlemore Hospital, and a lecturer at the University of Auckland.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told the Australian Science Media Centre that smartphone use on the toilet might be disrupting gut-brain communication.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the human digestive system is controlled by what's called the enteric nervous system - a neural network within the gastrointestinal tract, which is often described as the body\u2019s second brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr MacKrill says sitting on the toilet for longer than you need to might start to change the signals the bowel sends, making the bowel unsure whether it has completely evacuated, leading to abdominal pain, actual constipation, discomfort, and an even longer time sitting on the toilet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Coalition needs to learn some hard lessons from a fortnight dominated by fallout after Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price falsely claimed Labor was prioritising the intake of Indian migrants to boost its vote, experts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice has since been demoted from the frontbench and Opposition leader Sussan Ley has apologised on behalf of the Liberal Party \"to all Indian Australians and indeed others who were hurt and distressed by the comments\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, despite calls from some Indian Australian figures for a direct apology from Price, that has not been forthcoming. She has, however, said her comments were \"clumsy\" and that she \"never intended to be disparaging towards our Indian community\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal senator Jane Hume said there had been \"mishandling on all sides\" and hoped the Coalition would learn from its \"entirely unedifying week\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The good news is, we have cauterised the wound,\" she told Seven's Sunrise on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"We are going to move on now and talk about what's important to ordinary Australians,\" Hume said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what are the lessons the Coalition should take from this \"unedifying\" episode, and how should they better connect to \"ordinary Australians\"?\n\n\n\n'Acting like a bunch of babies'\n\nRedbridge director of strategy and analytics Kos Samaras said the imbroglio showed the Coalition still hadn't learned important lessons from the last two elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former Labor Party strategist said that, while it's true that Indian Australians do skew towards supporting Labor, the Coalition needed to take a far more constructive approach to dealing with its lack of popularity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the Labor Party, when we were presented with stats about how Labor was struggling with particular constituencies, we did not reject them \u2026 we did not demonise the community that was attached to them. We tried to find out ways to fix that problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, instead of acting like a bunch of babies at a creche, perhaps they need to be professional about their profession and work out ways to fix this.\"\n\n\n\nRedbridge's research showed two-party-preferred support for Labor among Indian Australians in the 2025 election was in the \"mid-60s\", Samaras said recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, new polling from Roy Morgan suggests that, among Indian-born Australians, 45 per cent back the ALP, compared to 39 per cent support for the Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamaras said the effect of Price's comments could be comparable to former prime minister Scott Morrison's \"ham-fisted approach\" to the Australian Chinese community, which resulted in many voters from that community turning away from the Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 48 per cent of Chinese-born Australians now support Labor, while only 34 per cent favour the Coalition, the recent Roy Morgan poll suggested.\n\n\n\n'They don't like us'\n\nWhile many Chinese and Indian Australians had socially conservative values that the Coalition should be able to appeal to, Samaras said, this opportunity had been squandered by a perceived antipathy towards these groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we interview Indian Australians in particular \u2026 they have socially conservative views on a whole range of issues. We say: 'Well then, why aren't you voting for the Liberal Party?' Their answer is: 'They don't like us'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said to avoid continuing electoral erosion, the Coalition needs to \"embrace the reasons why diverse Australians come to this country in the first place\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that is to start a family, be prosperous and enjoy a peaceful life. They need to understand that that's why most new Australians arrive here, looking for that life, looking for that prosperity,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSuccessful political leaders in Australia understand that elections in Australia are won from the centre, Samaras said, warning that Price's comments seemed to be imported \"from an environment which is all about mobilising and energising your base\".\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting United States-style culture war issues into a country with compulsory voting was bound to fail, Samaras said, \"because you have to actually find out ways to connect with the disengaged, the undecided\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice's suggestion that Labor was prioritising groups of migrants who were inclined to politically support them echoes an accusation commonly made by conservative Americans against the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\n'A cautionary tale to get the house in order'\n\nContinuing fracture in the Coalition will also be poorly received by voters, Zareh Ghazaria, a political scientist in the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things that we've seen in Australian politics is that once voters get a sense that a political party is divided over policy, over personnel, then they tend to turn away from that party,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria, where the Coalition has been out of power for over 10 years, provided federal conservatives with \"a cautionary tale to get the house in order\", he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[The Victorian Coalition] has been rife with internal instability, a party that has had debates about its personnel and policy settings, and voters have responded accordingly by not voting for them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhile the Liberal Party has always had ideological divisions, Ghazaria said, \"the trick has been for successful leaders to somehow accommodate both strands\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The current situation and the current tension between the more progressive and more conservative Liberals has really been amplified by the fact that it suffered such a heavy loss at the last election,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Coalition's disastrous 2025 federal election result, many Coalition figures pushed for a change of direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutgoing veteran senator Simon Birmingham called for \"a reshaping of the party to connect it with the modern Australian community\" and explicitly criticised \"judgemental attitudes that exclude or isolate some\".\n\n\n\nOpposition immigration spokesperson Paul Scarr told The Guardian it was a \"profound tragedy\" that Chinese, Indian and other diaspora communities had turned away from the Liberal Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a television interview this week, he again emphasised the importance of ensuring that debate about immigration \"doesn't become a debate about any particular part of the Australian community\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we're talking about these issues, we're talking about failures of government policy.\"\n\n\n\nA 'contest for what the party stands for'\n\nGhazarian also said if the Coalition wanted to have a debate about immigration, it should be \"a debate that focuses on the government's performance\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we've seen hints of it, where it's been linked to economic prosperity and service delivery,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That provides the Opposition with a platform to demand more from the government to increase investment in infrastructure, to demand investment in service delivery, to demand investment in schools, education, hospitals, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That plays to the Liberal Party's strengths, you'd think, in that it focuses on economic management.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think migration was a huge turning point for this election or the previous election. The election was very much focused on cost of living and economic policy,\" he added.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Accusing others of a woke agenda, Peter Dutton became a victim of his own culture war\n\nThe recent controversy showed the Liberal Party was still in the midst of a \"real contest for what the party stands for,\" Ghazarian added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is the party wanting to potentially portray itself as being a broad party that can represent the interest of all sorts of views in the community, or is it going to seek to pursue much more narrower policy focus, which looks at things like immigration, things like cultural identity, and so on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince demoting Price, Ley has said the Coalition would remodel its policy development processes to seek input from a wider range of voices.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told The Australian that the Coalition's policy development process would \"evolve throughout the term in response to internal and external feedback, emerging issues, and ongoing engagement with the community\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Samaras believes the Coalition won't find it easy to shift towards a more centrist policy platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the grip that right-wing echo chambers have on the Coalition's membership is strong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think the Coalition's membership is going to continuously animate their MPs and make it very difficult for the parliamentary wings to completely detach from a form of politics that clearly is not popular in this country.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Regional security and climate change loomed as major themes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese embarked on a colourful and at times chaotic visit through Vanuatu and Solomon Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centrepiece was the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders' meeting in Honiara. The summit's communique will outline the key outcomes of the forum\u2019s discussions but is yet to be released.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while Albanese has been keen to highlight a blossoming relationship with the Pacific family, not all has gone to plan.\n\n\n\nA Vanuatu eruption\n\nThe first stop on Albanese's Pacific trip was Vanuatu, where it was widely expected a long-awaited $500 million pact would be signed with leader Jotham Napat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nakamal Agreement, which would have seen Australia provide an additional $50 million in aid per year to the nation for the next decade, was meant to have been finalised and settled well before the prime minister boarded his RAAF jet.\n\n\n\nIt was widely expected that Australia would sign a long-awaited $500 million pact with Vanuatu leader Jotham Napat (centre) at the Pacific Islands Forum. Source: AFP / Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Last month, Australian ministers trekked to the summit of an active volcano with their Vanuatu counterparts to mark the \"finalisation\" of the deal \u2014 a stratospheric spectacle to celebrate the end of negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the smoke rising in the background was an omen, because in the days before this visit, it became clear support within Vanuatu's coalition government was far from solidified, and on Tuesday before leaving, Albanese admitted on breakfast radio the deal was unlikely to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Friday's joint press conference in Port Vila, instead of a signing, Napat revealed the reason for the collapse in support: fears the pact's wording would limit Vanuatu's ability to sign infrastructure deals with partners like China.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacific analyst Tess Newton Cain said: \"Their [Vanuatu's] main driver is to ensure that they have available to them the resources that they need to guarantee human security in Vanuatu.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means working with a wide range of partners.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nakamal Agreement was to replace a previous security deal Vanuatu never formally ratified over concerns the terms agreed with Australia would impinge on its status as a non-aligned nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese remains optimistic the agreement can be resurrected, and after sipping some cava with Napat to the tunes of King Stingray's live vocals, gave his counterpart a lift to Honiara the following morning.\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong was pressed about whether Vanuatu's ties to China were cause for concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told the Today Show: \"You might be able to speak for Vanuatu, I don't choose to,\" before a fire alarm rang out in her office, forcing the interview to be abandoned as \"evacuate now\" warnings drowned out her words. Auspicious timing indeed.\n\n\n\n4WD diplomacy\n\nSolomon Islands' hosting of the PIF in the bustling, muggy capital of Honiara has further fuelled the contest for influence in the Pacific region.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd among the new displays of calculated charity from international partners were rival fleets of vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia promised a fleet, including Ford Rangers and Toyota Hiluxes, to be liveried in the colours of Solomon Islands police, but it was China's high-end Great Wall Motor SUVs that would ferry the leaders from venue to venue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duelling announcements, made within hours of each other, dominated Australian coverage in the lead-up to the event, with stories of Pacific power plays retopped with an angle reflecting the Antipodean fondness for four-wheel drives.\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands' hosting of the Pacific Islands Forum in the bustling capital of Honiara has further fuelled the contest for influence in the Pacific region. Source: AAP / Poppy Johnston And so considerable eyebrows were raised when Albanese stepped off the plane on the Honiara tarmac and hopped into an awaiting Chinese-supplied vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he was disappointed not to be picked up by an Australian-supplied Hilux, Albanese responded glibly: \"It's a car. You know, cars get you from A to B.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Honiara, international aid partners have plastered their logos on various projects, ranging from billboards to bus stops.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Australia has long been the largest partner for development, China has its own expensive contributions, including the national stadium, which hosted the PIF opening ceremony and the media centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele addressed the increased strategic interest in the region directly in his opening address to the summit.\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele did not invite PIF partner nations, including China, the US and Taiwan, to this year's meeting. Source: AAP / Ben McKay \"The world around us is changing fast, competition from powerful interests is intensifying,\" Manele said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Pacific must never be seen as an arena for others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nManale opted not to invite PIF partner nations, including China, the US, and Taiwan, to this summit in an attempt to avoid those tensions that could upend the forum's agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose partners have, on the whole, respected the decision, and the move was criticised by Australia as well as independent Solomon Islands MP Peter Kenilorea Jr.\n\n\n\nA long-time China sceptic, he views infrastructure as \"front line\" of the strategic contest across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While Australia has been very helpful throughout our history \u2026 in perhaps a softer policy support capacity, I think the infrastructure space is where the real issues are now decided,\" he said.\n\n\n\n'Big dog' Australia's climate record questioned\n\nWhen leaders attend these summits, weeks of preparation go into planning the schedule, keeping up with customs, and drafting announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut often things don't stick to the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday's program witnessed several changes, delaying the sign-off on the Pacific Resilience Facility \u2014 a fund to help the region cover the costs of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelegates wept as the ceremony started \u2014 acknowledging the existential threat that this will go some way to addressing, and years of frustration over struggles to gain international support for mitigation and recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia contributed an opening $100 million, but Albanese initially made a striking impression when he entered.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the dapper blue dress of other leaders, he was adorned in a pink-patterned shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few minutes the wardrobe malfunction was identified and while speeches were still ongoing, Albanese, in full view of the cameras, walked out of the room for a frantic shirt change before walking back in a matching garb.\n\n\n\nThe pink shirt was never seen again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wardrobe malfunction greatly amused New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, teasing Albanese the following morning about wearing the right shirt to the family photo.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked by New Zealand media if the faux pas was a sign of Australia \"being the big dog and thinking they can wing it\", Luxon drily replied: \"I think he just forgot the instructions to be honest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got to reiterate quite a lot to the Australians what they need to be doing in the rules sometimes,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Albanese often speaks fondly about the closeness of the government to the \"Pacific family\", a coordination cock-up at a major climate event only served to highlight some of the dissonance felt by other nations around Australia's track record on emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the region is on board with a bid for a Pacific COP Climate Summit, Vanuatu's climate minister Ralph Regenvanu said Australia would need to match its climate ambitions in line with its island neighbours if it were to be a good host, as a decision on 2035 climate targets fast approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also want Australia to start to talk seriously about addressing its fossil fuel production pipeline,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenvanu argues the July International Court of Justice ruling finding nations have a legal obligation to prevent climate impacts means Australia's view that it can meet its Paris commitments by completing a domestic transition, while still exporting fossil fuels like coal and gas, is \"now untenable\".\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Albanese maintained gas is an important part of the transition and the domestic economy, while also talking up his government's climate record, describing the region's support for the COP bid as a show of trust in Australia's \"leadership\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAn impasse over the hosting rights remains \u2014 with T\u00fcrkiye also jostling for the event, with the hope a resolution can be worked out with President Recep Tayip Erdo\u011fan on the sidelines at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau will host next year's PIF before COP31, and President Surangel Whipps Jr said it would be \"an act of good faith if others would clear the way\" to allow the Pacific a global climate platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The coming weeks are make or break, which is why we agreed to work very closely with Prime Minister Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't want this major international opportunity to pass us by.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Legendary sports commentator Bruce McAvaney says \"it's no illusion\" that Australian athletics is at the beginning of a \"golden age\" of development and success in the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking ahead of his role commentating SBS' coverage of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, McAvaney said he believes Australian athletics is in the best shape it's ever been, with several serious medal contenders among the country's 80-odd member team.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney said the event, running from 13-21 September and broadcast on SBS, is potentially the third most significant global sporting event behind the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, with athletes from 198 countries participating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t get bigger than this,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A diverse group of Australians from all sorts of backgrounds, come together \u2026 with 197 other countries. There are very few global opportunities like this.\"\n\n\n\nMcAvaney says Australian athletics competitors have been building impressive momentum that he believes will lead to victories in this year's championships and continue through to the Brisbane Olympics in 2032.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we\u2019re at the beginning of a golden age, and at the Brisbane Olympics, in seven years time, that\u2019s not going to go away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And this really all began in Tokyo four years ago, where you could see the writing on the wall so I believe this group are representing a team that is in a period the whole country is going to be very excited right now and going forward.\"\n\n\n\nAustralian runner Jessica Hull won the silver medal in the Women's 1500m final at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Source: AAP / Dean Lewins At the Paris Olympics in 2024, Australia's athletics team won seven medals, the most at an Olympic Games since 1956, and the year before won six at the World Championships, also a record high.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney says momentum on and off-track makes him believe in the emergence of a golden age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s not manufactured, it\u2019s very real, it\u2019s not an illusion what\u2019s happening out there in terms of the depth of talent in our country\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOff the track he says Australia is being considered a more serious player in global athletics, with events like the Sydney marathon gaining a huge global following as one of five major marathons.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, two major medal hopes have become late scratchings \u2014 Olympic pole vault champion Nina Kennedy and racewalker Jemima Montag, who won bronze in the 20km in Paris, have pulled out of the championships through injury, threatening Australia's overall medal tally hopes.\n\n\n\nPressure on young stars\n\nNearly a quarter of Australia's team are 21 or younger, another reason why McAvaney predicts they will shine at a home Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest-profile young Australian athlete is undoubtedly Gout Gout, who at just 17-years-old and running 100 metres in under 10 seconds, is being compared to sprinting great Usain Bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the Australian teenager while in Tokyo for the competition, Bolt said even though Gout is talented, it's never going to be \"just easy\" for him to win.\n\n\n\n\"He's very talented, with the times he's running now and he's really been doing well,\" Bolt said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's something that you love to see because you want athletes to do well. The more athletes do well, the bigger the sport is, and I'm always a supporter of track and field getting bigger and doing bigger things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if he continues on this track he's going to be good, but it's all about getting everything right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGout will compete in the men's 200m heats on Wednesday 17 September.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney said Gout is \"so interesting\" given he's about to start his year 12 studies while dealing with global fame and pressure to perform.\n\n\n\nBruce McAvaney hugs Gout Gout as he celebrates winning his Under 20s 200m final at the Queensland Athletics Championships in Brisbane in March. It was the first time Gout had run below 20 seconds for the 200m.

I think he will run particularly well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAvaney said he thinks middle-distance runner Peter Bol is another athlete who could perform well, given he's running faster now than he was when he placed 4th in the 800m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe master commentator flagged distance runner Jess Hull and discus star Matt Denny as other standouts, as well as high jumper Nicola Olyslagers, who won silver in Paris, as Australia's best medal hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She\u2019s the Diamond League champion and the world indoor champ, at the moment I think it\u2019s a 50-50 bet between her and [Ukrainian Olympic champion Yaroslava] Mahuchikh, she\u2019ll be on the podium and she\u2019s a great competitor,\" McAvaney said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to watch 2025 World Athletics Championships LIVE on SBS\n\nThe 'one lap' that inspired the whole world\n\nThis year marks the 25-year anniversary of the Sydney Olympic Games \u2014 and for many Australians, Cathy Freeman's gold medal win in the 400 metres is among their favourite sporting memories of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked about role models in athletics, McAvaney said the Indigenous runner is one of the greats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Cathy\u2019s legacy is even stronger right now than it was 25 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s how pure and rich that whole performance was from the lighting of the cauldron to winning that gold medal.

        "text": "\"Are we good enough?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis question has stayed with Felicity Button since the day she discovered $11,571 had been withdrawn from her bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 2017, and Button had just taken her baby daughter to a doctor's appointment. She says she had recently been paid, and knew she could afford the appointment, medication and petrol to return home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went to go and pay for my appointment, and my card declined,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nButton contacted Centrelink and found out that a debt collector had withdrawn the money, claiming she owed a historical robodebt.\n\n\n\nFelicity Button (pictured) was one of the lead applicants in the robodebt class action and appears in SBS's docu-drama The People vs Robodebt. Source: SBS News / Simon Morris Several years prior, Button had received income support from Centrelink \u2014 Youth Allowance and Austudy \u2014 while studying for her nursing degree and working several jobs. However, that support ended in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recalls receiving a letter in September 2016, alleging she owed a debt, which she subsequently queried with Centrelink. She says the service \"couldn't really give [her] any answers\". After nearly a year of correspondence, she was moved onto a payment plan of $20 per week. Then the money was unexpectedly withdrawn from her account in September 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile driving home, she recalls feeling powerless and saying: \"I may as well run my car off the road.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, the debt recovery scheme set up by the then Coalition government relied on an automated assessment of tax office and welfare payment data to calculate average earnings and issue debt notices to welfare recipients. The process often failed to accurately reflect earnings, with many recipients pursued for debts they did not owe, including Button.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme raised $1.76 billion from around 526,000 recipients through approximately 794,000 debt recovery transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA royal commission into the scheme, which ran between 2022 and 2023, described robodebt as a \"crude and cruel mechanism\" that was \"neither fair nor legal\" and \"made many people feel like criminals\".\n\n\n\n\"In essence, people were traumatised on the off-chance they might owe money. It was a costly failure of public administration, in both human and economic terms,\" the commission wrote in its final report in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictims suffered severe impacts from being falsely accused of owing debts, the report found. In some circumstances, the despair robodebt caused led to recipients taking their own lives .\n\n\n\n\n\nButton, now a mother of two, appears in SBS' upcoming docu-drama series The People vs Robodebt. She has been one of the lead applicants in a years-long class action lawsuit brought against the federal government over the botched debt recovery scheme, including a landmark appeal settled last week . Her money was returned; however, the ordeal has had a lasting impact.\n\n\n\n\"I think mothers inherently always question ourselves on whether or not we're doing a good enough job \u2026 and are we good enough? That's unfortunately ingrained in being a woman and a mother, for the most part,\" Button says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But this brings it to a much deeper level \u2026 It makes you think, all it takes is one thing to completely derail your life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's one of many robodebt victims who have fought for compensation and are now seeking accountability.\n\n\n\n'Financial vindication' or 'accountability avoided'?\n\nButton first joined the legal fight against robodebt in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched by Gordon Legal, the initial class action was settled in 2020, with the federal government agreeing to repay wrongfully raised debts and accrued interest \u2014 amounting to a settlement of $1.8 billion. (The majority of this cleared the $1.76 billion in unlawful deductions).\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, it announced that an appeal led by the firm had been settled for a further $548.5 million , including $475 million in compensation for victims.\n\n\n\nGordon Legal says the appeal was launched following the release of the royal commission's report in 2023, which uncovered new evidence of misfeasance \u2014 the wrongful use of legal authority \u2014 by senior public servants who designed and ran the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appeal argued that the new evidence should be considered to allow victims to seek further compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The allegations were that very senior public servants knew that the scheme they were implementing was unlawful,\" Gordon Legal partner Andrew Grech says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we were able to establish that in court, as we believed we would be able to \u2026 that would have meant group members who suffered distress or further financial loss, or in some tragic cases, had loved ones who took their own lives, would have been able to seek financial damages compensation for the distress that they suffered,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThat was very significant because many group members felt the original class action didn't really answer some of those questions, and didn't make the public servants involved truly accountable for what had occurred.\n\nGrech hopes victims feel a \"sense of finality\" and that their concerns \"have been listened to\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland said the settlement shows the Albanese government's \"ongoing commitment to addressing the harms caused to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Australians by the former Liberal government's disastrous robodebt scheme\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Settling this claim is the just and fair thing to do,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreement includes up to $60 million in administration costs and up to $13.5 million to cover the applicants' legal costs, with the remaining $475 million for compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf approved by the Federal Court, the government said this would be the largest class action settlement in Australian history. According to Gordon Legal, it would deliver more than $2.4 billion in financial redress for victims.\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland said settling the claim is the \"just and fair thing to do\". Source: AAP / Lukas Coch For Button, the settlement brought some relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It] was really reflective of the financial penalty that the government has to now pay for such an egregious act, which is sad, because we're looking at it from a financial penalty point of view \u2026 but there's no compensation to the families that lost people,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can give them all the money in the world; it's not going to bring the person back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie welcomed the settlement but said it does not \"deliver full justice\" for victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ten years on from when robodebt commenced, no-one responsible for its design, implementation and continuation has been publicly held accountable in a way that delivers justice for its victims and their families,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie said the settlement does not \"deliver full justice\" for robodebt victims. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Christopher Rudge is a lecturer at Sydney Law School, researching welfare law. Beyond the settlement being \"a day of financial vindication\" for victims, he also believes it's \"a day of accountability avoided for those who designed the scheme\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This isn't just a payout; it's the price the government was willing to pay to avoid a public trial based on the royal commission's evidence of misfeasance in public office,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe settlement ensures the central legal claim of the litigants will never be tested in court.\n\nWhile the Commonwealth may have been able to successfully defend the claim, Rudge argues: \"We still would have been able to better scrutinise the standards we expect of public servants in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGrech says that in any litigation process, \"the answers are never complete\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we think we've been able to do is to shine a light on what was unlawful conduct and to ensure that people harmed by it get some sense of closure and some redress for the harm that was caused to them,\" he says.\n\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIt could take up to six months for the Federal Court to approve the settlement, Grech says. A minimum of $475 million would then be available to distribute among members who choose to participate; however, the specifics of how that will be allocated to individuals have yet to be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith up to 471,000 members in total, Grech expects there to be tens of thousands of people who would opt to receive a fixed payment or individualised assessment. To put that in perspective: if 471,000 registered, the average compensation amount for each person would be $1,008.\n\n\n\n\n\nRudge says the settlement's billing as the largest of its kind in Australia is \"a reflection of the size of the cohort rather than the generosity of the payments to victims\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an investigation into six referrals from the royal commission is being led by the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), based on an announcement made by an independent decision maker for the NACC in February. The referrals were contained in a sealed chapter, recommending individuals for civil action or criminal prosecution.\n\n\n\nThis reversed an earlier decision by the NACC not to commence a corruption investigation against the six individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If any of those six referred individuals committed a breach of public trust, then we should expect that private hearings will be held \u2014 or could have already been held \u2014 and we await any findings emanating from those hearings,\" Rudge says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The powers of the NACC are primarily referral-based. It doesn't have the power to prosecute, lay charges or convict in its own right.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Button is relieved with the class action win, she wants to see individuals held to account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want to see criminal charges laid on the people that orchestrated, designed and constructed the scheme,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I want to see further mental health support for people who lost more than money can recoup.\n\n\n\nAnother scheme: Addressing a historical debt calculation\n\nRobodebt is not the only instance of unlawful debt calculations by government agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 27 August, the government announced it would be rolling out \"resolution payments\" for those potentially impacted by a historical debt calculation method known as income apportionment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice was used by Centrelink between 1991 and 2020 to calculate debts for recipients where it was unclear when income was earned. It involved averaging income evenly across two or more fortnightly payment blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Ombudsman found the method was unlawful in 2023, but said this arose from agencies \"genuinely holding an incorrect understanding\" of the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government estimates that around 5.5 million debts \u2014 previously or currently held by around three million people and worth around $4.4 billion \u2014 may be affected. The vast majority have already been repaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bill introduced to parliament seeks to address income apportionment by validating its use for past calculations, and setting up a resolution scheme for those with potentially affected debts.\n\n\n\nSocial Services Minister Tanya Plibersek introduced a bill to Parliament on 4 September, seeking to address income apportionment by validating its use for past calculations and establishing a resolution scheme for those with potentially affected debts. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch This follows the Federal Court's approval of a method for the government to recalculate debts owed in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, the government instead said, rather than go back and recalculate all these unlawful debts, we will put forward legislation that validates those past unlawfully calculated debts, and we will pay a $600 resolution payment to anyone identified as affected,\" Rudge says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the bill to parliament on 4 September, Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek said reopening debts and recalculating them \"would cause distress and protracted uncertainty for the people affected\", and divert critical government resources away from frontline services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was not robodebt,\" she stressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRudge says the government has been clear in distinguishing income apportionment from robodebt. However, while they are distinct methods of calculating debts, he argues there is overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A single debt could be affected by both,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAutomatic cancellation of job seeker payments 'unlawful'\n\nMeanwhile, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been investigating the cancellation of job seeker payments by a government department under an automated system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) was set up in 2018 to ensure job seekers complete specific activities, called mutual obligation requirements, in order to continue receiving payments. This process is managed by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and Services Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew laws were introduced in April 2022 that required consideration of a job seeker's circumstances before deciding to cancel a payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the ombudsman found 964 people had their income support automatically cancelled between April 2022 and last July, when the DEWR secretary paused cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A further 45 job seekers received automated cancellations after the secretary's decision to pause cancellations, when they should not have,\" ombudsman Iain Anderson said in a report, published on 6 August.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Ombudsman scolds government agencies over automatic cancellation of welfare payments SBS News 01:30 English\n\nThe ombudsman said agencies' cancellation of income support was not lawful and did not ensure processes and computer systems were complying with amended legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited conclusions from the robodebt royal commission about the use of automated processes, and the \"serious impact\" these can have on vulnerable people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report recommended the department not resume cancellations until errors are rectified and cancellations are compliant with the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparately, the government commissioned an independent assurance review into the IT system that underpins the framework. Undertaken by Deloitte and released on 14 August, it found a \"critical lack of traceability\" linking legislation, operational policy and \"automatic compliance logic\" embedded within the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a DEWR spokesperson confirmed it has accepted all recommendations from the ombudsman's report, noting it and Deloitte's review made \"a number of important findings and recommendations, including areas for urgent action and longer-term improvements\".\n\n\n\nThe department is taking immediate steps to address the urgent actions identified.\n\nThe spokesperson confirmed all payment reductions and cancellations remain paused.\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review also reported that the Deloitte report includes a number of fabricated references, including to academic works. Rudge, who discovered the errors, suspects these were generated by artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DEWR spokesperson said Deloitte has confirmed some footnotes and references in its final report were incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The department has requested that Deloitte provide a corrected version of the statement of assurance and final report as soon as possible,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News understands Deloitte is managing the matter.\n\n\n\nIn Rudge's view, the TCF has a \"broad policy commonality\" with other scandals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a framework designed to ensure that welfare recipients are never permitted to receive an entitlement that is in any way suspected of being an overpayment,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When a policy initiative is pursued relentlessly, internal decision-making becomes siloed and overly goal-oriented, and decisions are made in an unexamined way that is contrary to law. That is what has happened here, just as in the other schemes, although in a very different way.\"\n\n\n\nCould robodebt happen again?\n\nRudge points to a growing risk of technological error, particularly with the rise of AI interacting with complex legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think all of the variables combine to become the ingredients of another scandal,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we're not careful and if there isn't a paradigm shift \u2026 we could see it [robodebt] happening again.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the regional mums taking on the government's automated debt recovery scheme\n\nRudge argues a change in policy approach is needed, one that focuses on the entitlement of welfare recipients to support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The principle should be that rather than assume there is fraud in every area of the system, it should be the working assumption that people are entitled to the welfare that they are receiving, and there should be a much higher threshold for investigating fraud,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nButton hopes the robodebt settlement is a \"wake-up call to the government to say 'we're not going to tolerate this'\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says her fight was never about the money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More importantly, the future looks a bit brighter for my kids.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three episodes of The People vs Robodebt will premiere on 24 September on SBS on Demand. Episodes will air weekly on SBS.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Marinakis, who is from Piraeus, on the edge of Athens, and long married with four children, is the founder and chairman of international shipping company Capital Maritime & Trading Corp, having taken over his father\u2019s fleet of seven tankers and grown it into some 120 vessels. In 2018 he merged his fleet with that of Donald Trump\u2019s former commerce secretary Wilbur Ross (Diamond S Shipping), which he later labelled his \u201cworst business decision\u201d. In 2017, he was named Greek Shipping Personality of the Year by British publication Lloyd\u2019s List. Last year, he received an honorary doctorate from the renowned US-based Massachusetts Maritime Academy. He has also been at the forefront of reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the shipping industry, as part of an alliance that founded the Maritime Emissions Reduction Centre (MERC) in Greece. Ange Postecoglou with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis in July. Marinakis the media mogul owns two of Greece\u2019s most influential daily newspapers, Ta Nea and To Vima, and in 2019 launched a Greek television channel, One Channel. His company, Alter Ego Media, is the largest media organisation in Greece. A little-referenced detail is that he has also dabbled in songwriting and wrote lyrics for Greek pop artist Natasa Theodoridou\u2019s smash hit Excitement (Exapsi), which reportedly had 1 million YouTube views within the first six days of its release in 2021. Marinakis\u2019 foray into football started in 2010, when he bought his hometown team Olympiakos and became president. The club has since won 11 domestic league titles and the 2023-24 Europa Conference League.\n\nHe became the majority shareholder of Forest in 2017 when the two-time European Cup winners (1979, 1980) had been struggling in the second-tier English Championship for almost two decades and narrowly avoided relegation to League One. He pledged to restore the club to its glory days and, under his stewardship and Steve Cooper\u2019s management, they earned promotion to the Premier League in 2022 \u2013 for the first time since 1999. In 2023, he also acquired Portuguese club Rio Ave. These investments have cemented Marinakis as one of Greece\u2019s most powerful figures, to the point where he was called an oligarch by Greece\u2019s former prime minister and opposition leader Alexis Tsipras. It was not meant as a compliment. This is where the controversial headlines begin.\n\nThe most enduring was a years-long investigation by the Greek state into allegations Marinakis was involved in trafficking the largest amount of heroin ever seized in Europe. The bust involved two tonnes of the stuff with a street value of more than \u20ac400 million ($705 million), smuggled into Piraeus aboard a small tanker called Noor One and hidden in warehouses and private homes. The case triggered a war of retribution that has left at least 17 people dead on three continents, and phone records exposed scores of police who the smugglers bought off, from Turkey to the United Arab Emirates. Marinakis was embroiled in 2018, charged with financing and storing drug substances and setting up a criminal group to traffic and sell drugs. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the country\u2019s leftist-led government of plotting against him, which his newspapers described as \u201ca game of many years\u201d. The case was closed in 2021 due to a lack of evidence. Evangelos Marinakis, pictured at a home game at the City Ground last year, has his eye on everything at his football clubs. Credit: Getty Images At the time those charges were laid, Marinakis had just been cleared of his second set of match-fixing charges. The first related to the Koriopolis scandal \u2013 irregular betting patterns mostly involving Greek Cup and second-tier games in 2009 and 2010 \u2013 and he was acquitted in 2015. The second came in 2017, when he was one of 28 Greek football figures due to face trial as part of the country\u2019s 2015 match-fixing scandal, in which players, referees, club executives and the football federation were accused of fraud, blackmail and forming a match-fixing ring. Eventually most charges were dropped, and courts acquitted all 28 defendants. He was accused of being involved in the 2012 bombing of a referee\u2019s bakery, which occurred days after Olympiakos suffered a 1-0 defeat to Xanthi. The bakery\u2019s owner, Petros Konstantineas, was that game\u2019s referee and claimed he had been pressured before kick-off to ensure Olympiakos \u201cdefinitely\u201d won. Again Marinakis denied any wrongdoing, and again all charges were dropped.\n\nHe is, right now, being investigated in relation to civil misdemeanours, prompted by the death of a riot police officer who was injured by a flare following an Olympiakos v Panathinaikos volleyball game in December 2023. Allegations once more denied, this time with a claim of a blackmail attempt. Marinakis has taken his fight against the \u201csmear campaign\u201d all the way to the High Court in London, suing Irini Karipidis (chair of Greek club Aris Thessaloniki) and Ari Harow (formerly the chief of staff to Israeli prime minister Netanyahu) for allegedly waging a six-month campaign of \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d claims. They include linking him to heroin smuggling and match fixing, and also being head of a criminal organisation known as The System. The libel case was filed late last year; in January, a judge ruled it can continue. Nonetheless, the strenuous denial has been a semi-regular fixture in the repertoire of a man who gets about Greece with black-clad bodyguards but is also known for extensive philanthropic efforts. Marinakis is a former city councillor for Piraeus and still carries out mayor-like duties, personally funding projects such as building playgrounds and soup kitchens. His personal website is replete with stories about his charity work: everything from providing refugee children from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq with meals, clothing and toys, to inviting Shakhtar Donetsk to play a \u201cStop War\u201d fundraising friendly against Olympiakos in their first match since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In 2018, he donated \u20ac1 million to the emergency effort after wildfires killed 103 people and devastated the Attica coastline, and in 2017 coordinated the relief efforts when flash floods hit Mandra, killing 25 people.\n\nThe juxtaposition is weird to reconcile, but then much about him is unorthodox. He reportedly likes the colour red. He does not like the colour green (Panathinaikos\u2019 colour). Or purple (bad luck). Or black (unknown). He has a tattoo on his arm that reads: \u201cDream, Love, Create, Fight, Survive, Win.\u201d He takes defeat as a personal insult and will threaten \u2013 and sometimes take \u2013 action. Even if it is the start of the season, as Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo learnt this past week. He churns through players and managers at a rate ruthless even to rivals in the notoriously fickle Premier League. So far at Olympiakos he has employed 17 managers. At Forest, Postecoglou will be his eighth. Marinakis celebrates with Olympiakos after winning the 2024 UEFA Europa Conference League final. Credit: Getty Images He likes \u2013 needs \u2013 to control the narrative. Apparently he even put out feelers to add some British media to his portfolio, offers that were declined. He keeps his cards close to his chest and values privacy. But he can also be volatile in public.\n\nIn 2011, after the full-time whistle in a Olympiakos-Panathinaikos derby (\u201cthe derby of the Eternal Enemies\u201d), Marinakis had an on-field row with opposition striker Djibril Cisse that sparked a lawsuit and counter-suit for slander, verbal abuse and threats, and then libel (guess which was which). In 2024, he was banned for five Premier League matches for spitting towards match officials after a 1-0 home loss to Fulham during which the visitors were awarded a penalty on VAR advice but denied Forest two penalty appeals. Marinakis argued he was merely disposing of phlegm, caused by his cigar habit, and the incident was unintentional. \u201cHe cannot now remember if any spittle left his mouth but if it did (and he does not challenge that some might well have done) it certainly was not aimed at the referee\u2019s feet and did not hit anybody,\u201d his witness statement read. The English Football Association rejected the defence as \u201ccompletely implausible\u201d based on statements and CCTV footage, and condemned the action as \u201can egregious display of disrespectful behaviour\u201d. In May he banned Gary Neville from the City Ground and told Jamie Carragher to \u201cf--- off\u201d for backing his Sky Sports colleague.\n\nAnd, of course, he had stormed onto the pitch to confront the highly respected Nuno after a draw with Leicester City guaranteed the club would compete in Europe for the first time in three decades and took their Champions League hopes out of their hands. Neville called the move \u201cscandalous\u201d in a post on X, which might have had something to do with being denied access to the stadium as a co-commentator later that month. Other observers just couldn\u2019t believe a shipping magnate with a net worth of about $US5.1 billion went in for the kill holding a long-discontinued iPhone 7, complete with wired EarPods. Loading Such public temperamentality is, based on the public record, matched behind the scenes. The Forest boardroom has, at times, been in a state of civil war. The rift with Nuno really ramped up with the July appointment of Edu, Arsenal\u2019s former sporting director, as Forest\u2019s new global head of football. The Brazilian is now one part of an informal triumvirate alongside Marinakis and super-agent Kia Joorabchian, whose extensive portfolio includes Edu. Joorabchian, who runs Amo Racing, has co-invested in a racehorse with Marinakis and appears to have his paws all over his friend\u2019s stable of football clubs. Marinakis, for his part, is said to be so hands-on his staff feel micromanaged. \u201cMarinakis runs that club with the same obsessive influence as a chap who runs a corner shop,\u201d Mail sport football editor Ian Ladyman told the Whistleblowers podcast this week.",

The England international was clearly on a wave of confidence after two impressive displays under Thomas Tuchel in the World Cup qualifiers, and was Forest\u2019s stand-out performer. High-pressing was clearly the order for Postecoglou\u2019s new players, but Forest were forced to defend so deep for much of the afternoon that they could barely venture out of their own half. Inspired by the brilliance of new signings Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze, plus midfielder Martin Zubimendi, Arsenal were irresistible at times. Madueke, in particular, was outstanding and it feels like a trick of the imagination that some Arsenal supporters seemed so averse to his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nArsenal will begin their latest Champions League journey this week away against Athletic Bilbao and this was a delicious response to the defeat at Liverpool before the international break. Arteta clearly has more strength in depth than before, and do not overestimate the presence of a specialist centre-forward in Viktor Gyokeres. Martin Zubimendi of Arsenal scores his team\u2019s first goal past Matz Sels of Nottingham Forest. Credit: Getty Images The only disappointment was a recurrence of Martin Odegaard\u2019s shoulder injury, with the captain joining a casualty list that includes Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz and William Saliba. Forest did cope well for half an hour, despite being penned back, but from the moment Zubimendi broke their resistance it was game over.\n\nTime on the training ground over the next few weeks will be precious for Postecoglou. Loading It was Arsenal\u2019s players who took centre-stage, and Zubimendi provided a moment of magic which enabled them to break down their opponents. Chris Wood\u2019s header from a Madueke corner arced into the path of the Spanish midfielder outside the penalty area and he crashed a dipping volley past Matz Sels. Zubimendi\u2019s first Arsenal goal was a masterclass in technique, albeit taking a deflection off Forest centre-back Murillo.\n\nWithout key defender Ola Aina until the end of the year with a hamstring injury sustained on international duty this week, Murillo was withdrawn soon after the goal in clear discomfort. Arsenal required only 46 seconds of the second-half to extend their lead with a goal of brutal simplicity. Eze and Gyokeres combined with the Swede providing the finish, following a lofted pass over the top from Riccardo Calafiori. Postecoglou stood with his arms folded, shaking his head. As Arsenal threatened to overrun his new team, the inevitable chants of \u201csacked in the morning\u201d echoed around the Emirates. Zubimendi added the third goal 11 minutes from the end with a header from substitute Leandro Trossard\u2019s cross and, in the end, it could have been even worse.\n\nWelcome back, Ange. Meantime, Newcastle United\u2019s new signing Nick Woltemade enjoyed a dream debut, scoring in their 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers for their first victory of their campaign, while Bournemouth continued their strong start with a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, Tottenham Hotspur cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United, and a late Brentford goal denied Chelsea moving atop the table. Fulham recorded their first win of the season by beating Leeds United 1-0 thanks to a late own goal, while Crystal Palace were held to a 0-0 draw by Sunderland and neither Everton nor Aston Villa could find the back of the net in a scoreless draw. Villa have failed to score in their opening four league games of a season for the first time in their history.\n\nChelsea looked poised to leapfrog Arsenal to the top of the table after Cole Palmer scored an equaliser in his return from a groin injury to cancel Kevin Schade\u2019s first-half goal, and Moises Caicedo celebrated what he thought was the winner in the 85th minute. But Fabio Carvalho poked home the equaliser from six yards out in the 93rd after Schade\u2019s long throw-in. \u201cDelighted with the approach of the group, the character we constantly show,\u201d Brentford boss Keith Andrews told the BBC. Micky van de Ven of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates scoring. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe equaliser came very late but it\u2019s what I felt we deserved from the game in terms of the application, the quality the players showed for large parts.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s new club record signing Woltemade stole the show in Tyneside in their first game since their former hero Alexander Isak departed for Liverpool, scoring in the 29th minute when he arrived at the back post to send a header past Sam Johnstone. \u201cThe fact we haven\u2019t won a game puts more pressure on you in the latter stages,\u201d Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told the BBC. \u201cThe win was all that mattered but we\u2019d love to win in a better style and score more goals. \u201cIt was great to see Nick score on his debut. Very strong, I was very pleased with him.\u201d\n\nTottenham left West Ham languishing in the bottom three, with the Hammers suffering another blow as midfielder Tomas Soucek was sent off for a dangerous tackle. Pape Matar Sarr, Lucas Bergvall and Micky van de Ven all scored second-half goals in Spurs\u2019 first game since executive chairman Daniel Levy\u2019s exit from Tottenham. \u201cSo happy that the goal came in the second half because you never know, the momentum can change after half-time but we kept going and scored a good goal after and then 3-0 done,\u201d Spurs boss Thomas Frank said. \u201cSo a very good clear win, a good performance and I think we all know the derby and the importance of the game for the fans.\u201d\n\nAt Bournemouth, Alex Scott opened scoring with a brilliant strike from outside the box in the 18th minute. Brighton drew level in the 48th on a goal from Kaoru Mitoma but Antoine Semenyo sealed the victory for Bournemouth\u2019s third win on the bounce with a penalty in the 61st after Evanilson was brought down. \u201cThe mood in the camp is perfect. We can\u2019t ask for any more, we just have to keep going,\u201d Semenyo told the BBC. Fulham appeared headed for another draw when Gudmundsson scored a horror own goal from a corner kick in the 94th minute, stooping to head in the ball with great force. Loading",

        "text": "A $12 billion funding pledge aimed at boosting Australia's naval capabilities is part of the \"biggest peacetime increase\" in defence spending, the government says.\n\nThe money will be funnelled into constructing docks and shipbuilding facilities for the AUKUS submarines in Western Australia.\n\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration reviews the trilateral security deal with Australia, UK and the US and puts pressure on its allies to boost defence spending.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is due to fly to the United States next week for the United Nations General Assembly, where a face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump may be on the agenda.\n\nAnthony Albanese and Defence Minister Richard Marles will invest heavily in WA's Defence precinct. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe $12 billion will go towards the delivery of a Defence precinct within the maritime hub on Cockburn Sound in Perth's south.\n\nThe design of the Henderson facility will aim to deliver continuous shipbuilding and reinforce Australia's AUKUS capacity.\n\nAustralia's defence spending is presently sitting at two per cent of gross domestic product and the US has been pushing the nation to bump it to 3.5 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles said the government was focused on the \"dollar amount\" rather than the \"range of different measures\" for accounting for spending as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe government has pledged funds for docks and shipbuilding facilities in WA. (Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"When you include what we are spending here, it is the better part, relative to what we inherited when we came to government back in 2022, of an additional $70 billion of defence spending over the decade,\" he told ABC Insiders program on Sunday.\n\n\"And what that represents is the biggest peacetime increase in our defence spending in Australia's history.\"\n\nThe prime minister is set to confirm the mammoth investment along Mr Marles, Defence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh and WA Premier Roger Cook on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Marles refused to pre-empt the review outcome of the AUKUS review, but was confident the security deal was viewed favourably in the US.\n\n\"In all the conversations that I've had, there has been an enormous sense of positivity about the role that AUKUS can play for the United States.\"\n\nThe upgraded Defence facilities will support Australia's planned Virginia-class submarines.
