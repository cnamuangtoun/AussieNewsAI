        "text": "A majority of Australians are living in houses too big for them, new data reveals.\n\nUp to 60 per cent of Aussies either live on their own or with just one other person, but the bulk of houses in Australia have three bedrooms or more, a study from Cotality shows.\n\nThe reasons for Aussies wanting larger homes include the desire to have a home office as work from home rises, as well as having a spare bedroom for visitors.\n\nDespite most housing having three bedrooms or more, it is clear most households have no more than two people in them. (Supplied/Cotality)\n\nHouses have also become larger over time; as the urban sprawl pushes new developments further away from urban centres, homeowners prioritise features such as home gyms and home theatres.\n\nHowever, it could cause inefficiencies in how housing is allocated across the country, exacerbating the housing crisis that has gripped Australia.\n\n\"When most Australians picture the 'Great Australian Dream', they see a family with kids in a three or four-bedroom house. But data shows that dream does not match reality,\" Eliza Owen from Cotality said.\n\n\"Couples without children and people living alone make up the majority of households, raising questions about how well our housing market is serving real demand.\"\n\nREAD MORE: NATO warplanes scrambled amid Russian drone attacks on Ukraine\n\n(A Current Affair)\n\nOne-bedroom and studio homes make up just six per cent of Australia's current housing stock.\n\nDespite this, there is some change beginning to be seen; the share of units and dwellings other than houses has risen to 40 per cent, which would provide a more appropriate housing option for smaller households, according to Owen.\n\nShe said governments need to take more action to help stimulate change, however.\n\n\"Governments could make it more expensive to have more housing than you need, and cheaper to live in smaller housing,\" she said.\n\n\"Many advocate for tax reform like abolishing stamp duty - which makes it cheaper to move housing - and replacing it with a broad-based land tax, which raises costs the more land you own.\"",

So as we're walking up Crown Street, they said they were going to go into this hotel,\" he told ABC Illawarra Drive.\n\n\"I walked up to the mall and when I came back [to the venue] and walked up to the security guard, he said, 'Sorry mate, you can't come in'.

(Supplied)\n\nThe club apologised in a private message to Ms James but said it would continue to enforce a blanket ban on face and neck tattoos.\n\nAs a result of this and other similar cases, Queensland's anti-discrimination laws are under review and some individual clubs have changed their policies.\n\nThe Wollongong venue in question states in its dress code that uncovered neck, facial and head tattoos will not be accepted.\n\nAnti-Discrimination NSW referred the ABC to the Australian Human Rights Commission when asked about the legality of banning patrons from entering NSW clubs due to traditional facial tattoos.\n\nA spokesperson for the federal body said it was up to the courts to interpret racial discrimination laws.\n\nThe ABC contacted Clubs NSW to ask about its polices on facial tattoos but it failed to respond, and there was no freely available information about the policies on its website.\n\nThe ABC contacted the Wollongong hotel that refused Mr Gardiner entry for a response.",

(ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nThat rose tree has been placed where Annie was laid to rest, near the back patio overlooking the sprawling hills of grazing land at the family's Hillview cattle operation.\n\nMr Finger said Cathy, his wife of 47 years, was farewelled by hundreds in town before she was laid to rest at the Clermont Cemetery.\n\nHe said roses were Cathy's favourite flower.\n\n\"Annie and Catherine had, if there can be such a thing, a very good send off,\" he said.\n\n\"It was just an array of flowers and roses.\"\n\nFrank with muster dogs Lucky, Lucifer and Annie on the family property. (Supplied: Stock Chick Photography)\n\n'Brilliance \u2026 and unwavering support'\n\nMr Finger, a third-generation cattle farmer, was given Annie as a puppy for season one of Muster Dogs.\n\nAfter winning the television show, Annie became Mr Finger's prized dog on his Clermont property, working on mobs of cattle daily and demonstrating at working dog schools hosted by the family on weekends.\n\n\"I've just got to be thankful for the five years I've had, but I've only ever had two dogs with brilliance like she had and out of all the dogs I've had in 30 years,\" he said.\n\n\"I just had a good connection with her right from the very beginning and everywhere I went, she came with me.\"\n\nFrank and his family regularly host dog training schools. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nThe first working dog school since the family's heartbreak was held in Clermont at the weekend.\n\nIt was a tribute to Annie's brilliance and Mrs Finger's unwavering support of her family and the industry.\n\n\"Both were very genuine and both supported me in whatever I wanted to do,\" Mr Finger said.\n\n\"Cathy's probably most noted for a love for the grandchildren and our own children, of course, but the grandchildren they're the ones that are missing her very much.\"\n\nCathy Finger was adored by family and friends. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nMr Finger recalled a trip to Tasmania where he, Cathy and Annie were invited to make a guest appearance at an agricultural show just outside of Hobart.\n\n\"The organisers said they had about 5,000 people come, and I said to Cathy, 'Well, that's a lot, we'll have to do a good demo' and we drew 11,500 people on the day,\" he said.\n\n\" That's when I realised the effect Muster Dogs had on people. \"\n\nFrank's other Muster Dogs favourite, Lucifer, is missing Annie. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nAn unsung hero\n\nClermont residents have rallied behind the Finger family, with the outpouring of support evident throughout the close-knit community of about 3,000 people.\n\nGrazier and lifelong friend, Shane Benney, said Cathy was not one for the spotlight but she was always there for her rural community.\n\nFrank shares a special bond with all of his dogs. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\n\"She was a great supporter of the community always and a great supporter of Frank, very big supporter,\" he said.\n\n\"It's still hard to believe.\"\n\nFrank and his border collie Lucky, who also starred on Muster Dogs. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nLong-time resident Prue Lonergan said the Finger family was well-respected not only in Clermont but in all walks of farming life.\n\n\"The community is heartbroken for Frank at the moment in terms of how we support him moving on,\" she said.\n\n\"The Muster Dogs program only showed the world I suppose what their family is about.\n\n\"They're going to be missing Cath's dampers and everything she did behind the scenes was quite significant.\"\n\nFrank's new kelpie pup, Jonty, is being trained to join Lucifer and Lucky on the mustering team. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nBack on the farm, Mr Finger's new kelpie pup, Jonty, is learning the ropes to join his other Muster Dog favourites, Lucifer and Lucky, mustering cattle.\n\nIronically, the three-month-old brown pup has similar markings to Annie and hopefully one day her brilliance.\n\n\"A good dog is where they can smell cattle, find cattle, bring them out of the bush and just what to do without being told,\" Mr Finger said.\n\nFrank is known for his commitment to the agricultural industry. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nTogether, Mr Finger and Jonty represent the heart and future of Australia's working dog community.\n\n\"We'll still have our working dog and stock handling schools, probably not as many, but I think it'll do us good to get back into it again.\"",

(ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nLocals expect the opening of the town's new supermarket, backed by the Shire of Perenjori, will be a big time and cost saver.\n\nPerenjori Shire took out a $1.5 million loan and cashed in $500,000 of disaster recovery funding to get the project off the ground.\n\nShoppers came to Perenjori well-prepared with a groceries list.

(ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"[At the pub] you might have 20 meals one night and 130 meals the next so it's very hard, especially with fresh produce, to know how much to have on hand,\" he said.\n\n\"Our closest drive to a shop is Morawa \u2026 an 80km round trip just to buy some groceries so having this shop 100 metres from the pub is fantastic news for us.\"\n\nAmbrose Heelan's Red Emu Motel has been almost fully booked since it opened about a year ago.\n\nMr Heelan said being able to buy groceries in town would benefit his guests and staff.\n\nAmbrose Hill says he is proud his town can now offer a supermarket to guests and residents. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"I think every business sort of floats off each other, so the more people we bring to town, the more money they spend at the supermarket and cafe as well,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got staff here now and we don't have to travel [out of town] to the shop so hopefully we save a bit of money too.\"\n\n'Need, not a want'\n\nRecently retired shire chief executive Paul Anderson said he was proud the town would be given back an essential for daily life.\n\nPaul Anderson spearheaded the project to get a local supermarket off the ground. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"It's not just a want, it's an actual need for people,\" Mr Anderson said.\n\n\"Having a supermarket is one of the basic necessities of a community where you can walk down the street and buy your groceries and what you need for tea.\"\n\nMr Anderson said he hoped the shop would bring people back into town to make it \"brighter and more community orientated\".",

(Supplied)\n\n\"The really tricky thing about ovarian cancer is it manifests in many different ways \u2026 and spreads quite widely before it ever gets big enough to give you a symptom,\" she said.\n\n\"Many women have hoped that the medical system would do better to pick it up early, but the system is up against the perplexing biology of ovarian cancer, which is worsened by its rarity.\"\n\nKristin underwent treatment, which was successful, but 4.5 years later, the cancer returned.\n\nThe now-retired psychologist said one of the biggest challenges of dealing with a cancer diagnosis was navigating the health system and \"getting the right communication\" with her medical team.\n\n\"It is challenging for patients to get the best out of the medical system, so it became very important to me to try to optimise that communication,\" she said.\n\nWhen an opportunity came up to work with trainee health professionals to improve their understanding of gynaecological patients' lived experiences, Kristin knew she wanted to be involved.\n\n\"One of the really important things \u2026 is to share that message that [ovarian cancer] is difficult to diagnose, and how important it is to listen to the stories that women bring to the doctor,\" she said.\n\n\"If, through education and awareness, we can help a small number of people be diagnosed even a bit earlier, it's better than things staying the way they are.\"\n\nGynaecological cancers poorly understood\n\nThe volunteer-led program, Survivors Teaching Students, is a national initiative that brings ovarian and other gynaecological cancer survivors and caregivers into the classrooms of medical, nursing and other health professional students across the country.\n\nAlison Evans, CEO of the Australian and New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG), said the program was developed by the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance in the US and brought to Australia by ANZGOG in 2017.\n\n\"It's vital because it's really giving voice to what symptoms are, what diagnosis looks like, and what treatment looks like from a patient's perspective,\" Ms Evans told the Health Report.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn Australia, 19 women are diagnosed and six women die from gynaecological cancer every day.\n\nDespite this, Ms Evans said gynaecological cancers \u2014 which include uterine, endometrial, ovarian, vulval, vaginal and cervical \u2014 were poorly understood in the community.\n\n\"There's a stigma around these cancers because they are part of the reproductive system, and therefore they're hidden and they're very personal,\" she said.\n\nWith the exception of cervical screening, there are no early detection tests available, and as a result, gynaecological cancers often grow silently during the curable stage.\n\nMore than 100 volunteers currently participate in the Survivors Teaching Students program across Australia and New Zealand. (Supplied: ANZGOG)\n\nAdding to the challenge is the fact women may have symptoms overlooked or minimised by health professionals, which Ms Evans hopes the program will help to change.\n\n\" We ask women to know their body and to advocate for their body \u2026 it is vital that they are listened to and that doctors hear what these women are saying to them. \"\n\nShining a light on the patient experience\n\nSince 2017, Survivors Teaching Students volunteers have delivered in-person and online programs to more than 20,000 students across 22 universities in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDuring a typical session, students hear from three volunteers \u2014 including patients, carers and family members \u2014 about their personal experience with gynaecological cancer, including the physical, mental and emotional toll it takes.\n\n\"Patients are real people with lives and families, and we want the doctors and nurses of the future to see that,\" Kristin said.\n\nAfter 27 rounds of radiation, Alex wants urgent funding for gynaecological cancers Photo shows Zoe embraces her mum, Alex Neville, alongside twin sister Kate A new report has found gynaecological cancers have been among the poorest funded for almost two decades \u2014 these women hope to change that.\n\nOne of the key goals, she said, is to emphasise the importance of good health communication and compassionate care.\n\n\"Patients remember what doctors and nurses say, and that sometimes can be engraved in your mind forever.\"\n\nBut the most important part, according to Kristin, is answering the questions from students.\n\n\"Many students are really touched at an emotional level \u2026 and perhaps start to think they would consider a career in oncology or oncology-based research.\"\n\nLike many women with gynaecological cancer, Kristin Young experienced delays in getting a diagnosis. (Supplied)\n\nFurther research was critical for early detection and treatment options to be improved, Ms Evans said, particularly for the 55 per cent of gynaecological cancers considered rare or less common, which often had limited treatment options.\n\n\"We want doctors to be curious about these diseases for the rest of their career,\" she said.\n\n\"The most important thing is that GPs and nurses \u2026 have a voice in their head that is the woman's voice or the carer's voice that they take with them.\"\n\nLeaving a lasting legacy\n\nKristin said her own experience with ovarian cancer was proof that oncology research was having an impact.\n\n\"I'm a 'super responder' on one of these new molecular-based treatments \u2026 so the prognosis that I had, which was very poor, I have now outlived this, and I know that that represents hope,\" she said.\n\n\"Research is prolonging lives in some people and with more research it will prolong more lives.\"\n\nABC Health in your Instagram feed Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.\n\nIn addition to inspiring and educating the next generation of health professionals, she said the Survivors Teaching Students program had strengthened the community of people living with gynaecological cancer.\n\n\"At the very personal level, I have made good friends, what I feel are lifelong friends.\n\n\"The term lifelong is ironic in ovarian cancer because many of the women I have met \u2026 unfortunately have not had long lives. I have my contacts list and my phone is full of people who have passed away, but I never delete them.\"\n\nThe program helped people affected by gynaecological cancer leave a \"lasting legacy\", Ms Evans added.\n\n\"Many women and their families at the end of treatment are looking for a way to make a difference.\n\n\" It gives people a sense that they could take their experience of this disease and turn it into something good. \"\n\nListen to the full story and subscribe to the Health Report podcast for more.",

        "text": "Australian Nicola Olyslagers has defied the teeming rain to swan over the bar with just one bound and share the win in the Diamond League high jump in Switzerland.\n\nThe incessant downpour in Lausanne made it a fairly miserable night for athletes at the Swiss venue on Wednesday, local time, but you could not keep the smile from two-time Olympic silver medallist Olyslagers's face as she pulled off a successful gamble to share a three-way victory.\n\nDeciding to be the last jumper to enter the competition at 1.91m, Olyslagers feared the worst the more the track got deluged.\n\n\"This is a very wet competition, so I decided to be bold and start high, like I usually do when it's good conditions, and when the rain started pouring down, then I was thinking, 'have I made the right decision?'\" Olyslagers said.\n\n\"But in the end, it worked, because the one jump was the winning jump.\"\n\nIndeed, that proved her only clearance of the night as she went on to share first place with Germany's Christina Honsel \u2014 who had three successful jumps \u2014 and Poland's Maria \u017bodzik, who had four. They all failed at 1.94m.\n\nOlyslagers's perennial domestic rival Eleanor Patterson also cleared 1.91m, but a first-time failure at that height meant the other three shared the spoils.\n\nUkraine's Olympic champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh withdrew from the competition after two missed attempts at 1.86m and 1.91m, feeling it was not worth the risk with a wet run-up.\n\nThe 28-year-old Olyslagers is in fine form leading into the world championships, her major target of the year, but success in the season-long Diamond League, the finals of which take place in Zurich next week, is another incentive.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWhile Britain's Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson continued her comeback to racing with a meeting 800m record of 1 minute 55.69 seconds, Australia's new national record holder Claudia Hollingsworth had to settle for seventh in 1:58.81.\n\nLiam Adcock (7.50m) was eighth in the long jump, which was won by Uzbekistan's Anvar Anvarov (7.84), while Jack Rayner splashed home in 16th in the 5000m in 13:31.22.\n\nIn a non-Diamond League event, Aussie speedster Torrie Lewis won the 100m A final in 11.31sec.\n\nIn the meet's big 100m clash, Olympic champion Noah Lyles was beaten again by Oblique Seville, with the Jamaican's 9.87-second run hugely impressive in the conditions. Lyle clocked 10.02 seconds in his third straight 100m loss on the Diamond League circuit.\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Bridget McArthur)\n\nAt a mining industry breakfast on Tuesday, WA Premier Roger Cook continued to talk up the deal.\n\n\"Poles and wires may not sound sexy \u2026 but the sexiness is in what they will achieve,\" he said.\n\n\"The Pilbara's network of mines largely run on fossil fuels. As a result, the Pilbara contributes around 40 per cent of the state's emissions.\n\n\" Eliminating those emissions will not only make the Pilbara the most sustainable mining precinct in the world, it will also take out a huge chunk of state and national emissions. \"\n\nRoger Cook says it's important to reduce the emissions produced in the Pilbara. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nBut the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has confirmed to the ABC not a single dollar has been allocated to specific projects under that deal.\n\n\"That means that any attempts at decarbonisation, in particular in the North-West Interconnected System, have been set back by years whilst the state government messes around with money that's siting on the table,\" the state's Shadow Energy Minister Steve Thomas said.\n\nNo investments made\n\nThe CEFC signed high-level agreements with the New South Wales, Tasmanian and Victorian governments in late 2022 with references to specific projects which would be invested in.\n\nThe Rewiring the Nation fund is designed to upgrade the electricity grid to deliver renewable energy.

(ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nNow, the government plans to run an expression of interest for four new bulk-billed clinics within the first 100 days, \"based on evidence of need\".\n\nThe Liberals have also promised to release updated costings on the leasing arrangement for Spirit of Tasmania IV, which was docked in Scotland from late 2024 and is due to reach Tasmanian waters this week.\n\nWorking with the new crossbench\n\nThe government needs either Labor or at least four crossbenchers in order to pass legislation. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nWithout a majority in parliament, the Liberals have made a number of policy concessions to win over crossbenchers, including phasing out greyhound racing, abandoning a plan to release more native forest for logging and, most recently, a pause on salmon farming expansions while an independent review of the industry takes place.\n\nAnd the Liberals will need to continue appeasing the crossbench if they want to stay in power for a full four years.\n\n\"There's no time for hubris.

He said he was \"blindsided\" by the move.\n\n\"I'm not going to give Jeremy a free ride, and I've got a better chance of getting a better outcome for my constituents being inside the tent rather than outside, so every time Jeremy gets comfortable in his sleeping bag, I'm going to be kicking it,\" he said.\n\nCarlo Di Falco says he will make sure Mr Rockliff does not get complacent.

It was an important game for us even though it didn\u2019t go the way we wanted it to, I wanted to play it.\u201d Simpkin, who met Surjan at Clovelly Beach six years ago, said his head was a mess when he ran onto the field.\n\n\u201cI had a good chat to Chez [Daly Cherry-Evans], he was pretty good to me,\u201d Simpkin said. Loading \u201cHe just said I\u2019m not a chance today, just take a second and breathe. When you get out there, obviously there were all the formalities at the start of the game, he was just \u2018take that time, that minute or two to just have a couple of breaths and just clear your mind before the game.\u2019 \u201cThat helped me, I had a couple of moments like that. Everyone was really good, they got me in shape and ready to go pretty quickly, so it was good.\u201d Simpkin said it has been an eye-opening adjustment to footy with fatherhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, just the sleep and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe made me do the first nappy, it is disgusting \u2026I was saying to her if we did this at the start of the year, I would have struggled just with the sleep and adjusting to everything. \u201cHopefully we win all of our games and see what happens, but if that doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019re pretty close to the end of the season, so it\u2019s not too bad anyway.\u201d Graham still in pain but keen to rush field for Johnston\u2019s try milestone Campbell Graham\u2019s back injury has been so painful that the South Sydney centre struggles getting out of chairs and driving long distances. But it won\u2019t stop him being the first one running onto the field when teammate Alex Johnston finally breaks the NRL\u2019s try-scoring record.\n\nJohnston needs four more tries to pass Ken Irvine\u2019s mark of 212 four-pointers, but time is running out for the winger to enter rarefied air this season. The 15th-placed Rabbitohs host St George Illawarra on Thursday night for their penultimate game before facing bitter rivals Sydney Roosters after a bye. Souths officials have publicly urged fans not to storm the field once Johnston finally breaks the record, as supporters did when AFL star Lance Franklin kicked his 1000th goal in 2022.

Obviously it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, so we\u2019ll just see how it plays out,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a monkey on his back for a couple of years now. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great achievement, not only in our game but in Australian sport to have a record like that. It really couldn\u2019t happen to a better person.\u201d Seeing his mate break the record would be a rare bright spot in a tough season for Graham, who has been troubled by a bulging disc in his back since March.

Credit: Getty Images The injury is unlikely to require off-season surgery but has nevertheless been \u201cpretty rough\u201d for Graham to handle. Loading \u201cSimple things like driving long distances is not great, getting up out of chairs, stuff like that. It isn\u2019t ideal, day to day,\u201d Graham said of his pain. \u201cIt does get you pretty down, even just day to day, dealing with a chronic issue like that. My focus is just to get on top of this, not only for footy but for myself as well. At the moment, the goal is to be back fit and training by pre-season.\u201d\n\nAnother disrupted year was a tough pill to swallow for Graham, who had been hampered by a sternum injury across the previous two seasons. The sternum issues forced Graham to withdraw from NSW\u2019s squad for the 2023 State of Origin series opener and eventually sidelined him from Souths\u2019 entire 2024 campaign. But Graham is hopeful his luck will turn in 2026, when Souths will fight to recover from a season of injury horror across the board. \u201cThat\u2019s something that helps me in my mindset, that although I\u2019ve had a pretty unlucky run the last couple of years I know things will get better,\u201d he said. \u201cI know if I keep doing the right things, I\u2019ll give myself every chance to be fully fit by pre-season.\u201d AAP Murray lifting training standards as Rabbitohs get their groove back\n\nChristian Nicolussi Cameron Murray has been credited with helping South Sydney win their past two games, simply by returning from injury and lifting the standards at training. The Rabbitohs\u2019 skipper was not named to return from an Achilles injury for Thursday night\u2019s clash against St George Illawarra, while Latrell Mitchell was also left off the team sheet as he continues to battle a nerve issue in his back. The sight of Murray back in full training at Heffron Park has been the circuit-breaker the Bunnies needed, according to injured representative centre Campbell Graham.\n\n\u201cThe way he leads and communicates with the boys out there, you can see training has gone up a gear,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIn all honesty, I think he has helped contribute to our wins the last couple of weeks, just with his presence. \u201cCam is giving himself every opportunity to get back and play. The medical staff aren\u2019t pushing him, but Cam is his own man, and if he feels like he\u2019s ready, he\u2019ll push to play. Souths skipper Cameron Murray Credit: NRL Images \u201cJust seeing someone like that and how dedicated he is to his rehab, how professional he has been about the whole thing \u2013 he hasn\u2019t left any stone unturned \u2013 it\u2019s pretty admirable.\u201d\n\nMurray and Mitchell went down within minutes of each other in the pre-season, with the captain rupturing his Achilles tendon. He wants to play in the last round against the Sydney Roosters if fit, and has the full blessing of coach Wayne Bennett. The easy thing would be to keep Murray on ice and let him be fresh for day one of 2026 pre-season training, but as Bennett said recently, \u201cHe wants to reward himself for nine months of rehab. Even if it\u2019s just a couple of games, it\u2019s a game he loves, and it\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t been able to do.\u201d Mitchell has also had an injury-interrupted year, with the latest back injury forcing him to miss another week. With the bye next week, he is also a chance to return for the Roosters. Campbell Graham helps launch the Telstra Footy Country Round at East Hills on Tuesday. Credit: Kate Geraghty/SMH Bennett acknowledged the role Murray had played by being back at training, but was equally complimentary of Mitchell and Cody Walker, who both played big roles in their returns against the Titans and Eels, respectively.\n\n\u201cCam is a pretty exceptional guy, he\u2019s one of the elite players in the game with his attitude, and everything he does is at 100 per cent,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe appreciate him being back at training, but the wins also come down to having quality players on the field. Cody and Latrell have played the last two weeks; they\u2019ve been really good for us and made a difference.\u201d Meanwhile, Graham, who missed all of last year with a sternum injury, then broke his hand in the off-season, injured his calf in round three, and has not been sighted since round 18, confirmed a back complaint had left him with mental demons. He has avoided surgery and been limited to pilates, swimming and physiotherapy, with the aim of resuming running in the pre-season.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t leave you in a good headspace, especially after the year I had last year, it\u2019s just been very stop-start,\u201d Graham said. \u201cNot feeling at your physical best for such a long time, it gets pretty draining.\u201d In team news, Isaah Yeo has been named on an extended bench for the Panthers when they host Canberra in Mudgee on Friday, Ryan Papenhuyzen (concussion) was listed in jersey No.21 for Friday night\u2019s Storm clash with the Bulldogs, Sydney Roosters winger Daniel Tupou (concussion) is replaced by Junior Tupou for their trip to Parramatta, while Krystian Mapapalangi is the centre named on the Wests Tigers\u2019 extended bench in case Starford To\u2019o (shoulder) is not fit. A summer to relish breaking Irvine\u2019s record sits fine with AJ Alex Johnston hopes to break Ken Irvine\u2019s all-time try-scoring record at the start of next season \u2013 not in the coming weeks \u2013 so he can have all summer to savour the prospect of achieving the historic feat. Johnston failed to add to his career tally against Parramatta on the weekend to remain on 209 tries, three shy of Irvine\u2019s long-standing mark.\n\nThe player marking him on Thursday night, when the Rabbitohs take on St George Illawarra, will be former Rabbitoh Corey Allan, who gave Johnston the easiest try of his career in the final round of 2020. Johnston needed five tries in the final round to finish as that year\u2019s top try-scorer, and Allan got across the line, only to wait for Johnston to catch up to him and give him the ball to score. Allan said he was yet to receive the carton of beer Johnston had promised. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for that case \u2013 it will be interesting to see if it ever rocks up at my doorstep,\u201d Allan said. \u201cI could have scored that night, but I thought I better look behind me to see if he was coming. He needed five to draw level with Kyle Feldt [on the top try-scorers list]. Lo and behold, he was screaming my name, and his eyes lit up when I turned around. The rest is history.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the record will be broken again. \u2018AJ\u2019 is a special player.\u201d Alex Johnston and Corey Allan celebrate that try in 2020. Credit: Getty Images Johnston said of Allan: \u201cHopefully he can help me with a couple of more tries this weekend.\u201d South Sydney coach Wayne Bennett said after the win over the Eels that the likely return of Latrell Mitchell to left centre would help Johnston in his quest to break the record. \u201cI love playing with \u2018T-Mitt\u2019 [Mitchell],\u201d Johnston said. \u201cCody Walker has given me most of my tries, but Trell would be the second most.\n\n\u201cI sort of only want to get three tries this year, that way I\u2019ve got the whole off-season and the lead-up [to] next year to try and get it in round one. A hat-trick this weekend will see Alex Johnston draw level with Ken Irvine\u2019s long-standing try record. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what I should do [to celebrate]. I\u2019ll have to do something.\u201d Souths have asked fans not to storm the playing pitch when Johnston reaches the milestone, but the winger has other ideas. \u201cI think it will happen, and the NRL and Souths will have to be prepared for it to happen,\u201d Johnston said.\n\n\u201cThere were pretty crazy scenes in the AFL when [Sydney Swans forward Lance] Buddy Franklin [kicked 1000 goals], so there will be a lot that goes on behind the scene to make sure it is safe. I\u2019m all for it. I think the NRL will need to prepare for it.\u201d The Bunnies are chasing three straight wins, while the Dragons need three replacements, for Jack de Belin, Hamish Stewart and Hame Sele, who were all ruled out with category-one concussion symptoms on the weekend. Why Haas chose Samoa Dan Walsh Queensland Origin centre Rob Toia will prioritise his Tongan heritage over a potential Ashes tour berth as fellow Kangaroos defector Payne Haas declared Samoa now has the playing stocks to win next year\u2019s World Cup.\n\nHaas confirmed on Sunday his switch of allegiance to the rising Pacific nation, with high hopes that fellow Australian stars Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow do the same for this year\u2019s Pacific Championships. Tonga\u2019s October 26 clash with Samoa at Suncorp Stadium is predicted to draw one of the best Test attendances in decades on Australian soil and outsell the 33,196 who turned out for Australia\u2019s win over the Mate Ma\u2019a in Brisbane last year. Toia\u2019s decision to represent his family\u2019s Tongan roots does, however, take another outside back option off the table for Australia\u2019s three-Test tour of the UK in October and November. Big names Latrell Mitchell and Tom Trbojevic loom as the Kangaroos\u2019 first-choice centre pairing for the first Ashes tour since 2003. However, both have been hampered by injury as South Sydney and Manly have struggled this season, and arguments could be made for them focusing on club commitments given their injury histories.\n\nToia\u2019s rise as a rookie of the year contender and an eye-catching debut Origin series keeping Mitchell quiet had him in Kevin Walters\u2019 sights, particularly given Stephen Crichton (Samoa), Valentine Holmes (torn rotator cuff) and Campbell Graham are unavailable for Australia.

Melbourne\u2019s Xavier Coates, Canterbury\u2019s Matt Burton and Jacob Kiraz, Parramatta\u2019s Zac Lomax and Josh Addo-Carr, and Roosters rugby convert Mark Nawaqanitawase loom as Australia\u2019s other leading three-quarter options. Under current international eligibility rules, Toia\u2019s opting to play for Tonga after coach Kristian Woolf got in contact won\u2019t preclude him from representing Australia or New Zealand (where his father was born), just as Haas\u2019s call won\u2019t impact his NSW Origin career.\n\n\u201cWoolfy reached out, and I responded. I was very surprised to be honest, but I told him I\u2019d love the opportunity to play for Tonga if he was to choose me,\u201d Toia said. Payne Haas has confirmed his allegiance switch to Samoa. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI had a chat with my parents about it, telling them that opportunity was there, and they were over the moon. My grandparents on both sides have lived in Tonga the majority of their lives, so they were probably the happiest. They were telling me they can\u2019t wait to see me represent them if that happens.\u201d League Immortal Andrew Johns on Sunday likened Haas\u2019s decision to represent Samoa to Jason Taumalolo\u2019s generational switch to Tonga for the 2017 World Cup. Haas said he was inspired by the North Queensland veteran\u2019s move, though he was reluctant to put public pressure on Fa\u2019asuamaleaui to follow his lead.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we get a few more boys over, but they have to follow their heart and do what\u2019s right for them,\u201d Haas said. \u201cTo play with [Fa\u2019asuamaleaui] would be special. I hope he makes the switch.\u201d Haas said on Sunday that new Australian coach Walters was understanding of his decision, which was first set in motion when he played against Samoa in 2023, and the island\u2019s national anthem played. Haas, Crichton, Jarome Luai, Brian To\u2019o and Terrell May headline an already star-studded Samoan contingent under coach Ben Gardiner, prompting Haas\u2019s prediction of World Cup glory at next year\u2019s tournament. \u201cI feel like we can win it, especially with the team we have got now,\u201d Haas said.",

Fair Work has launched an investigation into the company. One Transport NSW proposal contained in the documents shows the centre of the light rail stop covering Palings Lane, which divides Merivale\u2019s CBD headquarters. But the proposed stop would have blocked access to Merivale\u2019s Ivy restaurant precinct, which houses restaurants Uccello and Felix as well as its VIP club Level 6. The Wynyard light rail stop out the front of Merivale venues. Credit: Edwina Pickles Instead, the light rail stop was constructed further away from Wynyard and closer to Angel Place, allowing Merivale to expand its al fresco dining outside its restaurant Totti\u2019s. Merivale was also able to secure a \u201csuper taxi rank\u201d on Pitt Street to ferry customers away from the Ivy. The company did not respond to requests for comment about its lobbying of Transport for NSW. A spokesperson for Transport for NSW said a wide range of factors were considered during the planning of the major new public transport project, which had an extensive and lengthy design process, involving public consultation and stakeholder feedback.\n\n\u201cTransport considered a variety of locations for the Wynyard Light Rail stop and its design went through a number of iterations throughout the planning process,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFactors taken into consideration included pedestrian safety, crowding, traffic, road interfaces, platform size, positioning in relation to train stations and other key infrastructure, drainage, accessibility and distance to locations and services.\u201d The construction of the light rail was dogged by repeated delays, legal battles and prolonged disruption, leaving smaller businesses struggling to survive with debts of up to $500,000. Emanuel Tzirtzilakis, the owner of a cafe on Devonshire Street in Surry Hills, told a NSW Parliamentary inquiry in 2018 that he had been driven to the \u201cbrink of financial ruin\u201d by the project.\n\nConstance led a $31 million compensation scheme for some businesses, but others have taken their claims to the High Court after the NSW government won an appeal against further compensation in 2023. Constance became closer to Hemmes as the hospitality baron expanded his empire into Narooma in Constance\u2019s electorate of Bega. Hemmes bought the Glasshouse Rocks estate in 2017 and now owns four venues and several expansive waterfront properties. Loading The former transport minister, who declined to comment, was regularly seen at events at the Ivy, including parties hosted by Liberal lobbyist and Hemmes\u2019 political consigliere Michael Photios, who ensured the 52-year-old\u2019s relationships reached the top of the Liberal Party. In January 2022, two days after New Year\u2019s Eve, NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet scheduled a meeting with Hemmes at Constance\u2019s home, a separate set of documents released under freedom of information laws reveals.\n\n\u201c7:30pm Private Drink-Dinner: Premier/Andrew Constance/Justin Hemmes,\u201d the calendar invite from Perrottet shows. \u201cWhere: Andrew Constance Property\u201d. When the trio met up, it was not at Constance\u2019s home in Moruya but Hemmes\u2019 60-hectare mansion in Narooma. The scheduled meeting was never disclosed in the premier\u2019s ministerial diary entries. The rules governing ministerial diary entries do not require ministers to disclose social events but cautions them to make public any \u201csubstantive discussion of issues\u201d that may be considered by the minister. The documents show Hemmes would personally email Perrottet\u2019s office to request meetings, including one to discuss Merivale\u2019s unsolicited proposal for the commercial development of Hunter Street metro station, which went ahead on 14 December 2021 and was disclosed in ministerial diary entries.\n\nBut another titled \u201c6pm catch up. Justin Hemmes\u201d on September 15, 2022 at his restaurant Felix, was not disclosed. The former premier declined to comment. In his previous role as state treasurer, Perrottet became a key supporter of ending the lockout laws that had dented Hemmes\u2019 hospitality empire and put restrictions on the wider industry. Perrottet appointed the billionaire to his Treasury advisory council in 2018. As premier, Perrottet described him as a \u201cpub doyen\u201d in 2021 and lauded him for his plans to revitalise the CBD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Perrottet and Hemmes unsuccessfully lobbied then federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, one of Hemmes\u2019 close friends, for an extension of JobKeeper and pushed for a repeal of the fringe benefits tax to encourage corporate long lunches. Perrottet arrives at the Ivy in August 2024 with his wife Helen. Credit: Wolter Peeters After Constance resigned as transport minister and triggered a by-election in Bega in 2022, a briefing from Perrottet\u2019s office spruiked Hemmes\u2019 establishments in Narooma during a campaign stop to highlight a $4 million upgrade to Narooma wharf, which helps service Merivale venues and other restaurants in the southern inlet.\n\nWhen Perrottet resigned as premier in 2023, he had a three-hour lunch at Hemmes\u2019 restaurant Felix. A year later, when he left state parliament, the Ivy and the penthouse that is home to the infamous private members club, Level 6, hosted Perrottet\u2019s farewell. Merivale paid for the former premier\u2019s send-off. The gift did not need to be disclosed because Perrottet left parliament that day. Ministerial diaries show the former state Liberal government had 20 meetings with Merivale between 2019 and 2023, involving the premier, police minister, transport minister, and treasurer. NSW Labor Premier Chris Minns has had two meetings with Merivale since being elected in 2023. Hemmes and his companies have donated more than $350,000 to the Liberal Party since 2018, Australian Electoral Commission records show, while hosting fundraisers with prime ministers at his mansion, the Hermitage, now estimated to be worth $200 million, as part of his decade-long campaign for greater political influence. Internal messages show the company has also targeted men with political capital, including former chiefs of staff in the state government, for special treatment by offering them complimentary Level 6 memberships.\n\nLoading In 2021, Merivale secured one of the biggest government catering contracts in the state: a six-year multimillion-dollar deal under a competitive tender by the Liberal government run by Venues NSW to provide food and drinks at two of Sydney\u2019s largest stadiums, the SCG and Allianz. The state Labor government has put the company on notice, signalling that any plans to renew the contract are under threat following the allegations of exploitation, harassment and underpayment revealed by this masthead. \u201cWe should make sure that we do everything we can to keep workers safe, particularly young women workers who are vulnerable to exploitation in these circumstances,\u201d NSW Legislative Council member Dr Sarah Kaine, the government\u2019s procurement inquiry chair, said in July. The company is also in a $124 million dispute with the state government over the compulsory acquisition of two properties it bought opposite Wynyard Station for $77 million in 2018, which it had planned to turn into \u201cIvy 2.0\u201d as part of its $3 billion property empire.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The appointment of Maud Page as the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s first female director in 154 years marks a historic moment for the state\u2019s six galleries and museums. All are now headed by women: Annette Pitman leads Museums of History of NSW; Dr Caroline Butler-Bowdon, the State Library of NSW; Kim McKay, the Australian Museum; Louise Herron, the Sydney Opera House; and Lisa Havilah, the Powerhouse Museum. Last year, their cultural institutions welcomed more than eight million visitors, commanded operational budgets of more than $600 million and employed 2200 full-time staff. They lead in the tricky aftermath of COVID, which temporarily shut their doors, reshaped public buying habits globally and played havoc with the costs of doing business. Audiences are changing, at once more informed, and increasingly sophisticated but also weaned on novelty; time poor and distracted.

Credit: Wolter Peeters Their museums and galleries are under pressure to leverage technology and enhance visitor experience, without turning their halls into places of entertainment, or quasi-wedding venues. Many occupy heritage sites built at the high watermark of the British Empire, their collections over-represented when it comes to the works, perspectives and deeds of white men, and all the while their budgets are under pressure, as they seek new funding streams that can bring ethical dilemmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpectrum sat down with the leaders in the boardroom of the Australian Museum to talk budgets, philanthropy and future directions. Annette Pitman, you lead Museums of History of NSW, but before that, you were chief executive of Create NSW, and you have had the benefit of sitting in on countless budget meetings. Can you set the scene: What is the reality of the financial climate that the state\u2019s major galleries and museums currently find themselves in? Annette Pitman: I think we are in a period of unprecedented demand for what we do. The pandemic really made people appreciate what cultural institutions provide and appreciate the gathering that happens around culture in these spaces. We are incredibly nimble at doing really cutting-edge and meaningful things with small budgets. So we are in a period where we\u2019ll have to be at our most creative. Kim McKay with a favourite object from the Australian Museum collection: a Pormpuraaw Ghost Net sculpture, made from discarded plastic commercial fishing nets, lines and traps. Ghost nets drift in the ocean and create a deadly hazard for marine life before washing up on beaches. In the late 1980s, McKay co-founded Clean Up Australia and saw first-hand the devastation ghost nets cause. Credit: Wolter Peeters Are cultural institutions out of the woods post-pandemic, Louise Herron? Louise Herron: Our audience statistics suggest many of the worst of the COVID impacts are behind us. Even in the current cost-of-living crisis, people will still save up and go to see the performers they love. Since COVID, we have become more intentional and analytical about what we do. People got out of the habit of going out, so we need to be even more conscious of who we are trying to attract \u2013 be that children, Pasifika people, contemporary music fans. We keep working to let people know we do a lot more than opera, though opera still accounts for a bit more than 10 per cent of tickets sold. Kim McKay: The fact that we are free for all to come into and enjoy the museum (yes, you pay for special exhibitions and programming) is especially important in a cost-of-living crisis and tight budgets. It\u2019s a way to level the playing field. I see migrant families, three generations in the one family coming in together because all people want their kids to be exposed to knowledge and learning. The Australian Museum brings in one and a half million people a year but imagine if we could reach 10 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Holy Grail for cultural institutions is the 18 to 30-year-olds. How does the Art Gallery of NSW engage with these young adults? Maud Page: Our youth engagement strategy begins in early childhood. [We] do that through artist-led children\u2019s programming, like Hive Festival, which attracted more than 28,000 visitors over one weekend in January. If you bring in children, you bring in their aunties, their cousins, their grandparents and their parents and you provide an experience that resonates with all ages. The magic has to come from education, but people don\u2019t want to be dictated to any more. They want to be enthralled. So in our case, it is all about stepping into experimental music like Grammy Award-winning artist Solange in 2023 and ARIA award-winning Northern Territory rock band King Stingray, who last month attracted more than 6000 visitors to the Art Gallery in one night. Maud Page holds an Aurukun fire stick gifted to her from artist. \u201cIt took me a long time to fall pregnant. The fabulous artist Tony Albert had begun at Queensland Art Gallery in the same week as me. After three years working together, in 2005, my daughter Alia was born. Sharing in my exultation, Tony gave me a rare Aurukun fire stick made by Joe Ngallametta. Joe passed away not long after and this beautiful object represented birth and death but also the beginning of a learning journey into the extraordinary world of First Nations art. Credit: Wolter Peeters And yet, your gallery has been accused in the Murdoch press of being too woke. Maud Page: It is a very reductive description of what we do, and I would say every single institution around this table is open and generous and welcoming to everyone. The art gallery showcases such a broad spectrum of artistic voices and contemporary and historical art that offers an enriching experience for all visitors. Writing and reading are somewhat old-fashioned ideas in the internet age, Caroline Butler-Bowdon. How does the state\u2019s oldest library survive? Caroline Butler-Bowdon: Books and stories are just as relevant today and remain at the heart of libraries. But libraries have always evolved, and today they\u2019re also places for creativity, lifelong learning and social connection. People used to go to cathedrals and other sorts of places for a sense of connection but these days they are coming to our institutions for the same experience. We work with the Sydney Writers\u2019 Festival, Sydney Film Festival, Mardi Gras and it\u2019s through partnerships and collaboration that we build audiences, we diversify our audiences. We\u2019ve had a 25 per cent growth in visitation in one year. The core ingredients are essential services, magical experiences and everything in between using social media to share stories, to share our research and depth and drive audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouise Herron: You definitely need to have a clear ambition and ours is to be Everyone\u2019s House. Last night, one of Australia\u2019s heaviest metal bands, Parkway Drive, played to a sold-out Concert Hall of 2500 people, backed by a full symphony orchestra. Almost 80 per cent of the audience was new to the Opera House. Some people were so disappointed to miss out on tickets that they came anyway and stood on the Forecourt during the concert, many in black tie. We\u2019re looking for artists or genres that will bring new audiences to the Opera House. And if one of our organisations connects with a new community, it helps all of us. Annette Pitman holds Laminex samples circa 1956. \u201cThis post-war period marked a series of shifts in Australian society; housing boom, Australian Dream, kitchen becoming the heart of the home. Laminex was produced in hundreds of colours and patterns; something for every home, and as a result this durable, practical and affordable Australian made product became ubiquitous in our homes.\u201d Credit: Wolter Peeters Lisa Havilah, you are building a cultural institution from scratch on the banks of the Parramatta River. If you build it, will the crowds come? Lisa Havilah: One of the reasons the museum at Parramatta is designed to be so vertical is to give as much green space as is possible back to the community and wrapping around each of the exhibition spaces with public space that will lead to an open rooftop. It\u2019s in the mix of public space, exhibition space, amenity and experience that we hope to make the museum a part of somebody\u2019s everyday life. We are creating exhibitions that people can immerse themselves in in new ways, like working with architects, presenting the collection in new ways that engage young audiences. Because you might come to an exhibition, you might come to have dinner, you might come to just sit in the garden or you might come with your family to sit on the riverbank. Loading So, why do you say the traditional show-and-tell model of programming is on the way out? Lisa Havilah: Museums need to change and move more than they used to. Exhibitions need to change. Stories need to shift and become more relevant. Historically, museum exhibitions have been very didactic, presenting one position on an object or one story. So it\u2019s about giving space for people\u2019s perspectives, their own histories and memories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim McKay: In our early years, our institutions didn\u2019t engage with First Nations people. It\u2019s very different now. Why should we speak for First Nations people when they can speak for themselves? Museums of History of NSW cares for 12 house museums, and a written archive that dates to 1788, the arrival of the First Fleet. Annette Pitman, how do you avoid romanticising the past, and how do you represent an Australia that has changed since the foundational times of those house museums? Loading Annette Pitman: History is messy, right? It\u2019s a multidimensional thing and no matter what topic we might be talking about, with the hindsight of time, we come to understand it differently. I think the public understands this, especially today when we see so much manipulation of the truth. There is value to be found in the information we hold about our past. We\u2019re partnering with the Aboriginal Languages Trust on a wonderful program that supports First Nations teams to go through our archives and identify references to culture and language that aren\u2019t known. So there are ways we can engage without sugar-coating what\u2019s happened and that\u2019s our duty as a public institution. Museums and galleries pitch themselves as places of public trust at a time of misinformation, but do you run the danger of turning culture into a commodity? Annette Pitman: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with making quality content entertaining. We just had a kids program called Beautiful waterways, Stinky Sewers that drew 7000 kids from all over NSW who came to the Tank Stream and learn the history of public sanitation. I think we\u2019re clever enough to navigate that line. Caroline Butler-Bowdon with Dorothea Mackellar\u2019s 1907-1908 poetry notebook from the library\u2019s collection, the only known manuscript of her iconic poem Core of My Heart, later renamed My Country. \u201cThe poem is still loved today for its enduring themes, and shows just how powerfully words can spark creativity, stir emotion, and stay meaningful across generations. The same can be said for libraries. What I love is that it was first written when Dorothea was just 19 years old. Our reading rooms are full of young people, studying and creating and it\u2019s nice to think that a future Dorothea indeed could be one of them.\u201d Credit: Wolter Peeters\n\nAdvertisement",

I need to feel the love to be physical. I need a good night\u2019s sleep and a bit of quiet, then I might be in the mood.

Tim said, \u201cPull over at the nearest pub, Mr and Mrs Madam, we need to talk to you. I want to be with your daughter forever.\u201d It went so well that now I think they favour him over me!

Other gold stocks also gained. Evolution Mining was up 1.8 per cent and Newmont rose 1.3 per cent.\n\nA flurry of local company results took investor attention away from Wall Street, where indexes ended mixed as the sell-down of AI superstars such as Nvidia continued, albeit at a more muted pace.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 climbed 65.90 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 8983.90 as of 11.05am AEST, with nine of its 11 industry sectors in the green, led by industrials, mining and consumer stocks. The ASX added 0.3 per cent on Wednesday. The Australian dollar was 0.3 per cent lower at US64.34\u00a2.\n\nThe Australian sharemarket opened stronger this morning, putting it on track for a new record on one of the busiest days of reporting season.\n\nMining giants BHP, Fortescue Metals and Rio Tinto also advanced, rising 1.2 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. So did the big four banks, with CBA up 0.1 per cent, Westpac rising 0.7 per cent, NAB up 0.2 per cent and ANZ Bank up 0.5 per cent, respectively. Mining and financial stocks make up more than half of the ASX, so even small movements can steer the wider market.\n\nBrambles shares climbed 5.2 per cent. The pallet supplier this morning announced a share buyback of up to $US400 million ($622.5 million) and declared a final dividend of US20.83\u00a2 a share, taking its payout for the year to US39.83\u00a2, up 17 per cent from the last year, as an efficiency drive helped it improve profits.\n\nOn the flip side, Whitehaven Coal shed 2.3 per cent after reporting its underlying net profit fell by more than half to $319 million in the past financial year, with earnings markedly slowing in the second half as coal prices declined. The news came a day after Yancoal, the nation\u2019s biggest pure play coal producer, said its revenues fell in the June half despite a higher coal output because of weaker prices. Yancoal\u2019s shares added 0.4 per cent after their 11.4 per cent loss on Wednesday.\n\nAnd James Hardie\u2019s horror sell-down continued, with the share price falling another 8.2 per cent after plummeting 27.8 per cent on Wednesday after the home cladding maker said its full-year net income was down 60 per cent as sales in its key US market declined. Demand in home repairs, renovations and new construction is \u201cchallenging\u201d, it warned.\n\nSuper Retail Group, which owns the Rebel sports, Supercheap Auto and Macpac chains, jumped 13.9 per cent. They hit a record high after the company said it boosted sales by 4.5 per cent to a record $4.1 billion in the past financial year, with growth accelerating in the second half.",

Source: AAP / James Ross\n\nWhat did the investigation find?\n\nThe investigation focused on the university's \"use of staff and students' Wi-Fi location data, and was expanded to include the university's review of a small group of staff members' email accounts\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation found the university \"contravened\" two different IPPs when using the Wi-Fi data.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the number of people impacted and the level of the impact, the deputy commissioner determined the breaches were \"serious\".\n\n\n\nThe privacy principles were about whether the university \"properly informed students and staff about how their personal information would be used\" and if the use of data was \"consistent with the primary purpose of collecting this information or was for an authorised secondary purpose\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation, however, did not find any breaches in relation to staff email accounts.\n\n\n\nWhat did the university say?\n\nKapobassis said in a statement that the university \"takes its privacy obligations seriously and has cooperated openly and responsively to the deputy commissioner in the conduct of her investigation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging the university could have provided clearer notice, she said \"the use of WiFi location data in student misconduct cases was reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The university has already completed a number of actions that are proposed in the final report, and all others are progressing. We will ensure the university community is kept informed as these changes are made.\"\n\n\n\n",

So growth should really reflect unit price inflation plus growth in Australia's population.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAutism peak body Aspect said families needed the right level of support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Given the number of autistic children we support through our schools and therapy programs, families must have confidence there will be continuity of supports, real choice and control, and no gaps during the transition,\" chief executive Jacqui Borland said.\n\n\n\n",

It is amazing being able to go out - and go out bush - and listen to their stories and their families; and their history. And it is amazing. There is no experience like it. And I feel so grateful to be part of it, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the perspective is something she will inform her approach to treating patients going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe that nursing and health science and medicine is all about patient-centred care and holistic care. So being in community and really bonding and connecting with community from the roots is where it starts; and how you make those relationships and connections.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysiotherapy student Tameka was able to join the program as part of partnership with the University of Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the experience has been eye-opening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a couple of programs. There is a lot of chronic kidney disease. So just over this weekend, I have met people that doing research in renal disease - and through that I have now got research papers that have been made and done on Indigenous community to prevent renal failures. And how to keep them active while doing dialysis and things. So just this event - with the networking and meeting new people. And having a yarn to different people has just been so great in so many different aspects.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared with the general population, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are five times more likely to develop kidney disease; and four times more likely to die from kidney disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nTameka says she will be taking the insights into her final placement at a hospital in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has just been a completely different way of treating. You've got the clinical side of the way we've been taught; and the way we think and things like that. But having to bring that into the culture aspect has been really interesting. Understanding the difference between the men and women and the way they function together and separately. And what can and can't be done together, is just incredible. And trying to work out different ways of how to interpret that; and how to get it working within the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLarrakia traditional owner Richard Fejo is the senior elder on campus at Flinders University.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a member of Stolen Generations, he is passionate about improving the health outcomes of Indigenous Australians, who die between - on average - between 8 and 9 years** earlier than the wider population.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he has taken immense joy out of seeing the students graduate with bush medicine knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it is really important to actually demonstrate that. We actually have a beautiful culture. So out here Yolngu talk a lot about kinship. And this is a system that most Australians are unaware of. But through the systems we are able to interact better with Aboriginal people and Aboriginal patients. And if a doctor has an understanding of this, we are then setting a standard that can be applied across the board in different disciplines for better interactions with Aboriginal people, amounting to better outcomes across the social determinants of health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says he is already seeing change.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "More than half a million permanent migrants in Australia are working below their skill level, despite concerns that widespread workforce shortages are impeding productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a topic of discussion this week, as 30 leaders from business, unions and civil society convene in Canberra to debate the country's economic future.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson, who presented on skills at the roundtable this week, said there was agreement on the need for skilled workers, but how to achieve that remains a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about how we break down the barriers. Everybody at the roundtable today could see the benefits of building better systems for workers and what skilled immigration can bring to the table. The challenge is how to operationalise it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What is the economic reform roundtable and what will it achieve?\n\nSkilled migrant 'mismatch'\n\nIn its submission to the roundtable, the Activate Australia's Skills campaign has suggested that a national governance system for all overseas skills and qualifications recognition is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nActivate Australia's Skills is an alliance campaign of businesses, unions, social services and community groups pushing a skills and qualifications recognition policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n620,000 permanent migrants are currently working below their skill level in Australia, according to government figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nDane Moores is the head of strategic relations at Settlement Services International and is also the campaign manager for Activate Australia's Skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News migrants face a range of obstacles to finding employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's what we call the migrant skills mismatch,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of the barriers include a lack of local work experience, limited professional networks and social capital in some cases, language barriers, and in many cases, discrimination in the labour market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said blind resume testing showed applicants with non-Anglo names were 57 per cent less likely to be considered for leadership positions in Australia, despite identical resumes.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Change Agents: Overcoming the employment stumbling block facing many migrants SBS News 08:12 English\n\nMoores said the group has a number of recommendations to improve the skills recognition process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're calling on the government to provide financial support for those migrants who can't afford to go through the system. And secondly, to reduce information barriers by creating an online portal with all the information migrants need to get their skills and qualifications recognised.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation's research has found Australia's economy could grow by $9 billion every year or $25 million a day if the skills of migrants were put to better use.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are currently 39 skilled migration assessing authorities approved to undertake assessments for 650 occupations, according to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Current skill assessment processes are expensive, complex, lack transparency, and prevent migrant workers from having equal employment opportunities,\" the ACTU told SBS News in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thousands of people are being needlessly locked out from filling skills shortages due to barriers unrelated to their skills: excessive fees, bureaucratic red tape, and slow and confusing processes throughout the skills recognition system.\"\n\n\n\nCritical sector hampered by 'red tape'\n\nSectors that rely on engineers to support construction and infrastructure have been a focus of the roundtable.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineers Australia, which does skills recognition for overseas-born engineers, estimates that two-thirds of Australian-born engineers are working directly in engineering roles, compared with half of overseas-born engineers working in engineering roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation says its recent research found some 47 per cent of migrant engineers actively seeking a job in the sector are unemployed.\n\n\n\n\"Engineers Australia welcomes efforts to make skills recognition clearer and more consistent, but it has to be profession-specific. Alongside recognising overseas qualifications, the real challenge is getting national harmony and consistency across states and territories,\" Engineers Australia CEO Romilly Madew told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nMadew added that the government needs to address \"the red tape\" around licensing and registration between different states, to better realise the \"full benefits\" of the engineering workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Skills and Training Minister, Andrew Giles, told SBS News the government is \"already doing critical work\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Programs like Free TAFE have provided the opportunity for hundreds of thousands of people to upskill in areas where we need more workers \u2013 including in housing construction, nursing and aged care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On top of that, our Government\u2019s Advanced Entry Trades Training program will see the skills of 6,000 people recognised.\"\n\n\n\n",

It was an important game for us even though it didn\u2019t go the way we wanted it to, I wanted to play it.\u201d Simpkin, who met Surjan at Clovelly Beach six years ago, said his head was a mess when he ran onto the field.\n\n\u201cI had a good chat to Chez [Daly Cherry-Evans], he was pretty good to me,\u201d Simpkin said. Loading \u201cHe just said I\u2019m not a chance today, just take a second and breathe. When you get out there, obviously there were all the formalities at the start of the game, he was just \u2018take that time, that minute or two to just have a couple of breaths and just clear your mind before the game.\u2019 \u201cThat helped me, I had a couple of moments like that. Everyone was really good, they got me in shape and ready to go pretty quickly, so it was good.\u201d Simpkin said it has been an eye-opening adjustment to footy with fatherhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, just the sleep and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe made me do the first nappy, it is disgusting \u2026I was saying to her if we did this at the start of the year, I would have struggled just with the sleep and adjusting to everything. \u201cHopefully we win all of our games and see what happens, but if that doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019re pretty close to the end of the season, so it\u2019s not too bad anyway.\u201d Graham still in pain but keen to rush field for Johnston\u2019s try milestone Campbell Graham\u2019s back injury has been so painful that the South Sydney centre struggles getting out of chairs and driving long distances. But it won\u2019t stop him being the first one running onto the field when teammate Alex Johnston finally breaks the NRL\u2019s try-scoring record.\n\nJohnston needs four more tries to pass Ken Irvine\u2019s mark of 212 four-pointers, but time is running out for the winger to enter rarefied air this season. The 15th-placed Rabbitohs host St George Illawarra on Thursday night for their penultimate game before facing bitter rivals Sydney Roosters after a bye. Souths officials have publicly urged fans not to storm the field once Johnston finally breaks the record, as supporters did when AFL star Lance Franklin kicked his 1000th goal in 2022. But teammates could be a different matter, with Graham keen to run through his pain and show Johnston some love.\n\nInjured Rabbitohs centre Campbell Graham.

Obviously it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, so we\u2019ll just see how it plays out,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a monkey on his back for a couple of years now. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great achievement, not only in our game but in Australian sport to have a record like that. It really couldn\u2019t happen to a better person.\u201d Seeing his mate break the record would be a rare bright spot in a tough season for Graham, who has been troubled by a bulging disc in his back since March.

Loading \u201cSimple things like driving long distances is not great, getting up out of chairs, stuff like that. It isn\u2019t ideal, day to day,\u201d Graham said of his pain. \u201cIt does get you pretty down, even just day to day, dealing with a chronic issue like that. My focus is just to get on top of this, not only for footy but for myself as well. At the moment, the goal is to be back fit and training by pre-season.\u201d\n\nAnother disrupted year was a tough pill to swallow for Graham, who had been hampered by a sternum injury across the previous two seasons. The sternum issues forced Graham to withdraw from NSW\u2019s squad for the 2023 State of Origin series opener and eventually sidelined him from Souths\u2019 entire 2024 campaign. But Graham is hopeful his luck will turn in 2026, when Souths will fight to recover from a season of injury horror across the board. \u201cThat\u2019s something that helps me in my mindset, that although I\u2019ve had a pretty unlucky run the last couple of years I know things will get better,\u201d he said. \u201cI know if I keep doing the right things, I\u2019ll give myself every chance to be fully fit by pre-season.\u201d AAP Murray lifting training standards as Rabbitohs get their groove back\n\nChristian Nicolussi Cameron Murray has been credited with helping South Sydney win their past two games, simply by returning from injury and lifting the standards at training. The Rabbitohs\u2019 skipper was not named to return from an Achilles injury for Thursday night\u2019s clash against St George Illawarra, while Latrell Mitchell was also left off the team sheet as he continues to battle a nerve issue in his back. The sight of Murray back in full training at Heffron Park has been the circuit-breaker the Bunnies needed, according to injured representative centre Campbell Graham.\n\n\u201cThe way he leads and communicates with the boys out there, you can see training has gone up a gear,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIn all honesty, I think he has helped contribute to our wins the last couple of weeks, just with his presence. \u201cCam is giving himself every opportunity to get back and play. The medical staff aren\u2019t pushing him, but Cam is his own man, and if he feels like he\u2019s ready, he\u2019ll push to play. Souths skipper Cameron Murray Credit: NRL Images \u201cJust seeing someone like that and how dedicated he is to his rehab, how professional he has been about the whole thing \u2013 he hasn\u2019t left any stone unturned \u2013 it\u2019s pretty admirable.\u201d\n\nMurray and Mitchell went down within minutes of each other in the pre-season, with the captain rupturing his Achilles tendon. He wants to play in the last round against the Sydney Roosters if fit, and has the full blessing of coach Wayne Bennett. The easy thing would be to keep Murray on ice and let him be fresh for day one of 2026 pre-season training, but as Bennett said recently, \u201cHe wants to reward himself for nine months of rehab. Even if it\u2019s just a couple of games, it\u2019s a game he loves, and it\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t been able to do.\u201d Mitchell has also had an injury-interrupted year, with the latest back injury forcing him to miss another week. With the bye next week, he is also a chance to return for the Roosters. Campbell Graham helps launch the Telstra Footy Country Round at East Hills on Tuesday. Credit: Kate Geraghty/SMH Bennett acknowledged the role Murray had played by being back at training, but was equally complimentary of Mitchell and Cody Walker, who both played big roles in their returns against the Titans and Eels, respectively.\n\n\u201cCam is a pretty exceptional guy, he\u2019s one of the elite players in the game with his attitude, and everything he does is at 100 per cent,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe appreciate him being back at training, but the wins also come down to having quality players on the field. Cody and Latrell have played the last two weeks; they\u2019ve been really good for us and made a difference.\u201d Meanwhile, Graham, who missed all of last year with a sternum injury, then broke his hand in the off-season, injured his calf in round three, and has not been sighted since round 18, confirmed a back complaint had left him with mental demons. He has avoided surgery and been limited to pilates, swimming and physiotherapy, with the aim of resuming running in the pre-season.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t leave you in a good headspace, especially after the year I had last year, it\u2019s just been very stop-start,\u201d Graham said. \u201cNot feeling at your physical best for such a long time, it gets pretty draining.\u201d In team news, Isaah Yeo has been named on an extended bench for the Panthers when they host Canberra in Mudgee on Friday, Ryan Papenhuyzen (concussion) was listed in jersey No.21 for Friday night\u2019s Storm clash with the Bulldogs, Sydney Roosters winger Daniel Tupou (concussion) is replaced by Junior Tupou for their trip to Parramatta, while Krystian Mapapalangi is the centre named on the Wests Tigers\u2019 extended bench in case Starford To\u2019o (shoulder) is not fit. A summer to relish breaking Irvine\u2019s record sits fine with AJ Alex Johnston hopes to break Ken Irvine\u2019s all-time try-scoring record at the start of next season \u2013 not in the coming weeks \u2013 so he can have all summer to savour the prospect of achieving the historic feat. Johnston failed to add to his career tally against Parramatta on the weekend to remain on 209 tries, three shy of Irvine\u2019s long-standing mark.\n\nThe player marking him on Thursday night, when the Rabbitohs take on St George Illawarra, will be former Rabbitoh Corey Allan, who gave Johnston the easiest try of his career in the final round of 2020. Johnston needed five tries in the final round to finish as that year\u2019s top try-scorer, and Allan got across the line, only to wait for Johnston to catch up to him and give him the ball to score. Allan said he was yet to receive the carton of beer Johnston had promised. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for that case \u2013 it will be interesting to see if it ever rocks up at my doorstep,\u201d Allan said. \u201cI could have scored that night, but I thought I better look behind me to see if he was coming. He needed five to draw level with Kyle Feldt [on the top try-scorers list]. Lo and behold, he was screaming my name, and his eyes lit up when I turned around. The rest is history.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the record will be broken again. \u2018AJ\u2019 is a special player.\u201d Alex Johnston and Corey Allan celebrate that try in 2020. Credit: Getty Images Johnston said of Allan: \u201cHopefully he can help me with a couple of more tries this weekend.\u201d South Sydney coach Wayne Bennett said after the win over the Eels that the likely return of Latrell Mitchell to left centre would help Johnston in his quest to break the record. \u201cI love playing with \u2018T-Mitt\u2019 [Mitchell],\u201d Johnston said. \u201cCody Walker has given me most of my tries, but Trell would be the second most.\n\n\u201cI sort of only want to get three tries this year, that way I\u2019ve got the whole off-season and the lead-up [to] next year to try and get it in round one. A hat-trick this weekend will see Alex Johnston draw level with Ken Irvine\u2019s long-standing try record. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what I should do [to celebrate]. I\u2019ll have to do something.\u201d Souths have asked fans not to storm the playing pitch when Johnston reaches the milestone, but the winger has other ideas. \u201cI think it will happen, and the NRL and Souths will have to be prepared for it to happen,\u201d Johnston said.\n\n\u201cThere were pretty crazy scenes in the AFL when [Sydney Swans forward Lance] Buddy Franklin [kicked 1000 goals], so there will be a lot that goes on behind the scene to make sure it is safe. I\u2019m all for it. I think the NRL will need to prepare for it.\u201d The Bunnies are chasing three straight wins, while the Dragons need three replacements, for Jack de Belin, Hamish Stewart and Hame Sele, who were all ruled out with category-one concussion symptoms on the weekend. Why Haas chose Samoa Dan Walsh Queensland Origin centre Rob Toia will prioritise his Tongan heritage over a potential Ashes tour berth as fellow Kangaroos defector Payne Haas declared Samoa now has the playing stocks to win next year\u2019s World Cup.\n\nHaas confirmed on Sunday his switch of allegiance to the rising Pacific nation, with high hopes that fellow Australian stars Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow do the same for this year\u2019s Pacific Championships. Tonga\u2019s October 26 clash with Samoa at Suncorp Stadium is predicted to draw one of the best Test attendances in decades on Australian soil and outsell the 33,196 who turned out for Australia\u2019s win over the Mate Ma\u2019a in Brisbane last year. Toia\u2019s decision to represent his family\u2019s Tongan roots does, however, take another outside back option off the table for Australia\u2019s three-Test tour of the UK in October and November. Big names Latrell Mitchell and Tom Trbojevic loom as the Kangaroos\u2019 first-choice centre pairing for the first Ashes tour since 2003. However, both have been hampered by injury as South Sydney and Manly have struggled this season, and arguments could be made for them focusing on club commitments given their injury histories.\n\nToia\u2019s rise as a rookie of the year contender and an eye-catching debut Origin series keeping Mitchell quiet had him in Kevin Walters\u2019 sights, particularly given Stephen Crichton (Samoa), Valentine Holmes (torn rotator cuff) and Campbell Graham are unavailable for Australia. Rob Toia has committed to Tonga at the end of the season. Credit: NRL Photos Like Tabuai-Fidow, Brisbane\u2019s Kotoni Staggs is still considering whether he makes himself available for Australia or Tonga at season\u2019s end. Melbourne\u2019s Xavier Coates, Canterbury\u2019s Matt Burton and Jacob Kiraz, Parramatta\u2019s Zac Lomax and Josh Addo-Carr, and Roosters rugby convert Mark Nawaqanitawase loom as Australia\u2019s other leading three-quarter options. Under current international eligibility rules, Toia\u2019s opting to play for Tonga after coach Kristian Woolf got in contact won\u2019t preclude him from representing Australia or New Zealand (where his father was born), just as Haas\u2019s call won\u2019t impact his NSW Origin career.\n\n\u201cWoolfy reached out, and I responded. I was very surprised to be honest, but I told him I\u2019d love the opportunity to play for Tonga if he was to choose me,\u201d Toia said. Payne Haas has confirmed his allegiance switch to Samoa. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI had a chat with my parents about it, telling them that opportunity was there, and they were over the moon. My grandparents on both sides have lived in Tonga the majority of their lives, so they were probably the happiest. They were telling me they can\u2019t wait to see me represent them if that happens.\u201d League Immortal Andrew Johns on Sunday likened Haas\u2019s decision to represent Samoa to Jason Taumalolo\u2019s generational switch to Tonga for the 2017 World Cup. Haas said he was inspired by the North Queensland veteran\u2019s move, though he was reluctant to put public pressure on Fa\u2019asuamaleaui to follow his lead.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we get a few more boys over, but they have to follow their heart and do what\u2019s right for them,\u201d Haas said. \u201cTo play with [Fa\u2019asuamaleaui] would be special. I hope he makes the switch.\u201d Haas said on Sunday that new Australian coach Walters was understanding of his decision, which was first set in motion when he played against Samoa in 2023, and the island\u2019s national anthem played. Haas, Crichton, Jarome Luai, Brian To\u2019o and Terrell May headline an already star-studded Samoan contingent under coach Ben Gardiner, prompting Haas\u2019s prediction of World Cup glory at next year\u2019s tournament. \u201cI feel like we can win it, especially with the team we have got now,\u201d Haas said.",

Fair Work has launched an investigation into the company. One Transport NSW proposal contained in the documents shows the centre of the light rail stop covering Palings Lane, which divides Merivale\u2019s CBD headquarters. But the proposed stop would have blocked access to Merivale\u2019s Ivy restaurant precinct, which houses restaurants Uccello and Felix as well as its VIP club Level 6. The Wynyard light rail stop out the front of Merivale venues. Credit: Edwina Pickles Instead, the light rail stop was constructed further away from Wynyard and closer to Angel Place, allowing Merivale to expand its al fresco dining outside its restaurant Totti\u2019s. Merivale was also able to secure a \u201csuper taxi rank\u201d on Pitt Street to ferry customers away from the Ivy. The company did not respond to requests for comment about its lobbying of Transport for NSW. A spokesperson for Transport for NSW said a wide range of factors were considered during the planning of the major new public transport project, which had an extensive and lengthy design process, involving public consultation and stakeholder feedback.\n\n\u201cTransport considered a variety of locations for the Wynyard Light Rail stop and its design went through a number of iterations throughout the planning process,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFactors taken into consideration included pedestrian safety, crowding, traffic, road interfaces, platform size, positioning in relation to train stations and other key infrastructure, drainage, accessibility and distance to locations and services.\u201d The construction of the light rail was dogged by repeated delays, legal battles and prolonged disruption, leaving smaller businesses struggling to survive with debts of up to $500,000. Emanuel Tzirtzilakis, the owner of a cafe on Devonshire Street in Surry Hills, told a NSW Parliamentary inquiry in 2018 that he had been driven to the \u201cbrink of financial ruin\u201d by the project.\n\nConstance led a $31 million compensation scheme for some businesses, but others have taken their claims to the High Court after the NSW government won an appeal against further compensation in 2023. Constance became closer to Hemmes as the hospitality baron expanded his empire into Narooma in Constance\u2019s electorate of Bega. Hemmes bought the Glasshouse Rocks estate in 2017 and now owns four venues and several expansive waterfront properties. Loading The former transport minister, who declined to comment, was regularly seen at events at the Ivy, including parties hosted by Liberal lobbyist and Hemmes\u2019 political consigliere Michael Photios, who ensured the 52-year-old\u2019s relationships reached the top of the Liberal Party. In January 2022, two days after New Year\u2019s Eve, NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet scheduled a meeting with Hemmes at Constance\u2019s home, a separate set of documents released under freedom of information laws reveals.\n\n\u201c7:30pm Private Drink-Dinner: Premier/Andrew Constance/Justin Hemmes,\u201d the calendar invite from Perrottet shows. \u201cWhere: Andrew Constance Property\u201d. When the trio met up, it was not at Constance\u2019s home in Moruya but Hemmes\u2019 60-hectare mansion in Narooma. The scheduled meeting was never disclosed in the premier\u2019s ministerial diary entries. The rules governing ministerial diary entries do not require ministers to disclose social events but cautions them to make public any \u201csubstantive discussion of issues\u201d that may be considered by the minister. The documents show Hemmes would personally email Perrottet\u2019s office to request meetings, including one to discuss Merivale\u2019s unsolicited proposal for the commercial development of Hunter Street metro station, which went ahead on 14 December 2021 and was disclosed in ministerial diary entries.\n\nBut another titled \u201c6pm catch up. Justin Hemmes\u201d on September 15, 2022 at his restaurant Felix, was not disclosed. The former premier declined to comment. In his previous role as state treasurer, Perrottet became a key supporter of ending the lockout laws that had dented Hemmes\u2019 hospitality empire and put restrictions on the wider industry. Perrottet appointed the billionaire to his Treasury advisory council in 2018. As premier, Perrottet described him as a \u201cpub doyen\u201d in 2021 and lauded him for his plans to revitalise the CBD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Perrottet and Hemmes unsuccessfully lobbied then federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, one of Hemmes\u2019 close friends, for an extension of JobKeeper and pushed for a repeal of the fringe benefits tax to encourage corporate long lunches. Perrottet arrives at the Ivy in August 2024 with his wife Helen. Credit: Wolter Peeters After Constance resigned as transport minister and triggered a by-election in Bega in 2022, a briefing from Perrottet\u2019s office spruiked Hemmes\u2019 establishments in Narooma during a campaign stop to highlight a $4 million upgrade to Narooma wharf, which helps service Merivale venues and other restaurants in the southern inlet.\n\nWhen Perrottet resigned as premier in 2023, he had a three-hour lunch at Hemmes\u2019 restaurant Felix. A year later, when he left state parliament, the Ivy and the penthouse that is home to the infamous private members club, Level 6, hosted Perrottet\u2019s farewell. Merivale paid for the former premier\u2019s send-off. The gift did not need to be disclosed because Perrottet left parliament that day. Ministerial diaries show the former state Liberal government had 20 meetings with Merivale between 2019 and 2023, involving the premier, police minister, transport minister, and treasurer. NSW Labor Premier Chris Minns has had two meetings with Merivale since being elected in 2023. Hemmes and his companies have donated more than $350,000 to the Liberal Party since 2018, Australian Electoral Commission records show, while hosting fundraisers with prime ministers at his mansion, the Hermitage, now estimated to be worth $200 million, as part of his decade-long campaign for greater political influence. Internal messages show the company has also targeted men with political capital, including former chiefs of staff in the state government, for special treatment by offering them complimentary Level 6 memberships.\n\nLoading In 2021, Merivale secured one of the biggest government catering contracts in the state: a six-year multimillion-dollar deal under a competitive tender by the Liberal government run by Venues NSW to provide food and drinks at two of Sydney\u2019s largest stadiums, the SCG and Allianz. The state Labor government has put the company on notice, signalling that any plans to renew the contract are under threat following the allegations of exploitation, harassment and underpayment revealed by this masthead. \u201cWe should make sure that we do everything we can to keep workers safe, particularly young women workers who are vulnerable to exploitation in these circumstances,\u201d NSW Legislative Council member Dr Sarah Kaine, the government\u2019s procurement inquiry chair, said in July. The company is also in a $124 million dispute with the state government over the compulsory acquisition of two properties it bought opposite Wynyard Station for $77 million in 2018, which it had planned to turn into \u201cIvy 2.0\u201d as part of its $3 billion property empire.",

All are now headed by women: Annette Pitman leads Museums of History of NSW; Dr Caroline Butler-Bowdon, the State Library of NSW; Kim McKay, the Australian Museum; Louise Herron, the Sydney Opera House; and Lisa Havilah, the Powerhouse Museum. Last year, their cultural institutions welcomed more than eight million visitors, commanded operational budgets of more than $600 million and employed 2200 full-time staff. They lead in the tricky aftermath of COVID, which temporarily shut their doors, reshaped public buying habits globally and played havoc with the costs of doing business. Audiences are changing, at once more informed, and increasingly sophisticated but also weaned on novelty; time poor and distracted.

Credit: Wolter Peeters Their museums and galleries are under pressure to leverage technology and enhance visitor experience, without turning their halls into places of entertainment, or quasi-wedding venues. Many occupy heritage sites built at the high watermark of the British Empire, their collections over-represented when it comes to the works, perspectives and deeds of white men, and all the while their budgets are under pressure, as they seek new funding streams that can bring ethical dilemmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpectrum sat down with the leaders in the boardroom of the Australian Museum to talk budgets, philanthropy and future directions. Annette Pitman, you lead Museums of History of NSW, but before that, you were chief executive of Create NSW, and you have had the benefit of sitting in on countless budget meetings. Can you set the scene: What is the reality of the financial climate that the state\u2019s major galleries and museums currently find themselves in? Annette Pitman: I think we are in a period of unprecedented demand for what we do. The pandemic really made people appreciate what cultural institutions provide and appreciate the gathering that happens around culture in these spaces. We are incredibly nimble at doing really cutting-edge and meaningful things with small budgets. So we are in a period where we\u2019ll have to be at our most creative. Kim McKay with a favourite object from the Australian Museum collection: a Pormpuraaw Ghost Net sculpture, made from discarded plastic commercial fishing nets, lines and traps. Ghost nets drift in the ocean and create a deadly hazard for marine life before washing up on beaches. In the late 1980s, McKay co-founded Clean Up Australia and saw first-hand the devastation ghost nets cause. Credit: Wolter Peeters Are cultural institutions out of the woods post-pandemic, Louise Herron? Louise Herron: Our audience statistics suggest many of the worst of the COVID impacts are behind us. Even in the current cost-of-living crisis, people will still save up and go to see the performers they love. Since COVID, we have become more intentional and analytical about what we do. People got out of the habit of going out, so we need to be even more conscious of who we are trying to attract \u2013 be that children, Pasifika people, contemporary music fans. We keep working to let people know we do a lot more than opera, though opera still accounts for a bit more than 10 per cent of tickets sold. Kim McKay: The fact that we are free for all to come into and enjoy the museum (yes, you pay for special exhibitions and programming) is especially important in a cost-of-living crisis and tight budgets. It\u2019s a way to level the playing field. I see migrant families, three generations in the one family coming in together because all people want their kids to be exposed to knowledge and learning. The Australian Museum brings in one and a half million people a year but imagine if we could reach 10 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Holy Grail for cultural institutions is the 18 to 30-year-olds. How does the Art Gallery of NSW engage with these young adults? Maud Page: Our youth engagement strategy begins in early childhood. [We] do that through artist-led children\u2019s programming, like Hive Festival, which attracted more than 28,000 visitors over one weekend in January. If you bring in children, you bring in their aunties, their cousins, their grandparents and their parents and you provide an experience that resonates with all ages. The magic has to come from education, but people don\u2019t want to be dictated to any more. They want to be enthralled. So in our case, it is all about stepping into experimental music like Grammy Award-winning artist Solange in 2023 and ARIA award-winning Northern Territory rock band King Stingray, who last month attracted more than 6000 visitors to the Art Gallery in one night. Maud Page holds an Aurukun fire stick gifted to her from artist. \u201cIt took me a long time to fall pregnant. The fabulous artist Tony Albert had begun at Queensland Art Gallery in the same week as me. After three years working together, in 2005, my daughter Alia was born. Sharing in my exultation, Tony gave me a rare Aurukun fire stick made by Joe Ngallametta. Joe passed away not long after and this beautiful object represented birth and death but also the beginning of a learning journey into the extraordinary world of First Nations art. Credit: Wolter Peeters And yet, your gallery has been accused in the Murdoch press of being too woke. Maud Page: It is a very reductive description of what we do, and I would say every single institution around this table is open and generous and welcoming to everyone. The art gallery showcases such a broad spectrum of artistic voices and contemporary and historical art that offers an enriching experience for all visitors. Writing and reading are somewhat old-fashioned ideas in the internet age, Caroline Butler-Bowdon. How does the state\u2019s oldest library survive? Caroline Butler-Bowdon: Books and stories are just as relevant today and remain at the heart of libraries. But libraries have always evolved, and today they\u2019re also places for creativity, lifelong learning and social connection. People used to go to cathedrals and other sorts of places for a sense of connection but these days they are coming to our institutions for the same experience. We work with the Sydney Writers\u2019 Festival, Sydney Film Festival, Mardi Gras and it\u2019s through partnerships and collaboration that we build audiences, we diversify our audiences. We\u2019ve had a 25 per cent growth in visitation in one year. The core ingredients are essential services, magical experiences and everything in between using social media to share stories, to share our research and depth and drive audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouise Herron: You definitely need to have a clear ambition and ours is to be Everyone\u2019s House. Last night, one of Australia\u2019s heaviest metal bands, Parkway Drive, played to a sold-out Concert Hall of 2500 people, backed by a full symphony orchestra. Almost 80 per cent of the audience was new to the Opera House. Some people were so disappointed to miss out on tickets that they came anyway and stood on the Forecourt during the concert, many in black tie. We\u2019re looking for artists or genres that will bring new audiences to the Opera House. And if one of our organisations connects with a new community, it helps all of us. Annette Pitman holds Laminex samples circa 1956. \u201cThis post-war period marked a series of shifts in Australian society; housing boom, Australian Dream, kitchen becoming the heart of the home. Laminex was produced in hundreds of colours and patterns; something for every home, and as a result this durable, practical and affordable Australian made product became ubiquitous in our homes.\u201d Credit: Wolter Peeters Lisa Havilah, you are building a cultural institution from scratch on the banks of the Parramatta River. If you build it, will the crowds come? Lisa Havilah: One of the reasons the museum at Parramatta is designed to be so vertical is to give as much green space as is possible back to the community and wrapping around each of the exhibition spaces with public space that will lead to an open rooftop. It\u2019s in the mix of public space, exhibition space, amenity and experience that we hope to make the museum a part of somebody\u2019s everyday life. We are creating exhibitions that people can immerse themselves in in new ways, like working with architects, presenting the collection in new ways that engage young audiences. Because you might come to an exhibition, you might come to have dinner, you might come to just sit in the garden or you might come with your family to sit on the riverbank. Loading So, why do you say the traditional show-and-tell model of programming is on the way out? Lisa Havilah: Museums need to change and move more than they used to. Exhibitions need to change. Stories need to shift and become more relevant. Historically, museum exhibitions have been very didactic, presenting one position on an object or one story. So it\u2019s about giving space for people\u2019s perspectives, their own histories and memories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim McKay: In our early years, our institutions didn\u2019t engage with First Nations people. It\u2019s very different now. Why should we speak for First Nations people when they can speak for themselves? Museums of History of NSW cares for 12 house museums, and a written archive that dates to 1788, the arrival of the First Fleet. Annette Pitman, how do you avoid romanticising the past, and how do you represent an Australia that has changed since the foundational times of those house museums? Loading Annette Pitman: History is messy, right? It\u2019s a multidimensional thing and no matter what topic we might be talking about, with the hindsight of time, we come to understand it differently. I think the public understands this, especially today when we see so much manipulation of the truth. There is value to be found in the information we hold about our past. We\u2019re partnering with the Aboriginal Languages Trust on a wonderful program that supports First Nations teams to go through our archives and identify references to culture and language that aren\u2019t known. So there are ways we can engage without sugar-coating what\u2019s happened and that\u2019s our duty as a public institution. Museums and galleries pitch themselves as places of public trust at a time of misinformation, but do you run the danger of turning culture into a commodity? Annette Pitman: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with making quality content entertaining. We just had a kids program called Beautiful waterways, Stinky Sewers that drew 7000 kids from all over NSW who came to the Tank Stream and learn the history of public sanitation. I think we\u2019re clever enough to navigate that line. Caroline Butler-Bowdon with Dorothea Mackellar\u2019s 1907-1908 poetry notebook from the library\u2019s collection, the only known manuscript of her iconic poem Core of My Heart, later renamed My Country. \u201cThe poem is still loved today for its enduring themes, and shows just how powerfully words can spark creativity, stir emotion, and stay meaningful across generations. The same can be said for libraries. What I love is that it was first written when Dorothea was just 19 years old. Our reading rooms are full of young people, studying and creating and it\u2019s nice to think that a future Dorothea indeed could be one of them.\u201d Credit: Wolter Peeters\n\nAdvertisement",

I need to feel the love to be physical. I need a good night\u2019s sleep and a bit of quiet, then I might be in the mood. We\u2019ve worked hard at our relationship and I\u2019m embarrassed to wonder, \u201cOh, my god, after everything, are we going to lose each other through the chaos of parenthood?\u201d\n\nWe met as reporters on Sunday Night at Channel 7 in 2013. There was an attraction, but I mostly loved how hard he worked. Maybe it\u2019s an in-built evolutionary thing: he\u2019s going to be hunting for me forever. I could see he was a solid person \u2013 stable, honest \u2013 but I\u2019d been \u00admarried before and I was wary; I carried a huge amount of shame.\n\nAfter a couple of years, Tim decided we needed to explain our relationship to my parents; the next minute, we\u2019re in a car with them. Tim said, \u201cPull over at the nearest pub, Mr and Mrs Madam, we need to talk to you. I want to be with your daughter forever.\u201d It went so well that now I think they favour him over me!

Other gold stocks also gained. Evolution Mining was up 1.8 per cent and Newmont rose 1.3 per cent.\n\nA flurry of local company results took investor attention away from Wall Street, where indexes ended mixed as the sell-down of AI superstars such as Nvidia continued, albeit at a more muted pace.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 climbed 65.90 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 8983.90 as of 11.05am AEST, with nine of its 11 industry sectors in the green, led by industrials, mining and consumer stocks. The ASX added 0.3 per cent on Wednesday. The Australian dollar was 0.3 per cent lower at US64.34\u00a2.\n\nThe Australian sharemarket opened stronger this morning, putting it on track for a new record on one of the busiest days of reporting season.\n\nMining giants BHP, Fortescue Metals and Rio Tinto also advanced, rising 1.2 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. So did the big four banks, with CBA up 0.1 per cent, Westpac rising 0.7 per cent, NAB up 0.2 per cent and ANZ Bank up 0.5 per cent, respectively. Mining and financial stocks make up more than half of the ASX, so even small movements can steer the wider market.\n\nBrambles shares climbed 5.2 per cent. The pallet supplier this morning announced a share buyback of up to $US400 million ($622.5 million) and declared a final dividend of US20.83\u00a2 a share, taking its payout for the year to US39.83\u00a2, up 17 per cent from the last year, as an efficiency drive helped it improve profits.\n\nOn the flip side, Whitehaven Coal shed 2.3 per cent after reporting its underlying net profit fell by more than half to $319 million in the past financial year, with earnings markedly slowing in the second half as coal prices declined. The news came a day after Yancoal, the nation\u2019s biggest pure play coal producer, said its revenues fell in the June half despite a higher coal output because of weaker prices. Yancoal\u2019s shares added 0.4 per cent after their 11.4 per cent loss on Wednesday.\n\nAnd James Hardie\u2019s horror sell-down continued, with the share price falling another 8.2 per cent after plummeting 27.8 per cent on Wednesday after the home cladding maker said its full-year net income was down 60 per cent as sales in its key US market declined. Demand in home repairs, renovations and new construction is \u201cchallenging\u201d, it warned.\n\nSuper Retail Group, which owns the Rebel sports, Supercheap Auto and Macpac chains, jumped 13.9 per cent. They hit a record high after the company said it boosted sales by 4.5 per cent to a record $4.1 billion in the past financial year, with growth accelerating in the second half.",

Picture: NewsWire / Nikki Short\n\nBruce Lehrmann has sensationally claimed that Lisa Wilkinson and The Project did not name the former Liberal staffer because they were trying to drive up ratings, not because they were acting reasonably.\n\nLehrmann has appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court following his multimillion dollar defamation suit loss to Ten and Wilkinson last year.\n\nJustice Michael Lee found that Lehrmann \u2013 on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities \u2013 had raped his colleague Brittany Higgins inside Parliament House in 2019.\n\nLehrmann sued over Ms Wilkinson\u2019s interview with Ms Higgins on The Project but Justice Lee made damning findings against him and he was subsequently ordered to pay $2m in Ten\u2019s legal costs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe former Liberal staffer has now appealed Justice Lee\u2019s decision and is being represented by solicitor Zali Burrows at a three-day hearing.\n\nTen is being represented by Dr Matt Collins SC while barrister Sue Chrysanthou SC is appearing for Ms Wilkinson.\n\nBruce Lehrmann leaves the Federal Court on Wednesday.

Picture: NCA NewsWire / John Appleyard\n\n\u2018Denial of natural justice\u2019\n\nMs Burrows told the court on Wednesday that Lehrmann was the victim of procedural unfairness because the findings of Justice Lee were different to the case put forward at trial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really, serious unfair denial of natural justice if Mr Lehrmann goes through a trial where it\u2019s said \u2018you are accused of A, B, D, E to Ms Higgins, this is the way it happened. And the judge finds \u2018well I don\u2019t find any of those A, B, C, D, E\u2019,\u201d Ms Burrows said.\n\nHowever Justice Michael Wigney replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. He did a find \u2026 it was A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I \u2026 A number of the matters alleged and particularised were found.\u201d\n\nMs Burrows further argued that it was pleaded by Ten and Wilkinson as a \u201cviolent rape\u201d but Justice Lee found it was a \u201cnon-violent rape\u201d.\n\nJustice Craig Colvin replied: \u201cI\u2019m not sure he found a non-violent rape and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a concept that I understand.\u201d\n\nMs Burrows told the court that Lehrmann was \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d that Justice Lee made findings that differed from Ms Higgins\u2019 account and \u201che came up with a different version, a softer version.\u201d\n\nBruce Lehrmann was branded Australia\u2019s most hated man by his solicitor. Picture: NewsWire / John Appleyard\n\n\u2018Australia\u2019s most hated man\u2019\n\nIn his judgment, Justice Lee found that Lehrmann could have only been awarded $20,000 had he won the trial.\n\nHowever Ms Burrows said he should be awarded a substantial amount if he had the findings overturned on appeal.\n\nShe has pointed to media coverage of the trial, \u201csocial media insults he gets\u201d and other \u201charassment\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty much become the national joke,\u201d Ms Burrows said.\n\n\u201cAs I previously submitted to this court, he\u2019s probably Australia\u2019s most hated man.\u201d\n\nBarrister Sue Chrysanthou and Lisa Wilkinson.

Picture: NewsWire / Simon Bullard.\n\nHe claimed the government was adding \u201csignificantly increased amounts of staff\u201d and bed expansions \u201cto the tune of $120m\u201d at Blacktown Hospital and said his government was committed to focusing on \u201cpatient experience\u201d at problem hospitals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant improvements at Blacktown Hospital but there is more to do,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Park also defended the government\u2019s interim offer of a 5 per cent increase to the 15 per cent night duty penalties for nurses and midwives.\n\nThe government has previously come under fire for the gap in pay between NSW healthcare workers and workers in other states around the country.\n\n\u201cDo you expect this to address recruitment issues when for example in WA nurses have a night duty of 35 per cent, in Tasmania 27.5 per cent, in the Northern Territory 25 per cent and in the ACT 25 per cent,\u201d Ms Cohn asked.\n\nMr Park said neither he nor the Premier Chris Minns were \u201cdoing a lap of honour\u201d about the interim offer, instead suggesting the offer was a quick way to practically increase nurses pay.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is after a decade of wage suppression brought about the Coalition government \u2026 there are discrepancies in pay for healthcare workers in NSW and other jurisdictions,\u201d he said.",
