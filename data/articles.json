And what happens if it bursts?\n\nIf you believe the valuations, the company behind ChatGPT is now worth more than what the entire state of Victoria produces in a year, and it's not far off NSW. (AP)\n\nThe Bank of England warned of an increasing risk of \"a sharp market correction\", Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said \"a lot of capital\" wouldn't deliver returns and the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said after surging valuations and booming investments, \"markets could reprice sharply\".\n\nUsing simpler words, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos called it \"kind of an industrial bubble\".\n\nEven Sam Altman, the head of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, asked directly if investors were \"overexcited about AI\", flat out said \"yes\".\n\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" he told reporters at The Verge and some other tech publications in August.\n\n\"If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.\"\n\nEven Sam Altman, the head of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, asked directly if investors were \"overexcited about AI\", flat out said \"yes\". (AP)\n\nWhat even is a bubble?\n\nSo, are they right? And what happens if the AI bubble bursts?\n\nStanford Graduate School of Business Professor Anat Admati says the concept of a bubble is not well defined, and it's almost impossible to identify one in real time.\n\n\"Stock valuation and timing stocks is very difficult because the stock reflects the entire future and all lots and lots of factors,\" she tells 9news.com.au.\n\n\"So the notion that you're diagnosing a bubble as it's happening is often folly.\n\n\"People form beliefs and decide to trade, and it's a very dangerous game to play for investors, for pundits, journalists like yourself.\"\n\nThe OpenAI logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying output from ChatGPT. (AP)\n\nOxford Economics lead economist Adam Slater sees \"some symptoms of a bubble\", including rapid growth in tech stock prices and the fact tech stocks now comprise about 40 per cent of the S&P 500 stock market tracking the 500 leading US companies.\n\nHe also points to market valuations that appear \"stretched\" beyond their worth and \"a general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield\".\n\nSome analysts suggest AI could lead to productivity gains not seen since Europe after World War II, while Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu has predicted a 0.7 per cent gain in US productivity over a decade.\n\n\"You've got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\" Slater says.\n\n\"Nobody really knows where it's going to land.\"\n\nOpenAI isn't the only player in the AI game. (Getty)\n\nIs this the dotcom boom 2.0?\n\nThe easy comparison, which even Altman and his Open AI chairman, Bret Taylor, have made, is with the dotcom boom, when the tech-heavy NASDAQ surged almost 600 per cent in the mid-to-late '90s before wiping off almost all of those games in about a year and a half.\n\nA swathe of start-ups were wiped out and even big hitters still around today such as Microsoft, Oracle and Intel took a battering on the markets.\n\nAdmati says it's too hard to predict whether a potential AI bubble bursting would do anything more than correcting the price of some companies, much less when it might happen.\n\nA swathe of start-ups were wiped out and even big hitters still around today such as Microsoft, Oracle and Intel took a battering on the markets. (AP)\n\n\"The internet bubble burst didn't change the entire world economy,\" she says.\n\n\"It was a price correction in a relatively narrow sector.\"\n\nTaylor puts a positive on the comparison, saying you could argue people pouring money into internet stocks in 1999 were broadly right.\n\n\"If you look at the internet bubble, a lot of people think about the flops, like Pets.com and Webvan,\" he tells The Verge.\n\n\"Through the lens of the past 30 years, though, we've now gotten most of the largest companies in the world, including Amazon and Google, two of the largest companies in the world.\"\n\nTaylor argues people pouring money into internet stocks in 1999 were broadly right. (AP Photo/Richard Drew FILE)\n\n'It's the fear of missing out'\n\nOpenAI is the most striking example of AI investment because it's come from nothing to be one of the world's most hyped companies in a few years based solely on the promise of its tech.\n\nIt is now valued at roughly $US500 billion ($771.9 billion), not too far below the GDP of Austria ($804.1 billion) or the 2023-24 GSP (gross state product) of NSW ($821 billion).\n\nBut the big boys are also shovelling money into their large language models and other AI research.\n\nGoogle is all-in on AI across its phones and even search and just this week announced another $US15 billion investment in an AI data hub, Amazon looks set to spend $US100 billion ($154.5 billion) on the technology this year, Apple boss Tim Cook told employees the AI revolution was \"as big or bigger\" as the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and apps.\n\nGoogle's Gemini AI assistant. (Google)\n\nChipmaker NVIDIA's surge to become the biggest company in the world by market capitalisation \u2013 overtaking even Apple \u2013 was so dramatic that it spurred a wave of articles about how the name is pronounced (en-VID-eeyah, by the way).\n\nIt was driven by a ravenous demand for the company's high-end GPUs, prized above all else in battle for the massive amounts of computing power it takes to sustain these huge companies' AI computing demands.\n\nSo when it invested $US100 billion in OpenAI, which, as well as being one of its main customers, has a 10 per cent stake in chip rival AMD, eyebrows were raised at this \"circular\" financing.\n\nAMD and OpenAI have agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal. (AP)\n\n\"A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Google, and a few others is reported almost daily,\" Yale School of Management leadership expert Professor Jeffrey A Sonnenfeld and senior research fellow Stephen Henriques wrote in an opinion piece called This is how the AI bubble bursts.\n\n\"Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis.\"\n\nHenriques tells 9news.com.au the risks are likely closer to those of the dotcom boom, where there is promise that \"will take a lot longer to materialise than people expect\".\n\n\"It's the fear of missing out,\" Sonnenfeld says.\n\n\"Everybody you know thinks that the costs of missing it are too high, enterprise wise and career wise, to look like you're an anachronism.\"\n\nMicrosoft is a major investor in OpenAI. (AP)\n\nIn their article, the researchers point out that in less than three years, OpenAI has \"gone from a parlour game to a pillar of the global economy\".\n\n\"After pillar, you wonder if you're going to wind up with a pile of rubble, and how to then rebuild out of the shakeout, where you see a lot of damage and carnage done,\" Sonnenfeld tells 9news.com.au.\n\nThe upside\n\nBezos argues the AI boom will be good for the world even if the bubble bursts, describing it as industrial, rather than financial or banking.\n\n\"The ones that are industrial are not nearly as bad. It could even be good because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions,\" Bezos said at a recent tech conference in Italy.\n\nHe compared it to a previous biotech bubble in the 1990s that resulted in new life-saving drugs.\n\n\"Every company gets funded, the good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement distinguishing between the good and bad ideas and so that's also probably happening today,\" he said.\n\nAltman last month predicted people would \"make some dumb capital allocations\", resulting in short-term ups and downs.\n\nBut he was confident it would drive \"a new wave of unprecedented economic growth\", scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and \"new ways to express creativity\".\n\nThe information provided on this website is general in nature only and does not constitute personal financial advice.

        "text": "A critical minerals deal will \"no doubt\" be part of discussions between Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump next week, the treasurer has confirmed.\n\nSpeaking from Washington, where he is meeting American counterparts ahead of the prime minister's official visit next week, Jim Chalmers said Australia could be a \"reliable partner\" of the valuable commodities as the US seeks alternative buyers in a market dominated by China.\n\n\"We know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,\" he said.\n\n\"This will be an important part of the discussions that I have \u2026 and no doubt it will be part of the discussions that Prime Minister Albanese has with President Trump next week.\"\n\nJim Chalmers travelled to the United States for talks ahead of the prime minister's arrival. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nThe cluster of prized metals, which Australia has in abundance but does not yet sell at scale, have long been speculated as an enticing offering for a president who takes an unapologetically transactional approach to diplomacy.\n\nLast week, trade minister Don Farrell said his US counterpart had raised the issue with him and that a deal would be struck \"one of these days\", suggesting it would involve some sort of US investment to help make Australian mining operations viable, in exchange for some form of guaranteed US access to what was extracted.\n\nThe issue has gained further prominence in recent weeks after Chinese threats to use its dominance to control the supply of the minerals, which are important for renewable technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe US also requires the minerals for most of its weapons.\n\nEarlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called China's move \"an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world\" and a step towards \"decoupling\" between China and the west.\n\nAs China flexes dominance on rare earths, Australia sees an opening Trump may have expressed \"shock\", but his administration is clearly not surprised at China's willingness to flex its dominance on rare earths.\n\nMr Bessent vowed to speak with allies, including Australia, on \"a fulsome group response\".\n\n\"China cannot manage the supply chain or the manufacturing process for the rest of the world,\" he told US network CNBC.\n\nMr Chalmers said Australia's interests were \"best served by more trade, not by more trade barriers\".\n\n\"We will engage with our partners to make sure that we can be a very reliable supplier to meet the critical minerals needs of this country, here in the US and other markets around the world,\" he said.\n\nHe said Australia was concerned that the market for critical minerals was not as reliable and robust as it could be when it came to the supply chains.\n\n\"Australia's got a lot to offer to the world,\" he said.\n\nSubsidising a new mining boom\n\nTo grow the domestic industry, the Australian government has been considering subsidising the production and sale of critical minerals operations to give would-be mining investors the confidence they would otherwise lack.\n\nOn the production side, it already offers a variety of tax credits and cash injections under the banner of its industry support regime Future Made in Australia, which has a particular emphasis on \"green\" applications for the metals.\n\nOn the sale side, it has pledged $1.2 billion for a \"strategic reserve\" of the minerals, slated for next year but still in its design phase.\n\nUS wants Australia's rare earths As rare earths re-emerge as a central battleground in the US-China trade war, Australian companies are already striking deals to supply America.\n\nThough this may include a physical stockpile, it is more likely to be an assurance that miners will receive a minimum price for what they can produce.\n\nMiners could then strike future purchase agreements with buyers, backed by the comfort that the government would make good on the minimum price if market conditions were unfavourable.\n\nThe government's involvement may take the form of a financial derivative, a \"paper promise\" to make up any price shortfall, but where the government would itself profit if the price was higher than expected.\n\nWhile the idea of price security was that it would create the space for Australian miners to enter into voluntary and profitable deals with foreign buyers, the government intended to partner with its allies to guide that process along.\n\nThis is where the US could come in, perhaps agreeing to invest in mining operations in exchange for some sort of preferential access to what those operations produce. Similar discussions are already underway with Japan, South Korea, and Europe.\n\nChina's threats to exert greater control over not just the export and refinement of minerals, but also their applications, has catapulted the issue to front of mind for the US government, which has begun stockpiling minerals with defence applications.\n\nWhile it has a variety of options for a variety of minerals, including Canada and South America, Australia's reserves have been raised through official channels and have been linked to securing Australian exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs.",

(Supplied: SafeWork SA)\n\nInstead, he said after the playground was installed in 2012 \"daily and quarterly visual inspections were recorded on only five occasions between April 2018 and January 2021\".\n\n\"There is no evidence the critical load bearing moving parts of the swing were ever inspected on these occasions.\"\n\nHe said testing later revealed there was no manufacturing defect in the worn bolt.\n\nThe ruling notes the teenager was \"thrown\" from the swing when the bolt failed and landed on his head, suffering injuries to his face, forehead eyes and nose.\n\nThe 16-year-old was initially treated at the Port Augusta Hospital before being flown to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for surgery.\n\nMr Lieschke said the boy's father provided a victim impact statement to the tribunal and described his son's injuries as \"horrific\", with his scars \"a constant reminder of the incident\".\n\nHe said a department representative told the tribunal the playground was immediately fenced off and later decommissioned, before a new one costing about $290,000 was installed.\n\n\"The seriousness is aggravated by the defendant placing a particularly vulnerable group of disabled children at risk of serious injury over a long period,\" the deputy president said.\n\nThe tribunal found the Department for Education did not have a system for ensuring all of its playgrounds were inspected as required. (Supplied: SA Government website)\n\nAccording to the ruling, at the time of the incident \"only 360\" of the department's playgrounds \"were then being inspected as required\".\n\nMr Lieschke said the responsibility for playground equipment inspections was delegated to school principals \"without conveying this expectation\" or ensuring they occurred.\n\n\"The defendant had no system of reviewing, checking or auditing to ensure that all playgrounds were included in its centrally controlled inspection and maintenance program,\" he said.\n\n\" The department's existing safety policy for ensuring the inspection and maintenance of potentially dangerous playground equipment was little more than aspirational. \"\n\nHe said the department's \"considered refusal\" to pay the student compensation was \"a poor response to its criminal conduct\".\n\nHe noted an agreement for compensation was later reached, but said the department had \"demonstrated very little regard for its victim's welfare, and thereby, a lack of contrition\".\n\nThe department, who had pleaded guilty to breaching its safety, was convicted and fined $225,000.",

Au revoir, Arnie! And just like that we're done! Best of luck to Ariarne Titmus on her next chapter. After hearing her speak, there is no question in my mind that she's made the right call. Good on her. Thank you all for following along! Some tears to end the press conference Titmus is asked about whether it is \"lovely\" to be entering the next chapter of her life, and starts saying she is \"very happy\" in her personal live and begins to fight back tears. Surprised by interest in retirement news Titmus is so incredibly humble. She says she was taken aback by the reaction and interest in her retirement. \"I couldn't believe how quickly it became news and I don't know, [I was] so overwhelmed with how many messages I have had,\" she says. Show more\n\nTitmus said she was not \"nervous or scared\" to tell her coach Dean Boxall about her plans to retire.\n\n\"I was half expecting him [Boxall] to try and twist my leg to bring me back, and that probably would have been selfish for his part because obviously he did not want me to stop, our partnership has been so fun but he was the opposite,\" she said.\n\n\"He was so happy for me and proud of me and could see that I had so much to look forward to in my life and was happy to support me.\"\n\nTitmus described her retirement as \"a big weight off my shoulders\" and remained defiant about her decision, saying people \"should not question whether I made the right decision or not\".\n\nTitmus said long-time American rival Katie Ledecky (left) was one of the first people to congratulate her on her retirement. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\n\"At the end of the day, it is a decision about my life and I have to do what makes me happy,\" she said.\n\n\"People can have their own thoughts on those things but I know I am content with this.\n\n\" I don't think you realise how difficult it is until you remove yourself from the environment and it is hard going into Olympic Games as favourite and rising to the challenge and defending your title. \"\n\nShe described US rival Katie Ledecky as her \"Goliath\", revealing the American had been one of the first people to congratulate her on her career.\n\n\"I feel really proud of that relationship we have because it goes to show you can leave everything in the pool and still be a good person when you are not racing, so I hope I have left that legacy as well,\" she said.\n\nTitmus said she plans to pursue a career in broadcasting in swimming and other sports, embracing the chance to \"do things that I have never done before\". She hopes to be a part of the broadcast at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.",

(Reuters: Jack Taylor)\n\n\"It sort of brings us into tears and sadness, but happiness as well,\" Sammy Wilson said via interpreter and fellow traditional owner Harry Wilson.\n\nThey were among a group of nine Anangu who swapped the red dirt of the outback for the marble floors of Australia House for the commemoration.\n\nNine Anangu commemorated the anniversary alongside the king.

(Reuters: Stefica Bikes)\n\nNine years later the Hawke government handed back the title deeds for the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.\n\nHundreds gathered to watch the ceremony in front of Uluru.\n\n\"For all Aboriginal people right around Australia, a very important day,\" the event's emcee told the cheering crowd.\n\nBut not everyone was so enthusiastic.\n\nKing Charles met with Uluru-Kata Tjuta's traditional owners, who hope there might be another royal visit to Australia on the cards.

And he said, 'I will come back.' And now he's coming back, I reckon.\"\n\nPrincess Catherine and Prince William visited Uluru in 2014. (Reuters: Phil Noble)\n\nThe comments come amid growing rumours of a royal tour of Australia.\n\n\"That would be a matter for the palace and a matter for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet,\" Mr Smith said with a smile.\n\nIn the meantime, the Anangu will return home for the anniversary, where the prime minister will join them for celebrations on country.",

(Supplied: IPART)\n\nOne of the key recommendations was that electricity companies that breached their licences should be forced to compensate affected customers.\n\nIPART is yet to determine if the actions of Transgrid warranted a breach.\n\nMember Jonathon Coppel said their investigation had been \"complex and quite technical\", but at the same time it was \"well-progressed\".\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the AER said its own investigation into whether Transgrid breached the National Electricity Rules would be concluded in the coming months.\n\nCommunities need more than nice words\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), the outage was caused by two supercell thunderstorms, and possibly a tornado.\n\nBut without direct evidence from radar or damage reports, it was hard to know for sure, as well as the likelihood of a similar damaging weather event happening again in the future.\n\nBroken Hill Mayor Tom Kennedy said he was comfortable things were moving in the right direction to ensure a similar aftermath was avoided, but there was a lot to do.\n\n\"Some of the findings and some of the things that will come out of the inquiries will easily transfer to everywhere in the country and make it a lot better for the whole of NSW and the country,\" he said.",

        "text": "A Queensland mining union says an $80,000 fine handed to an international mining company this week is not enough of a deterrent for companies to avoid putting workers in unsafe situations.\n\nInternational mining giant Coronado Global Resources, through its subsidiary Coronado Curragh, was fined $80,000, plus court costs of $28,572.78, in Rockhampton Magistrates Court on Wednesday over the death of a worker in November 2021.\n\nNo conviction was recorded.\n\nThe fine was for breaching health and safety obligations under the Coal Mining and Safety Act 1999 after experienced worker Clark Peadon, 54, died on site at the Curragh North open-cut mine, north of Blackwater.\n\nThe company was charged three years after the incident, with the maximum penalty under the Act $689,250.\n\nMitch Hughes described the fine as appalling for the loss of someone's life. (ABC Tropical North: Abbey Halter)\n\nMining and Energy Union Queensland district president Mitch Hughes said while he understood the courts were limited by the penalties they could issue, the fine was not enough.\n\n\"To sit here and see that they've only been given an $80,000 fine for someone's life is pretty inadequate in our view,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Queensland government data, in the past five years seven Queensland coal mine workers have died.\n\n\"If the government and the minister and the regulator want to do something about deterring companies from putting workers in unsafe situations, then that's probably a good place to start, is looking at increasing the penalties that are available,\" Mr Hughes said.\n\nNew safety technology introduced\n\nCurragh mine in central Queensland. (ABC News: Jemima Burt)\n\nAt the time of the accident, Mr Peadon was conducting cable relocation work when he was crushed by a dragline shoe.\n\nCourt documents show the company has spent $5 million over the past three years on developing an industry-first engineering system to prevent precisely the type of incident from occurring again.\n\nThe Proximity Awareness System (PAS) uses three different sensing technologies \u2014 optical, light detection and ranging and radar \u2014 to create three bands of detection and vision around the dragline to automatically stop it from operating if it senses a person's presence in that area.\n\nThe documents show this system has been installed on three of the four draglines at the mine site, with the fourth to be installed next year.\n\nPeer mining companies and RSHQ have also visited the mine to view the PAS in operation.\n\nAs part of its defence, the company said it had also reviewed and added new safety procedures following the accident.\n\nMore improvements needed\n\nMore than 2,000 workers are employed at the Curragh mine in the Bowen Basin.\n\nCoronado Curragh took ownership of the Curragh North mine seven years ago and employs 400 workers and 2,000 contractors.\n\nEighteen months prior to Mr Peadon's death, another worker also died at the Curragh mine site.\n\nDonald Rabbit, 33, died in January 2020 when he was trapped by a heavy falling tyre and rim.\n\nCoronado Curragh and mining contractor Thiess were initially charged with breaching the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999, but all charges were later dropped.\n\nMr Hughes said while there had been some safety improvements for miners since Mr Peadon's death, more needed to be done.\n\n\"We have sadly still seen fatalities occur,\" he said.\n\n\"The work to improve health and safety for all coal mine work has never stopped.\n\n\"We've obviously got to look at these investigations and determine some outcomes to prevent them happening again.\"",

        "text": "If Formula 1 \u2014 like many of the world's pre-eminent dictionaries \u2014 had a word or phrase of the year, 2025's winner would be \"Papaya rules\".\n\nIt is the mythical code that McLaren has adhered to like a sacred text for the past two seasons, as the former backmarker rose to the top of F1.\n\nPapaya rules has ensured drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris achieved maximum points for the team every weekend, en route to back-to-back F1 constructors' championships.\n\nPapaya rules is built on three cornerstones:\n\nDo what is best for the team\n\nDo not crash into each other\n\nEnsure both drivers have a fair playing field\n\nUntil now, papaya rules has worked on the same principle that governs antiques: it only has value if others place value on it.\n\n'That's not fair': Piastri's F1 lead cut after Norris makes lap one contact Oscar Piastri has been left furious at his teammate, and his team, after his two drivers' championship rivals gained ground on him in the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nPiastri and Norris, until now, have placed value on papaya rules.\n\nIt is why Norris let Piastri overtake him for the lead in Hungary 2024, when McLaren's pit strategy allowed the Brit to emerge in front after being behind the Australian by several seconds.\n\nIt is why Piastri allowed Norris to retake second place in Monza this year, after a slow pit stop for the Brit had allowed the Australian to overtake him late in the race.\n\nBut after the Singapore Grand Prix, Piastri may have lessened the value he places on papaya rules.\n\nThe Australian was left ropeable in the cockpit after his teammate overshot the third corner of the grand prix, clipped the back of Max Verstappen in front, then clattered into the side of Piastri.\n\nThe hit to the side of Piastri's McLaren could have sent the Australian into the barrier, but it certainly helped Norris move into third place.\n\nPiastri bemoaned over team radio that they should tell Norris to give the place back.\n\n\"That's not fair, I'm sorry. That's not fair,\" Piastri said over his radio.\n\n\"If he has to avoid another car by crashing into his teammate, then that's a pretty s*** job at avoiding.\"\n\nIn any other team, Norris's move on Piastri would be fair game. It was an aggressive move for position by a driver who wants to win the world championship.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nNorris's move, while not the cleanest, is no different from many that the likes of Verstappen, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher have been praised for.\n\nBut in the world of papaya rules, Norris breached two of its cornerstones.\n\nNorris made contact with a teammate, and, in Piastri's mind, the Australian was unfairly penalised.\n\nFor Piastri, this was the time for papaya rules to ensure he was not disadvantaged \u2014 but it never came.\n\nThe Australian was furious in the car, cut a frustrated figure in the media pen, and watched his lead in the drivers' championship narrow to 22 points.\n\nThis is not the first time in 2025 that Piastri's call for papaya rules fell on deaf ears.\n\nHe was denied victory in the British Grand Prix due to a penalty that McLaren argued against. Despite believing Piastri's penalty was unjust, they did not tell Norris to give the lead of the race back to the Australian \u2014 something Piastri himself requested.\n\nPiastri finished second to Norris in Hungary this year after McLaren \u2014 unbeknownst to him at the time \u2014 put the Brit on a better pit strategy than the Australian. Then at Imola, another advantageous pit strategy for Norris, who was behind Piastri, allowed the Brit again to finish ahead of him.\n\nPiastri has had his share of fortune this year, but none that necessitated the McLaren team needing to make a decision.\n\nFuelled by the disappointment of Singapore, the Australian may now be able to free himself from the papaya rules burden and play by \"Piastri rules\".\n\nPiastri rules are built on one basic principle \u2014 excellence on track.\n\nF1 title battle explained Formula 1 returns to the United States, officially marking the final quarter of an epic 2025 championship. Here is what is to come.\n\nDespite finishing behind Norris, and other title rival Verstappen, in the previous three grands prix, Piastri still holds a solid advantage of 22 and 63 points over his rivals.\n\nHe has won seven grands prix this season, more than any other driver.\n\nIn qualifying, he has been faster than Norris in 10 of the 18 grand prix shootouts. The Australian has been faster than Norris in all three qualifying sessions for sprint races as well.\n\nSprint weekends have been a strength for Piastri in 2025. He has finished second in all three sprint races this season, and then gone on to win the grand prix the following day.\n\nOf the six weekends left this season, three involve a sprint race, including this weekend's action in Austin, Texas.\n\nPiastri's excellence is not only measured in wins and podiums.\n\nTwice he has been awarded F1's Overtake of the Month.\n\nHis overtake in March of Lewis Hamilton on the final lap in Melbourne, after spinning out of second place earlier in the race, showed character and grit.\n\nIn April, Piastri showed supreme confidence through the narrow streets of Jeddah to again pass Hamilton, in a section of track not associated with overtaking.\n\nIt is these triumphs that have the Australian in a position to win a maiden world championship.\n\nNo papaya rules. No team orders. Just raw pace and excellence on track \u2014 Piastri rules.\n\nShould Piastri be able to part ways with the disappointment of Singapore and maintain the driving that has earned him a championship lead this late in the season, he will be in the prime position to achieve the ultimate prize.",

The inspectors that came out spent many hours at my house looking over it, and they said that even they were surprised at how many breaches they found just in one house,\" she said.\n\n\"I currently have no ceilings in the living area of my house. One bathroom, we can't use at all.\n\n\"The other bathroom we can use, but we have to have very quick showers.\n\n\" Luckily, when the ceilings fell down \u2026 all the mould got taken outside in that area. \"\n\nPlumber ordered to fix work\n\nBuilding and Energy have now issued a rectification order to the plumber who did the work.\n\n\"He has the option not to do as ordered, but then I'm presuming the plumber's licensing board will have a lot to say about that if he doesn't,\" Ms Ellis said.\n\nIf he does come back and repair the plumbing, Ms Ellis will still have to cover the cost of the damage caused to other parts of the house herself.\n\nShe said the indemnity payment would cover some of the estimated $60,000 cost, but she will have to pay out around $20,000 herself.\n\nBlack mould is blooming in a cornice at Kathy Ellis's new house.

So we've sold it and moved on.\n\n\"We're not suffering as a result of any of this, compared to others\n\n\"Nonetheless, it was a terrible period of life for us and for a whole lot of other people.\"",

        "text": "Racing NSW and the ATC were at odds ahead of The Everest carnival over the terms of a deal to establish Base Camp, a new $7 million trackside corporate enclosure driven by V\u2019landys, which has been set up in such a rush that building work is expected to continue through Friday night. The sacking of ATC chief executive Matt Galanos then set off a chain of events that led to a sensational public admonishment of the club by Racing NSW chair Saranne Cooke, technically V\u2019landys\u2019 boss, who warned there were \u201csignificant doubts about its ability to survive without ongoing bailouts\u201d. Australian Turf Club chairman Tim Hale argues the member-owned organisation is financially secure. Credit: Steven Siewert Two club directors quit, with one going public with claims of dysfunction on the board, leaving only four remaining \u2013 Hale, media personality Caroline Searcy, technology executive and horse owner David McGrath, and Annette English, a commercial lawyer with close ties to the breeding industry. Three of them were opposed to the controversial proposed $5 billion sale of Rosehill for housing, which triggered a parliamentary inquiry last year before ultimately being defeated by members in May.\n\nThe Racing NSW intervention has brought the sport\u2019s complex, much-debated flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in wagering revenue into back into focus. Most of it lands in the coffers of Racing NSW, which straddles the roles of both regulator and commercial juggernaut, distributing money onwards but also accumulating a war chest that includes $150 million in property. V\u2019landys told last year\u2019s Rosehill inquiry an extra $3 billion had been injected into the industry thanks to Racing NSW\u2019s 2012 High Court win that made the bookies pay up and as a result of its negotiations with the state government on betting-related taxes. Last year\u2019s Everest day was attended by a record crowd of 49,117. Credit: Getty \u201cThis is all new money. Racing NSW\u2019s initiatives have made the money and now some want the keys to the castle,\u201d he said in a written presentation to inquiry committee members. Hale says these are \u201cindustry funds\u201d and much of what is channelled to the club from Racing NSW is earmarked for prizemoney and bonuses paid directly to owners rather than for the club\u2019s operating costs.\n\nV\u2019landys told this masthead the club\u2019s costs had soared and it was not generating enough of its own revenue. \u201cWhatever way you look at it, we\u2019re giving them a lot more money than we\u2019ve ever given them,\u201d he said. With the blowtorch on ATC\u2019s governance, including unspecified alleged code of conduct breaches by directors, eyebrows have also been raised about how Racing NSW has conducted itself. Just this week, the NSW parliament\u2019s privileges committee delivered it a slapdown for its behaviour during the Rosehill inquiry, while this masthead earlier this year reported how Cooke transferred a block of land near Bathurst racecourse to Racing NSW for $1 after buying it in her own name. It also emerged at the inquiry that Racing NSW did not have a human resources department, but a \u201cHR function\u201d carried out by general managers. Cooke said at the time there was nothing inappropriate about the land deal, on which stamp duty was paid by Racing NSW. V\u2019landys maintained the organisation was just defending itself with letters sent to the Rosehill inquiry that included allegations of impropriety against former staff it believed were behind confidential evidence about Racing NSW.\n\nMark Latham, a perennial thorn in V\u2019landys\u2019 side, has been Racing NSW\u2019s loudest detractor but in the strangest of twists has become an ally of sorts in the ATC affair \u2013 if only of the enemy-of-your-enemy-is-your-friend kind. Furious at being banned from the club\u2019s tracks over a run-in with club executive Steve McMahon and thrown out of Randwick a fortnight ago, the Independent MP has branded Hale as \u201cJellyfish Tim\u201d, saying he hopes the board is sacked. As for V\u2019landys himself, there have been fresh questions from industry critics about dual roles as racing\u2019s boss and a hands-on chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission, specifically about how much attention he can devote to his full-time job when he is in charge of two major sports. After more than two decades atop racing, his future has been the subject of much speculation. The latest rumour spreading like wildfire is that he will run the Brisbane Olympic Games in 2032. V\u2019landys doesn\u2019t know how it got started \u2013 \u201cno one has contacted me\u201d \u2013 and there is nothing to indicate there is any basis to it.",

The Herald visited two of the main accommodation options for the Chiefs Village.\n\nHowever, before they can do that, one of the greatest obstacles confronting the Chiefs will be convincing players and their families they will be safe within the country.\n\nThere are bold ambitions to begin talking to players in the coming weeks, plans to pursue Ivan and Nathan Cleary, and predictions of what could be the most valuable jersey in the NRL.\n\nThe Chiefs name was unveiled in Port Moresby last weekend, with the Herald invited to sit in on key meetings, tour potential accommodation and interview key stakeholders.\n\nThe NRL and the PNG Chiefs have begun selling the tax-free dream, revealing their plans to lure players and their families to Papua New Guinea from the end of 2027.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of people in PNG and the reputation is bad, but the reality is not like that,\u201d Chiefs board member and former ARL Commission director Catherine Harris said.\n\nThere is an undertaking from the resort owners to build 80 villas that would house the NRL players and their families before they arrive for pre-season training at the end of 2027, ahead of their entry into the competition in 2028.\n\nThe facility has a tennis court, basketball court, playground, swimming pools, beauty salon, squash courts, restaurants, gym and its own medical centre.\n\nThe appeal of the 11-hectare facility is the available green space and facilities that would be more appealing to families than high-rise apartment and hotel complexes.\n\nThe resort is next to the international airport and fenced off from the outside world.\n\nComplete with its own private island and overwater bungalows just 15 minutes off the coast of Port Moresby, the Airways Resort is the preferred player village of the Australian Rugby League Commission.\n\nThe other option the NRL is considering is the harbour front Marriott apartments. There is vacant land on the water for a purpose-built accommodation facility.\n\n\u201cOne is for families to come out here during the week. The mothers can take the kids and come out for the day. It\u2019s also a great overnight island, so they can come here with their partners or when family members come over to visit during the season. It\u2019s a great place to break the monotony of staying in the players\u2019 and staff village.\u201d\n\nLoloata Island is privately owned by the Airways Resort and will be available to players and families. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cI think this island can work two ways,\u201d Chiefs chairman Ray Dib said.\n\nAs part of the deal, players and their families will have access to the Loloata Island resort.\n\n\u201cEverybody is so conscious about security, it\u2019s almost safer because everyone is so conscious of it. It\u2019s like working in a workforce where safety is really important. You feel safe. It\u2019s the same here in PNG.\u201d\n\nThe other major appeal of the Marriott Apartments is the indoor-outdoor mezzanine level, which is being dubbed \u201cNRL House\u201d and is being offered as a private facility for players and their families.\n\nThe pool overlooking the harbour in the existing Marriott building being offered to the NRL. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been going there, I\u2019ve never witnessed or experienced any concerns. But there\u2019s obviously places where you don\u2019t go after dark, or you [don\u2019t] drive down certain streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, safety is a priority,\u201d Dib said. \u201cSome years ago, I took my wife and my daughter there when we built a school with the Bulldogs there. They never had a concern.\n\nThis is a concern for the NRL despite the appeal of a waterfront location and new facilities adjacent to a fast-developing CBD.\n\nWhile the harbour front precinct has a heavy security presence, it\u2019s not separated from the outside world.\n\nThe harbourside site owned by the Marriott which is being considered as the site for the Chiefs\u2019 accommodation village. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question about that. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be doing this. But it\u2019s long term, and it requires investment now. And the long-term gains are that as this country develops and as the ecosystem develops, there are a number of revenue drivers or spin-offs from it.\n\n\u201cIt is going to diversify, strengthen, and grow the game\u2019s whole of game revenues,\u201d he said.\n\nBut NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo hit back at suggestions the league was out of its depth with this project.\n\nIt is viewed in some quarters as a $600 million gift from the government to the NRL, leaving some pundits sceptical of the PNG team\u2019s place in the competition.\n\nMost see this venture as a geopolitical power play.\n\nThe third option is the Hilton Hotel; however, a lack of green space and its location are expected to be deterrents.\n\nPapua New Guinea fans at PM XIII game in Port Moresby. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cOne thing we do know about sporting clubs is that they are becoming increasingly more valuable. So, we are creating a franchise that will one day in the future, in the near future, have a value of somewhere between 50 and $100 million.\u201d\n\nDib echoed that sentiment, predicting high sponsorship revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with sponsorship over in PNG and in Australia,\u201d Dib said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised by the number of international brands that will be on our jersey. Money won\u2019t be an issue for us. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be at the top.\u201d\n\nHow will the Chiefs attract big-name players?\n\nDib held the role of chairman at the Canterbury Bulldogs during a successful period when they reached grand finals in 2012 and 2014.\n\nHe knows players are unlikely to sign long-term contracts to join the Chiefs, but believes the financial perks could represent the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic. I\u2019m confident once we get them there, and they see the facilities and what we have in mind, the vision that Peter [V\u2019landys, ARL Commission chairman] and Andrew have got for the franchise ... that they\u2019ll be able to enjoy the period and also gain financially and academically,\u201d Dib said.\n\nRay Dib and Andrew Abdo on their way out to visit Loloata Island. Credit: Michael Chammas\n\n\u201cNot just the players but also their families. They will come back in a better financial position and ready with their next career move in mind. Let\u2019s be honest, the players have got a limited lifespan in rugby league.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a young bloke starting out, you want an opportunity to play in the NRL and maximise your minimum [early career] salary, that\u2019s got to be an attraction. If you\u2019re a player coming towards retirement, if you haven\u2019t really established a great asset base, it\u2019s a place that might help you in the last couple of years of your career.\u201d\n\nHas the tax-free incentive been signed off?\n\nThe Australian government is yet to sign off on the promised income tax exemption, but Abdo says the players have nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely tax-free in PNG,\u201d Abdo said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the process of confirming the exemption for ensuring that non-resident Australians aren\u2019t taxed in Australia.\n\nNRL CEO Andrew Abdo addressed the PNG Chiefs board last week. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cThe legislation exists already, and it\u2019s really just around formalising that through the actual package that will be offered to these individuals.\u201d\n\nResidents of other countries will not be entitled to the exemption as the deal is between the Australian and PNG governments.\n\nAs a result, New Zealand and England residents will not be financially advantaged by joining the Chiefs, reducing the potential player pool.\n\nWhich players are the Chiefs chasing?\n\nThe Chiefs are set to approach the NRL to request that they be allowed to sign players from November 1 this year.\n\nThe club doesn\u2019t want to wait until this time next year to begin building its roster and is keen to try and convince players to join the Chiefs two years before they enter the competition.\n\nThat would require a player to agree to a contract for 2028 and sign a one-year deal for 2027 with another club.\n\nPayne Haas is a free agent as of November 1. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe would be crazy not to engage [with players], but I just need to speak to the NRL about it and whether we\u2019re allowed to sign future contracts if they are free agents,\u201d Dib said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have a discussion very soon about. That would be an ideal position [to talk to players from November 1 this year]. If we can do that then yeah, absolutely we should be doing that.\n\n\u201cIf the NRL say we can do that and the player is willing to play with someone else in the interim, we\u2019d be crazy not to see what\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nThat would put Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, Payne Haas, Luke Metcalf, Jayden Campbell, Harry Grant and Liam Henry firmly on the Chiefs\u2019 radar.\n\nV\u2019landys has also made no secret of his desire to lure Wayne Bennett to Papua New Guinea.\n\nNathan Cleary celebrates with his father and coach Ivan Cleary. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHe may get his way because, under its constitution, the ARLC has the final say on whom the coach and chief executive will be.\n\nOther potential targets could include Panthers coach Ivan Cleary, who is off contract at the end of 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also Nathan Cleary\u2019s final year on contract at Penrith. His partner, Mary Fowler, has Papua New Guinean heritage.\n\nThe stadium and centre of excellence\n\nSantos National Stadium will be the Chiefs\u2019 home base, with plans in place to upgrade the venue\u2019s capacity from 15,000 to 20,000.\n\nThe site for the PNG first grade training field and centre of excellence is right next to the existing stadium that will be used as the team\u2019s home ground. Construction is expected to commence in the new year.\n\nOutside the $600 million Australian government investment that goes to the NRL, the PNG government has pledged to invest in the upgrade of the stadium and a nearby centre of excellence.\n\nThe Chiefs are building a temporary office inside the stadium grandstand, but will move to the centre of excellence which is expected to rival the facilities used by the Parramatta Eels and North Queensland Cowboys.\n\nWhat are some of the other challenges?\n\nGiven the year-round high temperatures and humidity, night matches would provide more suitable conditions when the Chiefs play at home.\n\nFans at the match between the PM\u2019s XIII and PNG in Port Moresby.

THEATRE\n\nMEOW MEOW\u2019S THE RED SHOES\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, October 15, until November 9\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 A fright wig and false eyelashes can only take you so far. From the time she clawed her way into our hearts nearly 25 years ago, Meow Meow backed up the ditsy exterior trappings in her cabaret shows with a striking singing voice and a zany, gloriously unpredictable stage persona. Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes is a cat of a different colour. She has presented shows derived from Hans Christian Andersen before, reimagining The Little Mermaid and The Little Match Girl. If her Red Shoes, here having its premiere season, happily has no girl\u2019s dancing feet being chopped off, it does feel like it was shooed into the rehearsal room with director Kate Champion while only a kitten\u2019s fetus. Kanen Breen and Meow Meow in Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes. Credit: Brett Boardman\n\nNot a play, it\u2019s a cabaret show with themes of red shoes and greed, lovingly wrapped in improbably juxtaposed songs, ranging from what I presume was her own Why Must There Be an Opening Number? to Radiohead\u2019s No Surprises and Patrick Watson\u2019s Here Comes a River. These are expertly performed with singer Kanen Breen, pianist Mark Jones, bassist Dan Witton and guitarist/percussionist Jethro Woodward, who also become props and characters. Meow, of course, is the main event. To begin, she\u2019s dragged on stage comatose: the eternal show girl, now loath to perform. Then she sings, dances, talks, improvises, climbs things, dies, eats a sandwich, dresses, undresses, pumps the bellows of a harmonium with her foot and even pinches audience members\u2019 handbags and clothing. Yet after a while \u2013 and it only last 75 minutes \u2013 I was thinking that there was something richer and darker to be mined from The Red Shoes than this; that there\u2019s too much surface and not enough substance. The show unfolds as a series of songs interlinked by the \u201cred shoes\u201d theme. Credit: Brett Boardman Don\u2019t get me wrong: her singing can still be glorious and her sheer zaniness intoxicating. In the latter regard, she\u2019s something of a throwback to the Dada movement of a century ago, with meaning less important than surprising images and songs. But the Meow Meow who can be achingly funny was missing too often, with not much to replace it. She laments the failure of communism in its \u201call for one and one for all\u201d sense, delightfully reimagines Hamlet as a Eurovision song and quizzes Andersen (Breen) about his layered meanings in The Red Shoes. Little illumination results (although the meaning of Andersen\u2019s tale is very much in the reader\u2019s mind). Nothing is explicit \u2013 and that\u2019s, no doubt, the point of the show. But here her theatrical version of chaos theory needs another layer, whether of humour or narrative, or there\u2019s a slight feeling of the empress having insufficient clothes (despite multiple costume changes). Perhaps Champion needed to be a more rigorous director to help distil something beyond random flights of fancy. Meow is so innately gifted, captivating and, above all, audacious, but here it\u2019s just not quite enough.\n\nMUSIC\n\nTEDDY SWIMS\n\nQudos Bank Arena, October 14\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Finding galaxies of love under tattooed eyelids, and a kingly swagger in white socks riding free on stocky legs, the cuddly American gangster of self-acceptance and soul took Sydney right up to the heavenly high he\u2019s on in his healing journey, with big-budget pyrotechnics to match those big-belted feels. Since the breakout success of I\u2019ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1) in 2023, with its heavyweight hits about toxic co-dependency, addiction and heartbreak, Teddy Swims has come a long way. He\u2019s been to therapy, for one. He\u2019s also found love again, the wholesome kind. Plus, with global tours and billions of streams, the former YouTube cover artist sure is making bank. Teddy Swims with band Freaky Feely at Qudos Bank Arena. Credit: Glenn Pokorny/Qudos Bank Arena \u201cI\u2019m so grateful towards my shitty ex-girlfriend,\u201d he joked good-heartedly to a packed arena. Though Teddy still pays tribute to (Part 1), tucking a few of the best into the encore, this tour is a celebration in the spirit of 2025\u2019s (Part 2), where he\u2019s come out of all that pain to a place he couldn\u2019t have imagined a few years back: enormous gratitude.\n\nSydney is his first Australian tour stop, but his second October show, having won hearts in a kilt at the NRL Grand Finals. Still with Freaky Feely backing \u2013 the high school band he\u2019s brought with him on the up and up \u2013 it\u2019s a two-hour-long theatre of the full second album tracklist, and then some. A natural performer, we see Teddy crooning Bad Dreams into a mic stand shaped like a voluptuous woman, going back to the raw place with Some Things I\u2019ll Never Know, getting tender with Small Hands devoted to his new baby boy, crowd-pleasing at the close with Lose Control. It\u2019s a powerful, oaky, aching voice: soaked in decades of smoke and liquor; trained on YouTube clips, high school musicals and Atlanta area bands; and set on its god-gifted course to slow-burning stardom by a sweetheart dad who introduced him to the likes of Al Green. The production gives him the panache he deserves, while showing his sense of humour. At one point, following rolling fog and shooting flames, we see Teddy reappear on the summit of a golden ramp on a dunny throne from a hidden trapdoor. Wardrobe whirls him through a white cowboy suit, a tarot-patterned silk robe, a black T and shorts, and a creamy trench coat. Shoes? When you\u2019re that grounded, who needs \u2019em. It\u2019s no wonder audiences adore him: an everyman shot to pop firmaments on true talent, ribbing and relishing the trappings of class. A role model for a generation leaning into the strength of vulnerability, it\u2019s big love all round. THEATRE\n\nTHE SHIRALEE\n\nDrama Theatre, October 10\n\nUntil November 29\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nA deep sense of mythology surrounds the reader in D\u2019Arcy Niland\u2019s 1955 novel, The Shiralee. It\u2019s as if the very landscape of mid-20th-century Australia is misanthropic, while those inhabiting it can be as deadly as brown snakes. In adapting the novel, playwright Kate Mulvany and director Jessica Arthur (for Sydney Theatre Company) have been aware of this quality, but they\u2019ve only partially succeeded in transmitting it through their production. Too often this feels like a musical minus the songs: as gooey as a box of chocolates in the sun when attempting warmth of heart, and a little lame and stagy when shooting for menace. Kate Mulvany, Ziggy Resnick and Josh McConville in The Shiralee for the Sydney Theatre Company. Credit: Prudence Upton Niland\u2019s novel tells of Mac, an itinerant jack-of-all-trades, who arrives back in Sydney to find his wife in bed with another bloke. Mac sorts out the bloke with his fists, and his wife by taking their daughter, Buster, and hitting the road. It\u2019s a tale of a little girl adoring her remote, belligerent father, and gradually wearing away his armoured outer layer, almost as slowly as water acts on stone. Given the limitations of child actors, Buster is now nine rather than four, which shifts the dynamic considerably, as a four-year-old is obviously more helpless and dependent. Mulvany uses this shift to craft a more knowing, perceptive and wily Buster, and then Arthur has cast the notable Ziggy Resnick in the role. Although over a dozen years older than Buster, Resnick locates the truth of the bashfulness, eagerness, playfulness, bewilderment, humour, earnestness and staunch morality.\n\nZiggy Resnick and Josh McComville with Paul Capsis (centre) as Desmond the bush poet. Credit: Prudence Upton Mulvany also makes Buster more influential and more evenly matched in size of role with Mac, played by Josh McConville. McConville is convincing as the bluff, taciturn man who solves money problems with his sweat, and people problems with his fists. Tempered like steel in a forge, he is loath to let this slip of a girl, this shiralee (or burden) change his pugnacious, self-absorbed life. Niland peoples his novel with vivid incidental characters, and a further six actors assume multiple roles, including Mulvany herself playing Marge, Buster\u2019s mother, whom she makes more rounded and sympathetic now she\u2019s not just being seen through Mac\u2019s eyes. Aaron Pedersen and Josh McConville in The Shiralee. Credit: Prudence Upton Paul Capsis is ideal as the superbly eccentric Desmond, a cycling swaggie and published bush poet. He (as do most of the minor characters) offers flickers of illumination to the protagonists, especially Buster, who is photographic paper in this regard compared with Mac\u2019s carbon paper. Stephen Anderson, Lucia Mastrantone, Aaron Pedersen and Catherine Van-Davies complete the cast.\n\nUnlike the book, the story is told chronologically, which perhaps partly undermines that mythic quality: time is now linear rather than looped. But Jeremy Allen\u2019s set bolsters the mythology, expertly using the Drama Theatre\u2019s widescreen stage, while Jessica Dunn\u2019s music amplifies the sense of space, foreboding and starry-skied wonderment. Alas, they can\u2019t help the fact that when the play swerves back towards naturalism, it should be woven from grittier fabric. MUSIC\n\nHARRY BENNETTS PERFORMS BEETHOVEN\u2019S VIOLIN CONCERTO\n\nSydney Symphony Orchestra, City Recital Hall, October 9\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Harry Bennetts played Beethoven\u2019s Violin Concerto with a sweet sound, fine line and nuanced care, allowing the work\u2019s beauties to unfold lyrically without false drama or undue storminess. Conductor Umberto Clerici began the opening orchestral tutti with unhurried gentleness. There was no hint of spikiness when the string parts took up the quiet opening drum beats, and the phrases breathed in long lines, moving with the breadth and inevitability of a noble river. Harry Bennetts, conductor Umberto Clerici and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Sydney Symphony Orchestra\n\nWhen Bennetts took up the solo entry, it was not with the swagger of a virtuoso driven by posturing heroics, but rather with a focus on allowing the work\u2019s intricacies to blossom with precision and clarity. In the codetta section, as the orchestra starts to surge, Bennett twice responded to the challenge with aptly projected vigour, but on the third, took on the Orphean task of taming them with quiet calm. In the development section, when the soloist brings back the opening theme in B minor, high in the violin\u2019s range, Bennetts created a memorable moment of transparent expressiveness without excess. The cadenza of the first movement (by Joachim) held attention with its even, unpressed resonance, contrapuntal clarity, glowing tone and true intonation without a hint of roughness or unwanted bow noise. All of this, of course, requires some freedom with the tempo which, for me, was slightly overdone in the Coda. The slow movement captured a sense of fresh stillness, Bennett ornamenting the underlying orchestral theme with balanced ornamentation of silvery brightness. I occasionally found the sense of pulse in the orchestral playing floated so freely it almost dissolved. The finale had beguiling buoyancy from both soloist and conductor. After another finely polished cadenza and exuberant Coda, Bennett started the last arpeggio with hushed insouciance as though beginning a new episode before the orchestra emphatically stopped any further discussion. In the second half Clerici and the Sydney Symphony again emphasised gentle lyricism in Schubert\u2019s Symphony No. 4 in C minor, D. 417 Tragic. The first movement was fretful and agitated (\u2018Tragic\u2019 as a subtitle has always seemed a little overblown) and the second gracious. In the third movement, Clerici and the SSO played Schubert\u2019s cross-accents to create a sense of poised ambiguity. The finale was neat and discursive, as the young Schubert (he was only 19) was prone to be.\n\nDANCE\n\nTHE BOGONG\u2019S SONG: A CALL TO COUNTRY\n\nBangarra Studio Theatre, October 9, until October 19\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN (with James and Teddy Gribble, and Charlie Price)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nMy co-reviewers Jamie (aged eight), his brother Teddy and their cousin Charlie (both aged six) didn\u2019t even make it to their seats before being captivated by the moody blue uplighting at Bangarra Studio Theatre. It was a foretaste of the atmospheric vibe of Bangarra Dance Theatre\u2019s school holiday show The Bogong\u2019s Song by Yolande Brown and Chenoa Deemal, for ages five plus. It tells the story of siblings Beau and Myee (played by Benjin Maza and Tjilala Brown-Roberts, both fabulous triple threats). They are dream-transported to ancestral Country in the Snowy Mountains, where they must find a missing Bogong moth, healing the land and their own hearts along the way. \u201cThey were in sync like all the time when they danced!\u201d Jamie observed. Benjin Maza and Tjilala Brown-Roberts in The Bogong\u2019s Song. Credit: Edwina Pickles The Bogong\u2019s Song features pretty much everything you could think of for a children\u2019s production. There\u2019s acting, singing, rapping, animated backgrounds, talking trees, hand-held puppets, shadow puppets, sing-alongs, and dancing. While the pacing can be patchy and the narrative occasionally lags, enough happens to keep things rolling. And the animal characters are a hit. \u201cI liked the possum and the baby possum!\u201d enthused Teddy. \u201cI liked the lizard,\u201d responds Charlie. \u201cHe was funny because he said he would eat the moth but then he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nJamie agreed. \u201cHe was hilarious! He used a chip packet as a solar panel!\u201d There are also heartfelt lessons. \u201cIt was about helping the endangered moths,\u201d explained Jamie. \u201c[The siblings] needed to connect with Country, which meant listening to Country and the land. It made me feel good, but a little bit sad for how the world was treated.\u201d Teddy nodded thoughtfully: \u201cThey were trying to not let the worlds separate.\u201d The Bogong\u2019s Song also grapples with Australia\u2019s shockingly young age of criminal responsibility, as Beau and Myee grieve the imprisonment of their deaf little brother Joey. That part, recounted Jamie, is \u201cvery, very sad\u201d. \u201cHe stole lollies. He went to jail. And he was 10. He was confused and scared. Couldn\u2019t he just get a fine?\u201d\n\nThe high point is the finale, featuring an all-too-short traditional dance featuring ochre paint and didgeridoo music. This part has no wisecracking animals or cartoons, but its power is immediately palpable. The children in the audience become transfixed, completely still and silent, as if responding to some deep, ancient summons that cuts through all the screens, lights, and noise. MUSIC\n\nTHE TALLIS SCHOLARS\n\nSydney Opera House, October 12\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Tallis Scholars began their eleventh Australian tour with a glowing, subtly invigorated sound of rich density and iridescent edge in the splendid eight-part motet Deus in adiutorium by the 17th century Spanish/Mexican composer Juan Gutierrez de Padilla. In an interview earlier in the day, director and founder of the Tallis Scholars, Peter Phillips, gave some insight into what gives this doyen of Renaissance vocal ensembles its distinctive tonal quality which is so elusive to describe yet instantly loved by audiences worldwide. He spoke of the micro-refinements of tuning that singers undertake when singing without instruments. Equally important, of course, is the talent, dedication and professionalism of the singers and, in Phillips\u2019 case, 53 years of experience in refining and perfecting the Tallis Scholars to lay bare the glories of the Renaissance with transparent clarity.\n\nListening closely to the vibrant chords of Padilla\u2019s work, one can hear, beyond the purity of tone and pitch, small harmonics of the sort one hears in singing from Bulgaria to Tibet that add shafts of colour and engender delight. The program was built around the theme of chant which appeared in beguiling simplicity in the next work, in principio by 12th century abbess, Hildegard of Bingen, sung by a sub-group of female singers with disarming naturalness of line and rhythm. A more recent adaptation of chant-based melodic and polyphonic structures was then presented in Arvo Part\u2019s Triodion, written for the 150th anniversary of Lancing College in Sussex, England. A different range of harmonics emerged in the halos of Part\u2019s delicately soft blends of humming, solo and widely spaced voices, leading to a still central point that even a fretful baby in the audience could not disturb. After another chant by Hildegard the first half concluded with the substantial motet by Jacob Obrecht, Salve Regina, in which varying groupings of the 10 voices coalesced and mutated to create a sense of timeless calm. To start the second half, the singers split into widely separated groups for Allegri\u2019s Miserere mei, Deus. Phillips directed the first chorus from the stage, a solo singer sang chant section from the eastern gallery, while, high in the south-western part of the hall the second chorus was heard magically from behind as soprano Emma Walsh embellished the choral sound by repeatedly ascending with apparently effortless grace to an ethereal high C. Part\u2019s Magnificat and Da Pacem Domine again led listeners to utterances that were at once almost inaudibly quiet yet palpable and definite. After Hildegard\u2019s O ecclesia, Josquin des Prez\u2019 Praeter rerum began with darker low-pitched textures, ending with the richly rewarding choral sound that had been heard at the start and to which it is so easy to become addicted. MUSIC\n\nTRIO ISIMSIZ\n\nCity Recital Hall, October 13\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nIn the Renaissance, a missa sine nomine was literally \u201ca Mass without a name\u201d, which meant that, unlike most Masses of the time, it didn\u2019t build on pre-existing material. Violinist Pablo Hernan Benedi, cellist Edvard Pogossian and pianist Erdem Misirlioglu have adopted the same paradoxical nomenclature by christening themselves Trio Isimsiz, which is Turkish for \u201ctrio without name\u201d. Their program of music by Brahms, Coll and Schubert also consisted of works without names in that all of them were simply called \u201cPiano Trio\u201d, though the trio by Francisco Coll did make references to pre-existing music and styles, which flitted into the background like music half-remembered in a dream. Musica Viva\u2019s Trio Isimsiz \u2013 violinist Pablo Hernan Benedi, cellist Edvard Pogossian and pianist Erdem Misirlioglu \u2013 at the City Recital Hall. Credit: Dylan Alcock One allusion was to Strauss\u2019 comic opera Die Schweigsame Frau (The Silent Woman) about an old man whose intolerance of noise becomes a vehicle for his torment by the young. It was, in one sense, a metaphor for the way chaotic textures in Coll\u2019s trio fragmented and subverted coherent musical ideas just as they began to emerge. The trio began with a short spiky restless movement in which pizzicato string notes and scattered staccato chords from the piano were thrown frenetically across the range of all three instruments, like someone tearing up a first draft. The second movement, the longest and weightiest, began with a bell-like chord on the piano and explored expressive melody and quiet, lonely spaces, sustaining ideas and building up tension in a more familiar way. The third movement returned to fragmented thinking, lurching in two-note figures from violin and cello accompanied by shattered sprays of notes from the piano.",

        "text": "Even when Dad does manage to take August to the park, which is a five-minute walk, he needs to rest.\n\nInstead, he is slumped on the lounge in their Bondi home. He\u2019s been there on and off for weeks, except between 11am and 4pm. He\u2019s been sleeping for about 12 hours a day.\n\nA few good matches to start the 2024-25 season for NSW in the Sheffield Shield, and Dad might have been opening the batting for Australia last summer against India.\n\nHe\u2019s too young to realise his father, Nic, is a very good cricketer. Not just any good cricketer, but the proud owner of a baggy green \u2013 and one of the most exciting batsmen in Australia over the past 15 years.\n\nAugust, a cheerful and energetic two-year-old boy, is confused. Cars. Lego. Passing a footy. Anything. Why isn\u2019t Dad being fun any more?\n\nAugust Maddinson just wants to play with Dad. Just like he\u2019s always done.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want sympathy or for this to be a sob story. That\u2019s not in his nature, says his best mate Adam Zampa.\n\nNic Maddinson is glad it\u2019s all over. After this interview, his private battle with testicular cancer will no longer be a secret.\n\n\u201cWe just told him that I was sick, and I was taking some medicine that made my hair fall out. We told him I was going to be OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe understood quite a lot of what was going on. He\u2019s a pretty intelligent kid. He was always rubbing my hair and asking what happened to it.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part was having to tell August I couldn\u2019t play with him,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cI was just so physically exhausted that I couldn\u2019t get off the couch.\n\nAugust has been telling people his dad no longer has hair because the wind blew it away. His mother, Bianca, is six months pregnant with his soon-to-be brother.\n\nA video pops up. Zampa, another star hailing from the NSW south coast, was one of the few who knew about Maddinson\u2019s cancer battle.\n\nHe sips a long black and scrolls on his phone, looking at photos from when chemotherapy kept him in bed most of the day.\n\nFollowing months of appointments, needles, chemotherapy sessions and sleepless nights, Maddinson is finally ready to tell his story \u2013 one only a small circle of cricketers have known about.\n\nNic Maddinson ahead of his Test debut against South Africa at the Adelaide Oval in 2016. Credit: Ryan Pierse\n\nAfter three Test matches, six T20 internationals, 129 first-class fixtures, 105 List A games and 144 T20s around the globe, cricket has been an afterthought for the 33-year-old who, half a lifetime ago, was one of the country\u2019s brightest young batting talents.\n\nIn the distance, a curator is preparing a pitch for Saturday\u2019s match between Maddinson\u2019s club, Eastern Suburbs, and Penrith \u2013 not that he\u2019ll be playing.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous Wednesday morning in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, and August is walking towards a cafe near Waverley Oval with his dad, mum, and two-week-old brother, Wilder, who is in a pram.\n\n\u201cI thought it would mean a lot. I think I would have regretted it if I didn\u2019t send it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019ll just do the video and no one will work it out,\u201d Maddinson says of his diagnosis. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought I was going OK. Looking at that video, he looks so shit, and sick, and pale. I feel 100 times better than I did then.\n\nZampa\u2019s wife, Harriet, rang Bianca to say there was no pressure to send a video if he wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. Maddinson did anyway.\n\nNic Maddinson (left) and Adam Zampa in 2009 after being picked for the NSW under-19 cricket team. Credit: Greg Totman\n\nOf course, he did. It was his best mate. He knew \u201cZamps\u201d would love it. The only problem was that Maddinson hadn\u2019t told anyone he was undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nAhead of Zampa\u2019s 100th T20 international against the West Indies in July, Maddinson was asked if he\u2019d like to send a video message that would be played on the team bus ahead of the match in St Kitts.\n\nWhile packing a suitcase at home, Maddinson\u2019s phone rang. It was Orchard.\n\nAt his end-of-season review, Maddinson mentioned the lump to Cricket Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Dr John Orchard. A Friday afternoon appointment was booked in minutes.\n\nThen he felt a lump. His GP thought it was probably a virus, but still recommended a scan. There were no available appointments, so it would have to wait until after the trip.\n\nHe felt sick and run-down but was looking forward to a holiday in Byron Bay.\n\nThis time last year, Maddinson was in the frame for a recall to the Australian Test team. Five months later, after a disappointing season yielding 267 runs at an average of 17.8, he was dropped for NSW\u2019s final Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania.\n\n\u201cTo have that pop up for me on an important day for me was really cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt got me a bit,\u201d Zampa says. \u201cI think people in the team who didn\u2019t know what was going on saw my reaction and thought, \u2018jeez, I had no idea\u2019.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should get on the plane tomorrow,\u201d Orchard said.\n\nThe scans confirmed a tumour. Maddinson rang Bianca at work to break the news.\n\nShe flew up the following day, while Maddinson stayed in Sydney for more tests. He still arrived in Byron Bay on the Sunday for a quick trip \u201cto let it all sink in\u201d.\n\nThree days later, Maddinson underwent surgery.\n\nNSW cricketer Nic Maddinson has overcome testicular cancer. Credit: Louie Douvis\n\n\u201cI was with John waiting for some scans, and that\u2019s when it hit me the most,\u201d he says. \u201cI had the surgery and I didn\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d\n\nThen, after about seven weeks, came the words he didn\u2019t want to hear: \u201cThe cancer has spread.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce I found out I had to have chemo, that was pretty hard to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had spread to parts of my abdominal lymph nodes and lung. That was a bit where it was pretty daunting. Bianca was the one asking all the questions. It was a bit of a blur. I\u2019m glad she was there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in awe of how strong and supportive she was through everything. She even quit her job as a dentist the day we found out I needed chemo.\n\n\u201cShe took on literally everything at home, so I could rest when I needed, all while pregnant and struggling with her own sleep and looking after two dogs and a toddler.\n\n\u201cThere were definitely days when it broke me mentally having to get up and go to hospital, and she helped me push through.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to sit with me, all day every day, but I felt guilty for wasting her days, so she only came in a handful of times.\n\n\u201cImagine if I hadn\u2019t gone to the doctor.\u201d\n\nNic Maddinson celebrates notching a ton for Victoria against NSW in 2020. Credit: AAP\n\nMaddinson thought he\u2019d miss a few weeks in the off-season. But he was told his vision, hearing and fitness might never be the same. Reality hit home.\n\n\u201cCricket was the last thing I wanted to think about,\u201d he says.\n\nZampa was worried.\n\n\u201cIn my head, I\u2019m unfortunately thinking about the worst-case scenario,\u201d the leg-spinner says. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to my best mate? He had a really positive outlook on it. He just got on with it and didn\u2019t make a fuss about it.\u201d\n\nOn May 19, Maddinson embarked on his greatest challenge yet. Facing the fastest bowlers in the world was light work compared to five hours of chemotherapy every day at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital \u2013 a five-minute drive from the SCG.\n\nNine weeks. Three cycles. Three weeks each. Endless sleep.\n\n\u201cAt the start, I actually felt OK,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cIt takes a while to get into your system. By day three, I felt like I\u2019d been hit by a truck. I didn\u2019t really improve much after that.\u201d\n\nNic Maddinson prepares to begin chemotherapy.\n\nOn day four, things took a turn. NSW teammate Moises Henriques came to visit. He sat silently, watching his mate have his body pumped full of drugs.\n\n\u201cI remember saying to Moey, \u2018I just need to sleep today, mate. There\u2019s no point hanging around too long\u2019.\u201d\n\nZampa offered to fly to Sydney whenever he could.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had someone close to me go through it,\u201d Zampa says. \u201cIt was drop everything to try and help. He was lucky he had good support around.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been really stubborn, so receiving help and asking for it when it\u2019s needed certainly isn\u2019t his strength. I couldn\u2019t have imagined going through it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking to my wife about it, then getting off the phone to Maddo, and I don\u2019t really have the answers myself or know how to help.\u201d\n\nMaddinson felt bloated and put on weight.\n\n\u201cBy the second or third week, I lost all my hair. I was feeling pretty average,\u201d he says. \u201cI was taking types of steroids to manage side effects, but they would keep me up at night. I\u2019d be at the hospital from about 11am to 4pm. Then a sleep. Then I\u2019d force myself to have dinner. I\u2019d sleep until about 1am, but sometimes I\u2019d then be awake until 6am. I found that difficult. I was super drained and felt like I had to sleep 24/7.\n\n\u201cI felt guilty. I couldn\u2019t do anything around the house.\u201d\n\nOnly a handful knew \u2013 family, Zampa, Sean Abbott, Henriques, Josh Philippe, Cricket NSW high-performance boss Greg Mail, and a handful of other friends outside of cricket. Word spread quietly, but Maddinson wanted to keep it tight.\n\nDuring the winter, Mail told Blues players.\n\nMaddinson, with no hair, moustache or beard, turned up one morning at Centennial Park to have a coffee with teammates before a fitness session. Hair was always Maddinson\u2019s thing. He once bleached it peroxide blond before a Big Bash game and joked that \u201cGwen Stefani\u201d was the inspiration.\n\nNic Maddinson\u2019s blond era. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cNone of the boys asked, but it was pretty obvious something was going on,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cI looked completely different.\n\n\u201cI wanted to feel like myself and go for a walk or a run. I didn\u2019t really want to train for cricket. Batting didn\u2019t interest me. I wasn\u2019t envious of them playing. That was the first time in my life. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve really wanted to play.\u201d\n\nHe suspected some players on Australia\u2019s Test tour of the West Indies knew. Some nights, when he couldn\u2019t sleep, he\u2019d watch the first session of action in the Caribbean on television as Bianca and August slept.\n\nSam Konstas, his NSW opening partner, was struggling with the bat for Australia \u2013 and so was Maddinson, in a different way.\n\nIn the morning, August would often find his dad asleep on the couch. He just wanted to go to the park again.\n\n\u201cYou try and put yourself in those shoes, and it\u2019s almost impossible to explain to your kid why you can\u2019t play with them,\u201d Zampa says. \u201cHis little guy Augie is an absolute champion. He\u2019s all over the place and a ball of energy.\u201d\n\nMaddinson adds: \u201cAt home, he\u2019d want to chase me down the hallway and tackle me.\n\n\u201cBianca ended up saying to me, \u2018I think you\u2019re trying to do too much\u2019. I tried to ride my bike one day and feel stupid for doing it now. I knew I felt terrible, but I just wanted to do something that I was used to doing.\n\n\u201cIt was the slowest and longest nine weeks.\u201d\n\nMaddinson felt foggy and spaced out. He watched a lot of Netflix and cycling races. He deferred an online undergraduate psychology course at Curtin University because he was so exhausted.\n\n\u201cI was in hospital every Monday for about 12 weeks in a row. The first Monday we didn\u2019t have to go into hospital was such a relief.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part mentally was having to get a needle every day. I had bruised hands and forearms from the number of needles. I don\u2019t think I could have physically taken myself back in there for one more day.\n\n\u201cI felt I was mentally pretty strong but I think I would have thrown it in.\u201d\n\nJuly 14 was a good day. Chemo was finally done.\n\nMaddinson felt terrible but summoned the energy for a photo with August, who\u2019d made a sign for his dad.\n\nIt said \u201cLAST CHEMO\u201d and was covered with stickers of dinosaurs.\n\nNic Maddinson with son August after his last chemotherapy session.\n\nTen days later, he texted Blues batting coach Nick Larkin.\n\n\u201cCan I come and hit some balls?\u201d\n\nOn July 28, still feeling terrible, he drove to Sydney Olympic Park, padded up and put a helmet on. No one else was there.\n\nLarkin threw down some cross-seamers. The dashing left-hander belted them. He batted for half an hour, hit about 100 balls, and walked out. It was what he needed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t touch a bat for a month after that,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cIt was a weird feeling. Every time I mishit one, I got angry at myself in the nets. It was the first time I could bat without a care in the world.\n\n\u201cI stopped batting for a little bit because I didn\u2019t want to just not care.\n\n\u201cEight weeks after my last chemo round, I got good news. The treatment had worked.\u201d\n\nThe road back to cricket wasn\u2019t straightforward. The batting and strength returned. His fitness is still a work in progress.\n\n\u201cMy recent tests were all good, and I can go about getting back into cricket, which I love,\u201d he says.\n\nVictorian openers Nic Maddinson (left) and Will Pucovski in 2020. Credit: Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Maddinson had a centre wicket net session with a few Blues squad members.\n\nOnce he faces some faster bowlers and ticks a few fielding boxes, Maddinson will be eligible for selection \u2013 perhaps for Easts, NSW Second XI, or the Blues\u2019 Shield match at the SCG from November 10 to 13.\n\nHave his goals changed?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough question to answer right now. Yes and no,\u201d he says. \u201cI would still love to play Test cricket again, but I\u2019m more realistic. The older you get, the less likely it is to happen.\n\n\u201cI had a really good opportunity last year and I just didn\u2019t really grab it. I\u2019m just really excited to try and play cricket again. I was dropped at the end of last year, so I\u2019m not expecting to be straight back in the side.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing would be to say I am available. That would be a nice day.\u201d\n\nHe hopes something good comes of telling his story.\n\nNic Maddinson holding new son Wilder, alongside August and wife Bianca.\n\n\u201cI feel very lucky I live in a country where we have good medical care,\u201d he says. \u201cI am in a pretty privileged position to have access to John Orchard. He helped sort out all my appointments and was with me the whole time.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out I needed chemo, it hit me hard because I almost didn\u2019t go. I thought it would go away. To know that I caught it probably as early as I could have, and it still spread into other parts of my body, that was scary.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s so important if you have anything you\u2019re worried about, get it checked out.\n\n\u201cIt feels silly to not tell my story. If one person reads it and gets checked, I\u2019ll be happy. I grew up in the country and a lot of people fob it off. It\u2019s a \u2018she\u2019ll be right\u2019 attitude. Get the stuff checked out, it can make all the difference.\u201d\n\nAugust is back at the cafe with a grin on his face.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the park, a kick of the footy, and a slow, steady return to normal life for the Maddinson family.",

Source: SBS News ACTU assistant secretary Liam O'Brien said in a statement: \"Health and care workers, tradies, factory workers and the people who keep our communities safe are at the greatest risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One death at work is one too many, and our job is far from done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 146,700 serious workers' compensation claims involving at least one week or working time lost in 2023-2024 \u2014 more than 400 serious claims a day.\n\n\n\nWhat did the report find?\n\nSafe Work Australia's report found four sectors collectively made up more than half of the 146,700 serious workers' compensation claims in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose industry divisions were health care and social assistance (19.9 per cent), construction (12 per cent), manufacturing (10.1 per cent) and public administration and safety (9.2 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, those sectors only represented 36.3 per cent of filled jobs covered by a workers' compensation scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, across all industries, three in 10 injured workers reported receiving workers' compensation, while the rest either did not lodge a claim or did not receive compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACTU expressed alarm that seven in 10 injured workers were not receiving compensation, citing barriers in reporting and under-reporting that obscured the actual cost of workplace injuries across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it came to fatalities, machinery operators and drivers represented 61 worker deaths in 2024, with a rate of 6.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers. This was followed by labourers (50 fatalities), managers, technicians and trades workers (28 fatalities).\n\n\n\nIn 2024, machinery operators and drivers accounted for the highest proportion of worker fatalities (32 per cent) and also recorded the highest fatality rate at 6.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to the report. Source: SBS News The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry had a rate of 13.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2024, followed by transport, postal and warehousing (7.4 fatalities per 100,000 workers) and mining (3.4 fatalities per 100,000 workers).\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicle incidents were by far the most common cause of death at 42 per cent, and at least one vehicle was directly involved in the incident in 66 per cent of worker fatalities in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther causes of death included falls from a height (13 per cent), being hit by moving objects (9 per cent), being hit by falling objects (7 per cent), and being trapped by moving machinery or equipment or between stationary and moving objects (both 5 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers aged 45 and over accounted for more than half of worker fatalities recorded.\n\n\n\nMental health claims on the rise\n\nThe report also found that over the past decades, serious claims for mental health conditions have experienced the largest change across any major injury group, with a 161 per cent increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental stress is now the fourth most common cause of serious claims, at 11.5 per cent.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The $3.8 billion reason Australian workers would leave their jobs\n\nThe median time lost from serious claims related to mental stress is about five times the median time lost across all serious claims and leads to significantly more time off work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health claims also represented the costliest form of workplace injury \u2014 leading to more than four times the median compensation paid across all serious claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile men accounted for the vast majority of deaths (180) in 2024 and accounted for 58 per cent of all serious claims, the report found women's serious claims were more than twice as likely to involve mental health conditions as men's.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, women's claims also involved more time away from work. Median compensation paid for serious claims remains 20.4 per cent higher for men \u2014 $17,600 to $14,600.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACTU said unions were calling for greater legislative protection for workers who were exposed to psychosocial hazards on the job, such as violence and aggression, sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Brien said: \"Employers must treat work stress and intensification with the same seriousness as any other health and safety consideration.\"\n\n\n\n",

He said while the labour market is a \"lagging\" indicator, it does give us some insight into how the economy is tracking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen some green shoots in the broader economy in the activity indicators and consumer sentiment has picked up a little bit ... so it gave us a little bit of hope that the consumer and household sector more broadly would start to open their wallets and spend a little more,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's good for the economy and good for employment growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the rate of recovery is fairly measured. We're not seeing unambiguous signs of recovery, we're seeing tentative signs of recovery, and that's probably what's being reflected in the labour market.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO ASX hits record as jobless rate rises to 4.5% SBS News 09:25 English\n\nBefore the release of the unemployment numbers, Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock said employment was a little bit \"tight\", which broadly meant there were more jobs than available workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We look at a lot of different indicators of the labour market, so those two things [inflation and employment] suggest to us that maybe it's a little tight, but it's close to balance,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Joiner said the unemployment rate has \"ticked up above where the RBA thought it might be\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA has characterised the labour market as still somewhat tight,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They may need to reassess that somewhat in light of these numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This increase in the unemployment rate has taken the RBA a little bit by surprise and that will have to feed into the board's thinking on where policy settings should be.\"\n\n\n\nIs another interest rate cut on its way?\n\nSome economists have noted the shock jobless figures could pave the way for another interest rate cut in 2025, though they also expect the Reserve Bank to be \"conservative\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe higher jobless rate meant homeowners could get a mortgage reprieve soon, NAB senior markets economist Taylor Nugent said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today's outcome clearly makes a November cut a higher probability than would have been the case had today's number been near our and consensus expectations,\" he told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We continue to expect a hold as the RBA awaits more clarity on the outlook given the inherent month-to-month volatility.\"\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank economists continue to predict one more rate cut in this cycle, with February 2026 the base case. While they note that there's now a \"higher chance\" of a cut in November, they say sticky inflation may delay action.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank's head of Australian economics, Belinda Allen, said: \"This is a classic case of conflicting signals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Inflation has been a little stronger, consumer spending is rising, but employment growth has slowed more than expected. Until the tension between inflation and labour market is resolved, we expect the RBA to remain cautious and watchful of the data flow,\" she told AAP.\n\n\n\nFor Joiner, the figures are a sign the RBA will be in a \"bind\" and doesn't think it would cut rates at the next meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The unemployment rate is uncomfortably high for where the RBA expected it to be \u2026 The unemployment rate is rising, but inflation is also starting to potentially accelerate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It can't go into its November meeting saying the unemployment rate has risen, so let's cut rates immediately \u2014 it has to be concerned about the inflation outlook too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed the government is considering offshore recognition of skills to avoid lengthy wait times for migrants once they arrive in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 620,000 permanent migrants are working below their skill level in Australia, according to government figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burke made the comments during his first National Press Club address as home affairs minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the need for changes to the skilled migration program, Mr Burke says Australia is recognising an increasing number of skilled migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Last year, 21,000 visas for healthcare workers, 4300 visas for teachers, 15524 for construction, we have tripled the number of visas we're giving for construction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says it's necessary to give out that many visas to meet the need for skilled migrants in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If these are the areas where people want to cut, then they need to explain, which hospitals they're going to say don't have to fill every shift. Which education providers won't be - teaching the full range of subjects any more? Which construction projects are willing to wait longer for, including housing projects, if we're not going to have the labour we need to get them built.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burke also acknowledges there are challenges for the skilled migration system for migrants who have not acquired their visa through the employer sponsorship scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says his team is also working on the possibility of addressing the skills mismatch among migrants, that often leads many to work in other jobs, such as food delivery or Uber driving, rather than with their professional skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says recognising skills offshore, before migrants arrive in the country is one strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We haven't landed on it. This has been a wicked problem that no government has been able to solve in the lifetime of any of us. But it's something that if we can unlock this, then everybody wins. The economy wins, and the immigrant who is being given of a promise of what it will be like to work in Australia wins as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burke also announced he will close down a loophole in the migration system that's been fueling money laundering and crypto scams.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen international students leave Australia after graduation, their empty bank accounts can become what are called money mules, where criminals launder their money.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burke says he's approached universities for help to share the message with international students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our banks had to close 22,000 mule accounts being used in this way. Overseas students need to be told the fact that if you are offered to hand over your bank details, not only is it a crime - not only are you breaking the law in doing that, but you're also creating a situation where you are probably providing a means for child exploitation, for drug trafficking, for some of the worst elements of organised crime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a submission to the August Economic roundtable, advocacy group Activate Australia's Skills touched on the problems that industry and skilled migrants face in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group estimates that Australia's economy could grow by $9 billion every year or $25 million a day, if the skills of migrants were put to better use.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Burke's proposal for offshore skill recognition has also been welcomed by some in-demand industry groups, such as Master Builders Australia CEO Denita Wawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the government needs to attract roughly 100,000 extra workers for the country's construction needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Opposition leader Sussan Ley says there's still one issue around migration that Mr Burke hasn't addressed, and that's what she says is the high migration rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that is not the fault of any migrant or migrant community. I was a migrant to Australia, and I meet amazing migrants wherever I go. And I value contribution that they made. And the fact that they chose to come to Australia, we celebrate that every day. But let's not forget that this government allow a million migrants in a two-year period, much much higher than any two-year period in our history.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "If you can't find an affordable place to rent in a major city, should you move to a regional area?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the country continues to grapple with a housing affordability crisis and record-high rental prices, it's a question that many Australians face.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, moving away from a capital city can come with a range of potential sacrifices \u2014 from having to find new employment to being physically disconnected from one's family and community.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, finding an affordable rental in a regional area can also be gruelling, even for those working in some of the country's most essential industries \u2014 or so new research suggests.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, social advocacy group Anglicare Australia released its third annual snapshot of rental affordability for those it classified as essential workers, saying its results showed finding an affordable place to live was \"incredibly challenging\" for Australians in those fields.\n\n\n\n\n\nA companion to its long-running rental affordability snapshot, the report assessed more than 51,000 rental listings across the country, testing them for affordability across 16 essential worker categories.\n\n\n\nAmong those categories were workers in the hospitality, aged care, childcare and construction sectors, as well as cleaners, firefighters, meat packers, nurses and school teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordability was measured for a single person earning an adult full-time award wage for the relevant occupation.\n\n\n\nWhat did Anglicare's report find?\n\nAnglicare's report found negligible change across all essential worker categories over the last year, with very little change in affordability across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, there were sharp declines in affordability for teachers and social and community service workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 51,238 total listings surveyed, there were 417 affordable rentals for an early childhood educator, hospitality worker or nurse \u2014 0.8 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool teachers had the highest number of affordable rentals available to them \u2014 1,672, or 3.3 per cent \u2014 followed by firefighters at 1,651, or 3.2 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report emphasised that \"no part of Australia offers relief from the crisis\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFor hospitality workers, there were no affordable rentals among the listings in the ACT, five in the NT, and 80 across Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare's report found a cleaner would be able to afford less than 1 per cent of rental properties in the Southern Highlands or Hunter Valley in NSW, or in Central Queensland.\n\n\n\nAnglicare's report found a cleaner would be able to afford less than 1 per cent of rental properties in some regional parts of NSW and Queensland. Source: Getty / shironosov They would be able to afford less than 3 per cent in the regional Victorian city of Geelong, Cairns in Queensland, or in the outback regions of the NT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results, it said, disproved the \"myth\" that Australians struggling to find an affordable home in a capital city should simply move to a regional area where rent is cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said while many areas had experienced increases in affordability from last year, there were large swings in the opposite direction in others, with steep drops in outback Queensland and far-west NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare chief executive Kasy Chambers said the private rental market was \"failing\" many ordinary Australians, who she described as the country's \"backbone\" \u2014 those who performed the essential services required to keep it going.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the issue, she said, was widespread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Right across the country, there's nowhere basically where you have any good levels of affordability,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Wanted: Essential workers in regional Australia SBS News 06:22 English\n\nChambers said that, while most people would assume the private rental market should serve \"middle Australia\", the report's findings showed it wasn't doing that.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lack of affordable rentals can also compound other cost-of-living pressures and scarce job opportunities, issues felt more intensely the further away one is from a major city, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're finding that more and more we're having to actually provide housing to get workers, particularly to regional areas in aged care and things like that,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAre rents still cheaper in regional areas?\n\nWhether they fall into the category of 'affordable' or not, median rents are still lower in regional parts of the country compared to the capital cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty group Domain's rental report for September showed typical weekly rent across the combined capital cities was $650, dropping down to $585 a week across the combined regional areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-on-year, Australia's regional areas collectively experienced a 6.4 per cent increase in median rents, rising from $550 in September 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain senior economist Joel Bowman said the \"growth momentum\" of rental prices was slowing in both capital cities and regional areas, but was doing so from a slightly higher level in the regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we're looking at the most recent quarters, there are clear signs that rent growth is still slowing in the regional pockets by and large,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\"For example, in regional New South Wales, regional South Australia and regional Western Australia, the median rents for houses did not grow in the September quarter compared to the June quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the annual growth is still coming off that higher rate, given that we did see notable increases last year. But they're starting to wash through. I think, by and large, affordability constraints are really capping the extent to which rents can increase in both the capital cities and the regions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBowman said the slowdown was not due to supply, as vacancy rates remained very low across the board, including in regional pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said landlords were struggling to increase rents, as renters were simply unable to pay for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's really those affordability elements that I think are capping those rent increases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, though, unaffordable rentals will still be out of reach for the many in \"ordinary\" industries who are unable to pay for them \u2014 regardless of whether they're cheaper than their equivalents in capital cities.\n\n\n\nWhat can be done about unaffordable rentals?\n\nChambers pointed to several issues she said were contributing to a lack of affordability, including the precarious nature of housing for those in the private rental sector, meaning many renters moved house far more often than would be desirable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare's report called for stronger protections for renters and, in particular, a consistent national approach rather than the \"patchwork of different rental laws\" between states and territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nChambers said uncoupling wages from the private rental market was also necessary, as wage growth had failed to keep up with the cost of housing.\n\n\n\nHowever, while Anglicare's report suggested several possible solutions for addressing Australia's rental affordability issue, it said those would do little without taxation reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt called for an overhaul of Australia's tax system, including a phasing out of the Capital Gains Tax discount over the next 10 years, and a phasing out of negative gearing deductions for new investors in the private market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without reforming these incentives, other solutions will be piecemeal efforts,\" it said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed the government is considering offshore recognition of skills to avoid lengthy wait times for migrants once they arrive in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 620,000 permanent migrants are working below their skill level in Australia, according to government figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany who travel to Australia with in-demand skill sets report finding the process of having their qualifications recognised lengthy, expensive and confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis often leads them to work in other jobs, such as food delivery or Uber driving, far from home support during the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his first National Press Club address as home affairs minister on Thursday, Burke said the government is \"working through\" the possibility of offshore recognition or further training.\n\n\n\n\"There's conversations about exactly that. I've had partner countries raise that with me as well,\" Burke said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenge is to find which of the careers and skill sets you could train for that don't require a practical.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained that the government would have to either be confident that the qualification doesn't require an onshore practical assessment or provide offshore training that meets the necessary standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it was all part of the discussions the government is \"working our way through\", stopping short of making any announcement.\n\n\n\nHowever, Burke noted that those who arrive in Australia on sponsored visas, with employment already lined up, do not face these barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This has been a wicked problem that no government has been able to solve in the lifetime of any of us,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we can unlock this, then everybody wins. The economy wins, and the immigrant who is being given a promise of what it will be like to work in Australia wins as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its submission to the August economic roundtable, Activate Australia's Skills estimated the nation's economy could grow by $9 billion every year or $25 million a day, if the skills of migrants were put to better use.\n\n\n\n\n\nActivate Australia's Skills is an alliance campaign of businesses, unions, social services and community groups pushing a skills and qualifications recognition policy.\n\n\n\nWhat industries could the government target first?\n\nFelix Pirie, CEO of the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia, noted several sectors could benefit from offshore recognition to expedite the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is the capacity for some qualifications to be delivered offshore and recognised in Australia, where the additional elements required for Australia are delivered by Australian providers in an offshore context,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are already independent skills training providers delivering qualifications in hospitality, aged care, early learning and so on, in places like the Philippines, in Indonesia, and they're delivering Australian qualifications in those places, and those graduates from those qualifications are ready and able to come to Australia and work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPirie described the suggestion as a \"really positive thing\", but stressed the government \"can't lose sight of the need to have students in Australia supporting our international education sector\".\n\n\n\nIn their 2024 report, Master Builders Australia estimated migrants in construction faced an average 18 months' wait and $10,000 bill to have their skills recognised.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster Builders Australia CEO Denita Wawn told SBS News she welcomed proposed changes to skilled migration, estimating the government needs to attract roughly 100,000 extra workers for construction needs, including building the National Housing Accord target of 1.2 million homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The building and construction industry is facing skills shortages that can't be filled domestically alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We welcome any discussions with government about how we reduce the costs and long wait times skilled migrants face to have their experience and qualifications recognised without comprising on standards.\"\n\n\n\n",

You need the correct corn for your tortillas, find the right amount \u2013 and type \u2013 of chillies, get your crisp right. You don\u2019t want to make your consomme too watery or too oily. Birria Boy\u2019s Andy Ashby. Morgan Roberts For something so casual and one-handed to eat, a lot goes into the preparation and cooking. You suspect it\u2019s why some of the birria you encounter around town is so often bland and under-seasoned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndy Ashby describes the process as a labour of love. Related Article Brisbane\u2019s best sandwiches? Here are our top picks of the past year \u201cIt comes down to understanding the culture and getting the correct ingredients,\u201d Ashby says. \u201cWe\u2019re not just picking chilli off the shelf. We\u2019re getting them imported from Mexico and going correctly down those channels and getting the right varieties, because they all have different properties. \u201cIf you don\u2019t respect what birria is and give it that time that it needs to just breathe and do its thing, you\u2019re bastardising the culture of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Mexican, so I wouldn\u2019t want to make any claims to authenticity, but that just means I need to do more R&D, not less.\u201d Crispy birria tacos are the main draw at Birria Boy. Morgan Roberts Know what else is hard? Running a restaurant at the Mater Hill end of Stanley Street in Woolloongabba. It\u2019s a beautiful heritage set of buildings, but also in a weird no man\u2019s land when it comes to nearby residential areas that can act as regular patronage. But Ashby has made it work with C\u2019est Bon, which, since he took the reins in 2020, has slowly built a reputation as one of the city\u2019s best French restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s that skill with French food, one of the so-called \u201cmother\u201d cuisines, that Ashby has applied to Birria Boy, his new Mexican pop-up that will open in the former Clarence space, next door to C\u2019est Bon. The Birria Boy menu is short and sharp and includes an $18 margarita. Morgan Roberts \u201cI think so,\u201d Ashby says. \u201cFrench cuisine has so many layers. When we go to make a nice consomme, say, there are essential foundations to that process. \u201cYou apply that same methodology, but obviously with different ingredients. Right now, I\u2019ve a mole negro and a mole rojo on the stove right now. These bad boys will maybe be going off for up to 10 hours. \u201cBut it\u2019s that fundamental building aspect that I\u2019ve learned throughout my career and I\u2019m taking across to Birria Boy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been some cosmetic touch-ups to the old Clarence space on Stanley Street. Morgan Roberts Birria Boy\u2019s menu is, as you\u2019d expect for a pop-up, pretty straightforward and makes use of the venue\u2019s wood-fired oven \u2013 a relic from its Vespa Pizza days that remained dormant during the Clarence years. The taco menu includes three birria tacos \u2013 a signature wagyu beef, a goat (the traditional meat for birria) and a mushroom \u2013 all served on housemade masa flour tortillas. There are also two regular tacos \u2013 a duck carnitas and a tempura king prawn. There\u2019s also a clutch of larger plates cooked on wood fire, including pork neck, chicken asado and cod cooked in banana leaf, with all served with tortillas and sauces. Ashby is making use of the wood-fired oven not used since the premises\u2019 Vespa Pizza days. Morgan Roberts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, it\u2019s a bunch of snacks \u2013 corn ribs, chicharrones, a torched avocado guacamole, that kind of thing \u2013 and a few sides. For drinks, there are cocktails \u2013 including an $18 house margarita \u2013 built on high-quality mezcals such as Bozal and Lost Explorer, Mexican beers, and a selection of other spirits. There\u2019s also BYO wine for $20 corkage per bottle. The fit-out remains much the same as the Clarence days, split across two of the heritage brick-walled tenancies in the old Shop Row building on Stanley Street, but Ashby has given it a liberal splash of red paint in places, and installed black tiling behind the open kitchen out front, finishing it with a neon sign that reads \u201cMexican\u201d, just in case you were in any doubt about what this place is all about. Birria Boy will open Thursday to Monday each week. Morgan Roberts Ashby says it\u2019s meant to be fun and fancy-free \u2013 the kind of thing you can dip into before or after a game at the Gabba or a show at the Princess Theatre around the corner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we look after that crowd that goes to the game or a show at the Princess,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little love on the plate. \u201cMexican has come such a long way in this city and it\u2019s also about paying respect to guys who have really pushed it along, like Mama Taco [in West End] or Dan [Quinn] from Baja \u2013 he\u2019s been so diligent just in terms of giving me some direction, which has been awesome. \u201cThat\u2019s what hospitality is all about.\u201d Open Thu 4pm-late; Fri-Sun 11.30am-2pm, 4pm-late; Mon 4pm-late. 617 Stanley Street, Woolloongabba. birriaboy.com.au\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Racing NSW and the ATC were at odds ahead of The Everest carnival over the terms of a deal to establish Base Camp, a new $7 million trackside corporate enclosure driven by V\u2019landys, which has been set up in such a rush that building work is expected to continue through Friday night. The sacking of ATC chief executive Matt Galanos then set off a chain of events that led to a sensational public admonishment of the club by Racing NSW chair Saranne Cooke, technically V\u2019landys\u2019 boss, who warned there were \u201csignificant doubts about its ability to survive without ongoing bailouts\u201d. Australian Turf Club chairman Tim Hale argues the member-owned organisation is financially secure. Credit: Steven Siewert Two club directors quit, with one going public with claims of dysfunction on the board, leaving only four remaining \u2013 Hale, media personality Caroline Searcy, technology executive and horse owner David McGrath, and Annette English, a commercial lawyer with close ties to the breeding industry. Three of them were opposed to the controversial proposed $5 billion sale of Rosehill for housing, which triggered a parliamentary inquiry last year before ultimately being defeated by members in May.\n\nThe Racing NSW intervention has brought the sport\u2019s complex, much-debated flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in wagering revenue into back into focus. Most of it lands in the coffers of Racing NSW, which straddles the roles of both regulator and commercial juggernaut, distributing money onwards but also accumulating a war chest that includes $150 million in property. V\u2019landys told last year\u2019s Rosehill inquiry an extra $3 billion had been injected into the industry thanks to Racing NSW\u2019s 2012 High Court win that made the bookies pay up and as a result of its negotiations with the state government on betting-related taxes. Last year\u2019s Everest day was attended by a record crowd of 49,117. Credit: Getty \u201cThis is all new money. Racing NSW\u2019s initiatives have made the money and now some want the keys to the castle,\u201d he said in a written presentation to inquiry committee members. Hale says these are \u201cindustry funds\u201d and much of what is channelled to the club from Racing NSW is earmarked for prizemoney and bonuses paid directly to owners rather than for the club\u2019s operating costs.\n\nV\u2019landys told this masthead the club\u2019s costs had soared and it was not generating enough of its own revenue. \u201cWhatever way you look at it, we\u2019re giving them a lot more money than we\u2019ve ever given them,\u201d he said. With the blowtorch on ATC\u2019s governance, including unspecified alleged code of conduct breaches by directors, eyebrows have also been raised about how Racing NSW has conducted itself. Just this week, the NSW parliament\u2019s privileges committee delivered it a slapdown for its behaviour during the Rosehill inquiry, while this masthead earlier this year reported how Cooke transferred a block of land near Bathurst racecourse to Racing NSW for $1 after buying it in her own name. It also emerged at the inquiry that Racing NSW did not have a human resources department, but a \u201cHR function\u201d carried out by general managers. Cooke said at the time there was nothing inappropriate about the land deal, on which stamp duty was paid by Racing NSW. V\u2019landys maintained the organisation was just defending itself with letters sent to the Rosehill inquiry that included allegations of impropriety against former staff it believed were behind confidential evidence about Racing NSW.\n\nMark Latham, a perennial thorn in V\u2019landys\u2019 side, has been Racing NSW\u2019s loudest detractor but in the strangest of twists has become an ally of sorts in the ATC affair \u2013 if only of the enemy-of-your-enemy-is-your-friend kind. Furious at being banned from the club\u2019s tracks over a run-in with club executive Steve McMahon and thrown out of Randwick a fortnight ago, the Independent MP has branded Hale as \u201cJellyfish Tim\u201d, saying he hopes the board is sacked. As for V\u2019landys himself, there have been fresh questions from industry critics about dual roles as racing\u2019s boss and a hands-on chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission, specifically about how much attention he can devote to his full-time job when he is in charge of two major sports. After more than two decades atop racing, his future has been the subject of much speculation. The latest rumour spreading like wildfire is that he will run the Brisbane Olympic Games in 2032. V\u2019landys doesn\u2019t know how it got started \u2013 \u201cno one has contacted me\u201d \u2013 and there is nothing to indicate there is any basis to it.",

The Herald visited two of the main accommodation options for the Chiefs Village.\n\nHowever, before they can do that, one of the greatest obstacles confronting the Chiefs will be convincing players and their families they will be safe within the country.\n\nThere are bold ambitions to begin talking to players in the coming weeks, plans to pursue Ivan and Nathan Cleary, and predictions of what could be the most valuable jersey in the NRL.\n\nThe Chiefs name was unveiled in Port Moresby last weekend, with the Herald invited to sit in on key meetings, tour potential accommodation and interview key stakeholders.\n\nThe NRL and the PNG Chiefs have begun selling the tax-free dream, revealing their plans to lure players and their families to Papua New Guinea from the end of 2027.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of people in PNG and the reputation is bad, but the reality is not like that,\u201d Chiefs board member and former ARL Commission director Catherine Harris said.\n\nThere is an undertaking from the resort owners to build 80 villas that would house the NRL players and their families before they arrive for pre-season training at the end of 2027, ahead of their entry into the competition in 2028.\n\nThe facility has a tennis court, basketball court, playground, swimming pools, beauty salon, squash courts, restaurants, gym and its own medical centre.\n\nThe appeal of the 11-hectare facility is the available green space and facilities that would be more appealing to families than high-rise apartment and hotel complexes.\n\nThe resort is next to the international airport and fenced off from the outside world.\n\nComplete with its own private island and overwater bungalows just 15 minutes off the coast of Port Moresby, the Airways Resort is the preferred player village of the Australian Rugby League Commission.\n\nThe other option the NRL is considering is the harbour front Marriott apartments. There is vacant land on the water for a purpose-built accommodation facility.\n\n\u201cOne is for families to come out here during the week. The mothers can take the kids and come out for the day. It\u2019s also a great overnight island, so they can come here with their partners or when family members come over to visit during the season. It\u2019s a great place to break the monotony of staying in the players\u2019 and staff village.\u201d\n\nLoloata Island is privately owned by the Airways Resort and will be available to players and families. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cI think this island can work two ways,\u201d Chiefs chairman Ray Dib said.\n\nAs part of the deal, players and their families will have access to the Loloata Island resort.\n\n\u201cEverybody is so conscious about security, it\u2019s almost safer because everyone is so conscious of it. It\u2019s like working in a workforce where safety is really important. You feel safe. It\u2019s the same here in PNG.\u201d\n\nThe other major appeal of the Marriott Apartments is the indoor-outdoor mezzanine level, which is being dubbed \u201cNRL House\u201d and is being offered as a private facility for players and their families.\n\nThe pool overlooking the harbour in the existing Marriott building being offered to the NRL. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been going there, I\u2019ve never witnessed or experienced any concerns. But there\u2019s obviously places where you don\u2019t go after dark, or you [don\u2019t] drive down certain streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, safety is a priority,\u201d Dib said. \u201cSome years ago, I took my wife and my daughter there when we built a school with the Bulldogs there. They never had a concern.\n\nThis is a concern for the NRL despite the appeal of a waterfront location and new facilities adjacent to a fast-developing CBD.\n\nWhile the harbour front precinct has a heavy security presence, it\u2019s not separated from the outside world.\n\nThe harbourside site owned by the Marriott which is being considered as the site for the Chiefs\u2019 accommodation village. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question about that. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be doing this. But it\u2019s long term, and it requires investment now. And the long-term gains are that as this country develops and as the ecosystem develops, there are a number of revenue drivers or spin-offs from it.\n\n\u201cIt is going to diversify, strengthen, and grow the game\u2019s whole of game revenues,\u201d he said.\n\nBut NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo hit back at suggestions the league was out of its depth with this project.\n\nIt is viewed in some quarters as a $600 million gift from the government to the NRL, leaving some pundits sceptical of the PNG team\u2019s place in the competition.\n\nMost see this venture as a geopolitical power play.\n\nThe third option is the Hilton Hotel; however, a lack of green space and its location are expected to be deterrents.\n\nPapua New Guinea fans at PM XIII game in Port Moresby. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cOne thing we do know about sporting clubs is that they are becoming increasingly more valuable. So, we are creating a franchise that will one day in the future, in the near future, have a value of somewhere between 50 and $100 million.\u201d\n\nDib echoed that sentiment, predicting high sponsorship revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with sponsorship over in PNG and in Australia,\u201d Dib said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised by the number of international brands that will be on our jersey. Money won\u2019t be an issue for us. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be at the top.\u201d\n\nHow will the Chiefs attract big-name players?\n\nDib held the role of chairman at the Canterbury Bulldogs during a successful period when they reached grand finals in 2012 and 2014.\n\nHe knows players are unlikely to sign long-term contracts to join the Chiefs, but believes the financial perks could represent the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic. I\u2019m confident once we get them there, and they see the facilities and what we have in mind, the vision that Peter [V\u2019landys, ARL Commission chairman] and Andrew have got for the franchise ... that they\u2019ll be able to enjoy the period and also gain financially and academically,\u201d Dib said.\n\nRay Dib and Andrew Abdo on their way out to visit Loloata Island.

Let\u2019s be honest, the players have got a limited lifespan in rugby league.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a young bloke starting out, you want an opportunity to play in the NRL and maximise your minimum [early career] salary, that\u2019s got to be an attraction. If you\u2019re a player coming towards retirement, if you haven\u2019t really established a great asset base, it\u2019s a place that might help you in the last couple of years of your career.\u201d\n\nHas the tax-free incentive been signed off?\n\nThe Australian government is yet to sign off on the promised income tax exemption, but Abdo says the players have nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely tax-free in PNG,\u201d Abdo said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the process of confirming the exemption for ensuring that non-resident Australians aren\u2019t taxed in Australia.\n\nNRL CEO Andrew Abdo addressed the PNG Chiefs board last week. Credit: NRL Photos\n\n\u201cThe legislation exists already, and it\u2019s really just around formalising that through the actual package that will be offered to these individuals.\u201d\n\nResidents of other countries will not be entitled to the exemption as the deal is between the Australian and PNG governments.\n\nAs a result, New Zealand and England residents will not be financially advantaged by joining the Chiefs, reducing the potential player pool.\n\nWhich players are the Chiefs chasing?\n\nThe Chiefs are set to approach the NRL to request that they be allowed to sign players from November 1 this year.\n\nThe club doesn\u2019t want to wait until this time next year to begin building its roster and is keen to try and convince players to join the Chiefs two years before they enter the competition.\n\nThat would require a player to agree to a contract for 2028 and sign a one-year deal for 2027 with another club.\n\nPayne Haas is a free agent as of November 1. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe would be crazy not to engage [with players], but I just need to speak to the NRL about it and whether we\u2019re allowed to sign future contracts if they are free agents,\u201d Dib said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have a discussion very soon about. That would be an ideal position [to talk to players from November 1 this year]. If we can do that then yeah, absolutely we should be doing that.\n\n\u201cIf the NRL say we can do that and the player is willing to play with someone else in the interim, we\u2019d be crazy not to see what\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nThat would put Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, Payne Haas, Luke Metcalf, Jayden Campbell, Harry Grant and Liam Henry firmly on the Chiefs\u2019 radar.\n\nV\u2019landys has also made no secret of his desire to lure Wayne Bennett to Papua New Guinea.\n\nNathan Cleary celebrates with his father and coach Ivan Cleary.

His partner, Mary Fowler, has Papua New Guinean heritage.\n\nThe stadium and centre of excellence\n\nSantos National Stadium will be the Chiefs\u2019 home base, with plans in place to upgrade the venue\u2019s capacity from 15,000 to 20,000.\n\nThe site for the PNG first grade training field and centre of excellence is right next to the existing stadium that will be used as the team\u2019s home ground. Construction is expected to commence in the new year.\n\nOutside the $600 million Australian government investment that goes to the NRL, the PNG government has pledged to invest in the upgrade of the stadium and a nearby centre of excellence.\n\nThe Chiefs are building a temporary office inside the stadium grandstand, but will move to the centre of excellence which is expected to rival the facilities used by the Parramatta Eels and North Queensland Cowboys.\n\nWhat are some of the other challenges?\n\nGiven the year-round high temperatures and humidity, night matches would provide more suitable conditions when the Chiefs play at home.\n\nFans at the match between the PM\u2019s XIII and PNG in Port Moresby.

THEATRE\n\nMEOW MEOW\u2019S THE RED SHOES\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, October 15, until November 9\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 A fright wig and false eyelashes can only take you so far. From the time she clawed her way into our hearts nearly 25 years ago, Meow Meow backed up the ditsy exterior trappings in her cabaret shows with a striking singing voice and a zany, gloriously unpredictable stage persona. Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes is a cat of a different colour. She has presented shows derived from Hans Christian Andersen before, reimagining The Little Mermaid and The Little Match Girl. If her Red Shoes, here having its premiere season, happily has no girl\u2019s dancing feet being chopped off, it does feel like it was shooed into the rehearsal room with director Kate Champion while only a kitten\u2019s fetus. Kanen Breen and Meow Meow in Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes. Credit: Brett Boardman\n\nNot a play, it\u2019s a cabaret show with themes of red shoes and greed, lovingly wrapped in improbably juxtaposed songs, ranging from what I presume was her own Why Must There Be an Opening Number? to Radiohead\u2019s No Surprises and Patrick Watson\u2019s Here Comes a River. These are expertly performed with singer Kanen Breen, pianist Mark Jones, bassist Dan Witton and guitarist/percussionist Jethro Woodward, who also become props and characters. Meow, of course, is the main event. To begin, she\u2019s dragged on stage comatose: the eternal show girl, now loath to perform. Then she sings, dances, talks, improvises, climbs things, dies, eats a sandwich, dresses, undresses, pumps the bellows of a harmonium with her foot and even pinches audience members\u2019 handbags and clothing. Yet after a while \u2013 and it only last 75 minutes \u2013 I was thinking that there was something richer and darker to be mined from The Red Shoes than this; that there\u2019s too much surface and not enough substance. The show unfolds as a series of songs interlinked by the \u201cred shoes\u201d theme. Credit: Brett Boardman Don\u2019t get me wrong: her singing can still be glorious and her sheer zaniness intoxicating. In the latter regard, she\u2019s something of a throwback to the Dada movement of a century ago, with meaning less important than surprising images and songs. But the Meow Meow who can be achingly funny was missing too often, with not much to replace it. She laments the failure of communism in its \u201call for one and one for all\u201d sense, delightfully reimagines Hamlet as a Eurovision song and quizzes Andersen (Breen) about his layered meanings in The Red Shoes. Little illumination results (although the meaning of Andersen\u2019s tale is very much in the reader\u2019s mind). Nothing is explicit \u2013 and that\u2019s, no doubt, the point of the show. But here her theatrical version of chaos theory needs another layer, whether of humour or narrative, or there\u2019s a slight feeling of the empress having insufficient clothes (despite multiple costume changes). Perhaps Champion needed to be a more rigorous director to help distil something beyond random flights of fancy. Meow is so innately gifted, captivating and, above all, audacious, but here it\u2019s just not quite enough.\n\nMUSIC\n\nTEDDY SWIMS\n\nQudos Bank Arena, October 14\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Finding galaxies of love under tattooed eyelids, and a kingly swagger in white socks riding free on stocky legs, the cuddly American gangster of self-acceptance and soul took Sydney right up to the heavenly high he\u2019s on in his healing journey, with big-budget pyrotechnics to match those big-belted feels. Since the breakout success of I\u2019ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1) in 2023, with its heavyweight hits about toxic co-dependency, addiction and heartbreak, Teddy Swims has come a long way. He\u2019s been to therapy, for one. He\u2019s also found love again, the wholesome kind. Plus, with global tours and billions of streams, the former YouTube cover artist sure is making bank. Teddy Swims with band Freaky Feely at Qudos Bank Arena. Credit: Glenn Pokorny/Qudos Bank Arena \u201cI\u2019m so grateful towards my shitty ex-girlfriend,\u201d he joked good-heartedly to a packed arena. Though Teddy still pays tribute to (Part 1), tucking a few of the best into the encore, this tour is a celebration in the spirit of 2025\u2019s (Part 2), where he\u2019s come out of all that pain to a place he couldn\u2019t have imagined a few years back: enormous gratitude.\n\nSydney is his first Australian tour stop, but his second October show, having won hearts in a kilt at the NRL Grand Finals. Still with Freaky Feely backing \u2013 the high school band he\u2019s brought with him on the up and up \u2013 it\u2019s a two-hour-long theatre of the full second album tracklist, and then some. A natural performer, we see Teddy crooning Bad Dreams into a mic stand shaped like a voluptuous woman, going back to the raw place with Some Things I\u2019ll Never Know, getting tender with Small Hands devoted to his new baby boy, crowd-pleasing at the close with Lose Control. It\u2019s a powerful, oaky, aching voice: soaked in decades of smoke and liquor; trained on YouTube clips, high school musicals and Atlanta area bands; and set on its god-gifted course to slow-burning stardom by a sweetheart dad who introduced him to the likes of Al Green. The production gives him the panache he deserves, while showing his sense of humour. At one point, following rolling fog and shooting flames, we see Teddy reappear on the summit of a golden ramp on a dunny throne from a hidden trapdoor. Wardrobe whirls him through a white cowboy suit, a tarot-patterned silk robe, a black T and shorts, and a creamy trench coat. Shoes? When you\u2019re that grounded, who needs \u2019em. It\u2019s no wonder audiences adore him: an everyman shot to pop firmaments on true talent, ribbing and relishing the trappings of class. A role model for a generation leaning into the strength of vulnerability, it\u2019s big love all round. THEATRE\n\nTHE SHIRALEE\n\nDrama Theatre, October 10\n\nUntil November 29\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nA deep sense of mythology surrounds the reader in D\u2019Arcy Niland\u2019s 1955 novel, The Shiralee. It\u2019s as if the very landscape of mid-20th-century Australia is misanthropic, while those inhabiting it can be as deadly as brown snakes. In adapting the novel, playwright Kate Mulvany and director Jessica Arthur (for Sydney Theatre Company) have been aware of this quality, but they\u2019ve only partially succeeded in transmitting it through their production. Too often this feels like a musical minus the songs: as gooey as a box of chocolates in the sun when attempting warmth of heart, and a little lame and stagy when shooting for menace. Kate Mulvany, Ziggy Resnick and Josh McConville in The Shiralee for the Sydney Theatre Company. Credit: Prudence Upton Niland\u2019s novel tells of Mac, an itinerant jack-of-all-trades, who arrives back in Sydney to find his wife in bed with another bloke. Mac sorts out the bloke with his fists, and his wife by taking their daughter, Buster, and hitting the road. It\u2019s a tale of a little girl adoring her remote, belligerent father, and gradually wearing away his armoured outer layer, almost as slowly as water acts on stone. Given the limitations of child actors, Buster is now nine rather than four, which shifts the dynamic considerably, as a four-year-old is obviously more helpless and dependent. Mulvany uses this shift to craft a more knowing, perceptive and wily Buster, and then Arthur has cast the notable Ziggy Resnick in the role. Although over a dozen years older than Buster, Resnick locates the truth of the bashfulness, eagerness, playfulness, bewilderment, humour, earnestness and staunch morality.\n\nZiggy Resnick and Josh McComville with Paul Capsis (centre) as Desmond the bush poet. Credit: Prudence Upton Mulvany also makes Buster more influential and more evenly matched in size of role with Mac, played by Josh McConville. McConville is convincing as the bluff, taciturn man who solves money problems with his sweat, and people problems with his fists. Tempered like steel in a forge, he is loath to let this slip of a girl, this shiralee (or burden) change his pugnacious, self-absorbed life. Niland peoples his novel with vivid incidental characters, and a further six actors assume multiple roles, including Mulvany herself playing Marge, Buster\u2019s mother, whom she makes more rounded and sympathetic now she\u2019s not just being seen through Mac\u2019s eyes. Aaron Pedersen and Josh McConville in The Shiralee. Credit: Prudence Upton Paul Capsis is ideal as the superbly eccentric Desmond, a cycling swaggie and published bush poet. He (as do most of the minor characters) offers flickers of illumination to the protagonists, especially Buster, who is photographic paper in this regard compared with Mac\u2019s carbon paper. Stephen Anderson, Lucia Mastrantone, Aaron Pedersen and Catherine Van-Davies complete the cast.\n\nUnlike the book, the story is told chronologically, which perhaps partly undermines that mythic quality: time is now linear rather than looped. But Jeremy Allen\u2019s set bolsters the mythology, expertly using the Drama Theatre\u2019s widescreen stage, while Jessica Dunn\u2019s music amplifies the sense of space, foreboding and starry-skied wonderment. Alas, they can\u2019t help the fact that when the play swerves back towards naturalism, it should be woven from grittier fabric. MUSIC\n\nHARRY BENNETTS PERFORMS BEETHOVEN\u2019S VIOLIN CONCERTO\n\nSydney Symphony Orchestra, City Recital Hall, October 9\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Harry Bennetts played Beethoven\u2019s Violin Concerto with a sweet sound, fine line and nuanced care, allowing the work\u2019s beauties to unfold lyrically without false drama or undue storminess. Conductor Umberto Clerici began the opening orchestral tutti with unhurried gentleness. There was no hint of spikiness when the string parts took up the quiet opening drum beats, and the phrases breathed in long lines, moving with the breadth and inevitability of a noble river. Harry Bennetts, conductor Umberto Clerici and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Sydney Symphony Orchestra\n\nWhen Bennetts took up the solo entry, it was not with the swagger of a virtuoso driven by posturing heroics, but rather with a focus on allowing the work\u2019s intricacies to blossom with precision and clarity. In the codetta section, as the orchestra starts to surge, Bennett twice responded to the challenge with aptly projected vigour, but on the third, took on the Orphean task of taming them with quiet calm. In the development section, when the soloist brings back the opening theme in B minor, high in the violin\u2019s range, Bennetts created a memorable moment of transparent expressiveness without excess. The cadenza of the first movement (by Joachim) held attention with its even, unpressed resonance, contrapuntal clarity, glowing tone and true intonation without a hint of roughness or unwanted bow noise. All of this, of course, requires some freedom with the tempo which, for me, was slightly overdone in the Coda. The slow movement captured a sense of fresh stillness, Bennett ornamenting the underlying orchestral theme with balanced ornamentation of silvery brightness. I occasionally found the sense of pulse in the orchestral playing floated so freely it almost dissolved. The finale had beguiling buoyancy from both soloist and conductor. After another finely polished cadenza and exuberant Coda, Bennett started the last arpeggio with hushed insouciance as though beginning a new episode before the orchestra emphatically stopped any further discussion. In the second half Clerici and the Sydney Symphony again emphasised gentle lyricism in Schubert\u2019s Symphony No. 4 in C minor, D. 417 Tragic. The first movement was fretful and agitated (\u2018Tragic\u2019 as a subtitle has always seemed a little overblown) and the second gracious. In the third movement, Clerici and the SSO played Schubert\u2019s cross-accents to create a sense of poised ambiguity. The finale was neat and discursive, as the young Schubert (he was only 19) was prone to be.\n\nDANCE\n\nTHE BOGONG\u2019S SONG: A CALL TO COUNTRY\n\nBangarra Studio Theatre, October 9, until October 19\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN (with James and Teddy Gribble, and Charlie Price)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nMy co-reviewers Jamie (aged eight), his brother Teddy and their cousin Charlie (both aged six) didn\u2019t even make it to their seats before being captivated by the moody blue uplighting at Bangarra Studio Theatre. It was a foretaste of the atmospheric vibe of Bangarra Dance Theatre\u2019s school holiday show The Bogong\u2019s Song by Yolande Brown and Chenoa Deemal, for ages five plus. It tells the story of siblings Beau and Myee (played by Benjin Maza and Tjilala Brown-Roberts, both fabulous triple threats). They are dream-transported to ancestral Country in the Snowy Mountains, where they must find a missing Bogong moth, healing the land and their own hearts along the way. \u201cThey were in sync like all the time when they danced!\u201d Jamie observed. Benjin Maza and Tjilala Brown-Roberts in The Bogong\u2019s Song. Credit: Edwina Pickles The Bogong\u2019s Song features pretty much everything you could think of for a children\u2019s production. There\u2019s acting, singing, rapping, animated backgrounds, talking trees, hand-held puppets, shadow puppets, sing-alongs, and dancing. While the pacing can be patchy and the narrative occasionally lags, enough happens to keep things rolling. And the animal characters are a hit. \u201cI liked the possum and the baby possum!\u201d enthused Teddy. \u201cI liked the lizard,\u201d responds Charlie. \u201cHe was funny because he said he would eat the moth but then he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nJamie agreed. \u201cHe was hilarious! He used a chip packet as a solar panel!\u201d There are also heartfelt lessons. \u201cIt was about helping the endangered moths,\u201d explained Jamie. \u201c[The siblings] needed to connect with Country, which meant listening to Country and the land. It made me feel good, but a little bit sad for how the world was treated.\u201d Teddy nodded thoughtfully: \u201cThey were trying to not let the worlds separate.\u201d The Bogong\u2019s Song also grapples with Australia\u2019s shockingly young age of criminal responsibility, as Beau and Myee grieve the imprisonment of their deaf little brother Joey. That part, recounted Jamie, is \u201cvery, very sad\u201d. \u201cHe stole lollies. He went to jail. And he was 10. He was confused and scared. Couldn\u2019t he just get a fine?\u201d\n\nThe high point is the finale, featuring an all-too-short traditional dance featuring ochre paint and didgeridoo music. This part has no wisecracking animals or cartoons, but its power is immediately palpable. The children in the audience become transfixed, completely still and silent, as if responding to some deep, ancient summons that cuts through all the screens, lights, and noise. MUSIC\n\nTHE TALLIS SCHOLARS\n\nSydney Opera House, October 12\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Tallis Scholars began their eleventh Australian tour with a glowing, subtly invigorated sound of rich density and iridescent edge in the splendid eight-part motet Deus in adiutorium by the 17th century Spanish/Mexican composer Juan Gutierrez de Padilla. In an interview earlier in the day, director and founder of the Tallis Scholars, Peter Phillips, gave some insight into what gives this doyen of Renaissance vocal ensembles its distinctive tonal quality which is so elusive to describe yet instantly loved by audiences worldwide. He spoke of the micro-refinements of tuning that singers undertake when singing without instruments. Equally important, of course, is the talent, dedication and professionalism of the singers and, in Phillips\u2019 case, 53 years of experience in refining and perfecting the Tallis Scholars to lay bare the glories of the Renaissance with transparent clarity.\n\nListening closely to the vibrant chords of Padilla\u2019s work, one can hear, beyond the purity of tone and pitch, small harmonics of the sort one hears in singing from Bulgaria to Tibet that add shafts of colour and engender delight. The program was built around the theme of chant which appeared in beguiling simplicity in the next work, in principio by 12th century abbess, Hildegard of Bingen, sung by a sub-group of female singers with disarming naturalness of line and rhythm. A more recent adaptation of chant-based melodic and polyphonic structures was then presented in Arvo Part\u2019s Triodion, written for the 150th anniversary of Lancing College in Sussex, England. A different range of harmonics emerged in the halos of Part\u2019s delicately soft blends of humming, solo and widely spaced voices, leading to a still central point that even a fretful baby in the audience could not disturb. After another chant by Hildegard the first half concluded with the substantial motet by Jacob Obrecht, Salve Regina, in which varying groupings of the 10 voices coalesced and mutated to create a sense of timeless calm. To start the second half, the singers split into widely separated groups for Allegri\u2019s Miserere mei, Deus. Phillips directed the first chorus from the stage, a solo singer sang chant section from the eastern gallery, while, high in the south-western part of the hall the second chorus was heard magically from behind as soprano Emma Walsh embellished the choral sound by repeatedly ascending with apparently effortless grace to an ethereal high C. Part\u2019s Magnificat and Da Pacem Domine again led listeners to utterances that were at once almost inaudibly quiet yet palpable and definite. After Hildegard\u2019s O ecclesia, Josquin des Prez\u2019 Praeter rerum began with darker low-pitched textures, ending with the richly rewarding choral sound that had been heard at the start and to which it is so easy to become addicted. MUSIC\n\nTRIO ISIMSIZ\n\nCity Recital Hall, October 13\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nIn the Renaissance, a missa sine nomine was literally \u201ca Mass without a name\u201d, which meant that, unlike most Masses of the time, it didn\u2019t build on pre-existing material. Violinist Pablo Hernan Benedi, cellist Edvard Pogossian and pianist Erdem Misirlioglu have adopted the same paradoxical nomenclature by christening themselves Trio Isimsiz, which is Turkish for \u201ctrio without name\u201d. Their program of music by Brahms, Coll and Schubert also consisted of works without names in that all of them were simply called \u201cPiano Trio\u201d, though the trio by Francisco Coll did make references to pre-existing music and styles, which flitted into the background like music half-remembered in a dream. Musica Viva\u2019s Trio Isimsiz \u2013 violinist Pablo Hernan Benedi, cellist Edvard Pogossian and pianist Erdem Misirlioglu \u2013 at the City Recital Hall. Credit: Dylan Alcock One allusion was to Strauss\u2019 comic opera Die Schweigsame Frau (The Silent Woman) about an old man whose intolerance of noise becomes a vehicle for his torment by the young. It was, in one sense, a metaphor for the way chaotic textures in Coll\u2019s trio fragmented and subverted coherent musical ideas just as they began to emerge. The trio began with a short spiky restless movement in which pizzicato string notes and scattered staccato chords from the piano were thrown frenetically across the range of all three instruments, like someone tearing up a first draft. The second movement, the longest and weightiest, began with a bell-like chord on the piano and explored expressive melody and quiet, lonely spaces, sustaining ideas and building up tension in a more familiar way. The third movement returned to fragmented thinking, lurching in two-note figures from violin and cello accompanied by shattered sprays of notes from the piano.",

        "text": "Even when Dad does manage to take August to the park, which is a five-minute walk, he needs to rest.\n\nInstead, he is slumped on the lounge in their Bondi home. He\u2019s been there on and off for weeks, except between 11am and 4pm. He\u2019s been sleeping for about 12 hours a day.\n\nA few good matches to start the 2024-25 season for NSW in the Sheffield Shield, and Dad might have been opening the batting for Australia last summer against India.\n\nHe\u2019s too young to realise his father, Nic, is a very good cricketer. Not just any good cricketer, but the proud owner of a baggy green \u2013 and one of the most exciting batsmen in Australia over the past 15 years.\n\nAugust, a cheerful and energetic two-year-old boy, is confused. Cars. Lego. Passing a footy. Anything. Why isn\u2019t Dad being fun any more?\n\nAugust Maddinson just wants to play with Dad. Just like he\u2019s always done.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want sympathy or for this to be a sob story. That\u2019s not in his nature, says his best mate Adam Zampa.\n\nNic Maddinson is glad it\u2019s all over. After this interview, his private battle with testicular cancer will no longer be a secret.\n\n\u201cWe just told him that I was sick, and I was taking some medicine that made my hair fall out. We told him I was going to be OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe understood quite a lot of what was going on. He\u2019s a pretty intelligent kid. He was always rubbing my hair and asking what happened to it.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part was having to tell August I couldn\u2019t play with him,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cI was just so physically exhausted that I couldn\u2019t get off the couch.\n\nAugust has been telling people his dad no longer has hair because the wind blew it away. His mother, Bianca, is six months pregnant with his soon-to-be brother.\n\nA video pops up. Zampa, another star hailing from the NSW south coast, was one of the few who knew about Maddinson\u2019s cancer battle.\n\nHe sips a long black and scrolls on his phone, looking at photos from when chemotherapy kept him in bed most of the day.\n\nFollowing months of appointments, needles, chemotherapy sessions and sleepless nights, Maddinson is finally ready to tell his story \u2013 one only a small circle of cricketers have known about.\n\nNic Maddinson ahead of his Test debut against South Africa at the Adelaide Oval in 2016. Credit: Ryan Pierse\n\nAfter three Test matches, six T20 internationals, 129 first-class fixtures, 105 List A games and 144 T20s around the globe, cricket has been an afterthought for the 33-year-old who, half a lifetime ago, was one of the country\u2019s brightest young batting talents.\n\nIn the distance, a curator is preparing a pitch for Saturday\u2019s match between Maddinson\u2019s club, Eastern Suburbs, and Penrith \u2013 not that he\u2019ll be playing.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous Wednesday morning in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, and August is walking towards a cafe near Waverley Oval with his dad, mum, and two-week-old brother, Wilder, who is in a pram.\n\n\u201cI thought it would mean a lot. I think I would have regretted it if I didn\u2019t send it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019ll just do the video and no one will work it out,\u201d Maddinson says of his diagnosis. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought I was going OK. Looking at that video, he looks so shit, and sick, and pale. I feel 100 times better than I did then.\n\nZampa\u2019s wife, Harriet, rang Bianca to say there was no pressure to send a video if he wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. Maddinson did anyway.\n\nNic Maddinson (left) and Adam Zampa in 2009 after being picked for the NSW under-19 cricket team. Credit: Greg Totman\n\nOf course, he did. It was his best mate. He knew \u201cZamps\u201d would love it. The only problem was that Maddinson hadn\u2019t told anyone he was undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nAhead of Zampa\u2019s 100th T20 international against the West Indies in July, Maddinson was asked if he\u2019d like to send a video message that would be played on the team bus ahead of the match in St Kitts.\n\nWhile packing a suitcase at home, Maddinson\u2019s phone rang. It was Orchard.\n\nAt his end-of-season review, Maddinson mentioned the lump to Cricket Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Dr John Orchard. A Friday afternoon appointment was booked in minutes.\n\nThen he felt a lump. His GP thought it was probably a virus, but still recommended a scan. There were no available appointments, so it would have to wait until after the trip.\n\nHe felt sick and run-down but was looking forward to a holiday in Byron Bay.\n\nThis time last year, Maddinson was in the frame for a recall to the Australian Test team. Five months later, after a disappointing season yielding 267 runs at an average of 17.8, he was dropped for NSW\u2019s final Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania.\n\n\u201cTo have that pop up for me on an important day for me was really cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt got me a bit,\u201d Zampa says. \u201cI think people in the team who didn\u2019t know what was going on saw my reaction and thought, \u2018jeez, I had no idea\u2019.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should get on the plane tomorrow,\u201d Orchard said.\n\nThe scans confirmed a tumour. Maddinson rang Bianca at work to break the news.\n\nShe flew up the following day, while Maddinson stayed in Sydney for more tests. He still arrived in Byron Bay on the Sunday for a quick trip \u201cto let it all sink in\u201d.\n\nThree days later, Maddinson underwent surgery.\n\nNSW cricketer Nic Maddinson has overcome testicular cancer. Credit: Louie Douvis\n\n\u201cI was with John waiting for some scans, and that\u2019s when it hit me the most,\u201d he says. \u201cI had the surgery and I didn\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d\n\nThen, after about seven weeks, came the words he didn\u2019t want to hear: \u201cThe cancer has spread.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce I found out I had to have chemo, that was pretty hard to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had spread to parts of my abdominal lymph nodes and lung. That was a bit where it was pretty daunting. Bianca was the one asking all the questions. It was a bit of a blur. I\u2019m glad she was there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in awe of how strong and supportive she was through everything. She even quit her job as a dentist the day we found out I needed chemo.\n\n\u201cShe took on literally everything at home, so I could rest when I needed, all while pregnant and struggling with her own sleep and looking after two dogs and a toddler.\n\n\u201cThere were definitely days when it broke me mentally having to get up and go to hospital, and she helped me push through.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to sit with me, all day every day, but I felt guilty for wasting her days, so she only came in a handful of times.\n\n\u201cImagine if I hadn\u2019t gone to the doctor.\u201d\n\nNic Maddinson celebrates notching a ton for Victoria against NSW in 2020. Credit: AAP\n\nMaddinson thought he\u2019d miss a few weeks in the off-season. But he was told his vision, hearing and fitness might never be the same. Reality hit home.\n\n\u201cCricket was the last thing I wanted to think about,\u201d he says.\n\nZampa was worried.\n\n\u201cIn my head, I\u2019m unfortunately thinking about the worst-case scenario,\u201d the leg-spinner says. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to my best mate? He had a really positive outlook on it. He just got on with it and didn\u2019t make a fuss about it.\u201d\n\nOn May 19, Maddinson embarked on his greatest challenge yet. Facing the fastest bowlers in the world was light work compared to five hours of chemotherapy every day at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital \u2013 a five-minute drive from the SCG.\n\nNine weeks. Three cycles. Three weeks each. Endless sleep.\n\n\u201cAt the start, I actually felt OK,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cIt takes a while to get into your system. By day three, I felt like I\u2019d been hit by a truck. I didn\u2019t really improve much after that.\u201d\n\nNic Maddinson prepares to begin chemotherapy.\n\nOn day four, things took a turn. NSW teammate Moises Henriques came to visit. He sat silently, watching his mate have his body pumped full of drugs.\n\n\u201cI remember saying to Moey, \u2018I just need to sleep today, mate. There\u2019s no point hanging around too long\u2019.\u201d\n\nZampa offered to fly to Sydney whenever he could.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had someone close to me go through it,\u201d Zampa says. \u201cIt was drop everything to try and help. He was lucky he had good support around.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been really stubborn, so receiving help and asking for it when it\u2019s needed certainly isn\u2019t his strength. I couldn\u2019t have imagined going through it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking to my wife about it, then getting off the phone to Maddo, and I don\u2019t really have the answers myself or know how to help.\u201d\n\nMaddinson felt bloated and put on weight.\n\n\u201cBy the second or third week, I lost all my hair. I was feeling pretty average,\u201d he says. \u201cI was taking types of steroids to manage side effects, but they would keep me up at night. I\u2019d be at the hospital from about 11am to 4pm. Then a sleep. Then I\u2019d force myself to have dinner. I\u2019d sleep until about 1am, but sometimes I\u2019d then be awake until 6am. I found that difficult. I was super drained and felt like I had to sleep 24/7.\n\n\u201cI felt guilty. I couldn\u2019t do anything around the house.\u201d\n\nOnly a handful knew \u2013 family, Zampa, Sean Abbott, Henriques, Josh Philippe, Cricket NSW high-performance boss Greg Mail, and a handful of other friends outside of cricket. Word spread quietly, but Maddinson wanted to keep it tight.\n\nDuring the winter, Mail told Blues players.\n\nMaddinson, with no hair, moustache or beard, turned up one morning at Centennial Park to have a coffee with teammates before a fitness session. Hair was always Maddinson\u2019s thing. He once bleached it peroxide blond before a Big Bash game and joked that \u201cGwen Stefani\u201d was the inspiration.\n\nNic Maddinson\u2019s blond era. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cNone of the boys asked, but it was pretty obvious something was going on,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cI looked completely different.\n\n\u201cI wanted to feel like myself and go for a walk or a run. I didn\u2019t really want to train for cricket. Batting didn\u2019t interest me. I wasn\u2019t envious of them playing. That was the first time in my life. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve really wanted to play.\u201d\n\nHe suspected some players on Australia\u2019s Test tour of the West Indies knew. Some nights, when he couldn\u2019t sleep, he\u2019d watch the first session of action in the Caribbean on television as Bianca and August slept.\n\nSam Konstas, his NSW opening partner, was struggling with the bat for Australia \u2013 and so was Maddinson, in a different way.\n\nIn the morning, August would often find his dad asleep on the couch. He just wanted to go to the park again.\n\n\u201cYou try and put yourself in those shoes, and it\u2019s almost impossible to explain to your kid why you can\u2019t play with them,\u201d Zampa says. \u201cHis little guy Augie is an absolute champion. He\u2019s all over the place and a ball of energy.\u201d\n\nMaddinson adds: \u201cAt home, he\u2019d want to chase me down the hallway and tackle me.\n\n\u201cBianca ended up saying to me, \u2018I think you\u2019re trying to do too much\u2019. I tried to ride my bike one day and feel stupid for doing it now. I knew I felt terrible, but I just wanted to do something that I was used to doing.\n\n\u201cIt was the slowest and longest nine weeks.\u201d\n\nMaddinson felt foggy and spaced out. He watched a lot of Netflix and cycling races. He deferred an online undergraduate psychology course at Curtin University because he was so exhausted.\n\n\u201cI was in hospital every Monday for about 12 weeks in a row. The first Monday we didn\u2019t have to go into hospital was such a relief.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part mentally was having to get a needle every day. I had bruised hands and forearms from the number of needles. I don\u2019t think I could have physically taken myself back in there for one more day.\n\n\u201cI felt I was mentally pretty strong but I think I would have thrown it in.\u201d\n\nJuly 14 was a good day. Chemo was finally done.\n\nMaddinson felt terrible but summoned the energy for a photo with August, who\u2019d made a sign for his dad.\n\nIt said \u201cLAST CHEMO\u201d and was covered with stickers of dinosaurs.\n\nNic Maddinson with son August after his last chemotherapy session.\n\nTen days later, he texted Blues batting coach Nick Larkin.\n\n\u201cCan I come and hit some balls?\u201d\n\nOn July 28, still feeling terrible, he drove to Sydney Olympic Park, padded up and put a helmet on. No one else was there.\n\nLarkin threw down some cross-seamers. The dashing left-hander belted them. He batted for half an hour, hit about 100 balls, and walked out. It was what he needed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t touch a bat for a month after that,\u201d Maddinson says. \u201cIt was a weird feeling. Every time I mishit one, I got angry at myself in the nets. It was the first time I could bat without a care in the world.\n\n\u201cI stopped batting for a little bit because I didn\u2019t want to just not care.\n\n\u201cEight weeks after my last chemo round, I got good news. The treatment had worked.\u201d\n\nThe road back to cricket wasn\u2019t straightforward. The batting and strength returned. His fitness is still a work in progress.\n\n\u201cMy recent tests were all good, and I can go about getting back into cricket, which I love,\u201d he says.\n\nVictorian openers Nic Maddinson (left) and Will Pucovski in 2020. Credit: Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Maddinson had a centre wicket net session with a few Blues squad members.\n\nOnce he faces some faster bowlers and ticks a few fielding boxes, Maddinson will be eligible for selection \u2013 perhaps for Easts, NSW Second XI, or the Blues\u2019 Shield match at the SCG from November 10 to 13.\n\nHave his goals changed?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough question to answer right now. Yes and no,\u201d he says. \u201cI would still love to play Test cricket again, but I\u2019m more realistic. The older you get, the less likely it is to happen.\n\n\u201cI had a really good opportunity last year and I just didn\u2019t really grab it. I\u2019m just really excited to try and play cricket again. I was dropped at the end of last year, so I\u2019m not expecting to be straight back in the side.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing would be to say I am available. That would be a nice day.\u201d\n\nHe hopes something good comes of telling his story.\n\nNic Maddinson holding new son Wilder, alongside August and wife Bianca.\n\n\u201cI feel very lucky I live in a country where we have good medical care,\u201d he says. \u201cI am in a pretty privileged position to have access to John Orchard. He helped sort out all my appointments and was with me the whole time.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out I needed chemo, it hit me hard because I almost didn\u2019t go. I thought it would go away. To know that I caught it probably as early as I could have, and it still spread into other parts of my body, that was scary.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s so important if you have anything you\u2019re worried about, get it checked out.\n\n\u201cIt feels silly to not tell my story. If one person reads it and gets checked, I\u2019ll be happy. I grew up in the country and a lot of people fob it off. It\u2019s a \u2018she\u2019ll be right\u2019 attitude. Get the stuff checked out, it can make all the difference.\u201d\n\nAugust is back at the cafe with a grin on his face.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the park, a kick of the footy, and a slow, steady return to normal life for the Maddinson family.",
