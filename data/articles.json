        "text": "A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.\n\nPeanut allergies began to decline in the US after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as four months.\n\nThe rate of peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 fell by more than 27 per cent after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015, and by more than 40 per cent after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.\n\nAbout 2 per cent of children are affected by peanut allergy. (Getty)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a remarkable thing, right?\u201d said Dr David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published on Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics.\n\nHill and colleagues analysed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.\n\n\u201cI can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn't implemented this public health effort,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout 60,000 children have avoided food allergies since 2015, including 40,000 children who otherwise would have developed peanut allergies.\n\nStill, about 8 per cent of children are affected by food allergies, including more than 2 per cent with a peanut allergy.\n\nPeanut allergy is caused when the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\nFor decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3.\n\nParents are now urged to introduce peanuts to their kids early. (Getty)\n\nBut in 2015, Gideon Lack at King\u2019s College London, published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.\n\nLack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80 per cent.\n\nLater analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70 per cent of kids into adolescence.\n\nThe study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts \u2014 but putting them into practice has been slow.\n\nOnly about 29 per cent of pediatricians and 65 per cent of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.\n\nConfusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study.\n\nEarly on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.\n\nThe data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire US pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.\n\nHowever, the new research offers \u201cpromising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nAdvocates for the 33 million people in the US with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.\n\n\u201cThis research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,\u201d said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research & Education, or FARE.\n\nThe new study emphasises the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said.\n\nParents should consult their paediatricians about any questions.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.\u201d\n\nTiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her two young sons.\n\nAt first, Leon\u2019s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said.\n\nBut Leon explained how the science had changed.\n\n\u201cAs a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo when someone told me, \u2018This is how it\u2019s done now, these are the new guidelines,\u2019 I just though, OK, well, this is what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(Getty)\n\nLoi and her team discovered \ufeffthat patients who had these T-cells had a better outcome of fighting cancer and generally had healthier breast tissue.\n\n\"These cells act like local guards, ready to attack abnormal cells that might turn into cancer,\" Loi said.\n\n\"This protection may have evolved to defend mothers during the vulnerable post-pregnancy period, but today it also lowers breast cancer risk, especially the aggressive type called triple-negative breast cancer.\"\n\nThe study used data from over 1000 breast cancer patients.\n\nOf those women, the ones who had children were found to have significant\ufeffly more T-cells.\n\nAnd, in some groups, they lived longer after a breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nResearchers at \ufeffthe Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Victoria made the discovery.

        "text": "Warning \u2014 this article contains images and references to offensive and racist language.\n\nGamilaroi man and ABC presenter Tony Armstrong has travelled Australia and abroad to unravel the drivers of racism in sport \u2014 and search for positive, practical solutions \u2014 in the documentary series End Game.\n\nIn it, some of the biggest names in sport leant into the collective ambition of eradicating racism on and off the field.\n\nFormer Liverpool football great John Barnes, US Navajo and Angel City FC footballer Madison Hammond, Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja, South Sydney NRL player Cody Walker and dual Brisbane AFL premiership winner Callum Ah Chee all joined the End Game team.\n\nTony Armstrong shares a laugh with Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja. (Supplied)\n\nSpeaking to the ABC as the series premiered, Armstrong was overcome with emotion as he recalled working with former Sydney Swans teammate and childhood hero Adam Goodes.\n\n\"It [End Game] wouldn't have worked without him. We didn't want to re-traumatise him, but that's not what happened. He's such a good bloke,\" Armstrong said, wiping away tears.\n\nBrothers standing united together against racism, Adam Goodes and Tony Armstrong at the SCG. (Supplied)\n\nGoodes is deeply respected by many First Nations peoples across the nation for standing up for himself, his culture, his people and his beliefs.\n\nBut despite being a premiership winner and a two-time Brownlow Medallist, in 2013 Goodes was called an \"ape\" by a teenager during an Indigenous Round match between Sydney and Collingwood.\n\nGoodes 'cut down' because he was powerful: King Charlie King lays down a challenge to AFL to prove it has changed, in the wake of a documentary chronicling the racism that ended Australian footballer Adam Goodes's career.\n\nIt was the catalyst for two years of relentless booing on-field and criticism from some media commentators.\n\n\"I totally felt like I wasn't getting any respect for the way I was verbalising my situation,\" Goodes told Armstrong.\n\n\" Sometimes you can say and do all the right things, and it still doesn't work. \"\n\nAfter playing for sixteen years at an elite level, the jeers took a huge toll on the former Sydney captain.\n\nGoodes walked away from the sport he loved at the end of 2015.\n\n\"For me, once I retired from football, I knew my role was taking a back seat.\"\n\nTrolling motivated Armstrong to make series\n\nIn the decade since Goodes' retirement racist trolling has moved online, with people of all ages suffering the consequences.\n\nA former ABC News Breakfast presenter and two-time Logie award winner, Armstrong said he was motivated to make the series after he faced a high degree of online trolling directed at him, his family and partner.\n\n\"I basically got to a point where I'm copping a fair bit. I can handle it at this point in time,\" he said.\n\n\" It's incumbent on me [to make the series] with the position I'm in professionally, how I'm seen in Australia. I felt like I could have an impact. \"\n\nSome of the racist trolling aimed at Tony Armstrong and his family. (Supplied)\n\nWhile in England, Armstrong caught up with Premier League Hall of Fame player Rio Ferdinand who spoke about his personal experiences with racism and the need to apply pressure on the highest levels of the sporting and corporate world to fight it.\n\n\"I think the social media companies need to take more of a responsibility to put the little things in place to have consequences for bad practice,\" he said.\n\nRio Ferdinand, regarded as one of football's greatest players, opens up about the toll racism took on him and his family. (Supplied)\n\nLegendary West Indian cricketer Michael Holding also shared his motivation for speaking out about racism during a live cricket broadcast at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement in July 2020.\n\n\"If you have a platform, use it, and I'm not just talking about black people, white people,\" he said.\n\n\"If you believe that there should be equality use that platform that you have got.\"\n\nWest Indian cricket legend and commentator Michael Holding is calling for athletes to step up. (Supplied)\n\nAustralian cricketer and proud Muruwari woman Ash Gardner recalled the attacks she faced for posting on social media her view that it was inappropriate for the Australian cricket team to play on January 26 due to the pain the day brings to First Nations people.\n\nGardner told Armstrong she found the abuse shocking, but stood by her comments.\n\n\"The legacy that I want to leave behind is not actually what I did on the cricket pitch but how I can change things for the greater good,\" she said.\n\nTony Armstrong and the End Game crew at the home of Australian cricketer Ash Gardner. (Supplied)\n\nArmstrong said the conversations he had with athletes, particularly from overseas, opened his eyes to the difficulties when calling out racism in Australia.\n\n\"One of the things that struck me and made me quite frustrated was overseas they actually say that they've got an issue,\" he said.\n\n\" Whereas here in Australia we're just like, 'nothing to see here, man. What do you mean? We're all happy, aren't we?' \"\n\nArmstrong wary of backlash\n\nThe series was directed by Guugu Yimithirr man Dean Gibson, who is no stranger to the subject of racism.\n\nIn 2021 he directed and wrote the award-winning documentary Incarceration Nation which examined the Australian justice system's treatment of Indigenous people and the historical systemic racism involved.\n\nEnd Game director Dean Gibson alongside cricketing great Michael Holding. (Supplied: Dean Gibson)\n\n\"Sadly, these things happen on a regular basis across the country \u2014 over the weekend, across all sporting codes, across all communities across Australia. So we're well aware that this a really prevalent, relevant topic,\" he said.\n\nThe director described Armstrong as \"brave and courageous\" for the stance he has taken and for being the face of the End Game series.\n\nHe acknowledged the risk that Armstrong will again come under significant racist trolling when the documentary airs.\n\n\"You could sense that it was weighing on him [Armstrong] as the production grew and he recognised this will be a national conversation, that people will have strong opinions either way,\" he said.\n\n\"He lifted the weight and he really rides that rollercoaster of those emotions. That's real, and I think that's the best part of what he brings to this production.\"\n\nTony Armstrong hopes the new series will help to inspire and educate people. (Supplied)\n\nThe documentary makers commissioned a survey of 2,111 Australians from social impact agency No 2nd Place about attitudes to sport, fandom and racism.\n\nOnly 27 per cent of respondents agreed that racism was an issue in their favourite sport, compared to almost double who agreed that racism was a problem in the country \u2014 something the report's authors described as \"the ultimate form of rose-coloured glasses\".\n\nKnow The Real Score Are you game to tackle racism in sport?\n\nThree out of four respondents denied they held prejudice against other cultures.\n\nWhen an incident of racism had been witnessed, only one out four bystanders agreed they would check on the wellbeing of a victim.\n\n\"We shouldn't underestimate how hard it is for a bystander to speak up,\" Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharam Sivaraman told the ABC at the official launch of End Game.\n\n\" You might feel vulnerable as well. You might be the same colour of skin as the person that's being attacked, and then you're expected to step in and probably you're going to cop it as well. \"\n\nGiridharan Sivaraman says eliminating racism on and off the field requires a systemic, national approach. (ABC News: Jack Ailwood)\n\nMr Sivaraman said the National Anti-Racism Framework launched by the Australian Human Rights Commission last year offered \"much bigger solutions \u2026 that change our systems and institutions so that the racism that we see on streets, on trains, in schools doesn't happen\".\n\nMr Sivaraman said the neo-Nazi attack on the Camp Sovereignty protest site in August was a sign that racism was on the rise.\n\n\"The fact that neo-Nazis openly, without masks or sunglasses and in broad daylight, attacked Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, that's hugely concerning,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\nCan sports drive positive change?\n\nWith the first of End Game's three episodes airing on Tuesday night, Tony Armstrong and Dean Gibson said they wanted it to inspire and educate.\n\n\"The tone from day one was we wanted it to be an empowering piece of television that really empowers First Nations people, but also \u2026 people from all backgrounds, to have this conversation and in a respectful, safe and understanding empathetic manner,\" Dean said.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong will tackle Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport, with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\n\"People can overcome racism. I think society can overcome it. It just takes the bravery to be the people to talk about it.\"\n\nThe potential of sport to unify people showed up in the survey's finding that 91 per cent of those who felt like they belonged in their favourite sport also felt a sense of belonging in Australian society.\n\nFor the filmmakers, their hope is that sport can function as more than just a game, where inclusion transcends prejudice.\n\n\"I don't want them to watch this series and be like, 'oh, here's another 'racism sucks, woe is us [story]'. That's not what it's about. This is about giving a set of tools to people,\" Armstrong said.\n\nStream all episodes of End Game free on ABC iview or watch on ABC TV at 8:30pm.",

(ABC News)\n\nThe sign was believed to be taken between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nJack Perkins, son of Larry Perkins and a racing driver himself, condemned the act, labelling it as \"disappointing\" for the community.\n\n\"[The sign] is a really cool thing for the community and obviously in the motor racing world,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the thing that really annoys you; when community go to this effort to put something up, they're proud of their town and proud of that particular sign [and then someone steals it].\"\n\nInstalling sign a community-led initiative\n\nLarry Perkins, who retired in 2003, won the Bathurst 1000 race six times during his career and raced against some of the world's best in Formula 1.\n\nMildura councillor Glenn Milne said he was shocked by the theft because everyone in the district would be familiar with the sign.\n\n\"Larry Perkins is a legend of Cowangie. He was known as the Cowangie kid,\" he said.\n\n\" This isn't just any street sign. It's an iconic sign and it's a piece of Australia's history really \u2026 this is something different and it's a pretty low act. \"\n\nGlenn Milne says the theft is \"sad\". (Supplied: Mildura Rural City Council)\n\nThe sign was first installed by the Cowangie Country Women's Association in 1993.\n\nIt has been replaced twice since, with older, faded signs auctioned off.\n\nThose sales raised about $18,000, which went towards the town's Kow Plains Homestead and old nursing station.\n\nCr Milne said the funds were valuable to the community.\n\n\"That money goes towards looking after those and maintaining those facilities for the people of our community,\" he said.\n\n\"That\u2019s now taken away an opportunity to raise $6,000 or $8,000.\"\n\nSon urges thieves to take a look in the mirror\n\nMr Perkins said damage done to the sign's metal poles meant installing a new one would come at an increased cost to the Cowangie community.\n\nJack Perkins says the theft occurred just days after this year's Bathurst 1000 race. (Supplied: Jack Perkins)\n\n\"We'd have to replace the posts,\" he said.\n\n\"Last time we changed the sign, we only had to change the visual sign. The post and everything was still there ... it becomes a bigger job and again it's community driven.\"\n\nMr Perkins urged the thieves to return the sign so it could be reinstalled.\n\nJack Perkins says it would be expensive to replace the stolen sign. (Supplied: Perkins Engineering)\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's a couple of weeks away. If someone gets a conscience and just drops it back on the side of the highway at night, it's just easy. We would be able to weld it back together and it would live to see another day,\" Mr Perkins said.\n\n\"It's just disappointing in 2025 that there's people stealing signs off the highway, like you've honestly got to have a look in the mirror.\"\n\nHe also asked people to keep an eye out for the sign as it was unlikely the thief would be able to sell it without someone reporting it.",

        "text": "Australia and the US have inked a deal on rare earths and critical minerals.\n\nThe critical minerals deal will see about $US8.5 billion invested into various projects over the next six months.\n\nPrior to the meeting, President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One, \"I don't want to play the rare earths game with China\", referencing export controls on a range of critical minerals China hit the US with in April, and expanded recently.\n\nAs Australia's ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, put it last month: \"Australia more or less equals the periodic table, geology has been kind to us.\"\n\nBut being able to mine the raw materials, and having the capacity to process them into something useful, represent two separate challenges.\n\nAustralian companies have mostly solved the latter part by selling to China.\n\nAustralia sits on huge reserves of critical minerals, but what do they do? Australia is joining the European Union and the United States in establishing strategic reserves of critical minerals, but what do they actually do, and why are they so important?\n\nEarlier this month China placed strict export controls on holmium, europium, ytterbium, thulium, erbium.\n\nIn April it slapped similar controls on samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nChina's position as the world's factory over the past decades, combined with its successful position as the world's dominant miner and processor of rare earths, nickel, lithium and cobalt among others, has seen these minerals move into a massive amount of mundane household items, from vacuum cleaners to headphones.\n\nBut elements on this list are also being used in cutting edge nanotechnology and materials research.\n\nSome have also proven to be essential in the advancement of life-saving cancer treatments, powerful medical diagnostics and imaging tools, as well as more undetectable weapons and sharper military intelligence gathering.\n\nThe AI boom\n\nThe expansion in artificial intelligence (AI)'s capacity is underpinned by the rollout of data centres and high-powered Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).\n\nFor example, one of the steps in manufacturing a semi-conductor is polishing the wafer, and cerium oxide has proven to be an effective material in that process.\n\nOther rare earth elements can also improve the manufacturing process.\n\n\"Doping rare earth elements in semiconductor materials can adsorb impurities, thereby effectively improving the purity and integrity of semiconductor materials,\" according to US-based Stanford Advanced Materials.\n\nAs chips have become smaller and more powerful, lanthanum oxide has been identified as a better material than silicon dioxide as a component in transistors.\n\nRare earth elements have improved the manufacturing and performance of semiconductor chips. (Reuters: Florence Lo, file photo)\n\nMedical diagnostics\n\nOne heavy rare earth element, gadolinium, has become crucial for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nIt's one of the most magnetic elements on the periodic table, and that's made it a useful part of MRI contrast injections.\n\nGadolinium is paramagnetic, which means it's attracted by an external magnetic force.\n\nSo when you're injected with a gadolinium-based contrast, it allows the MRI scanner to produce higher resolution and more accurate images.\n\nIn a 2019 paper, South Korean scientists found that adding a range of rare earth elements to CT scan contrast agents, including ytterbrium and gadolinium, provided much better results when compared with an iodine-based contrast agent.\n\n\"Doping\" an yttrium aluminium garnet with neodymium created the Nd:YAG laser, commonly used in cosmetic medicine as an ablative laser for the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, tattoo and hair removal.\n\nGadolinium has proven to be an effective contrast solution in MRI scans. (ABC News: Alison Branley, file photo)\n\nRenewable energy\n\nThe magnetic properties of heavy rare earths like neodymium, dysprosium and praseodymium have made them essential in manufacturing of high-performance permanent magnets.\n\nIn direct-drive wind turbines, like the ones at the Mt Millar Wind Farm on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula for example, use of these magnets improves efficiency at low wind speeds.\n\nAnd since they don't have a gearbox, there are fewer moving parts that require maintenance, which lowers running costs.\n\n\"The increased demand for wind turbine components and rise in manufacturing capacity for wind energy will drive higher demand for specific materials, including [rare earth elements] such as neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium, as well as critical materials like copper, nickel and zinc,\" the Global Wind Energy Council said in its 2024 Global Wind Report.\n\nThey're also vital components of the electric motors and battery chemistry that power EVs, which is tipped to be a key driver of growth in rare earth element demand over coming years.\n\nWind turbines at Mt Millar use direct drive generators, which require rare earth magnets. (ABC audience submitted: timo29570)\n\nDefence applications\n\nA decade ago, David S Abraham's book The Elements of Power: Gadgets, Guns, and the Struggle for a Sustainable Future in the Rare Metal Age described the F-35 jet as a \"flying periodic table\".\n\n\"The nuts and bolts that hold the plane together are made from beryllium \u2026 gallium helps amplify the radar's signal \u2026 tantalum sits in the capacitors needed for laser targeting, controls, and cockpit displays',\" Mr Abrahams wrote.\n\nElements like yttrium, gadolinium, dysprosium and terbium have been incorporated into ceramics, alloys and coatings to improve the stealth of military aircraft, missiles and vehicles.\n\nEuropium and yttrium are used in night-vision goggles and rare earths have improved heads up displays.",

        "text": "When job hunting, you might be looking at things such as pay, hours and location.\n\nBut how much do you think about the workplace culture?\n\n\"Organisational culture drives an awful lot of worker satisfaction and performance,\" explains Paula Brough, director of the Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing at Grifith University.\n\nProfessor Brough defines workplace culture as the \"invisible way that behaviour in the workplace is governed\".\n\n\"It's often referred to as 'the way things are done around here',\" she says.\n\nWhen the culture at work is toxic, that can be detrimental, says Carol Kulik from the Centre for Workplace Excellence at the University of South Australia\n\n\"That's an extra day-to-day strain you are carrying on top of workload.\n\n\"And we know over the long run, there is a body of literature that shows having that extra layer of stress is what leads to heart attacks or high blood pressure,\" she says as examples of physical and mental health conditions that can result from working in a toxic work environment.\n\nIt is possible to get a sense of whether an organisation has healthy culture before you take a job.\n\nBut it's about more than having a pool table in the lunch room, our experts warn.\n\nSigns of a toxic workplace culture and how to break the cycle A difficult environment can be \"systemic\", says an expert, but with a new law in place to support employee wellbeing, everyone can play a part in change. It first starts with knowing the signs.\n\nDefining workplace culture\n\nThere is formal and informal culture in workplaces, says Professor Brough.\n\n\"The formal culture relates to policies and practices, of which there is normally a whole load of HR policies related to that: how you take leave,\" she says for example.\n\n\"Then there is the informal culture \u2026 [which] can be anything from the way you talk to colleagues and your managers, to the style of dress, when you take lunch, if you eat at your desk.\"\n\nWe need to care about workplace culture, Professor Kulik says, because organisations can't have a policy or standard operating procedure for every possible circumstance.\n\n\" What culture is supposed to do, is fill in any gaps. \"\n\nShe says when a company has shared values, it has a strong culture.\n\nSecurity and predictability\n\n'Bring your pet to work day' might be more of a gimmick than a sign of healthly workplace culture. (Pexels)\n\nA healthy workplace culture should give employees a sense of security and predictability, Professor Kulik says, using the example of US-based department store Nordstrom.\n\n\"Every department store will say they value customer service, but Nordstrom took it to an extreme and said the most important thing was the customer experience and good service.\"\n\nWhen a customer returns something, say a dress, and it appears to have been worn, Professor Kulik says the workplace culture makes it easy for the employee to know what to do.\n\n\"It gives it give them some freedom to say, what is most important is service to customer, so I can go ahead and accept this item [regardless of whether it has been worn].\"\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nA toxic workplace culture may mean an employee feels unsafe, says Professor Brough.\n\n\"Any issues around conflict in workplace \u2014 that's one of the strongest predictors of psychological injury.\n\n\"Any sort of \u2026 racial, sexual, gender prejudice that happens \u2014 any of those issues obviously produce a very difficult, unsafe, toxic work environment.\"\n\nLeaving full-time work for comedy Leaving my day job was the only way to circuit break my life back into balance. Six months later, life is very different.\n\nSpotting a workplace culture\n\nThere are several ways you can identify a workplace's culture before working there, including their website, reputation, and asking the right questions.\n\nPublic image and consistency\n\nYou can tell a lot from an organisation's public image, our experts say.\n\n\"See what the company says is their culture,\" suggests Professor Kulik.\n\n\"Look at things like their website, their mission statement, their social media.\"\n\nShe says while naturally a company will only say positive things about itself, look for consistency.\n\n\"If every time the organisation talks about itself, it's always describing innovation, always talking about community, that is a really good signal.\"\n\nShe says if a company's mission statement says it values diversity and inclusion, you can also try to fact check.\n\n\" [If] you look at photos of management and it's all white men, you can maybe question that. \"\n\nReputation\n\nProfessor Kulik says to \"listen to the stories\" of past and current employees.\n\nShe says there are useful online workplace review platforms where current and former employees can anonymously share reviews and insights about their employers.\n\nWhile you are likely to mainly see negative reviews, Professor Kulik says look for consistency.\n\nIf the same issue is raised again and again, that might be a red flag.\n\nProfessor Brough says if you don't feel comfortable approaching employees directly, you could ask during your interview if there is anyone else you can talk to.\n\n\"Most companies, if they didn't have much to hide, would entertain that idea.\n\n\"Ask about the more informal aspects of the culture; what's it like working here? Where do people eat lunch?\"\n\nExperience with the organisation\n\nYou can get a sense of the culture by how the organisation responds to you as applicant, says Professor Kulik.\n\n\"If it takes months and months, and you never hear anything, that tells you something about how they value your time.\"\n\nIf you have any direct experience with the company as a customer, client or consumer, for example, that is also worth reflecting on.\n\nQuestions to ask\n\nProfessor Brough says you should feel confident to ask about company culture during an interview.\n\nQuestions like:\n\nHow much support do staff receive from managers and each other?\n\nIs there conflict between teams or departments?\n\nWhat are the career development opportunities?\n\nHow much autonomy do I have over where I work, my hours of work, who I work with?\n\n\"Autonomy and flexibility is an important predictor of a healthy workplace,\" Professor Brough says.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nProfessor Kulik warns not to get \"distracted by rhetoric\".\n\n\"Look for actions, behaviours.\n\n\"Don't be distracted by free snacks or bring your pet to work day.\"\n\nAdd to your watchlist The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.\n\nThose \"gimmicks\" might sound nice, but might not be true reflections of company values, says Professor Brough.\n\n\"There might be somewhere that talks about having a healthy workplace because they have a walking track to use at lunchtime.\n\n\"You think that sounds lovely, but in reality, people are eating lunch at their desks, or it's too hot to go for a walk because there's no shade.\"",

        "text": "A visitor favourite at the Art Gallery of Ballarat is an 1887 oil painting of a man in a top hat standing next to what can only be described as an absolute unit of a bull.\n\nThe rectangular beast \u2014 built like a proverbial brick shithouse \u2014 elicits a giggle from even the most serious gallery-goer.\n\nBut the title, Henry Stone and his Durham Ox, does little to explain why such a painting was made in the first place.\n\nIf we look through the pages of art history, we can find several other artworks showcasing enormous livestock.\n\nSo what's the deal with this niche genre of painting I'm calling \"Big Cow\"?\n\nVery big cow, or very small man? You decide. (Supplied: National Museums Scotland, National Museum of Rural Life)\n\nBallarat's ox\n\nThomas Flintoff was an English-born painter and photographer who spent time in the US before following the gold rush to Victoria in 1853.\n\nHe set up a photography and painting studio in Ballarat where he made portraits of locals, and eventually relocated to Melbourne.\n\nThomas Flintoff's trade cut advertising his premises on Sturt Street, Ballarat. (Supplied: State Library Victoria)\n\nNear the end of his life, he executed the 1.2-metre-wide oil painting of Henry Stone \u2014 a wealthy Melbourne butcher \u2014 standing with an enormous red bull.\n\nBut this painting was no novelty. In fact, it was a very specific reference to a legendary animal from 100 years earlier.\n\nThe history of Big Cow art\n\nSince the dawn of time, humans have painted animals.\n\nIndeed, the \"Big Cow\" genre can be dated as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period: the famous Lascaux Cave in France contains more than 30 paintings of bulls, the largest measuring over five metres long.\n\nThe Lascaux paintings date to around 17,000 to 22,000 years ago. (Image: wikimedia commons)\n\nThe Lascaux artists painted wild animals though, as it wasn't until 10,000 years ago that humans began domesticating cattle in the Middle East.\n\nHumanity's reverence for large cattle had always been linked to the ancient knowledge that big cow equals more food, but with the invention of farming came the realisation that more cow food equals bigger cow.\n\nBut it wasn't until the 18th century that a boom in selective breeding and animal science really took off in Europe, bringing about new, specially-bred bovine of truly phenomenal proportions.\n\nThe OG Durham Ox\n\nIn March, 1796 a calf was born on the Ketton Hall estate in Brafferton, north-east England. He was an early Shorthorn, a type of cattle bred specifically to grow to a gargantuan size.\n\nUnits of measurement were sometimes inconsistent (or prone to exaggeration) back then, but it's estimated this steer \u2014 who became known as the \"Durham Ox\" \u2014 weighed in at more than 1700kg. That's the same as an SUV.\n\nBritish livestock was going through a boom at the time. The introduction of turnip crops in the 1730s had provided a source of food for cows over the winter, allowing farmers to keep fattening their herds up for longer before sending them to slaughter.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThe Durham Ox was a particularly juicy specimen.\n\nIn 1801 he was purchased by a travelling showman-agriculturalist named John Day who toured the creature all over the country, turning a nice profit on ticket sales.\n\nIt's hard to believe that in the early 19th century people really lined up and paid their hard-earned pennies to see a big cow (I guess they didn't have social media).\n\nBut part of John Day's genius marketing strategy was getting the image of the beast out there in front of the public's eyeballs.\n\nNot only did he sell merchandise at his shows, but artists were invited to make paintings, drawings, and (most importantly) prints of the Durham Ox, which circulated far and wide \u2014 as far as the fledgling colonies on the other side of the world.\n\nCeramics like this were popular merch at the fairs and exhibitions where John Day exhibited the Durham Ox. (Image: Bidsquare)\n\nTo viewers in the 1880s, Thomas Flintoff's painting in the Art Gallery of Ballarat was making a very clear reference to the original Durham Ox, telling us that this agricultural icon remained ingrained in people's memories for at least a century.\n\nIt's telling, too, that although Thomas Flintoff was also a photographer, he was asked to paint Stone's animal, not photograph it.\n\nOn one hand, an oil painting better replicates the style of the images of the original Durham Ox (who lived long before the invention of the camera). On the other hand, the painter is better placed to manipulate and exaggerate reality, while the photographer is more tethered to it.\n\nReplicating the style of English agricultural paintings \u2014 decades after the invention of photography had made this type of image redundant \u2014 was also a way for colonial Victoria to assert its ties to the old world.\n\nIndeed, the landscape in which Henry Stone and his tractor-sized ox stand barely looks recognisable as Australia.\n\nJoan Ross's hand-painted digital collage on paper, Balla Arat, was commissioned by the Art Gallery of Ballarat in 2024. (Courtesy of the artist and N.Smith Gallery, Sydney)\n\nA Ballarat icon\n\nSince it was acquired by the Art Gallery of Ballarat in 1979, Henry Stone and his Durham Ox has been a favourite of locals and visitors alike.\n\nAnd just as Thomas Flintoff referenced the original Durham Ox in his 1887 painting, contemporary Australian artists have even incorporated the iconic silhouette of Henry Stone's bull into their works, giving new life to this prodigious beast.\n\nAnna Glynn's Flintoff swallows von Guerard, created in 2020, is a tribute to Henry Stone and his Durham Ox. (Supplied: Anna Glynn)\n\nJoan Ross's 2024 digital collage Bella Arat uses Flintoff's Ox to playfully interrogate the ways the Victorian landscape has been shaped by colonialism, while Anna Glynn's 2020 watercolour, Flintoff swallows von Guerard critiques the canon of Australian landscape painting and reflects the sublimation of nature by two centuries of agriculture.",

I don't think local council should have the ability to be able to walk into private residences and demand for this to be done and that to be done, but there are times when we need to act and we need to take the legal opportunities that are available to us,\" Mr Mathers said.\n\nMore short-term accommodation needed\n\nTourism operators are also frustrated by a lack of short-term accommodation, something they believe needs to be addressed before the 2032 Olympics.\n\n\"When it comes to freehold land, it can be really frustrating for organisations like mine, for the general community, for local and state government in regards to them sitting there bare when we have a desperate need for accommodation,\" Capricorn Enterprise chief executive officer Mary Carroll said.\n\nMary Carroll says there is a desperate need for more short-term accommodation. (ABC Capricornia: Katrina Beavan)\n\nThe Capricorn Resort on the coast in Yeppoon closed in 2016, and its 331 rooms are now deteriorating.\n\nIndependent research from Tourism Events Queensland last year found 1,219 short-term accommodation rooms were needed in the Rockhampton and Capricorn Coast region before 2032.\n\nMost of the accommodation is filled by fly-in fly-out workers on construction projects like the $1.98 billion Rockhampton Ring Road and the $983 million Fitzroy to Gladstone pipeline.\n\n\"We are desperate for these new short-term rooms because I'm losing short-term accommodation in unit complexes to long-term bookings, either people living in them and taking them out of the rental pool, or major jobs like the Rockhampton Ring Road taking up a lot of rooms with their workers,\" Ms Carroll said.\n\nThe Fitzroy River in Rockhampton is set to host rowing and canoe sprints for the 2032 Games. (Supplied: Rockhampton Grammar School)\n\nThe figure was calculated before Rockhampton was named as the host of the 2032 Olympic rowing and canoe sprint.\n\n\"We're waiting for that work to be redone to see what that figure will be, but at the moment we're standing here with high 90 per cent occupancies across our region for much of the year,\" Ms Carroll said.\n\nWith more sports set to be held across regions in the state, Ms Mercorella said it would not be just accommodation needed for the games, but the construction leading up to it.\n\n\"We really need to be thinking about how we're going to be creative about ensuring that we have adequate accommodation,\" she said.\n\n\"We'll need to think very carefully about how we're going to ensure that this event is a success, and how we can continue to house our local population as well as some of those visitors who will be more transient in nature.\"",

        "text": "The world's largest art museum, the Louvre, has approximately half a million objects in its collection, with about 30,000 on display, and sees on average 8 million visitors per year. That's big on any scale, with a lot of people and objects to keep watch over. And Sundays are particularly busy.\n\nIn a cleverly conceived operation, four men wearing fluorescent vests pulled up at the Louvre in a flat-decked truck at 9:30 on Sunday morning. Quickly setting to work, they raised an extendable ladder to the second storey. Climbing it, they cut through a window, entered the Galerie d'Apollon and, brandishing power tools, helped themselves to nine exquisite objects.\n\nWhat we know about the Louvre jewellery heist Here are the details on the items stolen in the Louvre heist that unfolded in broad daylight in Paris.\n\nThe objects taken were France's royal jewels, formerly belonging to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, Napoleon III's wife and arts patron.\n\nThis is where it gets tricky for the thieves: What can you do with these priceless objects? They can't wear them \u2014 too big and glitzy to go unnoticed \u2014 and they can't sell them legitimately as images of them are all over the internet.\n\nThe best-case scenario, from the thieves' perspective, is to break them down, melt the precious metals and sell the gems separately.\n\nEmpress Eugenie's crown, which the perpetrators took and subsequently dropped as they fled the scene on motor scooters, contains eight gold eagles, 1,354 brilliant-cut diamonds, 1,136 rose-cut diamonds and 56 emeralds. In short, this amounts to a sizeable stash of individual gems to try and sell.\n\nTiming is everything\n\nFor the Louvre, any heist is a major blow. It calls into question their security, both electronic and human. Five security staff were nearby and acted to protect visitors, and the alarms did ring, but the entire heist was completed within seven minutes.\n\nTiming is crucial with heists.\n\nIn 2019, an 18-karat gold toilet titled America (2016), from the artist Maurizio Cattelan, was stolen from Blenheim Palace, England. It was taken in five and a half minutes. It weighed 98 kilograms and was fully functioning. In other words, the two men who took it (and were later caught and served prison sentences for their crimes) worked quickly and efficiently. At the time of the theft, as gold bullion it was estimated to be valued at $6 million.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan's 18-karat gold toilet, titled America, was stolen in 2019. It weighed 98 kilograms. (AP)\n\nVan Gogh's painting The Parsonage Garden at Neunen in Spring (1884) was stolen from the Singer Laren Museum, in the Netherlands, during its 2020 COVID closure. It was recovered in late 2023 after an investigation by Dutch art detective Arthur Brand.\n\nThe 2017 theft of two Gottfried Lindauer paintings from Auckland's International Art Centre took just a few minutes to complete. The thieves ram-raided the front window of the auction house where the paintings, valued at $NZ1 million ($882,000), were displayed. The portraits were recovered five years later through an intermediary, with only minor damage.\n\nRecovering the stolen\n\nThe National Gallery of Victoria's Picasso painting Weeping Woman (1937) was famously taken by the Australian Cultural Terrorists in 1986 \u2014 but only noticed as missing two days later.\n\nRecovered just over two weeks later, the painting was left for the gallery staff to collect in a locker at Spencer Street railway station. The motivation behind the theft was to highlight the lack of financial support given to Victorian artists, but the true identity of the thieves remains a mystery.\n\nPicasso's The Weeping Woman (1937) was stolen from the NGV by the Australian Cultural Terrorists in 1986. (AAP: Joe Castro)\n\nIn 1986, 26 paintings of religious subjects were stolen from the gallery at the Benedictine Monastery at New Norcia, Western Australia.\n\nThe thieves were poor planners: They hadn't factored in that three men and the stash of paintings couldn't fit into a Ford Falcon. The paintings were cut from their frames, ostensibly butchered. One was completely destroyed. The thieves were caught and charged.\n\nWhere to next for the thief?\n\nRecovery of objects from heists is low. It's impossible to put a number on, but some say art recoveries globally are possibly as low as 10 per cent.\n\nPaintings are more difficult to sell on \u2014 you can't change their physical appearance to the point of not being recognised.\n\nHowever, with objects such as the gold toilet or jewels, the precious materials and gems can be repurposed. Time will tell if the Napoleonic jewels will be recovered.\n\nNever say never. The Mona Lisa (1503), undoubtedly the main attraction at the Louvre, was stolen in 1911 and recovered two years later. The thief, Vincenzo Peruggia, was an Italian handyman working at the Louvre and was caught trying to sell it.\n\nThe Mona Lisa, at the Louvre, was stolen in 1911 and recovered two years later. (Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes)\n\nThis latest heist at the Louvre highlights the vulnerability of objects in public collections \u2014 the irony being they're often gifted to such institutions for safekeeping.\n\nThose who guard objects are usually paid a minimum wage and yet they are tasked with a huge responsibility. When budget cuts are made, it's often security staff that are reduced \u2014 such as the Art Gallery of New South Wales's announcement just last week.\n\nThe thieves on Sunday knew what they were after and why. We aren't privy to their motivation. We know the stolen jewels are part of France's history and are irreplaceable. Their theft denies visitors of experiencing them individually for their beauty and craftsmanship, as well as collectively within the context of France's history.\n\nBut part of me can't help thinking how the French were partial to helping themselves to artworks and precious objects belonging to others. So perhaps this could be a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nPenelope Jackson is an adjunct research associate at the School of Social Work and Arts at Charles Sturt University.

(ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nProduction down in Queensland\n\nWith unreliable strawberry supplies in recent weeks, prices in the shops have edged up.\n\nStrawberries are currently retailing in the major supermarkets for around $4.50 to $5 for a 250g punnet.\n\nThat is much lower than the heady prices of $11.99/250g in Canberra in June 2022, but up from $2.50 a punnet more recently.\n\nQueensland Strawberry Growers Association president Adrian Schultz said weather extremes had resulted in a 20-30 per cent drop in yield during the winter/spring season.\n\nAdrian Schultz says hot weather is ending the Queensland season earlier than usual. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nThe start of the season was plagued by weeks of rain and damaged fruit that had to be thrown away.\n\nMr Schultz said a \"very, very hot and dry\" few days in September and hot days in October were ending the season earlier than usual in key growing areas.\n\n\"That finished off a lot of farms up here, there just was no fruit left. It got the plants to shut down,\" he said.\n\n\" It could have an effect on prices over the next couple of weeks until production goes back to normal. \"\n\nHydroponic farms in Queensland, which have more control over water and nutrition by growing strawberries on tabletops, have been able to continue growing fruit for longer.\n\nRipening has been delayed in Victoria because of cold weather. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nSlower ripening in the south\n\nMr Gallace plants his strawberries at Main Ridge in Victoria between April and June, and usually starts picking from October.\n\nBut this year the berries are ripening later.\n\n\"Strawberries like warm nights and we haven't had many warm nights over the last few months, so we're behind by about two weeks in terms of our season down here,\" he said.\n\nHe is not the only one, with growers in the Yarra Valley and other southern regions also delayed.\n\n\"Everyone is behind and it's just been purely because the climate, the cold winter has just set those plants back a little bit,\" Mr Gallace said.\n\nBut he said it would not be long until picking ramped up.\n\n\"Probably another week or two away, the price will start to ease in the supermarkets and your local fruit and veg shop,\" he said.\n\nHot, dry weather in the north and cold weather in the south have disrupted strawberry supplies. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nSupply to 'return to normal' soon\n\nMajor supermarkets Woolworths and Coles have placed signs on the shelves alerting shoppers to the shortages.\n\n\"Due to weather impacts on crops, we are experiencing some impact on strawberry supply,\" a Woolworths spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said there would be more strawberries on the shelves soon.\n\n\"We are working closely with our suppliers and anticipate these impacts will only be short-term and supply will soon return to normal,\" the spokesperson said.",

(Supplied)\n\nPremier Chris Minns said his government was reversing one of the \"worst decisions\" of the previous Coalition government, which he said had \"foisted\" a private hospital model on the people of the Northern Beaches.\n\n\"Our state's acute hospital services, that provide lifesaving care to the people of New South Wales, should not be privatised,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks to this decision, no hospital in NSW will be.\"\n\nMr Minns confirmed this morning the government would pay $190 million to take over the hospital. (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\nHe also paid tribute Joe Massa's parents, Elouise and Danny, who have campaigned for the hospital to return to public hands.\n\n\"Their advocacy will leave a lasting legacy for every patient and every family who relies on our public health system,\" Mr Minns said.\n\nMs Massa said her son's case was not isolated and his love had given the couple the \"fierce determination\" to fight for the change to the operating model of the hospital.\n\n\"We don't want anyone else going through what we have gone through \u2014 the absolute torment, the heartbreak,\" Ms Massa told the media, while holding Joe's shoes.\n\n\"I believe it's also Joe's love that has guided the government to ensure that public safety is at the forefront of all decision-making at Northern Beaches Hospital and beyond.\n\n\" Joe will leave behind footprints that we will never forget in NSW. \"\n\n'Complex' change\n\nThe Northern Beaches Hospital. (ABC News: Nicolle Chettle)\n\nIn September, the government announced NSW Health staff had been embedded within the hospital, to begin its transition to public hands.\n\nHowever, Health Minister Ryan Park has repeatedly spoken of the difficulties in taking back a \"public portion\" of the hospital, while leaving another portion for a private provider.\n\nAMA NSW president Kathryn Austin urged the government to explain what the move to making the hospital a \"fully public operation with 'private services'\" will mean in practice for patients, staff and service providers.\n\nMr Park said on Tuesday the operating model and partnerships with private providers at the hospital had not yet been settled but he did not foreshadow a reduction in services.\n\nNSW Health Minister Ryan Park with Elouise and Danny Massa. (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)\n\nMr Park said navigating the change in hospital structure and management had been \"complex\" and \"challenging\" and the deal was an \"important step forward\".\n\n\"It [the deal] marks the beginning, not the end, of what will be a change in model of the way in which that hospital works,\" he said.\n\nHe said he did not have an overall cost to the government for taking over the hospital.\n\nTreasurer Daniel Mookhey said the $190 million deal would just cover the money spent to build Healthscope's facilities, not past or future profit, in a departure from the initial contract.\n\nThe in-principle agreement will now go to Healthscope lenders group for approval, Mr Mookhey said.\n\nMany of the hospital's facilities are shared, creating significant challenges when it comes to the division of assets.\n\nWhile bringing the whole hospital into public control will eliminate that uncertainty, it will raise more questions about the future of the specialist services currently offered at the facility.\n\nNSW Nurses and Midwives' Association general secretary Shaye Candish said it had been an \"extremely unsettling and stressful time\" for staff at the hospital and welcomed the proposed deal.",

And in the process, what we will see at this site, at the Osborne Naval Shipyard, is the building of our nuclear-powered submarines. And in time, this workplace will have 7000 employees working on submarines \u2026 and it will be the largest, the most complex industrial facility in our country,\u201d Marles told the press.\n\nEarlier today, in the first bilateral meeting between Australia and the US since Albanese took office, Trump vowed to uphold the AUKUS defence pact to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\n\u201cIt will be a great achievement for our country. At the end of it, what we will have is the single biggest increase in our military capability since the establishment of the Navy more than a century ago. It will be profoundly important for Australia\u2019s national security,\u201d Marles said.",

        "text": "The property sector also continues to shrink, with a 13.9 per cent fall in property investment relative to the same period last year. New home prices fell 0.4 per cent from August and secondary market housing dropped 0.6 per cent. New home prices are now more than 10 per cent off their peaks and \u201cused\u201d homes nearly 20 per cent. Prices are now back to their levels before the pandemic and before Xi introduced the \u201cthree red lines\u201d policy that blew up the market. Loading September was the worst month for the property market this year, which will cause some concern at the plenum as it is the major factor behind the weak levels of consumer confidence and spending that have resulted in deflation over the past two and a half years. Nominal GDP growth of 3.7 per cent underscores how significant the rate of deflation has become and how threatening it is to any rebound in domestic confidence and consumption. At the heart of the weaknesses in the domestic economy is the continuing slump in the property sector, which Beijing has been unable to arrest.\n\nThe outcomes from the plenum will be closely watched to see if the party leadership plans to do something more substantial to boost domestic consumption than the piecemeal and relatively ineffective measures it has tried to date. The strongest growth areas within China\u2019s economy were, as expected, those targeted by (and subsidised by) the last five-year plan: electric vehicles, computers, communications and other electronic equipment manufacturing, ships and aircraft. The 16 per cent growth, year-on-year, in the value-add of the auto sector highlights both the unbalanced nature of the economy and the structural imbalances within it. Even though few, if any, of China\u2019s auto manufacturers generate profits, they are producing a swelling tide of vehicles which \u2013 with domestic demand soft and endless cycles of price wars in the domestic market \u2013 have been pouring into export markets where there are better margins. That is creating tension and pushback from within those markets, with other countries starting to move to protect their own auto industries from China\u2019s cheap electric vehicle exports.\n\nThe auto sector is one of the industries targeted by Beijing in its campaign against \u201cinvolution,\u201d or over-capacity, and the cut-throat competition that is helping to drive deflation. The sub-economic nature of those exports, and exports of other manufactured products also suffering from involution, shows up in the trade data, where growth in the volume of China\u2019s exports is significantly outpacing the increase in their value. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are producing cars at breakneck speed. Credit: Bloomberg Other sectors earmarked for consolidation are China\u2019s coal and steel industries, both of which produced less last month as demand weakened and companies started to fall into line with Beijing\u2019s demand to reduce overcapacity. Coal production was down 1.8 per cent year-on-year and steel output 4.6 per cent, which isn\u2019t good news for Australia\u2019s iron ore miners. The increased reliance on exports for growth makes China vulnerable. It has largely shrugged off the direct effects of Trump\u2019s trade wars, but the growing resistance to its exports elsewhere is a threat to its mercantilist strategy.\n\nIt needs a better balance between domestic activity and external trade, which is something the leadership has no doubt grappled with ahead of the plenum, although Xi is expected to double down on his long-term ambition of global domination of advanced manufacturing, along with self-sufficiency in the targeted sectors and their supply chains. Loading The plenum isn\u2019t expected to set GDP growth targets for the next five years \u2013 the last one didn\u2019t \u2013 but China needs growth of only about 4.5 per cent in the December quarter to meet the target of \u201caround 5 per cent\u201d that it began this year with. It needs growth of around 4.7 per cent or 4.8 per cent a year for the next five years to meet Xi\u2019s ambition, set as part of the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy \u2013 the plan that has driven China\u2019s global leadership in electric vehicles, solar cells and shipping and seen dramatic increases in its development of artificial intelligence, semiconductors, a domestic aviation industry, biotech and other strategic sectors \u2013 of doubling the size of economy by 2035, relative to its size in 2020 when the strategy was developed. Trump\u2019s trade wars could complicate China\u2019s ability to achieve that goal, even though the US now represents a market for only about 10 per cent of China\u2019s exports.\n\nChina thrived in a free trade environment, but Trump\u2019s tariffs on everyone is forcing other economies to become more defensive and protectionist. That adds to the need for China\u2019s to rebalance the relationship between domestic consumption and exports. Loading Trump and Xi are supposed to meet on October 31, with Trump identifying rare earths, fentanyl and soybeans as his priorities. Tensions over China\u2019s dominance of rare earths flared after China \u2013 in response to a US tightening of restrictions on sales of advanced semiconductors to Chinese companies \u2013 tightened and broadened its own export restrictions on rare earths and permanent magnets, which are essential to most advanced manufactures and critical to many military technologies. Trump then threatened a 100 per cent tariff on all imports from China. Even though Trump struck a deal with Anthony Albanese overnight to get access to Australia\u2019s plentiful reserves of rare earths, it will take many years before the US can shed its dependence on China\u2019s rare earths and rare earth magnets and the vulnerability that has created.",

        "text": "Gregory Porter\u2019s voice is like a log fire on a winter\u2019s night. It doesn\u2019t just radiate warmth, it has a comfort factor. It\u2019s the voice of someone who\u2019s worked out a thing or two about this very temporary exercise called life, and wants to ease the suffering and spread a little beneficence with a generosity of heart that\u2019s the opposite of those people who win talent quests by impressing. Porter has bigger fish to fry than merely impressing. A mere nine years ago he was at the old Basement. Now he\u2019s packing out the Concert Hall with fans who know all the songs, having been seduced by the voice of this barrel-chested man in the trademark hat, who can fleetingly remind you of singers ranging from Nat King Cole to Marvin Gaye, yet sounds only like himself. He lets jazz flow into soul as naturally as two rivers meeting, so it\u2019s impossible to define where they merge. Gregory Porter in action on stage at the Opera House. Credit: Johannes Napp Most of the songs are his own, with lyrics about coping, loving, hoping and improving. The latter\u2019s quite an attractive idea, given most of us seem to believe that bemoaning our lot is a form of conversation. You feel the truth of the magnanimity with Porter, not just via the lyrics and the amusing between-song chat, but via the voice itself, which seems to proclaim that goodness is possible, and you leave the two-hour show briefly believing it. His long-term quartet has been augmented by organist Ondrej Pivec, who maximises the inherent drama of a Hammond B-3, and provides another soloing voice to join tenor saxophonist Tivon Pennicott and pianist Chip Crawford. Bassist Jahmal Nichols anchors the music, while also providing the night\u2019s most engrossing solo feature, which builds into a groove so wicked it must be barely legal, and then morphs into two rare covers: The Temptations\u2019 My Girl and Papa Was a Rolling Stone. Drummer Emanuel Harrold remains the joker in the pack: unusually busy for the soul side of the idiom (if not the jazz), and ensuring the music is energised and studded with surprises.\n\nPorter\u2019s anthemic Musical Genocide drops away to just Crawford\u2019s piano, which slips into Waltzing Matilda. Although Porter doesn\u2019t sing it, the audience does, and what could easily have been corny is actually quite touching. More moving is Porter\u2019s Water Under Bridges, ostensibly about a break-up; more pertinently about how his brother helped him cope: a brother who died during the pandemic. Sung with only piano accompaniment this allows us to immerse ourselves in his voice\u2019s richness. Seldom does he unleash its full magnificence, but when he does, as on the spiritual Wade in the Water, you are physically pushed back by its power. The sound was second-rate to start, and never became quite as sharply focused as it can be in this room, although it did keep improving, right through to the second (genuinely demanded) encore. MUSIC\n\nKarnivool\n\nEnmore Theatre, October 19\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 When Karnivool guitarist Mark Hosking steps up to the microphone and thanks the audience for sticking with them over the years, he acknowledges that they are a band that require patience from their fans. They postpone shows, he says \u2013 a reference to the fact that this evening\u2019s gig was originally scheduled to take place last July before illness rendered the quintet unable to perform \u2013 and they take years between albums.\n\nKarnivool in full flight at the Enmore Theatre. Credit: Kane Hibberd Indeed, when their new record In Verses comes out in 2026, it will be only their fourth full-length since forming in Perth in 1998 and will drop a whopping 13 years after predecessor Asymmetry. In the here-today-gone-later-today nature of music stardom in 2025, rare is the band that can treat their release schedule with such disdain yet still command the kind of loyalty that enables them to sell out the 2500-capacity Enmore Theatre with ease. That they share a special bond with their audience is obvious. From the genuine glee that flashes across the face of vocalist Ian Kenny when greeting the crowd to the way in which the punters morph into a mass choir during closer New Day and the thundering Themata, the overwhelming feeling from both band and audience is release. Contributing to that sense is the group\u2019s mastery at creating musical tension.\n\nDrummer Steve Judd\u2019s mindbogglingly complex rhythms and the intricate guitar interplay between Hosking and Drew Goddard combine to form a dark, dense, prog-metal symphony that they tease to a thundering climax in the epic Deadman and a gloriously heavy Roquefort. Of the two new tracks Karnivool have released this year they open with one in Drone and put the other, Aozora, third song in. That they do this rather than go for a cheap win by opening with an old favourite like Cote (which appears later in the set) speaks volumes about the confidence of the band and the trust they place in their audience to go along for the ride. After almost three decades, though, those fans know the deal \u2013 Karnivool will march to the beat of their own drum and indulge their musical whims without any care for the demands of the mainstream. In return, they will deliver a masterful show like this. MUSIC\n\nBURNA BOY\n\nQudos Bank Arena, October 18\n\nReviewed by SHAMIM RAZAVI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Burna Boy\u2019s current tour takes him places no African artist has gone before, and his first Sydney headline show is no exception: it\u2019s hard to imagine that Olympic Park has ever hosted a Nigerian party of these proportions, with even the food trucks putting on their best impersonations of jollof rice and swallows. Inside the arena, the mood was authentic Afrofusion: an Afrobeats base with aesthetic influences from the rest of the world.\n\nThat African base was ever present \u2013 in the Yoruba-Pidgin lyrics, in the use of the talking drum and shekere instruments, in the infectious familial informality \u2014 but fused with global elements ranging from Kingston Town rhythms to Ed Sheeran aesthetics straight from the badlands of Ipswich: a sound as global as it is grounded. Burna Boy in full flight at Qudos Bank Arena. Credit: Glenn Pokorny Burna\u2019s studio production is glossy and complicated, which in the hands of a lesser artist might have been a disappointment live. Not so for the African Giant: in his case, less polish and more talent actually improved on his overstuffed recordings. His baritone especially benefited from the concert treatment \u2013 with AutoTune dialled back, we were reminded of the charm and intensity that sets his act apart from his peers. In fact, the a cappella intro to It\u2019s Plenty drops the vocal filters altogether and he sounds properly masterful as a result. The price for this willingness to experiment and mix things up was the occasional misfire. Bank on It was transformed with a smooth-jazz vibe, complete with a sax line straight from the Kenny G songbook: more lounge than Lagos; the CGI screen backdrops were more artificial than intelligent, and the occasional keytar on stage, like an escapee from a wedding band, only highlighted the strange aesthetic choices. Not that anyone seemed to mind, judging by the assortment of audience underwear thrown on stage. Shirtless from the second song, Burna Boy worked that rich voice and charisma hard, building to a closing climax of Ye and Last Last. And yet, for all the heat and magnetism, there was something missing \u2013 a looseness and unrestraint that would have transformed this good night into a great one: the gap between smouldering and fire.\n\nMUSIC\n\nGORDI\n\nPlayhouse, Sydney Opera House, October 17\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Though neither of them occurred during the performance, two medical episodes punctuated this show and told us something about Sophie Payten in both normal and Gordi mode, in medical and musical personas. The lesser of them, told in comic semi-pantomime, concerned Payten at the dentist when one of her songs, Heaven I Know, came on the surgery\u2019s playlist like the universe was helping convince them she really was a musician. On stage, that song built from looped and live vocal layers and slowly accreting instruments until we had an alterna-choir that served as a kind of halo around the simple lines of an ending and acceptance. \u201cYeah, I got older, and we got tired/Heaven I know, that we tried.\u201d Gordi aka Sophie Payten performs at the Sydney Opera House. Credit: Gabrielle Clement More seriously, the other story featured a patient of hers \u2013 Payten completed her medical studies during and immediately after COVID lockdowns \u2013 who confronted news of his imminent death with a level of equanimity that would be beyond most of us, leaving an impact on his young doctor.\n\nThe two songs inspired by this experience were not leaden but rather a flow of warm energy that pushed everything forward and a blend of Elliott Smith and Bon Iver as pure pop immersed in hazy winter. Around these three songs, in material that included all the tracks of her new-ish album, Like Plasticine, and scattered shots from previous releases, Payten/Gordi moved between endings and rebuilding, back and forth from thickened layers to modestly proportioned instrumentation, counter-intuitively guitar-pushed vibrant when crushed and synth-filled solemn when emotionally buoyant, and often distorting her voice through various effects as if not wanting clarity to be confused with truth. Songs found her uncertain on questing love (\u201cDo you care? Do you care?/Don\u2019t make me your peripheral lover\u201d), falling on a failure (\u201cI made available a portion of my heart/Not anymore\u201d) and rising again on the certainty of comfort (\u201cI know the pressure you feel seems relentless/But everything is fleeting, except you and I\u201d). And then, closing with Can We Work It Out, on the horns of a dilemma \u2013 ready to believe, but bracing for regret \u2013 she threw at us the bushiest and brightest song of the night with its solid propulsion and almost fizzing slices of vocals. THEATRE\n\nDAYTIME DEEWANE\n\nRiverside, October 18, until October 25\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 1980s Britain, after racist club bouncers wouldn\u2019t give anyone with brown skin their share of night, a new underground subculture emerged. These were the Daytimers, day parties run by South Asian collectives, where shunned ravers could congregate on their own terms, to their own DJs, dancing to new music blending bass-kicked Bhangra, Asian garage and diaspora-mixed jungle. Azan Ahmed sets his award-winning 2022 play at the last Daytimer party, in London in 1997. Sixteen-year-old Farhan (Ariyan Sharma), wonders whether Islam forbids dancing as he scurries nervously in school uniform towards his first-ever rave. His 20-year-old rude-boy cousin Sadiq (Ashan Kumar), bounces about impatiently in wifebeater vest and chains, breaking into rhapsodies on the dancefloor\u2019s true radical principles of defiance, humanism and transcendent release. Ariyan Sharma and Ashan Kumar are excellent as two cousins on clashing coming-of-age trajectories in Daytime Deewane. Credit: Phil Erbacher Built on the twists in its character foils, Daytime Deewane unfolds as a story about these two very different young Muslim men, each trying to define his means and methods of self-respect against the values and expectations of his heritage. It loses its beat in the last stretch \u2013 the time leap to a reunion scene strikes an off-key chord and leaves us with an ambiguous moral takeaway \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot to rate highly in this play about migration, masculinity and faith. Its two leads go point-for-point in endowing Riverside\u2019s Australian premiere with humour and depth. Sharma gives us signature goof as the duty-bound teenage square, cutting Farhan the weirdest of shapes as an aspirational \u201cpeacock\u201d bro while asking where the prayer room\u2019s at.",

        "text": "Australia is particularly reliant on AWS. The federal government inked a three-year whole-of-government deal in January 2025, giving federal, state and local agencies streamlined access to AWS services. The government has committed $2 billion over the next decade for AWS to build a \u201cTop Secret Cloud\u201d to host the nation\u2019s most sensitive defence and intelligence data. Anthony Albanese at a press conference during the prime minister\u2019s June visit to the Amazon Spheres in Seattle. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen More than 140 Commonwealth, state and territory agencies already rely on AWS for critical services in transport, health, education and tax collection. The root cause of this week\u2019s issue hasn\u2019t yet been identified, though it appears tied to a DNS (Domain Name System) failure within AWS\u2019s US-EAST-1 region, in Virginia. To put it simply, the digital phone book for much of the cloud was broken, and when AWS stumbles, anything or anyone relying on its services stumbles too.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new story. AWS experienced similar outages in 2023 and 2021, when a five-hour disruption prevented customers from accessing airline reservations and payment apps. And just 15 months ago, the CrowdStrike disaster showed us what happens when critical infrastructure software fails at scale. Loading The July 2024 CrowdStrike incident was different in nature, but similar in its sheer impact. CrowdStrike makes cybersecurity software that runs on individual computers and servers to protect them from hackers. A faulty update caused roughly 8.5 million Windows systems to crash simultaneously, triggering an estimated $US10 billion ($15.3 billion) in global damage. Airlines grounded thousands of flights. Hospitals scrambled to access patient records. Supermarkets effectively shut down and emergency services went dark. The two incidents share a troubling pattern: single points of failure causing cascading global chaos.\n\nBut there\u2019s a crucial difference. CrowdStrike affected individual machines that required technicians to manually fix them one by one. Monday\u2019s AWS outage hit centralised infrastructure \u2013 the very foundation upon which modern digital services are built. Checkouts at Coles in New Farm were offline after the CrowdStrike outage of July 19, 2024. Credit: Cameron Atfield The outage underscores the critical role AWS plays in the functioning of the entire internet. And for one provider to have so much influence is a problem when something goes wrong, far beyond just inconveniences for businesses or customers. \u201cWhen a single provider goes dark, critical services go offline with it,\u201d advocacy organisation Article 19 warns. \u201cMedia outlets become inaccessible, secure communication apps stop functioning, and the infrastructure that serves our digital society crumbles.\u201d They have a point. This isn\u2019t just about missing a few hours on social media or not being able to respond to your Tinder match. It\u2019s about systemic fragility in critical infrastructure that increasingly underpins finance, healthcare and ultimately democracy.\n\nTo be fair, cloud computing has brought real benefits, and has been one of the most transformative technologies over the last decade, alongside AI. It\u2019s made technology cheaper and more accessible, allowing start-ups to compete without buying expensive servers. It\u2019s enabled services to scale rapidly to meet demand. And companies like AWS do invest heavily in redundancy \u2013 back-up systems designed to kick in when something fails. They just don\u2019t always work. So, what should we do differently? First, regulators and governments must treat cloud infrastructure like the critical public utility it has become. The internet is too important not to. We don\u2019t allow one company to control 30 per cent of electricity generation for good reason and the same logic should apply to the digital infrastructure that powers modern life. This doesn\u2019t mean breaking up tech companies, necessarily, but it does mean greater oversight, standards and accountability.\n\nSecond, governments need to mandate genuine redundancy. And not just within a single provider\u2019s ecosystem, but across different providers. If your back-up generator runs on the same power grid as your main system, it\u2019s not really a back-up. Loading Third, we need transparency. When AWS goes down, the public deserves to know immediately what failed, why, what\u2019s at risk, and when full service will return. AWS did provide regular updates overnight, but the current system is inadequate for infrastructure this critical. None of this is straightforward or easy, but the status quo isn\u2019t working either. The internet has become too important to be this fragile, and too important to be held hostage by any single company.",

In fact, Australia pays among the lowest tariffs,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nTense moment with US ambassador Kevin Rudd\n\nThe main moment of tension came as a journalist asked Trump's thoughts on disparaging comments made by Australia's ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd.\n\n\n\n\n\nRudd called Trump the \"most destructive president in history\" in a 2020 social media post, one of several tweets deleted after Trump won the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump turned to ask Albanese what had been said, before changing his mind, saying: \"Don't tell me.\"\n\n\n\nRudd was in the room at the time, and after trying to explain, was quickly cut off by Trump, who said: \"I don't like you either, I don't, and probably never will.\" Albanese laughed during the exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the meeting concluded, Rudd was overheard apologising to Trump off-camera, with the US president reportedly replying \"all is forgiven\".\n\n\n\nTrump praises PM as 'my friend'\n\nTrump gushed over his \"friend\" Albanese, during a very friendly first bilateral meeting between the pair, stating he was doing a \"fantastic job\" as prime minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been long-term, longtime allies, and I would say there's never been anybody better,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked to compare Albanese to previous prime ministers Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull, who were more politically aligned, Trump said it \"wouldn't be fair\".\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to compare one with the other, but they really have a great prime minister,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese joked he would use Trump's remarks in campaign ads at the next federal election in 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feeling was mutual, with Albanese praising Trump's work on a Middle East ceasefire as \"an extraordinary achievement\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US president said he had been extended an invite to visit Australia, which he was \"considering\".\n\n\n\n",

The site suffered outages in 2021 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to documentation on the AWS website, the US-EAST-1 site is often the default region for many AWS services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked for comment, AWS directed Reuters to its status page. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nDependency on 'fragile infrastructures'\n\nThe problem highlights how interconnected everyday digital services have become and their reliance on a small number of global cloud providers, with one glitch wreaking havoc on business and day-to-day life, experts and academics said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Moore, a global cybersecurity adviser at European cybersecurity firm ESET, said: \"This outage once again highlights the dependency we have on relatively fragile infrastructures.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Lloyd Bank, Bank of Scotland and telecom service providers Vodafone and BT were all hit, according to Downdetector's UK website, as was UK tax, payments and customs authority HMRC's website.\n\n\n\nNishanth Sastry, director of research at the University of Surrey's Department of Computer Science, said: \"The main reason for this issue is that all these big companies have relied on just one service.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOokla, which owns Downdetector, said over four million users reported issues due to the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Griffin, US cyber practice leader at insurance broker McGill and Partners, said: \"For major businesses, hours of cloud downtime translate to millions in lost productivity and revenue.\"\n\n\n\nThe websites and apps affected by the AWS outage\n\nOokla reported at least 1,000 companies were affected by the AWS outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disruption also affected streaming platforms, including Amazon's Prime Video service and Disney+, as well as Perplexity AI, the Fortnite game, Airbnb and Duolingo.\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile telephone services and messaging apps Signal and Whatsapp were affected in Europe, according to Downdetector.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence start-up Perplexity, crypto exchange Coinbase, and trading platform Robinhood also experienced outages linked to AWS, as did Amazon's own services.\n\n\n\nAlthough there's no evidence of a cyberattack, the scale of the breakdown fuelled speculation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity expert Rafe Pilling said such incidents are understandable given AWS\u2019s vast and complex reach, warning that even minor issues can trigger major global disruption.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australia has some of the richest deposits of mineral sands and rare earth minerals in the world, and the US wants access to them, hoping to counter China's dominance of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what the term rare earths refers to and why they're not actually that rare.\n\n\n\nWhat are rare earth minerals?\n\nRare earths are a group of 17 elements in the periodic table, most of them known as lanthanides.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're used in consumer electronics, weapons, electric vehicles, medical equipment and robots for example, and often relate to new technologies.\n\n\n\nThey're crucial too for the green energy transition. Solar and wind energy and electric vehicles all depend on rare earth elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Vlado Vivoda from the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland told SBS News earlier in the year that despite the name, they're not actually scarce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So a lot of them are not actually rare, but they're hard to mine and even harder to separate and process safely. So that's what makes them geopolitically important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRare earths are tightly bound together with other elements in nature, so separating them is a complex process often involving at least 50 stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch operations are expensive, labour-intensive and often environmentally damaging.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Most countries have left the work to China, which Vivoda says emerged as a key player in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China appeared as the ideal candidate to take in some of that industry, to do it at home with a bit more lax environmental regulations. And it was the cheapest place to do all this. Plus China had some of the largest reserves as well of rare earths.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina now controls the majority of the rare earths supply chain, accounting for around 70 per cent of mining and 90 per cent of processing, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lion's share is unlikely to change; however, over the next five years, Australia is on track to become the second-biggest producer of rare earth elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, China threatened to halt exports of rare earth minerals to the United States, amid an ongoing tariff row, after which Trump funded billions of dollars of incentives for investors in the minerals, as part of his 'big, beautiful bill'.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, Albanese announced an initial investment of $1.2 billion to set up a strategic reserve of critical minerals, including rare earths, which he described as key to Australia's national security \"in a time of global uncertainty\".\n\n\n\nFarmers gathered this month to protest against a pipeline to enable the Donald Mineral Sands project, south-east of Minyip in Victoria. Source: Supplied The government has also agreed to loan over $2.6 billion to two firms to establish separate refineries \u2014 Arafura Rare Earths mine in the Northern Territory and Iluka Resources in Western Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australia's push to become a bigger player in the global race for rare earth minerals relies on digging up prime agricultural land, which has led to pushback from some farmers.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A \"record-breaking\" flu season has left medical experts worried about Australia's vaccination rates, with GPs warning declining figures should serve as a \"wake-up call\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 410,000 lab-confirmed cases have been reported so far in 2025 across the country, eclipsing the previous record of 365,000 last year, according to the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a record we want to be breaking,\" said RACGP president Michael Wright, urging Australia to boost vaccination rates.\n\n\n\nHow bad is 2025 for flu cases?\n\nThe RACGP described 2025 as \"the worst year on record\" for influenza cases adjusted for population, with around 1.5 per cent of Australians experiencing a notifiable flu infection, or 1,525 lab-confirmed cases per 100,000 people this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames McCaw, a professor in mathematical biology at the University of Melbourne, said the true number of infections is unknown, because it's likely fewer than 1 in 100 people infected with the virus become reported cases.\n\n\n\n\"Many people, appropriately, self-manage their illness or are supported by their GP but not tested,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Case counts, or notifications, depend very strongly on peoples' choices on whether or not to seek medical attention and on the choices that GPs make to test or not to test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These factors change every year, with generally increasing trends over the past decade \u2014 so people are becoming more and more likely to end up recorded as a case given that there were infected.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Influenza cases surge: time to get vaccinated say experts SBS News 06:40 English\n\nMcCaw pointed to reports compiled by Flutracking, which asks people to monitor for respiratory illness, which he said showed respiratory illness \u2014 caused by influenza and many other respiratory viruses \u2014 was \"not at all unusual in 2025\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taken together, what this suggests is that in 2025 influenza transmission was fairly typical,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The higher number of reported cases likely reflects increased care-seeking behaviour and/or an increase in GPs' tendency to take a sample and submit it for testing - both good things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The increased case numbers are good news in that we may have a slightly better picture of how the virus is spreading.\"\n\n\n\nDr Catriona Vi Nguyen-Robertson, an immunologist and lecturer in science communication at the University of Melbourne, said a 10 per cent increase in flu cases was \"highly concerning\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut whether it was the \"worst\" year depends on what is being measured, for example, the viruses' impact or transmissibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These numbers are highlighting ... [that] transmission and spread among people this year was up,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And so if by worse, you mean you know, more people are being impacted, but perhaps it's not the most severe it's been, but a lot of people are being affected, then I think that's one thing to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And then ... if fewer people are getting it but they're sicker, are we calling that worse?\"\n\n\n\nHow many people were hospitalised with flu?\n\nIn NSW, the number of people admitted to hospital for \"influenza-like illness\" was broadly the same during the past winter season compared to last year, though admissions through July-August 2024 were notably higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Queensland, hospitalisations for flu were slightly higher in 2024 compared to 2025, according to state health department figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther states and territories' reports differ in reporting practices. SBS News has sought national data on hospitalisations from the federal Department of Health.\n\n\n\nDrop in vaccination rates a concern\n\nWright said while flu notification rates were soaring, vaccine rates had plateaued. This was even among children and the elderly, who are most at risk from the flu.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a quarter of Australian children between six months and five years were vaccinated this year, the lowest rate since 2021, while 60 per cent of those over 65 were vaccinated, the lowest since 2020, the RACGP said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWright said he hoped to see free childhood vaccinations via nasal spray \u2014 which Queensland, NSW, South Australia and Western Australia have backed \u2014 rolled out across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said vaccination rates can be stalled due to childhood fears of needles and parental distress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Needle-free vaccinations make such a difference.\"\n\n\n\nNguyen-Robertson put the increase in flu cases down to a number of factors, including more people returning to work from home-based positions and the decrease in vaccinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine hesitancy that came after years of COVID-19 lockdowns was also at play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think COVID really brought out the extremes in a way, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And so I think we're more aware of vaccine hesitancy, not that it wasn't a problem before, but it's clear that a lot of people are hesitant around vaccines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCaw said there would be fewer deaths and health system impacts because of influenza if vaccine coverage was higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By getting vaccinated you may also help slow the spread of the virus through the community, thereby indirectly reducing the risk to those most vulnerable, including the elderly and infants.\"\n\n\n\n",

But I want to make a point that we\u2019ve been consistently saying: that this is a program which is very much in the interests of the United States, as it is in the interests of Australia, as it is in the interests of the United Kingdom.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, left, greets Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House Credit: AP\n\nThe USS North Dakota, a Virginia-class submarine of the type Australia would acquire under the AUKUS deal.\n\n\u201cAnd AUKUS is moving at a pace. When you meet these workers around here, you can touch, feel and see AUKUS occurring. And in the process, what we will see at this site, at the Osborne Naval Shipyard, is the building of our nuclear-powered submarines. And in time, this workplace will have 7000 employees working on submarines \u2026 and it will be the largest, the most complex industrial facility in our country,\u201d Marles told the press.\n\nEarlier today, in the first bilateral meeting between Australia and the US since Albanese took office, Trump vowed to uphold the AUKUS defence pact to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\n\u201cIt will be a great achievement for our country. At the end of it, what we will have is the single biggest increase in our military capability since the establishment of the Navy more than a century ago. It will be profoundly important for Australia\u2019s national security,\u201d Marles said.",

Nominal GDP growth of 3.7 per cent underscores how significant the rate of deflation has become and how threatening it is to any rebound in domestic confidence and consumption. At the heart of the weaknesses in the domestic economy is the continuing slump in the property sector, which Beijing has been unable to arrest.\n\nThe outcomes from the plenum will be closely watched to see if the party leadership plans to do something more substantial to boost domestic consumption than the piecemeal and relatively ineffective measures it has tried to date. The strongest growth areas within China\u2019s economy were, as expected, those targeted by (and subsidised by) the last five-year plan: electric vehicles, computers, communications and other electronic equipment manufacturing, ships and aircraft. The 16 per cent growth, year-on-year, in the value-add of the auto sector highlights both the unbalanced nature of the economy and the structural imbalances within it. Even though few, if any, of China\u2019s auto manufacturers generate profits, they are producing a swelling tide of vehicles which \u2013 with domestic demand soft and endless cycles of price wars in the domestic market \u2013 have been pouring into export markets where there are better margins. That is creating tension and pushback from within those markets, with other countries starting to move to protect their own auto industries from China\u2019s cheap electric vehicle exports.\n\nThe auto sector is one of the industries targeted by Beijing in its campaign against \u201cinvolution,\u201d or over-capacity, and the cut-throat competition that is helping to drive deflation. The sub-economic nature of those exports, and exports of other manufactured products also suffering from involution, shows up in the trade data, where growth in the volume of China\u2019s exports is significantly outpacing the increase in their value. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are producing cars at breakneck speed. Credit: Bloomberg Other sectors earmarked for consolidation are China\u2019s coal and steel industries, both of which produced less last month as demand weakened and companies started to fall into line with Beijing\u2019s demand to reduce overcapacity. Coal production was down 1.8 per cent year-on-year and steel output 4.6 per cent, which isn\u2019t good news for Australia\u2019s iron ore miners. The increased reliance on exports for growth makes China vulnerable. It has largely shrugged off the direct effects of Trump\u2019s trade wars, but the growing resistance to its exports elsewhere is a threat to its mercantilist strategy.\n\nIt needs a better balance between domestic activity and external trade, which is something the leadership has no doubt grappled with ahead of the plenum, although Xi is expected to double down on his long-term ambition of global domination of advanced manufacturing, along with self-sufficiency in the targeted sectors and their supply chains. Loading The plenum isn\u2019t expected to set GDP growth targets for the next five years \u2013 the last one didn\u2019t \u2013 but China needs growth of only about 4.5 per cent in the December quarter to meet the target of \u201caround 5 per cent\u201d that it began this year with. It needs growth of around 4.7 per cent or 4.8 per cent a year for the next five years to meet Xi\u2019s ambition, set as part of the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy \u2013 the plan that has driven China\u2019s global leadership in electric vehicles, solar cells and shipping and seen dramatic increases in its development of artificial intelligence, semiconductors, a domestic aviation industry, biotech and other strategic sectors \u2013 of doubling the size of economy by 2035, relative to its size in 2020 when the strategy was developed. Trump\u2019s trade wars could complicate China\u2019s ability to achieve that goal, even though the US now represents a market for only about 10 per cent of China\u2019s exports.\n\nChina thrived in a free trade environment, but Trump\u2019s tariffs on everyone is forcing other economies to become more defensive and protectionist. That adds to the need for China\u2019s to rebalance the relationship between domestic consumption and exports. Loading Trump and Xi are supposed to meet on October 31, with Trump identifying rare earths, fentanyl and soybeans as his priorities. Tensions over China\u2019s dominance of rare earths flared after China \u2013 in response to a US tightening of restrictions on sales of advanced semiconductors to Chinese companies \u2013 tightened and broadened its own export restrictions on rare earths and permanent magnets, which are essential to most advanced manufactures and critical to many military technologies. Trump then threatened a 100 per cent tariff on all imports from China. Even though Trump struck a deal with Anthony Albanese overnight to get access to Australia\u2019s plentiful reserves of rare earths, it will take many years before the US can shed its dependence on China\u2019s rare earths and rare earth magnets and the vulnerability that has created.",

        "text": "Gregory Porter\u2019s voice is like a log fire on a winter\u2019s night. It doesn\u2019t just radiate warmth, it has a comfort factor. It\u2019s the voice of someone who\u2019s worked out a thing or two about this very temporary exercise called life, and wants to ease the suffering and spread a little beneficence with a generosity of heart that\u2019s the opposite of those people who win talent quests by impressing. Porter has bigger fish to fry than merely impressing. A mere nine years ago he was at the old Basement. Now he\u2019s packing out the Concert Hall with fans who know all the songs, having been seduced by the voice of this barrel-chested man in the trademark hat, who can fleetingly remind you of singers ranging from Nat King Cole to Marvin Gaye, yet sounds only like himself. He lets jazz flow into soul as naturally as two rivers meeting, so it\u2019s impossible to define where they merge. Gregory Porter in action on stage at the Opera House. Credit: Johannes Napp Most of the songs are his own, with lyrics about coping, loving, hoping and improving. The latter\u2019s quite an attractive idea, given most of us seem to believe that bemoaning our lot is a form of conversation. You feel the truth of the magnanimity with Porter, not just via the lyrics and the amusing between-song chat, but via the voice itself, which seems to proclaim that goodness is possible, and you leave the two-hour show briefly believing it. His long-term quartet has been augmented by organist Ondrej Pivec, who maximises the inherent drama of a Hammond B-3, and provides another soloing voice to join tenor saxophonist Tivon Pennicott and pianist Chip Crawford. Bassist Jahmal Nichols anchors the music, while also providing the night\u2019s most engrossing solo feature, which builds into a groove so wicked it must be barely legal, and then morphs into two rare covers: The Temptations\u2019 My Girl and Papa Was a Rolling Stone. Drummer Emanuel Harrold remains the joker in the pack: unusually busy for the soul side of the idiom (if not the jazz), and ensuring the music is energised and studded with surprises.\n\nPorter\u2019s anthemic Musical Genocide drops away to just Crawford\u2019s piano, which slips into Waltzing Matilda. Although Porter doesn\u2019t sing it, the audience does, and what could easily have been corny is actually quite touching. More moving is Porter\u2019s Water Under Bridges, ostensibly about a break-up; more pertinently about how his brother helped him cope: a brother who died during the pandemic. Sung with only piano accompaniment this allows us to immerse ourselves in his voice\u2019s richness. Seldom does he unleash its full magnificence, but when he does, as on the spiritual Wade in the Water, you are physically pushed back by its power. The sound was second-rate to start, and never became quite as sharply focused as it can be in this room, although it did keep improving, right through to the second (genuinely demanded) encore. MUSIC\n\nKarnivool\n\nEnmore Theatre, October 19\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 When Karnivool guitarist Mark Hosking steps up to the microphone and thanks the audience for sticking with them over the years, he acknowledges that they are a band that require patience from their fans. They postpone shows, he says \u2013 a reference to the fact that this evening\u2019s gig was originally scheduled to take place last July before illness rendered the quintet unable to perform \u2013 and they take years between albums.\n\nKarnivool in full flight at the Enmore Theatre. Credit: Kane Hibberd Indeed, when their new record In Verses comes out in 2026, it will be only their fourth full-length since forming in Perth in 1998 and will drop a whopping 13 years after predecessor Asymmetry. In the here-today-gone-later-today nature of music stardom in 2025, rare is the band that can treat their release schedule with such disdain yet still command the kind of loyalty that enables them to sell out the 2500-capacity Enmore Theatre with ease. That they share a special bond with their audience is obvious. From the genuine glee that flashes across the face of vocalist Ian Kenny when greeting the crowd to the way in which the punters morph into a mass choir during closer New Day and the thundering Themata, the overwhelming feeling from both band and audience is release. Contributing to that sense is the group\u2019s mastery at creating musical tension.\n\nDrummer Steve Judd\u2019s mindbogglingly complex rhythms and the intricate guitar interplay between Hosking and Drew Goddard combine to form a dark, dense, prog-metal symphony that they tease to a thundering climax in the epic Deadman and a gloriously heavy Roquefort. Of the two new tracks Karnivool have released this year they open with one in Drone and put the other, Aozora, third song in. That they do this rather than go for a cheap win by opening with an old favourite like Cote (which appears later in the set) speaks volumes about the confidence of the band and the trust they place in their audience to go along for the ride. After almost three decades, though, those fans know the deal \u2013 Karnivool will march to the beat of their own drum and indulge their musical whims without any care for the demands of the mainstream. In return, they will deliver a masterful show like this. MUSIC\n\nBURNA BOY\n\nQudos Bank Arena, October 18\n\nReviewed by SHAMIM RAZAVI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Burna Boy\u2019s current tour takes him places no African artist has gone before, and his first Sydney headline show is no exception: it\u2019s hard to imagine that Olympic Park has ever hosted a Nigerian party of these proportions, with even the food trucks putting on their best impersonations of jollof rice and swallows. Inside the arena, the mood was authentic Afrofusion: an Afrobeats base with aesthetic influences from the rest of the world.\n\nThat African base was ever present \u2013 in the Yoruba-Pidgin lyrics, in the use of the talking drum and shekere instruments, in the infectious familial informality \u2014 but fused with global elements ranging from Kingston Town rhythms to Ed Sheeran aesthetics straight from the badlands of Ipswich: a sound as global as it is grounded. Burna Boy in full flight at Qudos Bank Arena. Credit: Glenn Pokorny Burna\u2019s studio production is glossy and complicated, which in the hands of a lesser artist might have been a disappointment live. Not so for the African Giant: in his case, less polish and more talent actually improved on his overstuffed recordings. His baritone especially benefited from the concert treatment \u2013 with AutoTune dialled back, we were reminded of the charm and intensity that sets his act apart from his peers. In fact, the a cappella intro to It\u2019s Plenty drops the vocal filters altogether and he sounds properly masterful as a result. The price for this willingness to experiment and mix things up was the occasional misfire. Bank on It was transformed with a smooth-jazz vibe, complete with a sax line straight from the Kenny G songbook: more lounge than Lagos; the CGI screen backdrops were more artificial than intelligent, and the occasional keytar on stage, like an escapee from a wedding band, only highlighted the strange aesthetic choices. Not that anyone seemed to mind, judging by the assortment of audience underwear thrown on stage. Shirtless from the second song, Burna Boy worked that rich voice and charisma hard, building to a closing climax of Ye and Last Last. And yet, for all the heat and magnetism, there was something missing \u2013 a looseness and unrestraint that would have transformed this good night into a great one: the gap between smouldering and fire.\n\nMUSIC\n\nGORDI\n\nPlayhouse, Sydney Opera House, October 17\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Though neither of them occurred during the performance, two medical episodes punctuated this show and told us something about Sophie Payten in both normal and Gordi mode, in medical and musical personas. The lesser of them, told in comic semi-pantomime, concerned Payten at the dentist when one of her songs, Heaven I Know, came on the surgery\u2019s playlist like the universe was helping convince them she really was a musician. On stage, that song built from looped and live vocal layers and slowly accreting instruments until we had an alterna-choir that served as a kind of halo around the simple lines of an ending and acceptance. \u201cYeah, I got older, and we got tired/Heaven I know, that we tried.\u201d Gordi aka Sophie Payten performs at the Sydney Opera House. Credit: Gabrielle Clement More seriously, the other story featured a patient of hers \u2013 Payten completed her medical studies during and immediately after COVID lockdowns \u2013 who confronted news of his imminent death with a level of equanimity that would be beyond most of us, leaving an impact on his young doctor.\n\nThe two songs inspired by this experience were not leaden but rather a flow of warm energy that pushed everything forward and a blend of Elliott Smith and Bon Iver as pure pop immersed in hazy winter. Around these three songs, in material that included all the tracks of her new-ish album, Like Plasticine, and scattered shots from previous releases, Payten/Gordi moved between endings and rebuilding, back and forth from thickened layers to modestly proportioned instrumentation, counter-intuitively guitar-pushed vibrant when crushed and synth-filled solemn when emotionally buoyant, and often distorting her voice through various effects as if not wanting clarity to be confused with truth. Songs found her uncertain on questing love (\u201cDo you care? Do you care?/Don\u2019t make me your peripheral lover\u201d), falling on a failure (\u201cI made available a portion of my heart/Not anymore\u201d) and rising again on the certainty of comfort (\u201cI know the pressure you feel seems relentless/But everything is fleeting, except you and I\u201d). And then, closing with Can We Work It Out, on the horns of a dilemma \u2013 ready to believe, but bracing for regret \u2013 she threw at us the bushiest and brightest song of the night with its solid propulsion and almost fizzing slices of vocals. THEATRE\n\nDAYTIME DEEWANE\n\nRiverside, October 18, until October 25\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 1980s Britain, after racist club bouncers wouldn\u2019t give anyone with brown skin their share of night, a new underground subculture emerged. These were the Daytimers, day parties run by South Asian collectives, where shunned ravers could congregate on their own terms, to their own DJs, dancing to new music blending bass-kicked Bhangra, Asian garage and diaspora-mixed jungle. Azan Ahmed sets his award-winning 2022 play at the last Daytimer party, in London in 1997. Sixteen-year-old Farhan (Ariyan Sharma), wonders whether Islam forbids dancing as he scurries nervously in school uniform towards his first-ever rave. His 20-year-old rude-boy cousin Sadiq (Ashan Kumar), bounces about impatiently in wifebeater vest and chains, breaking into rhapsodies on the dancefloor\u2019s true radical principles of defiance, humanism and transcendent release. Ariyan Sharma and Ashan Kumar are excellent as two cousins on clashing coming-of-age trajectories in Daytime Deewane. Credit: Phil Erbacher Built on the twists in its character foils, Daytime Deewane unfolds as a story about these two very different young Muslim men, each trying to define his means and methods of self-respect against the values and expectations of his heritage. It loses its beat in the last stretch \u2013 the time leap to a reunion scene strikes an off-key chord and leaves us with an ambiguous moral takeaway \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot to rate highly in this play about migration, masculinity and faith. Its two leads go point-for-point in endowing Riverside\u2019s Australian premiere with humour and depth. Sharma gives us signature goof as the duty-bound teenage square, cutting Farhan the weirdest of shapes as an aspirational \u201cpeacock\u201d bro while asking where the prayer room\u2019s at.",

        "text": "Australia is particularly reliant on AWS. The federal government inked a three-year whole-of-government deal in January 2025, giving federal, state and local agencies streamlined access to AWS services. The government has committed $2 billion over the next decade for AWS to build a \u201cTop Secret Cloud\u201d to host the nation\u2019s most sensitive defence and intelligence data. Anthony Albanese at a press conference during the prime minister\u2019s June visit to the Amazon Spheres in Seattle. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen More than 140 Commonwealth, state and territory agencies already rely on AWS for critical services in transport, health, education and tax collection. The root cause of this week\u2019s issue hasn\u2019t yet been identified, though it appears tied to a DNS (Domain Name System) failure within AWS\u2019s US-EAST-1 region, in Virginia. To put it simply, the digital phone book for much of the cloud was broken, and when AWS stumbles, anything or anyone relying on its services stumbles too.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new story. AWS experienced similar outages in 2023 and 2021, when a five-hour disruption prevented customers from accessing airline reservations and payment apps. And just 15 months ago, the CrowdStrike disaster showed us what happens when critical infrastructure software fails at scale. Loading The July 2024 CrowdStrike incident was different in nature, but similar in its sheer impact. CrowdStrike makes cybersecurity software that runs on individual computers and servers to protect them from hackers. A faulty update caused roughly 8.5 million Windows systems to crash simultaneously, triggering an estimated $US10 billion ($15.3 billion) in global damage. Airlines grounded thousands of flights. Hospitals scrambled to access patient records. Supermarkets effectively shut down and emergency services went dark. The two incidents share a troubling pattern: single points of failure causing cascading global chaos.\n\nBut there\u2019s a crucial difference. CrowdStrike affected individual machines that required technicians to manually fix them one by one. Monday\u2019s AWS outage hit centralised infrastructure \u2013 the very foundation upon which modern digital services are built. Checkouts at Coles in New Farm were offline after the CrowdStrike outage of July 19, 2024. Credit: Cameron Atfield The outage underscores the critical role AWS plays in the functioning of the entire internet. And for one provider to have so much influence is a problem when something goes wrong, far beyond just inconveniences for businesses or customers. \u201cWhen a single provider goes dark, critical services go offline with it,\u201d advocacy organisation Article 19 warns. \u201cMedia outlets become inaccessible, secure communication apps stop functioning, and the infrastructure that serves our digital society crumbles.\u201d They have a point. This isn\u2019t just about missing a few hours on social media or not being able to respond to your Tinder match. It\u2019s about systemic fragility in critical infrastructure that increasingly underpins finance, healthcare and ultimately democracy.\n\nTo be fair, cloud computing has brought real benefits, and has been one of the most transformative technologies over the last decade, alongside AI. It\u2019s made technology cheaper and more accessible, allowing start-ups to compete without buying expensive servers. It\u2019s enabled services to scale rapidly to meet demand. And companies like AWS do invest heavily in redundancy \u2013 back-up systems designed to kick in when something fails. They just don\u2019t always work. So, what should we do differently? First, regulators and governments must treat cloud infrastructure like the critical public utility it has become. The internet is too important not to. We don\u2019t allow one company to control 30 per cent of electricity generation for good reason and the same logic should apply to the digital infrastructure that powers modern life. This doesn\u2019t mean breaking up tech companies, necessarily, but it does mean greater oversight, standards and accountability.\n\nSecond, governments need to mandate genuine redundancy. And not just within a single provider\u2019s ecosystem, but across different providers. If your back-up generator runs on the same power grid as your main system, it\u2019s not really a back-up. Loading Third, we need transparency. When AWS goes down, the public deserves to know immediately what failed, why, what\u2019s at risk, and when full service will return. AWS did provide regular updates overnight, but the current system is inadequate for infrastructure this critical. None of this is straightforward or easy, but the status quo isn\u2019t working either. The internet has become too important to be this fragile, and too important to be held hostage by any single company.",

(Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n* \"The Australian ambassador? I don't know anything about him.\" - Mr Trump\n\n* \"Before I took this position, Mr President.\" - Australian ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd, when asked if he made negative comments about Mr Trump\n\n* \"I don't like you either.
