        "text": "Laws being tabled in Parliament today that force employers to pay super at the same time as wages could save Aussie workers up to $5.7 billion in unpaid super.\n\nCurrent legislation only requires super to be paid to employees every quarter, which lobbying groups argue cost Aussies $110 million a week and leaves some people $30,000 worse off upon retirement.\n\nShould the laws pass, they will come into effect on July 1 next year, and supporters of the laws say it will allow Aussies to better track their super, and decrease the chances of it being lost due to the actions and fates of businesses.\n\nAussies could be missing out on millions a week in unpaid super. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"It's really difficult for employees to keep track of whether their employers are up to date with super payments when they're only paid quarterly, especially if their pay varies each week,\" Mary Delahunty from ASFA, a superannuation body, said.\n\n\"It means going through months of payslips, adding up the super payments, and cross checking them against their super accounts.\n\n\"Often, by the time an employee discovers they've been underpaid, the employer is insolvent, or unreachable, making it impossible to recover what they're owed.\"\n\nUnpaid super could then unfairly impact certain groups of the working population, including women and younger workers.\n\nSuper Members Council CEO Misha Schubert said the reforms are simple and will benefit millions of Aussies who need it most.\n\n\"Payday super is a simple, fair and urgent reform to help ensure every dollar owed to workers makes it into their super account on time and in full,\" she said. \"Millions of Australians cannot afford to wait.\"\n\n\"Payday super is also tipped to deliver an average of an extra $7700 for working Australians by retirement because being paid your super sooner helps to grow your retirement savings faster.\"",

(Al Nassr FC via Getty Images)\n\nAnd in June 2025, the 40-year-old signed a new two-year deal with the Saudi outfit, reportedly worth more than US$400 million ($607.1 million) in tax free earnings.\n\nThat contract has boosted Ronaldo's net worth up to US$1.4 billion ($2.12 billion), according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe Portuguese superstar's earnings aren't the only stream of income that have skyrocketed his net worth.\n\nRonaldo has spoken of club ownership. (Getty)\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a decade-long Nike deal worth almost US$18 million ($27.3 million) a year, as well as sponsorships with brands such as Armani and Castrol \u2013 adding over US$175 million ($265.6 million) to his net worth, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRonaldo has also amassed a global real estate portfolio and invested in a number of businesses in multiple countries, including Portugal and Spain.\n\nThe five-time Champions League winner now joins the likes of basketball legend Michael Jordan and retired tennis superstar Roger Federer on the sought-after list of billionaire athletes.\n\nLegendary basketballer Michael Jordan is one of sport's few billionaires.

        "text": "Dolly Parton wants everyone know she's fine and \"not dying.\"\n\nAn odd thing to have to say, yes. But the country music icon, actress, activist and humanitarian posted a video to social media on Wednesday to clear up rumours that had been going around to the contrary.\n\n\"I wanted to say, I know lately everybody thinks that I'm sicker than I am,\" Parton, 79, said in the video from a set where she was filming a commercial for the Grand Ole Opry. \"Do I look sick to you? I'm workin' hard here.\"\n\nDolly Parton shares new video on social media with health update after concern over her condition (Instagram/Dolly Parton)\n\nDressed in a red and black fringe top, the \"9 to 5\" star added that she \"wanted to put everybody's mind at ease\" because many seemed \"real concerned, which I appreciate.\"\n\n\"And I appreciate your prayers because I'm a person of faith. I can always use the prayers for anything and everything, but I want you to know that I'm ok,\" she added in the video, which was captioned \"I ain't dead yet!\"\n\nParton went on to acknowledge that she's had \"some problems\" health-wise, which she had mentioned last month when she cancelled a series of December concerts in Las Vegas. She then elaborated on the reasons behind those issues.\n\n\"Back when my husband Carl was very sick \u2013 that was for a long time \u2013 and then when he passed, I didn't take care of myself,\" she said. \"So I let a lot of things go that I should have been taking care of. So, anyway, when I got around to it, the doctor said 'We need to take care of this, we need to take care of that.' Nothing major, but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home.\"\n\nParton's husband of nearly 60 years Carl Dean died in March.\n\nHeightened concerns about Parton's health were spurred on Tuesday, when her sister Freida posted to Facebook that she'd been \"up all night praying\" for the \"Jolene\" singer.\n\nDolly Parton is seen on Dolly Parton's Pet Gala in Nashville, on January 30. (Jon Morgan/CBS/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\n\"Many of you know she hasn't been feeling her best lately. I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me,\" Freida Parton's post read. \"She's strong, she's loved, and with all the prayers being lifted for her, I know in my heart she's going to be just fine. Godspeed, my sissy Dolly. We all love you!\"\n\nMass panic ensued, reasonably.\n\nBut someone apparently had words with Freida, because she went back on Facebook later to tell everyone that she didn't intend for her words to spark worry. \"I didn't mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly,\" she wrote. \"It was nothing more than a little sister asking for prayers for her big sister.\"\n\nLater, another Parton sister appeared. This one was named Stella. \"My sister Freida is always concerned when one of her siblings isn't feeling well so she ask for prayers on Dolly's behalf,\" she explained. She then went on to say she was mad about being asked for health updates on her sister.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Cargo door on Jetstar flight wide open as plane readies for takeoff\n\nDolly Parton's statement cancelling recent shows also sparked concerns. (Instagram/@dollyparton)\n\nFans were on particularly high alert because this call for prayers came soon after the death of Parton's husband. The death of a long-term spouse has been associated with illness and even death in the surviving partner.\n\nLate last month, Parton announced that she was postponing her December concerts in Las Vegas due to some \"health challenges.\"\n\nShe added that she had been told by doctors she had to undergo \"a few procedures,\" without elaborating further.\n\n\"Given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see,\" she wrote at the time.\n\nREAD MORE: Man charged after fatal shooting while hunting on NSW property\n\nDolly Parton performs during the college football game between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Tennessee Volunteers on November 18, 2023. (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nParton was set to perform six shows at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in December in her first Las Vegas residency in more than 30 years. Those concerts were rescheduled for September 2026.\n\nParton is one of the most-beloved musicians \u2013 likely even one of the most-beloved people \u2013 in the world.\n\nShe is a long-time best-selling songwriter and performer and actor. Her charitable works include helping underwrite Moderna's vaccine for COVID-19. Her program that sends books to children has changed an untold number of lives; the Louisville chapter alone noted recently that it had just mailed its 500,000th book to a child.\n\nIn her video on Wednesday, Parton said she hoped that if her admirers \"heard it from me, you'd know that I was ok.\"\n\n\"I'm not ready to die yet. I don't think God is through with me and I ain't done workin',\" she added. \"So I love you for caring and keep praying for me.\"",

        "text": "Tasmania's parliamentarians have received a draft version of the order they will vote on to determine the fate of the Macquarie Point Stadium project.\n\nThe order lays out the conditions that the project must adhere to if it is greenlit to proceed by the parliament.\n\nMost parliamentarians already know which way they will vote but some have been waiting to see the order.\n\nThe draft order cannot be amended by the parliament but the Liberal government can make tweaks before it is formally tabled.\n\nThe ABC has obtained a copy of the draft order.\n\nWhat is in the order?\n\nThe order is broken down into seven parts, including Aboriginal heritage conditions, historic cultural heritage conditions, environmental conditions, TasWater conditions and council conditions.\n\nHobart's Macquarie stadium plan draws the 'experts' Photo shows Outline of stadium in Hobart seen from across the Derwent. Tasmania's minister responsible for the proposed $1.13 billion Macquarie Point stadium, Eric Abetz, says there are many \"expert\" views, but ultimately the government will decide.\n\nThere is also a section dedicated to the enforcement of those conditions and which agency is responsible for doing so.\n\nThe order is largely based on the draft permit conditions submitted by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation to the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) in July during hearings into the project.\n\nThe order proposes the establishment of a design quality and integrity review panel that would consist of at least three members who would scrutinise the architecture, urban design and historic cultural heritage elements of the stadium.\n\nThe order proposes the creation of a panel to scrutinise the architecture and urban design of the stadium. (Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Corporation)\n\nIt also outlines the need for an operational management plan to be put in place at least 18 months before the stadium starts operating.\n\nThis requires an events management plan, which involves traffic changes, how buses will operate, and pedestrian access, along with security management, emergency evacuation planning and flood planning.\n\nThese matters can be addressed after the stadium is approved.\n\nWhat happened to the legislation?\n\nBefore the snap state election the government introduced direct legislation for the stadium, but there was not time for it to pass.\n\nThe TPC released its final report advising that the plan be abandoned, but the government is continuing with the Project of State Significance process, which has resulted in this \"order\".\n\nThe legislation would have given Eric Abetz the power to amend the stadium permit. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nThe enabling legislation would have given power to the minister \u2013 in that case, Eric Abetz \u2013 to amend the stadium permit, as long as he consults with the premier, local council and regulators.\n\nHe would also have been able to direct the TPC to change planning schemes to match the stadium and to subdivide land and make changes to property arrangements \"in the interests of efficiency\".\n\nStadium report responds to TPC criticisms Photo shows A concept image of the proposed Hobart stadium at Macquarie Poi nt. The state government response to last month's scathing report from the planning commission says that while \"change can be challenging\", the \"dream of a Tasmanian team representing our state in the AFL and AFLW is now within reach \u2013 we cannot turn back\".\n\nThe order appears to lack these specific ministerial powers, but states that the director of the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) can sign off on certain changes.\n\nThe intent of the previous legislation and current order is the same \u2014 to get a stadium approved. The choice of mechanism is more a matter of timing than anything else.\n\nNeither process was intended to allow appeals.\n\nThe TPC provided some comment on the government's proposed conditions, which are broadly similar to the draft order and are included as an appendix at the end of the full report.\n\n\"The panel does not consider that the proposed conditions address the full project scope and impact of the project, and considers that they do not mitigate significant negative effects, or give effect to all relevant planning considerations,\" the report said.\n\nLoading...\n\nHas it changed since the TPC report?\n\nThere has been a few updates.\n\nA landscaping plan must consider ways to minimise wind impacts on patrons.\n\nThe lighting curfew could be extended for specific events with the government's approval.\n\nA special events management plan could be established for events of up to 38,000 patrons.\n\nThere's also a requirement to manage coordination with events at the cenotaph.\n\nRide share services, such as Uber, might also be geoblocked near the stadium before and after events.\n\nThe draft order suggests rideshare services may be geoblocked near the stadium before and after events. (ABC News)\n\nCan the order be changed?\n\nNormal legislation is able to be amended as it makes its way through parliament, but the final order will be a \"yes or no\" proposition.\n\nBut the government has provided MPs with a draft order to enable some level of feedback and the potential for changes to be made before it comes to parliament.\n\nThis allows the government to choose whose feedback it might take on board and some votes will be more important to them than others.\n\nThe draft order will become a final order on October 22.\n\nThe governor then needs to approve it and the government intends to have it debated in the lower house on November 13.\n\nThe future of the project will be decided by a handful of independents. (ABC News: Sophie Jaggers)\n\nWhen will the votes be cast?\n\nLabor continues to support the stadium and the order will pass the lower house.\n\nWho are the MLCs deciding the Hobart stadium's fate? Photo shows Six boxes showing names and photos of Tasmanian MLCs. The future of Tasmania's proposed Macquarie Point AFL stadium rests in the hands of the state's politicians. So who will vote which way, and what is the chance it will actually get up?\n\nThe crucial vote is in the upper house, where debate is set to take place on December 3 and 4.\n\nWith Labor's support the government needs the votes of three out of eight independents.\n\nIt could come down to independents Tania Rattray, Casey Hiscutt, Bec Thomas and Dean Harriss.\n\nPremier Jeremy Rockliff intends to have the stadium approved by the end of the year.\n\nIt must start operating by the start of the men's AFL season in 2029 or government will face financial penalties from the AFL.",

(ABC News: West Matteeussen)\n\nDr Simon Slota-Kan, a physician with the Pilbara Public Health Unit, described the spread as \"unfortunate\".\n\n\"These cases have not all been linked together very closely, like we usually like them to be, and we're concerned that there's now community spread,\" he said.\n\n\"Community spread means that this has been occurring and cases have been happening, but we haven't been able to say exactly [how] this person is linked to that particular person.\"\n\nPrevious cases have been traced to the Pilbara's largely fly-in, fly-out mining workforce, returning from destinations like Bali.\n\nDr Slota-Kan said the highly infectious nature of the virus made it especially challenging to track.\n\n\"It's very easy for people to spread it without themselves knowing and people coming in contact without them knowing,\" he said.\n\nSeveral cases of measles with no known source have been confirmed in the Pilbara. (Supplied: WA Health)\n\nWA Health has pledged additional staff and vaccine doses to combat the highly infectious virus in the Pilbara.\n\nDr Slota-Kan called on residents to monitor themselves for symptoms as schools look to return from holidays next week.\n\n\"That would be good preparation to check your vaccination status and make sure that you're vigilant for any cases, to protect the schools as kids come back,\" he said.\n\nTesting sites are available at the Hedland Health Campus, Karratha Health Campus, Roebourne Hospital, Onslow Health Service, and Newman Health Service.\n\n'Below the safe threshold'\n\nWhat is the measles? Photo shows A boy with a third day measles rash. Australia was declared measles-free in 2014, but imported cases are still sometimes diagnosed. So, what does it do to your body, and what sort of threat can it pose to the population?\n\nWA Health said the unknown cases had likely been introduced from travellers returning from overseas.\n\nMeasles was officially eliminated from Australia in 2014, but has resurged worldwide due to falling immunisation rates and pandemic-related disruptions.\n\n\"It really can only take one traveller to start an outbreak like we've seen in WA,\" said Milena Dalton, an immunologist at the Burnet Institute.\n\nShe urged anyone born during or after 1966 to ensure they have two documented doses of the measles vaccine.\n\nChanges to vaccination standards in the 1990s mean many adults only have one dose.\n\n\"Australia has now fallen below the safe threshold, so we've dropped below the 95 [per cent] herd immunity level needed to stop outbreaks,\" Dr Dalton said.\n\n\"This gap is leaving thousands of people, especially babies, pregnant women and immunocompromised Australians, at risk.\"",

But these are economic agreements to give the league more visibility, things that are beyond us. There's a lot of talk about schedules and player health, and this all seems truly absurd.\n\n\"It's crazy to travel so many miles for a match between two Italian teams in Australia. We have to adapt, as always.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old's outspoken criticism didn't go down well with Serie A chief executive Luigi De Siervo.\n\n\"Rabiot is right, we decide for him,\" De Siervo told Italian media.\n\nSerie A game in Perth would have been laughable 10 years ago Photo shows AC Milan's Ricardo Kaka celebrates after scoring, looking up and pointing to the skies, in the rain Italian heavyweights AC Milan look set to play a match, for actual Serie A points, in Perth.

Daria Kasatkina ends her 2025 WTA season early, citing the hectic schedule and a high-stress year after switching nationalities to Australia from Russia.\n\nThe landmark never looked in doubt once de Minaur had earned the only break of the opening set to go ahead 6-5, starting a run of six straight games as he assumed total control in the second, eventually hitting 19 winners and making just 10 unforced errors over the course of an hour and 48 minutes.\n\nIt set up a last-eight date with 16th seed Daniil Medvedev, who outlasted Learner Tien 7-6(8/6), 6-7(1/7), 6-4.\n\nDe Minaur's season, with 50 wins and 18 losses, tops his previous best of 47-21 last year.\n\nBut he did earn two titles in 2024 and is aiming to match that by landing his second of 2025, following his triumph in Washington in August, with the draw looking a little more open after shock third-round losses for Jannik Sinner and Alex Zverev, and the absence of Carlos Alcaraz.\n\n\"For me, it just shows consistency and that is what I am most proud of,\" de Minaur said of his half-century.\n\n\"Showing up every single week, and it is an amazing number.\n\n\"I am hoping for many more to finish off the year and not stay at 50. It has been a successful trip to Asia so far.\"\n\nThe brutally hot and humid conditions in Shanghai have taken their toll, with Sinner retiring against Tallon Griekspoor with cramp while Novak Djokovic was sick on court during his win over Yannick Hanfmann.\n\n\"I told myself at the start of the week it was all going to be a big mental effort to go out there and compete,\" de Minaur said.\n\n\"I am happy to be in the quarterfinals and give myself another opportunity.\"\n\nMedvedev struggled with cramp in his win. He kept telling his watching team, \"I'm done\", and looked at one point as if he was about to quit before he eventually prevailed after nearly 3 hours against US teen Tien, who beat him in another gruelling affair at the Australian Open in January.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nDe Minaur will be facing his old Russian foe for the 12th time on Friday, with 29-year-old Medvedev leading their head-to-head 7-4 but \"Demon\" winning their only 2025 clash, in Monte Carlo, and four of their last seven.\n\nThe winner would then have a semifinal against the victor between 12th seed Fe\u0301lix Auger-Aliassime and Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech.\n\nCanadian Auger-Aliassime outplayed Italy's Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2, while Rinderknech accounted for Czech Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka 6-3, 7-6(7/5).\n\nMusetti's defeat is further good news for de Minaur as he eliminated the Australian in his only Masters semi this season, at Monte-Carlo, and they are direct rivals to grab a place in the eight-man ATP Finals in Turin.\n\nThe Italian is on 3,435 points in eighth place, 110 behind de Minaur in seventh. Auger-Aliassime has moved on to 2,905 points in 10th, with Briton Jack Draper, in ninth, already out for the season with injury.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "By the time Optus had contacted the communications authority and the minister\u2019s office, hundreds of users had been unable to contact emergency services; the South Australian Police, Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, and customers had contacted the telco to let them know something was wrong. Three people died while unable to contact Triple Zero during the outage. Loading How could a telecommunications company mess up an email address? Both emails sent from Optus to ACMA on the afternoon of September 18 were sent to incorrect addresses, despite the carrier telling the authority they had the correct email address six days earlier. On September 11, a week before the network outage, Optus was informed by ACMA that the email address the telco should contact to raise an alert about network issues had changed. On the same day, the authority updated its website to reflect that change. The following day, Optus updated its internal IT systems to reflect the change, confirming this with the watchdog.\n\nBetween September 11 and October 8, Optus sent 272 emails to the correct address \u2013 around 10 emails per day. However, on the day of the catastrophic outage, September 18, Optus sent two emails to the old address that was no longer monitored regularly. Based on testimony from the Department of Communications at Senate estimates on Wednesday, these were the only emails within that period to be sent to the incorrect address. Why did Optus only raise the alarm after the outage was over? The first contact from Optus to raise alarms about the outage came 14 hours after the crisis had started, and almost an hour after upgrade works were paused and the system began to be restored. Optus CEO Stephen Rue himself said that he was aware of the severity of the crisis at 1.30pm on September 18, but the watchdog was not notified for a further 70 minutes. Telcos are obliged to notify Telstra, which operates Triple Zero call centres, and ACMA \u201cas soon as possible\u201d after a significant network outage. Was email forwarding too difficult for the Department of Communications?\n\nThe new email for emergency notification was established by the Department of Communications just a week before Optus\u2019 network outage, yet the department had not established any forwarding system so that messages sent to the defunct account would still be seen. Representatives for the department repeatedly said at Senate estimates this week that the fault clearly lay with Optus for sending alerts to the wrong email. However, in their own testimony, they said they had told telco companies that the defunct email would be monitored occasionally. While the emails were sent after the crisis was rectified, and their arrival at a correct address would have done little to solve the problem, it is unclear why a basic mail-forwarding system was not in operation. Why did Optus stay silent about the deaths for almost 24 hours? Optus chief executive Stephen Rue informed the minister, the industry watchdog and the public that there were deaths during the network outage on the afternoon of September 19. However, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young told Senate estimates on Wednesday that when she met with Rue on Tuesday he told her the telco was aware of deaths on the evening of September 18, and he personally became aware of them at 9am on September 19.\n\nOptus chief Stephen Rue attempts to leave Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday, but falls foul of the security gates. Credit: Nine News While the exact time Optus employees became aware of the deaths on September 18 is unknown, there is a significant delay in informing the public, the minister, the department, or the watchdog. Is anyone with teeth investigating? Optus\u2019s board has appointed Kerry Schott, the former CEO of Sydney Water, to lead an independent review into the September 18 outage. The company has also employed American firm Kearney to oversee its Triple Zero operations and its network more broadly on an ongoing basis. A second review from ACMA will investigate the outage, and both will report publicly. However, both the opposition and the Greens have criticised the measures, saying Optus and the watchdog cannot be trusted to oversee the reviews. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson went so far as to describe ACMA\u2019s review as \u201clike putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank\u201d.\n\nThe Coalition unsuccessfully moved on Wednesday to establish a House select committee to investigate the outage, which the government voted down. However, Hanson-Young said she is determined to establish a \u201cfull-blown parliamentary inquiry\u201d once the Senate next sits at the end of the month. A vote from the Coalition, Greens and crossbenchers could easily see the inquiry established, and if this week\u2019s senate estimates are any sign of what\u2019s to come, it would not be an easy ride for Optus. Did Communications Minister Anika Wells fail? The opposition has run a concerted campaign this week to lay blame over the crisis at Wells\u2019 feet. Some of their accusations, including the claim that Optus\u2019 emails were \u201csecret\u201d don\u2019t hold much water after Wells office repeatedly pointed to her addressing them on September 22. However, Wells and the former minister Michelle Rowland sat on key recommendations from the Bean review into Optus\u2019 previous major outage in 2023 for 17 months, only completing two-thirds of them by September 18.\n\nIt was not until the September 18 outage that Wells said the government was fast-tracking legislation to empower a Triple Zero custodian to oversee the emergency services call ecosystem, despite the recommendation being accepted some 16 months prior. The custodian group already exists within the Department of Communications, but was toothless without the legislation. Loading Another issue was the fact that Wells travelled to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City just days after the outage. She defended her actions, saying she was advocating to world leaders about the government\u2019s under-16 social media ban, describing the proposition as having the capacity to \u201cchange the world\u201d. Finally, Wells described herself as \u201cstill a new minister\u201d to the portfolio as she worked through the issue. Coming almost five months after her appointment to the role, the opposition has made political hay of the comment. Why hasn\u2019t the Optus CEO resigned yet?",

The evening was promoted as one of \u201cRoman inspired\u201d food and fine wines under Grossi\u2019s \u201cwatchful eye\u201d that was \u201csure to be a sell-out\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the meals were served, Pegrum said she introduced herself to Grossi as a journalist and asked to take his photograph for her work\u2019s social media page. \u201cHe was clearly very drunk by this point,\u201d Pegrum said. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not having a photo unless you\u2019re in it\u2019.\u201d Pegrum said she repeatedly declined, but was ignored. Loading \u201cHe grabbed me in a forced hug, picked me up off the ground, started spinning me around,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember feeling totally humiliated.\u201d This masthead corroborated Pegrum\u2019s account with two sources who were told about the incident. Grossi denied the claims through lawyers. \u201cThe behaviour you have described is not only unsubstantiated but is calculated to cause harm to Mr Grossi\u2019s impeccable and well-deserved reputation as an icon of the Australian food and dining industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, Grossi confirmed plans to sell his famous Grossi Florentino restaurant, and a string of other venues on Bourke Street, that have been managed by his family for 26 years. This masthead reported earlier this week the Bourke Street restaurants will be sold to the hospitality group run by Rebecca Yazbek, who owns Nomad restaurant and Reine & La Rue in Melbourne and other venues in Sydney.\n\nThe news has reverberated around Melbourne\u2019s hospitality industry \u2013 a significant change of hands for an institution central to the city\u2019s history and identity since the doors opened in 1928. Pegrum said amid the fanfare, the industry needed to tackle important conversations about the next generation of hospitality leaders. \u201cHow do we create an industry that is not celebrating people over and over who are exploiting people? What are we missing? Who are we not championing?\u201d Family business Grossi\u2019s parents migrated to Australia from Italy in 1960, after an invitation from Mario Vigano, the owner of Australia\u2019s earliest Italian restaurant, Mario\u2019s, to work in his kitchen as a chef.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe restaurant was then located on Exhibition Street, where guests dined on authentic Italian food for the first time to live music played by men wearing bowties and sparkling jackets. Grossi didn\u2019t always want to follow his father\u2019s footsteps as a chef, and told journalists over the years of how he resented his childhood spent helping his father in the kitchen peeling potatoes and scrubbing floors. But something changed and Grossi trained under notable chef Hermann Schneider, who he described in food podcast The Luminaries as a \u201chard taskmaster\u201d who gave him a \u201clevel of discipline I never experienced before\u201d. Grossi was 25 years old when he opened his first restaurant Quadri with his wife Melissa, serving Italian food to a suburban crowd. He excelled quickly, opening restaurants around Melbourne with his father and sister \u2013 Tolarno, Cafe Grossi, Massoni, Two Faces, the list goes on.

Credit: Luis Ascui His greatest achievement was signing the lease to Florentino in 1999 - regarded as the city\u2019s oldest restaurant - that was long admired by his father. The heritage-listed, white-tablecloth venue hosted everyone from prime ministers to gangland figures. Mick Gatto\u2019s book launch was held there in 2009. Food commentator Cam Smith said Grossi Florentino had been in the family\u2019s blood for a \u201cvery, very long time\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat restaurant in a way is a little bit like the Patek Philippe watch \u2013 you don\u2019t own it, you look after it for the next generation.\u201d Running the venue alongside his sister and son, Grossi treated customers like family too, hosting Christmas lunches at Florentino each year \u2013 serving festive menus on long tables of bon bons.

Credit: Mark Chew Under his stewardship, Grossi retained the restaurant\u2019s multiple hats for most of its life, invested in a massive new oven and opened more diverse dining options downstairs, including Grossi Grill, Cellar Bar and Arlechin bar. He grew a celebrity profile, authoring award-winning cookbooks, appearing on MasterChef and headlining major events like the Australian Open. However, beneath the glossy magazine features and rolling public praise was another story. This masthead published an investigation earlier this year revealing allegations of Grossi\u2019s inappropriate behaviour towards female staff stretching back more than a decade. Grossi emerged as a divisive culinary leader during interviews with dozens of current and former staff. Some said he was a great mentor, while others said he sexualised young waitresses he employed, commenting on their appearances and touching their bodies without consent. Others described a sexist culture where complaints about staff harassment were brushed aside. Grossi issued a public apology to one senior industry leader who accused him of groping her breast at an industry event in 2022, but denied all wrongdoing and defended his conduct and his restaurants\u2019 workplace culture.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size A funny thing happened on the way to Australia, 50 years ago, before cricket\u2019s calendar was drafted by the dollar. Clive Lloyd\u2019s West Indies stopped off in Papua New Guinea and played two games against the local national team, on canvas pitches stretched over concrete. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it was,\u201d Lloyd, now 81, says from his London home. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s all those years ago, I still remember it like yesterday. Wonderful country, wonderful people. They made us feel thoroughly at home.\u201d The timing was exquisite. Four months earlier, Lloyd\u2019s team had defeated Australia at Lord\u2019s to win cricket\u2019s inaugural World Cup. The imminent 1975-76 summer \u2013 a world Test championship before it had a name \u2013 \u201cdidn\u2019t end up too well, cricket-wise,\u201d Lloyd reflects. \u201cBut it was a learning curve.\u201d Indeed. Other than a 1-0 glitch in India when weakened by Kerry Packer\u2019s breakaway World Series, the rampant West Indies didn\u2019t lose another Test series until 1995. For cricket fans in PNG (there were and still are many), the October stopover crowned a party that began on September 16, when independence was achieved after decades of being governed as a territory of Australia. The significance was not lost on Lloyd, whose native Guyana experienced a similar cutting of the apron strings from Great Britain in 1966, the year he played the first of his 110 Tests. \u201cYou could see the Australians and the locals were very together \u2013 they were helping them in trying to move forward as a nation. We were the first people to celebrate with them. We found it a very special occasion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGames were played on consecutive days, in Lae and Port Moresby. Snippets of footage show the squad arriving at the airport, Lloyd interviewed on the tarmac by Richie Benaud (big-collared \u201970s shirt unbuttoned to the sternum). There is some action from the Lae game, and delightful footage of kids in the crowd, agog as the West Indians do some catching practice next to buai (betel nut) trees with Mt Herzog in the distance. Gordon Greenidge wears the same pale blue terry-towelling hat he\u2019d donned in the World Cup final. At a drinks break, he takes a glass from a tray, swigs something too sweet, and promptly spits it on the ground. Viv Richards, 23 and about to become the most destructive batsman in the game, hams it up for the camera as he accepts a gong for highest score. Broad smiles and hoots of laughter are constants.

A beaming local waiter displays platters of nibbles that would have done Don\u2019s Party proud. Kentish tells the gathering the West Indies have visited \u201cas a gesture to show ourselves as potential leaders in world cricket\u201d. Lloyd\u2019s most vivid memory is enjoying a \u201cmumu\u201d, a traditional meal of meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in coals in the earth. \u201cIt\u2019s something people used to do in the West Indies years ago. And the meat was so soft, it was wonderful.\u201d The Windies were welcomed by PNG fans. Credit: YouTube He remembers \u201csome very good cricketers\u201d playing for PNG, too. Among them in the Moresby game was Ilinome Tarua, who had much to celebrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing up on Kwato Island, at PNG\u2019s south-eastern tip, Tarua absorbed his fast-bowling father\u2019s love of cricket. \u201cWe had a radio. When overseas cricket was on, we put the radio on wherever we go. My father was a great supporter of the West Indies.\u201d In 1972, he was one of the first two law graduates from the University of Papua New Guinea, where he also captained the cricket team. The next year he had oversight to PNG\u2019s self-governance, and by the time the Windies came calling, he was Prime Minister Michael Somare\u2019s legal advisor. Now 83 and living in Sydney, he\u2019s excited to revisit everything about that time, not least the cricket. \u201cI still have a feeling about the wonderful experience I had playing against them, even though it was overwhelming.\u201d Five decades on, the sense of opportunity lost in his inning of nine runs remains. \u201cViv Richards was bowling and I misread him, I was really annoyed with myself,\u201d Tarua says. \u201cI was looking for the spin and it was a straight ball!\u201d Vic Richards in 1975. Credit: The Age High Commission postings took him to London and New Zealand; Tarua was also PNG\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Germany, Italy, Israel and Greece. He and wife Susan, who met at university, moved to Sydney in 1991 after his last diplomatic service role, as consul general. He played cricket throughout, captaining teams and making runs, including an unbeaten hundred. And after playing against the mighty West Indies, he bowled part-time spin \u2013 just like Viv. \u201cI tried to copy him!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaunao Vai observed a more high-octane impact on young locals who saw the West Indies win by 70 runs in the 25-over Lae game, and 86 runs in a 40-over contest the next day at Port Moresby\u2019s Sir Hubert Murray Stadium. \u201cThe young generation, the teenagers, they started to copy the fast bowlers,\u201d Vai says. \u201cThey thought, yeah, fast bowling was it! Everyone started taking the long run-ups.\u201d An opening batter who was studying economics at UPNG, Vai credits the dean of the law faculty \u2013 a well-connected West Indian named Professor James \u2013 with making the quirky micro-tour happen. Lloyd\u2019s recall runs no deeper than simple good manners \u2013 sensing an unforgettable independence celebration opportunity, Cricket PNG proffered an invitation, and the Windies said sure, why not? Mark Davis is originally from Melbourne, and was working as a journalist with the Post Courier. He met local woman Olive when he stopped in PNG at the start of a planned \u201cgrand tour\u201d of the world, and stayed put. He played cricket with Olive\u2019s brothers, and remembers the Port Moresby competition being strong, the Lae one competitive, and smaller comps in Rabaul, Hagen and Goroka. \u201cWhen I first went there in 1974 there were a lot of expats playing,\u201d Davis says. \u201cThe main Moresby competition was a pretty high standard \u2013 there were some damn good players who\u2019d played district cricket in Australia. In the next few years they became fundamentally PNG sides with locals playing. Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were thrashed in Australia that summer, but went on to dominate world cricket. Credit: YouTube \u201cAs independence moved along, a fair whack of the expatriate community left and the PNG community became more and more important in both cricket and footy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPNG became an associate member of the ICC in 1973, and has competed in the ICC Trophy since 1979. Vai played a dozen times for his country, including three tours to England. He remains a Cricket PNG board member, and is looking forward to the Barramundis tackling Samoa and Oman in October in pursuit of a third T20 World Cup appearance in 2026. The West Indies coming to town remains an untouchable memory. \u201cI faced the first ball of the match, bowled by Andy Roberts,\u201d Vai says. \u201cI can remember that very, very well. Quite hesitant, but I thought it was a very exciting occasion, so I took the punt. And it was a short one too!\u201d He made one before lunging forward to Bernard Julien and popping a catch to Greenidge in his blue hat. His opening partner, Nigel Agonia, played in both games, carrying his bat for an unbeaten 36 in Lae and backing up with 14. An average of 50 v the West Indies puts him in rare company. His all-round talents were such that commentator Jim Maxwell, when asked the scariest bowler he\u2019d seen, recalled that Agonia \u201cfrightened the hell out of everyone\u201d during his school days in Sydney.

Rinderknecht fled the scene after starting the fire, but returned to the same trail to watch it burn, acting US Attorney Bill Essayli said during a news conference. \u201cHe left as soon as he saw the fire trucks were headed to the location. He turned around and went back up there. And he took some video and watched them fight the fire,\u201d Essayli said. Uber said in a statement that it worked with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine the driver\u2019s whereabouts around the time of the fire.\n\nRinderknecht also made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint. During an interview on January 24, Rinderknecht told investigators where the fire began, information not yet public and that he would not have known if he hadn\u2019t witnessed it, according to the criminal complaint. A person walks on the beach next to homes destroyed by the Palisades fire. Credit: AP He lied about his location, claiming he was near the bottom of the hiking trail, Essayli said. The suspect was visibly anxious during that interview, according to the complaint. His efforts to call 911 and his question to ChatGPT about a cigarette lighting a fire indicated he \u201cwanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire, and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire\u201d, the complaint said.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, investigators found a ChatGPT prompt by Rinderknecht asking the chatbot to make a \u201cdystopian painting\u201d showing a crowd fleeing from a burning forest and poor people trying to get past a gate with a \u201cbig dollar sign on it\u201d. Loading \u201cOn the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people,\u201d the prompt allegedly read. \u201cThey are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle.\u201d Investigators determined the January 1 fire was intentionally lit, likely by a lighter taken to vegetation or paper, according to the criminal complaint. They excluded other possibilities, including fireworks, lightning and power lines. Authorities also looked into whether a cigarette may have caused the fire, but concluded that it was not the cause, the complaint says.\n\nInvestigators found a \u201cbarbecue-style\u201d lighter inside the glove box of Rinderknecht\u2019s car on January 24. It appeared to be the same lighter as the one that was in his apartment on December 31, based on a photo on his phone. He admitted to bringing a lighter with him when he walked up the hill. Federal prosecutors will need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Palisades Fire grew from that blaze that broke out six days earlier, said Jerod Gunsberg, a California criminal defence lawyer with experience in arson cases. Homes ablaze in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles on January 7., Credit: Philip Cheung/The New York Times But he said that was something defence lawyers are likely to question. \u201cThe defence is going to say, \u2018How do we know it was the same guy? There\u2019s a lot of time that went on in between these two fires\u2019,\u201d said Gunsberg, who is not involved in the Palisades case. \u201cSo the prosecutors will have to show that evidence.\u201d\n\nEven if firefighters thought the original fire was extinguished, he said, that does not absolve someone from being held accountable. \u201cYou\u2019re not off the hook,\u201d Gunsberg said. Loading Investigators still haven\u2019t determined the cause of a second blaze, the Eaton Fire, which broke out the same day in the community of Altadena and killed 19 people. Both fires reduced block after block of entire neighbourhoods to grey and black debris, destroying homes, schools, businesses and churches. While rebuilding is underway in some neighbourhoods, it will take years. Many home owners will not be able to afford it, even those with insurance. An outside review released in September found that a lack of resources and outdated policies for sending emergency alerts led to delayed evacuation warnings.",

        "text": "Parents, disability advocates, autistic adults and other stakeholders have told a parliamentary inquiry they fear vulnerable children won't be able to access the appropriate care under the government's new program for autistic children.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, Health Minister Mark Butler announced the creation of the Thriving Kids program, which will launch in July 2026 to and begin replacing NDIS support in mid-2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says it will provide support and intervention through mainstream channels, such as general practitioners and schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisability advocacy organisations from around Australia addressed the parliamentary committee established by the government to guide the implementation of the program, many of them voicing strong concerns about the proposed changes and workforce capability.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmissions described lengthy and invasive assessments to access support under current arrangements and fears the changes risk creating a \"two tier\" system, with children likely to \"fall through the cracks\".\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny Karavolos, who has an autistic child and is the chief executive of Disability Advocacy and Complaints Service South Australia, said she was worried children with mild to moderate needs would be overlooked in an already under-resourced system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The families and autistic individuals tell us they're exhausted from navigating fragmented systems,\" she told the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many just can't afford the basics, saving up reach just to see a GP or fill a script when they finally reach a door. Often it is the wrong door or the right door that people behind it simply do not understand about disability. So services exist in theory, but in practice, families face long wait lists, unaffordable gap fees, and supports that are not trauma informed or inclusive.\"\n\n\n\nCommittee chair and Labor MP Mike Freelander said he was aware of stakeholder concerns, adding the government wouldn't be able to design a \"perfect system\". Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Plans for the rollout have also worried some experts like Professor Sharon Lawn, the executive director of Lived Experience Australia and the former Mental Health Commissioner for South Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said children with learning difficulties or autism that are labelled as mild are actually the most in need of consistent, effective support because their challenges are too often dismissed or minimised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Basic stereotyping is the problem in a lot of service systems,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So with children who may be presenting, for example, with behavioural issues, particularly the mild group, particularly where a family may experience socioeconomic disadvantage, it's easier to jump to, oh, this is the cause of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then it can very quickly get into blame. It can become many other things other than what it actually is as a child that actually has a need for a Thriving Kids program.\"\n\n\n\nExcluding autism from the NDIS was \"ableist and discriminatory\", according to a submission from independent support co-ordinator and mother of two autistic sons Ange McArthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe warned a \"deeply harmful\" narrative around the changes had demonised autistic people as a \"burden\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganisations that represent rural and regional Australians with disability said they shared these concerns, and are also worried about accessibility and cultural safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nNiki Lehmann is the CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group Autism NT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you go to Alice Springs, you have to come bang on every three months,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can't just walk into any community and go, hey, we're here. You have to collaborate with other services, people that understand that community. So the remoteness is a huge part, especially trying to get to community, making community understand all our diagnosis.\"\n\n\n\nCommittee chair and Labor MP Mike Freelander said he was aware of those concerns, and that the committee recognised the timeline was a \"difficulty\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the government wouldn't be able to design a perfect system but it would be reviewed in time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding for Thriving Kids remains up in the air with federal and state governments yet to strike a deal over who will pay for what.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the uncertainty and anxiety has been heightened all the more, because negotiations between the federal and state governments on another much vaunted plank of NDIS reform known as foundational supports appear to have stalled \u2014 and it remains unclear what those foundational supports will look like.\n\n\n\nIndependent MP Monique Ryan has told the inquiry that while an initial $2 billion in funding has been committed to the program, to be collectively matched by states and territories, there are still questions about exactly what services will be offered and who will pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess the concern is that families want, need and deserve certainty. We're in October 2025, and you're talking about rolling a system out from the first of July 2026. But you're not able to give us any certainty around the timeline for firm agreements between the federal and state governments at this point in time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYellow Ladybugs, a group set up to support autistic girls, expressed concern in August about the changes , in particular around the potential classification of different categories of severe or 'mild' autism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a one size fits all approach that is not customised,\u201d said Katie Koulas, the CEO of Yellow Ladybugs. \"It hasn't had autistic input or approval, so it's actually quite dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal ministers hope an agreement will be struck by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Imagine two scenarios. In the first, you\u2019re hiking uphill on a warm day, beads of sweat rolling down your forehead. In the second, you\u2019ve just remembered you have an exam tomorrow and now the palms of your hands are cold and damp.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth involve sweating but the causes and implications are different.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne scenario produces hot sweat, the other cold sweat. So what\u2019s the difference?\n\n\n\nWhat is hot sweat?\n\nThis type of sweat is also called thermoregulatory sweat. It\u2019s the body\u2019s natural response to increased core body temperature, which most often comes from physical exertion. As sweat evaporates from the skin, it cools down the body to help prevent overheating.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE 700 Australians were recruited for a yoga study. What researchers found surprised them\n\nWhen you\u2019ve been exercising, or are outside on a hot day, your body warms up, then sends a message to the hypothalamus region of your brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour hypothalamus likes to keep your body in an optimum temperature range. So to reduce heat stress it sends signals down the spinal cord and into peripheral nerves (nerves outside the spinal cord and brain). This stimulates secretion of sweat from the eccrine glands in your skin.\n\n\n\n\n\nHumans have millions of eccrine glands, which are packed at a density of 250\u2013550 glands per square centimetre on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Places where you have hair (such as the face, trunk and limbs) have a lower density of eccrine glands.\n\n\n\n\n\nSweat from eccrine glands is mostly water and salt.\n\n\n\nWhat is cold sweat?\n\nCold sweat is also called psychological sweat. It appears when you\u2019re experiencing stress, anxiety, fear or pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese activate the amygdala, the brain region that helps you feel and respond to emotions. The amygdala then activates the hypothalamus.\n\n\n\nCold sweat is a preferred meal for bacteria, creating more of an odour. Source: Getty / Pony Wang The hypothalamus performs multiple functions simultaneously. It sends signals down the spinal cord and into peripheral nerves to stimulate eccrine glands in the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also sends a message to the adrenal glands sitting above the kidneys to release norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) hormones. These hormones travel through the blood and affect a different type of sweat gland in the skin, the apocrine glands.\n\n\n\n\n\nApocrine glands are mainly in the armpit, breasts, face and perineum (where the external genitalia are). Sweat from apocrine glands contains lots of lipids (fats), proteins, sugar and ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs cold sweat triggers eccrine and apocrine glands, you can sweat all over your body.\n\n\n\nWhich type smells more?\n\nSweat itself \u2014 whether hot or cold \u2014 does not smell. But when bacteria on your skin feed on sweat, this produces volatile organic compounds. And it\u2019s these that smell. Blame bacteria such as Corynebacterium, Staphyloccocus and Cutibacterium.\n\n\n\n\n\nA small study from Japan showed stress, not exercise, triggered unpleasant body odours in people who normally don\u2019t have body odour.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s probably because bacteria prefer the cold sweat from apocrine glands. It\u2019s a tasty meal, full of fat, protein and sugars.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother study analysed the results of 26 earlier studies involving 1,652 people. This showed that when we\u2019re frightened, we give off specific smells via our sweat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo yes, fear and stress really do have a distinctive smell that should warn others to stay away.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nThe terms hot and cold sweat don\u2019t refer to the temperature of the sweat itself. The fluid released is always at body temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducing hot sweat is normal and an effective way for your body to lose heat. Cold sweat signals to others that you\u2019re distressed in some way.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your sweating, see your GP. This is especially important if you start sweating more, less, or differently on either side of your body, without changing your lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Meyer is a senior lecturer of anatomy and pathology in the College of Medicine and Dentistry at James Cook University.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonika Zimanyi is an associate professor of anatomy at James Cook University.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeyer is affiliated with the American Association for Anatomy and the Global Neuroanatomy Network.

This was sent Thursday, the 18th of September, 2:45pm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs McIntosh accuses Ms Wells of misleading the parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The minister's office received notification on the Thursday. The minister stood up in parliament yesterday and told the Australian people she did not find out, and her office did not find out, until Friday. The minister has misled the parliament. She has misled the Australian public, and it is clear and plain to see, in this email, as revealed by Senate estimates.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Minister Wells continues to blame Optus, which failed to immediately flag the extent of the outage, including with the regulator, the Australian Media and Communications Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The information that Optus provided to my office on the 18th of September was that there had been a minor outage, it affected 10 calls, that it had been resolved, and most importantly, that there were no adverse impacts on any person. My office sought assurance that ACMA had been informed, ensuring that the regulator was investigating that incident, and ACMA has publicly confirmed that they were informed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior officials in the Department of Communication also criticised Optus for failing to identify the extent of the outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in a dramatic turn of events, they testified that Optus sent its notification about the outage to the wrong email address.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's First Assistant Secretary, Sam Grunhard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ACMA publishes, on its website, the email addresses that the telcos are required by law to send notifications to. The email address is published on their website for all to see so the industry can follow that instruction, and it was not sent to that address.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials testified that the department remained unaware of the extent of the outage until more than 24 hours later, after being contacted by the regulator.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe department's deputy secretary, James Chisholm, says despite the seriousness of the email being sent to a more general inbox, that's not the main issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is totally irrelevant to the question of compliance with the, not only the notification rules, but the actual failure to make triple-zero work, that's the issue here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe failure is being investigated by ACMA, which has also been the subject of tough questioning in terms of what it knew and when.\n\n\n\n\n\nACMA head Nerida O'Loughlin told Senate estimates the regulator only became aware of the extent of the outage on Friday, the 19th of September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In that call, the CEO indicated that the outage had impacted over 600 calls, welfare checks had been undertaken by Optus for around half of those affected customers, with the remainder forwarded to the police to undertake checks. The CEO advised that the welfare checks had identified that three people had passed away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this comes as a bill aimed at enshrining a so-called 'triple-zero custodian' - with end-to-end oversight to ensure the system is working properly - passed the House of Representatives today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt fulfils one of 18 recommendations handed down in April last year, after a review by Richard Bean, which was prompted by an earlier Optus outage in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs O'Loughlin has welcomed the move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We particularly welcome the conferral of powers which will enable the custodian to monitor the health of the triple-zero ecosystem, identify any potential weak spots, and take action that will better protect Australians in their time of the greatest need.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other recommendations remain outstanding, but on Tuesday, Minister Wells said each of these are either being led by industry or dependent on its involvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At my meeting with the chief executives of the three telcos, who I summonsed to Canberra earlier today ahead of introducing the triple-zero custodian legislation, I urged industry to go faster on those remaining four recommendations that they have carriage of, and I'm pleased to update the House that they agreed to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of that work, Optus, Telstra, and TPG have agreed to surprise stress-test drills of their triple-zero systems to make sure they're working properly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as concern mounts in rural and regional areas, particularly, with bushfire season approaching and amid ongoing underlying concerns about poor reception.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for now, the greatest concern is still focused on the questions surrounding Optus itself - some of which were outlined by Ms O'Loughlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fair to say that some of the public comments by Optus raised questions in my mind about its systems and processes, including: why did their systems fail their customers? What testing was done before, during and after the upgrade to make sure triple-zero calls were working? Why did they not know sooner that there was a problem, especially when it had been raised with their call centres? As the regulator, our core responsibility is to look into compliance issues arising from such events, and we are doing so as a priority.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Cancer survival rates have improved significantly over the past 25 years, according to a wide-ranging report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), but there has also been what one researcher says are concerning rises in some diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report, published on Wednesday, looked at cancer prevalence , survival rates, incidence, mortality and risk for more than 100 different types of cancer over time and across multiple factors including age, state and territory and country of birth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of cancer diagnoses in Australia has increased markedly in recent decades, which is partly due to increases in population size and an increasing number of people reaching older ages.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000, there were around 88,000 cases of cancer diagnosed. In 2025, it's estimated that 170,000 cases will be diagnosed.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Melanie was sceptical of this underutilised cancer treatment. It saved her life\n\nThe report found close to one million people have been diagnosed with cancer in the last 10 years, and this year, around three of every 10 deaths are estimated to be due to cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Bernard Stewart, a cancer researcher from the University of NSW, told SBS News that data on the incidence of cancer and deaths due to cancer provide \"crucial insight\" for the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The incidence can, in some cases, give us an insight into causes of cancer. The deaths give us insight into the success or otherwise we have had of treating particular cancer types, in so far as establishing cancer survivorship \u2014 if not cure,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStewart said the amount of data available about the incidence of cancer and deaths caused by it reflects the extent of community concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The community has determined worldwide and in high-income countries in particular that cancer is of such concern we, the community, want to know what's going on,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording of cancer incidence is mandatory in all Australian states and territories, with the recording of cancer deaths also captured in mortality data.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what else did the data show?\n\n\n\nSurvival rates\n\nSurvival rates for cancer have increased as a whole in Australia over the past three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2025, the cancer mortality rate (standardised for an ageing population) decreased from 257 deaths per 100,000 to an estimated 194 deaths.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Source: SBS News The five-year survival rate (the percentage of people diagnosed with a cancer who survived for at least five years past diagnosis) increased from 50 to 72 per cent over a 30-year period between 1987-1991 and 2017-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the same period, the five-year survival rate for breast cancer among women improved from 75 to 93 per cent and, for men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the five-year survival rate increased from 60 to 96 per cent.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News AIHW spokesperson Justin Harvey said the chances of surviving prostate cancer or breast cancer \"have been gradually improving over time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLung cancer, while the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia this year, is responsible for more deaths than any other cancer and has the lowest five-year survival rate.\n\n\n\nRising cancer rates among young people\n\nWhile outcomes are improving, the report also found cancer incidence rates for younger people aged 30 to 49 are increasing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, cancer rates for people in their 30s have risen from 121 to 135 cases per 100,000 people in Australia in the past 25 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor people in their 40s, rates have increased from 280 to 313 cases per 100,000 over the same period.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The report found an increased rate of thyroid and colorectal cancer among people in their 30s and an increased rate of thyroid, breast, prostate, colorectal and kidney cancer for people in their 40s.\n\n\n\n\n\nStewart said it's not clear what's causing the rise in certain cancers among younger people, and trying to pinpoint what's behind it is complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to concern about rising rates of some cancers among young people, Stewart said there is also concern about these cancers not receiving fast attention from GPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The possibility of colorectal cancer [among people in their 30s and 40s] was virtually unknown and is now becoming increasingly a matter that has to be taken into account,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News However, while cancer is becoming more common for people in their 30s and 40s, \"cancer mortality rates for these age groups have generally been decreasing\", Harvey said.\n\n\n\nMelanoma rates\n\nWhile younger people in their 30s and 40s have seen a significant decrease in melanoma of the skin since 2000, age-standardised rates for melanoma have increased across the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past 25 years, melanoma rates have increased from 54 to 63 per 100,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis rise is being driven by older age brackets, and melanoma rates for people under 40 have been decreasing since the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The 'hidden' Australian skin cancer problem that has researchers concerned\n\nThe report said public health campaigns like the Slip Slop Slap campaign had driven high awareness of skin cancer risks for people born after or around the time the campaign was released.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are increasing rates of melanoma among older Australians \u2014 people who are likely to have spent more of their lives in times when there was less skin cancer awareness.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Many Australians unaware of blood cancer symptoms, research finds SBS News 05:43 English\n\n\"Melanoma has been addressed vigorously in terms of prevention by making people aware of the role of sunlight and of course the Slip Slop Slap campaign \u2014 now extended to 'slide' on sunglasses and 'seek' shelter,\" Stewart said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That has been remarkably successful in this country.\"\n\n\n\nDifferences between men and women\n\nMen are, overall, more likely to be diagnosed with cancer \u2014 although the gap between men and women has tightened since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, 727 men per 100,000 are estimated to be diagnosed with cancer, while 488 women per 100,000 are estimated to be diagnosed.\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer for men and for Australians overall, and 29,000 cases are estimated to be diagnosed this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer for women, and around 20,000 diagnoses are expected this year.\n\n\n\n",

I think they're just all so glad to be out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Foreign Minister Penny Wong has confirmed the release of the Australians - who were among the group of 131 activists released after the Global Sumud Flotilla was intercepted in international waters by Israel's military last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere remain seven people in detention from the 479 originally detained.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Pullman says it has been frustrating getting information about her daughter's situation from officials with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - but help of Australian consular staff in Jordan in the last 12 hours has been invaluable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was able to convey she was okay. And that she was really relieved to be out. And they at that point, the (Australian) embassy took them all to be checked over at a hospital. A Red Cross hospital, I think. So that was a very good thing that the Australian consular officials did to make sure that they were all in good health. They had a general physical checkup. And she was in that process when she spoke to me. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts of the conditions of the detention have now emerged from activists who have since returned home after being among the first to be deported from Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the activists were held at the Ketziot high-security prison in southern Israel, which is used to detain Palestinians who are accused by Israel of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Stockholm, environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg says she didn't get clean water - and other detainees were deprived of critical medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are now many who are safe and released from imprisonment and absurd mistreatment. But many of our comrades from the Global Sumud Flotilla are not, and they need to be released now. But most importantly, we are not the story. Thousands of Palestinians are currently being held in Israeli dungeons without a trial. Hundreds of which are children. Millions are living trapped under an illegal siege.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving at Istanbul Airport, Malaysian activist Iylia Balqis says the protocols detainees were subjected to were degrading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very disgusting how they treated us in the prison. They had a very much protocol, so-called protocol just to make us feel so disgusted with ourselves. And we had to change our clothes. And then they will put us into a cage under a very sunny bright. And then they didn't treat us as a hijabi. Some of our Muslim women, they even denied their hijab. And then when we were in cell, they didn't even give us clean water and also medicine. Even when we asked and one woman was in serious dire need of medicine, they denied it. They say if she didn't die yet, then it's okay. And then we had to drink from the tap water in the toilet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights barrister, Jen Robinson is representing the seven Australian flotilla activists - Abubakir Rafiq, Juliet Lamont, Hamish Paterson, Surya McEwan, Bianca Webb-Pullman, Cameron Tribe and Dan Adler.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the treatment experienced by the group included multiple instances of rights violations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" The seven Australian humanitarians participating in the Global Flotilla were intercepted by Israel in international waters in violation of international law. We have since received shocking accounts of human rights violations committed during their arrest and detention. This has included inhuman and degrading treatment, physical abuse, sleep deprivation, threats of sexual violence, insufficient or unclean food and water, the confiscation of medicines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Foreign Minister Matt Thistlethwaite earlier said the Australian government officials had conveyed views to the Israeli government [[through consular staff]] that the Australians detained should be treated in accordance with international law - and released as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry released a series of statements, including earlier ones which said the detained activists were \"safe and in good health\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a later statement, it denied allegations of torture and mistreatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the legal rights of the participants in this PR stunt are fully upheld. Don\u2019t believe the fake news they are spreading.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla say that it is the largest maritime mission to Gaza to date: 51 ships and delegations from at least 44 countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow another convoy of boats, part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, is sailing towards Gaza, with a similar mission of carrying humanitarian supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnboard the ship Conscience with nearly 100 people is freelance journalist and human rights lawyer Thomas Becker.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there is concern for what they might face from Israeli authorities as they approach Gaza, but those on board the vessel are determined to complete their mission regardless.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "By the time Optus had contacted the communications authority and the minister\u2019s office, hundreds of users had been unable to contact emergency services; the South Australian Police, Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, and customers had contacted the telco to let them know something was wrong. Three people died while unable to contact Triple Zero during the outage. Loading How could a telecommunications company mess up an email address? Both emails sent from Optus to ACMA on the afternoon of September 18 were sent to incorrect addresses, despite the carrier telling the authority they had the correct email address six days earlier. On September 11, a week before the network outage, Optus was informed by ACMA that the email address the telco should contact to raise an alert about network issues had changed. On the same day, the authority updated its website to reflect that change. The following day, Optus updated its internal IT systems to reflect the change, confirming this with the watchdog.\n\nBetween September 11 and October 8, Optus sent 272 emails to the correct address \u2013 around 10 emails per day. However, on the day of the catastrophic outage, September 18, Optus sent two emails to the old address that was no longer monitored regularly. Based on testimony from the Department of Communications at Senate estimates on Wednesday, these were the only emails within that period to be sent to the incorrect address. Why did Optus only raise the alarm after the outage was over? The first contact from Optus to raise alarms about the outage came 14 hours after the crisis had started, and almost an hour after upgrade works were paused and the system began to be restored. Optus CEO Stephen Rue himself said that he was aware of the severity of the crisis at 1.30pm on September 18, but the watchdog was not notified for a further 70 minutes. Telcos are obliged to notify Telstra, which operates Triple Zero call centres, and ACMA \u201cas soon as possible\u201d after a significant network outage. Was email forwarding too difficult for the Department of Communications?\n\nThe new email for emergency notification was established by the Department of Communications just a week before Optus\u2019 network outage, yet the department had not established any forwarding system so that messages sent to the defunct account would still be seen. Representatives for the department repeatedly said at Senate estimates this week that the fault clearly lay with Optus for sending alerts to the wrong email. However, in their own testimony, they said they had told telco companies that the defunct email would be monitored occasionally. While the emails were sent after the crisis was rectified, and their arrival at a correct address would have done little to solve the problem, it is unclear why a basic mail-forwarding system was not in operation. Why did Optus stay silent about the deaths for almost 24 hours? Optus chief executive Stephen Rue informed the minister, the industry watchdog and the public that there were deaths during the network outage on the afternoon of September 19. However, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young told Senate estimates on Wednesday that when she met with Rue on Tuesday he told her the telco was aware of deaths on the evening of September 18, and he personally became aware of them at 9am on September 19.\n\nOptus chief Stephen Rue attempts to leave Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday, but falls foul of the security gates. Credit: Nine News While the exact time Optus employees became aware of the deaths on September 18 is unknown, there is a significant delay in informing the public, the minister, the department, or the watchdog. Is anyone with teeth investigating? Optus\u2019s board has appointed Kerry Schott, the former CEO of Sydney Water, to lead an independent review into the September 18 outage. The company has also employed American firm Kearney to oversee its Triple Zero operations and its network more broadly on an ongoing basis. A second review from ACMA will investigate the outage, and both will report publicly. However, both the opposition and the Greens have criticised the measures, saying Optus and the watchdog cannot be trusted to oversee the reviews. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson went so far as to describe ACMA\u2019s review as \u201clike putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank\u201d.\n\nThe Coalition unsuccessfully moved on Wednesday to establish a House select committee to investigate the outage, which the government voted down. However, Hanson-Young said she is determined to establish a \u201cfull-blown parliamentary inquiry\u201d once the Senate next sits at the end of the month. A vote from the Coalition, Greens and crossbenchers could easily see the inquiry established, and if this week\u2019s senate estimates are any sign of what\u2019s to come, it would not be an easy ride for Optus. Did Communications Minister Anika Wells fail? The opposition has run a concerted campaign this week to lay blame over the crisis at Wells\u2019 feet. Some of their accusations, including the claim that Optus\u2019 emails were \u201csecret\u201d don\u2019t hold much water after Wells office repeatedly pointed to her addressing them on September 22. However, Wells and the former minister Michelle Rowland sat on key recommendations from the Bean review into Optus\u2019 previous major outage in 2023 for 17 months, only completing two-thirds of them by September 18.\n\nIt was not until the September 18 outage that Wells said the government was fast-tracking legislation to empower a Triple Zero custodian to oversee the emergency services call ecosystem, despite the recommendation being accepted some 16 months prior. The custodian group already exists within the Department of Communications, but was toothless without the legislation. Loading Another issue was the fact that Wells travelled to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City just days after the outage. She defended her actions, saying she was advocating to world leaders about the government\u2019s under-16 social media ban, describing the proposition as having the capacity to \u201cchange the world\u201d. Finally, Wells described herself as \u201cstill a new minister\u201d to the portfolio as she worked through the issue. Coming almost five months after her appointment to the role, the opposition has made political hay of the comment. Why hasn\u2019t the Optus CEO resigned yet?",

But an unsettling experience with celebrity chef Guy Grossi from 2018 left her wondering about the narratives promoted, and hidden, by Australia\u2019s hospitality industry. \u201cThe media is so stuck on this narrative of the legendary family name that has these big grand restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand that\u2019s an important story and there\u2019s a desire to want that facade to be real. But are we going to engage with reality or keep telling the romantic story while sidelining the problems?\u201d Guy Grossi has sold his Bourke Street empire. Pegrum was a 24-year-old food reviewer when she was asked to cover an exclusive event at Grossi\u2019s newly opened restaurant in Perth, Garum, on September 13, 2018. The evening was promoted as one of \u201cRoman inspired\u201d food and fine wines under Grossi\u2019s \u201cwatchful eye\u201d that was \u201csure to be a sell-out\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the meals were served, Pegrum said she introduced herself to Grossi as a journalist and asked to take his photograph for her work\u2019s social media page. \u201cHe was clearly very drunk by this point,\u201d Pegrum said. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not having a photo unless you\u2019re in it\u2019.\u201d Pegrum said she repeatedly declined, but was ignored. Loading \u201cHe grabbed me in a forced hug, picked me up off the ground, started spinning me around,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember feeling totally humiliated.\u201d This masthead corroborated Pegrum\u2019s account with two sources who were told about the incident. Grossi denied the claims through lawyers. \u201cThe behaviour you have described is not only unsubstantiated but is calculated to cause harm to Mr Grossi\u2019s impeccable and well-deserved reputation as an icon of the Australian food and dining industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, Grossi confirmed plans to sell his famous Grossi Florentino restaurant, and a string of other venues on Bourke Street, that have been managed by his family for 26 years. This masthead reported earlier this week the Bourke Street restaurants will be sold to the hospitality group run by Rebecca Yazbek, who owns Nomad restaurant and Reine & La Rue in Melbourne and other venues in Sydney.\n\nThe news has reverberated around Melbourne\u2019s hospitality industry \u2013 a significant change of hands for an institution central to the city\u2019s history and identity since the doors opened in 1928. Pegrum said amid the fanfare, the industry needed to tackle important conversations about the next generation of hospitality leaders. \u201cHow do we create an industry that is not celebrating people over and over who are exploiting people? What are we missing? Who are we not championing?\u201d Family business Grossi\u2019s parents migrated to Australia from Italy in 1960, after an invitation from Mario Vigano, the owner of Australia\u2019s earliest Italian restaurant, Mario\u2019s, to work in his kitchen as a chef.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe restaurant was then located on Exhibition Street, where guests dined on authentic Italian food for the first time to live music played by men wearing bowties and sparkling jackets. Grossi didn\u2019t always want to follow his father\u2019s footsteps as a chef, and told journalists over the years of how he resented his childhood spent helping his father in the kitchen peeling potatoes and scrubbing floors. But something changed and Grossi trained under notable chef Hermann Schneider, who he described in food podcast The Luminaries as a \u201chard taskmaster\u201d who gave him a \u201clevel of discipline I never experienced before\u201d. Grossi was 25 years old when he opened his first restaurant Quadri with his wife Melissa, serving Italian food to a suburban crowd. He excelled quickly, opening restaurants around Melbourne with his father and sister \u2013 Tolarno, Cafe Grossi, Massoni, Two Faces, the list goes on. Guy Grossi in the Florentino dining room in 1999. Credit: Luis Ascui His greatest achievement was signing the lease to Florentino in 1999 - regarded as the city\u2019s oldest restaurant - that was long admired by his father. The heritage-listed, white-tablecloth venue hosted everyone from prime ministers to gangland figures. Mick Gatto\u2019s book launch was held there in 2009. Food commentator Cam Smith said Grossi Florentino had been in the family\u2019s blood for a \u201cvery, very long time\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat restaurant in a way is a little bit like the Patek Philippe watch \u2013 you don\u2019t own it, you look after it for the next generation.\u201d Running the venue alongside his sister and son, Grossi treated customers like family too, hosting Christmas lunches at Florentino each year \u2013 serving festive menus on long tables of bon bons. Guy Grossi\u2019s Christmas lunches at Florentino. Credit: Mark Chew Under his stewardship, Grossi retained the restaurant\u2019s multiple hats for most of its life, invested in a massive new oven and opened more diverse dining options downstairs, including Grossi Grill, Cellar Bar and Arlechin bar. He grew a celebrity profile, authoring award-winning cookbooks, appearing on MasterChef and headlining major events like the Australian Open. However, beneath the glossy magazine features and rolling public praise was another story. This masthead published an investigation earlier this year revealing allegations of Grossi\u2019s inappropriate behaviour towards female staff stretching back more than a decade. Grossi emerged as a divisive culinary leader during interviews with dozens of current and former staff. Some said he was a great mentor, while others said he sexualised young waitresses he employed, commenting on their appearances and touching their bodies without consent. Others described a sexist culture where complaints about staff harassment were brushed aside. Grossi issued a public apology to one senior industry leader who accused him of groping her breast at an industry event in 2022, but denied all wrongdoing and defended his conduct and his restaurants\u2019 workplace culture.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size A funny thing happened on the way to Australia, 50 years ago, before cricket\u2019s calendar was drafted by the dollar. Clive Lloyd\u2019s West Indies stopped off in Papua New Guinea and played two games against the local national team, on canvas pitches stretched over concrete. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it was,\u201d Lloyd, now 81, says from his London home. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s all those years ago, I still remember it like yesterday. Wonderful country, wonderful people. They made us feel thoroughly at home.\u201d The timing was exquisite. Four months earlier, Lloyd\u2019s team had defeated Australia at Lord\u2019s to win cricket\u2019s inaugural World Cup. The imminent 1975-76 summer \u2013 a world Test championship before it had a name \u2013 \u201cdidn\u2019t end up too well, cricket-wise,\u201d Lloyd reflects. \u201cBut it was a learning curve.\u201d Indeed. Other than a 1-0 glitch in India when weakened by Kerry Packer\u2019s breakaway World Series, the rampant West Indies didn\u2019t lose another Test series until 1995. For cricket fans in PNG (there were and still are many), the October stopover crowned a party that began on September 16, when independence was achieved after decades of being governed as a territory of Australia. The significance was not lost on Lloyd, whose native Guyana experienced a similar cutting of the apron strings from Great Britain in 1966, the year he played the first of his 110 Tests. \u201cYou could see the Australians and the locals were very together \u2013 they were helping them in trying to move forward as a nation. We were the first people to celebrate with them. We found it a very special occasion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGames were played on consecutive days, in Lae and Port Moresby. Snippets of footage show the squad arriving at the airport, Lloyd interviewed on the tarmac by Richie Benaud (big-collared \u201970s shirt unbuttoned to the sternum). There is some action from the Lae game, and delightful footage of kids in the crowd, agog as the West Indians do some catching practice next to buai (betel nut) trees with Mt Herzog in the distance. Gordon Greenidge wears the same pale blue terry-towelling hat he\u2019d donned in the World Cup final. At a drinks break, he takes a glass from a tray, swigs something too sweet, and promptly spits it on the ground.

A beaming local waiter displays platters of nibbles that would have done Don\u2019s Party proud. Kentish tells the gathering the West Indies have visited \u201cas a gesture to show ourselves as potential leaders in world cricket\u201d. Lloyd\u2019s most vivid memory is enjoying a \u201cmumu\u201d, a traditional meal of meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in coals in the earth. \u201cIt\u2019s something people used to do in the West Indies years ago. And the meat was so soft, it was wonderful.\u201d The Windies were welcomed by PNG fans. Credit: YouTube He remembers \u201csome very good cricketers\u201d playing for PNG, too. Among them in the Moresby game was Ilinome Tarua, who had much to celebrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowing up on Kwato Island, at PNG\u2019s south-eastern tip, Tarua absorbed his fast-bowling father\u2019s love of cricket. \u201cWe had a radio. When overseas cricket was on, we put the radio on wherever we go. My father was a great supporter of the West Indies.\u201d In 1972, he was one of the first two law graduates from the University of Papua New Guinea, where he also captained the cricket team. The next year he had oversight to PNG\u2019s self-governance, and by the time the Windies came calling, he was Prime Minister Michael Somare\u2019s legal advisor. Now 83 and living in Sydney, he\u2019s excited to revisit everything about that time, not least the cricket. \u201cI still have a feeling about the wonderful experience I had playing against them, even though it was overwhelming.\u201d Five decades on, the sense of opportunity lost in his inning of nine runs remains. \u201cViv Richards was bowling and I misread him, I was really annoyed with myself,\u201d Tarua says. \u201cI was looking for the spin and it was a straight ball!\u201d Vic Richards in 1975. Credit: The Age High Commission postings took him to London and New Zealand; Tarua was also PNG\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Germany, Italy, Israel and Greece. He and wife Susan, who met at university, moved to Sydney in 1991 after his last diplomatic service role, as consul general. He played cricket throughout, captaining teams and making runs, including an unbeaten hundred. And after playing against the mighty West Indies, he bowled part-time spin \u2013 just like Viv. \u201cI tried to copy him!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaunao Vai observed a more high-octane impact on young locals who saw the West Indies win by 70 runs in the 25-over Lae game, and 86 runs in a 40-over contest the next day at Port Moresby\u2019s Sir Hubert Murray Stadium. \u201cThe young generation, the teenagers, they started to copy the fast bowlers,\u201d Vai says. \u201cThey thought, yeah, fast bowling was it! Everyone started taking the long run-ups.\u201d An opening batter who was studying economics at UPNG, Vai credits the dean of the law faculty \u2013 a well-connected West Indian named Professor James \u2013 with making the quirky micro-tour happen. Lloyd\u2019s recall runs no deeper than simple good manners \u2013 sensing an unforgettable independence celebration opportunity, Cricket PNG proffered an invitation, and the Windies said sure, why not? Mark Davis is originally from Melbourne, and was working as a journalist with the Post Courier. He met local woman Olive when he stopped in PNG at the start of a planned \u201cgrand tour\u201d of the world, and stayed put. He played cricket with Olive\u2019s brothers, and remembers the Port Moresby competition being strong, the Lae one competitive, and smaller comps in Rabaul, Hagen and Goroka. \u201cWhen I first went there in 1974 there were a lot of expats playing,\u201d Davis says. \u201cThe main Moresby competition was a pretty high standard \u2013 there were some damn good players who\u2019d played district cricket in Australia. In the next few years they became fundamentally PNG sides with locals playing. Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were thrashed in Australia that summer, but went on to dominate world cricket. Credit: YouTube \u201cAs independence moved along, a fair whack of the expatriate community left and the PNG community became more and more important in both cricket and footy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPNG became an associate member of the ICC in 1973, and has competed in the ICC Trophy since 1979. Vai played a dozen times for his country, including three tours to England. He remains a Cricket PNG board member, and is looking forward to the Barramundis tackling Samoa and Oman in October in pursuit of a third T20 World Cup appearance in 2026. The West Indies coming to town remains an untouchable memory. \u201cI faced the first ball of the match, bowled by Andy Roberts,\u201d Vai says. \u201cI can remember that very, very well. Quite hesitant, but I thought it was a very exciting occasion, so I took the punt. And it was a short one too!\u201d He made one before lunging forward to Bernard Julien and popping a catch to Greenidge in his blue hat. His opening partner, Nigel Agonia, played in both games, carrying his bat for an unbeaten 36 in Lae and backing up with 14. An average of 50 v the West Indies puts him in rare company. His all-round talents were such that commentator Jim Maxwell, when asked the scariest bowler he\u2019d seen, recalled that Agonia \u201cfrightened the hell out of everyone\u201d during his school days in Sydney.

Ben Stokes\u2019 England will play five Tests and spend the rest of their three-month tour training (and playing golf). Ili Tarua and Taunao Vai know well what the game has lost.\n\nAdvertisement",

Rinderknecht fled the scene after starting the fire, but returned to the same trail to watch it burn, acting US Attorney Bill Essayli said during a news conference. \u201cHe left as soon as he saw the fire trucks were headed to the location. He turned around and went back up there. And he took some video and watched them fight the fire,\u201d Essayli said. Uber said in a statement that it worked with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine the driver\u2019s whereabouts around the time of the fire.\n\nRinderknecht also made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint. During an interview on January 24, Rinderknecht told investigators where the fire began, information not yet public and that he would not have known if he hadn\u2019t witnessed it, according to the criminal complaint. A person walks on the beach next to homes destroyed by the Palisades fire. Credit: AP He lied about his location, claiming he was near the bottom of the hiking trail, Essayli said. The suspect was visibly anxious during that interview, according to the complaint. His efforts to call 911 and his question to ChatGPT about a cigarette lighting a fire indicated he \u201cwanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire, and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire\u201d, the complaint said.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, investigators found a ChatGPT prompt by Rinderknecht asking the chatbot to make a \u201cdystopian painting\u201d showing a crowd fleeing from a burning forest and poor people trying to get past a gate with a \u201cbig dollar sign on it\u201d. Loading \u201cOn the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people,\u201d the prompt allegedly read. \u201cThey are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle.\u201d Investigators determined the January 1 fire was intentionally lit, likely by a lighter taken to vegetation or paper, according to the criminal complaint. They excluded other possibilities, including fireworks, lightning and power lines. Authorities also looked into whether a cigarette may have caused the fire, but concluded that it was not the cause, the complaint says.\n\nInvestigators found a \u201cbarbecue-style\u201d lighter inside the glove box of Rinderknecht\u2019s car on January 24. It appeared to be the same lighter as the one that was in his apartment on December 31, based on a photo on his phone. He admitted to bringing a lighter with him when he walked up the hill. Federal prosecutors will need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Palisades Fire grew from that blaze that broke out six days earlier, said Jerod Gunsberg, a California criminal defence lawyer with experience in arson cases. Homes ablaze in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles on January 7., Credit: Philip Cheung/The New York Times But he said that was something defence lawyers are likely to question. \u201cThe defence is going to say, \u2018How do we know it was the same guy? There\u2019s a lot of time that went on in between these two fires\u2019,\u201d said Gunsberg, who is not involved in the Palisades case. \u201cSo the prosecutors will have to show that evidence.\u201d\n\nEven if firefighters thought the original fire was extinguished, he said, that does not absolve someone from being held accountable. \u201cYou\u2019re not off the hook,\u201d Gunsberg said. Loading Investigators still haven\u2019t determined the cause of a second blaze, the Eaton Fire, which broke out the same day in the community of Altadena and killed 19 people. Both fires reduced block after block of entire neighbourhoods to grey and black debris, destroying homes, schools, businesses and churches. While rebuilding is underway in some neighbourhoods, it will take years. Many home owners will not be able to afford it, even those with insurance. An outside review released in September found that a lack of resources and outdated policies for sending emergency alerts led to delayed evacuation warnings.",
