(Getty)\n\n\"My understanding is that will be lifted as a result of a decade-long review.\ufeff\"\n\nMeat and Livestock Australia managing director Michael Crowley said in a statement that there was \"unlikely\" to be any adverse effect on Australian cattle producers.\n\n\"The potential for US beef to be imported into Australia in large volumes is minimal, given the high demand for beef in the US, the low US cattle herd, the strength of the Australian dollar, our competitive domestic supply, and most importantly Australians' strong preference for high-quality, tasty and nutritious Australian beef,\" he said.\n\n\"Australia produces approximately three times more beef than needed to feed our population. Around 70 per cent of our production is exported to global markets.\"\n\nHe said US demand for Australian beef continued to grow\ufeff, up 24 per cent year-on-year in June, despite a 10 per cent tariff already in place.\n\nThe removal of the ban was first reported by the Australian Financial Review , quoting an anonymous government source.\n\n\ufeffThat source emphasised that Australia's biosecurity would remain uncompromised by the change, a stance Rishworth also took.\n\nDonald Trump announces his global tariffs in April.

And our farmers very much benefit from being able to export their products right around the world.\"\n\nCrowley said the MLA supported \"science-based decisions\".\n\n\"The Australian government decision to permit beef imports from the United States and Canada follows a comprehensive risk assessment, ensuring that all biosecurity protocols and import conditions meet Australia's high standards,\" he said.\n\n\"The finalised federal government health certification and import permit conditions reflect stringent safeguards to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases and uphold the integrity of Australia's biosecurity system.\"\ufeff\n\nThe revelation comes ahead of US President Donald Trump's proclaimed August 1 deadline for increased blanket tariffs on imports to the US.\n\nThere are fears for Australia's biosecurity. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAustralia is currently subjected to a baseline 10 per cent tariff on all US exports, including beef, \ufeffwith a 50 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium.\n\nTrump has also threatened to increase the tariff on imported pharmaceuticals to 200 per cent.\n\nThe baseline tariff could as much as double to 20 per cent on the August 1 deadline, Trump warned in recent \ufeffweeks.\n\nIn April, when rolling out his \"Liberation Day\" tariff plan, Trump singled out Australian beef.\n\nWith a jump from a cliff, two men changed thrillseeking View Gallery\n\n\"Australia bans \u2013 and they're wonderful people, and wonderful everything \u2013 but they ban American beef,\" he said then.\n\n\"Yet we imported $US3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone.\ufeff\n\n\"They won't take any of our beef.\n\n\"They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and you know, I don't blame them but we're doing the same thing right now starting at midnight tonight, I would say.\"\n\nA ban on beef imports from the US was put in place more than 20 years ago after an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, which can lead to fatal brain disease in humans.\n\nThe blanket ban was lifted in 2019 for cattle raised and slaughtered in the US, but remained for cattle that had been raised in Canda and Mexico, but slaughtered in and exported from\ufeff the US.\n\nIt's those latter bans which have now been lifted, after the review reportedly found the US had improved its tracking protocols.\ufeff\n\nAustralia exported nearly $3 billion in beef in 2023, with the United States the biggest market.\n\nBut it only imported $10 million of beef in that year, mostly from Japan or New Zealand.\ufeff",

        "text": "Young Australians say they are still facing decades of repayments for their student loans, despite Labor introducing a bill to slash HECS debts by 20 percent.\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare tabled the bill on Wednesday as the re-elected Albanese government's first act in parliament.\n\nClare said the legislation would cut the debt of three million Australians, with the average HECS debt of $27,600 being reduced by around $5500.\n\nJulia Wilding says she will still be saddled with an enormous debt, even after a 20 percent reduction. (Supplied: Julia Wilding)\n\nThe reform will also raise the minimum amount before people have to start making HECS repayments from $54,435 to $67,000 and reduce minimum repayments.\n\n\"This is a big deal for three million Australians, in particular, a lot of young Australians,\" Clare said.\n\n\"Just out of uni, just getting started, this will take a weight off their back.\"\n\nWestern Australian Julia Wilding graduated from six years of study to become an optometrist in 2023.\n\nThe 25-year-old was left with a HECS debt of $130,000, and also paid $34,000 for her final six months of study upfront as she had reached the cap on the amount she could borrow from the government.\n\nWilding said while she welcomed the $26,000 reduction in her HECS debt, it still felt like \"a drop in the ocean\".\n\nWilding calculated it would take her about 30 years to pay off her HECS debt, and that was before the annual indexation applied to her loan was taken into account.\n\n\"At this rate, I'll still probably be in my 50s when I finally pay it off - and I was 17 when I started uni. It's quite depressing.\"\n\nWilding said she loved her job and did not regret going to university to study in her chosen field, however, the cost of her education was onerous.\n\n\"The financial road is very difficult. When I think about it, it's just such an inordinate amount of money, that you just have to laugh about it sometimes,\" she said.\n\nSydney woman Katie, who asked for her surname to be withheld, has a HECS debt of around $110,000 after graduating with three degrees - one in the arts, another in classical music and a third in publishing.\n\nShe now works in the not-for-profit sector and estimates that she will be in her 80s by the time she pays off her HECS debt, assuming she continues to work full-time.\n\n\"I appreciate any reductions,\" Katie said.\n\n\"However, I do think that all HECS debts should be erased. It's a little bit difficult to take seriously the argument for not doing that when most of the people making those arguments got their education for free, but any relief is good relief.\"\n\nStudents are seen walking through the Sydney University's campus. (Flavio Brancaleone)\n\nKatie said there were a number of ways the government could make things easier for students struggling with growing HECS debts, including bringing back government co-payments for voluntary contributions, or making extra contributions tax deductible.\n\nA common complaint of the current HECS system is its yearly indexation schedule.\n\nWhile HECS repayments are taken out of a person's salary throughout the year, these payments are kept aside by the ATO and not deducted from the total amount owing until after indexation is applied on June 1.\n\nKatie said this process seemed particularly unfair and should be changed.\n\n\"They take your money out of our paycheck each pay cycle, but they don't actually pay it off until they've added the indexation, which kind of feels a bit like a slap in the face.\"\n\nIt's a call echoed by Senator David Pocock, who told parliament he wanted to see the date of indexation altered.\n\n\"It is outrageous that people with HECS debts are being charged indexation, effectively interest, on money they've already repaid to the ATO,\" he says.\n\nPocock said the federal government needed to \"stop going for the headline\" and \"embrace hard reform\" when came to higher education.\n\nA wide-ranging review of the entire university system, called the Universities Accord, was commissioned by the federal government, and its findings were released in February, 2024.\n\nClare said the government had already taken steps to address some of the recommendations included in the report, including introducing payments for students completing practical work placements as part of their studies.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to do to make our higher education system better and fairer,\" Clare said, adding the next move would be to look at changing the funding system to be more \"needs-based\" and follow individual students, a reform which would benefit disadvantaged backgrounds and students from regional Australia.",

(File: ABC News)\n\n\"The more clients are going through revolving doors, eventually, they just give up.\n\n\"This has been extremely frustrating because I'm trying to advocate for clients and for best client care, but it's like words are falling on deaf ears, they are not taking concerns seriously.\"\n\nRamsay Health Care is Australia's largest private provider of psychology services, and its clinics see a range of high-risk patients with various mental health conditions, including young children, for conditions like depression or PTSD.\n\nThe provider also runs separate mental health clinics, however they will not be affected by the change.\n\nA briefing note sent to staff said three clinics \u2014 in Cairns, Charlestown and Joondalup \u2014 would remain open, and it was \"exploring the merits\" of expanding its existing psychology telehealth services.\n\nBut the note said Ramsay Health Care was not \"stepping away from mental health care\".\n\n\"We remain committed to supporting high-quality, accessible services, whether in hospitals, in communities or online,\" the note said.\n\n\"This decision reflects a growing community demand for mental health support that is easy to access, flexible, convenient and connected to other services.\"\n\nA Health Department review into the viability of the private hospital system, commissioned by the Albanese government and published in summary last year, identified declining mental health services as a major issue.\n\nIt noted the sector had raised concerns about access to private hospital psychiatric services, and the difficulty in attracting and retaining psychiatrists prepared to work in a hospital setting.\n\nWhile the number of Medicare-subsidised psychiatric services increased by almost 20 per cent from 2018-19 to 2021-22, the number of services delivered in a private setting dropped by about 15 per cent over the same time period.\n\n'Decision will place public system under pressure'\n\nPsychiatrist Patrick McGorry said there was a \"great risk\" the clinic closures would see some patients left without care.

(ABC Alice Springs: Lee Robinson)\n\nAFL NT fights for venue\n\nThe council voted to reverse the ban after the head of AFL NT, Sam Gibson, wrote to the council earlier this month.\n\nIn the letter, Mr Gibson identified ways to mitigate the concerns of the council and proposed the football games again be held at Traegar Park.\n\n\"[AFL] is a key pillar of positive social engagement and community cohesion throughout the Territory,\" he said.\n\n\"To achieve a safe, fun and engaging finals series, AFL NT requires an appropriate venue.\n\n\"Community venues do not have the appropriate infrastructure such as change rooms or secure fencing.\"\n\nAFL NT says it will be safer to host community football finals in Alice Springs than in community. (ABC Alice Springs: Charmayne Allison)\n\nMr Gibson wrote that \"in the unlikely event that an incident was to occur\", Traegar Park's high fences provided a better option for crowd control and a safer environment.\n\nHe said remote communities lacked access to \"adequate wrap-around supports\" and \"services that are required with the influx of people\".\n\nMr Gibson also highlighted a number of risk mitigation strategies to encourage community members' \"positive social behaviours and safe travels home\" after the finals games finished in Alice Springs.\n\nCouncillor backflips\n\nCouncillor Allison Bitar was in favour of the finals ban in August due to \"planning and safety\" concerns, but this week changed her mind and was among the councillors voting to reverse the ban.\n\nShe said after reading AFL NT's proposal, she felt assured mitigation methods would keep community residents in community and reduce antisocial behaviour in town.\n\n\"Last year [the finals] were played back to back, this year we've got an additional week between each game,\" she said.\n\nMs Bitar says she changed her mind on the finals ban. (ABC Alice Springs: Xavier Martin)\n\n\"AFL NT have also worked with charter companies so they'll be able to help people return home in between those games as well.\n\n\"Plus they've also got some programs happening out at communities in the weeks following [the finals] that means there is a reason to go back home rather than stay in town.\"\n\nAdditionally, she said some of the finals games would be live streamed in communities to minimise the need for community residents to travel to Alice Springs to see the game.\n\nFinals to go ahead\n\nThe Central Australian Football League bush competition's finals series will go ahead at Traegar Park next month.\n\nA preliminary final will be played on August 10 and the grand final will be held on August 24.\n\nBoth games start at 1pm.\n\nThe CAFL community football finals will return to Traegar Park in August. (ABC Alice Springs: Xavier Martin)\n\nMr Paterson said he hoped the AFL NT's mitigation strategies were effective.\n\n\"I really do want people playing football ... I hope it goes seamless on the 24th of August and the 10th of August and AFL NT can say 'I told you so' and I'd be happy for that,\" he said.",

        "text": "Australia's cattle industry says the lifting of trade restrictions on US beef imports is unlikely to change much for domestic consumers.\n\nThe federal government has lifted biosecurity restrictions on beef imports from the United States, after a review determined it was safe.\n\nCattle Australia represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers around the country.\n\nIts chief executive Will Evans said America's domestic market relied on Australian beef, which is currently 50 cents cheaper than what the US can produce.\n\n\"The likelihood of them turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said.\n\n\"If I was an exporter of US beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"\n\nLivestock analyst with Global Agri Trends Simon Quilty agreed and said it was unlikely consumers would see US beef in the Australian market.\n\n\"Honestly, if there is a pound of US beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he said.\n\nWhile the blanket ban on US beef was lifted in 2019, restrictions remained in place on Canadian and Mexican cattle slaughtered in America. (ABC News: Brooke Chandler)\n\nTariff talks\n\nThe Trump administration applied a 10 per cent tariff to all Australian products, including beef, in April, citing restrictions on US beef as a major grievance.\n\nMr Quilty said the announcement was good news, as it reduced the risk of the tariff being increased.\n\n\"There were very strong rumours in the market over the last three days [about] two separate [beef] tariffs, one on frozen, one on chilled,\" he said.\n\n\"And the chilled tariffs could [have been] as high as 40 per cent or more, and that the frozen tariff was to be somewhere in the vicinity [of] 20 to 30 per cent.\n\n\"I think that those threats or concerns were genuine and I think that this decision by the government has enabled those threats to go away.\"\n\nThe federal government had been reviewing the trade restrictions. (Unsplash: Jez Timms)\n\nAngus cattle breeder Rodger Pryce hoped the move would stabilise trade with the US market, which he said was currently limited on exports due to record low herd numbers.\n\n\"The chances of us actually importing processed beef products from America, I don't think it's really a reality,\" he said.\n\n\"So by lifting those bans, correspondingly hopefully we will get a more sympathetic ear from America in relation to our beef imports.\n\n\"I don\u2019t see the biosecurity risk as being real but I see the export opportunities for beef for ourselves into America as being very real.\"\n\nRodger Pryce believes it is unlikely Australia will import beef from America. (Supplied: Rodger Pryce)\n\nIn 2024, the US imported 394,716 tonnes of Australian beef.\n\nBy comparison, Australia's total beef imports from all sources were less than 1 per cent of that.\n\nNSW Hunter-based beef producer Robert MacKenzie said he still had some concerns about the biosecurity risk, especially on beef that originated in Canada or Mexico.\n\n\"Even if one piece comes over here and freakishly enough it's contaminated, that could just completely wipe out our herd,\" he said.\n\nHe said Australia's biosecurity should not be compromised in order to further trade negotiations with the US.\n\n\"Our appetite for US beef is not there,\" he said.\n\n\"Why would we take that risk [bringing] it into Australia when clearly we don't want it, just to appease Donald Trump?\"\n\nRobert MacKenzie has concerns about the risk to Australia's biosecurity. (ABC Rural: Amelia Bernasconi)\n\nBiosecurity risks low\n\nFederal Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said the changes would not compromise Australia's biosecurity.\n\nShe said the US had introduced a higher level of traceability this year, allowing cattle to be traced from their farms through their supply chains.\n\nThis allowed more certainty that products were not carrying disease or pests dangerous to Australia.\n\nJulie Collins says the change will not compromise Australia's biosecurity. (ABC News: Lauren Smith)\n\nMr Quilty said the risk to Australia of getting an unwanted disease from US beef trade had been lowered.\n\n\"They have improved their traceability methods within America, and I think in all honesty that the degree of risk really is significantly low,\" he said.\n\nMr Evans said the cattle industry would work with the federal government to manage the risk.\n\n\"We are an enormous global player and on the global scene we are an advocate for rules-based trading systems that are supported by science,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very hard to welcome competitors' product into your market, but the reality is that science has been used to make a technical assessment and that's where we are today.\"",

(Reuters: Henry Nicholls/File)\n\nMike Lynch co-founded software company Autonomy in 1996.\n\nHe was the firm's chief executive and was often hailed as the UK's answer to Bill Gates.\n\nMr Lynch was on the board of the BBC and a technology adviser to former British prime minister David Cameron.\n\nHe became a British success story in 2011 when he sold Autonomy to US technology giant HP, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE).\n\nThat deal is at the heart of the current case.\n\nWhat was his connection to Hewlett-Packard?\n\nHP bought Autonomy for $US11.1 billion ($16.9 billion) as part of its strategy to expand its business software products.\n\nThen-chief executive of HP, Leo Apotheker, said at the time the deal would support HP as it moved towards selling services and products to government agencies and businesses, and away from making smartphones and tablets for consumers.\n\nMr Apotheker was fired before the deal closed.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Mr Lynch would continue to lead Autonomy and its 2,700 employees.\n\nHowever, within a year, and amid staff lay-offs at HP, Mr Lynch left the company.\n\nWhy did Hewlett-Packard and Mike Lynch fall out?\n\nMike Lynch spent nearly a decade in court following the Autonomy-HP fall out Photo shows A man in a suit smiles How Mike Lynch went from celebrating a massive court victory to being caught in a deadly ocean tornado.\n\nThe deal was founded on rocky ground. Autonomy was considered to be overvalued and HP's share prices subsequently tanked.\n\nHP wrote down Autonomy's value by $US8.8 billion within a year of paying $US11.1 billion for it.\n\nIn 2015, HP sought $US5 billion in damages from Mr Lynch and former Autonomy chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain in a UK court. It accused the pair of accounting improprieties and inflating the value of the company.\n\nHP alleged that the pair misrepresented Autonomy's revenue.\n\nMr Lynch always maintained his innocence and blamed HP for failing to integrate Autonomy into the company.\n\nWhat has the court ruled?\n\nThe UK court earlier this week ruled that HP had suffered a loss of nearly 698 million pounds ($1.4 billion) based on the difference between the price it paid and the price it would have paid had Autonomy's \"true financial position been correctly presented\".\n\nIn addition, the court ruled that HP was entitled to another $US47.5 million ($71.9m) for losses suffered by Autonomy group companies relating to hardware sales and other transactions.\n\nThe wreckage of Mike Lynch's yacht, Bayesian, was recovered in June 2025, nearly 10 months after it sank in Italy. (Reuters: Igor Petyx)\n\nBack in 2018, Mr Hussain was found guilty in the US of wire fraud and other crimes related to Autonomy's sale. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nIn 2022, the High Court in London found Mr Lynch and Mr Hussain liable for fraud. While it ruled in HP's favour, a judge said the company would receive \"considerably less\" than $US5 billion.\n\nMr Lynch intended to appeal the High Court's 2022 ruling, a process which was on hold pending Tuesday's decision on damages.\n\nHe was extradited to the US in 2023 to face criminal charges, and he was cleared of fraud charges in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, Mr Lynch had prepared a statement on the 2022 ruling that said HP's claim for $5 billion was a \"wild overstatement\", a spokesperson for his family said.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAnother hearing is set down for November, when the court will determine any applications for permission to appeal. It will also consider how to divide the damages to be paid between Mr Lynch's estate and Mr Hussain, with whom HP settled earlier this year.\n\nABC/Reuters/AP",

(ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nAustralian Honey Bee Industry Council chief executive Danny Le Feuvre said beekeepers \"can't catch a break\" after floods in the country's north and drought in the south hammered bee populations.\n\n\"There's been some rain in SA, but where beekeepers make their honey from is from a lot of the native scrub and bush around the country, and it's very slow to react to rainfall,\" Mr Le Feuvre said.\n\n\"Farm-gate honey prices are very low \u2026 so you add other impacts like drought, where they don't make a lot of production for the year, it's really pushing a lot of guys up against the wall.\n\n\"We're seeing beekeepers stepping out of the industry.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of bunkering down to just get through this drought and hopefully come out the other side next year with a better season, but it's really tough at the moment.\"\n\nVarroa threat creates concern\n\nHeading into pollination season, the varroa threat adds to beekeepers' worries.\n\nVarroa destructor was first discovered in Australia in Newcastle in mid-2022 and has slowly spread to areas of Queensland and Victoria.\n\nIt is yet to be detected in SA.\n\nDanny Le Feuvre says it is an extremely challenging time for beekeepers.

        "text": "Retirees Mike and Margie Browne say Queensland's Pioneer Valley Rail Trail has been a reason to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nThey have for the past two years been helping to build a 40-kilometre trail for mountain bikers, walkers and horse riders by connecting disused sugarcane railways west of Mackay.\n\nThe work got harder in January when Mr Browne was diagnosed with lymphoma and the couple had to start visiting a hospital for chemotherapy.\n\n\"It's given us something to think about rather than dealing with anything to do with health,\" Mr Browne said.\n\n\" I've had to rely on other people to do physical things. \"\n\nThe Brownes have been exploring rail trails throughout Australia. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nThe couple joined the volunteer group of about 15 people with the aim of creating a tourist attraction.\n\n\"We want to help get Mackay and Mackay's small communities on the map,\" Ms Browne said.\n\nShe has been by her husband's side to help with the physical and logistical work.\n\nDebris and markers of the route's previous life helped guide the construction team. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nDuring the wet seasons they have travelled around Australia and tested out their bikes on other rail trails.\n\n\"We've been living in our caravan motorhome till now,\" Ms Browne said.\n\n\"We both love to travel, but this [project] has given Mike some time to rest up and I've been able to do stuff that he can't sometimes.\"\n\nThe trail runs close to cane rail lines that are still in use. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nAfter thousands of hours in conversations with cane farmers and hard work battling fences and natural springs, the first section of trail has unofficially opened to the public.\n\n\"Eventually it'll be part of the entire section that will run from the harbour up to Finch Hatton,\" Mr Browne said.\n\nTourism boom\n\nThe total length of the more than 100 rail trails in Australia has grown from 2,100 kilometres in 2014 to 3,180km.\n\nDamian McCrohan says trails are proving to be a tourism drawcard. (Supplied: Damian McCrohan)\n\nThe success of other trails, such as the one in the Boyne Burnett Valley, should act as a model for new routes, according to Rail Trails Australia president Damian McCrohan.\n\n\"They've seen a lot of people specifically going to that region now to ride it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a hotel opened at Many Peaks [population 149], there's cafes setting up along the way to cater for rail trail users.\"\n\nIt took five years and countless conversations with farmers to secure the route. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nThe organisation did not have hard numbers on visitation, but Mr McCrohan said the popularity of some routes close to city centres had pushed totals into the hundreds of thousands.\n\nHe said the challenge for volunteer-run trails was maintaining them.\n\nPioneer Valley is home to nearly 9,000 people. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\n'Just amazing'\n\nThe dream for the Pioneer Valley volunteers is to connect Mackay's city gates to Finch Hatton, 60 kilometres to the west, which is the trailhead for a recently opened series of mountain biking tracks.\n\nAdam Carter bought the Criterion Hotel in Finch Hatton in 2022 and said the community had welcomed the increase in visitors.\n\nAdam Carter bought the hotel after work on the trail got underway. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\n\"The trails that they've built within the mountains behind us here are just amazing,\" he said.\n\n\" It's just a beautiful spot. You've got Finch Hatton Gorge \u2014 there's a lot to offer. \"\n\nThe Brownes intend to keep working on the next stage of the rail trail.\n\nThe first stage of the Finch Hatton mountain bike trails were opened in April 2024. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nMr Browne is optimistic that connecting the existing mountain-bike park in Finch Hatton to the broader valley will see the tourism spend spread.\n\n\"We've seen these small communities [across Australia] just exploding, like Finch Hatton has and will, because of all these people coming to the area,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a natural spin-off.\"",

        "text": "A Hobart City councillor is calling for Aboriginal acknowledgements at official events to take place before proceedings begin, so they are not \"forced on all attendees\".\n\nCouncillor Louise Elliot has likened the Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country traditions to \"religious rituals\", which she said were being forced on people \"against their will\".\n\nCr Elliot has lodged a motion calling for the practices to instead take place before meetings and events officially begin, so those who wish to take part can arrive early.\n\n\"Many community members are completely fed up with being welcomed to their own country and having these beliefs forced on them that they don't subscribe to,\" Cr Elliot said.\n\nAboriginal rights campaigner Nala Mansell, from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC), described Cr Elliot's reasoning as \"exaggerated\" and \"absurd\", but agreed the practice did not need to take place at each meeting.\n\nCouncil clarifies practice is not mandatory\n\nA Hobart City Council spokesperson said there was no formal policy requiring the practice at the start of council meetings or workshops.\n\nHowever, they said the practice had been consistently observed in Hobart since 2015 and was conducted by all Tasmanian councils and all capital city councils.\n\nThe rise of the Acknowledgment of Country Photo shows A young boy wearing a jewish skull cap looks off camera. Only a couple of decades ago the Acknowledgment of Country was mostly seen as a political act. Now it's everywhere from playschool to parliament.\n\n\"The inclusion of an Acknowledgement of Country aligns with \u2026 strategic documents and cultural protocols and comes from many years of engagement and feedback from the Palawa community,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nCr Elliot said while it was not mandatory, that did not accurately reflect her experiences.\n\n\"I chaired a couple of meetings and \u2026 I was told 'no, it [the acknowledgement] couldn't be removed' from the agenda,\" she said.\n\n\"I was left in a predicament where I could either say something I did not believe in or skip over an agenda item.\"\n\nWhen faced with this, Cr Elliot said she updated the acknowledgement to recognise \"each and every Australian\" and, another time, skipped it entirely.\n\nShe did not receive any punishment or reprimand for doing so, though she said some of her colleagues \"definitely raised their eyebrows\".\n\nLouise Elliot says when she skipped an Acknowledgement of Country while chairing a meeting, some of her council colleagues \"definitely raised their eyebrows\". (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nTraditions likened to 'Christian rituals'\n\nCr Elliot argued the concept of Country was a \"spiritual belief\" for the Aboriginal community, and therefore these traditions were like religious rituals.\n\nTasmanian council rejects move to end Welcome to Country Photo shows Two women holding an indigenous Australian flag that is printed with the word 'WELCOME'. A motion calling on a Tasmanian council to dispense with Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country protocols at events has been rejected \u2014 but the \"damage has been done\", the mayor says.\n\n\"It would be highly inappropriate for Christian rituals, whether it's Communion or the throwing of holy water, to happen in a local government setting,\" she said.\n\nMs Mansell, the campaign coordinator for the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and a Palawa woman, said this logic was simply incorrect.\n\n\"It's completely absurd to suggest that acknowledging the fact of Aboriginal history in this state is similar to religious rituals,\" she said.\n\n\"We don't just believe that we owned the land and we don't just believe that our country was invaded \u2014 they are facts.\"\n\nNala Mansell says it's \"absurd\" to suggest that acknowledging Aboriginal history is akin to a religious ritual. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nDespite this, Ms Mansell agreed with the sentiment that the practice could become \"tokenistic\" when repeated at every meeting.\n\n\"I don't see the benefit of offering symbolic gestures at the beginning of meetings because they provide no benefit whatsoever to Aboriginal people,\" she said.\n\nShe said politicians should instead acknowledge Aboriginal people by addressing the issues caused by the dispossession of their land.\n\nMotion to be debated next week\n\nReconciliation Australia previously described the practices as \"simple but profound ceremonies\" that allow Australians to express respect for traditional owners.\n\nAlmost every council in the country, with some exceptions, includes the acknowledgements as part of official council proceedings.\n\nIn May, a Flinders Island councillor put forward a motion to stop the practice at council events, but it failed to get a seconder.\n\nCr Elliot's motion will be debated at the Hobart City Council meeting on Monday.\n\nCr Elliot said the \"composition of the council\" meant she did not expect it to be supported.",

        "text": "As cost-of-living pressures force many shoppers to tighten their purse strings, premium meat options like grass-fed beef are getting harder to sell, and cattle producers are taking note.\n\nAcross Australia they are opting to feed their stock grain rather than relying on pasture, both to meet consumer demand for cheaper meat and protect themselves from drought.\n\nMr Phelps said the shift to grain-fed came from lessons learned during long periods of drought. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nWhile an abundance of grass on western Queensland grazier Josh Phelps's Tambo property might be reassuring right now, he said previous droughts had taught him not to rely on temporary feed.\n\n\"We're really tending towards the grain-based model,\" he said.\n\nInitially his stock graze on pasture across 19,000 hectares before being finished in a feedlot \u2014 a purpose-built facility where cattle are kept in large outdoor pens and fed a consistent diet for up to 120 days.\n\nThe cattle on Mr Phelps property are raised on grass but sent to a feedlot to be finished on grain. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\n\"We've had a run of [good] seasons which we're very grateful for,\" he said.\n\n\"To be honest, it's been a bit of a healing period. Those terrible teens are still front of mind for some people, but I think we came through that and learned a lot of lessons.\n\n\" But we know that it's the land of droughts and flooding rains, and although we've had great seasons it will turn at some stage. \"\n\nHe said the approach not only ensured the animals had a reliable source of food in dry times, but also produced a more consistent animal before being sold to meatworks.\n\n\"It creates a lot more control and a bit of a safety net,\" he said.\n\nBut it was not just drought that pushed the producer in this direction.\n\nJosh Phelps says feeding his cattle grain allows him to produce a more consistent product. (ABC Rural: Carmen Brown)\n\nMr Phelps said increasingly red meat consumers were being lead by price.\n\n\"In the end it comes down to the consumer,\" he said.\n\n\"They're just happy to buy that regular cut from the supermarket which is generally grain-fed.\n\n\" We can go and produce the best meat in the world but we've still got to sell it. \"\n\nThanks to a run of good seasons, Mr Phelps says his stock have had ample feed, but he knows it will not always be as good. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nMoving towards grain\n\nMr Phelps is one example of a trend toward grain-fed beef that is playing out across the country with more cattle in feedlots at the start of 2025 than ever before.\n\nErin Lukey, senior market analyst with Meat and Livestock Australia, said 1.5 million head of cattle were in feedlots in the first quarter of 2025, up 11 per cent on the previous year.\n\n\"The grain sector has grown drastically and consistently, especially in the last five years,\" Ms Lukey said.\n\n\"Nationally we have 90 per cent utilisation, which is how full pens are.\n\n\"Feedlots as a drought mitigation tool has also increased in popularity.\"\n\nThere are 1.5 million head of cattle on feed in Australia, more than ever before. (ABC Landline)\n\nAccording to MLA, which researches and markets Australian beef globally, Queensland feedlots are at 93 per cent capacity and New South Wales are at 91 per cent.\n\nWith feedlots so full, meat processors have limited capacity to take new animals, but Ms Lukey said that would not stop producers making the switch.\n\n\"More grain-fed product is going to flow to the processor,\" she said.\n\n\"Which means we're going to produce more grain-fed beef.\"\n\nErin Lukey says the grain fed sector has grown dramatically in the past five years. (Supplied: Meat and Livestock Australia)\n\nStefan Vogel, general manager of research at Rabobank, said most of the beef on Australian shelves was grain-fed or finished on grain, and consumer habits had a large impact on production.\n\n\"When they [customers] go to supermarkets, they're trying to find ways to save money and increase the value of their basket,\" Mr Vogel said.\n\n\"There's a demand for quality products at a reasonable price.\n\n\"Feedlots play an integral role not only for the local consumer but also for Australia as a reliable supplier of meat in the global market.\"",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In a congested field of rising stars in the Brisbane Lions\u2019 ranks, Jaspa Fletcher seemed to fly under the radar. Yet Dayne Zorko rates him the best player to walk through Brighton Homes Arena each week. Eclipsed by Norm Smith medallist Will Ashcroft and the goal-scoring antics of Kai Lohmann and Logan Morris, Fletcher\u2019s exploits often went unheralded as the club\u2019s budding contingent inspired last year\u2019s premiership triumph. The arrival of Rising Star contender Levi Ashcroft threatened to obscure him even more. Until now. \u201cPotentially,\u201d Will Ashcroft said, when asked if Fletcher\u2019s efforts had gone largely unappreciated beyond the Lions\u2019 walls. \u201cIt\u2019s really important at our footy club that we value the little things and value people who make huge impact and might not get the credit outside of the club. I think he\u2019s starting to get that, and it\u2019s rightfully deserved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand the body of work he\u2019s done from the day we got here, and even training prior to that in the off season before we got drafted. Jaspa Fletcher and Will Ashcroft joined the Lions at the same time as father-son draftees. Credit: Getty Images \u201cTo see the player and person he\u2019s become is a testament to the people around him at the footy club and beyond that, but also himself. \u201cHe\u2019s unbelievably driven.\u201d Hailing from esteemed AFL stock, the son of 200+ game veteran Adrian, Fletcher is long odds to be caught resting on his laurels. Making his mark on the top level as a wingman, Fletcher\u2019s full-time shift to halfback in the injury absences of Jack Payne (knee) and Noah Answerth (Achilles) has coincided with his most consistent season. Before this year, he was yet to register 20 disposals in a game. He has since hit the milestone in 12 of his past 15 encounters, while averaging 2.73 inside 50s and 7.6 marks an outing in that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked on Fox Footy after Brisbane\u2019s win against the Bulldogs why he felt Fletcher was the side\u2019s best player, Zorko spoke of his versatility, while being an \u201celite\u201d figure in each position he has tried his hand at. But even as Fletcher lifted the premiership trophy, he felt a longing for more. Loading His perception of his own game was one of disappointment, adamant he had so much more to offer come the preseason. \u201cI was just trying to put a bit more muscle on my body, I\u2019ve always been small in frame and last year I didn\u2019t have a year I was quite happy with,\u201d Fletcher said, as he announced his contract extension until the end of 2030. \u201cI was super stoked to go out there and hold the cup up, but for me personally I thought I could add a little bit more. \u201cI think I\u2019ve put three or four kilos on, and I feel like I\u2019m heaps stronger now. I studied exercise and nutrition science after school \u2026 and I\u2019ve been testing things since I got to the club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve found a plan and diet that works for me, and hopefully, I\u2019ll continually add to that and see if I can get to another level.\u201d The fruits of that are beginning to show, and fail to suggest a dip in form nears ahead of Saturday\u2019s QClash with the Gold Coast Suns. Fletcher was even \u201chonoured\u201d to be rated a future captain of the club by current leader Lachie Neale, having previously led the Allies Under-18s side. Jaspa Fletcher sought to increase his muscle mass in a bid to become a stronger force in contested play. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images With a true team-first mentality, the 21-year-old insisted that while he grew up as an inside midfielder, he was unfazed about where he landed. That adaptability could be the ticket which delivers Brisbane back-to-back flags, as star halfback Keidean Coleman plots a comeback to the big stage. Coleman, who went within a kick of claiming the Norm Smith Medal in the 2023 grand final, missed all but a quarter of last season with a ruptured ACL, before suffering a quad strain in training after his round 11 return.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The other big \u201cwin\u201d for the US was, Trump claims, the opening of its agricultural markets to US exports, particularly the market for rice, which has historically been extremely politically sensitive in Japan. According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, American farmers will have the same advantage as countries within the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement in selling into the Japanese market. In theory, US companies will be able to sell more cars to Japan. But the Japanese are unlikely to buy what America has to sell. Credit: Yuriko Nakao During the Obama administration, America was going to be a party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose members include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It was Trump, within days of taking office in his first term in January 2017, who withdrew the US from the TPP. America\u2019s farmers could have had the same trade terms with Japan as those countries eight years ago, if not for Trump.\n\nAs for rice, Japan already imports up to 770,000 tonnes a year (the amount is capped to protect its own rice farmers), with the US supplying about 45 per cent of that volume. Yes, the US may be able to sell more and perhaps displace other suppliers, but Japan has reserved the right to decide the additional volume and quality of any extra imports from the US. Loading The bottom line for the trade elements of the deal is that it does lift the tariff rate on Japan\u2019s exports to the US \u2013 US consumers will pay more for Japanese products \u2013 but Japan has negotiated a deal that does only minor damage to its exports and economy in the process while presenting Trump with the ability to trumpet that he has opened up access to its domestic markets even though nothing material is likely to change. Indeed, unless Trump is forced to lower the rates on other countries\u2019 auto and auto parts exports to the US, along with his sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium and copper, the Japanese negotiators have given their key exporters a competitive edge. Trump says there\u2019s never been anything like the deal with Japan. He may be right, even if it appears he doesn\u2019t understand how it might play out in practice.\n\nThere is a very large non-trade element to the deal. Japan has promised, it seems, to invest up to $US550 billion ($830 billion) in the US, at Trump\u2019s direction and with the US allocated 90 per cent of any profits the investments might generate. The White House described the funding as the \u201ccentrepiece\u201d of the agreement with Japan, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying Japan had been awarded the 15 per cent tariff rate \u201cbecause they were willing to provide this innovative financing mechanism\u201d. There are few details available on what is being loosely described as a Japanese sovereign wealth fund dedicated to investing in strategic sectors such as semi-conductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, shipbuilding, critical minerals and energy in the US. The Japanese say the funds will come from their state banks and government agencies and will be in the form of equity, debt and guarantees. That suggests the $US550 billion, if it ever materialises, will be largely loans and loan guarantees for Japanese and US companies investing in projects Trump deems important.\n\nThe detail will matter. Having effectively been extorted into agreeing to provide the funding, they are hardly likely to hand over $US550 billion without conditions and safeguards to someone who has declared bankruptcy four times. Loading They also have China\u2019s precedent to guide them. To end Trump\u2019s 2018-19 trade war, China agreed to buy a massively increased volume of US products. It eventually bought a little more than half what it had agreed to. Japan can slow-walk the handing over of the funds, knowing that, if it stretches the process out, a new administration in 2029 might have different views on trade. The investment agreement \u2013 apparently the brainchild of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as it became clear Japan wasn\u2019t going to accede to Trump\u2019s most aggressive demands for market access \u2013 is a peculiar one if Trump\u2019s aim is, as he has always claimed, to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit.\n\nIf Japan were to actually deliver $US550 billion of new capital inflows to the US, it would increase the trade deficit, not decrease it. It would also probably help push up the value of the US dollar, which has been tumbling, making US exports less competitive in international markets. Did anyone explain that to Trump? Trump says there\u2019s never been anything like the deal with Japan. He may be right, even if it appears he doesn\u2019t understand how it might play out in practice. The deal with Japan provides a benchmark for the European Union, which appears very close to either agreeing to its own deal or walking away and retaliating with punitive tariffs on US imports. It could probably live with a 15 per cent rate and no cap on its auto exports, provided there is nothing in the US demands that relates to its valued-added tax system or its regulation of social media platforms and big technology companies. Once Trump\u2019s August 1 deadline for deals is reached, the larger picture of Trump\u2019s trade wars will be clear, if still quite messy with its range of different tariffs, different rates and side-deals like the Japanese funding.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When Dave Franco read the script of Together, a comedic horror film about a codependent couple whose bodies begin to fuse, he was immediately on board \u2013 and not just for himself. \u201cI was blown away by all of these insane set-pieces that were like nothing I had ever seen before, and I turned to Alison and said I think we should do this one together,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I read the script and was not at all insulted that Dave compared our relationship to that of the characters in the movie,\u201d says Alison Brie, Franco\u2019s partner of 15 years and wife of eight. In truth, she says, she wasn\u2019t at all insulted because she felt they were so different from the characters in the movie. While hiking in the woods near their home, Millie and Tim become trapped in a strange cave that may or may not have mystical properties. Credit: Kismet Adds Franco, \u201cI think if we were struggling as much as they are, we would not have said yes\u201d. Franco plays Tim, a man in his mid-30s who still harbours a fantasy of making it big with his occasionally gigging band. Brie is Millie, a teacher who lands a new job in the country and thinks of it as the gateway to the next chapter in their lives \u2013 the cute house, the small community, the pitter-patter of little feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is, of course, terrified. After a walk in the woods near their new home goes awry, things get truly weird. Strange smells in the house. Sticky substances that seem to emerge whenever they are close to each other. An inability to leave each other\u2019s orbit for very long, or at all. Franco and Brie met at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. It was, she jokes, \u201ca one-night stand that never ended\u201d. Though she felt their relationship was sufficiently different to the film\u2019s couple, Brie also appreciated that \u201cthe meta quality of us being in a long-term relationship would add a lot to the movie. For us as actors, there was a lot of work that we didn\u2019t have to do to have the theme [of codependency] be infused with that history that\u2019s already there.\u201d Writer-director Michael Shanks offers his stars some instruction on set. The movie was made in the Dandenongs and at Docklands Studios Melbourne. Credit: Germain McMicking/Kismet For writer-director Michael Shanks, though, there was nowhere to hide. Tim is, he readily admits, \u201c100 per cent\u201d him \u2013 or at least him as he was in his mid-20s when he first had the idea for what would become Together. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a relationship with my partner for over 16 years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe met at schoolies the week after high school \u2013 a friend\u2019s parents had a little shack an hour out of Melbourne, we went there and drank ourselves into oblivion for a week, and got awfully sunburnt.\u201d They have been together ever since, he continues, \u201cand there was a point where I realised we have all the same friends, we eat the same food, we listen to the same music, we breathe the same air, and I started to freak out. I was realising that, without her, I wasn\u2019t a complete person any more because we\u2019d been growing in the same direction so much that our lives had become intertwined.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just them, either. \u201cMy friendship group is a series of tragic monogamists, most of whom have been together since high school,\u201d Shanks says. \u201cSome of those relationships have thrived, and some you look at and go, \u2018I don\u2019t think you guys are still together because you love each other. I think you\u2019re just used to each other. You\u2019re so intertwined you can\u2019t extricate yourselves\u2019.\u201d When Shanks told his partner, Louey, about his idea, she was taken aback but also understanding. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m a little upset you\u2019re writing this, but it\u2019s a good idea\u2019.\u201d Shanks wrote his first draft of the screenplay in 2019, when he was in his late 20s. The following year, Screen Australia funded a second draft, and in 2021 it funded a third. (Shanks was already on the agency\u2019s radar thanks to his YouTube channel, which had garnered more than 64 million views before going into hiatus; in 2016, the agency backed his self-made Lord of the Rings parody Wizard of Oz.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat timeline has become critically important in recent months, for reasons that Shanks finds painful to discuss. The film was shot in just 21 days in early 2024, with the star American couple setting up house in Melbourne. \u201cWe loved snagging that window seat at Napier Quarter,\u201d says Brie of the cosy Fitzroy wine bar they frequented. \u201cMelbourne makes us feel at home,\u201d adds Franco. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few places we\u2019ve ever shot that we could actually imagine ourselves living in.\u201d Dave Franco and Alison Brie in Together. Credit: Germain McMicking/Kismet For the rest of the year, Shanks did whatever VFX work he could manage himself, though the big set pieces were farmed out to Framestore. \u201dIt was amazing to work with real visual effects people,\u201d he says, somewhat modestly. He worked day and night and at weekends. \u201cAnd that was the way we managed to get it done in time to submit to Sundance.\u201d The film festival is the world\u2019s foremost showcase of indie cinema. Loading \u201cI\u2019ve been a film nerd my whole life, and you dream of going somewhere like Sundance,\u201d Shanks says. \u201cMaking the film was a dream. Getting into Sundance was the next dream.\u201d Park City, Utah, where the festival has been held, is more than 2100 metres above sea level. It\u2019s not uncommon for visitors to contend with altitude sickness \u2013 and Shanks had it bad. He had a virus too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI spent two days leading up to the screening just vomiting, unable to keep food down. The day of the screening, I was in an emergency room and had a drip and oxygen \u2013 it was awful,\u201d he recalls. Somehow, he forced himself into the 2000-seat cinema where he was due to introduce his film. \u201cAnd as soon as I walked into that room, the adrenaline hit.\u201d Only a very small group of people \u2013 producers and editors and a handful of crew \u2013 had yet seen Together. They thought it was \u201cquite good\u201d, but no one knew how it would play to an audience. Brie plays a teacher who is ready for the relationship to move onto the logical next stage. Credit: Germain McMicking/Kismet \u201dMy partner had flown over for it, and my mother had flown over to see a film she was almost certainly going to hate \u2013 it\u2019s sticky and gross, and it has some nasty moments, and she typically doesn\u2019t watch any film that doesn\u2019t star Judi Dench.\u201d Five minutes in, he got his first laugh. After another five minutes, the film\u2019s first scare landed too. \u201cAnd from then, they just reacted exactly the way we always hoped they would.\u201d At the after-party, he was mobbed by well-wishers while Louey was playing dice games with Brie and English actor Dan Stevens. Even his mum liked it \u2026 ish. \u201cShe came up and said, \u2018I thought that was quite good\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

So too is a cosy bowl that promises to warm you from the inside. Thankfully, Melbourne\u2019s restaurants and cafes know how to craft a cosy noodle soup, braise and more. From casual spots built for solo diners craving steaming soup to delicate broth at a hatted restaurant, these nine bowls will help you beat (heck, maybe even enjoy) the chill. Etta\u2019s coconut-curry laksa with lok-lok (skewers for dipping) on the side. Kristoffer Paulsen Laksa Wednesdays, Etta Etta\u2019s head chef, Lorc\u00e1n Kan, has been working on his laksa recipe for most of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a 30-plus ingredient dish, so getting it perfect is sort of endless. I\u2019m a little bit obsessed with it.\u201d This winter, the Malaysian-Irish chef is letting us in on the obsession with a weekly laksa special. The coconut-curry soup base is vegetarian, made with a slow-roasted paste of lemongrass, galangal, shallots, red chillies and more. Kan adds greens from Remy\u2019s Patch and house-made soy milk and egg tofu; on the side are skewers for dipping (known as lok lok in Malaysia). Fried school prawns come included, others (including veg skewers) can be added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n60 Lygon Street, Brunswick East, ettadining.com.au Kikanbo specialises in spicy, mouth-numbing bowls of ramen, with several spice levels to choose. Spicy miso ramen, Kikanbo Melbourne\u2019s newest ramen restaurant to hail from Japan is not for the faint-hearted. The room glows red, oni (Japanese demon) masks glare at you from above, and every bowl that\u2019s served is marked by the strike of a taiko drum. The hellish ambience foreshadows the fire of Kikanbo\u2019s miso ramen, which features a gleaming orange-red broth, slabs of braised pork belly and baby corn. Despite the soup containing peppercorns and tongue-numbing chilli oil, rice-based shinshu miso paste lends a mellow note. Plus, spice levels are adjustable on a scale of zero to oni. 5/260 La Trobe Street, Melbourne, instagram.com/kikanbo_melb\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Beyond the big bowls: Three extra-special ramens to seek out in Melbourne this winter Salmon saikyo-yaki chazuke, Kombu This wholesome Japanese breakfast specialist joined a pocket of popular bakeries and sandwich spots near Queen Victoria Market last year. Its chazuke \u2013 made by pouring tea or, here, dashi over a bowl of rice and toppings \u2013 has quickly gained a following, with eight versions on offer. The bestseller pairs grilled miso-marinated salmon with yuzu-dashi broth, alongside a flurry of toppings like tobiko (flying fish roe), pickled wasabi stem, furikake and more. 10 Dhanga Djeembana Walk, Melbourne, instagram.com/kombu_qvm Burmese House\u2019s mohinga, a seafood noodle soup, is finished with hard-boiled egg and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMohinga, Burmese House Only a handful of spots serve Burmese food in Melbourne. Richmond\u2019s Burmese House has offered curries, pickled tea-leaf salads and more since 1998. Owner Soe Htike Lwin often fields questions about how Myanmar\u2019s food differs from that of its neighbours. His answer? Try it. The national dish of mohinga is a good start. The breakfast noodle soup is traditionally prepared with catfish stock, but this version uses salmon. Toasted rice powder is added for a velvety finish. The broth is served with rice noodles and extras like a chickpea cracker and sliced boiled egg. Chicken coconut noodle dish ohn no khao swe is a standout too. 303 Bridge Road, Richmond, burmesehouserestaurant.com Misty Pot\u2019s kimchi kalguksu (knife-cut noodle soup) topped with braised beef.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimchi kalguksu, Misty Pot Known for its home-style Korean dishes, ranging from garlicky oxtail stews to ginseng chicken soups, Misty Pot has embraced winter by adding bold kimchi kalguksu to the mix. Although the rustic noodle soup is traditionally made with anchovy stock, owner-chef Jun Kwon uses chicken stock layered with well-fermented kimchi. Chewy, knife-cut noodles swim alongside slices of braised beef, hard-boiled egg and seaweed. It\u2019s a true one-pot meal. 35 Dryburgh Street, West Melbourne, instagram.com/mistypot_melbourne Julie sits within a gorgeous, light-filled space at Abbbotsford Convent.

At Sanhe, there are 30 variations, each made with a base that\u2019s slow-cooked for two to three hours before toppings are added. Owners Nikki Ee and Emily Lin have three favourites: the quintessential preserved egg with pork mince; a lighter shiitake mushroom and chicken; and the delicate scallop and fish combo. 185 Victoria Street, West Melbourne, instagram.com/sanhe_congee\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown sugar, apple and spiced cardamom porridge, Juniper This South Melbourne cafe has a knack with humble grains.

        "text": "A casual hospitality worker can expect to have weekend penalty rates of about $40 an hour protected under a bid to prevent take home pay for employees from being shaved.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures to enshrine penalty and overtime rates in law will be introduced in the House of Representatives on Thursday by Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill aims to prevent variations to awards that would result in lower pay for workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be among the first pieces of legislation introduced by Labor in its second term of power following the 3 May federal election.\n\n\n\nWorkers can be entitled to higher pay rates when they are required to work particular hours or days, including weekends, public holidays or irregular hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile rates can vary depending on an employee's specific award or agreement applicable to that industry, common pay rates for workers on a Sunday are double time (200 per cent) or time-and-a-half (150 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nA calculation of rates on the Fair Work Commission's website shows that for a casual hospitality worker, common penalties for a shift on Saturday are $40.85 per hour, while a day's work on Sunday could bring in $47.65 per hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting penalty rates was an Albanese government election pledge.\n\n\n\nMinister Amanda Rishworth says the bill will ensure the wages of about 2.6m workers are protected. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Rishworth said the bill will ensure the wages of about 2.6 million modern award-reliant workers are protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you rely on the modern award safety net and work weekends, public holidays, early mornings or late nights, you deserve to have your wages protected,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Millions of hard-working Australians rely on penalty rates and overtime rates to keep their heads above water, which is why this bill is so critical and should receive the support of both the opposition and the Greens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's planned changes came after peak retail and business groups put forward proposals for large companies to opt out of providing penalty rates for staff in exchange for a raise on base levels of pay.\n\n\n\nOpposition employment spokesman Tim Wilson said the coalition supported penalty rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will work through the legislation to make sure we consult the businesses and those it's going to impact to get the best outcome,\" he told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson said the absence of a regulatory impact statement, which lays out the potential impacts of the proposed changes, meant consultation was even more important to ensure it would be part of the future success of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition also wants to assess how the changes would interact with the Fair Work Commission, which would be required to apply the new rules in addition to the modern awards objective in making its determination.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research has found the nation's $4 trillion superannuation system is failing Indigenous people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe independent research was commissioned by Super Consumers Australia with Mob Strong Debt Help and Impact Economics and Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found they are twice as likely to be unable to access their superannuation, due to systemic barriers including rigid policies, inaccessible customer service and a lack of accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese barriers are things like rigid ID verification, digital-only processes and a lack of cultural understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Price-Busch is the Financial Counsellor at Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network (ICAN).\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's told NITV there's an urgent need for reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Time and time again in our case work we have clients present to access money from - whether it's their own super that's been lost or for a family member who's passed away - and the amount of information required and in a lot of circumstances that's also legal requirements that they need to meet that they simply can't afford even to access smaller amounts of money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says ICAN aims to create ways for First Nations people to navigate the system and engage more confidently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things the report has pushed for is to have a minimum set of customer service standards for super companies and their First Nations clients, I think that will be a great starting point. In addition to that, I think there will need to be better alternatives for things that take into consideration into differences for people that live in those remote communities, whether that is around digital literacy, or even their ability to make a phone call.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Holden is the Senior Solicitor from Mob Strong Debt Help.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's told SBS World News their statistics suggest only 69 per cent of First Nations consumers have a superannuation fund, compared to 87 per cent for their non-First Nations consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for those who do have a super fund, rigid ID verification rules, culturally unsafe customer service and a reliance on digital-only processes means it can take months or even years to access their own money, if they are still alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says they also found First Nations consumers have a typical balance of less than $22,000 compared to $66,000 for non-First Nations consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see generations of First Nations consumers who aren't able to access their own money. This is money that's been held on trust for them during their time of need whether that may be for financial hardship, retirement or to pass on to the next generation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Holden says many are denied access to their own money in retirement, during financial hardship or after the death of a loved one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also calls for adequately resourcing financial counselling and legal support on superannuation issues for First Nations peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any delay that we have prolongs intergenerational trauma that we give our mob and because this is the money that belongs to them, it belongs to them after their hard work over the years and it's supposed to be held in trust for them. It will be completely unreasonable and even unconscionable for super funds to be able to continue to circulate without providing First Nations consumers the help they need to be able to access their money when they need it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis advice to First Nations people would be to visit the government's Money Smart platform online or to speak to a local counsellor.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "According to the latest Domain House Price Report, the price of houses and units in every capital city increased in the three months to June.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report credits the 'upswing' to renewed buyer demand as the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) rate-cutting cycle boosted borrowing power across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain\u2019s chief of research and economics, Dr Nicola Powell, said \"Australia's housing upswing has broadened\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the first time in four years that all capital cities have seen house price growth at the same time. For units, it's the first time in two years.\"\n\n\n\nSydney and Melbourne lead the charge\n\nHouse prices in Sydney and Melbourne have experienced their fastest quarterly growth in years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney\u2019s median house price jumped 2.6 per cent over the June quarter to hit a new record of $1.7 million, its biggest increase in two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Melbourne, median house prices rose 2.3 per cent to reach just over $1 million, marking a three-year high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These results reflect a turnaround in momentum. Melbourne\u2019s recovery puts it on track to reclaim record territory by mid-2026,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices in other capitals also increased.\n\n\n\nCanberra\u2019s median house price rose to a 15-month high, while Hobart's median house price was the highest it has been in more than three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane, Adelaide and Perth hit new record highs, with median house prices in Perth (currently $955,000) expected to reach the $1 million mark later this year.\n\n\n\nUnit prices surge as buyers seek affordability\n\nAs owning a house pushes further out of reach for many, attention is turning to the unit market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Domain report, national unit prices saw the strongest quarterly growth in two years, rising to a new high of $689,588. Units in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth all reached record prices.\n\n\n\n\"Affordability constraints, high interest rates and rising investor activity are turning the spotlight on units. In many markets, they\u2019re now outperforming houses,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDarwin and Canberra led unit price growth this quarter, with median unit prices in Darwin jumping 5.6 per cent to an eight-year high of $388,169. Median unit prices in Canberra increased 4.6 per cent to $610,752 \u2014 their highest value in nearly two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane is experiencing its longest stretch of unit price growth in history, while Adelaide has posted nine straight quarters of price gains.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the comeback?\n\nPowell said a key catalyst has been improved borrowing capacity, which is up around 5 per cent since the start of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the RBA\u2019s shift towards rate cuts has unlocked fresh demand, meeting still-tight listing volumes and pushing prices higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lower interest rates have given buyers more firepower, but we\u2019re still not seeing enough new homes being built,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combination of rising demand and limited supply has intensified competition, particularly in east coast capitals where population growth remains strong.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhile the current upswing has defied expectations, Powell says the path ahead may be less predictable and the RBA\u2019s next move, after its August meeting, will be crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we see another rate cut, it could boost demand further just ahead of the spring selling season,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But regulators are watching investor activity closely; they may step in if things accelerate too quickly.\"\n\n\n\nLonger-term, supply remains the biggest concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"National dwelling completions are expected to stay well below what\u2019s needed to match population growth,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without a meaningful boost in new construction, we\u2019re likely to see continued price pressure \u2014 especially for well-located homes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, buyers and investors are being urged to act quickly, particularly in cities such as Perth, where house prices remain just below the $1 million mark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Value still exists, but it may not last long, this market is shifting, and quickly.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We often refer to as dementia as with a cognitive decline, we talk about memory, but for me it was much more than that. I really found that my concept of self, who I really thought I was as a person, was just completely taken away from me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the voice of Bill Yeates, Alzheimers Disease International's board member with lived experience of the illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers in 2019, when he was 59 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia: it affects your memory and thinking, and can progress to affect daily activities and functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So being diagnosed under the age of 65, you're still working, you still have a young family, you're financially earning an income, you've got dreams, you've got aspirations. And that all coupled together for me, it just destroyed my whole thought on where I was going in my life. That's why I sort of say it was devastating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his diagnosis, Bill searched for programs that would help him manage his disease, but found few services were available.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the medical support he received from doctors, he decided to develop his own framework to help him live well with dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe calls it the 'Tree of Awakening your Positivity'.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt includes setting small, achievable goals around staying physically active, eating well, exercising his body and mind and staying socially engaged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been doing this for nearly five years now. So it's been a long time and I think it's made a massive difference in my life, not just probably me as a person, actually I don't think I'm the same person I was way back in 2019. I actually think I'm a better person, just about my view on life and everything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBill is among 400,000 Australians living with dementia, and with a growing and aging population, this number is expected to double by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Henry Brodaty is the Co-Director of the University of New South Wales\u2019s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an address to the National Press Club in Canberra, he has said that the disease presents both a health and economic crisis for Australia, and a new approach is therefore necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need the slip, slop, slap of brain health - now. And hope for research. Funding for dementia has lagged behind cancer and heart disease, even though it contributes more to disease burden. Research is critical to find the best ways to provide services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centre for Healthy Brain and Ageing published results from the world\u2019s largest online dementia prevention program trial earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program, called 'Maintain Your Brain', studied the impact of personalised online coaching in physical activity, nutrition, cognitive training, and mental health on dementia risk and progression.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found that after three years, those who received this support showed significant improvements in cognitive performance and greater reductions in dementia risk, compared to those who received general health information alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Brodaty says more funding is essential to ensure research like this can translate to new, effective dementia prevention and management programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's now a new paradigm - re-ablement. It's like rehabilitation. It means enabling people with dementia to be able to live positively for many years. I'm not being Pollyanna about this. I know in the later years, that's difficult. But for many years, people can live well and maximise their abilities and enjoy their lives for longer. There are programs that exist, but they're sparse. And funding is lacking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDementia Australia is one organisation working to address gaps in dementia support for vulnerable communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation has launched the second edition of its Diversity Small Grant program, helping community organisations build awareness and understanding of dementia in Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNigel McPaul is Dementia Australia's General Manager of Monitoring, Evaluation and Development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander of People, the dementia prevalence rate among that community are approximately three to five times higher than that of the general Australian population. And at least 28% of people living with dementia in Australia were born in a non-English speaking country. So we recognise there's a need in this group.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says both groups are faced with more barriers to accessing dementia care, prevention and management programs than the general population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And we can say this pretty simply in any language, navigating dementia and aged care support can be complex and often confusing. So when you add on that cultural and language barrier over the top of that, it becomes even more challenging to navigate. One of the other things that we've learned is that the term dementia is often met with stigma in culturally and linguistically diverse communities, which can lead to people living with dementia to feel socially isolated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr McPaul says the experience of social isolation has been shown to worsen the symptoms and progression of cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's one of the reasons he believes community led programs are so important - as a way to build awareness around dementia, learn about risk reduction and management, and nurture community and connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So making sure that's dementia-friendly, that people cannot be afraid to ask questions about dementia. They've got a place to go to speak to someone about those things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Bill, staying socially connected is one of the things that has helped with managing his Alzheimer's the most.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says while his own approach keeps him physically and mentally active, healthy, and connected with friends, lack of services to help people to live well with the disease highlights a significant missed opportunity.\n\n\n\n",

A lot of work is needed to rebuild trust in a system that parents rely on every single day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Education Minister Jason Clare, referring to alleged abuse by 26 year old childcare worker Joshua Dale Brown, who is accused of abusing eight children aged between five months and two years old, with thousands of children possibly exposed to infectious diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government since accelerating its plan to address safety and quality issues in childcare centres.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill would give the Commonwealth powers to cut off childcare subsidy payments to centres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest weapon that the Commonwealth has to wield here is the funding that we provide that enables childcare centers to operate. It's something like $16 billion a year, and that covers about 70% of the cost of running the average child care centre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also expands the Education Department's ability to monitor centres, and enter without notice or a warrant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This gives more power to our officers to be able to do spot checks without a warrant or without the AFP on board.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd would allow details about breaches to be published by the department.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Leader Sussan Ley says the coalition will closely examine the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Nationals Frontbencher Bridget McKenzie says more needs to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is it enough? No, will it fix the problem? No. There is much more to be done in this space, and I we've acted in a bipartisan way. We'll continue to do so, but we do believe that much more urgent action needs to be taken. The education ministers aren't getting together till October, and the Attorneys General aren't getting together till next month. This needs to be solved. Now, get on the blower. Get them up. You can have a teams meeting, but let's get the solutions on the table and enacted so that our children are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting next month will consider proposals like mandating CCTV in centres, establishing a National Educator Register, and mandatory child safety training.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren's commissioner Anne Hollonds says the split responsibilities can make it a challenging issue to address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And it's often the case with all areas of policy to do with children that the responsibilities are divided between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. And what we see is a bit of handballing of responsibility when a negative event occurs, like the really horrendous situation we're dealing with right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commissioner is calling for a single person to hold the final responsibility for child safety in Australia.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Lockdowns, fear, and isolation endured during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic could have lasting impacts on people's cognitive function, according to new research.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists based in the United Kingdom examined brain scans from nearly 1,000 healthy adults to map how their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic years shaped their brains.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors found the brain age \u2014 how old their brain appeared to be compared to their actual age \u2014 of participants rose by an extra 5.5 months, which could lead to accelerated cognitive decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly participants who were infected with COVID-19 between their scans showed a drop in certain cognitive abilities, such as mental flexibility and processing speed.\n\n\n\nWhat else did the study find?\n\nThe study, led by experts at the University of Nottingham, UK, and published in the scientific journal Nature Communications, found stress and isolation can have long-term health impacts on brain function.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad led the study and said the results were surprising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even people who hadn't had COVID-19 showed significant increases in brain ageing rates. It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe changes were most noticeable in older people, men, and those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nDorothee Auer, professor of neuroimaging and senior author of the study, said disadvantaged groups were more likely to be under strain, reminding us that \"brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The pandemic put a strain on people's lives \u2026 we can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat shapes brain health \u2014 and why it matters?\n\nSo, what happens when your brain health is compromised?\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Oscar Murphy, a senior clinical research fellow at Australian medical research group the Bionics Institute, explained how our brain health can change.\n\n\n\n\"Your brain has connections that make sure that all the communication in the brain can pass through easily and different parts of the brain can communicate to one another,\" Murphy told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These links between neurons are really important to make sure that the brain is working properly and if these are interrupted, which can be seen in sort of certain neurogenerative conditions, this is what we might call a decrease in brain age.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said younger people have more connections and a greater amount of grey and white matter in their brains.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we age, our brain's ability to communicate slowly gets worse, which can be accelerated by external factors like stress and anxiety.\n\n\n\n\"One way of viewing Alzheimer's is that it is the end of brain age, where the communication between brain regions breaks down,\" Murphy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ageing brain can lead to issues with memory and cognitive function, but these symptoms can be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The best things for brain health are the things that are also good for your overall health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main things we would say are reducing stress, making sure you've got enough exercise, that you have a healthy diet, and that you have good, proper sleep.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Whether it's your first or fourth cold of the season, many Australians are waking up at the moment with a sniffle, a sore throat or feeling more tired than usual.\n\n\n\n\n\nJune to August is peak flu season in Australia. There are also high rates of COVID-19 circulating, along with other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it's clear when you need to spend the day in bed: you have a fever, aches and pains, and can't think clearly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it's the flu or COVID-19, you'll want to stay away from others and rest and recover.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about if your symptoms are mild? Are you sick enough to take the day off, or should you push through it? And what if you feel pressured to work?\n\n\n\nHere's what to consider.\n\n\n\nAre you likely to spread it?\n\nWhile it may seem like a good idea to continue working, especially when your symptoms are mild, going to work when infectious with a respiratory virus risks infecting your co-workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are in a client-facing role, such as a teacher or a salesperson, you may also infect others, like students or customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe risks may be even greater for those working with vulnerable communities, such as in aged care work, where the consequences can be severe.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom an organisational perspective, you are likely less productive when you are not feeling well.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, whenever possible, avoid going into work when you're feeling unwell.\n\n\n\nShould I work from home?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic normalised working from home.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, more people work from home when they\u2019re unwell, rather than taking sick leave.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome employees join Zoom or Teams meetings out of guilt, not wanting to let their co-workers down.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The male breadwinner is gone. Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nOthers \u2014 and in particular, some men \u2014 feel the need to maintain their performance at work, even if it's at the expense of their health.\n\n\n\n\n\nA downside of powering through is that workers may prolong their illness by not looking after themselves.\n\n\n\nCan you take leave when you need it?\n\nEmployees in Australia can take either paid or unpaid time off when they are unwell.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost full-time employees get 10 days of paid sick leave per year, while part-time employees get the equivalent pro rata.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployers can ask for reasonable evidence from employees to show they are unwell, such as asking for a medical certificate from a pharmacy or GP, or a statutory declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe type of evidence required may differ from organisation to organisation, with some awards and enterprise agreements specifying the type of evidence needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile taking a sick day helps many workers recuperate, a significant proportion of workers engaged in non-standard work arrangements do not receive these benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are, for example, 2.6 million casual employees who don't have access to paid sick leave.\n\n\n\nMany workers, such as casual employees and self-employed people, often don't have much choice about whether or not to take a sick day. Source: Getty / FG Trade Similarly, most self-employed people, such as tradies and gig workers, do not have any paid leave entitlements.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these workers can still take unpaid leave, they are sacrificing income when they call in sick.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch from the Australian Council of Trade Unions has found more than half of insecure workers don't take time off when injured or sick.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a significant proportion of workers in Australia simply cannot afford to call in sick.\n\n\n\nWhy pushing through isn't the answer\n\n'Presenteeism' is the phenomenon of people reporting for work even when they are unwell or not fully functioning, affecting their health and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile exact figures are hard to determine, since most organisations don't systematically track it, estimates suggest 30 to 90 per cent of employees work while sick at least once a year.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Nelli lives with chronic pain. It took her 20 years to find the right help\n\nPeople work while sick for different reasons. Some choose to because they love their job or enjoy the social side of work \u2014 this is called voluntary presenteeism.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut many don't have a real choice, facing financial pressure or job insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's involuntary presenteeism, and it's a much bigger problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch has found industry norms may be shaping the prevalence of 'involuntary presenteeism', with workers in the health and education sectors more likely to feel obligated to work when sick due to 'at work' caring responsibilities.\n\n\n\nWhat can organisations do about it?\n\nLeaders set the tone, especially around health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they role-model healthy behaviour and support time off, it gives others permission to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupportive leaders can help reduce presenteeism, while pressure from demanding leaders can make it worse. Your co-workers matter too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen teams step up and share the load, it creates a culture where people feel safe to take leave.\n\n\n\n\n\nA supportive environment makes wellbeing a shared responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for some workers, leave isn't an option. Fixing this requires policy change across industries and society more broadly, not just inside the workplace.\n\n\n\n",

Whenever you go searching for a box of milk, you don't find it. A box of milk now costs $100, we can\u2019t afford it and it\u2019s not available. The mother can\u2019t breastfeed, there\u2019s no food and drinks, so there is no breastmilk. The baby died of malnutrition, the child had malnutrition and the mother had malnutrition. This is the case for all of Gaza Strip\u2019s children.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Mohammad Abu Selmia is the Director of Al-Shifa Hospital where Yousef was taken.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the baby was one of 15 people who starved to death in the past 24 hours - and he fears that number will likely rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Famine and starvation are now hitting the Gaza Strip hard. The most fragile category of people, who are suffering from malnutrition which is affecting their lives, are children, patients and elderly people - especially child patients whose situation is getting a lot worse because of malnutrition. Until now, we registered more than 86 deaths since the beginning of this crisis. During the past 36 hours, there has been 21 deaths because of malnutrition, and numbers are subject to increase significantly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli military statistics show that since 2023, an average of 146 aid trucks have entered Gaza each day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has previously stated that a minimum of 600 trucks per day are needed to feed everyone in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U-N's World Food Program has declared that in Gaza, the 'hunger crisis has reached new and astonishing levels of desperation'.\n\n\n\n\n\nSitting atop empty water containers, Yasser Saada says people are collapsing from hunger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People started losing the ability to walk, losing the ability to move. Their movement is abnormal because of malnutrition and there are no essential items for food. Bread, the basic and main substance of food, is not present or is barely present in the Gaza Strip, because of the siege and the closure (of borders).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council is one of the largest independent aid organisations in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary General Jan Egeland says supplies are exhausted and even some of his staff on the ground are starving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And of course, there are hundreds of truckloads just for my organisation waiting to get in. That's why we are so angry. Because our job is to help women, children, the innocent survive. And we're not used to people - beyond Assad in Syria, beyond some of the armed groups in the Congo or in Sudan - denying us access. We're not used to a government supported by Western capitals systematically starving entire populations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the United Nations human rights office [[OCHA]] says starvation is not the only risk - it says more than 1,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since May while trying to access aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of OCHA, Ajith Sunghay, says these numbers have been verified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have put out a statement today giving out a certain figure, 1100 plus. We're very certain of the number. This is not a number that is coming from the Ministry of Health, which is usually disputed by the Israelis. So we do our independent gathering of information and that's based on several sources that we have on the ground, and that's reliable. We've worked with them for years now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the recent killings have taken place in the vicinity of U-S-Israeli backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is run by a private U-S contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael says its soldiers do not target civilians, and it rejects the death tolls reported by aid groups and by Gaza's health ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ajith Sunghay says if Israel denies these killings are occurring, they should allow independent investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have to remember the Israeli Defence Force themselves have admitted to have shot on several occasions. So that's one thing that we need to keep in mind. The other point is we have always said it's important to investigate these killings. What the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, then the IDF need to do is to investigate this, not completely dismiss that this is not happening , and that's not true. And finally, when we have such disputes and even broader questions that have come up about this conflict, allow independent media, allow people like you to go into Gaza , what is there to hide?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organisation says the Israeli military has also attacked its staff residence and main warehouse in Deir al-Balah, which is located in an evacuation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesperson Tarik Jasarevic says forces raided the residences of their employees, and male staff were handcuffed, stripped and interrogated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The house where WHO staff is residing has been attacked. Israeli military moved into the premises. They ordered women and children to leave on foot. Then they sort of interrogated, stripped, handcuffed male residents. And one of our staff is still detained. We don't know what are the charges, we demand his release.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military says that its forces came under fire while operating in the vicinity and responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt did not deny raiding the W-H-O facility, but says any of those it deems \u201csuspects\u201d are being treated \u201cin accordance with international law.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Israel, protesters have taken to the streets of Tel Aviv, carrying sacks of flour on their backs and placards showing pictures of emaciated children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protest was organised by the Standing Together Movement, a grassroots organisation that says its goal is to build a new majority within Israeli society that supports peace, equality, and social and environmental justice.\n\n\n\n\n\nShahda Bishara is a member of the group's national leadership, and says the crowds are demanding an end to what they have described as Israel's 'policy of starvation' in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that a lot of Palestinians right now are experiencing starvation and famine due to the policy of the Israeli government not to allow any humanitarian aid to enter to the Gaza Strip. And therefore, we are coming with, as you see, bags of flour to demonstrate our, first of all, our anger against this inhumane policy, as well as to show that there is a majority within the Israeli society, Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as Jewish, that they are strongly against what is happening right now in Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, along with more than 20 of her global counterparts, signed a joint statement calling for an immediate end to what they say is Israel's violence and denial of humanitarian assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States says top envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Europe for talks on a ceasefire and the opening of aid corridors.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational negotiator and fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Studies, Nomi Bar-Yaacov, says leaders in the West are feeling increasing pressure to take action.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "American transgender women will no longer be able to compete in women's events at the Olympics and Paralympics after a recent policy change by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).\n\n\n\n\n\nA new note on the USOPC website regarding the participation of transgender athletes in sports says: \"As of July 21, 2025, please refer to the USOPC athlete safety policy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy update, which follows an executive order by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, was added to the USOPC Athlete Safety Policy on its website as a new subsection entitled \"Additional Requirements\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The USOPC is committed to protecting opportunities for athletes participating in sport,\" the addition reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The USOPC will continue to collaborate with various stakeholders with oversight responsibilities ... to ensure that women have a fair and safe competition environment consistent with Executive Order 14201 [Trump's order] and the Ted Stevens Olympic & Amateur Sports Act.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Transgender athletes banned from international netball under new policy\n\nThe Stevens Act, adopted in 1988, provides a means of handling eligibility disputes for Olympic sports and other amateur events.\n\n\n\nWhat was Trump's executive order?\n\nTrump signed the order in February in a bid to exclude transgender girls and women from female sports , a directive that supporters said will restore fairness, but critics argue infringes on the rights of a tiny minority of athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe executive order instructed the state department to pressure the International Olympic Committee to change its policy, which allows trans athletes to compete under general guidance preventing any athlete from gaining an unfair advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nA memo to Team USA from USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland and president Gene Sykes obtained by US television network ABC News and ESPN made reference to Trump's executive order, saying: \"As a federally chartered organisation, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's executive order threatens to remove federal funds from any school or institution allowing transgender girls to play on girls' teams, claiming that would violate rules giving US women equal sport opportunities.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What do the AIS guidelines on gender mean for athletes and our elite sports?\n\nThe order requires immediate enforcement against institutions that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order is expected to affect only a small number of athletes. The president of the National Collegiate Athletics Association told a Senate panel in December he was aware of fewer than 10 transgender athletes among the 530,000 competing at 1,100 member schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's order also calls for the US government to deny visas for transgender females seeking to compete in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our revised policy emphasises the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women,\" ESPN quoted the USOPC letter to governing bodies as saying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All national governing bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nESPN also said the officials noted the USOPC \"has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials\" in the wake of Trump's executive order.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move comes as Los Angeles awaits a host role for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US-based National Collegiate Athletic Association also altered its policy for transgender athlete participation to limit women's sports competitors to athletes assigned female at birth after Trump's executive order.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In a congested field of rising stars in the Brisbane Lions\u2019 ranks, Jaspa Fletcher seemed to fly under the radar. Yet Dayne Zorko rates him the best player to walk through Brighton Homes Arena each week. Eclipsed by Norm Smith medallist Will Ashcroft and the goal-scoring antics of Kai Lohmann and Logan Morris, Fletcher\u2019s exploits often went unheralded as the club\u2019s budding contingent inspired last year\u2019s premiership triumph. The arrival of Rising Star contender Levi Ashcroft threatened to obscure him even more. Until now. \u201cPotentially,\u201d Will Ashcroft said, when asked if Fletcher\u2019s efforts had gone largely unappreciated beyond the Lions\u2019 walls. \u201cIt\u2019s really important at our footy club that we value the little things and value people who make huge impact and might not get the credit outside of the club. I think he\u2019s starting to get that, and it\u2019s rightfully deserved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand the body of work he\u2019s done from the day we got here, and even training prior to that in the off season before we got drafted. Jaspa Fletcher and Will Ashcroft joined the Lions at the same time as father-son draftees. Credit: Getty Images \u201cTo see the player and person he\u2019s become is a testament to the people around him at the footy club and beyond that, but also himself. \u201cHe\u2019s unbelievably driven.\u201d Hailing from esteemed AFL stock, the son of 200+ game veteran Adrian, Fletcher is long odds to be caught resting on his laurels. Making his mark on the top level as a wingman, Fletcher\u2019s full-time shift to halfback in the injury absences of Jack Payne (knee) and Noah Answerth (Achilles) has coincided with his most consistent season. Before this year, he was yet to register 20 disposals in a game. He has since hit the milestone in 12 of his past 15 encounters, while averaging 2.73 inside 50s and 7.6 marks an outing in that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked on Fox Footy after Brisbane\u2019s win against the Bulldogs why he felt Fletcher was the side\u2019s best player, Zorko spoke of his versatility, while being an \u201celite\u201d figure in each position he has tried his hand at. But even as Fletcher lifted the premiership trophy, he felt a longing for more. Loading His perception of his own game was one of disappointment, adamant he had so much more to offer come the preseason. \u201cI was just trying to put a bit more muscle on my body, I\u2019ve always been small in frame and last year I didn\u2019t have a year I was quite happy with,\u201d Fletcher said, as he announced his contract extension until the end of 2030. \u201cI was super stoked to go out there and hold the cup up, but for me personally I thought I could add a little bit more. \u201cI think I\u2019ve put three or four kilos on, and I feel like I\u2019m heaps stronger now. I studied exercise and nutrition science after school \u2026 and I\u2019ve been testing things since I got to the club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve found a plan and diet that works for me, and hopefully, I\u2019ll continually add to that and see if I can get to another level.\u201d The fruits of that are beginning to show, and fail to suggest a dip in form nears ahead of Saturday\u2019s QClash with the Gold Coast Suns. Fletcher was even \u201chonoured\u201d to be rated a future captain of the club by current leader Lachie Neale, having previously led the Allies Under-18s side. Jaspa Fletcher sought to increase his muscle mass in a bid to become a stronger force in contested play. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images With a true team-first mentality, the 21-year-old insisted that while he grew up as an inside midfielder, he was unfazed about where he landed. That adaptability could be the ticket which delivers Brisbane back-to-back flags, as star halfback Keidean Coleman plots a comeback to the big stage. Coleman, who went within a kick of claiming the Norm Smith Medal in the 2023 grand final, missed all but a quarter of last season with a ruptured ACL, before suffering a quad strain in training after his round 11 return.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The other big \u201cwin\u201d for the US was, Trump claims, the opening of its agricultural markets to US exports, particularly the market for rice, which has historically been extremely politically sensitive in Japan. According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, American farmers will have the same advantage as countries within the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement in selling into the Japanese market. In theory, US companies will be able to sell more cars to Japan. But the Japanese are unlikely to buy what America has to sell. Credit: Yuriko Nakao During the Obama administration, America was going to be a party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose members include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It was Trump, within days of taking office in his first term in January 2017, who withdrew the US from the TPP. America\u2019s farmers could have had the same trade terms with Japan as those countries eight years ago, if not for Trump.\n\nAs for rice, Japan already imports up to 770,000 tonnes a year (the amount is capped to protect its own rice farmers), with the US supplying about 45 per cent of that volume. Yes, the US may be able to sell more and perhaps displace other suppliers, but Japan has reserved the right to decide the additional volume and quality of any extra imports from the US. Loading The bottom line for the trade elements of the deal is that it does lift the tariff rate on Japan\u2019s exports to the US \u2013 US consumers will pay more for Japanese products \u2013 but Japan has negotiated a deal that does only minor damage to its exports and economy in the process while presenting Trump with the ability to trumpet that he has opened up access to its domestic markets even though nothing material is likely to change. Indeed, unless Trump is forced to lower the rates on other countries\u2019 auto and auto parts exports to the US, along with his sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium and copper, the Japanese negotiators have given their key exporters a competitive edge. Trump says there\u2019s never been anything like the deal with Japan. He may be right, even if it appears he doesn\u2019t understand how it might play out in practice.\n\nThere is a very large non-trade element to the deal. Japan has promised, it seems, to invest up to $US550 billion ($830 billion) in the US, at Trump\u2019s direction and with the US allocated 90 per cent of any profits the investments might generate. The White House described the funding as the \u201ccentrepiece\u201d of the agreement with Japan, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying Japan had been awarded the 15 per cent tariff rate \u201cbecause they were willing to provide this innovative financing mechanism\u201d. There are few details available on what is being loosely described as a Japanese sovereign wealth fund dedicated to investing in strategic sectors such as semi-conductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, shipbuilding, critical minerals and energy in the US. The Japanese say the funds will come from their state banks and government agencies and will be in the form of equity, debt and guarantees. That suggests the $US550 billion, if it ever materialises, will be largely loans and loan guarantees for Japanese and US companies investing in projects Trump deems important.\n\nThe detail will matter. Having effectively been extorted into agreeing to provide the funding, they are hardly likely to hand over $US550 billion without conditions and safeguards to someone who has declared bankruptcy four times. Loading They also have China\u2019s precedent to guide them. To end Trump\u2019s 2018-19 trade war, China agreed to buy a massively increased volume of US products. It eventually bought a little more than half what it had agreed to. Japan can slow-walk the handing over of the funds, knowing that, if it stretches the process out, a new administration in 2029 might have different views on trade. The investment agreement \u2013 apparently the brainchild of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as it became clear Japan wasn\u2019t going to accede to Trump\u2019s most aggressive demands for market access \u2013 is a peculiar one if Trump\u2019s aim is, as he has always claimed, to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit.\n\nIf Japan were to actually deliver $US550 billion of new capital inflows to the US, it would increase the trade deficit, not decrease it. It would also probably help push up the value of the US dollar, which has been tumbling, making US exports less competitive in international markets. Did anyone explain that to Trump? Trump says there\u2019s never been anything like the deal with Japan. He may be right, even if it appears he doesn\u2019t understand how it might play out in practice. The deal with Japan provides a benchmark for the European Union, which appears very close to either agreeing to its own deal or walking away and retaliating with punitive tariffs on US imports. It could probably live with a 15 per cent rate and no cap on its auto exports, provided there is nothing in the US demands that relates to its valued-added tax system or its regulation of social media platforms and big technology companies. Once Trump\u2019s August 1 deadline for deals is reached, the larger picture of Trump\u2019s trade wars will be clear, if still quite messy with its range of different tariffs, different rates and side-deals like the Japanese funding.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When Dave Franco read the script of Together, a comedic horror film about a codependent couple whose bodies begin to fuse, he was immediately on board \u2013 and not just for himself. \u201cI was blown away by all of these insane set-pieces that were like nothing I had ever seen before, and I turned to Alison and said I think we should do this one together,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I read the script and was not at all insulted that Dave compared our relationship to that of the characters in the movie,\u201d says Alison Brie, Franco\u2019s partner of 15 years and wife of eight. In truth, she says, she wasn\u2019t at all insulted because she felt they were so different from the characters in the movie. While hiking in the woods near their home, Millie and Tim become trapped in a strange cave that may or may not have mystical properties. Credit: Kismet Adds Franco, \u201cI think if we were struggling as much as they are, we would not have said yes\u201d. Franco plays Tim, a man in his mid-30s who still harbours a fantasy of making it big with his occasionally gigging band. Brie is Millie, a teacher who lands a new job in the country and thinks of it as the gateway to the next chapter in their lives \u2013 the cute house, the small community, the pitter-patter of little feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is, of course, terrified. After a walk in the woods near their new home goes awry, things get truly weird. Strange smells in the house. Sticky substances that seem to emerge whenever they are close to each other. An inability to leave each other\u2019s orbit for very long, or at all. Franco and Brie met at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. It was, she jokes, \u201ca one-night stand that never ended\u201d. Though she felt their relationship was sufficiently different to the film\u2019s couple, Brie also appreciated that \u201cthe meta quality of us being in a long-term relationship would add a lot to the movie. For us as actors, there was a lot of work that we didn\u2019t have to do to have the theme [of codependency] be infused with that history that\u2019s already there.\u201d Writer-director Michael Shanks offers his stars some instruction on set. The movie was made in the Dandenongs and at Docklands Studios Melbourne. Credit: Germain McMicking/Kismet For writer-director Michael Shanks, though, there was nowhere to hide. Tim is, he readily admits, \u201c100 per cent\u201d him \u2013 or at least him as he was in his mid-20s when he first had the idea for what would become Together. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a relationship with my partner for over 16 years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe met at schoolies the week after high school \u2013 a friend\u2019s parents had a little shack an hour out of Melbourne, we went there and drank ourselves into oblivion for a week, and got awfully sunburnt.\u201d They have been together ever since, he continues, \u201cand there was a point where I realised we have all the same friends, we eat the same food, we listen to the same music, we breathe the same air, and I started to freak out. I was realising that, without her, I wasn\u2019t a complete person any more because we\u2019d been growing in the same direction so much that our lives had become intertwined.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just them, either. \u201cMy friendship group is a series of tragic monogamists, most of whom have been together since high school,\u201d Shanks says. \u201cSome of those relationships have thrived, and some you look at and go, \u2018I don\u2019t think you guys are still together because you love each other. I think you\u2019re just used to each other. You\u2019re so intertwined you can\u2019t extricate yourselves\u2019.\u201d When Shanks told his partner, Louey, about his idea, she was taken aback but also understanding. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m a little upset you\u2019re writing this, but it\u2019s a good idea\u2019.\u201d Shanks wrote his first draft of the screenplay in 2019, when he was in his late 20s. The following year, Screen Australia funded a second draft, and in 2021 it funded a third. (Shanks was already on the agency\u2019s radar thanks to his YouTube channel, which had garnered more than 64 million views before going into hiatus; in 2016, the agency backed his self-made Lord of the Rings parody Wizard of Oz.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat timeline has become critically important in recent months, for reasons that Shanks finds painful to discuss. The film was shot in just 21 days in early 2024, with the star American couple setting up house in Melbourne. \u201cWe loved snagging that window seat at Napier Quarter,\u201d says Brie of the cosy Fitzroy wine bar they frequented. \u201cMelbourne makes us feel at home,\u201d adds Franco. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few places we\u2019ve ever shot that we could actually imagine ourselves living in.\u201d Dave Franco and Alison Brie in Together. Credit: Germain McMicking/Kismet For the rest of the year, Shanks did whatever VFX work he could manage himself, though the big set pieces were farmed out to Framestore. \u201dIt was amazing to work with real visual effects people,\u201d he says, somewhat modestly. He worked day and night and at weekends. \u201cAnd that was the way we managed to get it done in time to submit to Sundance.\u201d The film festival is the world\u2019s foremost showcase of indie cinema. Loading \u201cI\u2019ve been a film nerd my whole life, and you dream of going somewhere like Sundance,\u201d Shanks says. \u201cMaking the film was a dream. Getting into Sundance was the next dream.\u201d Park City, Utah, where the festival has been held, is more than 2100 metres above sea level. It\u2019s not uncommon for visitors to contend with altitude sickness \u2013 and Shanks had it bad. He had a virus too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI spent two days leading up to the screening just vomiting, unable to keep food down. The day of the screening, I was in an emergency room and had a drip and oxygen \u2013 it was awful,\u201d he recalls. Somehow, he forced himself into the 2000-seat cinema where he was due to introduce his film. \u201cAnd as soon as I walked into that room, the adrenaline hit.\u201d Only a very small group of people \u2013 producers and editors and a handful of crew \u2013 had yet seen Together. They thought it was \u201cquite good\u201d, but no one knew how it would play to an audience. Brie plays a teacher who is ready for the relationship to move onto the logical next stage. Credit: Germain McMicking/Kismet \u201dMy partner had flown over for it, and my mother had flown over to see a film she was almost certainly going to hate \u2013 it\u2019s sticky and gross, and it has some nasty moments, and she typically doesn\u2019t watch any film that doesn\u2019t star Judi Dench.\u201d Five minutes in, he got his first laugh. After another five minutes, the film\u2019s first scare landed too. \u201cAnd from then, they just reacted exactly the way we always hoped they would.\u201d At the after-party, he was mobbed by well-wishers while Louey was playing dice games with Brie and English actor Dan Stevens. Even his mum liked it \u2026 ish. \u201cShe came up and said, \u2018I thought that was quite good\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "A post-pandemic surge of international students contributed to rents spiking but was not a major inflation driver, central bank research finds.\n\nLarge swings in foreign student numbers have a particularly strong effect on housing costs, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers said in a paper published on Thursday.\n\nThat's because the market has a limited ability to quickly add new supply to meet rapid increases in demand, due to constraints such as skills shortages and approval delays.\n\nChanging student numbers do affect rents but not nearly by as much as other factors, a report says. (Bianca De Marchi/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe international student population jumped from 357,919 in 2022 to 608,262 at the end of the 2024 financial year, following a drop in enrolments during the pandemic, according to research from conservative think tank the Institute of Public Affairs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRental costs were disproportionately affected because international students are more likely to rent than the general population.\n\nAs a \"back-of-the-envelope\" metric, every 100,000 additional international students in Australia would increase rents by 0.5 per cent compared to the counterfactual, the Reserve Bank of Australia study found.\n\nThat means rents grew about 1.25 per cent faster than they otherwise would have if the international student population had not grown by 250,000 from 2022 to 2024.\n\nThe effect may have been greater than that, given the especially tight rental market during that period, with the vacancy hitting a record low of 0.7 per cent in February 2024, according to Domain.\n\nBut its still a drop in the bucket compared to the overall growth in rents in recent years.\n\nRents have jumped more than 40 per cent in the past five years to reach a national average of $665 per week, according to property research firm Cotality.\n\nA report attributes the price rises to supply factors and strong demand arising from support policy. (Diego Fedele/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe RBA report found the rise in international students likely only accounted for \"a small share of the rise in rents since the onset of the pandemic, with much of the rise in advertised rents occurring before borders were reopened\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The increase in international students was just one of many other forces at play in this time that drove demand above supply in the economy, and hence higher inflation,\" the authors said.\n\n\"For instance, supply-side factors were the biggest driver of the increase in inflation in 2022 and 2023, while strong domestic demand arising from supportive fiscal and monetary policy also played an important role.\"\n\nProspective homebuyers hoping for lower mortgage rates could get a clearer indication of the RBA's next move on Thursday when governor Michele Bullock speaks for the first time since a surprise surge in unemployment data last week.\n\nMs Bullock will talk about the central bank's dual mandate of maintaining low inflation and unemployment in a speech to the Anika Foundation in Sydney.",
