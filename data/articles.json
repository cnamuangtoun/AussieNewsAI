        "text": "With nothing but grit, muscle and an iron jaw, a hugely popular Egyptian wrestler geared up for an extraordinary challenge yesterday: pulling a 700-ton ship across the water with a rope held only by his teeth.\n\n\u201cToday, I have come to break the world record,\u201d Ashraf Mahrous said in an interview in Egypt\u2019s Red Sea resort of Hurghada after the challenge.\n\nIt was no easy task but Ashraf Mahrous, also known by his nickname Kabonga, has dazzled before with his astonishing strength. Earlier this year, he pulled a train. He has also singlehandedly pulled a locomotive and four years ago, a truck.\n\nMahrous in action whilst a Guinness Book of World Records official watches on. (AP)\n\nWith each achievement, his popularity has soared \u2014 children run after him in the streets, where he's known simply as \u201cstrong man.\u201d\n\nWith the ship pull, Mahrous, a 44-year-old native of the port city of Ismalia, hopes to get yet another recognition from the Guinness World Records.\n\nA triumph by the Red Sea\n\nThe scene was set at the shore in Hurghada. Mahrous first pulled a 700-ton ship, and to affirm his challenge he pulled two ships weighing approximately 1150 tons together.\n\n\u201cI pulled them both, thanks to God, to prove to my friends and the whole world that God blessed me by being the strongest man in the world,\u201d Mahrous said.\n\nHe said the current Guinness World Record is a 614-ton ship set in 2018.\n\nMahrous said he will send videos and photos of his attempt to Guinness World Records to be evaluated.\n\nMahrous celebrating his feat. (AP)\n\nIn preparation for the feat, Mahrous followed a protein- and iron-rich diet, consuming at least a dozen eggs, two whole chickens, and 5 kilograms of fish every day \u2014 all while training for two hours, three times a day.\n\nIt wasn't his first ship pull. Six years ago, he tried for two hours before he managed to pull a 4000-ton ship in the water, a rope strapped to his shoulders, for about 30 metres. The event was caught on video.\n\n\u2033I grunted and yelled as I pulled the ship, and I spoke to it, saying \u2018It\u2019s either me or you today,\u2019\" he told The Associated Press recently at his local gym in Cairo, where he trains daily.\n\nMahrous believes that speaking with the object he pulls beforehand helps him establish a connection and is key to his success. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to treat the object that I will pull as part of my body that moves along with my heart beat,\u201d he said.\n\nAn extraordinary child\n\nMahrous, 190 centimetres tall and weighing 155 kilograms, said his strength emerged early.\n\nAs a child, he would carry his friends for fun and haul heavy loads, several gas cylinders at once on a wheelbarrow. He was nine when his father lost his job as a contractor in Iraq and after that, Mahrous began knocking on doors, offering to lift heavy items for some cash.\n\nOnce, he accidentally broke a friend\u2019s arm when he tried to pull him as they played. He helped people move bricks, sandbags and other heavy materials \u2014 and he was fast. He loved sports and trained in kung fu, kickboxing and even established a wrestling team in Cairo.\n\nIt was only when his friends saw him easily flip giant tires 10 times in a row in a deserted courtyard at their gym and push a car using only a finger that they encouraged him to go for a world record.\n\n\u201cI was inspired by people who broke records and felt like they are no better than me,\u201d he said. Now he's less fearful of injuries and more concerned about failing to accomplish a pull.\n\nMahrous was supported by a crowd of people on the shores of the Red Sea. (AP)\n\nPast recognitions\n\nIn March, he was formally recognised by Guinness World Records for the heaviest rail pull: He pulled a train weighing 279 tons with a rope held by his teeth for a distance of nearly 10 metres. At the time, he received two other certificates, for the heaviest locomotive pull and for the fastest 100-metre road vehicle pull.\n\nMahrous, who is also president of the Egyptian Federation for Professional Wrestlers, was previously recognised by Guinness in June 2021, for pulling a 15,730-kilogram truck with his teeth. And in February 2024, the international franchise recognised him for cracking and eating 11 raw eggs in 30 seconds.\n\nHe wears a mouthguard during pulling events but says he has no concerns about his teeth. Instead of going to a dentist, he uses a miswak \u2014 a traditional teeth-cleaning twig rich in anti-bacterial compounds that help prevent decay.\n\nHe says he takes no supplements but eats, sleeps and works out at least twice every day.\n\nHis ambitions are far from over. Next, he plans to send a request to the Egyptian presidency for permission to pull a 263,000-ton submarine.\n\nHe also hopes someday to pull a plane using only his eyelid muscles.",

Pro Wrestling league.\n\nJoining the academy after watching a local show in 2022, Ms Goncalves said the sport was about testing her limits, putting on a show and taking on an alter ego.\n\nDel Goncalves says wrestling has given her a new sense of confidence.

        "text": "The age-old adage is a team of champions will beat a champion team.\n\nOften, we get seduced by the stars of the game, those referred to in mononyms.\n\nThink Buddy, Nat, Danger, Harley, Bont or Trac.\n\nThe Lions have broken the other way.\n\nThey are the complete team, with contributors across the board. For the second straight year, they have come together as more than the sum of their parts to tear a seemingly competitive grand final to shreds.\n\n\"I think in the fullness of time, when you sort of sit back and you think about the quality of team that beat us in this grand final, it might ease the pain a little bit,\" Geelong coach Chris Scott said after the match.\n\nThe 2025 Lions were a slightly different beast to the side from last year. Their centrepiece forward, Joe Daniher, walked off into the sunset after winning his elusive flag.\n\nGeelong's superpower fails its biggest test Photo shows Jeremy Cameron crouched and nursing an arm injury during the Cats' AFL grand final against the Lions. It is the cruel irony of sport that what is usually the ace up Geelong's sleeve proved to be its downfall in the loss to the Brisbane Lions in the season decider.\n\nOne of their most important defenders, Jack Payne, was ruled out early in the year. Their established tall forward, Eric Hipwood, was sidelined on the cusp of finals after playing most of the year with a partially torn ACL.\n\nOther key contributors, such as Jarrod Berry, Lincoln McCarthy, Keidean Coleman and Noah Answerth, missed the biggest game of the year.\n\nThe Lions fielded six players in the 2025 grand final that did not touch the field in last year's triumph over Sydney.\n\nOscar McInerney cruelly missed out on last year's success after dislocating his shoulder the week before. Levi Ashcroft saw his brother be feted across the nation while he waited in the wings at the ground.\n\nAll six \u2014 McInerney, Ashcroft, Bruce Reville, Sam Marshall, Ty Gallop and Darcy Gardiner \u2014 stood up when it mattered most on Saturday.\n\nHow Lions' win unfolded\n\nLike many grand finals, the early going was a slog, a physical test of wills.\n\nThe first six minutes and 30 seconds saw 15 stoppages. Both sides looked unwilling to take risks.\n\nSuggesting it was a cagey start would be an understatement. The Lions wasted some chances on goal early, while the Cats did not make the most of their significant territorial advantage.\n\nOften this type of start is the first step of a classic to come. At half-time everything was level. Not just the scores at 36 apiece, but also the kicks and handballs were dead level.\n\nHowever, the inside 50s and clearances slightly leaned to the Lions.\n\nThere was a clue to what would happen in the match later on.\n\nGeelong was committed to forcing the ball to the wings in the first quarter, actively avoiding the middle of the ground.\n\nThe Cats were throwing defenders on the edges of the corridor, forcing the Lions to either take risks inboard or to safely kick the ball boundary-side. This took much of the pace out of the contest for both sides, and forced it into Geelong's preferred intercept-heavy game.\n\nThis all changed in the second quarter. The Lions took the game on more through the middle and enjoyed some success. This stretched Geelong's defence out and allowed other avenues to goal as the match progressed.\n\nThe Lions only had one disposal in the centre square when transitioning the ball from defence in the first quarter.\n\nThey managed 15 more across the rest of the match, with the balance happening in the second and third quarters. The Cats only used the corridor out of defence once across the match.\n\nBut the pay-off on the scoreboard was not immediate, and the teams went into half-time all locked up, the first time a grand final had been level at half-time since 1909.\n\nSomething entirely different unfolded, though, after the long break.\n\nThe visitors from up north heralded a scoring procession in the second half, one that rivalled the Demons in the 2021 season decider.\n\nThe Lions kicked nine goals to one to set the match alight and crush Geelong's hopes.\n\nThe insertion of inspirational co-captain Lachie Neale also changed the tone of the grand final. Suddenly, the Lions' strong clearance game picked up, leaving the Cats with more questions than answers.\n\nThe Lions won the clearance count by 15 in the second half and made that difference count on the scoreboard as well.\n\nThe Cats outscored the Lions from clearances 108 to 65 in their previous three encounters this season.\n\nThe Lions flipped the script in the grand final, outscoring the Cats 73 to 29 points. With the final margin being 47 points, those 44 hard-won points were the big difference in the match.\n\nWhere in the first half there had been no space to operate for either side, the Lions found plenty. They found targets streaming into space every time they went forward.\n\nCharlie Cameron, deployed in his old role of deepest forward, had a field day with the impeccable supply from those higher up the ground. He finished with four goals, his most productive return since round 10 in 2024.\n\nThe Lions locked the ball in their front half of the ground after half-time, with the game being played on their territory.\n\nThe Cats could not capitalise when they occasionally managed a foray forward, with their attacking worries exacerbated by the injury sustained by Coleman medallist Jeremy Cameron.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield said he heard Cameron's arm crack in the incident.\n\nBy the time the Cats kicked their second goal of the second half, the grand final was all but over.\n\nAshcroft claims second 'Norm'\n\nThere have only been five winners of more than one Norm Smith Medal, with the exclusive club growing on Saturday.\n\nWill Ashcroft joined Andrew McLeod, Gary Ayres, Dustin Martin and Luke Hodge in winning at least two Norm Smith Medals as best on ground in a grand final.\n\nAshcroft, 21, has long been considered one of the best young players in the game. The word \"young\" can now be removed from that description.\n\nThe Queenslander has established himself as one of the finest big-game players of the current era. He is the youngest to win two Norm Smith Medals in the award's storied history.\n\nAshcroft was everywhere in the victory. He managed career-high figures in clearances, inside 50s, tackles and metres gained.\n\nHe not only won the hard ball for the Lions, but also moved it forward dangerously while defending with aplomb.\n\nAshcroft wins Norm Smith Medal Photo shows Will Ashcroft poses with his Norm Smith Medal and AFL premiership medal. Will Ashcroft claims back-to-back Norm Smith Medals after playing a starring role in the Brisbane Lions' grand final win over Geelong.\n\n\"From top to bottom, everyone puts in so much work. We keep turning up and battling through adversity,\" Ashcroft said during the medal presentation.\n\nAshcroft was far from a lone hand for the Lions.\n\nCo-captain Harris Andrews produced one of the finest displays of his career, controlling the match from down back.\n\nHe acted as a one-man aerial defence system, with five intercept marks forcing the Cats to avoid his part of the ground.\n\nHugh McCluggage also had a day out, gaining more territory than he did in any other match this year. The Allansford product kicked four goals while also providing excellent delivery by foot.\n\n'A bitter pill to swallow'\n\nAs ecstatic as the Lions and the city of Brisbane are now, those down the M1 in Geelong will be disappointed.\n\nThe Cats managed to make the grand final, despite the chips being against them at different stages of the season.\n\n\"To be perfectly frank, there were times [this season] where it just seemed unlikely that we would be able to overcome those obstacles to give ourselves a chance today,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Even without those things, I'd still be really proud of the way our club and our players in particular just keep fronting up.\n\n\"(It) Is a bitter pill to swallow because I think we'd shown that our best footy was going to challenge anyone.\"\n\nThe Cats will have the off-season to reflect on their loss to the Lions. (AAP: Joel Carrett)\n\nThe Cats will be there or thereabouts next year, as they always tend to be.\n\nBrisbane's future looks as bright as it did after last year.\n\nThe Lions are expected to have another highly rated Academy product, Daniel Annable, join the club in the draft.\n\nThey are set to add Sam Draper and Oscar Allen to their tall stocks, strengthening their list even further.\n\nBut for now, the focus is on celebrating their hard-earned achievement before looking at doing it again.",

        "text": "Anthony Albanese won't divulge whether he will take an offering to his long-awaited one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump next month, like other world leaders, but flagged that there will be upcoming negotiations over access to Australia's critical minerals stockpiles.\n\nThe government had previously signalled plans to ramp up the mining and processing of the valuable critical minerals, with the hope it could be leveraged to negotiate exemptions from the Trump administration's trade tariffs.\n\nBut on Sunday, the prime minister would not say exactly what Australia's critical minerals offer to the United States included \u2014 nor whether it was exclusive to the Trump administration, after he discussed the issue with his British counterpart.\n\nOther world leaders have gone into their meetings with Mr Trump armed with a significant gesture. British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, for example, went bearing an invitation from the king for a state visit.\n\n\"We will have those negotiations with President Trump in person,\" Mr Albanese told ABC's Insiders on Sunday.\n\nKing Charles and Anthony Albanese during a royal audience engagement at Balmoral Castle. (Supplied: Instagram / @Albomp)\n\n\"Australia has everything that is in demand, almost the entire periodic table, and whether you're looking at lithium, with the reserves that we have, or cobalt, or copper, or vanadium, we have great resources.\"\n\nCritical minerals could end up being part of the AUKUS deal with the US and UK, Mr Albanese said, because the minerals will be required to build defence equipment.\n\n\"One of the things that we want to do is to make sure that we don't just dig things up, our resources, export them, watch someone else value-add, and then import them back at greater prices,\" he said.\n\n\"What we're talking about here is not giving anything to anyone \u2014 even our friends. What we are talking about is making sure that we maximise the return to Australia of that.\"\n\nAfter a \"splendid\" lunch with King Charles at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, Mr Albanese also ruled out holding a referendum to make Australia a republic while he is in office.\n\n\"I have made it clear that I wanted to hold one referendum while I was PM and we did that \u2026 so one referendum the entire time you are prime minister, we did that,\" he said.\n\nAlbanese to sit down with Trump next month\n\nThe prime minister is scheduled to sit down for his first formal meeting with Mr Trump on October 20, after an earlier attempt on the sidelines of the G20 summit fell over when the president departed early amid the conflict with Iran.\n\nThe pair then had a brief catch-up during a function for world leaders in New York last week, with a smiling selfie from the encounter posted to social media.\n\nBut off the back of the meet and greet, Mr Albanese was coy on what would be discussed when he returns to the US.\n\n\"I need to treat him with the respect that the president of the United States deserves, and I expect that to be returned,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump imposes 100 per cent tariff on pharmaceuticals from October 1 Photo shows Prescription medicines The United States will impose a 100 per cent tariff on imports of branded or patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, unless a pharmaceutical company is building a manufacturing plant in the US.\n\n\"And certainly, the indications are \u2014 we've had five either phone conversations or greetings in person now \u2014 and they've all been warm, constructive, positive and optimistic.\"\n\nHe also would not offer his views on Mr Trump's address to the United Nations, in which he urged European nations to follow his lead in cracking down on migration and told leaders, \"your countries are going to hell\".\n\n\"It's not my job to give a critique of other leaders. My job is to govern in Australia's national interest. And part of what we've done is to be strong on borders without being weak on humanity,\" he said.\n\n\"The truth is, that around the world, including in Australia, people want borders to be controlled. They want control over their migration system.\n\n\"That's a way that you build support for migration as well.\"\n\nThe Coalition has accused the prime minister of dropping the ball by failing to meet with the president sooner, and blamed the government for failing to negotiate an exemption to the Trump administration's worldwide trade tariffs.\n\n\"I want to know what Mr Albanese is going to be doing in relation to that, to secure something better for Australians and protect Australian jobs,\" Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Michaelia Cash told Sky News on Sunday.\n\n\"The relationship in Washington is not strong, and because it's not strong, Mr Albanese is not able to pick up the phone, like other world leaders are able to do, and speak directly to the US president about the impact of his announcements on Australia.\"\n\nMr Trump on Thursday announced a 100 per cent tariff on imports of branded or patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, unless a pharmaceutical company is building a manufacturing plant in the US.\n\nPharmaceutical products are one of the top export markets for Australia to the US, worth about $1.6 billion in 2023-24.",

        "text": "On every menu in the town of Kununurra, 3,200 kilometres north of Perth, you will find barramundi, and in every store, you will find fishing supplies.\n\nFishing is the lifeblood of the remote Kimberley town and is put on show every year with the Barra Bash competition.\n\nThe event is Western Australia's largest recreational fishing competition, with more than 1,200 registrations on the first day of this week's event.\n\nDecades of barramundi stocking at Lake Kununurra has led to increased fish sizes. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nKeen anglers have four days to reel in the biggest barramundi across the catchment zone, with last year's winning catch coming in at 1.4 metres.\n\nCompetitors are hoping to trump that, with predictions this year's event could see barramundi exceeding 1.5m.\n\nAs the wet season approaches, temperatures routinely push 40 degrees Celsius, and according to event organiser Aaron Macnamara, the barramundi are biting.\n\n\"The only tip I can say is, you gotta be in it to win it,\" he said.\n\n\" If you don't have your line in the water, you've got no chance. \"\n\nAaron Macnamara says the barramundi are biting. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nWhy such big barra?\n\nWhen part of the upper Ord River was separated into a man-made freshwater reservoir called Lake Kununurra in 1963, fish migration paths were disrupted and fish stocks gradually declined.\n\nA grassroots campaign in the late 1990s and the newly formed Lake Kununurra Fish Stock Enhancement Group drove plans to reintroduce barramundi into the ecosystem, with hopes recreational fishing would benefit the town.\n\nJuvenile barramundi, known as fingerlings, were bred and introduced into the lake, where the rich environment of warm temperatures and an abundance of food aid rapid fish growth.\n\nSome anglers say the East Kimberley is Australia's premier barramundi fishing region. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nOne million juveniles have been introduced into Lake Kununurra in the past decade.\n\nBut the state government cut funding for the fish restocking program in 2023, when Broome's North Regional TAFE aquaculture program and the hatchery which grew the fingerlings shut down.\n\nLake Kununurra Barramundi Restocking Group head Damien Thomas said Lake Kununurra had not been restocked since then, raising concerns about the long-term future of fishing.\n\nDamien Thomas wants to see the restocking program relaunched. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nHe said the remoteness of the area made sustaining the restocking program challenging.\n\n\"The Kimberley's twice the size of Victoria, and there's only 40,000 people here, so it's very remote,\" he said.\n\n\"We're just volunteers \u2014 we don't have the money stick or the bank account, so really the money's got to come through a joint venture through RecFishWest and the state government.\"\n\nSeeking a stocking solution\n\nIn August, seafood giant Tassal launched a new hatchery in Broome, using it to stock its farm north of Derby.\n\nRecFishWest chief executive Andrew Rowland said he had been speaking with Tassal about supporting barramundi restocking at Lake Kununurra.\n\n\"They're [Tassal] not quite ready to scale up to support the program at this point, but have noted they will be likely to have that conversation in the future,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Rowland wants more state government funding for barramundi stocking. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nTassal corporate affairs manager Tom Middleton told the ABC in August that the company would be \"really excited\" to come on board with the program, but that it would require a \"team effort\" from government and stakeholders.\n\nMr Rowland said he had been looking further afield to secure a barramundi supply.\n\n\"We know there's an opportunity to supply barramundi fingerlings out of the Northern Territory, there's a couple of hatcheries there, and we know that the government's gone and had a chat to them, but we are still none too wiser about the results of what's next,\" he said.\n\nWA Fisheries Minister Jackie Jarvis said in a statement the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development would continue to work with RecFishWest and aquaculture bodies to explore ongoing support of the stocking program.\n\nAustralia's Barra-dise?\n\nShire of Wyndham-East Kimberley planning and management director Nick Allen said the East Kimberley was a top fishing destination and the solitude the area offered was like nowhere else.\n\nNick Allen promotes East Kimberley fishing. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\n\"Here you can go out and spend three or four days and not see a single boat or camp on a riverbank and not see anyone,\" he said.\n\n\"The quality of fish on offer here is fantastic.",

        "text": "Far from the hustle and bustle of the daily commute, Australia's luxury rail journeys take a different, more romantic track.\n\nIt is rail to be enjoyed rather than tolerated: savoured for the trip itself rather than endured between one appointment and the next.\n\nSome of these train adventures are living artefacts which transport their passengers back in time as they shuttle from one heritage station to the next.\n\nOthers are the cross-country equivalent of a luxury ocean cruise, complete with fine dining.\n\nThe Great Southern operates across four states. (Supplied: Stephen Whitaker, Trains Camera Action)\n\nSelf-styled rail fan Stephen Whitaker said rail tourism offered a gentle, relaxed and underrated alternative to air travel for those in no particular hurry to get anywhere.\n\n\"I think the idea of train travel stems back to a time when we weren't necessarily rushed to get to places,\" he said.\n\n\"There was more of an adventure in what we were doing.\n\n\"People refer to it as the romantic period of rail when you had steam trains and the idea of going from Melbourne to Cairns, from a time when the world was less connected.\"\n\nStephen Whitaker is self-confessed train fan. (Supplied: Stephen Whitaker)\n\nMr Whitaker said the social aspect of rail travel was sometimes overlooked by travellers who jetted from one place to the next.\n\n\"It's always been a mode of transport that's very social.\n\n\"In part, that's because you can move around. It's harder to move around an aeroplane and impossible in a car or a coach.\n\n\" You add things like dining carriages and lounge cars and it takes it to a whole new level. \"\n\nThe platinum-level sleeping accommodation offered by the Indian Pacific and The Ghan. (Supplied: Journey Beyond Rail)\n\nBlast from the past\n\nMr Whitaker said rail fans, or trainspotters, had an affection for all forms of rail transport, even the humble suburban commuter types.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, my friends and I regularly [ride the commuter network] \u2026 and you can find a level of enjoyment,\" he said.\n\nHowever, rail for pleasure, whether heritage rail or luxury rail, remained his passion and the predominant interest among his network of rail fans.\n\n\"Almost every state has heritage railways.\n\n\"Commonly, they're run by a bunch of volunteers who've managed to acquire an old steam or diesel locomotive from the railways, spend all their time restoring it and then running it for the joy of it.\n\nPart of the appeal of the Pichi Richi Railway is its diverse fleet of locomotives. (Supplied: Kane Stevenson, Kane's Trains)\n\n\"Some of these run on the main lines, but then you have dedicated heritage groups that have their own tracks. Puffing Billy is a perfect example of that where they run 13.5 kilometres of their own track.\"\n\nThen there is the appeal of long-distance rail like The Ghan or the Indian Pacific, both operated by Journey Beyond Rail.\n\nThe Indian Pacific is considered a sister train of The Ghan. (Supplied: Railfan Network)\n\n\"I think there was a period in Australia where railway companies thought they could compete with air travel, and the reality is you can't really have a train going 800 kilometres per hour,\" Mr Whitaker said.\n\n\" If you look at The Ghan or the Indian Pacific, it's a total experience. It's your hotel, it's your restaurant and it's also your mode of travel. \"\n\nNannette Holliday thinks travel is better on a train than a plane \u2014 if you have the time. (Supplied: Nannette Holliday)\n\nFirst-class travel\n\nFreelance international travel writer Nannette Holliday said luxury rail was back in fashion as an alternative to air travel, with most passages booked out well in advance.\n\nShe said Australia's long-distance services were a match for any of the world's great rail journeys.\n\n\"Last year, when I went on the Eastern and Oriental Express when it started up again from Singapore to Malaysia, I compared it with The Ghan,\" Ms Holliday said.\n\n\"The Ghan, the Indian Pacific, the Great Southern: each is a different experience, and you learn about the regions you travel through, not just through the sights and the stops, but also the food and wine you have on board.\n\nLuxury rail services such as The Ghan feature on-board dining. (Supplied: Journey Beyond Rail)\n\n\"If you have a week or so up your sleeve and you want to relax, you are much better off [on a train than a plane].\n\n\"You could be sitting on a train, looking out at the landscape passing by as you are holding a sparkling wine in your hand, chatting to the new friends you have made. It's hard to find anything else like that in Australia.\"\n\nStephen Whitaker's guide to Australia's great railway rides\n\nIndian Pacific\n\nAustralia's longest rail service by distance is the mighty Indian Pacific. (Supplied: Stephen Whitaker, Trains Camera Action)\n\n\"Potentially the most well-known long-distance train in Australia, the Indian Pacific spans the width of Australia, running from Sydney in the east to Perth in the west, with a stop in Adelaide. There's so much to see on this trip, from the run through the Blue Mountains to the wide, open plains of central Australia.\"\n\nThe Ghan\n\nThe Ghan is arguably Australia's most famous train. (Supplied: Kane Stevenson, Kane's Trains)\n\n\"Often thought of as the sister train to the Indian Pacific, The Ghan runs the length of Australia, from Adelaide in the south to Darwin in the north. Running outside the tropical-north wet season, the train is one of contrasts, taking you from the fertile south, through the arid centre, including a stop in Alice Springs, to the tropical north.\"\n\nGreat Southern\n\nThe Great Southern operates between Brisbane and Adelaide. (Supplied: Stephen Whitaker, Trains Camera Action)\n\n\"My favourite train in Australia, by far, is the Great Southern. It only operates over 10 to 12 weeks in summer and is the only passenger train to operate across four states, between Brisbane and Adelaide. This means you'll see all kinds of Australian scenery, from the beaches near Coffs Harbour, the Adelaide Hills and the bright lights of Sydney and Melbourne.\"\n\nPuffing Billy\n\nPuffing Billy Railway was built in 1900 and is a major tourist attraction.

Carrying the spirit of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, get ready to see peak action hero-era Brendan Fraser as a flailing stuntman paired with Bugs and Daffy to save the world from money-grubbing ACME CEO Mr Chairman (Steve Martin at peak silliness). None of it makes a huge amount of sense but that's the beauty of Looney Tunes! Back in Action is a goofy, absurd and wonderfully funny way to spend an afternoon. Trailer Where to watch: iview Paddington & Paddington 2 British actor Ben Whishaw provides the voice for Paddington in the theatrical films. ( ) This is the perfect double feature to keep the family enthralled and happy for at least three hours. Paddington could have been a capitalisation of a beloved brand, but it resulted in a sweet, smart, heartwarming adaptation under the deft guidance of director and co-writer Paul King (also the director behind all of The Mighty Boosh). Then, against all the traditional sequel expectations, King went and one-upped himself with Paddington 2, due to the inclusion of the ultimate cartoon villain and Paddington foil, Phoenix Buchanan (Hugh Grant, in one of his finest performances). For a couple of years, Paddington 2 was the most positively reviewed film on Rotten Tomatoes \u2014 ranking even higher than revered films like Citizen Kane. So really, you're doing yourself and your family a favour by appreciating these modern classics. Trailer Where to watch: iview Gremlins The mogwai of 1984 Christmas horror/comedy Gremlins may look cute... but don't feed them after midnight! ( ) If you have a sprog that's ready to dip their toe into the world of horror, then look no further than this 80s classic. Helmed by legendary director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter 1 & 2), Gremlins sees a dad give his kid a mysterious furry friend for Christmas. Mogwais are cute and cuddly but break one of their rules of care and watch them turn into scaly monsters. With just the right amount of fright to ignite the fire of any young horror lover, you don't have to wait until the festive season to tear into Gremlins.

Timid Laura (Melissa Barrera) is forced to move back to her childhood home following a cancer diagnosis and a brutal, mid-treatment dumping from her dirtbag director boyfriend. Upon her return, she discovers Monster (Tommy Dewey, plastered in prosthetics) is taking up residence in the closet. Instead of devouring her whole, Monster teaches Laura how to harness her anger and their relationship turns romantic. Electrified by Barrera's stand-out performance, Your Monster is the Beauty and the Beast re-telling you never knew you needed. Trailer Where to watch: SBSonDemand Game Night Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams in Game Night ( ) This 2018 gem suffers from bad title syndrome, as Game Night doesn't accurately describe the twisty hijinks that are expertly executed by directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are a couple connected by their love of charades and trivia. Their game night group is thrown into disarray when a treasure hunt created by Max's showboating brother goes awry. There are lots of incredible comedic performances but Jesse Plemons, more recognisable for his dramatic work in films like Alex Garland's Civil War, absolutely runs away with the show as monotonous cop, Gary.

After a donk on the head, Alison (Charlotte Ritchie) is able to see the many ghosts that haunt her recently inherited country mansion \u2014 and the ghosts are just so excited to have someone new to talk to. Created by and starring comedy collective Them There (you might know them as the team behind Horrible Histories), Ghosts is one of the finest ensemble casts of the 21st century, just don't be surprised if you shed a few sentimental tears between the roaring laughter.

When Dawn, nicknamed somewhat sarcastically by her family as Sweetie, returns home, her mother, father and sister's lives are thrown even more into dysfunction as they attempt to placate Sweetie's swinging outbursts. Jane Campion's debut feature sets in motion the New Zealand filmmaker's focus on complex and misunderstood female protagonists. It's thrilling to see Campion's mysterious and sometimes surreal visual taste, which would see her win two Oscars, bubble through in her first stab at a feature film.

Following on from the last year's delightful NITV special, BBQ is expertly helmed by presenter Narelda Jacobs and comedian/poet Steven Oliver who crackle wonderfully together as co-hosts. A revolving door of Australia's best comedians, actors and artists are put to the test on their knowledge on First Nation's history and food in between interactive games. Two teams are captained by Indigenous stars like Shari Sebbens, Dave Woodhead and even Ernie Dingo, allowing for some hilarious back and forth between the hosts and the non-Indigenous contestants. Funny AND educational, what more could you want?

Over 26 episodes, viewers are invited into the high-pressure world of Sports West Academy, an extremely competitive school for the most talented burgeoning athletic stars. The full season is very consumable in a binge-watch format due to the combination of hot people and soap opera-level drama. But the real hook is getting to watch a then-unknown teenage Heath Ledger act his little heart out as country-boy cyclist Snowy Bowles (yes, really), who must grapple with coming out to his teammates. Filmed in and around some of Perth's most recognisable landmarks, Sweat harks back to the golden days of Australian teen melodrama. Trailer Where to watch: Brollie\n\nSurprise me",

        "text": "Unless this is your first day on the internet, you've no doubt noticed Britpop-era icons Oasis are back together, playing their first shows in 16 years.\n\nThe tour has already netted an estimated \u00a3400 million ($815 million) before arriving in Australia in late October.\n\nContemporaries like Blur, Pulp, Suede, and Supergrass have all experienced their own revivals or remained active, but few seem to have captured the current moment quite like Oasis.\n\n\"Biblical\", as the band and their fans would put it.\n\nIt is a successful comeback that has drawn much excitement. But also, derision.\n\nReappraisal of Oasis's legacy has caused some to wonder if they were really all that great to begin with, largely amounting to 'What if The Beatles were football hooligans?'\n\nAn op-ed in The Guardian called them \"the most damaging pop cultural force in recent British history\", blaming the Gallagher brothers' \"knuckle-dragging ideas on sexuality and politics\" for the crime of setting back social attitudes, presaging Brexit and conservative nationalism.\n\nThe Gallagher brothers at the first Oasis reunion concert on Friday, July 4, 2025, in Cardiff. (AP: Scott A Garfitt/Invision )\n\nIndeed, the brothers' droll, foul-mouthed way with words was glamorised by tabloids, earning a reputation as large as their chart-busting songs that helped define the '90s.\n\nOf all the reasons people are so ecstatic about an Oasis reunion, a good number of them can be found on the group's best-selling second album, (What's The Story) Morning Glory?, released 30 years ago this week.\n\nThere is, of course, the inescapable Wonderwall, the epic Champagne Supernova, the swaggering Roll With It, and swooning Don't Look Back In Anger \u2014 an instant classic inspired by a snippet of John Lennon conversation and a nod to his famous solo single.\n\n\"Aren't those two chords the same as Imagine? No shit,\" Noel Gallagher once remarked, engaged in a mock exchange with an imaginary cynic.\n\n\" 'You can't do that!?' I can and I will. And I have. And you'll buy it, so f*** off. \"\n\nLove him or loathe him, he was absolutely right.\n\nA Britpop blockbuster\n\nDespite a muted reaction from the music press, decrying the follow-up to 1994's raw debut Definitely Maybe as generic, laddish, lazy, and \"phoney Beatlemania\", Morning Glory was hugely popular.\n\nIt wasn't just a hit. It was the fastest-selling album in the UK since Michael Jackson's Bad, eventually shifting more than 23 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"There was that moment where \u2026 we were number one in the singles [and] albums charts, consecutively for weeks,\" said Noel Gallagher.\n\n\" That was the kind of shit I dreamt about when I was at school, do you know what I mean? \"\n\nOasis's Noel Gallagher performing live in front of 40,000 fans on April 27, 1996, in Manchester. (Reuters)\n\nThe album spent five weeks atop the Australian charts and has since gone eight-times Platinum, its influence audible in Australian acts ranging from Jet and The Superjesus to DMA'S and Middle Kids.\n\n\"Nobody had any f***ing idea what was going to happen. I wrote the songs; I was more surprised than anyone,\" remarked Gallagher.\n\n\"I've said it many, many times, but if I had known then what I know now about just what Wonderwall would become, or Don't Look Back In Anger, I'd never finish those songs. I'd still be fiddling around with it.\"\n\nIf anything, the guitarist-songwriter was anticipating a poor reception from critics, who chastised the pivot towards beer-y balladry and big, pop-friendly choruses.\n\n\" It didn't get one good review \u2026 We were kind of waiting for that because most people, our record company included, were expecting Definitely Maybe Part Two. \"\n\nThe outcome was an added surprise for British media, who only a few months earlier had fuelled a rivalry between Oasis and Blur, capitalising on 'Cool Britannia' and updating the 'Rolling Stones vs Beatles' chart face-off for the '90s.\n\nDubbed the 'Battle of Britpop', it saw London's artsy, middle-class Blur pitted against Manchester's working-class Gallagher brothers, each releasing singles from their respective upcoming albums on the same day: August 14, 1995.\n\nBlur's Country House would beat Roll With It to number one. Oasis may have lost the battle, but (What's The Story) Morning Glory? won them the war.\n\nBigger and better\n\nDefinitely Maybe introduced Oasis as the most exciting British band of the '90s, a Manchester quintet using rock'n'roll as their ticket out of their ordinary existence.\n\n(What's The Story) Morning Glory? made them massive worldwide. An unapologetic pitch for global domination stocked with stadium-sized anthems with mass appeal that drew on familiar sources.\n\nAs Gallagher noted in a 1996 interview with Rolling Stone:\n\n\" The first album is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band. The second album is about actually being a pop star in a band. \"\n\nMorning Glory has the vitality and attitude of its predecessor, but the gestures are grander, with a wide-screen sonic sensibility that capitalised on Noel Gallagher's blossoming abilities as a songwriter, expanding into more intricate arrangements and surprisingly sensitive territory.\n\nThe melancholy Cast No Shadow features some of his most elegant and vulnerable lyrics, inspired by The Verve's Richard Ashcroft (who opened Oasis's comeback shows in the UK and Ireland) and riffing on chords from Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\n\nThe cello-assisted yearning of Wonderwall and piano-led Don't Look Back In Anger possessed a timeless quality. Sure enough, 30 years on, they're both deathless hits.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBeyond the over-saturated singles, the rest of Morning Glory can still thrill.\n\nThe title track is a reminder that Oasis could rock \u2014 a maelstrom of wailing guitars signalled by a helicopter before Liam Gallagher's delivery of one of the great couplets about cocaine power fantasies ever penned:\n\n\" All your dreams are made/When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade. \"\n\nRoll With It and the whimsical She's Electric are perfect examples of Beatles songs \"played with the attitude of The Rolling Stones and the volume of The Who,\" as ABC writer Matt Neal put it.\n\nMeanwhile, The Jam frontman and Modfather himself, Paul Weller, played harmonica on the stormy Swamp Song instrumental interludes, and searing guitar histrionics on the epic curtain-closer Champagne Supernova.\n\n\"Thank God he did,\" Noel Gallagher reflected. \"It was crying out for a guitar solo because mine was a shocker.\"\n\nHe had held a similarly self-deprecating streak towards his songwriting abilities.\n\n\"Everything that I do is a nod to something or other. I'm not a genius. I'm a fan of music. Paul McCartney's a genius, and Morrissey and Bob Dylan. I'm just fans of theirs.\n\n\" I've got a good knack of putting shit together but I'm not a snob about where it comes from. I'll tell you. Nothing is original, there's only 12 notes anyway. \"\n\nThat self-awareness belies Gallagher's talent for siphoning decades of British rock fanaticism \u2014 from The Kinks through to The Smiths and The Stone Roses \u2014 into a proverbial sonic trifle that was at once familiar but boasted a distinctive flavour.\n\nSibling chemistry\n\nResponding to his elder brother's growth, Liam Gallagher upped the ante on his already commanding vocal sneer.\n\nLiam Gallagher's vocals were \"f***ing on another level on that record,\" his brother Noel remarked in 2020. (Dave Hunt, file photo: AAP)\n\nHis instantly recognisable mix of unimpeachable bravado, charisma and yearning resulted in some of the most memorable rock vocal performances of his, or anyone's career.\n\nEspecially on Wonderwall, its name taken from a lesser-known George Harrison album and originally dedicated to Noel's ex-wife, Meg Matthews.\n\nWho else could bring such conviction and sense of drama to lyrics whose own author was quick to dismiss as meaningless?\n\n\"You know, people have said that to me down the years, 'What does 'slowly walking down the hall faster than a cannonball mean?'\" Noel Gallagher said in his Take 5 with Zan Rowe, illuminating an important comparison between Champagne Supernova and I Am The Walrus by The Beatles.\n\n\"I'm like 'take enough drugs you'll know what it means'. Sitting on a cornflake? Yeah, I've sat on many a cornflake.\"\n\nBeyond the hedonism, Gallagher's songwriting is less about meaning than it is about mood and magnetic simplicity.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nDon't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova \u2014 these songs feel pregnant with importance, even if ultimately, they're apocryphal.\n\nThey gesture at something thoughtful without being profound, which, for better or worse, has proven to resonate with a broad audience.\n\nJust ask the band's resident 'man on the street', Liam Gallagher: the boorish, extroverted yin to Noel's relatively understated yang.\n\nDespite their in-fighting, he clearly relished his elder brother's bar stool philosophy and bulletproof melodies that played to his strength as a vocalist.\n\nRecording a classic\n\nHaving already recorded and released Some Might Say in April 1995 (which topped the charts months before the 'Battle of Britpop'), in May, Oasis decamped to Rockfield Studios, a former dairy farm situated in the Welsh countryside of Monmouth.\n\nThey were booked in for six weeks but ended up finishing the album in less than half that time.\n\n\"We worked hard. I think it was 12 business days,\" Noel Gallagher remembers.\n\nHe'd been boasting to journos as early as Definitely Maybe's release that he'd already written songs for a follow-up. In truth, there was the makings of half an album.\n\nOasis (from left): Liam Gallagher, Paul McGuigan, Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs, Alan White, Noel Gallagher in November 1995 outside Earls Court, London, touring (What's The Story) Morning Glory? (Oasis: Facebook)\n\n\"Half the songs have got a second verse \u2014 they were all written before I got [there]. And the rest of the songs, it's just the first verse twice,\" he recalls. \"That was me getting in here and going 'oh well, f*** it'.\n\n\"You're just working on instinct because you don't second-guess anything when you're young.\"\n\nThat sense of vigour and audacious machismo was all over the album, which reunited the band with producer Owen Morris.\n\n\"In the first five days we'd recorded Roll With It, Hello, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Champagne Supernova,\" he told Q Magazine in 2011.\n\nThe most productive week in Britpop history?\n\nWhy we still love Wonderwall Photo shows Liam Gallagher looks at the camera in a black jacket A quarter century after its release, why does Wonderwall still speak to so many people?\n\nA feat made more remarkable considering the band hit the decks only a week after recruiting drummer Alan White (replacing Tony McCarroll), who swiftly found his place in the group dynamic.\n\n\"I soon cottoned on,\" White told Q Magazine. \"I was the Cockney c**t and they were the Manc f***ers. As a kind of family unit, it felt really good.\"\n\nThe same can't be said for the Gallaghers, whose infamous sibling rivalry inevitably reared its head and temporarily brought sessions to a grinding halt.\n\nWhereas Noel was laser-focused on overcoming difficult second album syndrome, staying up late working on mixes, and nailing the perfect take, Liam would quickly hammer out his vocal takes and become bored.\n\n\"There was loads of pubs in town that we'd heard were good,\" he said in a 2020 Rockfield documentary.\n\n\" It was like 'get in there and f***in' smash it out and then f***in' pub'! \"\n\nThe night that nearly broke Oasis\n\nAfter one particularly heavy drinking excursion, Liam invited a 20-strong entourage \u2014 \"a load of f***ing idiots back from the local village,\" according to Noel \u2014 for a party back at the studio's on-site accommodation.\n\nThat included members of British grunge band Cable, who began winding Liam up. Things turned sour, and drunken fisticuffs ensued, which only escalated once Noel returned from recording to the scene.\n\nLiam remembers his brother's fury: \"'What you doing bringing people back when we're working?!' And I get it but \u2026\n\n\"My argument would be: What are you doing f***ing taking 900 f***ing takes to f***ing do one guitar when you should be in the f***ing pub with me? You know what I mean? Entertaining me?\"\n\nThe ensuing brawl involved air rifles, a cricket bat, a tossed rubbish bin, \u00a3800 in property damage, and Liam shouting obscenities after Noel as White drove him back to London.\n\nThe future of the band, let alone the album, was uncertain.\n\n\"Me and our kid [Noel] had a bit of a scuffle,\" Gallagher junior told Q Magazine in 2011.\n\n\"I went home with a broken arm, broken leg and a shotgun on me shoulder, and me mum goes 'What kind of f***in' music are you making down there!?'\n\nThe brothers didn't show up at the studio the following week.\n\n\"People felt they might not finish the album, for sure,\" Oasis photographer Michael Spencer Jones told BBC. \"It was a serious falling out \u2026 on another level.\"\n\nIt's widely regarded as one of the worst conflicts in a very long list of volcanic Gallagher clashes.\n\nBut that same tension is deeply intertwined with what many consider Oasis's finest musical hour, a toxic chemistry that's, weirdly, also a winning formula.\n\n\"That's the story of the band's life really. It'd sort of be good one minute and then it'd be chaotic the next,\" says Liam.\n\nAfter almost 10 days, and some delicate behind-the-scenes diplomacy, the Gallaghers decided not to look back in anger.\n\nThe band reconvened at Rockfield and finished off recording She's Electric, Cast No Shadow, Hey Now, and Morning Glory.\n\n\"That second session was the best, easiest, least fraught, most happily creative time I've ever had in a recording studio,\" Morris recalled.\n\nNoel Gallagher was \"furious\" when he first saw the cover for (What's The Story) Morning Glory? It was shot in London's Berwick Street. (Oasis: Michael Spencer Jones)\n\nOasis ended up having songs to spare, recording several B-sides that \u2014 in Noel Gallagher's own estimation \u2014 were \"good enough to launch any band's career.\"\n\nAcquiesce, Talk Tonight, Headshrinker, Rockin' Chair, Underneath The Sky, and The Masterplan: all fan favourites that featured on a compilation, also titled The Masterplan, that many consider ranks alongside the first two studio albums as Oasis's best work.\n\nIn retrospect, Gallagher believes it was his most fruitful creative period.\n\n\"The Masterplan' might've been the last of the f***in' great culturally significant songs that I wrote,\" he said in 2020.\n\nLive forever\n\nIn 1996, Oasis headlined two historic concerts at Knebworth, England, to more than 250,000 fans \u2014 some of the biggest concerts in British history.\n\n\" Nothing was ever the same after that,\" remarks Gallagher. \"Then the money came in and all f***ing hell broke loose. \"\n\nBe Here Now, the band's third album, was released in August 1997 to rave reviews (from critics who'd learned to save face after slagging off its predecessor). It became Britain's fastest-selling album ever, but swiftly denounced as a disappointment.\n\nThe long, indulgent \"sound of five men in the studio, on coke, not giving a f***,\" as Noel Gallagher put it in the 2003 Britpop documentary Live Forever.\n\nLoading...\n\nLiam, on the other hand, thought \"it was f***ing great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory.\"\n\nIndeed. Be Here Now was considered rock-bottom because Morning Glory is credited as being Britpop's pinnacle, the barometer by which Oasis was subsequently measured.\n\nTheir 2000s records contained flashes of brilliance but began to sound tired, bloated, and struggling to reach the rarefied heights of their earlier output.\n\nOasis always acted as if they were invincible, but (What's The Story) Morning Glory? marked the point they were legitimately unstoppable.\n\n\"We'd made it, we got to the top of the mountain and we were treated like The Jam and The Beatles,\" reflected Gallagher.\n\nNow, 30 years later, Oasis is enjoying the fairytale rock narrative the Fab Four never got to: the reunion.\n\nAs polarising as the Gallaghers and their graceless public personas could be, the music they made as Oasis possessed a magnetism that brought audiences together.\n\nJust ask the social media users sharing in the opposite of Schadenfreude in seeing the long-feuding Gallaghers seemingly enjoying each other's company on stage again.\n\nWitness the crowds of people singing along word for passionate word. And it isn't just aging Millennials in football jerseys and bucket hats but younger fans belting out classics that have outlived their '90s origins.\n\nIs this collective evidence that Oasis really is the long-touted 'People's Band' after all? Not maybe. Definitely.\n\n\"The people that made [the greatest] records, they're not making them for journalists,\" Noel Gallagher remarked around Morning Glory's 25th anniversary.\n\n\"They're making them for the people, and the people decide what's hot [and] what is not. And that's it, the end.\"\n\nListen to Double J's Classic Albums for more stories behind the best records of all time.",

        "text": "Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan admits he took a punt by naming Lachie Neale as the sub ahead of their stunning win over Geelong in Saturday's grand final.\n\nNeale thought his season was over after injuring his calf in the Lions' qualifying final loss to the Cats earlier this month.\n\nBut 22 days later, the two-time Brownlow medallist was holding a second premiership cup aloft with Lions co-captain Harris Andrews.\n\nThe 32-year-old had an instant impact when he was subbed into the match for teenager Sam Marshall at the start of the third quarter at the MCG.\n\nNeale finished with 17 disposals, seven clearances and one famous goal in a second half that will go down in grand final folklore.\n\n\"I was lying in bed last night thinking, 'I'm either going to look like a total idiot or a total genius,'\" Fagan said after the Lions' 47-point win.\n\n\"If we had lost, and he'd (Neale) only played a half, we'd probably be bemoaning the fact we went about it that way.\n\n\"The bottom line was Lachie was fit to play. But how much game time could he play?\n\n\"Because basically, he'd played one game in 56 days, and coming into a grand final, I was a little bit worried about his ability to see the whole game out if he had to actually start.\"\n\nLachie Neale produced an inspired performance when he came on as the Lions' sub. (Getty Images/AFL Photos: Robert Cianflone)\n\nNeale said he was the \"most nervous\" he had ever been in his career before coming on for the Lions.\n\nHaving been the sub in Fremantle's 2013 grand final loss, Neale had not performed that role since round one in 2014.\n\n\"I haven't done it (play as a substitute) in about 11 years, so I was pretty nervous knowing I was coming on to be the sub in the third,\" Neale said.\n\n\"Probably the most nervous I've ever been just sitting there waiting and knowing if the game was in the balance, they were going to sub me on.\"\n\nThe decision to play Neale, coming in for injured teammate Jarrod Berry, was deemed a major risk because his initial injury assessment had him sidelined for six weeks.\n\nNeale was able to tell Fagan he was right to go at Thursday's main training session, but Berry selflessly made the call to pull out of contention for the grand final.\n\nGeelong's superpower fails its biggest test Photo shows Jeremy Cameron crouched and nursing an arm injury during the Cats' AFL grand final against the Lions. It is the cruel irony of sport that what is usually the ace up Geelong's sleeve proved to be its downfall in the loss to the Brisbane Lions in the season decider.\n\nNeale himself had declared his season over on social media, but now conceded he \"looks like a goose\".\n\nBut the Lions and Neale were always adamant he would be fit to play, and he was confirmed as the surprise sub on Saturday.\n\nHe knew he was going to be right to go after a gruelling running session before the Lions' preliminary final against Collingwood.\n\n\"You hear a bit of the noise and question yourself, but I've got great people around me who told me to delete all the apps off my phone, which I did,\" Neale said.\n\n\"[I decided to] Listen to those close to me and block out the outside noise.\n\n\"I was confident in the calf, it was more about if I could run out the game, full stop.\n\n\"It's a bit of a master stroke, it looks good now. I'm glad I made a bit of an impact.\"\n\nAAP/ABC",

(ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nIt's only taken Bowie a matter of weeks to get back into the water \u2014 at first swimming near the shore before moving to boogie boarding and then surfing.\n\nHe said he was glad to be back, but the shark encounter played on his mind.\n\n\"If it's murky water and there's no-one out, I'm a bit scared,\" he said.\n\n\"If it's clear water and there's a few people out, then I'm fine.\n\n\" Sometimes I'm scared, sometimes I'm not. \"\n\nBowie (right) has been surfing again, including with his friend Ollie. (Supplied: Simon Daly)\n\nBowie said he was thinking more about what could happen when he was surfing, but that being accompanied by friends or family while in the water put him more at ease.\n\nHis father, Simon Daly, said he had noticed changes in his son.\n\n\"If there's no-one in the water, he turns to me and says, 'I'm thinking about it again', and I am too, to be honest,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it will be something that over time will lessen.\"\n\nOne day at a time\n\nMr Daly said his son's attack was a harrowing experience, but their stance on sharing the ocean with sharks had not changed.\n\n\"I've always rested really comfortably with surfing and sharing the same environment as sharks,\" he said.\n\n\"We're out there in the sharks' environment and they're doing their thing, and we're doing our thing.\n\n\"That's why we cohabitate so well.\"\n\nSimon Daly says his views on sharing the ocean with sharks has not changed. (ABC South East: Keira Proust)\n\nNot long after the attack, Bowie set a goal of getting back in the water within a couple of weeks.\n\nHe then became an ambassador for Surfaid's Make a Wave challenge in which he had to surf every day for the month of September.\n\nIt motivated him to get back into the water daily and raise funds to provide clean water and health care to remote surfing villages.\n\n\"It's been a bit hard, but I can do it,\" Bowie said.\n\nBowie Daly has been swimming daily as part of the Make a Wave challenge. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nMr Daly said the challenge \"dovetailed\" with his son's own drive to get back into the surf.\n\n\"Each day, he still definitely has his little battles, which I would as well,\" Mr Daly said.\n\n\"The connection to the ocean is always there for him \u2026 but it is a delicate thing getting back in.\n\n\" This goal of being in the ocean for 30 days is a big part of that. \"\n\nVictim blaming takes toll on animal attack survivors Photo shows A woman sits on a couch against a wall that has many photo frames. News of dangerous animal encounters tend to travel very fast in Australia, but sometimes what follows can compound the mental anguish of survivors.\n\nNot alone\n\nBowie's recovery has not gone unnoticed.\n\nDave Pearson was severely injured in 2011 when he was bitten by a three-metre bull shark during an afternoon surf on the NSW Mid North Coast.\n\nHe founded Bite Club, a group for people who have lived through similar experiences and were looking for support.\n\nYounger surfers who survived shark attacks were usually more resilient than adults when it came to getting back into the water, he said, adding that he admired their strength.\n\n\"They're so great at getting back in,\" Mr Pearson said.\n\n\" I wish we could take some of that youthful innocence or whatever it is from them, and give it back to us oldies a bit because they are so good at it. \"\n\nDave Pearson admires people who get back in the water after an attack. (ABC: Anthony Scully)\n\nMr Pearson said he was still \"spooked\" when he was in the water, and was a \"bit more careful\" before heading out for a surf.\n\nHe said it took time for survivors, as well as their loved ones, to fully recover from a shark attack.\n\nHe recommended surfing with people to mentally cope.\n\n\"It's going to be every time they paddle out, he's going to think about sharks, but they'll get through it.\n\n\"The more people that go out with them, the better it's going to be for him.\n\n\"Make it a massive deal and a massive celebration.\"",

While not the line-up one would have expected at an ECSR gig 20 years ago, the eclectic programming (no doubt the handiwork of music consultant Woody McDonald, formerly of Triple R and Meredith Music Festival) was perfect for the occasion.\n\nLike many fans, my attempts to see this elusive band have been impeded by COVID cancellations and sold-out secret shows. Yet it was worth the decades-long wait to finally see the legendary Melbourne garage-punk outfit in this special setting.\n\nWhile Snoop Dogg\u2019s appearance at the AFL grand final was surely the most talked-about musical performance of this long weekend, a free gig from Eddy Current Suppression Ring (ECSR) at Fed Square was the main event for Melbourne music lovers.\n\nDads danced with their embarrassed kids, leather-jacketed women boogied together, and baffled punters tried to comprehend exactly what the DJ dressed as a wizard was doing with his turntables. As a high-energy flashmob joined him onstage, the atmosphere was joyous.\n\nThen it was time for the headliner. As ECSR singer Brendan Huntley (aka Suppression) donned his iconic black gloves and the band eased into Memory Lane, it felt like we were about to witness something special. Pacing, stagediving and climbing, Huntley worked the crowd like this was an intimate show in a dark band room and not a performance to thousands in the open air. By the time the band launched into Which Way to Go, he had whipped the audience into a frenzy.\n\nEddy Current Suppression Ring are one of Melbourne\u2019s most elusive bands. Credit: Richard Clifford\n\nTo my surprise, the kids, teens and parents remained in the heaving mosh. My neighbour even informed me that the small woman at the barrier having the time of her life was Huntley\u2019s mum. It felt like everyone was family. As the band wound down their generous 70-minute set with the hypnotic Rush to Relax, their deep connection was obvious. The complex mastery of musical repetition is the backbone of ECSR\u2019s deceptively simple songs.\n\nThe quality of Fed Square\u2019s free gigs is changing the game in terms of music accessibility \u2013 this year alone has seen Kneecap, Caribou and Sun Ra Arkestra perform in the space. While there were thousands of die-hard ECSR fans in the audience, I wonder how many people accidentally found themselves watching one of the most beloved bands in Australian music history.\n\nReviewed by Kelsey Oldham",

After a breakout debut NRL season at Parramatta, he has come of age at Penrith, playing in the halves alongside Nathan Cleary at a team attempting to win its fifth consecutive title. It has been a successful shift, but one that also took its toll. The 20-year-old played most of his junior football for the Eels and was promised Clint Gutherson\u2019s No.1 jersey. Deciding to instead accept an offer from arch-rivals Penrith was not a decision he made lightly. \u201cI felt for Blaize going through all that,\u201d Byron said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for him. Not so much the attention, he felt he didn\u2019t want to let Parra down. They gave him an opportunity, putting other people before him. We are blessed to have good people around us to go through the pros and cons. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our own circle and Blaize values everyone\u2019s opinion, but ultimately, it\u2019s his call. He chose to go and learn, which is the best thing for him. At this time in his career, it\u2019s all about learning. He\u2019s at the right place.\u201d There were some challenges to overcome on arriving at the foot of the mountains: a shoulder injury that required surgery resulted in an interrupted off-season, and when the season proper commenced he began it in reserve grade.\n\nLoading It was a step backwards for a youngster who had burst onto the NRL scene while still in his teens. When he eventually got the opportunity to pull on the No.6 jersey that Jarome Luai had made his own, the Panthers were on a losing streak that resulted in them sitting in last spot after 12 rounds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows, but we\u2019re in a good place,\u201d Talagi said. However, the move has been beneficial for all parties, with the Panthers eyeing a sixth consecutive grand final if they can defeat Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday. And of course, there\u2019s the chance to play with and learn from Cleary.",

        "text": "Nearly every job in Australia will be transformed by technological change, with some roles becoming obsolete, new research has found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report by investment bank Barrenjoey found only one in 1,000 Australian jobs will likely remain untouched by technology and artificial intelligence (AI), marking the \"most comprehensive workforce transformation\" in modern history.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnathan McMenamin, head of economic forecasts at Barrenjoey and one of the report's authors, said the numbers were \"incredibly significant\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means that it's very broad base. It's going to affect the way we work right across the workplace,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nSome jobs will change, some will 'fade'\n\nTo examine the role of AI and technology in the workplace, the report analysed their impacts on two areas: skills and tasks that can be substituted by technology and those that can be augmented by it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcMenamin said augmentation was when technology contributed to better outcomes and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report found one in two jobs face \"medium-to-high augmentation\", while one in three face the risk of being replaced by technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means that we are more geared towards augmentation than we are towards substitution,\" McMenamin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think that the threat to the workforce isn't through a mass unemployment phase. This isn't a doomsday piece of research that you might have seen in some other instances, but it's a more balanced outcome that we're expecting for the workforce.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Industries at risk of technology and AI & big dividend day SBS News 21:09 English\n\nThe results align with a federal government report in August, which found generative AI is likely to augment the way we work rather than replace jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile about 30 per cent of the workforce have jobs with high exposure to augmentation, the August report found only 4 per cent of jobs are at risk of being automated by generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Barrenjoey report indicated that nearly 10.9 per cent of the workforce still faces a high risk of replacement, while 22.3 per cent are at medium risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust over seven per cent of the workforce is highly exposed to augmentation, while an additional 38.4 per cent has medium exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What will happen is those substitutable occupations, they will either completely transform in terms of what they look like, or you'll see their role in the workforce just fade over time,\" McMenamin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It won't be an immediate overnight thing, but they will fade.\"\n\n\n\nJobs with the most and least risks\n\nGenerally, labourers, machine operators, sales workers and general clerks are the jobs most at risk of substitution and obsoletion, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research also reveals that consumer staples retail has the highest substitution risk among Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) industries, with more than 125,000 checkout operators and 560,000 sales assistants nationwide still performing tasks that could be automated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial cleaners, sales assistants in broadline retail and specialty stores, kitchen-hands, couriers and postal carriers, truck drivers, and structural steel and welding trades workers are the next groups most at risk.\n\n\n\nThe diversified consumer services sector, which includes jobs such as tax preparation, legal advice, education, and home security, had the lowest substitution rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe life sciences tools and services sector, which includes medical and laboratory scientists, was the next lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also indicated that workers employed by a real estate investment trust generally had less exposure to technology compared to employees in other industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The things that are most substitutable are those things that are very routine. These are tasks and skills that we've been replacing for a long period of time,\" McMenamin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report found the five industries with the highest share of highly substitutable workers were insurance, hotels and restaurants, beverages, consumer staples and food products.\n\n\n\nWhich jobs are going to transform?\n\nOn the other hand, McMenamin says the jobs that are likely to be augmented by technology are \"tasks or areas of the workplace that haven't typically been disrupted by technology in the past\" and often \"cognitive\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now professionals are more exposed to technology, whereas previously it was machine operators and labourers and clerical people, and now it's moving into a newer group,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top five ASX industries that stand out for augmentation potential include:\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\nHealth care technology\n\nSoftware\n\nInteractive media and services\n\nIT services\n\nMcMenamin said the key takeaway from the findings was that workers \"have to adapt\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a general-purpose technology, one that will change the way that we work across the workforce, just like when computers came in or when the internet was invented,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone thinks doomsday, but I think ultimately what we know is that productivity drives increasing living standards.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "When United States President Donald Trump said there was an association between mothers taking Tylenol (paracetamol) and \"a very increased risk of autism\" in children, he added fuel to a fire of mis- and disinformation that has been raging for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, flanked by his health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and TV-physician-turned-healthcare-administrator Mehmet Oz, said taking paracetamol was \"not good\" and suggested without evidence that autism does not appear in communities where it was not widely used.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's comments came just a few months after Kennedy, who is widely considered a vaccine sceptic though has disputed he is \"anti-vaccine\", had vowed to find the \"cause\" of autism by September. That pledge took many by surprise, given that decades of research have not established a singular cause for the neurodevelopmental condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump's comments were met with strong pushback from doctors and other members of the medical community. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday there was no conclusive scientific evidence that confirmed a possible link between autism and the use of paracetamol during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence of a causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and the development of autism or ADHD in children. Source: AAP / AP / Jae C. Hong In Australia, the link was firmly rejected by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and chief medical officer Michael Kidd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the medicines regulator said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Federal Drug Administration guidance that Trump was announcing was also more restrained in its language than that of the US president. It said it was alerting physicians about studies suggesting a correlation between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and subsequent diagnosis of conditions like autism and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it noted that while an association between acetaminophen and neurological disorders had been described in studies, a causal relationship had not been established, and there were contrary studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Whitehouse, the deputy director of research and a professor of autism research at The Kids Research Institute Australia, said Trump's claims were \"at best, a misreading of science\" and \"at worst, a total misuse of science\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are absolutely studies out there that have shown that taking paracetamol during pregnancy is associated with an increased chance of the offspring of that pregnancy and being diagnosed with autism. But there are also studies that show no association, and even studies that show the opposite,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But what not a single one of those studies have shown is any kind of causal link in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE ADHD and autism: Experts urge caution as social media blurs diagnostic boundaries\n\nA major 2024 Swedish study, considered one of the most high-quality on the matter, found no association between use of paracetamol in pregnancy and risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability. The study looked at nearly 2.5 million children born in the country between 1995 and 2019, with nearly 186,000 children exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nWhy are non-evidence-based claims about autism so common?\n\nTrump is far from the first person to push an unproven causal link for autism, a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person's brain develops and functions, and is often characterised by atypical patterns of activities and behaviours and differences in processing and communicating sensory information.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the WHO, people with autism can experience some degree of difficulty with social interaction, and the abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. It said that while some people with autism live independently, others experience severe disability and require lifelong care and support.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, there have been attempts to find a simplistic answer for why some people experience autism, despite the widespread acceptance in the scientific and medical community that a complex, multi-factoral combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1950s gave rise to the since widely discredited 'refrigerator mother' theory: that a lack of warmth from one's parents \u2014 and in particular their mothers \u2014 could explain an autism diagnosis. Such a theory has been largely abandoned since the 1970s, with subsequent studies linking diagnosis to genetics.\n\n\n\nMore recently, anti-vaccine activists have spread disinformation falsely linking autism with vaccination in an attempt to discourage their use, or suggest without evidence that they have a nefarious use.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Trump and Kennedy are among the public figures who have promoted the theory \u2014 contrary to scientific evidence \u2014 that childhood vaccines are a cause of autism. That idea stems from a since-debunked study from British researcher Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s that connected a rise in autism diagnoses with widespread use of the measles vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or medications, or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe causes of autism are still relatively unclear, but there is widespread speculation among scientists that its neurological characteristics may develop in utero.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch suggests genetic factors account for up to 80 per cent of the likelihood of developing autism, and a growing area of investigation focuses on epigenetics \u2014 the interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why does autism appear so susceptible \u2014 perhaps more than any other condition \u2014 to claims about its causes that are not grounded in concrete evidence? Why do some reach for easy answers about a condition that is, in many ways, still a mystery to us?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitehouse says there are two reasons. First is the \"sheer high emotion\" surrounding autism, particularly when it comes to children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a much-wanted, much-loved, much-valued and cherished child. The parents watch that child develop differently, and there's no very simple reason to describe and explain why that has happened,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAndrew Whitehouse said an \"information void\" had allowed non-evidence-based claims and conspiracy theories around autism to flourish. Source: Supplied That provides ample room, Whitehouse said, for people to push misinformation that attributes a single cause for the development of autism \u2014 some well-meaning, others who are \"out-and-out charlatans\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The second reason is because we've allowed it to happen. There is no other area of health and medicine that would allow such low-standard claims to not just exist but flourish without a very strong push against it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But in the area of autism, there historically have not been the high standards of evidence required to make such claims. It's only going to get better if we expect and not only accept higher levels of standard science in the area of autism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitehouse said a lack of proven, simplistic explanation, paired with a generally low standard for evidence, had created an \"information void\" that allowed non-evidence-based claims and conspiracy theories to flourish.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Robson, an honorary professor at the ANU School of Medicine and Psychology, similarly said autism is a condition we still \"don't completely understand\", leading people to try and fill in gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conspiracy theorist looks at the gap and [sees] some mal-intent or something nasty going on,\" he said. \"The researcher sees the gap and says, can I find out what it is? I think that's the fundamental difference.\"\n\n\n\n'Nothing wrong' with being autistic\n\nAmong the rhetoric that surrounds autism and its causes, it's important to keep in mind that autism is not an abstract concept, but a condition that impacts the lives of tens of millions of people around the world, their families and supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's latest remarks recall in some part the 'refrigerator mother' theories of decades ago \u2014 that autism is not a developmental condition but a parental, and specifically maternal, misstep.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat kind of framing is \"inherently sexist\", David Tonge, CEO of support organisation Amaze, told SBS News earlier this week, ahead of Trump's announcement. \"This is an insidious line of discussion that is hurtful to mums,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRobson said Trump's comments had \"amplified\" two layers of stigmatisation: first, the notion that parents of children who had been diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition like autism had \"done something wrong\" in their parenting.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitehouse noted mothers in particular often had \"a whole layer of societal guilt placed around that early developmental phase\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAny attempts to validate that guilt without evidence were \"horrifying\", Whitehouse said, adding that in the days since Trump's comments, he had been contacted by multiple families who were very distressed by the remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other level of stigmatisation that comes with attempts to find a singular reasoning or \"cure\" for autism is the perception that there is anything inherently wrong with being autistic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat notion is one many in the autism community reject: that it is not their condition that is disabling, but the neurotypical societal structures and harmful attitudes that surround them.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Donald Trump walks his own path on autism research. Health experts say claims don't stack up SBS News 05:17 English\n\n\"When you hear the president say, 'I'd fight like hell not to take [paracetamol]', it suggests that autism in itself is a bad thing, and that it's something you have to fight,\" Robson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think for the community of people affected by autism, for those who love them and care for them, this is yet another stigmatisation. You have one of the most powerful people in the world saying that what you have is something that should be fought against, and that is awful for people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian activist Grace Tame, who is autistic, responded to Trump's comments in a video posted to Instagram shortly after they were made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Autism] can't be prevented, augmented or cured, and it doesn't need to be. There's nothing inherently wrong with being autistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a difference in receiving, processing and communicating sensory information that can be disabling depending on external factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whilst we can't change an autistic person, we can change their environment to better support their needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Reuters.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Anthony Albanese has stepped into 10 Downing Street, the UK prime minister's official residence, carrying a six pack of Australian beer after a day of diplomatic talks spanning the rise of far-right populism and global steps towards peace in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dinner was a group event, with Sir Keir Starmer hosting Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon, along with Canadian leader Mark Carney and his wife Diana.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, the three leaders made a joint appearance at a left-wing political conference where they shared the stage, alongside Iceland's Prime Minister, Kristr\u00fan Frostad\u00f3ttir.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer is under intense political pressure in the UK, flagging in the polls and facing the surging popularity of the far-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.\n\n\n\nThe recent election victories by centre-left parties in Australia and Canada were held up as examples to emulate during the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer announced a digital identification card policy at the conference, under which all adults would be required to hold a digital ID should they wish to work in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a bid to address voter concerns about migration, one of Reform UK's major campaign platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know working people are worried about the level of illegal migration into this country. A secure border and controlled migration are reasonable demands, and this government is listening and delivering,\" Starmer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK leader also called for progressive politicians to counter \"lies\" told by populists.\n\n\n\n\"Now is the time for social democrats to confront directly some of the challenges and some of the lies, frankly, that have taken root in our societies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese was asked at his press conference whether Australia's immigration and economic policies were keeping the far right at bay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I'd say is that, in Australia, we have a strong position, and that's been important,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are concerned about elements of the far-right rising in various countries. What our job is to do is to make sure that people continue to have faith in the system. That's something that my government's very focused on.\"\n\n\n\n\"The last election campaign saw one side of politics speak about grievance without putting up any solutions over that period.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I felt that there wasn't any alternative policy work or constructive discussion, and I think they paid a price for that on the third of May .\"\n\n\n\nAlbanese praises Tony Blair amid speculation over Gaza role\n\nAustralia, the UK and Canada are also among a group of Western countries that have recognised Palestinian Statehood during the United Nations leader's week in New York.\n\n\n\nFormer UK Labour leader Tony Blair has been floated as a potential leader of a transitional authority to run Gaza for a number of years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a potential appointment backed by the White House, though yet to be confirmed. But it's drawn some criticism from Arab states because of Blair's history leading the UK into the 2003 Iraq War.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime minister met with Tony Blair in London this morning, where the conflict in the Middle East was raised.\n\n\n\n\"There was an opportunity to be briefed by Mr Blair on some of what he has undertaken and the discussions that he's had. I don't want to pre-empt those processes, but it was an important opportunity to be informed,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tony Blair is someone who's always played a constructive role. He's someone who does look for solutions. He's someone who has been involved in the Middle East issues for some period of time, and I'm sure that he will always play a constructive role, because that's the nature of Tony Blair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese also said he remained confident about the future of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal forged between Australia, the UK and the US.\n\n\n\nThe US Department of War is reviewing the agreement and during the US president's trip to London last week both Starmer and King Charles were publicly backing the agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no indication that I've seen of anything other than support for AUKUS going forward,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is in the interests of all three nations.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Before ECSR hit the stage, local Afro disco duo Wrong Way Up and New York DJ/MC Edan primed the crowd. While not the line-up one would have expected at an ECSR gig 20 years ago, the eclectic programming (no doubt the handiwork of music consultant Woody McDonald, formerly of Triple R and Meredith Music Festival) was perfect for the occasion.\n\nLike many fans, my attempts to see this elusive band have been impeded by COVID cancellations and sold-out secret shows. Yet it was worth the decades-long wait to finally see the legendary Melbourne garage-punk outfit in this special setting.\n\nWhile Snoop Dogg\u2019s appearance at the AFL grand final was surely the most talked-about musical performance of this long weekend, a free gig from Eddy Current Suppression Ring (ECSR) at Fed Square was the main event for Melbourne music lovers.\n\nDads danced with their embarrassed kids, leather-jacketed women boogied together, and baffled punters tried to comprehend exactly what the DJ dressed as a wizard was doing with his turntables. As a high-energy flashmob joined him onstage, the atmosphere was joyous.\n\nThen it was time for the headliner. As ECSR singer Brendan Huntley (aka Suppression) donned his iconic black gloves and the band eased into Memory Lane, it felt like we were about to witness something special. Pacing, stagediving and climbing, Huntley worked the crowd like this was an intimate show in a dark band room and not a performance to thousands in the open air. By the time the band launched into Which Way to Go, he had whipped the audience into a frenzy.\n\nEddy Current Suppression Ring are one of Melbourne\u2019s most elusive bands. Credit: Richard Clifford\n\nTo my surprise, the kids, teens and parents remained in the heaving mosh. My neighbour even informed me that the small woman at the barrier having the time of her life was Huntley\u2019s mum. It felt like everyone was family. As the band wound down their generous 70-minute set with the hypnotic Rush to Relax, their deep connection was obvious. The complex mastery of musical repetition is the backbone of ECSR\u2019s deceptively simple songs.\n\nThe quality of Fed Square\u2019s free gigs is changing the game in terms of music accessibility \u2013 this year alone has seen Kneecap, Caribou and Sun Ra Arkestra perform in the space. While there were thousands of die-hard ECSR fans in the audience, I wonder how many people accidentally found themselves watching one of the most beloved bands in Australian music history.\n\nReviewed by Kelsey Oldham",

I\u2019m just glad that mum knows the kids so much.\u201d\n\nEven Talagi himself, with the benefit of hindsight, can appreciate his good fortune. \u201cThinking back to it, it was a pretty scary time,\u201d Talagi said. \u201cA punctured lung, it\u2019s definitely not to be taken lightly. It was a pretty hard period for me being in hospital for two weeks. Blaize talagi at the Panthers\u2019 academy earlier this week. Credit: KATE GERAGHTY \u201cI got off the field and the doctor there said it was just a stitch. I didn\u2019t want to go to hospital, didn\u2019t want to go to the doctor or anything like that. It just got to a point where it got too bad, and my mum was like, \u2018We\u2019re going.\u2019 I\u2019m lucky we did. \u201cIt was pretty serious, so I\u2019m very grateful that we got it sorted out. I\u2019m glad to move on from that, and I\u2019m feeling good.\u201d\n\nThere is every reason for Talagi to feel good about life at the moment. After a breakout debut NRL season at Parramatta, he has come of age at Penrith, playing in the halves alongside Nathan Cleary at a team attempting to win its fifth consecutive title. It has been a successful shift, but one that also took its toll. The 20-year-old played most of his junior football for the Eels and was promised Clint Gutherson\u2019s No.1 jersey. Deciding to instead accept an offer from arch-rivals Penrith was not a decision he made lightly. \u201cI felt for Blaize going through all that,\u201d Byron said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for him. Not so much the attention, he felt he didn\u2019t want to let Parra down. They gave him an opportunity, putting other people before him. We are blessed to have good people around us to go through the pros and cons. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our own circle and Blaize values everyone\u2019s opinion, but ultimately, it\u2019s his call. He chose to go and learn, which is the best thing for him. At this time in his career, it\u2019s all about learning. He\u2019s at the right place.\u201d There were some challenges to overcome on arriving at the foot of the mountains: a shoulder injury that required surgery resulted in an interrupted off-season, and when the season proper commenced he began it in reserve grade.\n\nLoading It was a step backwards for a youngster who had burst onto the NRL scene while still in his teens. When he eventually got the opportunity to pull on the No.6 jersey that Jarome Luai had made his own, the Panthers were on a losing streak that resulted in them sitting in last spot after 12 rounds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows, but we\u2019re in a good place,\u201d Talagi said. However, the move has been beneficial for all parties, with the Panthers eyeing a sixth consecutive grand final if they can defeat Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday. And of course, there\u2019s the chance to play with and learn from Cleary.",

Picture: Andrew Milligan / Pool / NewsWire\n\nAsked if he thought it \u201cstrange\u201d that he had had to venture to Scotland to \u201cvisit the King of Australia\u201d, Mr Albanese said, \u201cOf course,\u201d adding that King Charles \u201cis fully aware that I support an Australian as our head of state\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I also respect the decisions which have been made and our system of government, and I think that\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the way that I conduct myself, I always support the institutions which are there.\u201d\n\nPressed further on the role of the Royal Family in modern Australia, he said he thought they still held a \u201cgreat deal of respect\u201d in the country.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cTheir majesties, when they visited Australia recently, King Charles and Queen Camilla were very well received,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\n\n\u201cThey work hard.

        "text": "It all started with a 30x40cm veggie patch.\n\nHoping to provide some entertainment for her then six-year-old son, Breanna Parker placed a capsicum plant and a couple of carrots in the \u201cvery, very tiny\u201d structure in the backyard of her suburban Melbourne home during Covid.\n\n\u201cI thought he might get excited to see some veggies grow,\u201d the primary school teacher, who was pregnant and on maternity leave at the time, told Yahoo News Australia on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, in a surprising twist of events, it was the 33-year-old who ended up enjoying playing in the soil the most, igniting a \u201cgreen thumb\u201d that had been passed down in her family for generations. Now, Breanna\u2019s small 400-square-metre block is teeming with vegetables, fruit and native flowers \u2014 appearing like an oasis in the midst of a sea of synthetic turf and concrete.\n\n\u201cI grew up around nature and greenery,\u201d she said, explaining that her grandmother created veggie patches at her country homestead in Victoria, where she also had chickens. Breanna\u2019s mum also \u201cloves\u201d her ornamental garden.\n\n\u201cThe concept of going to nurseries and being around plants has always been in my background,\u201d the teacher told Yahoo, noting that she wasn\u2019t really old enough at the time to appreciate her grandmother\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cNow, I look back and can see and understand the things that she used to do, and I guess try to replicate that in my own very, very tiny way.\u201d\n\nSmall suburban yards can grow a lot of food, Aussie mum says\n\nSeeking \u201cquality food\u201d to feed her growing family, Breanna decided to embrace her newly ignited passion and transform her suburban backyard into an edible garden, and filled the front with an array of native plants, reflecting a growing trend across Australia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI remember people telling me \u2018there\u2019s no space\u2019. I would keep being told you can\u2019t fit that. So I was like well, watch this,\u201d she said, adding she\u2019s always been a \u201cbit of a rule breaker\u201d.\n\nDetermined, the 33-year-old \u201cset out to prove that even tiny gardens can grow a lot of food\u201d. With research, and a lot of trial and error, Breanna\u2019s dream soon became a reality and her backyard is now brimming with seasonal fruits, vegetables and herbs \u2014 all of which are thriving in raised plant beds, pots or grow bags, which help her make the most of the small space.\n\n\u201cI played around a lot with positioning, where different things can and can\u2019t grow, because I found that a lot of labels [on seed packets] don\u2019t reflect what you can really do in a small space,\u201d Breanna said. \u201cA lot of things that might say full sun, which typically people associate with eight to 10 hours of full sun, can actually tolerate less.\u201d\n\nThe transformation has not only brought her joy, but has helped cut down on her family\u2019s grocery bill. Source: Supplied\n\nGardener reveals 'secret weapon' to tiny garden growing\n\nThe mum said one of her \u201clittle secret weapons\u201d is interplanting \u2014 a technique where two or more kinds of plants are grown together to maximise space and soil.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThat is the method of growing I found most successful for a little garden. By intensive interplanting, everything is mixed up, jumbled up and crammed in together, and you\u2019re creating a little mini ecosystem within your garden bed,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cWhen a plant finishes or is harvested, it needs to come out, I then just plug that hole with something else. So I always have things in my garden, it\u2019s never completely blank, start again.\u201d\n\nHer front yard is now a habitat garden for native bugs, critters and birds, which help her control pesky pests across the entire property.\n\n\u201cThe front garden feeds nature and the back garden feeds us,\u201d Breanna, who is now teaching others how to do the same on their residential properties through her new business Tiny Garden Growing, said. Recently, she even consulted with a woman about how to make the most of her balcony.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cOur blocks of land are getting smaller and smaller, and our lives are getting busier and busier, so I think we need to find another way to have people still prioritising their health and the food that they eat,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIt would be amazing to get to a point where we could veggie swap, and then we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on supermarkets as much.\u201d\n\nThe transformation has not only brought her joy, but has helped cut down on her family\u2019s grocery bill, with the mum now checking her yard instead of her pantry before heading to the shops.\n\nBreanna says her native front garden (right) helps keep bugs at bay in her backyard. She has also utilised the strip of land along the side of her house (left). Source: Supplied\n\nBreanna's top tips for growing food in your garden\n\nThe biggest challenge of a suburban garden is sun, not space \u2014 think about where the sun is and how it moves through the garden. Using pots and grow bags not only help you manage small spaces, but also allows you to easily move the plants so they can chase the sun.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPrioritise soil health \u2014 I make sure that my soil is really rich and nutrient dense to begin with. Healthy soil means healthy plants. And then when you intensively interplant everything, it really does look after itself.\n\nIgnore the plant labels \u2014 if you look at the label on a plant that you buy from the shops, it\u2019ll say this broccoli needs 80 centimetres of space. Well, that\u2019s not really practical to somebody who only has one square meter of growing space. The spacing recommendations are there for commercial farming. You don\u2019t need to have things spaced apart so they\u2019re not touching.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
