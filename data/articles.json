        "text": "A $1 billion \"world-leading\" and \"Australian first\" pre-sale finance guarantee policy is hoped to streamline more housing in New South Wales, but how exactly does it work?\n\nTreasurer Daniel Mookhey unveiled the scheme in his third budget this week, targeting the private sector to deliver more housing. \ufeff\n\nThe state will guarantee the pre-sale of up to 5000 apartments or units over five years for residential developments that require a certain number of dwellings to be sold before construction can begin.\n\nA $1 billion \"world-leading\" and \"Australian first\" pre-sale finance guarantee policy is hoped to streamline more housing in New South Wales. (Getty)\n\nThe state claims this \ufeffwill unlock a total of 15,000 new homes.\n\nMookhey said this cuts the red tape around one of the biggest financing bottlenecks for developers - securing enough pre-sales to qualify for funding from banks and lenders.\n\nHe added that this was contributing to the housing crisis by causing months to years-long delays to housing projects. \ufeff\n\n\"These are the projects that will add more low-to-medium density housing in neighbourhoods people love to live in,\" he said.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how exactly the plan will work.\n\nTreasurer Daniel Mookhey during a press conference before handing down the budget this week. (Dominic Lorrimer)\n\nThe state government has approved a $1 billion revolving fund, which will be used to provide each low-to-medium density housing project with pre-sale guarantees of between $5 million and $50 million.\n\nDevelopers with planning approval and at least 50 per cent pre-sales can apply.\n\nTypically, banks require 80 per cent pre-sales.\n\nAfter assessments and approval, they have to begin construction within six months.\n\nIf the homes are sold, the guarantee is extinguished and poured back into the $1 billion fund to be used again for other projects.\n\nIf the homes remain unsold, the developer can call on the guarantee, which means the state will buy the homes at a discounted price.\n\nThe government \ufeffcan then sell these homes to buy or rent, or keep them as affordable or social housing.\n\nTenants' Union of NSW chief executive Leo Patterson Ross. (Tenants' Union of NSW)\n\nAccording to Tenants Union \ufeffof NSW chief executive Leo Patterson Ross, the guarantee partly addressed the financial issues that prevent housing from being built.\n\n\"The guarantee acknowledges that the private market is not well suited to delivering the community's housing needs as opposed to investment returns,\" he said.\n\n\"The financial arrangements needed either prevent housing being built at all, or passes on risks and their financial and non-financial costs to the consumer\ufeff.\"\n\nBut, Ross said, the scheme failed to directly influence the size or type of dwelling, including encouraging affordability. \ufeff\n\n\"The government suggests the guarantee may fast-track 5000 dwellings, though not necessarily through direct expenditure,\" he said. \ufeff\n\n\"We were disappointed that the government did not continue to directly fund the delivery of genuinely affordable, publicly funded housing of which we need many hundreds of thousands, so every billion counts.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other industry groups hailed the scheme as a \"real breakthrough\". (Getty)\n\nMookhey admitted the plan was not a \"silver bullet\" but denied that it was a \"drop in the ocean\".\n\n\"It is a canny use of our state's balancing sheet that is carefully calibrated to bring on 15,000 new dwellings,\" he said at a press conference this week.\n\n\"What this means is that industry can spend less time and resources having to convince their banks that there are buyers of these apartments and more time building them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other industry groups hailed the scheme as a \"real breakthrough\".\n\n\"Projects that tick all the boxes, planning approval, market demand, sound delivery partners, are unable to proceed because developers can't meet unworkable pre-sale thresholds,\" Property Council NSW executive director Katie Stevenson said.\n\n\"The pre-sale finance guarantee responds directly to that issue.\"",

        "text": "US President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada over its tax targeting US technology firms, calling it a \"blatant attack\".\n\nThe move on Friday, local time, plunged US-Canada relations back into chaos after a period of relative calm that included a cordial G7 meeting in mid-June where Mr Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to wrap up a new economic agreement within 30 days.\n\nIt also came just hours after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent struck an upbeat tone on trade, touting that progress had been made with China on reviving the flow of critical minerals for the US manufacturing sector, and in other key tariff negotiations.\n\nThe often-chaotic rollout of Mr Trump's import levies since his return to office this year has frequently whipsawed financial markets, and have begun to weigh on consumer spending, the bedrock of the US economy.\n\nDonald Trump says he will set a new tariff rate for Canada. (AP: Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nUS stocks were briefly batted lower by his broadside against Canada, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq managed to close out the week at record highs.\n\nMr Trump's action comes ahead of Canada's plans to begin collecting on Monday a previously enacted digital services tax on US technology firms, including Amazon, Meta, Alphabet's Google and Apple, among others.\n\nThe tax is 3 per cent of the digital services revenue a firm takes in from Canadian users above $US20 million ($30 million) in a calendar year, and payments will be retroactive to 2022.\n\nMr Trump, in a post on his Truth Social media platform, called the tax \"a direct and blatant attack on our country\" and said Canada was a \"very difficult country to TRADE with\".\n\n\"Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" he said.\n\n\"We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven-day period.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trump said that the negotiations with Canada would not resume \"until they straighten out their act,\" adding that the US holds \"such power over Canada\".\n\nCanada is the second-largest US trading partner after Mexico, and the largest buyer of US exports. It bought $US349.4 billion of US goods last year and exported $US412.7 billion to the US, according to US Census Bureau data.\n\nMr Carney's office responded to Mr Trump's announcement by saying: \"The Canadian government will continue to engage in these complex negotiations with the United States in the best interests of Canadian workers and businesses.\"\n\nMr Bessent sought to downplay the US-Canadian dispute in a CNBC interview, saying US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer would likely open a Section 301 probe into Canada's digital tax that would clear the way for tariff retaliation in the amount of harm to US firms, which he said was roughly $US2 billion.\n\nThe US has prepared similar retaliation against European countries that have imposed digital taxes. A USTR spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWrapped up by Labor Day\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mr Bessent said the Trump administration's various trade deals with other countries could be done by the September 1 Labor Day holiday, citing talks with 18 top trade partners and another revision to a deal with China to reopen the flow of rare earth minerals and magnets.\n\nAfter a week where tariffs took a back seat to the US strike on Iran's nuclear facilities and the massive tax and spending bill in the US Congress, the Trump administration's trade negotiations have picked up.\n\nThe US sent a new proposal to the European Union on Thursday and India sent a delegation to Washington for more talks.\n\n\"So we have countries approaching us with very good deals,\" Mr Bessent said on Fox Business Network.\n\n\"We have 18 important trading partners. \u2026 If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18, there are another important 20 relationships, then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day,\" Mr Bessent said.\n\nHe did not mention any changes to a July 9 deadline for countries to reach deals with the US or see tariffs spike higher, but Mr Trump said at the White House that he could extend the tariff deadline or \"make it shorter\".\n\nMr Trump said that he would notify countries of their tariff rates within the next week and a half, adding: \"I'd like to just send letters out to everybody: Congratulations. You're paying 25 per cent.\"\n\nNew US-China export revisions\n\nMr Bessent said the US and China had resolved issues surrounding shipments of Chinese rare earth minerals and magnets to America, further modifying a deal reached in May in Geneva.\n\nUS and China confirm trade deal framework Photo shows Trump and Xi shake hands with the American and Chinese flags in the background China has confirmed the details of the framework will include Washington looking at \"restrictive measures\", while Beijing will \"review and approve\" items under export control.\n\nAs part of its retaliation against new US tariffs, China suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets, up-ending supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.\n\nDuring US-China talks in May in Geneva, Beijing committed to removing the measures imposed since April 2, but those critical materials were not moving as fast as agreed, Mr Bessent said, so the US put countermeasures in place.\n\n\"I am confident now that \u2026 as agreed, the magnets will flow,\" Mr Bessent said, adding that these materials would go to US firms that had received them previously on a regular basis.\n\nHe later said that the US would begin shipping withheld materials to China when the rare earths shipments resumed.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said on Friday the two countries have confirmed details on the framework of implementing the Geneva trade talks consensus.\n\nIt said China will approve export applications of controlled items in accordance with the law. It did not mention rare earths.\n\nTrump administration officials also held trade talks on Friday with India and Japan, two other countries in advanced negotiations with the US\n\nThe Japanese government said in a statement that the two sides will continue to work to \"reach an agreement that benefits both Japan and the United States\".\n\nReuters",

(AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nPonga's injury is a serious blow to the Maroons, given their game-two win in Perth had offered Billy Slater the prospect of keeping the team intact for Sydney.\n\nNewcastle said in a statement on Saturday that Ponga would begin rehabilitation, \"with the view to returning to play in the back end of the season\".\n\nPonga limped from the field during the second half of the Knights' 22-18 loss, with the injury suffered on the opposite foot to the one he suffered Lisfranc damage to last year.\n\nOn that occasion, he missed seven games for the Knights. A similar timeframe would mean Ponga does not return until the eve of the finals this year.\n\nAlmost immediately after the match on Friday night, Newcastle officials had feared the worst.\n\n\"Kalyn's tough. He doesn't come off for much,\" coach Adam O'Brien said.\n\n\"You have to drag him off the field with a tow truck normally, so it's probably not a good sign.\"\n\nPonga played in the first two games of the Origin series, which is tied at 1-1. (AAP Photos: Dave Hunt)\n\nPonga's injury also comes as a significant setback for Newcastle and O'Brien, after the Knights had shown signs of turning their season around in the past month.\n\nFive-eighth and back-up full-back Fletcher Sharpe is unlikely to return again this year after suffering a lacerated kidney and spleen damage last week.\n\nFletcher Hunt could now be the man to fill in for Ponga.\n\nFor Queensland, it is also a mega blow.\n\nDespite being one of the best full-backs in the competition, Ponga has been restricted to eight games starting for the Maroons since first wearing the jersey in 2019.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Surely there could be no worse fate than a country town losing its last pub in the middle of a drought.\n\nThat's why a south-west Victorian community is banding together in the hope of raising $1 million to buy the town's last remaining watering hole.\n\nSo far, the 670 residents of Penshurst, a rural town about 300 kilometres west of Melbourne, have raised $250,000 to bring the Penshurst Hotel into community hands.\n\nBut the group still has hundreds of thousands of dollars left to raise, with little time left.\n\nPubs 'critical' for communities\n\nAt the turn of the century, there were six pubs in Penshurst, but now only the Penshurst Hotel remains.\n\nThe pub went on the market in April 2025, and the community has tried to buy it out of fear it will be shut down or turned into something else by new owners.\n\nThe group's offer for the property has been accepted by the owners, but sales contracts are yet to be signed.\n\nThe ABC understands there have been four other offers on the property from potential buyers across the state, including from Melbourne and Ballarat.\n\nThe Penshurst Hotel is the last remaining pub in town. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)\n\nRay Allan moved to Penshurst eight months ago and is spearheading the campaign to buy the historic bluestone pub.\n\n\"Pubs are critical things in small towns,\" he said.\n\n\" Towns around the district that have lost their last [pub] have just basically died and fizzled away. \"\n\nThe pub is open a few nights a week, but only for drinks after the bistro closed in January 2024.\n\nThe closest pubs are a half-hour drive away.\n\nMr Allan, who is also a member of the Penshurst Progress Association, said the pub was vital for locals' mental health.\n\n\"This is not about saving the pub,\" he said.\n\n\" This is about saving a critical community asset that's holding the community together. \"\n\nOne shot, one opportunity\n\nAcross the state, a growing number of pubs have been taken over by community groups.\n\nJust this month, 83 community members pitched in to buy the Maroona Hotel near Ararat after the owner put it up for sale.\n\nMr Allan said about 40 Penshurst residents met in April to discuss collective ownership of the Penshurst Hotel, with people invited to buy a unit share worth $5,000 each.\n\nIn six weeks, Mr Allan said about 30 shareholders committed a total of $250,000.\n\nSurrounded by farmland in south-western Victoria, Penshurst is home to about 670 people. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)\n\nOnce the sales contract is signed, the group has about six weeks to raise a further $200,000 to close the deal.\n\nMr Allan said he was feeling confident the necessary funds would be raised, but there was \"also a bit of a niggle\" of doubt.\n\nIf successful, the group hopes to raise yet another $650,000 for repairs to the 1850s-era building, including refurbishing the kitchen and dining areas to reopen the pub for meals.\n\nThe Penshurst Hotel would initially be operated by the community, with the option of leasing it to a third-party operator down the line.\n\nThe pub, pictured here in 1908, is deemed to be of historical and architectural significance. (Supplied: State Library of Victoria)\n\nBuzzing with energy\n\nPenshurst resident Kate Orchard said many of the people who had contributed were farmers who were battling the drought.\n\n\"They are doing it so tough with feed costing what it does, but they realise how important this was and [found] that little bit of money,\" Ms Orchard said.\n\nLocals hope bringing the pub back to its glory days will help revitalise the town. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)\n\n\"The front street looks like a smile with the front teeth gone.\n\n\"This is a one-shot go \u2026 if this fails, we probably won't ever get it off the ground again.\"\n\nEileen Copeland operates the local post office and is among those who contributed to the fund.\n\nShe said she hoped a successful pub would bring more people to town.\n\nEileen Copeland owns the local post office and has pitched in to help buy the pub. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)\n\n\"The more people who stop in the town, the more likely they're going to wander in here and buy something from me,\" she said.\n\nCan it work?\n\nAustralian Hotels Association chief executive Paddy O'Sullivan said community-owned pubs that pitched themselves as a tourist destination, as well as being a local hotspot, were best placed to succeed.\n\nMr O'Sullivan said communities needed to be prepared for the challenges involved in running a pub, such as staffing and the long hours, and ensuring it was financially viable.\n\nBut he said he believed the trend of more establishments entering public ownership would continue.\n\n\"It's great to see,\" he said.",

        "text": "Jayde Guest spends most evenings in extreme pain.\n\nFor almost a year, the mother of two from Esperance, 700 kilometres south-east of Perth, has barely been able to work or socialise.\n\nShe feels as though her life has been stripped of all its best parts.\n\n\"By night time, most of the time, I'm on the couch crying,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm at the end of my tether right now.\n\n\"Day-to-day life is a real challenge.\"\n\nWhile she has turned to Western Australia's health system numerous times for help, she said the process had only compounded her suffering.\n\nMs Guest is grieving her old life, after battling chronic pain for almost a year. (Supplied: Jayde Guest)\n\n'The too-hard basket'\n\nThe pain, which \"feels like her chest wall is caving in\", arrived out of the blue on a normal winter's morning.\n\nIt has returned each day since, intensifying the more active she is and often becoming unbearable by night.\n\nHer doctor's first suspicion was cancer, as she had been in remission from an aggressive form called osteosarcoma for about 20 years.\n\nBut the medical system was at a loss when tests ruled out cancer.\n\nMs Guest survived bone cancer in her early 20s. (Supplied: Jayde Guest)\n\nShe made the journey to Perth, seeing five different specialists on separate occasions, none of whom could produce the answers she sought.\n\nMs Guest said she was then twice rejected from the WA Health Department's central referral service \u2014 designed to triage and allocate cases \u2014 and the hospital stopped calling her back.\n\n\"I [was] in the too-hard basket,\" she said.\n\n\" So I decided to take it into my own hands. \"\n\nMs Guest says her current battle with chronic pain is more isolating than her cancer experience. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nAn answer at last\n\nMs Guest said she turned to support groups on social media and sought out experts in London, America, Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nFinally, she found someone who might have an answer to her pain.\n\nDuring her previous bone cancer battle, she had five ribs removed and replaced with a Gore-Tex mesh.\n\nA doctor in Sydney believes the 20-year-old mesh is now shrinking and pulling against her chest wall.\n\nThe doctor, who specialises in mesh removal, told Ms Guest they were confident of being able to remove hers but is still working out how to rebuild her chest wall.\n\nMs Guest is relieved to have a way forward, but the wait continues as they work on a solution.\n\nMs Guest believes mesh inserted in her chest following cancer treatment could be causing the pain. (Supplied: Jayde Guest)\n\nShe said the uncertainty of her experience felt harder than the 16 rounds of chemotherapy she endured in her 20s.\n\n\"The lack of communication from the medical system has been really disappointing,\" she said.\n\n\"And I think that's what makes people feel really alone.\n\n\" I was pretty much depressed because I was searching for an answer that no-one was giving. \"\n\nWhile Ms Guest can manage small tasks like getting coffee in the morning, she is generally in severe pain by night. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n'It's not ideal'\n\nClare Mullen, executive director at WA's Health Consumers Council, said experiences like Ms Guest's happened \"too often\".\n\nBut Ms Mullen said cases involving regional patients and chronic pain could be particularly difficult.\n\nShe said this was due to the disconnect between country GPs and metropolitan health professionals and the scepticism that could follow chronic pain.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's one of the areas where we see a lot of people having to convince the clinicians \u2026 that their pain is real.\"\n\nMs Mullen said anyone feeling like their case was not progressing or who had been rejected from the service should contact the GP who made their first referral.\n\n\"It's not ideal, particularly in a case like this [where] someone is living with chronic pain,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a time-consuming process.\"\n\nMs Mullen said if they still had no luck, they should contact the Health Consumers Council.\n\nAbout 3.7 million Australians suffer through chronic pain. (Pexels: Karolina Grabowska)\n\nMonika Boogs, chief executive of Pain Australia, said the number of Australians suffering chronic pain was about 3.7 million and growing.\n\nBut Ms Boogs said there were only about 200 pain specialists in the country, with access proving particularly difficult for regional residents.\n\nShe said a national action plan for pain management was done six years ago, but many programs were still unfunded.\n\n\"Pain is like mental health was 20 years ago. It's something that's growing. It's impacting so many people,\" she said.\n\n\" We need to help because if we do nothing, it's going to cost our community even more in the future. \"\n\nWA Health Minister Meredith Hammat said the health system aimed to provide world-class care to all West Australians.\n\n\"We will never stop working to advance the care our health system provides,\" she said.\n\nA WA Health spokesperson said initiatives were in progress to improve access to public specialist outpatient services.\n\nSharing her journey\n\nTo help others, Ms Guest started blogging about her experience.\n\nShe said she was a big believer in documenting experiences and helping others to advocate within the medical system.\n\n\"By me sharing it, I've had people open up to me and hopefully I've helped them to see that they're not alone.\n\nMs Guest has a supportive family to keep her going. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n\"And Facebook groups, as much as they can be a little bit negative sometimes, I've found some great people and great friends going through similar things to me.\n\n\"And that's definitely helped.\"\n\nMs Guest said it also kept her sane, as the wait for a cure continued.\n\n\"I really, really want my life back,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's hard for people to understand because I look kind of normal, I don't walk around going, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm in so much pain.'\n\n\"I just have to carry on.\"",

        "text": "For a match that appeared evenly poised at the end of day two, Australia's crushing 159-run Test victory over the West Indies was remarkable in its scale.\n\nMid-way through day two of the first Test in Barbados, the hosts held a 10-run first innings lead.\n\nAustralia had been bowled out for just 180 on the first day having won the toss and batted.\n\nIn the second innings, the visitors were 4-65 after another woeful top order batting display.\n\nA thrilling Test match was assured, wasn't it?\n\nAlas, Test match cricket does nothing if not exploit and expose the inadequacies between the very best and the rest \u2014 and Josh Hazlewood is very much among the best.\n\nThe 34-year-old was absolutely unplayable on a wearing, minefield of a pitch.\n\nHis five-over second spell was almost mythical, a fitting addition to the tapestry that is the Kensington Oval, one of the world's most storied Test grounds.\n\nBut the game was in the balance \u2014 a couple of quick wickets and Australia would have been defending a far more modest score than the 301 runs they managed to accrue.\n\nThe hardest thing for the West Indies to accept may well be that the chance to take that early wicket presented itself in the fourth over of the day.\n\nTravis Head, on 21, gifted an edge to second slip off the bowling of Alzarri Joseph.\n\nHead was dropped early on day three. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nJustin Greaves at second slip did what too many of his teammates had done throughout the Test \u2014 he dropped it cold.\n\nThe West Indies were, unfortunately, found lacking in the basic skills of the game, catching.\n\nIt's a troubling issue and one that is not unknown to the West Indies.\n\nThe host broadcaster showed a graphic before the start of play on day three that highlighted that the West Indies were the worst catchers in Test cricket at slips and gully, snaring just 65.6 per cent of their chances in Tests since 2023.\n\nIn this Test they caught a truly woeful 36 per cent of their chances in that area.\n\nIn a game where the hosts put seven catches down, how does one determine which was the defining drop of the contest?\n\nThe first? That one shelled by Brendon King no doubt set the tone for the shambles that followed.\n\nBut realistically it was the one on that third morning.\n\nAustralia was 4-107 at he time, their lead under 100.\n\nHead went on to score 61, his second half century of the match as part of a 102-run partnership with Beau Webster.\n\nBeau Webster scored his third Test half century. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nWhile Head continued where he left off with his first innings, Webster's half century was just a continuation of the norm for what has been a superb start to Test cricket.\n\nVictim to a brute of a ball in the first innings to be out for 11, in this second stint he was immense.\n\nIn what was just his eighth Test match innings, the 31-year-old Tasmanian scored his third half century and did so with impressive composure.\n\nHis height allows him to easily get down the pitch and his timing through the covers was simply sublime.\n\nWith two crucial wickets in the West Indies batting innings on day two already under his belt, the man from Snug is looking increasingly secure in that all rounder role.\n\nAlex Carey also impressed with a well-paced counter attacking display that saw him shift roles three times throughout his stay.\n\nAlex Carey played a sublime innings. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAfter playing the supporting role to Webster early and stepping back into that familiar tail end hand holder at the end of his stay, he still blasted a 40-ball half century \u2014 his fastest in Tests \u2014 with the final 40 runs coming in 15 balls, including a monstrous six back over Jayden Seales' head that crashed into the sightscreen.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nIt was a brutal display of power that illustrated just how valuable he is down at number seven, the Jekyll and Hyde position that has to adapt and shift to the circumstances in front of him.\n\nBut the impetus Australia managed to gain still, arguably, came from that dropped catch in the first hour.\n\nAfter day two, coach Daren Sammy rightly pointing out that his team were \"shooting ourselves in the foot\" more than anything else.\n\nThe 38-Test capped Saint Lucian may have hoped that by vocalising the issue his team would holster their self-destructive weapons for day three.\n\nInstead, they loaded them right back up and continued to aim at their own boots.\n\nThe honour board of West Indian catching incompetence for this Test is lengthy and frustrating, a blight on the heroes of 1975 who were being honoured on the 50th anniversary of the West Indies' Cricket World Cup triumph in 1975 at the ground on the opening day.\n\nBrandon King, on debut, had three entries in the first day: Cameron Green (0), Usman Khawaja (45) and Nathan Lyon (3).\n\nFortunately for him, those particular drops cost the West Indies just 11 runs.\n\nThe skipper, Roston Chase, was not so lucky \u2014 Khawaja added 41 more runs after he was dropped on 6 by him at first slip.\n\nOn day two, add John Campbell at third slip and Justin Greaves at second both dropped Sam Konstas in a single Shamar Joseph over while he was on 0.\n\nAgain, to the West Indies' relief, Konstas failed to capitalise, only managing another 5 runs before being bowled.\n\nHead was a different story.\n\n\"Holding onto that catch could have changed the game,\" former West Indies player Carlos Brathwaite said on ESPN.\n\nSo was it the catching that has cost the West Indies the match?\n\nIt's clearly not the only thing given Australia's bowling brilliance.\n\nStarc removed Braithwaite in the first over of the West Indies chase. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAs the Kensington Oval pitch began to crumble, Hazlewood came to the fore.\n\nHazlewood's recent susceptibility to injury has given Australia a look ahead to a near future where this brilliant pace-bowling trio will no longer be around.\n\nBut his phenomenal five-over spell of 4-5 showed that Australia still needs him.\n\nMitch Starc and Pat Cummins also claimed wickets among the seamers, but the strength of this pace triumvirate is its ability to work together.\n\nBut it was that brilliant burst from the Tamworth tearaway that caught the eye most.\n\nOn a pitch offering plenty of assistance, its erratic nature was exploited by the kind of unerring accuracy that has become this seam attack's signature characteristic.\n\nShould the West Indies first innings lead have been more?\n\nUndoubtedly, the desperately poor third umpiring decisions made by Adrian Holdstock that may yet result in the West Indies issuing a formal complaint against the South African no doubt cruelled any prospect that the West Indies had of turning that narrow lead into one that was far more substantial.\n\n'Flabbergasted': The decisions that went against the West Indies Photo shows Shamar Joseph bites his white jersey with his hands on his hips. The West Indies have every right to feel aggrieved after a number of third umpire decisions went against the home side during the first Test against Australia at the Kensington Oval.\n\n\"Me and Shai Hope, we were having a good partnership and then, obviously a few calls set us back a bit,\" Chase said at the post-match presentation.\n\n\"I still thought we did well to get the lead, but we couldn't put any batting innings together.\"\n\nThat much is true, but the West Indies must also take ownership of their own frailties \u2014 such a woeful catching display will rarely lead to Test victories against a team of Australia's calibre.\n\nThe second Test in Grenada gets underway on July 4.\n\nNot a long enough break to cure the catching woes.\n\nBut perhaps short enough to get back on the horse and make things right through their own actions.",

        "text": "Australia completed a massive 159-run first Test victory over the West Indies on an action-packed third day.\n\nA wearing pitch, another terrible West Indies drop in the slips and Josh Hazlewood's rapid-fire \"five-fa\" all combined for a memorable day's cricket.\n\nHere are five quick hits from day three in Barbados.\n\n1. Head dropped again\n\nHead was dropped early on day three. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAlthough the West Indies had dropped seven catches over the first two days in Barbados, none of them had proved to be too consequential.\n\nSooner or later, however, one was bound to come back to bite them.\n\nAnd when, during just the fourth over of the day, Justin Greaves shelled yet another chance in the cordon, that moment had finally come.\n\nTravis Head hung his bat out to a wide Alzarri Joseph delivery, looping one in the direction of a diving Greaves at a comfortable speed and height.\n\nThe ball went in, and then out, and Head was given a life on 21.\n\nFrom there he went on to score 61 as part of a 102-run partnership with Beau Webster, Australia's lead 157 and well on the way to being enough to secure victory on a pitch showing increasingly variable bounce.\n\n2. Bouncy bouncy\n\nTravis Head was trapped LBW to a ball that barely bounced. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nJoseph has had rotten luck this Test.\n\nA questionable third umpire call robbing him of a five-fa in the first innings, and five dropped catches off his bowling costing both him and the West Indies plenty more.\n\nHe's had to do it all himself at times, as was the case when Head eventually fell for 61.\n\nJoseph's delivery was a peach but, crucially, virtually unplayable, barely bouncing and cleaning up Australia's best batter.\n\nIt was far from the only time the pitch played a role in taking a wicket.\n\nMitch Starc was cleaned up by a ball that jagged in a huge distance from outside off, again Joseph the bowler.\n\nYes, it was a crucial breakthrough that the West Indies desperately needed.\n\nBut it made Australia's bowlers sit up a little straighter as they contemplated bowling on a wearing and cracking pitch.\n\n3. Carey's rapid-fire 50\n\nAlex Carey played a sublime innings. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nBatting at number seven, you often have to be everything to everyone.\n\nJoining an established upper-order player in the middle, your role is to sit quietly and make sure your partner is confident they won't have to worry about farming the strike, and just continue to bat as they were.\n\nBatting with the tail, you have to show composure with one hand to farm the strike and extend the innings as long as possible, while also flashing any loose deliveries away to keep the scoreboard ticking over.\n\nIt's Jekyll and Hyde.\n\nAlex Carey showed he was perfectly adapted to it.\n\nStarting with Webster, Carey made 10 runs in 25 balls.\n\nAfter his dismissal he scored 40 in 15, blasting the ball to all corners of the ground to record his fastest ever Test half century.\n\nAs Pat Cummins and Starc fell, Carey went back into his shell, masterfully steering the ball around the field, selecting his running options and shielding Nathan Lyon as much as possible \u2014 while also ramping Joseph for a one-bounce four.\n\n4. Shamar Joseph hits out\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nThe game was very much gone.\n\nBut Joseph sure wasn't going to go quietly.\n\nAt one stage he was on track to score the fastest ever Test half century as he smashed Hazlewood, Starc and Lyon to all corners of the famous Kensington Oval.\n\nHaving already taken 9-133 in the match with the ball, Shamar's fireworks were astonishing \u2014 especially given the West Indies were 8-86 and facing a monster defeat.\n\nHe hit four 4s and four 6s in his 22-ball innings but ultimately fell just short of a maiden Test half century.\n\nBut it was fun while it lasted.\n\n5. Hazlewood breaks it open\n\nJosh Hazlewood took two wickets in two balls to start a brilliant flurry of wickets. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAll it took was two Hazlewood deliveries.\n\nThe West Indies, a first over Starc strike aside, had made a promising start to their run chase.\n\nJohn Campbell had played expressively for his 23, but he took things a step too far when he got down to scoop Hazlewood over the slips on one knee in the 11th over.\n\nThe ball glanced off the glove, looping high into the air but, crucially, not far.\n\nCarey cantered back a couple paces and took an easy catch.\n\nThen, the very next ball, Brandon King edged onto his pads only to see the ball balloon to Cameron Green at gully.",

        "text": "Australia's agriculture industry is calling for stronger penalties for breaching biosecurity controls after a woman avoided jail for illegally importing more than 62 tonnes of meat and produce from Thailand to distribute on Sydney's black market.\n\nThe items, including raw and cooked pork, frogs, edible insects, beef, chicken, fish, raw prawns and insect-infested fruit, were intercepted at the border in 2021 after a tip-off.\n\nThe woman failed to accurately declare the products and on June 11 was sentenced by a District Court judge to a 24-month intensive corrections order and 150 hours of community service.\n\nDAFF intercepted the illegal imports after a tip-off. (Supplied: Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry)\n\nTests on the goods showed positive results for diseases, including African swine fever, Newcastle disease and white spot disease, raising concerns across the Australian agricultural industry.\n\nAustralian Pork Limited CEO Margo Andrae said the introduction of African swine fever could cost the Australian industry $2.5 billion.\n\n\"Australia has incredibly strict biosecurity laws for a very good reason. We don't have the diseases that are out there globally,\" she said.\n\nMargo Andrae says biosecurity breaches pose a huge threat to Australian producers. (Supplied: Cattle Council of Australia )\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) said the items were tested for trace presence of diseases and positive results did not necessarily indicate a viable presence.\n\nInsect-infested fruit was also seized and subjected to cold storage treatment before inspection.\n\nDAFF's Compliance and Enforcement Division first assistant secretary Anna Brezzo said the detections did not indicate broader outbreaks within Australia.\n\nPrawn industry concerned\n\nThe detection of white spot disease in the items also worried the Australian prawn industry.\n\nAustralian Prawn Farmers Association executive officer Kim Hooper said white spot, while harmless to humans, had the potential to decimate Australia's prawn industry.\n\nKim Hooper has renewed calls to ban prawn imports. (ABC News: Tom Forbes)\n\nWithin Australia, the movement of raw prawns from locations where white spot has been detected is banned, but raw prawns can be imported with a permit from countries with white spot disease.\n\nMs Hooper described the regulations as a \"double standard\" and called for a consistent approach to imported prawns.\n\n\"Fishers and farmers are doing all the right things in that containment area,\" she said.\n\n\"They're not moving raw product out of that containment area. It has to be cooked.\n\nThe white spot virus doesn't harm humans but is deadly to prawns. (Supplied: DigsFish services)\n\n\"But we're not seeing that same level of biosecurity at the border \u2014 we're not seeing only cooked [prawns] coming across the Australian border.\n\n\"So it just beggars belief about how this is actually happening and why our own businesses in Australia are being treated differently to what importers are.\"\n\nCalls for stronger penalties\n\nMs Hooper said the penalties for the woman did not \"reflect the scale of the threat\" from the illegal importation.\n\n\"This was a calculated operation involving false documentation and product substitution. The consequences should be equally serious,\" she said.\n\n\"The government needs to step up. There needs to be increased penalties for deliberate breaches such as this.\n\nRaw prawns were among the items intercepted. (Supplied: Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry)\n\n\"They need to close the regulatory gaps that allow these black market operations to exploit our system and they need to modernise the border protection systems.\"\n\nMs Andre agreed stronger penalties were needed to deter further illegal import attempts.\n\n\"We need a really strong deterrent for these people. They're putting our industries at risk,\" she said.\n\n\"[It's] great to see that DAFF caught them, but now we need the judicial systems to actually really put the full strength of the penalties in place.\"",

It's heartbreaking, gut-wrenching.\"\n\nThe risk for Hayden, if he were to go without regular physiotherapy, is significant.\n\n\"If there's no intervention, he's likely to end up in a ball due to tightening muscles,\" Ms Caldow said.\n\n\"That will impact his ability to function, his ability to walk and his ability to use his arm.\"\n\nConstant battle for adequate support exhausting\n\nLaura Moorby says with her family already missing out on so much living in a regional town, the potential loss of travelling providers is devastating. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nMs Moorby will do whatever it takes to prevent her son from missing out \u2014 including making the three-hour round trip to Canberra \u2014 but admitted the constant battle for adequate support was exhausting.\n\n\"I'd do anything for my children, but it's been an uphill battle from the beginning with Hayden so to find out we have another challenge in front of us, it's just really hard,\" she said.\n\n\"It's honestly devastating, a real kick in the guts.\n\n\"And it's like it's targeted at us. We already miss out on so much living in a country town and now they're taking this away from us as well.\"\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson for the NDIA described the caps to hourly rates as \"modest\".\n\nAn NDIA spokesperson said the changes to travel claims were in direct response to feedback from NDIS participants. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)\n\n\"It's important that NDIS participants are paying prices that are fair and in line with industry standards,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"In some cases, NDIS price limits exceeded the market rate by up to 68 per cent.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said the changes to travel claims were in direct response to feedback from NDIS participants.\n\n\"We heard from participants that excessive travel claims for therapy-related services were draining participant's plans faster than expected,\" they said.\n\n\"The updated travel therapy claiming rules encourage more efficient scheduling by providers and provide clear cost expectations for participants to help them get better value from their funding.\"\n\nSeventh year without occupational therapy pricing increase\n\nLike most five year olds, Jon Beit loves Bluey, trains and playing in playgrounds.\n\nBut unlike most other children his age, Jon requires an array of equipment to do the things he loves.\n\nFive-year-old Jon Beit lives with a genetic condition called spinal muscular atrophy. (Supplied)\n\nHe also relies on equipment to move, eat, sleep and shower.\n\n\"Jon lives with a genetic condition called spinal muscular atrophy,\" his mother Megan Beit said.\n\n\" It's a muscle-wasting condition and it means he needs support for basically everything he does. \"\n\nIt's occupational therapist Kat Senger who has been there every step of the way \u2014 picking the appropriate equipment and ensuring it's correctly fitted at home and school.\n\nHer Canberra clinic, Little Hands OT, is focused on children with high, complex needs, with NDIS participants accounting for 95 per cent of her client base.\n\nThe latest NDIA pricing review delivered her an unwelcome blow.\n\n\"Before these changes, I would say we were surviving, not thriving,\" Ms Senger said.\n\nAlthough occupational therapy won't see a reduction in pricing caps, it will endure a seventh year without a pricing increase from $193.99.\n\nHalved travel subsidies increase pressure\n\nOccupational therapist Kat Senger (left) says she's now considering introducing a gap fee to cover travel costs. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nVisits to a client's home, school or work as well as experiences in the community, such as supermarkets and on public transport, are foundational for occupational therapy.\n\nGiven that, the cut to travel claims will also put additional pressure on Ms Senger's business.\n\n\"Ultimately, occupational therapy is about life skills, so we practice those in our clinic but if we don't go into the environment, there's no way of knowing if those skills are transferring,\" Ms Senger said.\n\n\"And for some of our families, they just can't come here \u2014 they're financially strapped or they're single parents with four children who all require care \u2014 so we go to them.\"\n\nMs Senger is now considering introducing a gap fee to cover travel costs.\n\n\"We wouldn't change anything in terms of the hourly rate,\" Ms Senger said.\n\n\"For us, the gap fee would be the 50 per cent travel that the NDIS has taken away.\n\n\"Anything more, we will do our hardest to avoid.\"\n\nMegan Beit (left) says a gap fee for travel could mean her son Jon's occupational therapy is too expensive for the family. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nIt's a price Jon's mother, Megan, is not confident her family can afford to pay.\n\n\"Having a gap fee would mean either we miss out, we can't afford it therefore Jon misses out,\" she said.\n\n\"Or something else gets missed in order to pay for it \u2014 maybe that's takeaway one night or a night out at the movies.\n\n\"I think it's really heartbreaking that you have to make those choices.\"\n\n'It's a pretty big kick in the guts'\n\nMs Senger and Ms Caldow are still considering workforce changes, but both have made the decision to let go of their therapy assistants, who are typically university students.\n\n\"I was really hopeful this time around that with all the cost of living increases, wage increases, superannuation increases, the NDIA would see the numbers weren't adding up,\" Ms Senger said.\n\n\"I can't believe that's not been recognised and instead we're being portrayed as money hungry, price-gouging, fraudulent allied health professionals because of a few bad eggs, which are in every profession.\n\n\"All I want is to provide the best care for my kids and these new changes really stop us from being able to do that.\"\n\nDisability Intermediaries Australia CEO Jess Harper says plan managers and financial intermediaries are also reeling from the upcoming changes. (Supplied)\n\nIn Australia, more than 65 per cent of NDIS participants have their funds managed by a financial intermediary or plan manager.\n\nJess Harper, the chief executive of Disability Intermediaries Australia, said those working in that sector are also reeling.\n\n\"It's a pretty big kick in the guts,\" he said.\n\n\"It will now be seven years of systemic price freezes.\n\n\"And on top of that, the NDIA has also made the decision to pretty significantly cut the amount and the type of service plan managers can claim for.\"\n\nFrom July 1, a one-off establishment fee of $232 will be scrapped and some loading charges will also be removed, with a nationally consistent price introduced.\n\n\"In the last 12 months, we've seen more than 600 providers close their doors because they just can't keep the lights on and we expect that number will be significantly more this year,\" Mr Harper said.\n\n\"In the ACT, we've had 22 providers close their doors in the past 12 months, and we've had a further four give notice that they'll be closing come July 1.\n\n\"Ultimately, what we're seeing is a race to the bottom on quality and so for participants, that means they're getting less \u2014 less choice, less access, less availability.\"\n\nIndependent pricing 'makes a lot of sense'\n\nMr Harper said introducing an independent pricing approach was vital.\n\n\"The sector has been calling for this for years,\" he said.\n\n\"It is beyond belief that a government agency that is ultimately the payer gets to set the prices.\"\n\nNational Disability Services chief executive Michael Perusco says it would be valuable to introduce an independent pricing approach to the NDIS. (ABC News: Billy Draper)\n\nIt's a view shared by Michael Perusco, the chief executive of National Disability Services, an organisation that advocates for disability service organisations.\n\n\"Like aged care, like health, we think it makes a lot of sense for pricing in the NDIS to be independent,\" Mr Perusco said.\n\n\" That ensures people get the support they need and providers are compensated for the level of complexity of their work. \"\n\nHe said he was \"deeply concerned\" that providers of therapy support were going to leave the market.\n\n\"Organisations are looking at their finances and are going to make very difficult decisions about what they can continue and what they can't,\" Mr Perusco said.\n\n\"For some of those organisations, it means they won't continue at all.\n\n\"If that occurs, participants suffer and particularly those with the most complex needs who need the NDIS the most.\"",

        "text": "Major changes have been proposed to restrict access to a common over-the-counter vitamin linked to a growing number of poisoning cases.\n\nVitamin B6 \u2014 often listed as pyridoxine, pyridoxal, or pyridoxamine \u2014 is present in thousands of products in Australia as an additive, including medicines, multivitamin and mineral supplements, energy drinks and weight loss shakes.\n\nMore than 170 reports of peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy or chronic polyneuropathy for products containing B6 have been reported to the medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), though medical practitioners predict the true number is significantly higher.\n\n\"There are likely hundreds of thousands of Australians who are taking far too much vitamin B6,\" Michael Bonning from the Australian Medical Association said.\n\n\"While most of them have no side effects, if you are taking large doses of B6 your risk of peripheral neuropathy goes up.\n\n\"We know that reported cases of peripheral neuropathy are a massive underestimate of the problem in the community because so many people are unaware that vitamins can cause these symptoms.\"\n\nMichael Bonning says most people get all the vitamins they need from their daily diet. (ABC News: Rahni Sadler)\n\nIn a new development to improve public safety, several recommendations have been handed down in a report penned by a senior TGA medical officer known as \"the delegate\".\n\nCalled the \"Interim Decision\", the report acts on the advice of the government's Advisory Committee on Medicines Scheduling.\n\nMost notably, it calls for the TGA to reclassify supplements containing more than 50mg of B6 as Schedule 3 (Pharmacist Only), by February 2027.\n\nThe move would affect about 100 products, requiring pharmacists to first speak with consumers before approving a purchase.\n\n\"Currently, preparations providing up to 200 mg of [B6] \u2026 are available for self-selection without any professional guidance or oversight,\" the report states, adding \"almost 80 per cent of these products provide a dose of more than 2 mg/day, which is above the RDI for pyridoxine, pyridoxal or pyridoxamine.\n\n\" The daily requirement of vitamin B6 can be easily obtained from the usual Australian diet, and the use of supplemental vitamin B6 provides limited benefit except in people who have a clinically diagnosed vitamin B6 deficiency. \"\n\nA TGA spokesperson told 7.30 that the decision, if implemented, \"will reduce the maximum amount of vitamin B6 allowed in oral products than currently available for general sale\".\n\nSupplements take up major space in pharmacies. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard)\n\n\"The interim decision balances the risks and benefits of using vitamin B6, including the risk of peripheral neuropathy, acknowledging its potential for irreversible harm at higher doses and variability in individual metabolism,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBut, as detailed in the report, the proposed changes only account for about 7 per cent of supplements containing B6 \u2014 there are more than 1,500 vitamins listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, the majority of which are unscheduled and available over the counter.\n\nThe report also recommended supplements exceeding 200mg should be reclassified as prescription medicines or \"schedule 4\".\n\nCaroline Diamantis has warned of the dangers of complementary medicines. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard)\n\n\"It's a good thing that pharmacists will be able to have a really good counselling session with a patient to make sure the item they're taking doesn't interact with other medications,\" said Caroline Diamantis, vice-president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia.\n\n\"People used to think that complimentary medicines were completely safe, but the more we delve into it, the more we understand they do have unwanted side effects or interference with other medications,\" she told 7.30.\n\nLabel changes needed\n\nThe interim decision also recommends tightening labelling rules, calling for clearer identification of vitamin B6 on packaging and stronger warnings to help consumers avoid accidental overexposure.\n\nSupplements containing too much Vitamin B6 have been known to cause nerve damage. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard)\n\n\"Use of ingredient names in labelling is inconsistent and confusing for consumers \u2026 and not always described as vitamin B6,\" the report said.\n\n\"Of concern is that there are several products on the market where the front of the label provides no indication that vitamin B6 is an ingredient.\"\n\nIt suggested changing the language on warning labels to be more direct.\n\n\"Excess consumption of vitamin B6 can cause nerve damage. Stop use and see a doctor if you experience tingling, burning or numbness,\" was a suggestion.\n\nThe report also calls on the multi-billion-dollar complementary medicines sector to take greater responsibility for educating consumers and reducing the risk of vitamin B6 overexposure, noting current labelling places too much burden on consumers to calculate total B6 intake.\n\n\"Estimating the total daily vitamin B6 intake \u2026 is likely to be beyond the health literacy capability of the typical consumer,\" it said.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe CEO of Complementary Medicines Australia, John O'Doherty, told 7.30: \"We'll be carefully reviewing the interim decision and the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Medicines Scheduling.\"\n\nMr O'Doherty argued adverse events relating to the use of vitamin B6 are \"extremely rare\".\n\n\"Based on a comparison of sales data with the TGA's public Database of Adverse Events, the chance of a reaction is less than one in half a million \u2014 this is extremely rare,\" he said.\n\nHowever, previous 7.30 investigations have found dozens of Australians have had issues from B6 toxicity, with many only becoming aware of their illness after seeing our reports.\n\nThe TGA delegate also warns the prevalence could be much higher.\n\nSupplements with high levels of B6 in them have caused cases of B6 toxicity. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\n\"The true rate of occurrence of an adverse event cannot be determined from spontaneous adverse event reporting systems due to both general under-reporting and a lack of usage data,\" its report read.\n\n\"A low number of spontaneous adverse event reports cannot be considered evidence of the absence of a safety issue.\"\n\nMr O'Doherty however agreed with some of the labelling recommendations, telling 7.30 his organisation has \"been calling on the TGA to implement changes that allow labels and advertising to use terminology and ingredient names that consumers better understand\".\n\n\"At CMA's request, this is now under internal review at the TGA\", he said.\n\nClass action investigation progressing\n\nMedical negligence lawyer Nick Mann said the interim decision is a \"small step in the right direction\" but argued the TGA \"can and should\" go further.\n\nNick Mann says his law firm has launched a class action against Blackmores. ((Supplied))\n\nMr Mann told 7.30 his legal firm, Polaris, is pursuing a class action lawsuit against one of the largest companies in the complementary medicines industry, Blackmores, \"as a matter of public interest and safety\".\n\n\"We continue to investigate the potential class action, and given the response, the support and the evidence that's been pouring in \u2026 with over 140 people contacting us to date,\" Mr Mann said.\n\n\"Each of them had heartbreaking stories about how their lives have been affected by B6 toxicity, and sadly, many of them continue to be affected long after ceasing supplements containing Vitamin B6.\n\n\"We've also had at least 10 doctors contact us to tell us about their own experiences with B6, and to let us know that they have discovered B6 toxicity in several of their patients, after taking supplements containing higher than the RDI of the vitamin over weeks and months,\" he said.\n\nThe interim decision recommends the changes be made by February 1 2027 \u2014 offering an 18-month implementation period.\n\nWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV",

        "text": "As Australia's east coast braces for chilly nights this weekend, that means many of us will be cranking up the heaters and bracing for an eye-watering power bill.\n\nA rise in power prices from July 1 for people in three states also doesn't make things easier.\n\nBut there are ways to keep your electricity bill down during winter \u2014 while staying warm.\n\nHere are some tips recommended by ABC readers.\n\nBe smart with your thermostat\n\nNo, this doesn't mean setting your air conditioner to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nYou want to avoid the temptation to heat a room any more than you need to, or you'll end up hurting your hip pockets.\n\nEnergy Australia recommends setting your temperature between the sweet spot of 18-20C in winter.\n\nEvery extra degree increases your heating energy use by up to 10 per cent.\n\nAnd don't forget to only heat the rooms you are actually using and shut the doors to the others. This concentrates the heat where you need it most.\n\nDon't have a heater?\n\nThat's okay! There are still some easy, low-cost changes you can implement to keep warm.\n\nHere is what experts and some ABC readers suggest, based on their own experiences.\n\nLayer up It may seem obvious, but wrapping up in fluffy sweaters and thick socks can be an easy way to stay comfortable. Jackie from the Central Coast in NSW swears by the 3B's: Beanie, Blanket and Bed socks. \"I managed to get through last winter without using any powered heating,\" she says. \"I've lived in a cold area for years and found that dressing properly works really well. \"I wear thermal clothing when necessary, put a dressing gown on and always wear socks or slippers.\" Michael from Canberra uses one particular mantra when winter comes: \"There's no such thing as cold weather, just poor clothing choices.\" Blankets After you have layered on the appropriate clothing, the next step would be to cosy up with some blankets. This could include your standard blanket, but also an electric one or a heated throw. Energy Australia says: \"On average, electric blankets cost about four cents an hour, compared to some space heaters which can cost around 15 cents an hour.\" Lee from South Australia says her heated throw blankets are \"lovely and warm\", and for under $100 each, \"a very good investment\". Thermal curtains Up to 40 per cent of heating can be lost through windows. So the key here is to lock the warmth in. Let in the free heat by opening curtains and blinds on sunny days. As the Sun starts to dip, close them up to help reduce the amount of air exchange between a cold window and the rest of the room. Essentially, you want to trap the cold air behind the curtain. For this to be as effective as possible, you will want to invest in quality thermal curtains and blinds such as honeycomb blinds. But if you do not have thermal curtains, that's OK. You can still take advantage of the winter sunshine by opening and closing them at the right time. Reverse ceiling fans Did you know that reversing your ceiling fans can make a room feel warmer in winter? That is because warm air rises, and you want to get the warmer air back down to floor level where the people are. A fan spinning clockwise on reverse or 'winter mode' will push down warm air that has drifted upwards. This redistribution of warm air can dramatically change the overall ambient temperature of a room and make it a few degrees warmer than it otherwise would be. You can check your remote control for a reverse function button. If you don't have a remote control, most fans have a switch on the side of their motor labelled forward/reverse or summer/winter. Just flick the switch to change the rotation. Adjust hot water system temperature Water heaters account for around 29 per cent of the average household's energy use. You can cut down on the energy your hot water system uses by adjusting the temperature. If you've got a storage hot water system, you want to set the temperature to 60C, according to Green Building Council Australia. That is because you need it to be at least 60C to stop the growth of Legionella bacteria, but any higher than that means energy is being used unnecessarily. A continuous flow, or instantaneous system does not need to be set as high as it does not store the water, so it should be no higher than 50C. Michael from the Northern Rivers region of NSW, who has solar panels, turns his hot water off at the meter box overnight and back on in the morning. \"All my water heating is essentially done by the Sun's rays,\" he says. \"I have learnt that I only need to heat water every second day over winter, whereas in summer I only heat my water once or twice a week.\" Also consider insulating the exposed pipes running from the hot water system and your hot water storage tank if you have one. If you are heading on holiday over the winter period, turn the hot water system off. But when you return, you will need to ensure that the water is heated and stored above 60C before use. This could take several hours. Draught proof cracks and gaps Sealing unintended openings in your home can save you up to 25 per cent on your heating bills. And this is one of the cheapest options to implement. During COVID, Carina Turner made several \"door sausages\" to stop drafts coming into her Victorian home. She places them up against all the doors, ensuring they sit snugly against the gap between the door and floor. To find out if you have any gaps or cracks, feel for moving air, visible light and/or whistling wind in the following areas: Windows and skylights\n\nWindows and skylights Floorboards\n\nFloorboards Walls\n\nWalls Doors\n\nDoors Appliances that connect to walls\n\nAppliances that connect to walls Unused fireplaces One easy way to check for drafts in your home is to light an incense stick or candle and look for the flutter that indicates there is air movement. Even if you have seals around your windows, remember that these can degrade over time. So regularly inspect them to make sure they are in good condition. Window sealing kits are also available from your local hardware store. Unplug vampire appliances Generally, most electronic appliances \u2014 think TVs, computers and gaming consoles \u2014 tend to enter a stand-by mode rather than fully powering down. So while you are asleep or away from home, they are working behind the scenes, sucking your electricity and cash. According to Canstar Blue estimates, appliances on stand-by mode could cost you up to 10 per cent of your electricity bill. That's more than $100 annually. Use your local council's energy efficiency kits Many councils and libraries across Australia offer energy efficiency kits that residents can borrow for free to identify areas of energy waste and take steps to reduce their consumption and lower their bills. These kits typically include tools like: Thermal cameras to help you locate draughts and gaps in insulation\n\nThermal cameras to help you locate draughts and gaps in insulation Plug-in energy monitors for measuring energy consumption and the running costs of appliances\n\nPlug-in energy monitors for measuring energy consumption and the running costs of appliances Water flow measuring cups to determine the water flow rate of your taps\n\nWater flow measuring cups to determine the water flow rate of your taps Thermometer for measuring the temperature of rooms, fridges and freezers\n\nUpgrades on the pricier side\n\nIf you are looking for longer-term investments, here are a couple of home upgrades you could do.\n\nInsulation\n\nLet's start off with the savings you could make from installing insulation:\n\nCeiling: 45 per cent or more on heating costs\n\n45 per cent or more on heating costs Walls: up to 25 per cent\n\nup to 25 per cent Floors: 20 per cent\n\nCSIRO senior experimental scientist Michael Ambrose says insulation, particularly ceiling, provides \"excellent bang for buck\". But expect to pay between $1,800 to $2,800.\n\nTry and heat the person first \u2014 think socks, dressing gowns and jumpers. ( )\n\nDouble-glazed windows\n\nAccording to the Victorian government, double-glazed windows retain up to 30 per cent more heat and conditioned air than single-glazed windows.\n\nThat is because the gap between the two panes of glass acts as a barrier, slowing down the transfer of heat.\n\nIt can cost anywhere from $300 to $1,500 per square metre.\n\nIf this is out of your budget, there are some other options to consider.

        "text": "We all like to imagine we're ageing well. Now a simple blood or saliva test promises to tell us by measuring our \"biological age\". And then, as many have done, we can share how \"young\" we really are on social media, along with our secrets to success.\n\nWhile chronological age is how long you have been alive, measures of biological age aim to indicate how old your body actually is, purporting to measure \"wear and tear\" at a molecular level.\n\nThe appeal of these tests is undeniable. Health-conscious consumers may see their results as reinforcing their anti-ageing efforts, or a way to show their journey to better health is paying off.\n\nBut how good are these tests? Do they actually offer useful insights? Or are they just clever marketing dressed up to look like science?\n\nHow do these tests work?\n\nOver time, the chemical processes that allow our body to function, known as our \"metabolic activity\", lead to damage and a decline in the activity of our cells, tissues and organs.\n\nBiological age tests aim to capture some of these changes, offering a snapshot of how well, or how poorly, we are ageing on a cellular level.\n\nOur DNA is also affected by the ageing process. In particular, chemical tags (methyl groups) attach to our DNA and affect gene expression. These changes occur in predictable ways with age and environmental exposures, in a process called methylation.\n\nResearch studies have used \"epigenetic clocks\", which measure the methylation of our genes, to estimate biological age. By analysing methylation levels at specific sites in the genome from participant samples, researchers apply predictive models to estimate the cumulative wear and tear on the body.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nWhat does the research say about their use?\n\nAlthough the science is rapidly evolving, the evidence underpinning the use of epigenetic clocks to measure biological ageing in research studies is strong.\n\nStudies have shown epigenetic biological age estimation is a better predictor of the risk of death and ageing-related diseases than chronological age.\n\nEpigenetic clocks also have been found to correlate strongly with lifestyle and environmental exposures, such as smoking status and diet quality.\n\nIn addition, they have been found to be able to predict the risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTaken together, a growing body of research indicates that at a population level, epigenetic clocks are robust measures of biological ageing and are strongly linked to the risk of disease and death.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut how good are these tests for individuals?\n\nWhile these tests are valuable when studying populations in research settings, using epigenetic clocks to measure the biological age of individuals is a different matter and requires scrutiny.\n\nFor testing at an individual level, perhaps the most important consideration is the \"signal to noise ratio\" (or precision) of these tests. This is the question of whether a single sample from an individual may yield widely differing results.\n\nFive ways to improve your health and extend your lifespan Photo shows A photo of a woman wearing grey racerback top stretching, shot from behind There are no quick fixes or short cuts to living longer and healthier lives, but the science is clear on the key principles. Here are five things you can do to extend your lifespan and improve your health.\n\nA study from 2022 found samples deviated by up to nine years. So an identical sample from a 40-year-old may indicate a biological age of as low as 35 years (a cause for celebration) or as high as 44 years (a cause of anxiety).\n\nWhile there have been significant improvements in these tests over the years, there is considerable variability in the precision of these tests between commercial providers. So depending on who you send your sample to, your estimated biological age may vary considerably.\n\nAnother limitation is there is currently no standardisation of methods for this testing. Commercial providers perform these tests in different ways and have different algorithms for estimating biological age from the data.\n\nAs you would expect for commercial operators, providers don't disclose their methods. So it's difficult to compare companies and determine who provides the most accurate results \u2014 and what you're getting for your money.\n\nA third limitation is that while epigenetic clocks correlate well with ageing, they are simply a \"proxy\" and are not a diagnostic tool.\n\nIn other words, they may provide a general indication of ageing at a cellular level. But they don't offer any specific insights about what the issue may be if someone is found to be \"ageing faster\" than they would like, or what they're doing right if they are \"ageing well\".\n\nSo regardless of the result of your test, all you're likely to get from the commercial provider of an epigenetic test is generic advice about what the science says is healthy behaviour.\n\nLoading...\n\nAre they worth it? Or what should I do instead?\n\nWhile companies offering these tests may have good intentions, remember their ultimate goal is to sell you these tests and make a profit. And at a cost of around $500, they're not cheap.\n\nWhy 88 -year-old Graham\u2019s swimming group keeps him alive Photo shows Five men in swim-wear stand at the end of an outdoor swimming pool looking in different directions and smiling. This group of men, whose oldest member is 91, meet for a swim every day. They say the routine keeps their mental and physical health in check as they age.\n\nWhile the idea of using these tests as a personalised health tool has potential, it is clear that we are not there yet.\n\nFor this to become a reality, tests will need to become more reproducible, standardised across providers, and validated through long-term studies that link changes in biological age to specific behaviours.\n\nSo while one-off tests of biological age make for impressive social media posts, for most people they represent a significant cost and offer limited real value.\n\nThe good news is we already know what we need to do to increase our chances of living longer and healthier lives. These include:\n\nimproving our diet\n\nincreasing physical activity\n\ngetting enough sleep\n\nquitting smoking\n\nreducing stress\n\nprioritising social connection.\n\nWe don't need to know our biological age in order to implement changes in our lives right now to improve our health.\n\nHassan Vally is an associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin University.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It did not take long for Dolphins chief executive Terry Reader to know Kristian Woolf was the man to spearhead the NRL\u2019s newest outfit into the future. Even though the shadow of Wayne Bennett was going to loom over whoever took the reins, they knew they had their man. \u201cHe was the number one target for us at the start,\u201d Reader declared. \u201cEven with Wayne as our coach, we still had a lot of questions. He said \u2018we\u2019ll do it together, let\u2019s find the best coach, and he\u2019ll be the assistant and take over at the end\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a better transition of NRL coaches than what\u2019s happened. We weren\u2019t building a house of cards, we were setting up a club for the future.\u201d Kristian Woolf was identified as the Dolphins\u2019 long-term coach early in the piece. Credit: NRL Photos Thus far, Woolf has dared to orchestrate a miracle \u2013 overcoming four-straight defeats in the first month to have his side one-point shy of the top eight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has done so amid a concerning injury toll \u2013 one which has claimed stars Tom Gilbert, Thomas Flegler, Daniel Saifiti, Max Plath and Jack Bostock for the rest of the season. Felise Kaufusi will also be sidelined with a knee concern, while Ray Stone has been playing with two busted shoulders. Loading Given their season even began with a last-minute relocation to Sydney due Cyclone Alfred, Reader did not hesitate to claim \u201cI don\u2019t think a first-year coach has ever gone through what Kristian has\u201d. And yet, as he plots a boilover of his former mentor against South Sydney on Saturday, Woolf turned his nose up at excuses. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like what we\u2019ve had, particularly with season-ending injuries. That\u2019s footy, we\u2019re not going to get frustrated or whinge about it,\u201d Woolf said. \u201cWe need to go out with a mindset that we\u2019ll be at our best, be hard to beat and give ourselves a really good chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know how hard they worked in pre-season, I know how hard they work for each other. They haven\u2019t given me any indication that they\u2019re going to change anything because we\u2019ve lost a couple of players. \u201cIf anything, they\u2019re more committed to working hard for each other.\u201d Building his empire Barely 24 hours before the Dolphins announced Selwyn Cobbo would join the fold in 2026, Reader hinted the Broncos\u2019 flyer was not in their sights. How things can change quickly in rugby league. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those blokes that can do things other people can\u2019t. He\u2019s a guy you want in your team rather than the opposition,\u201d Woolf said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was ever no interest, it\u2019s about availability, spots and things like that. A fair bit has changed in 24 hours \u2026 there\u2019s a bit of movement all over the place and both ways for us.\u201d That movement suggests those off contract face uncertain futures, but points to Woolf assembling the squad he believes can deliver a premiership. Cobbo will be joined by St Helens lock Morgan Knowles, while Francis Molo and Sebastian Su\u2019A arrived mid-season. Flegler, Gilbert, Bostock, Plath, Saifiti, Isaiya Katoa, Jeremy Marshall-King, Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, Kulikefu Finefeuiaki and Kurt Donoghoe are signed until at least 2027, while Herbie Farnwort expressed his desire to remain. Reports also emerged England halfback George Williams could be signed, and even swapped with Kodi Nikorima. Woolf dismissed the notion. \u201cKodi Nikorima is not up for sale or going to be swapped \u2013 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing his best footy at the moment. That\u2019s one thing we wouldn\u2019t entertain.\u201d Breaking the curse Woolf tasted success before taking over from Bennett \u2013 guiding St Helens to three Super League titles while transforming Tonga into a global force. But given the history of Bennett\u2019s successors, the question was asked: could he break the Bennett curse? \u201cComing into the NRL and the expectations and toughness of the competition, there are nerves anyway,\u201d Woolf admitted. \u201cThat [replacing Bennett] can certainly add to it. I thought about all that well before I came, [but] my two years working with Wayne gave me some confidence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Warning: this story contains elements that may distress some people.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many people, reporting sexual harassment at work is not as easy as simply making a complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws are in place to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment at work, experts and victim survivors say there are still significant gaps between policy and practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the Australian Human Rights Commission says more needs to be done to support those most vulnerable to harassment at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Anna Cody is Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe tells SBS that for real change to occur, leaders have to take action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we need to see is leaders stepping up. So that's CEOs, directors of boards, managers, supervisors, but everyone within a workplace to make sure that people are safe and respected at work. And how we can then create a culture where it's not okay to not be respectful within a workplace. We need to ensure that our workplaces are diverse, that there is cultural diversity, people with disability at all levels within an organisation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission's new report, called Speaking From Experience, aims to address gaps in understanding about what workers from diverse backgrounds think needs to change to make workplaces safer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual harassment at work is a complex matter and extends beyond gender discrimination, occurring most often to those who experience various forms of overlapping disadvantage or discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Harassers definitely do choose who they are harassing though they'll choose the person who's on a temporary visa or who really needs this job and who can't afford to let it go. So they use that vulnerability as a way of protecting themselves. So workplaces and bosses and supervisors need to be conscious of that, particularly where there are systems in place or locations within a workplace. You can create safety within a workplace through systems as well as through the way in which you deal with the person who's experienced workplace sexual harassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission says one in three Australians report being sexually harassed at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure was far higher for some, with almost half [[48%]] of people with a disability experiencing harassment at work and 56 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in insecure employment, LGBTIQ+ people, culturally or linguistically diverse people, and people with a disability, are not only more likely to experience sexual harassment, but less likely to feel safe enough to report it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrabha Nandagopal is an award-winning human rights lawyer and founder of Elevate Consulting Partners, a firm that works with businesses to create safe, respectful and inclusive workplaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says leaders must be able to address their own blind spots and centre the voices of those affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" We know that sexual harassment isn't just about gender, it's about power. And people who do sit at that intersection of racism, sexism, ableism, for example, are often more exposed and less protected. And as a woman of colour, I've seen how these layers of discrimination compound when it comes to leaders, it starts with really listening even when it's uncomfortable. So I'm briefing board directors and leaders and middle management almost every day in my day job, and it's very easy for me to talk about workplace sexual harassment. But the moment you start talking about racism in the workplace, that's when there's a bit of discomfort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging changes to the national approach over the past decade and the greater responsibility placed on employers, experts say policy and practice gaps still exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing from the experience of over 300 victim-survivors of workplace sexual harassment, the report emphasises the need for people to feel safe enough to report.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, a legal obligation called Positive Duty was added to the Sex Discrimination Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the obligation, employers have a duty to eliminate and prevent, as far as possible, unlawful acts of sexual harassment at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrabha Nandagopal says she supports recommendations to impose civil penalties for companies failing to comply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The positive duty regime under the Federal Sex Discrimination Act doesn't have civil penalties attached to it. So if someone doesn't comply with the commission's compliance notice that organization can be taken to the federal court. Where the federal court can make any order it sees fit. But unlike say your work health and safety regime, the commission's enforcement powers are quite limited.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace sexual harassment also extends beyond the physical workplace: it's not only harmful psychologically but can isolate individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Shih Joo Tan is a professor of criminology at the University of Melbourne and has co-authored a series of reports on the experiences of migrant and refugee women with workplace harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says aside from uncertainty around their rights, people from diverse cultural backgrounds are often dismissed as misunderstanding Australian culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, some migrant and refugee women might be on an employer-sponsored visa, which would sit very hard for them to even report or think about reporting because they would then have to consider the consequences that it could have on their visa status or which also links to their right to remain in a country. So there's that. And also the other issue that was also mentioned in the report was that a lot of times when they do try to say that this is what happened to me, or this person had said this really horrible thing to me, often the response that they could get is that this is just a joke or this is part of the Australian culture, learn how to, you just need to learn Australian culture in that way. So it was seen as a problem on their part that there was a lack of understanding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother issue raised in the report was the lack of knowledge around different forms of harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOften mistaken as only the most blatant forms of harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace can be covert and is often dismissed as something more lighthearted.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Anna Cody says without proper understanding of what sexual harassment is, employers can't properly address it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There have been significant changes over the last decade coming out of the Me Too movement and a greater understanding of workplace sexual harassment. But we still need to build our understanding of what constitutes workplace sexual harassment. So while many people understand touching, unwanted sexual touching, to be workplace sexual harassment, we need to think about messaging of sexual content or of leering or staring at someone in a sexual way or suggesting sexual acts with that person. All of those things also constitute workplace sexual harassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report offers policymakers and organisations eleven key recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the recommendations centre around reducing barriers - barriers to information, to safety, to being heard, to accessing support, and to justice and accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tan says while many people never make a formal complaint, there were certain things people say made it easier when they did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the very first instance, most of them felt comfortable and secure with their direct supervisors. So there was immediate support from management level. The other thing was also assurance that this would not impact on their visa status or their financial security, or that they would not have to face small talk in the office, which was another thing that women had talked about as impacting on their mental wellbeing and things that they would consider as impacting on their positions. They felt like they were punished on a social level for speaking up or for complaining.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Nandagopal says employers need to take the time to understand the problems specific to their workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So firstly, it's about really understanding the nature and prevalence of sexual harassment in their workplace by speaking to their workers and consulting, particularly those from marginalised groups, not only about what they're experiencing, but asking what they need to feel safe. Then investing in real quality education and training for leaders and workers. And then ensuring their policies and reporting processes are trauma informed and culturally safe. So going beyond that tick-a-box approach to really investing in quality effective measures to prevent and respond to sexual harassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner Anna Cody says the landmark report is a crucial final step in the Commission's Respect at Work agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while there is still a long way to go as the recommendations are considered, she says it's important to appreciate the work of victim survivors in telling their stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The people that we heard from, how strong and determined they were in trying to make our workplaces fairer and safer for everyone, that they wanted to share their stories so that we could act on them and ensure that other people didn't have to go through what they had gone through.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nNayran Tabiei keeps busy in the kitchen making traditional Syrian dishes for her catering business in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this week, her thoughts were far away, worrying about her three sons in Iran\u2019s capital Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The mobile is cut, the line they cut - no news at all. My heart started to beat. I didn't sleep at all. I tried every night, every day I'm trying to message and you see 100 message in my mobile but no answer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs bombs rained down on the city, Ms Tabiei could only hope her boys - aged in their 20s \u2013 had survived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm boiling from inside because the thing - when nothing in your hand and nothing you can do. You just, y\u2019know you want to help. My heart start like where we go, what do we do? And I cannot give them any money. I cannot give them any support, even call.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Tabiei is married to an Iranian man and the couple fled Syria in 2012 with their young daughter, leaving three young sons with their grandmother in Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I make bad decision. I felt so bad. I cannot believe 14 years gone I didn't see them and it's hard for a mum to see them grown up without them beside me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving in Australia as an asylum seeker, Ms Tabiei later opened a small caf\u00e9 called Flavours of Syria, offering work and training to many, like herself, who were forcibly displaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hundreds and hundreds of asylum seekers, I help them open their business and start up. It makes me proud. I'm so happy in Australia and sharing my food and culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, just days ago, Ms Tabiei had the phonecall she hoped for \u2013 from her sons who are alive and well, having fled Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My boy called me, my heart beating - yeah good! They stay in the mountain. They took a room with their friend and when they called I am like \u2018Oh thank God, they are alive!\u2019\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Tabiei wants to reunite her family but says every effort to bring her sons here has so far failed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From the day I heard that crisis in Iran I sent all the parliament that I need help. My hearts shaken and I need my children beside me. In this moment we need help. And 14 year I didn't see them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a further loss, rising costs have also forced her to close her Syrian caf\u00e9 in Melbourne\u2019s St Kilda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's hard to pay the rent and the cost so high. Before we had plenty of girls in the kitchen, but now I cannot afford to hire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she\u2019s not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent data from credit reporting agency CreditorWatch shows that 10 per cent of all Australian hospitality businesses closed down over the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Patrick Coghlan explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are being hit from all sides. Obviously, consumer discretionary spend is down, cost of labour, cost of goods, et cetera, all increasing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom next week, a raft of new costs will add to the pressures, according to Luke Achterstraat, CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations, or COSBOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As of one July, the award rate goes up three and a half percent. The super guarantee increases by 0.5 per cent. So that's 4 per cent already on the wage stack. And don't forget, on top of that you have payroll tax.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Achterstraat says more help is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the toughest operating environment in recent memory. For a small business with revenue of up to $20 million per year, we are calling for the corporate tax rate to be slashed from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent Consumer Price Index ,or CPI, shows inflation sitting at 2.1 per cent in the 12 months to May.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreditorwatch CEO Patrick Coghlan says the new figure offers fresh hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen two rate cuts already. They're the biggest drivers of economic activity, of GDP, of spending both from consumer and commercial. And we're expecting a couple of more of those this year as well. So, the trend is certainly heading in the right direction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAny interest rate relief is too late for Ms Tabiei, who shut her caf\u00e9 to focus on a lower-cost catering business.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping busy is a labour of love, she says, and cooking distracts from other worries.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery week for a number of weeks, current and former employees of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have been blowing whistles and banging drums at a street intersection near the group's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're protesting changes to the US Department of Health now led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, saying that he has brought his long history of vaccine scepticism into his role as the nation's top health official.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the demonstrators is infectious diseases physician Peter Cegielski.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There have been rallies here every Tuesday maybe since March... The public needs to mobilise because, I mean, there's a clown show running this country and DHHS.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC protesters' appearance on the Atlanta corner this week was timed to coincide with the first meeting of the reconstituted US panel known as ACIP or the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nKennedy abruptly fired all 17 previous members earlier this month after accusing them without evidence of conflicts of interest, replacing them with seven handpicked others.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them is new Committee chair Dr Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who publicly criticised COVID-19 lockdowns and was fired from Harvard for refusing to take a COVID vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Kulldorff was one of five members at the meeting to vote for a recommendation that people aged 6 months and older get a flu vaccination only using a single dose formula which is thimerosal-free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even if the amount available in the vaccine, maybe that amount is safe - but does not amount for exposed to be exposed to mercury from other sources. So it's cumulative and there is a need. And if we care about public health we should try to minimise exposure to mercury.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason why that's important is because the panel's recommendations influence the official US immunisation schedule, determine insurance coverage for vaccines, and act as an encouragement for people to get vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThimerosal is widely used in lower income countries because they are more likely to use lower cost multidose containers that must be punctured repeatedly, raising the risk of contamination which thimerosal helps to prevent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the preservative has also been at the centre of controversies and myths about vaccines for decades, with Robert F Kennedy involved in some of that debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, when Kennedy was an environmental lawyer, he appeared on Fox 5 New York to promote a book he had published called 'Thimerosal' that alleged evidence had been covered up showing it could cause brain problems, including autism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know I've had all six of my children vaccinated. I want to see everybody taking their vaccines. We need full coverage. People don't take them (vaccines) because they no longer believe in the CDC. They can see the science.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC says it conducted nine separate studies since 2003 that found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, and that multiple scientific studies have found no evidence of a link either.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC was not given an opportunity to present evidence before the committee's vote - but Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense, an antivaccine group founded by Secretary Kennedy - did air her concerns about thimerosal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thimerosal is recognised as a developmental and reproductive toxicant, and is listed as a chemical in the California Proposition 65 list since 1990.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary Kennedy has maintained he has always just asked questions that are justifiable and necessary, arguing that the public's trust in vaccines has waned because those questions have not been answered satisfactorily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're living now in a time of upheaval, a time of popular revolt against established institutions that have lost the public trust - and that includes medicine. President Trump and I are committed to earning it back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at least two CDC staff members have left over the changes, and major medical experts and former members of the panel have also expressed concern over its reconstitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia State Senator for District 42 Elena Parent says the panel is essentially embedding false information and vaccine scepticism into national policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the very body that has guided our nation's policies for vaccines for over 60 years. And by the way, this is what everyone said when they said 'do not confirm him'. Do not confirm him as the secretary of health. Anyone who knew anything about public health and vaccines said 'no'. These guy has peddled disinformation for years. And what did they do? Fell in line behind Trump and all the rest of them and put him in. And the worst fears are now coming true with this assault on the ACIP.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Secretary's views have also received a cool reception at a Brussels fundraising dinner for the GAVI global vaccine alliance, a group that facilitates immunisations in lower-income countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a video recording played to the gathering, Kennedy cast doubt on the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines \u2014 which the World Health Organisation and other agencies have long deemed to be safe and effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also announced the US will be cutting its funding to GAVI, on the basis that they have allegedly silenced dissenting views and what he has described as legitimate questions about vaccine safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Consider the best science available even when the science contradicts established paradigms. Until that happens, the United States won't contribute more to GAVI.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGAVI says that's ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\n\nChairman of the Board Jose Manuel Barroso says the organisation has multiple safeguards and processes in place to prioritise the health and safety of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gavi is indeed a unique organisation in global health with a public-private model that has brought together national governments, donors, vaccine manufacturers, scientific institutes and grassroot organisations to vaccinate more than 1 billion children in low income and middle income countries. And I have to say that Gavi has done it always following the best scientific advice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors Without Borders is among the medical groups to say they believe countless children will die from vaccine-preventable diseases as a result of the U-S withdrawing support for Gavi.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charity\u2019s global health advocacy director, Mihir Mankad, has called it cruel and reckless to invoke misleading and inaccurate claims about vaccine safety as the pretext for cutting all global vaccine funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut GAVI says it will be able to continue much of its work, and has plenty of other willing donors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong has said in a statement that Australia is sending $386 million over five years, while European Union President Ursula von der Leyen has also committed money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today I am pleased to pledge 360 million Euros to GAVI at this summit, and this is part of a total Team Europe pledge of 2 billion Euros or even more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, back in the US, some doctors are taking matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe influential American Academy of Paediatrics boycotted A-C-I-P's first meeting in protest, saying it will now publish its own vaccine schedule for children and do so independently of the vaccine panel, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the CDC demonstrators - which include former Division of Overdose Prevention public servant, Abby Tighe - say they will keep ringing their protest bells on that Atlanta corner for as long as they can.\n\n\n\n",

I'm Biwa Kwan.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has defended the government's position on defence spending, dismissing calls from the US to lift spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP - or gross domestic product.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaders at the NATO summit this week agreed to raise their defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says the US expects countries in the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, to match the target of 5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says Australia is sticking to the current plan to lift defence spending to 2.3 per cent of GDP by 2034.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have increased our defence investment.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It did not take long for Dolphins chief executive Terry Reader to know Kristian Woolf was the man to spearhead the NRL\u2019s newest outfit into the future. Even though the shadow of Wayne Bennett was going to loom over whoever took the reins, they knew they had their man. \u201cHe was the number one target for us at the start,\u201d Reader declared. \u201cEven with Wayne as our coach, we still had a lot of questions. He said \u2018we\u2019ll do it together, let\u2019s find the best coach, and he\u2019ll be the assistant and take over at the end\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a better transition of NRL coaches than what\u2019s happened. We weren\u2019t building a house of cards, we were setting up a club for the future.\u201d Kristian Woolf was identified as the Dolphins\u2019 long-term coach early in the piece. Credit: NRL Photos Thus far, Woolf has dared to orchestrate a miracle \u2013 overcoming four-straight defeats in the first month to have his side one-point shy of the top eight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has done so amid a concerning injury toll \u2013 one which has claimed stars Tom Gilbert, Thomas Flegler, Daniel Saifiti, Max Plath and Jack Bostock for the rest of the season. Felise Kaufusi will also be sidelined with a knee concern, while Ray Stone has been playing with two busted shoulders. Loading Given their season even began with a last-minute relocation to Sydney due Cyclone Alfred, Reader did not hesitate to claim \u201cI don\u2019t think a first-year coach has ever gone through what Kristian has\u201d. And yet, as he plots a boilover of his former mentor against South Sydney on Saturday, Woolf turned his nose up at excuses. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like what we\u2019ve had, particularly with season-ending injuries. That\u2019s footy, we\u2019re not going to get frustrated or whinge about it,\u201d Woolf said. \u201cWe need to go out with a mindset that we\u2019ll be at our best, be hard to beat and give ourselves a really good chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know how hard they worked in pre-season, I know how hard they work for each other. They haven\u2019t given me any indication that they\u2019re going to change anything because we\u2019ve lost a couple of players. \u201cIf anything, they\u2019re more committed to working hard for each other.\u201d Building his empire Barely 24 hours before the Dolphins announced Selwyn Cobbo would join the fold in 2026, Reader hinted the Broncos\u2019 flyer was not in their sights. How things can change quickly in rugby league. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those blokes that can do things other people can\u2019t. He\u2019s a guy you want in your team rather than the opposition,\u201d Woolf said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was ever no interest, it\u2019s about availability, spots and things like that. A fair bit has changed in 24 hours \u2026 there\u2019s a bit of movement all over the place and both ways for us.\u201d That movement suggests those off contract face uncertain futures, but points to Woolf assembling the squad he believes can deliver a premiership. Cobbo will be joined by St Helens lock Morgan Knowles, while Francis Molo and Sebastian Su\u2019A arrived mid-season. Flegler, Gilbert, Bostock, Plath, Saifiti, Isaiya Katoa, Jeremy Marshall-King, Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, Kulikefu Finefeuiaki and Kurt Donoghoe are signed until at least 2027, while Herbie Farnwort expressed his desire to remain. Reports also emerged England halfback George Williams could be signed, and even swapped with Kodi Nikorima. Woolf dismissed the notion. \u201cKodi Nikorima is not up for sale or going to be swapped \u2013 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing his best footy at the moment. That\u2019s one thing we wouldn\u2019t entertain.\u201d Breaking the curse Woolf tasted success before taking over from Bennett \u2013 guiding St Helens to three Super League titles while transforming Tonga into a global force. But given the history of Bennett\u2019s successors, the question was asked: could he break the Bennett curse? \u201cComing into the NRL and the expectations and toughness of the competition, there are nerves anyway,\u201d Woolf admitted. \u201cThat [replacing Bennett] can certainly add to it. I thought about all that well before I came, [but] my two years working with Wayne gave me some confidence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "As multiple Sydney councils continue to grapple with the contentious problem, one is seeking a more formal way for residents to call it out.\n\nOne council is seeking more formal ways to discourage long term parking of caravans, boats and trailers. Source: North Sydney Council\n\nThe battle for our streets is heating up with one major city council now urging locals to dob in residents for leaving trailers, caravans and boats on the side of the road for extended periods of time.\n\nFor months, Sydney's Northern Beaches Council has been grappling with the issue, launching a months long investigation last last year about how best to crack down on the practice, including the potential of introducing new parking signage and rules enforcing vehicle only areas.\n\nCouncillors say residents continue to complain about boats, caravans and trailers clogging up backstreets in their suburbs, prompting them to unanimously pass a new motion at a council meeting this month to address their concerns.\n\nThe council is also preparing a submission to the NSW state government and is asking it to review the current penalties and offences under the Road Rules 2014 and Road Transport Act 2013 to enable a new permit system \"to further discourage boats and trailers being parked on residential streets\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe council also wants to implement a more formal system to encourage residents to report hotspots for \"inappropriate parking of trailers, boats and caravans\" such as creating a specific online form that would be promoted in a community newsletter and social media.\n\nMultiple local government areas around Sydney are struggling with the issue. Source: Supplied\n\nAccording to councillor Vincent De Luca, who introduced the latest motion at the council meeting, the issue has become a danger by impeding visibility for road users. \"We see large craft, obstructing vision causing accidents,\" he told the meeting.\n\nIt's been an issue simmering in the community for some time. In 2023 a boat legally parked on the street was spray-painted with the words \"f*** off\", prompting the owner to respond with a note outlining their right to leave the boat there.\n\nThe neighbours' feud began when the boat trailer was regularly parked in the 'high density' area. Source: Reddit\n\nA Northern Beaches Council spokesperson recently told Yahoo News it is one of the most complained about issues it deals with, after receiving some 288 complaints last year. In response, more streets have been fitted with \"No Parking - Motor Vehicles Excepted\" signs \u2013 which initially confused some motorists when they were first rolled out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNeighbouring councils have also struggled with the issue. Last year Randwick City Council announced it will ban parking for almost five kilometres along a busy nature strip that's become \"increasingly popular for storage of boats, caravans and trailers\".\n\nMeanwhile in the nearby suburb of Cremorne, one resident (who doesn't have a garage and has to rely on street parking) has become so fed up she started a petition calling for stricter parking rules for non cars. \"The road is there for people to use and not to store, and that is the distinction that needs to be made,\" she told Yahoo in February.\n\nIn NSW, and most other states and territories, it is legal for boats, trailers and caravans to be stationed on the street in the same spot for up to 28 days. After this, the owner will be notified and they need to be moved or risk a $660 fine.\n\nThe new location needs to be \"at least as far as a different block section of the same street\", according to guidelines.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe issue has been been exacerbated by the fact that caravan and campervan registrations across the nation have steadily grown over the part decade with more than 900,000 currently on our roads.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Source: Nick Whigham\n\nSitting at my boarding gate doomscrolling social media, I saw the worst possible alert appear in my feed.\n\nAfter Googling my flight out of Madrid the previous night to learn it was cancelled, I had already scrambled to get a new flight to Barcelona to begin my journey back home to Australia. But things were about to get really bad.\n\nSitting in Doha International Airport in Qatar with about 30 minutes left to board my Sydney-bound flight, I read a tweet saying the Qatari government had just closed the country's airspace due to imminent missile launches from Iran targeting US military bases in the country.\n\nNone of the passengers around me knew it yet \u2013 and there was certainly no announcement over the loud speaker at the airport \u2013 but we were about to find ourselves in the middle of what the airline would later call \"one of the most severe and complex operational challenges in modern aviation history\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe airport is one of the world's busiest and most connected global aviation hubs. At the time, over 90 Qatar Airways flights carrying more than 20,000 passengers to Doha, were forced to divert immediately. Inside the airport, there was some 10,000 passengers with the airline now in complete limbo.\n\nSlowly it became clear no one was going anywhere. And nobody had any answers about when we could or how exactly that would happen.\n\nRELATED: Advice to Aussie travellers heading to Europe and Middle East\n\nAt one point, passengers trying to get back to Sydney queued for hours for nothing. Source: Nick Whigham\n\nQatar Airways said it deployed extra staff to deal with the massive disruption but at the same time some of the flight crews had timed out of legal operating hours.\n\nAt one point, myself and countless other trying to get back to Sydney queued for hours on hopes of being issued a new boarding pass only for that queue to be told to disband and move further down the terminal empty handed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Someone had to step up.\"\n\nAs people grew increasingly agitated by the lack of information, things started unravelling and passengers were forced to help take control of the situation. I soon found myself standing behind the desks of frantic airline staff as a Danish passenger (who was moving to Sydney for two years) and I passed along new boarding tickets from a nearby desk where they were slowly being spat out down to the counter where a sole Qatar Airways employee was processing each new traveller.\n\nAn Australian woman, who had taken it upon herself to make a list of passenger details and bring some order to the chaos, stood next to worker at the desk facilitating the whole thing. She later told me she has such a bad back that she sometimes requires a wheelchair.\n\n\"Someone had to step up,\" she said.\n\nAs I waited for my boarding pass behind the staff desks watching the queues of desperate travellers, at one point I accidentally lent up against the door setting off an alarm. It spoke to the craziness of the moment that most people barely seemed to notice the extra noise.\n\nPassengers forced to delete videos from inside the airport\n\nWhile the Qatar Airways staff member did an incredible job, there was a severe lack of leadership on the ground and zero proactive communication to stranded customers. Some airport staff appeared more concerned about instructing passengers to delete videos they witnessed them taking of the chaotic scenes inside the airport.\n\nOnce airspace reopened shortly after midnight on Tuesday (local time) diverted aircraft began returning to the hub. In the words of Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer in a self-congratulatory statement on Thursday, \"each arrival [was] a step towards reassembling our operation.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout 36 hours after arriving in Doha, I touched down in Sydney after being one of the lucky passengers to get on the next available flight.\n\nAccording to reports, the missiles that brought the global travel hub to a halt were largely a symbolic act of retribution from Iran against US president Trump's air strikes on nuclear facilities in the country.\n\nFor some, it was another example of how perhaps no one is immune to the vicissitudes of Donald Trump's return to power and the newly unpredictable nature of the White House and its foreign policy.\n\nDue to the Trump administration's brutal border regime which is detaining and deporting people, including an Australian journalist recently, travellers have been warned about preparing themselves for difficulties when entering the US, but those travelling elsewhere can still feel his impact.\n\nIt must be said the man likes a tax. Usually on his own consumers in the form of a tariff. Trump also wants to tax foreign holders of US assets with a new law contained in the so-called 'big beautiful bill' (something that could hit your superannuation account, although Trump appeared to back away from that on Friday).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd as missiles continue to fly in the Middle East and Iran on Friday threatened to keep attacking US bases, perhaps you could call this current airspace instability a kind of Trump travel tax. Myself and countless others paid it in full this week.\n\nMany questioned how Trump's Iran bombings were compatible with his 'America first' style rhetoric.

Source: Murrindindi Ranges Wildlife Shelter\n\nWARNING \u2013 DISTRESSING VIDEO: Chances are you've seen it by the roadside. Tall, dry grass that blends into its surroundings, particularly in rural parts of Australia.\n\nBut this invasive weed, known as phalaris aquatica, is having a devastating impact on kangaroos \u2014 leaving them so sick they need to be euthanised. Roos develop what's known as the \"phalaris stagger\", a neurological condition that gives them tremors, makes them lose their balance and collapse.\n\nWildlife rescuers told Yahoo News they're seeing more cases than ever before, and are calling for more to be done.\n\n\"This is the worst phalaris season I've ever seen,\" Kate Turner, founder of Murrindindi Ranges Wildlife Shelter, said. She calls it the \"cockroach of the grass world\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKate recently found a roo and her joey suffering from 'phalaris stagger' on the side of a road. The mum was so afflicted she could barely walk and needed to be euthanised. The joey is now in Kate's care, and while she's missing her mum, she's \"doing well\".\n\nKate said the current drought conditions in the Hume region have resulted in a takeover of phalaris, as it's more hardy and will \"outgrow\" native grasses.\n\n\"That's why it's the worst this season, because it's the only grass they've got access to,\" she said.\n\nFellow rescuer Leonie Sorrentino from Wildlife Rescuers agreed that there have been \"a lot more\" cases this year.\n\nShe told Yahoo the kangaroos also get more aggressive than usual when they're affected by phalaris, which can make rescues harder and more dangerous.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"They seem to have like a superhuman strength,\" she said.\n\n\"There seems to be a ferocity to them. They're just very sensitive to touch. They growl a lot more. It's completely different to a normal rescue.\n\n\"It's really very sad and depressing to see. And of course, sometimes if we can't get close enough, we have to actually wait [to euthanise] until they get a lot worse.\"\n\nLeonie said without intervention, the roos would eventually succumb to the disease and become \u201cfox bait\u201d as they would no longer be able to outrun the predators.\n\n\"Practically everyone we attend to, we have to euthanise. It's horrific. It's a shocking way to die.\"\n\nPhalaris can grow up to 150cm tall, and easily overshadows native grasses. Source: Victorian Government/Trees for Life (SA)\n\nPhalaris widely used as a pasture crop\n\nPhalaris aquatica is commonly used as a pasture crop to feed livestock. And while the phalaris staggers can also affect farm animals, giving them cobalt or spraying it on the grass helps to protect them from the effects of the toxins.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWeed science professor at the University of Queensland Bhagirath Chauhan said phalaris is a fast-growing, resilient weed with seeds that can take a long time to germinate.\n\n\"So it means even if you can stop the seed production in this season, you will get these plants in the next three to four years, definitely,\" he said.\n\nPhalaris can grow up to 150cm tall, and it's their height that gives them an advantage over native grasses by blocking out sunlight.\n\nHe said the seeds are usually spread through water, wildlife or even by machinery used to cut the grass.\n\nBecause of its popularity in agriculture, Chauhan believes phalaris will never be eradicated but said it would make a huge difference to focus on managing its spread.\n\n\"I think we need to emphasise that we need to stop allowing it to go out of the fenced area, because otherwise it becomes a real problem,\" he said.\n\nThe joey that Kate saved has been taking a bottle and getting to know other orphans at the shelter. Source: Murrindindi Ranges Wildlife Shelter\n\nWhat's being done about the spread of phalaris?\n\nVictoria's Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action [DEECA] works with a number of agencies across the state, like VicRoads, Parks Victoria and local councils to help control phalaris.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDEECA Chief Biodiversity Officer and Director of the Arthur Rylah Institute James Todd told Yahoo each location needs to be assessed to decide how best to manage the weed.\n\n\u201cDEECA partners with Traditional Owners and government agencies to target invasive weeds including Phalaris aquatica on public land across Victoria using a range of techniques including herbicide spraying, slashing and ecological burning,\" DEECA Chief Biodiversity Officer and Director of the Arthur Rylah Institute, James Todd told Yahoo.\n\n\u201cGiven the sensitivity of some native species to spraying and inability of some sites to be treated with burning there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating weeds on public land.\u201d\n\nHow can you help?\n\nMost of the carers in Australia are volunteers who give their own time, money and petrol into saving injured wildlife.\n\nIf you would like to donate to the rescuers mentioned in this story you can find their details below.\n\nMurrindindi Ranges Wildlife Shelter\n\nAccount Name: Murrindindi Ranges Wildlife Shelter\n\nAccount Number: 159658038\n\nBSB: 633-000\n\nWildlife Rescuers\n\nTo donate to Wildlife Rescuers, click here.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
