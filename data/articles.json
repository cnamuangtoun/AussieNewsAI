It's going to cost $9 trillion. It's going to put things like Medicare at risk,\" Littleproud told Today ahead of the meeting.\n\n\"But there are alternative ways to do our bit in a fair and equitable way in terms of global emissions.\n\n\"We're not deniers, we believe in climate change.

        "text": "Many Australians now have access to cheaper visits to the doctor , after a $7.9 billion overhaul of the bulk billing system came into effect.\n\nBut not everyone gets to benefit from right away, with the government projecting it will take years for most GP practices to sign on to the scheme.\n\nSo what's actually changed, and what does it mean for you? This is what you need to know.\n\nMedicare is getting a $7.9 billion overhaul. (Justin McManus/The Age)\n\nWhat has changed for bulk billing incentives?\n\nUnder the previous system, the federal government incentivised doctors to provide bulk-billed consultations to children under 16 or patients who have a Commonwealth concession card.\n\nHowever, from Saturday, November 1, the scheme has been expanded so the incentive now covers anyone with a Medicare card.\n\nThe government has also introduced the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program (BBPIP) \u2013 an extra 12.5 per cent incentive payment to be split between doctors and practices that sign up for the program.\n\nThe changes aim to increase the proportion of GP appointments that are bulk billed. (Wolter Peeters/SMH)\n\nWhy have these changes been made?\n\nThe changes were announced in the lead-up to this year's federal election campaign .\n\nWhile it was partly a political move from the Labor government aimed at exploiting a perceived weakness of then-opposition leader Peter Dutton due to his stint as health minister, it's also aimed at addressing the declining bulk billing rate.\n\nIn 2020, the figure was sitting at a record high of 89 per cent. In 2024, it had fallen to 78 per cent (admittedly up fractionally from 77 per cent the year before).\n\nThe government says the overhaul will drive the bulk billing rate up to 90 per cent by 2030.\n\nThe policy was announced in the lead-up to this year's federal election. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nSo does this mean free GP visits for (almost) everyone?\n\nThat's the idea \u2013 the government wants as many Australians as possible to access free doctor appointments.\n\nIn practice, it's going to take a while for GPs across the country to sign on to the new scheme , although the government insists it's happy with the uptake so far.\n\nA few days out from its introduction, more than 1000 practices had indicated they would move to full bulk billing from November 1.\n\nTo hit its 90 per cent bulk billing rate target, the government in February said it needs 4800 practices on board (although about 1600 were already fully bulk billing before the changes came into effect).\n\nThat leaves a shortfall of about 2200 to close over the next few years.\ufeff\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler is confident, though, that more providers are going to join.\n\n\"They're going through those numbers, obviously making their own assessment about whether the practice will be better off and whether general practitioners, the GPs that work in their practice, will be better off,\" he told reporters the Monday before the scheme started.\n\n\"Already a couple of thousand of them have indicated that they're going to do that.\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says doctors will be better off under the changes. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"Now, a number of them are already bulk-billing practices but\u2026 almost a thousand of them are practices that this week are charging gap fees, but they've indicated next week they'll be fully bulk billing.\n\n\"I expect there to be a significant number of practices that make that same communication to us over the course of this week before Saturday as well.\"\n\nHe also said he expects the numbers to rise over the coming years and that he was \"delighted\" at the initial level of support.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia Post reveals deadline for mailing Christmas parcels \ufeff\n\nWhat does it mean for doctors?\n\nGPs weren't particularly happy with the 12.5 per cent BBPIP payment being split between doctors and practices, claiming it favours larger corporate clinics and could be a barrier to some providers signing up.\n\nHowever, the government says doctors will be financially far better off under the new system.\n\n\"Two years ago, a full-time, fully bulk-billing GP would have been earning about $280,000 a year after they paid their practice costs,\" Butler said.\n\n\"From this weekend, they'll be earning $405,000 a year, a $125,000 increase.\n\n\"This investment is obviously good for the Medicare system, good for patients, but it's also good for GPs themselves.\"",

        "text": "If you're bamboozled by the talk of e-bikes, e-motorbikes and rules around them, you're not alone.\n\nPart of this confusion is because road rules and bike laws are set by the states, meaning there's no one national law that applies to the entire country.\n\n\"Welcome to the regulatory swamp,\" Geoffrey Rose, Adjunct Professor in Transport Engineering at Monash University, says.\n\nHe says the waters are very muddy when it comes to regulations in this space.\n\nHere's a quick wrap of what each jurisdiction says about e-bikes.\n\nWhat is an e-bike?\n\nAn e-bike is an electric bicycle.\n\nThink of a normal bicycle with foot pedals, but with an electric component to assist with pedalling.\n\nThe specific definitions differ from state to state \u2014 more on that below \u2014 which makes things a little confusing.\n\nAdding to this is the different terminology floating around out there.\n\nPedals are an essential part of e-bikes. ( )\n\nFor example, regulations refer to a 250-watt bike that complies with a European Committee for Standardisation code \u2014 but some state websites use the spelling \"pedalec\", while others use the spelling \"pedelec\".\n\nAnd then there's a slightly different type of bike that also goes by different names.\n\nVictoria refers to an Electrically Power-Assisted Cycle (EPAC) on its website, while Western Australia refers to a Power Assisted Pedal Cycle (PAPC).\n\nThese bikes generally have a motor with up to 200 watts.\n\nWhat is an electric motorbike?\n\nThey're in the same class of motorbikes you see riding on the road with cars and trucks.\n\nThe only difference is that, instead of being powered by a petrol motor, they're powered by electricity.\n\nTeenager dead after electric dirt bike crash A teenage boy has died overnight after falling from an electric dirt bike in Broadbeach.\n\n\"Rules for electric-powered motorcycles are the same as for internal combustion engine motorcycles,\" an ACT government spokesperson said.\n\n\"They must be registered, the rider must be licensed, wear a helmet and obey all the relevant road rules.\"\n\nBecause an electric motor might be smaller than its petrol counterpart, some models can be quite slim and look similar to an electric bicycle \u2014 but that doesn't make it an e-bike.\n\n\"A broad range of devices are considered electric motorcycles,\" a Queensland government spokesperson said.\n\nThis includes things like electric dirt bikes that can only be conditionally registered, as well as \"illegal devices\" that can't be ridden in public places.\n\nElectric motorcycles, like this electric dirt bike, are different to e-bikes.

Source: South Australian government Tasmania Currently in Tasmania, two types of e-bikes are permitted. They are regulated based on the power of the motor and the speed at which electrical assistance stops. Both are bikes that are pedalled and assisted by an electric motor. Power-assisted pedal cycles: Limited to 200 watts, and they are primarily propelled through pedalling with an auxiliary motor. Electrically power-assisted bicycles: Limited to 250 watts where power assistance is progressively reduced as travel speed increases above 6kph and the power assistance cuts off when the speed of the e-bike exceeds 25kph, or 6kph where the cyclist is not pedalling. E-bikes that do not meet these requirements would be regulated as motorbikes and can still be used on-road if the rider is licensed and the e-bike is registered, or they can be used on private property without licensing or registration. Source: Tasmanian government spokesperson Victoria Victoria allows the use of the following e-bikes on public roads and road-related areas: E-bike type Detail Electrically power-assisted cycle (EPAC) EPACs are the most common type of e-bike available today. They have: at least one auxiliary propulsion motor\n\na maximum continuous rated power of 250 watts\n\na motor that provides power assistance when the rider is pedalling, and only up to 25kph\n\na motor that does not provide power at speeds higher than 25kph They cannot be propelled by a throttle (except up to 6kph \u2014 sometimes referred to as \"walk mode\"). Power-assisted bicycles with a power output of 200 watts or less. This category includes power-assisted pedal cycles which are not commonly available in Australian retailers anymore. E-bikes in this category must not produce a combined maximum ungoverned continuous rated power output of more than 200 watts. Due to their lower power output these bicycles have less stringent requirements compared to an EPAC, and exist primarily to allow legacy devices. \"You could get a significant penalty if you ride a bicycle with a power output above these limits,\" Victoria's bike law booklet says. \"Motorised bicycles that go above these power outputs might be categorised as motorcycles even if they look like a bicycle.\" The following bikes can only be ridden on private property: E-bikes with toggle switches which allow the bike to override the legal power and wattage limits outlined above\n\nAn EPAC that continues to provide motorised power above 25kph\n\nAny bicycle with a combined maximum continuous rated power output greater than 250 watts\n\nA device with no functional pedals\n\nA bicycle fitted with an internal combustion engine (eg petrol-powered) They are considered an unregistered motor vehicle and heavy fines apply for riding in public areas.

This includes any bike that: Is mostly designed to be \"driven\" by the motor instead of using human power\n\nCan be ridden using a throttle alone (no human power)\n\nHas a motor or motors with a power output higher than 250 watts And Western Australia has age limits on e-bikes, saying \"riders must be at least 16 years old to ride an eBike with the motor engaged\". Source: WA government\n\nWhy is it so confusing?\n\nPart of this is because there isn't one standard definition of an e-bike in state laws.\n\nTo understand why that is, we need a bit of a history lesson in modes of transport.\n\n\"Some time ago, we had our own regulations for a power-assisted bicycle (PAB),\" Professor Rose says.\n\n\"The idea was to define a vehicle which has motor assistance but in terms of the road rules would be regarded as a 'bicycle' and therefore not needing to be registered or insured or for the rider to have a license.\n\n\"In those old days, there were internal combustion engines which could be fitted to bikes to turn them into a power-assisted bike.\n\n\"To be regarded as a PAB, the old rules said that the motor had to be less than 200 watts.\n\n\"Those PABs were allowed to be throttle-controlled and the motor could not enable them to travel above 25 kph (from memory).\"\n\nBut this definition didn't match up with what the global e-bike marketplace was offering.\n\nE-bike is a simple umbrella term for bicycles with electric motors, but the legal definitions get quite technical. ( )\n\n\"A number of years ago there was an epiphany that having a regulation which was different from just about everywhere else in the world meant we saw very, very few PABs in the marketplace here and very little update,\" Professor Rose said.\n\n\"The idea emerged to adopt the European Standard for an EPAC \u2014 electrically power-assisted bicycle.\n\n\"Because there were still PABs about, both definitions were retained (PAB and EPAC) and it was OK so long as a bike met one or other set of the criteria.\n\n\"Part of the confusion today is because of that grandfathered provision to retain reference in parts to PAB.\n\n\"That adoption of the European standard meant that there was a broader range of models which could be imported and, as anticipated, that meant that adoption of e-bikes grew.\"\n\nE-bikes have electronic motors that assist with pedalling. ( )\n\nCheck before you buy\n\nJust because some bikes are legal, doesn't mean every e-bike for sale meets state requirements.\n\nHere's a warning from the Western Australian government that speaks to that:\n\n\"Not all electric bicycles sold in WA are legal to ride on WA roads and paths,. \"Always check before you buy.\"\n\nCan you ride an electric bike on the road?\n\nYes.\n\nE-bikes can be legally ridden on the road like a normal bike \u2014 but only if those bikes meet the definitions we mentioned above.\n\nRiders have to follow the same road rules as cyclists.\n\nCan you ride an e-bike on a footpath?\n\nIf your e-bike meets the requirements above, it's essentially treated like a regular bicycle.\n\nSo, to find out if you can ride an e-bike on footpaths, you have to look at the rules for bicycles.\n\nMost allow all riders of all ages to cycle on footpaths.\n\nBut Victoria and New South Wales have age limits.\n\nIn Victoria, only children aged 12 and younger can ride on the footpath, without exception.\n\nThat changes to children under 16 if you're in New South Wales.\n\nTap the boxes below to see what each state and territory says about cyclists on footpaths.\n\nACT In the ACT, a cyclist may ride on shared paths and footpaths.

(ABC News: Olivia Mason)\n\nAdvisory firm McGrathNichol was brought in to assess the books and stabilise the company.\n\nLater, the federal government provided a further $4.4 million to keep the operation working as the hunt for a buyer continued.\n\nWhile the news of Bedford's financial woes was a shock for many, it was not a surprise to some.\n\nBedford buyer sought as extra funding boost allocated Australia's second-largest disability employment provider Bedford will be kept afloat by a federal government funding injection as it seeks a buyer for the embattled business.\n\nMany in the sector had been watching the company closely, including Orana.\n\n\"Most of the providers in SA in particular are really quite small, so they're always waiting to see what some of the larger providers are going to do before they make any decisions or policy shift in the way that they manage their work,\" Orana's acting chief executive officer, Nicholas Mihalaras, explained.\n\nBedford had embarked on an ambitious five-year master plan to transform and set up social enterprises aimed at offering more work choices including open employment, where people living with a disability work in mainstream settings.\n\nThe transition involved a $45 million joint venture to build what was touted to be the nation's largest social enterprise hub in Adelaide's northern suburb of Salisbury, involving manufacturing and food and beverage supplies.\n\nBedford Group had been building a large social enterprise hub in Adelaide's north. (ABC News: Will Hunter)\n\nConstruction began in 2023, but since the July announcement, the facility's future is in doubt.\n\n\"It was a fairly brave and risky move, but they were large enough to probably take on that sort of a challenge,\" Mr Mihalaras said.\n\n\" Some people were quite encouraged by what Bedford was doing. They thought it was quite entrepreneurial, even though it was risky. \"\n\n'A tall ask'\n\nThe transition to a social enterprise model is a conversation dominating supported employment in the disability sector.\n\nThere's a national push for providers like Bedford and Orana to pay award wages and to transform to offer inclusive, open employment in mainstream workplace settings.\n\nThis push was backed by the Disability Royal Commission, which recommended the federal government provide a transition plan for supported employers.\n\nNicholas Mihalaras is the acting CEO of Orana. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nBut there's scepticism about how transitioning to social enterprise will work in an already competitive market and in an environment where the federal government is yet to provide a clear framework for navigating a transformation.\n\n\"Organisations for the last 20, 30, 40 years in disability have spent a lot of energy, because we think it's the right thing to do, to try to get people into open employment,\" Mr Mihalaras said.\n\n\"I've seen several models around the world where this has been attempted and I haven't seen a successful model where intellectual disability has been integrated or transitioned successfully into open employment.\n\n\"People with intellectual disabilities need ongoing support. We have to compete against private organisations that do the same sort of work.\n\n\" It's a pretty tough market, even for employers to survive. So yeah, I think it's a tall ask. \"\n\nAnd it's an ask in a volatile environment, with the latest State of the Disability Sector report painting a dire picture of providers in financial crisis.\n\nMichael Perusco says organisations across the broader sector are doing it tough. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)\n\nMichael Perusco is the chief executive officer of advocacy group National Disability Services (NDS).\n\nHe said organisations across the broader sector were doing it tough.\n\n\"Fifty per cent of quality providers are losing money, the rest are hardly breaking even,\" he said.\n\n\"And when I say quality providers, I mean providers that have decades of experience, that are supporting people with complex needs.\"\n\nMr Perusco said that disability providers \"right across the country are under financial strain, extreme financial strain\".\n\n\"We know that 21 per cent of providers are looking to exit the market and we know that there is very low confidence within the provider market about things changing,\" he said.\n\nBut government data showed in the June quarter there were 215,779 active providers delivering services through the NDIS \u2014 up from 167,409 in the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nThe NDS points the finger at pricing and inefficiencies under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).\n\n\"There's a one-size-fits-all approach to pricing, which means that you get the same price for supporting someone with very complex needs as you do for taking someone shopping,\" Mr Perusco said.\n\n\" There are a lot of opportunities to improve the way it works, and that will lead to better value for money in the scheme and ensure that quality providers remain. \"\n\nMr Perusco says disability providers across the country are \"under financial strain\". (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)\n\nOrana's Nicholas Mihalaras agrees, and raised the option of \"policy that's more targeted to the population it's dealing with, or its funding \u2014 rather than having a practice or a policy that encompasses everybody with a disability\".\n\n\"There's a lot more energy and effort that needs to go into people with intellectual disabilities from a support point of view and I don't think that that is adequately recognised,\" he said.\n\nThe NDS said there were some positive signs.\n\n\"We're encouraged by the government's signals around independent pricing and regulatory reform. We think it's essential that our pricing is independent, that it is done in a rigorous way and it's tiered,\" Mr Perusco said.\n\nThe former federal minister for disability, who is now the federal opposition's spokesperson on the issue, is South Australian senator Anne Ruston.\n\nShe said federal and state governments shouldered responsibility.\n\n\"NDIS is an amazing program,\" Senator Ruston said.\n\n\"Perhaps it could have been better designed, but it certainly is something that we can all be very proud of.\n\n\"But what we've ended up with is a stoush between the federal government and the states and territories about who's going to be paying for what, and at the end of the day that stoush is having terrible negative consequences and impacts on Australians who live with disabilities.\"\n\nAnne Ruston says the NDIS is 'something that we can all be very proud of'. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nOn the eve of an expected announcement on the future of Bedford Group, there are calls for the federal government to provide a clear road map for organisations supporting those with complex needs.\n\n\"Something's got to happen about the way that the system is operating to allow people to survive, and unless that changes, it's not a very bright future for most organisations in this space,\" Mr Mihalaras said.\n\n\" It would be a shame to see the industry extinguished over a period of time because I think it does give people with an intellectual disability a taste of just normal life. \"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for NDIS Minister Jenny McAllister said the federal government was \"taking active steps to support provider viability and to strengthen the NDIS market\".\n\n\"This includes providing $45 million in funding for the quality supports pilots in therapy supports, supported independent living and support coordination,\" they said.\n\nThe spokesperson also said the government was working closely with Bedford and advisor McGrathNicol as \"arrangements are made for its long term future\".\n\n\"Our focus is on maintaining continuity of care and minimising disruption for participants,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWorkers at Orana handle snack packs of chips on a busy production line.

I used to spend every day there before and after school and even on Sundays. That will never leave my memory, Pioneer Park,\" Brown said.\n\nOthers might be content with watching and making the occasional bet. Not so, Ethan Brown.\n\nEthan Brown (right) rode Smokin' Romans to victory at Flemington Racecourse in 2022. (Getty Images: Vince Caligiuri)\n\nHe took his passion for horseracing to another level.\n\n\"I made a big commitment at a young age to move out of home,\" Brown said.\n\nTough journey\n\nAt the age of 15, he went to Melbourne to become an apprentice jockey.\n\nBeing 1,900 kilometres from home at such an early age was tough.\n\n\"It was a bit of a struggle there for a bit, but I stuck at it,\" Brown said.\n\nSo far, with great success.\n\nHis achievements this season follow a bumper run of six Group 1 wins last season.\n\n\"I am not saying I fluked it. I just got on that roll. And I had very good people behind me, with Ciaron [Maher] and the likes,\" Brown said.\n\nMaher trained Gold Trip, the 2022 Melbourne Cup winner.\n\nThe trainer has had a profound influence on Brown and a constant in his career.\n\nCiaron Maher convinced Ethan Brown to return to racing after an accident. (Supplied: Ethan Brown)\n\nWithout Maher's encouragement, Brown would not have returned to racing after he suffered a severe fall that almost ended his career and his life two years ago.\n\nIn the 2023 Australian Guineas at Flemington, with 300 metres to go, he fell off his horse Maximilius and was transported to hospital for emergency surgery.\n\nHe was out of the game for six months.\n\nIt made him question his career and his future in the sport.\n\n\"There was definitely a stage where I was at the crossroads. I injured myself quite badly,\" Brown said.\n\n\"I thought, 'Is it even worth coming back?'\"\n\nBut then, he spoke to Ciaron Maher. That changed everything.\n\n\"It's the best job in the world. He goes, 'You are mad if you don't go back,'\" Brown said.\n\nEthan Brown is one of the top jockeys in the Victorian standings this season. (Supplied: Ethan Brown)\n\nBrown returned to horseracing last year, working mostly with Maher.\n\nIt has been a fruitful partnership.\n\nWinning run to Cup\n\nJust over two weeks ago, Brown rode Maher-trained Jimmysstar to an impressive third place at the Everest at Randwick.\n\nHe said it was \"an amazing thrill\".\n\n\"It was such a big build-up and a bit of pressure,\" he said.\n\nNow he is going even bigger, and once again with a horse trained by Maher.\n\nOn Tuesday, he rides Middle Earth, trained by his mentor.\n\nBut Brown is trying to manage expectations.\n\nSpeaking of the six-year-old gelding from England, he said, \"he's been running well without winning in this group\".\n\nBut Brown thinks the conditions suit the mount.\n\n\"There is a bit of rain forecast that will add to his chances, so you will see the best on him on Tuesday,\" he said.\n\nWhatever the outcome at Flemington, it is difficult to disagree with the young hoop when he says: \" I am definitely happy with what I have achieved to this date.\"",

        "text": "A local government move to designate short-stay rentals as commercial properties has raised questions over whether such properties should be treated as businesses.\n\nThe City of Mount Gambier, in the South Australia's South East, has proposed designating short-term accommodation properties as commercial properties, rather than residential.\n\nIt would mean a steep rate rise for owners if the changes passed, with commercial rates to be set at 250 per cent of residential properties at the start of the 2026\u201327 financial year.\n\nMount Gambier is South Australia's second-largest city and the main economic centre of the Limestone Coast region. (ABC South East SA: Bec Whetham)\n\nThis would fall to 200 per cent across the next three years as part of a wider move to lower rates for businesses in the town.\n\nCouncil corporate and regulatory services general manager Jane Fetherstonhaugh said it was a fair way to recognise the properties' profit-earning ability.\n\n\"These properties operate as a commercial enterprise,\" she said.\n\n\"They generate income and place higher demand on infrastructure and social services, similar to any hotel or motel.\n\n\"This change just ensures some fairness on how rates are applied across those different types of accommodation providers.\"\n\nThe City of Mount Gambier, like many councils in Australia, does not know how many short-stay rentals there are in its jurisdiction. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic/Illustration)\n\nThe commercial rate would only apply to properties rented out for more than half the year and where more than 50 per cent of the property was used for short-stay accommodation.\n\n\"We don't think it's going to impact the tourism sector,\" Ms Fetherstonhaugh said.\n\nThe council's proposed changes are open for public consultation.\n\n'Money grab'\n\nShort-stay rental owner Jenny Bickley said the proposal would result in increased costs for owners, which would be passed on to customers.\n\nShe said the move was a \"money grab\".\n\n\"There will be people that either sell or the pricing will just go up,\" Ms Bickley said.\n\n\"You don't make that much money and you have to put your prices up straight away and that's going to negatively affect all the tourism we have.\"\n\nMs Bickley said council's reasoning that short-term rentals were making a profit was unfair.\n\nJenny Bickley says the short-stay sector plays a role in tourism and providing housing for transient workers.

(Supplied: City of Onkaparinga)\n\nLocal Government Association of South Australia metropolitan committee chair Moira Were said it was a welcome move that would help councils set rules for the sector.\n\n\"What we're looking at here is people who are using their properties as a permanent form of income,\" she said.\n\n\"If that is the case, even if it's just seasonal, councils want to know what's going on.\n\n\" It's not just for economic reasons, it's also for social cohesion. \"\n\nShort Term Accommodation Association of Australia executive director Keiran Craig-Jones said she was supportive of a comprehensive register of properties.\n\nShe said councils classing short-stay rentals as businesses was another example of inconsistent rules for owners.\n\nKeiran Craig-Jones says consistent rules for the sector are needed. (Supplied: Keiran Craig-Jones)\n\n\"It's not about it being fair or not, it's about the inconsistency in how our industry is currently being classified and defined,\" Ms Craig-Jones said.\n\n\"If you look at the terminology or class we're defined as at a local government area versus state and federally, it's completely different.\n\n\"It just causes confusion.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nShe bought six derelict houses in a rundown part of New Orleans and converted them into art spaces.\n\nShe spray-painted one entirely white. Fallen trees in the yard and piles of rubbish were blasted white too, an attempt, she says, to \"create order on what was hopelessly chaotic\".\n\nKirsha bought six derelict houses in New Orleans and converted them into art spaces. (Supplied)\n\nIt was an artwork as well as a place for artists to exhibit and people were intrigued. Prestigious publications such as the New York Times came knocking.\n\n\"There was a buzz,\" she says.\n\nHiding in a bunker called MONA\n\nThe buzz followed her when she moved to Hobart \u2014 but not in a good way.\n\nThe derelict properties had a form of tax, known as liens, attached to them. Kirsha maintains that because she was not renovating them as houses but using them for art, she was not liable for the tens of thousands of dollars in liens, something she claims to have successfully argued at city hall.\n\nBut when she left New Orleans and word got out the liens were unpaid, it hit the media.\n\n\"Suddenly, I was this terrible tax dodger hiding in a bunker called MONA,\" Kirsha says.\n\nKirsha had a daughter with David in 2015. (Australian Story: Simon Winter)\n\nLife in Australia was not off to a great start. Her ego was bruised and she felt a loss of identity, cringing at being considered David's \"arm-candy\".\n\nBut she was in love and wanted a child.\n\n\"I just really wanted to be a mother, and I really just had to do it,\" Kirsha says.\n\nIn 2015, the couple welcomed a daughter.\n\nSupreme Court rules on Ladies Lounge\n\nKirsha sashayed into the tribunal room last year with a sea of female supporters, all in navy suits and red lipstick, all channelling the dancers from the music video to Robert Palmer's classic 1980s hit Simply Irresistible.\n\nIt was the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal hearing into NSW man Jason Lau's complaint that his exclusion from the Ladies Lounge was discriminatory on the basis of gender \u2014 and Kirsha was thrilled to be there.\n\nThe Ladies Lounge entourage leaving the Supreme Court after an appeal hearing in September last year. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\n\"I just think it was perfect that it landed where it landed,\" Kirsha says.\n\n\"With the people and not locked up in a museum.\"\n\nZavros says Kirsha \"spun it into her web of performance and it became art, it became theatre\".\n\nThe world's media lapped it up. Age-old questions about equality and women's rights were highlighted in a fresh way, \"difficult questions but [asked] playfully and lovingly\".\n\nThe Supreme Court backed Kirsha's right to ban men from the Ladies Lounge. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nKirsha says the Ladies Lounge had a dual purpose: to give women a place to relax together and to show men how women have felt \"for millennia\" when excluded.\n\n\"[For men to be] turned away at the concierge desk is the experience, is the work,\" she says.\n\nShe lost the discrimination case, which meant more publicity \u2014 exactly what she'd hoped for.\n\n\"It was a dream,\" Kirsha says.\n\nThe Supreme Court would later rule in her favour, but not before the great Picasso scandal broke.\n\nPicasso estate responds to MONA's faked artworks The Picasso estate contacted MONA to express its regret about its faked Picassos.\n\nRather than let men into the lounge, Kirsha closed it and put the Picassos in MONA's female toilets, a place where the law allows discrimination.\n\nThe gall of exhibiting such precious art, notably by a renowned misogynist, in the loos gained more publicity \u2014 and the probing eye of Picasso's estate.\n\nTurns out, the Picassos were fake, painted by Kirsha. The fakes had been in the Ladies Lounge for three years and seven months \u2014 one of them hung upside down \u2014 and no-one had twigged.\n\nIt caused another media storm, and another iteration of the art, albeit with legal heat from the estate and reported disapproval from David about the damage the display of fake art might do to MONA's reputation.\n\nIt took more than three years for the fake Picassos to be discovered. (Supplied: MONA)\n\nBut, says her friend Muldoon: \"Fake Picassos in the toilets \u2014 this is just grand wickedness and it's brilliant. I mean, what's not to love?\"\n\nA thorny dispute\n\nIn Kirsha's world, boundaries are there to be crossed.\n\nIt's one reason she decided to apply her creative flair to perhaps Tasmania's most polarising issue \u2014 native forest logging.\n\nKirsha is trying to bring loggers and conservationists together in Tasmania. (Supplied)\n\n\"I felt hatred was preventing forward movement,\" Kirsha says.\n\n\"And I thought, 'What better way to melt hatred than through art?'\"\n\nIn 2023, she invited loggers and conservationists to MONA for a Forest Economics Congress, plying the disparate guests with art, tequila and workshops.\n\n\"We should get smashed with someone who doesn't agree with us so we can actually hash it out,\" she says.\n\nIt was a wild three days but reviews are mixed about what was achieved. Some conservationists believe Kirsha, who considers herself a greenie, is now too close to loggers, but she counters that \"everyone lobbies in their own way\".\n\nThe three-day Forest Economics Congress was held at MONA in 2023. (Supplied)\n\nOthers questioned whether the US import could make a difference. But Landcare Tasmania CEO Peter Stronach says Kirsha has facilitated conversations between the two opposing groups, and that's no small feat.\n\n\"With her position, with her creative brain, with her influence of power to talk with all sides, I think she's perfectly situated to be able to make some serious change,\" Stronach says.\n\nThe darling of the art world?\n\nExactly what Kirsha's next artistic project will be is unclear, but lately she's been dabbling with creating characters based on her extraordinary life. She acts them out in full costume: a Catholic nun from her Guam school days and a hippie called Sunfeather.\n\nKirsha uses costumes to help tell her story. (Supplied)\n\nThen there's Hans Richter, a snooty German curator who embodies the serious art world. Kirsha lets him loose to mock her desire to be welcomed into that club.\n\n\"She is darling of the art world?\" Hans/Kirsha asks incredulously in a thick German accent.\n\n\"Nein, nein. I think she's the nightmare of the art world. No-one takes her very seriously.\"\n\nShe does it well. Self-deprecating, funny and rocking a goatee beard.\n\nBut as always with Kirsha Kaechele, the question is: is it art?\n\nWatch Australian Story's 'It's my pARTy', 8:00pm, on ABCTV and ABC iview.",

        "text": "More than 65,000 Australians are expected to benefit from cheaper access to a medicine for chronic kidney disease recently added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).\n\n\n\n\n\nJardiance, also known as Empagliflozin, is a medication that can slow kidney damage over time and help preserve kidney function for longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says it's a life-changing drug for many Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Last year, we listed Jardiance for a limited group of Australians with a particular type of kidney disease. But from Saturday, we think another 70,000 Australians with kidney disease will become eligible for this life-changing drug,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, around 1 per cent of the Australian population is living with kidney disease, with one in twenty Australians aged 75 and above being diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\n\n'It's gonna make a big difference'\n\nPeter Brown, who was diagnosed with kidney disease two years ago and has been relying on medication to improve his condition, said he was pleased to learn his upcoming medication bill can be cheaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's gonna make a big difference, and the fact that $7.70 is a big difference when you work it out over 12 months,\" said Brown, referring to the concession-card rate for a single script of Jardiance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor eligible patients without a concession card, a script now costs $31.60. From next year, the price will be further lowered to $25.\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says Jardiance, also known as Empagliflozin, is life-changing for many Australians. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Butler said kidney disease was a silent epidemic in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think more than two and a half million Australians have kidney disease, but less than 10 per cent of them know about it, because the signs and symptoms of kidney disease usually only become apparent when it's as much as 90 per cent of loss of kidney function has already taken place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Carol Pollock, the chair of Kidney Health Australia, also stresses the importance of conducting health checks to detect the asymptomatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To pick up kidney disease, what we really need is a blood test, a blood pressure check and a urine test. And some people will have some of these tests done, but not always together, and we really need the three of them to be done,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And what we would like to see is a kidney health check that meant that people would have those things done and then have an understanding of what the risk the kidney disease could be and allow it to be appropriately treated.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nTikysha Thomas lives in social housing in the UK with her 14 year-old daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\ner home is covered in mould, with dirty water dripping down the walls, and mould spores embedded in almost every surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the period of 2,3 years, it's become this where both, two ceilings have collapsed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Thomas says she's reported the condition of her home to the landlord numerous times, but there has been no improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany housing associations say they don't have the money to carry out the renovations - but Ms Thomas is reaching the end of what she can cope with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really tough...sorry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTikysha's experience is not unique.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BBC reports that 1.3 million dwellings across England - or five percent of total properties - had problems with damp in at least one room in 2023, which means more than a million children have lived in damp households.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them was the Abdullah family - and their experience was ultimately one that ended in tragedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaisal Abdullah's 2 year old son Awaab Ishak developed respiratory failure and ultimately died after inhaling the black mould in his parents' flat in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily lawyer Kelly Darlington read a statement from the family after the inquest that said Faisal had been unable to get his housing association - Rochdale Boroughwide Housing - to act on the problems in his social housing several years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We felt like we were getting nowhere, and we weren't. Often our calls weren't even answered.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of the inquest, coroner Joanne Kearsley had said there was little doubt that the tragic death of Awaab Ishak should be a defining moment for the housing sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the UK government has enacted a new law that makes landlords responsible for investigating any potential emergency hazard within 24 hours of being made aware of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive of the National Housing Federation, Kate Henderson, has said in a statement that her organisation fully supports it - and has already been making an effort to improve things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since 2020 housing associations have increased spending on repairs and maintenance by 55%, with plans to spend a further \u00a350bn over the next five years. This is why 90% of our homes meet the decent homes standard, more than all other tenures.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law is named after Faisal's son.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK's Housing Secretary Steve Reed says the first phase of the law requires landlords to investigate other hazards and and confirm them within 10 days, while work to remedy the problem must begin within 12 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(If) Landlords don't meet the requirements of the new legislation they'll find themselves in the dock in court. And they face enforcement action or a fine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther legislation is expected in the next couple of years to cover the safety of homes in the private rented sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Reed has told Sky News that more of Awaab\u2019s Law will be phased in next year and in 2027 to make homes safer from more hazards, alongside work to build 1.5 million new properties, including what he has described as the biggest boost of social and affordable housing in a generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want everybody, whatever kind of property they're renting, to have the assurance that what happens to little Awaab cannot happen to anyone else... You know, Awaab's Law coming into force today is such an important step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeley has already identified some issues - what he's called pinch points where there could be challenges as social landlords meet their obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there must be an ethical internal complaints procedure that offers opportunities for genuine apologies, and clear and enforceable timeframes as issues are resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Wellingborough, a family is being moved back into their house which has been cleaned of mould.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN 1: \"Are you happier now?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN 2: \"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the new law has come too late for his family, Abdullah still hope the first round of the new law will do some good, especially for families like these.\n\n\n\n",

It simply wasn't necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 35-year-old is the principal of a M\u0101ori immersion primary school in Tauranga \u2014 on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island \u2014 where the centuries-old practice of facial tattoos is deeply understood and accepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're in a new world,\" Hona tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would go against every principle, every value of our kura , of our school, if they were to question it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis experience is a marked departure from that of his parents and grandparents, who grew up at a time when the practice was far less accepted \u2014 and when M\u0101ori culture itself was often suppressed in schools rather than celebrated.\n\n\n\nHira Hona says he and his wife Kiri sped up their journey after encouragement from the late M\u0101ori King Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII. Source: Supplied / Atawhai Hunapo Hona says he and his wife spent three years having \"hard conversations\" about whether they were ready to receive facial tattoos \u2014 a sacred practice for M\u0101ori. When they finally did, in an intimate ceremony, \"it was almost like another marriage\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you rise up again into your mataora, you're reborn,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMataora is the name given to facial tattoos worn by M\u0101ori men, which can cover half or all of the face. M\u0101ori women receive moko kauae , a distinctive marking on the chin that can extend to the lips.\n\n\n\n\n\nM\u0101ori tattoos, or t\u0101 moko, are typically drawn freehand by an artist in consultation with the recipient, who will incorporate the recipient's ancestry and story into the design.\n\n\n\n\n\nT\u0101 moko have become increasingly visible since the late 1980s, along with other expressions of M\u0101ori culture and language, following years of cultural suppression under colonisation.\n\n\n\nToday, many M\u0101ori view moko as a way to embrace and express identity and reclaim culture \u2013 and, for some, as a symbol of resistance against a government accused of pushing policies that erode M\u0101ori culture and rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a reminder to the government that we're still here. You can throw stones. You can throw all you want at us, but at the end of the day, you can't get rid of us,\" Hona says.\n\n\n\nA sacred art suppressed\n\nFor centuries before European settlement, M\u0101ori in New Zealand were telling stories, marking milestones and accomplishments, and representing their whakapapa (genealogy) through intricate t\u0101 moko etched on their faces and bodies using uhi chisels and natural inks.\n\n\n\n\n\nNgarino Ellis, a M\u0101ori art historian and professor at the University of Auckland, explains: \"Different people in our communities would receive it in different places to mark different events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes if a warrior outdid themselves, then they would be gifted a moko when they came back to the p\u0101 (village), on their buttocks and on their thighs.\n\n\n\nIt was just seen as normal, as part of just who you were.\n\nWhen European settlers began arriving en masse in the early 19th century, M\u0101ori culture was forced to adapt, Ellis says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our culture changed more rapidly to try and mediate increasing encroachment into our sovereignty.\"\n\n\n\nHona says he was fortunate enough to be a part of a generation that grew up in M\u0101ori-based schools, bringing about today's \"new age\". Source: Supplied / Kiingitanga In 1907, the Tohunga Suppression Act targeted M\u0101ori spiritual, healing and cultural experts, further marginalising traditional knowledge and practices such as t\u0101 moko.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the following decades, a range of assimilation measures continued to erode M\u0101ori cultural forms. In schools, M\u0101ori children were discouraged from and punished for speaking their language, te reo M\u0101ori.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results were dramatic: according to government data, in 1913, more than 90 per cent of M\u0101ori schoolchildren could speak the language. By 1975, that figure had plunged to less than 5 per cent.\n\n\n\nReclaiming culture\n\nToday, t\u0101 moko is more popular than it has been in some 200 years, according to Ellis. Facial moko are visible in New Zealand's parliament , on professional sporting fields, in courtrooms and on TV news broadcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her maiden speech to parliament last month, Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori Party) MP Oriini Kaipara said M\u0101ori language and arts had only survived \"because we fought for it, M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori alike\".\n\n\n\nBefore entering politics, Oriini Kaipara was a journalist. She was the first person with a moko kauae to anchor primetime news. Source: Getty / Mark Mitchell/The New Zealand Herald In Australia, Victoria Police announced last month that it had updated its tattoo policy to allow a M\u0101ori constable to receive a moko kauae \u2013 making her the first officer in the state to do so. (The first member of Queensland Police to wear a moko kauae was permitted in 2021.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt represents a step forward for cultural inclusion following several recent reports of M\u0101ori being denied entry to venues in Australia due to cultural tattoos, raising questions over whether anti-discrimination laws need to be reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn New Zealand, acceptance isn't universal either. In June, the country's foreign minister, Winston Peters, himself M\u0101ori, was criticised for referring to a M\u0101ori MP's mataora as \"scribbles on his face\", a comment many saw as emblematic of the prejudice that t\u0101 moko wearers still encounter.\n\n\n\nThe surge in visibility of t\u0101 moko has come hand in hand with other forms of cultural revival driven by political activism and community initiatives over the past five decades, including the establishment of M\u0101ori language schools such as Hona's.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from New Zealand\u2019s 2023 General Social Survey suggests that 25.6 per cent of M\u0101ori and 6.2 per cent of the wider population can speak te reo at least fairly well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 978,000 people of M\u0101ori descent living in New Zealand, according to 2023 NZ Census data, making up nearly 20 per cent of the total population.\n\n\n\nA generational shift after 'a lot of pain'\n\nWhile there is limited data tracking the prevalence of M\u0101ori tattoos, a 2018 government survey suggested around 18 per cent of the M\u0101ori population bear a t\u0101 moko, up from 15 per cent in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data also suggested a generational divide: younger M\u0101ori are far more likely to have one than those aged 55 or over.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Julie Paama-Pengelly has been a t\u0101 moko artist for around 35 years and has witnessed the revival of the art form firsthand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the beginning, there was a lot of mamae , a lot of pain around it for our people,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the elders didn't want it to happen. They just saw a period where it was difficult for them to wear these sorts of things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess it made them quite fearful of being oppressed because of it.\"\n\n\n\nArtist Julie Paama-Pengelly received her moko kauae in Tahiti, which is regarded as an ancestral homeland for M\u0101ori. Source: Supplied But she says now, there's \"a huge movement\" among those under 30, despite older generations remaining \"more hesitant\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From the era that they have been and not feeling proud of being M\u0101ori, it takes quite a lot to flick that switch and go: 'You know what? I can do this \u2014 and I need to do this for my children and my grandchildren,'\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, the majority of Paama-Pengelly's client base is aged between 40 and 80.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 61-year-old says that\u2019s mostly due to her own age, but explained that many older M\u0101ori decide to receive moko after reckoning with long-held beliefs about perception and worthiness.\n\n\n\nWho can receive a t\u0101 moko, and when?\n\nMany M\u0101ori choose to receive tattoos to mark milestones, such as becoming an adult, or simply to honour their ancestry at any time. For some, especially those receiving facial moko, a lot of deep introspection goes into the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaama-Pengelly was in her mid-50s when she decided to receive her own moko kauae from an artist who shared her genealogy. A lot of thought went into her decision, including whether her elders should have received one first.\n\n\n\nPaama-Pengelly applied moko kauae for Jeanette Rata and her Aunty Kahu in 2018. Source: Supplied / Angie-Pepper O'Bomsawin Hona, who received his facial moko at 29 , spent several years discussing what it means to wear a mataora and the responsibility that comes with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we grew up, we were told stories about earning. You had to earn the right to receive this and this type of moko,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was acceptable to get everywhere else, but in your face, because it's so sacred, it was almost like a rule \u2014 a tikanga \u2014 that it was earned.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe recalls that his grandmother, who chose to receive a moko kauae later in life, challenged his belief that it had to be earned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, we're at a time now where we need to bring our art form back,\" Hona says, looking back on their conversation.\n\n\n\nWe are M\u0101ori. It's our right. And in order for us to revitalise that, we need to start wearing it.\n\nSome artists consider tattooing non-M\u0101ori people, but it often depends on the recipient's intentions and understanding. Paama-Pengelly says she would not perform a facial moko for someone who is not M\u0101ori.\n\n\n\n'Unashamedly M\u0101ori'\n\nIn 2023, New Zealand elected its most conservative government in decades, later formalised as a three-party coalition led by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the two years since, Luxon's government has sought to reshape various policies that affect M\u0101ori, reopening old wounds for many in the community.\n\n\n\nAmong the changes: winding back the use of M\u0101ori words in the public service and school curricula, abolishing the M\u0101ori Health Authority and an unsuccessful bid to review the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014 the 1840 agreement between M\u0101ori chiefs and the British Crown that upholds M\u0101ori rights and serves as a founding document of New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nM\u0101ori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said in 2023 that, in a matter of months, the new government had taken \"us into a decline like we've never seen in race relations, certainly not since the earliest stages of colonisation\".\n\n\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, left, and Rawiri Waititi are co-leaders of the M\u0101ori Party. Source: Getty / Mark Mitchell/The New Zealand Herald Against that backdrop, the pride and symbolism represented by t\u0101 moko have become even more potent for some M\u0101ori today.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaama-Pengelly says the government can't stop the momentum after four decades of cultural revival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can't take it out of us anymore. You might think that you can make these decisions, but we're not going to go back,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllis, one of only a handful of academics specialising in M\u0101ori art history, says: \"There is nothing more that says 'I am unashamedly who I am' than by wearing a facial moko.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a very clear statement: I'm unashamedly M\u0101ori, so deal with it.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Fast fashion giant H&M is under investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) amid claims that roughly 1,500 of its Australian staff were underpaid, potentially millions of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Swedish company, which operates 34 stores across Australia, told SBS News it had launched a \"comprehensive remediation process\", including back pay for affected workers, after an internal audit uncovered payroll errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News understands the underpayments date back up to nine years, affect around 1,500 workers \u2014 both past and present \u2014 and could run into the millions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an email sent to one former worker and seen by SBS News, H&M said it had conducted a review of its payroll system from June 2016 to October 2024, which identified \"discrepancies between how you were paid and what you should have been paid\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A shortfall in overtime and penalty rates were the main drivers of any underpayment during the review period,\" the company wrote.\n\n\n\nThe former employee, who worked at H&M for nearly five years and requested anonymity, told SBS News they had been underpaid about $8,000, which they only became aware of after receiving the email.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said they had spoken with eight former colleagues who were owed between $4,000 and $15,000 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None of us had a single idea we were being underpaid,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have all had the same reaction. Not surprised by it at all, but shocked we had no idea.\"\n\n\n\n'Self-reported identified errors'\n\nSBS News understands the problem came to light after the retailer transferred from a paper-based payroll to an electronic system, prompting a review of salaried staff pay that revealed incorrect payments.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll current employees have received correct entitlements, but an online portal has been launched for former workers to register, which has seen significant uptake.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its statement to SBS, H&M said it had \"self-reported identified errors\" and was working with the FWO and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) to rectify the issue.\n\n\n\n\"Our people are our greatest strength, and we recognise the impact this situation has had. We are taking action to repay those affected, with the process already in motion,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nH&M said it had also redesigned its rostering and payroll systems to prevent future errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Smith, the SDA's NSW Secretary, said H&M had been working with the union to ensure workers were correctly paid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a case of a company self-reporting where they have identified errors. They have openly worked with the SDA to rectify and remediate any problems,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FWO confirmed it was investigating the retailer but declined to provide further comment.\n\n\n\n",

When you reconsider and redeploy the capital that you manage, our objective is for Australia to be the most obvious and the most compelling place to put it to work. When you run the numbers, when you test risk, return and reliability, our goal is for Australia to be at the very top of your models.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nQueenslanders are being warned to brace for a volatile weekend, with forecasters predicting severe thunderstorms, destructive winds, and giant hail across much of the state\u2019s south-east.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says conditions are likely to worsen today [[Saturday]], which is shaping up to be the most dangerous day of the current weather system.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas stretching from Charters Towers down to the New South Wales border and as far west as Charleville are expected to be hit, with widespread rainfall of 40 to 100 millimetres and the risk of flash flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteorologist Jonathan How.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So Saturday, we see the area of severity very much expands all the way from the mid north-coast of New South Wales and up into the central highlands of Queensland and inland to many communities through there. Importantly, we have a very large area where severe thunderstorms are likely. This includes Brisbane, parts of the Gold Coast, Sunshine coast and inland communities like Toowoomba, Dalby and Kingaoy and down towards Glen Innes and Moree in northern parts of New South Wales.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe warning comes as the family of 21-year-old Finlay Bones, struck by lightning on the Sunshine Coast earlier this week, remembered her as a beautiful, kind and caring young woman taken in the prime of her life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations has urged safe passage for civilians fleeing Sudan\u2019s paramilitary forces in Darfur and protection for those still trapped in El-Fasher.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefugees arriving at a nearby camp after days on foot told aid workers that roads were strewn with bodies, amid reports of hundreds killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces had besieged El-Fasher, the army\u2019s last stronghold in Darfur, for 500 days before seizing control.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN migration agency says more than 36,000 people have fled since Sunday many at night on foot.\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite images suggest an earthen wall built by the R-S-F now traps residents inside what observers call a kill box.\n\n\n\n\n\nSawsan Mukhtar, a Sudanese-Australian journalist based in Adelaide and originally from Al-Fashir, spoke to SBS Arabic and describes the dire conditions there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Rapid Support Forces control the entrances to the city, so it\u2019s difficult to bring in food.

We found people that are more fluent in English are more likely to feel they belonged, feel at home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report is a follow-up on the same survey in 2023, but this time it interviewed over 1,800 respondents across seven languages, including Arabic, Cantonese, Italian, Mandarin, Punjabi, Vietnamese and English.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows that while compared to the same survey done in 2023, there's an increased sense of belonging as more people feel their needs being met and their community members caring each other - there are still challenges to overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also indicates a generational divide, showing younger multilingual respondents are more likely to engage in national and global issues compared to older generation, but also less likely to agree that their cultural communities are fairly represented by media.\n\n\n\n\n\nPunjabi speakers were interviewed for the first time in this series of surveys - and the report has they have the highest sense of belonging across other cohorts, while Mandarin speakers feels the least connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThu Nguyen says one of them is media representation of multicultural communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of representation in the media and in the news, they are however more critical about feeling fairly represented, covered in the media. And we know, from the previous research, again, the finding this time confirm there's such a strong connection between feeling represented in the media in the news and feeling that they belong in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also sheds light on a concept known as collective efficacy, which refers to the belief on the impacts of people's own cultural or language community can have on Australian society.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows those who have stronger belief in their own collectives are more likely to engage in civic participation, such as volunteering, joining protests, and voting in elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while two-third of multilingual Australians have at least one civic engagement, their participation can be uneven.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report finds Mandarin and Punjabi speakers reported the highest civic participation rates, while Cantonese speakers reported the lowest, at 49 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-author Rebecca Griffiths, who's also the Audience Research Lead at SBS, has told SBS Arabic there is still a lot to do.\n\n\n\n",

I ran a branch in Gympie for 13 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut last year, aged 85, she underwent radiotherapy for a cancer affecting her nose - and this year she suffered a heart attack requiring a series of operations, from which she is still recovering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith her husband Andrew also suffering from chronic health conditions, she says, everyday tasks like cleaning the house, or even having a shower, have become difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really puts a lot of stress on your mental health, on your, what you're dealing with - your health, the problem you're dealing with. You get anxious. You get irritable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee and Andrew were first assessed for in-home support at the start of last year before she fell ill.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was assessed again after her cancer treatment - and yet again recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says the two hours a fortnight of cleaning services she eventually received not enough, and even that support is irregular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You pay your taxes all your life. And when you get to this age here I am needing some help for the first time in my life and we can't get it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an ageing population, Australia is facing skyrocketing demand for aged care services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Treasury, within 40 years, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected double, and the number of people aged over 85 will triple.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Gear, the CEO of the Older Persons Advocacy Network or OPAN [[o-pan]], says that presents governments with a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fantastic in Australia that we have an aging population and we have more older people around. But we need to make sure that we've provided a financial system and a financially viable aged care system that some of the levers in this new act help contribute to that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Saturday the 1st of November, sweeping reforms to aged care will come into effect, under the new Aged Care Act which passed parliament a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're the long-awaited result of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Safety and Quality, which delivered its final report in 2021, to repair a system which many saw as broken.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has already acted on some recommendations of the Royal Commission - such as increasing wages for aged care workers, and boosting supervision of residents in nursing homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Gear says the changes represent an new approach to aged care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the New Aged Care Act does is one, it does bring in improved quality standards, which the Royal Commission said was way needed into the aged care system. It also provides greater protections for older people through greater powers of the regulator. It brings a statement of rights that providers have a positive duty to actually uphold the human rights of older people, and it also allows older people to continue to make the decisions for themselves through the supported decision-making framework.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, there is much anxiety in the community, the sector and among advocates about the new funding model.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new Aged Care Act, the current system of Home Care Packages will be replaced by the new Support at Home program, which will require users to fund more of their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green party's spokesperson for older people, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, says the system will benefit private providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This week the [[Aged Care]] Minister was out saying how the profits of Aged Care Providers are up. The Minister is celebrating increasing profits for aged care providers, while older people are going to pay the cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new system, clinical services such as nursing and physiotherapy will be covered by the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut recipients will need to make co-payments for non-clinical services, at a rate determined by their income and assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor personal care such as showering, help with medication, transport, or home modifications, a full pensioner will pay 5 per cent of the cost of the services.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart pensioners and self-funded retirees could pay up to 50 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September, the independent Aged Care Inspector-General Natalie Siegel-Brown reported that older people could forgo having a shower or washing clothes because they couldn't afford to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany advocates, like Older Women\u2019s Network National President Beverly Baker, say older people should not be charged for help with showering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are an older woman, you know that showers are really vital for your personal health wellbeing and basically your capacity to look after yourself. But if you are in danger of falling over in the shower or having an accident in the shower and you need support to have a shower that's viewed as personal. That's not personal, that's medical, it should be under clinical care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor what's considered everyday living services - such as cleaning, gardening and meal preparation - older people will have to pay even more - 17.5 per cent for a full pensioner and up to 80 per cent for part pensioners and self-funded retirees.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose already assessed for or receiving Home Care Packages before the 12th of September 2024, will not have to pay more - and contributions for non-clinical services will be capped at $130,000 over a lifetime for everybody.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeverly Baker says many older people cannot afford those costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will be a major impact, especially if those women are renting - how on earth? - they're already struggling to pay rent. How on earth are they going to pay extra for services? User-pay is not a good approach, and baby boomers aren't all rich.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also concern the changes will not meet growing demand by people like Lee, who want to age at home, so they can stay connected and contribute to the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Australia, there are some 200,000 people either waiting to be assessed or to receive aged care support in their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has committed to release 83,000 new funded Support at Home places, by the middle of next year - and has already brought forward funding for 20,000 new places.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also promised to bring wait times for Support at Home packages down to an average of three months - by 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Reid is the Chief Operating Officer of Uniting NSW.ACT, which provides residential and home care aged services.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is calling for the government to release twice as many new Support at Home places, saying long wait times for at-home care creates pressures on hospitals and residential aged care systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're seeing is pressure on residential aged care. We know our occupancy in that sector is very high, but also to on our hospitals, we know that there are a number of hospitals around the country which are experiencing delayed discharge, where people are languishing in hospitals for long periods of time and do not have access to either residential aged care or to return home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that leads to the issue of availability and funding for Residential Aged Care.\n\n\n\n\n\nA government review of the current pricing system for residential aged care, such as nursing homes, is underway; looking at the government subsidy for people entering care who can't afford to pay a large refundable lump sum to aged care providers for non-clinical costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new Aged Care Act, providers will be able to charge more for the refundable accommodation deposit - to those who can afford it, putting those who can't at a potential disadvantage, in a system that's nearly at full capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Gear - from OPAN - says people with complex needs - or lower means - can find it difficult to find residential care.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says, that's not good enough.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Cycle lanes across inner-Sydney have been one of Lord Mayor Clover Moore's lasting legacies \u2014 infrastructure she has passionately championed for several years. But it seems not everyone shares the same enthusiasm, not even cyclists.\n\nThree months after the unveiling of the $18.5 million Oxford Street cycleway between Hyde Park and Taylor Square in conjunction with the state government, there are still plenty of teething issues.\n\nIn damning video from a typical morning rush hour, as many cyclists can be seen still using the road as those who have opted for the new bike track. The brief clip shows half a dozen cyclists hurtling down the bus lane en route to the CBD despite a state-of-the-art bike lane just metres away on the other side of the street.\n\nAnd while the video is a mere snippet of the day, observations from Yahoo News show it is a repeat occurrence throughout the week.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOne newsagent along the new stretch of the Oxford Street cycleway said while she thought the bike lanes were overall a \"good thing\", cyclists not using them defeated the purpose.\n\n\"The whole point of it was to get people off the road and using the designated lanes so that's not right,\" she told Yahoo. \"They should use it.\"\n\nUsage figures of cycleway disputed\n\nThe bike lane, which will eventually stretch to an existing cycleway at Centennial Park, has had plenty of critics, notably in Paddington with opponents arguing it will hurt business, create traffic problems and pose a safety risk.\n\nBut the City of Sydney council stands by the project, telling Yahoo the new cycleway is \"well used\", with about 3,000 daily weekday trips currently.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat's an even higher figure than the 2,701 daily cyclists the council said passed through the Taylor Square junction during peak hour last year. That figure prompted the Daily Telegraph to do its own assessment, and it found on average, just 391 cyclists used the intersection during those times.\n\nPlenty of cyclists turned up for the cycleway's launch, but it seems not everyone is keen to use it. Source: Bicycle NSW\n\nCouncil says cyclists need time\n\nAddressing the video, a City of Sydney spokesperson said the council \"understands that habits take time to change\" and said it will continue educating riders on the benefits of using the cycleway.\n\n\"Studies show 70 per cent of people in Sydney would like to ride a bicycle more often, but don\u2019t feel safe to mix with vehicular traffic. We build bike lanes to support cycling as a viable transport option for those who would like to ride but don\u2019t feel safe to do so,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThey also said once the final section of the project was complete, it hoped a more seamless experience for riders will see usage increase.\n\nThe City of Sydney reminds riders they have no obligation to use cycle lanes, and that's a message CEO of Bicycle NSW Peter McLean is also keen to get across.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"In many instances it's fair to say that bicycle riders are allowed to still access the road,\" he previously told Yahoo.\n\n\"Sometimes there's debris in the lanes and they're not always well cleaned. Often, there's access issues as well as obstructions and problems with the surface,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Australia\u2019s $13bn critical minerals deal with the US is about challenging China\u2019s \u201cmarket dominance\u201d, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has admitted.\n\nThe strategic risks of China\u2019s global grasp on the mining and refining of critical minerals and rare earths were laid bare last month when Beijing announced export restrictions.\n\nThe move, which has since been paused, was broadly seen as a Chinese power play ahead of Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump at the APEC summit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt also came one week before Mr Albanese met with Mr Trump at the White House, where the leaders inked the landmark framework that the US President promised would produce \u201cso much critical minerals and rare earths you won\u2019t know what to do with them\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be worth about $2,\u201d Mr Trump declared at the time.\n\nIn an interview aired on Sunday, Mr Albanese was asked if he would \u201cdo a deal with China\u201d on critical minerals.\n\nHe did not directly answer but did say that the arrangement with the US was about countering China\u2019s control of global supply \u2013 a point he has downplayed previously, insisting it was purely about the Australia-US relationship.\n\nUS President Donald Trump met with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of APEC. Picture: White House\n\n\u201cChina \u2026 has considerable access to critical minerals and rare earths,\u201d he told the ABC.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the issues is their market dominance which is there.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that his government supported trade and that monopolies invited \u201cdisruption\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe support trade,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t support is dominance by any one nation because that can cause disruption in the way that markets operate.\n\n\u201cAnd what Australia\u2019s doing is seizing the opportunity that\u2019s there.\n\n\u201cWe have the minerals under our great continent that will help to power the globe in this century.\n\n\u201cWhat we can do as well is to value add, create more jobs, by making sure that we don\u2019t just dig things up and export them, wait for value to be added and jobs created overseas.\u201d\n\n\u2018Straight talks\u2019\n\nMr Albanese on Sunday touched down in Canberra after spending all of this week touting Australia\u2019s trade and investment offerings at major summits in Malaysia and South Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the summits put leaders of some of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies all in one place, it was the meeting between the Chinese and US presidents \u2013 dubbed the \u201cG2\u201d \u2013 that dominated attention.\n\nAfter months of exchanging threats of trade-stopping tariffs, they emerged from their one-on-one in South Korea highly complimentary of one another and with a fragile truce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really positive that President Trump and President Xi had a meeting this week and that they\u2019re going to visit each other\u2019s respective countries,\u201d Mr Albanese said in his interview, adding that it is an \u201cuncertain world\u201d.\n\nAsked if it was \u201csustainable\u201d to continue balancing Australia\u2019s heavy trade dependence on China while navigating simmering regional tensions spurred by Beijing\u2019s rapid military build-up, Mr Albanese rolled out his China mantra.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe have a relationship where we co-operate where we can, we disagree where we must, but we engage in our national interests and we have straight talks with each other,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have different political systems, so it\u2019s not surprising that there would be differences arise.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is how you deal with them, that you don\u2019t allow (the) relationship to be defined just by difference, and that is what we have done as the Australian government.\n\n\u201cAnd that is in Australia\u2019s interest. It\u2019s in China\u2019s interest, but it\u2019s also of course in the interest of regional peace and security.\u201d\n\nPressed on increased Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, Mr Albanese said Australia would continue its \u201cfreedom of navigation exercises\u201d to ensure vital trade routes were not compromised.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe South China Sea is an important thoroughfare for our trade, and that\u2019s why we engage in freedom of navigation exercises,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s understood \u2013 there\u2019s nothing new about that, and it\u2019s important that we continue to engage constructively.\n\n\u201cI certainly do that with President Xi, who I had a number of informal discussions with over the last couple of days.\u201d\n\nChinese premier could visit Uluru\n\nIn another interview with Sky News, Mr Albanese also said Chinese Premier Li Qiang could visit Uluru when he comes to Australia next year.\n\nThe pair have met several times this year, including this week\u2019s summits.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Albanese said they had a \u201cdiscussion about a visit to Uluru that he expressed an interest in\u201d.\n\n\u201cI encourage that,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\n\n\u201cI think that would be a very good thing to showcase Central Australia to what is after all well over a billion people.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good tourism market for Australia as well.\u201d",

        "text": "A luxury 60-day cruise around Australia has been cancelled following the death of an elderly woman who was left behind on a remote island.\n\nSuzanne Rees was left behind on Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef after she broke off while hiking with a group of fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship.\n\nThe ship departed without her, before returning a few hours later once the crew realised she was missing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Sydney woman\u2019s body was not found until after a major search operation the following day.\n\nCoral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield confirmed on Saturday that passengers and crew had been notified the cruise had been cancelled.\n\nSuzanne Rees was left behind on Lizard Island after she broke off while hiking with a group. (Katherine Rees via AP)\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday evening, Coral Expeditions notified passengers and crew on-board the Coral Adventurer vessel that, following the tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues, the decision had been made to cancel the remainder of the voyage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSince that time, our team has worked to co-ordinate the return journeys of the passengers via chartered flights, as well as the crew and the vessel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Fifield said passengers would be issued a full refund.\n\n\u201cThe Coral team prides itself on delivering high quality experiences to our guests,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was increasingly apparent given the circumstances of the last week that we could not deliver on this promise.\u201d\n\nThe Coral Adventurer was just two days into its voyage. Picture: Coral Expeditions\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) reportedly said in a separate statement on Saturday it had issued a notice to the master of the ship \u201cprohibiting the embarkation of any new passengers\u201d.\n\nThe safety authority said that it understood that the Coral Adventurer would return to Cairns, where AMSA staff would meet it.\n\nAMSA is investigating why Ms Rees may not have been accounted for during boarding.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Coral Adventurer was just two days into its voyage, departing Cairns on October 24 and then arriving at Lizard Island, its first stop.\n\nSuzanne Rees\u2019 daughter, Katherine Rees, said on Thursday that her family was \u201cshocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\u201d.\n\nLizard Island, a remote paradise on the Great Barrier Reef, is known for its beaches and rugged hiking trails.\n\n\u201cFrom the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\u201d\n\nMs Rees\u2019 daughter described her mother as an \u201cactive 80-year-old\u201d.\n\nMr Fifield earlier this week said Coral Expeditions was \u201cdeeply sorry that this has occurred\u201d and had offered its support to the Rees family.\n\nHe also confirmed the company was \u201cworking closely\u201d with police and other authorities probing the death.",
