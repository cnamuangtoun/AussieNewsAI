(Getty)\n\nThe offer will initially be available to states and regions under the Default Market Offer (DMO), which acts as a limit to what retailers can charge for electricity.\n\nThese are NSW, south-east Queensland and South Australia, with consultations to extend the offer to the rest of the country by 2027.\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the move would benefit all Australians.\n\n\"Free daytime power for families across Australia is proof that what's good for the planet is good for your pocket,\" he said.\n\n\"People who are able to move electricity use into the zero cost power period will benefit directly, whether they have solar panels or not and whether they own or rent.\n\n\"The more people take up the offer and move their use, the greater the system benefits that lower costs for all electricity users will be.\"\n\nElectricity prices are rising, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing they have jumped nine per cent in the last quarter, subsequently having an impact on inflation.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump plummets to a stunning new low\n\nChris Bowen has claimed the Solar Saver scheme will help millions of Aussies cut their power bills. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nBowen said the government would reform the DMO to make it cheaper for Australians.\n\n\"Australians deserve a fairer go when it comes to their energy bills,\" he said.\n\n\"Reform to the DMO will strip out unnecessary costs and expand protections to all standing offer customers and small customers in embedded networks, including renters and apartment dwellers.\"",

(Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nHe was assessed by staff on field but was deemed to have passed his HIA, something that Johnson finds incredulous.\n\n\"In warm-up he [gets] a shoulder to the head, like, smack bang to the face and like, loose body to the ground. He's not sleeping on the ground, he sort of rolls over \u2026 but it's a limp body to the ground,\" Johnson explained.\n\n\"Now all I thought, straight away when I saw that was, OK, if that happened in a game or if that happened at training during the week, he's done.\n\n\"It's done \u2026 they probably even go cat one on it \u2026 you're just done bro, like, come on, player welfare, we're looking after you.\n\n\"But then it comes through the head piece that he's passed his HIA and me and Richie, we look at each other and we go, 'No way.'\n\n\"You want to see the best players playing, but when you [were watching] you felt sick over the incident. He's not right. It was a bad one, it wasn't a mediocre one, it was a bad one in warm-up.\"\n\nKatoa went on to suffer two more head knocks in the match, with Johnson increasingly concerned about the impact.\n\n\"He takes another one in the first half and he's pulled off [the pitch] now I'm like, 'OK, you've just had your second head knock, it's, bro, we're going to take the decision out of your hands now.'\n\n\"Don't even give him the possibility, don't give him the chance of passing this.\n\n\"But they do it, and he passes.\n\n\"Sure enough, he rolls back out there \u2026 but then I see him take a third one.\n\n\"I actually felt proper sick. It was yuck.\n\n\"They pull him off, I don't even know, I don't want to speculate, I don't know if that was his HIA pull off. But what we see from the sideline is really alarming.\"\n\nEliesa Katoa was taken to the bench before suffering \"seizure\" activity. (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nJohnson said that every player would want to keep playing, no matter what the circumstances, but it was the duty of the medical staff to take the decision out of their hands.\n\n\"I hope it never gets to that point again for any of our players again,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I don't like our players not being looked after.\"\n\nTonga coach Kristian Woolf defended the Tongan medical staff pitchside, saying that it was not his job to question their judgement.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\n\"We have two very experienced doctors there, they have done the usual [tests].

(ABC South West WA: Pip Waller)\n\nAvocados Australia WA director Brad Rodgers said securing access to new markets was crucial to ensuring the industry's growth.\n\n\"We're rewriting our national strategy plan and export will be a big focus,\" he said.\n\n\"We're working hard to secure new market access, particularly to China.\"\n\nDue to its pest-free status, WA already has trade access to the Japanese and Thai markets, but China remains the coveted prize.\n\n\"We've done a lot of groundwork there as an industry,\" Mr Rodgers said.\n\n\"We've signed MOUs [memorandum of understanding] with Shanghai markets worth around $250 million in Australian avocados, which shows just how strong their interest is.\"\n\nFormal approval to export Australian avocados to China is still being negotiated between Canberra and Beijing.\n\nIndustry leaders are confident WA growers will be ready to ship as soon as the green light is given.",

        "text": "Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest's controversial plan to alter the natural river system on his large outback WA cattle station is under renewed legal scrutiny, with his lawyers arguing the intervention is needed to help solve the region's water shortages.\n\nMr Forrest had planned to build 10 specialised weirs along a section of the Ashburton River, which flows through his Minderoo Station in the state's Pilbara.\n\nThe weirs would capture an estimated 8.4 gigalitres of water per year, with the precious resource in short supply across the region.\n\nThe Ashburton River has been deemed a sacred site by Aboriginal traditional owners. (Supplied: Buurabalayji Thalanyji Aboriginal Corporation)\n\nThe plan was initially rejected by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) in 2023, when it was decided the primary benefit of the project would not benefit the overall general interest of the community.\n\nIn that decision, Justice Janine Pritchard also found the entirety of the Ashburton River was of spiritual significance to the Thalanyji people.\n\nThe river runs through Mr Forrest's Minderoo Station, near the Pilbara town of Onslow. (Lucie Bell)\n\nBut last year, an appeal by the Forrest family in the Supreme Court on procedural grounds led to a fresh hearing, a move that was described by the Buurabalayji Thalanyji Aboriginal Corporation (BTAC) as \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nNeed for water paramount\n\nProceedings are now underway in the SAT with barrister for Forrest and Forrest Pty Ltd Ken Pettit SC telling the tribunal the irrigation system was needed to address the \"enormous need for water\" on Mr Forrest's station.\n\nHe said a February report by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation suggested weirs were essential, due to limited groundwater supply across the Pilbara region.\n\nThe State Administrative Tribunal previously blocked Andrew Forrest's proposal due to cultural heritage concerns. (ABC News: Andrew Williams)\n\nThe SAT had previously found the benefit of the proposed water capture project would primarily be a private one for the Forrests.\n\nMr Pettit said if the project went ahead, roughly a quarter of the water captured per year would go to Hastings Technology Metals (HTM) for its Yangibana rare earths project in the Gascoyne.\n\nThe water would be used for a hydrometallurgical plant, to be built near Onslow, to process materials from a mine located about 300 kilometres to its south-east.\n\nWyloo Metals, also owned by the Forrests, took ownership of 60 per cent of the Yangibana project in a joint venture with HTM earlier this year.\n\nMr Pettit pointed to the support from both the state and federal governments for the Yangibana project and its role in decarbonisation as evidence of the broader benefit of the project.\n\nSacred site at risk, traditional owners say\n\nIn the previous SAT decision, it was found the entirety of the Ashburton River was of spiritual significance to traditional owners.\n\nThis was because the river, from its mouth near Onslow to inland near Nanutarra, was a registered Aboriginal heritage site where the Thalanyji people believed the water serpent Warnamankura lived.\n\nThe Thalanyji people believe the Warnamankura water serpent lives in the Ashburton River. (Supplied: Bill Lawrie)\n\nWarnamankura created the river, according to Thalanyji belief, and still travels up and down it to protect the country.\n\nTraditional owners feared the weirs could kill the water serpent spirit in the river.\n\nA sheet of rocks breaking the surface of the Ashburton River on Andrew Forrest's Minderoo property marks where the mining magnate has developed his prototype upside-down weir.

        "text": "Sitting in his home in Balga, Western Australia, Uncle Wayne Garlett reflects on a life-changing injury that left him with a damaged spinal cord.\n\nAt nine years old, he was hit by a car and sent to hospital.\n\nHe managed to recover but was forced to overcome another challenge brought by the Western Australian government.\n\n\"I spent about 18 months in hospital and then got taken away to a mission,\" the proud Ballardong man and Stolen Generations survivor said.\n\nAboriginal children in Western Australia were then under the control of the Native Welfare Act, which was used to \"assist in their economic and social assimilation\".\n\nIt would be decades before Uncle Wayne reunited with his family, but the injury that separated him from his loved ones returned to haunt him.\n\n\"When I got to about 46, I just kept falling over and falling down. I didn't know what was wrong,\" Uncle Wayne, now 71, said.\n\n\"They did a check on me and said my spinal cord was touching the bone.\"\n\nTwo operations later and with steel rods in his neck, he now relies on a walker, and for the past seven weeks has been receiving home care services to live in the house he proudly owns.\n\n\"I'm really enjoying my life at the moment, but they say when you're on a good wicket, they change the boundary, they change rules, and that's been happening all my life,\" he said.\n\nOn November 1, the government transitioned to a new aged care system, requiring full-time pensioners, part-pensioners, and self-funded retirees to make a co-contribution for services, whether they live at home or in residential care.\n\nThe changes apply to those who were approved for home-based care after September 12, 2024, or entered residential care after November 1, 2025.\n\nThe government says clients will not be out of pocket for clinical services such as nursing and physiotherapy.\n\nBut help for in-home everyday tasks \u2014 like cleaning the house or preparing meals \u2014 will attract some of the highest contributions.\n\nUncle Wayne said that without aged care help, he would need support from a full-time carer.\n\nFor him, the alternative of returning to an institution like an aged care home was unfathomable.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be back in one of them places because without your independence, you might as well lay down and die,\" he said.\n\n'Discriminatory' changes\n\nThe new co-contributions are calculated using an asset and income test.\n\nLast year, the government announced that recipients of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse would not have to count their compensation as an \"asset\" when being means-tested for residential aged care.\n\nHowever, state-based reparations paid to Stolen Generations survivors did not receive the same treatment.\n\nProfessor Steve Larkin, chairperson of Stolen Generations advocacy body the Healing Foundation, said it was unjust that compensation for government-inflicted trauma could leave elders struggling.\n\nSteve Larkin says Stolen Generations survivors are feeling \"vulnerable\" and \"intimidated\". (ABC News: Daniel Taylor)\n\n\"I don't understand the logic as to why one is exempt and the other is not \u2026 on the face of it, it's discriminatory,\" he said.\n\n\"For people who are some of the sickest and poorest, in their elderly years, having to go through further hardship \u2026 it's callous disrespect.\n\n\"Survivors would feel very vulnerable, very intimidated, and probably worry about what the immediate future holds.\"\n\nThe ABC asked the Minister for Aged Care and Seniors, Sam Rae, if state-based Stolen Generations redress payments were exempt from means testing.\n\nSam Rae says the new act will deliver \"high-quality, safe, respectful and sustainable\" care for First Nations elders. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nIn a statement, Mr Rae did not answer the question directly but said: \"Every First Nations elder deserves access to aged care that is culturally sensitive and suitable for them, which is why redress payments under the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Institutional Abuse are already exempted from means testing under the new Act.\"\n\nThe minister's office also said it was considering feedback from Indigenous stakeholders about other redress schemes and their impact on co-contributions.\n\nBetween one in 10 and one in three First Nations children were forcibly removed from their families between 1910 and 1970.\n\nAll jurisdictions except Queensland have established Stolen Generations redress schemes to acknowledge the grave injustice, loss and trauma to those who were forcibly removed, with hopes it will start a new chapter for healing.\n\n\"The compensation that they did receive in recognition of the institutionalisation and removal is now not exempt under the new act, so that money is now going to be spent on basic home living expenses,\" Professor Larkin said.\n\n\" It's not really compensation, is it? \"\n\nConcerns co-payments could push elders into residential homes\n\nAdvocates are also concerned about how Stolen Generations survivors will be able to afford the co-payments for services delivered in the home.\n\nPart-pensioners who received Stolen Generations compensation could pay anywhere from 17.5 per cent to 80 per cent of the bill for basic needs, such as showering.\n\n\"My fear is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders may forgo care on the basis that the co-contributions will cost too much,\" Inspector-General of Aged Care Natalie Siegel-Brown said.\n\nNatalie Siegel-Brown has \"deep concerns\" about how aged care changes will affect First Nations people. (ABC News: West Matteeussen)\n\nShe was also concerned that survivors would be pushed into residential homes earlier because they could not afford the care to remain at home.\n\n\"I have grave concerns about the way residential aged care is mainstreamed for Aboriginal and Torres Islander people, and those institutional settings can be very triggering of trauma from past institutionalisation,\" she said.\n\n'Actively choosing to ignore' Royal Commission report\n\nThe Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety recommended a \"new approach\" for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care that would be co-designed with Indigenous stakeholders.\n\nThe report found \"[t]he current aged care system does not ensure culturally safe care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\"\n\nIts recommendations included flexible funding to expand Indigenous aged care facilities and help providers cover costs, as well as increasing the First Nations workforce.\n\nBut there were \"deep concerns\" that the reforms would do the opposite, as Indigenous organisations were forced to collect new co-payment fees.\n\n\"What we see here is a situation where we are actively choosing to ignore the Royal Commission's recommendations,\" Ms Siegel-Brown said.\n\n\"Not being funded to provide that spiritual, emotional, social care that is so core to the way they do business might alienate them from remaining within the sector.\"\n\nThe ABC spoke with a community-controlled organisation, which did not wish to be named, that said it would not be charging elders for basic care \u2014 something that carries the risk of being found non-compliant.\n\nMr Rae said, since 2022, the government had invested $2 billion \"to support First Nations Elders \u2026 to have better access to aged care services to meet their physical and cultural needs.\"\n\nHe said the new act put \"First Nations elders at the centre of their own care, now and into the future\".\n\nAfter a spinal cord injury, Wayne Garlett finds it difficult to walk and complete everyday tasks. (ABC News: West Matteeussen)\n\nIn Western Australia, Uncle Wayne was looking forward to his next elders' gathering and hoped they would still be affordable under the new aged care reforms.\n\n\"Everyone needs to talk to someone because you go 48, 50 hours and you don't see anyone, but you go along to a group, and you talk your head off or some people just listen,\" he said.\n\n\"It's friendship. It's healing.\n\n\"Without the funding, they'll cease, and we'll just go back to watching TV 15 hours a day, sitting in a chair.\"",

It made the triumph all the sweeter. \u201cThe moment itself was pure jubilation,\u201d he said. Jared Stegman in action for Australia at the Asia-Oceania Flag Football Championships.\n\n\u201cThe women\u2019s team was there as well and have been a big factor in our lead-up, so they came onto the field and everyone was getting around each other. \u201cIt was unexpected, from our own expectations and training it was expected, but no one thought in their wildest dreams we\u2019d be gold medallists.\u201d Stegman has been involved in American football for 18 years. The 35-year-old has plied his trade around the globe \u2013 playing in Australia, Turkey, Sweden, Japan and Germany. But never had an Olympics tilt crossed his mind.\n\nLoading \u201cIt\u2019s definitely given me a new purpose. I\u2019m a high school head of department for English and playing football for fun, and this has started a new fire,\u201d Stegman said. \u201cI always wanted to play for the challenge, which is why I went overseas, because American football is not well regarded, funded and overly competitive here, so this new opportunity is amazing. \u201cThe chance is crazy, it\u2019s unbelievable, and we\u2019ve achieved the first step.\u201d This year, the NFL announced it would release its players to make them available for selection at the LA Games, opening the door for Australian prospects to take on the best of the best on their home turf, such as three-time Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes.\n\nPathways through the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the US also present study and travel opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people trying to get into the Australian team because they see this as a shot to go to the Olympics, and particularly to play the US guys in LA,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt transcends a lot of sports.\u201d Rival code raid Kelly had previously declared Australian stars such as Sydney Rooster-turned-Wallaby Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii and rugby sevens weapon Maddison Levi would be tailor-made for flag football.\n\nNow, he said, \u201cyou could name 1000\u201d. Those to make the jump included former Wallabies star Quade Cooper, Essendon Bombers Victorian Football League talent Jacob Atley and St George-Illawarra Dragons under-21s winger Caine Barnes. Cooper did not feature at the oceania championships, having returned to Japan where he plays for the Kintetsu Liners rugby union side. Kelly said his impact at a training camp in the US was profound. Quade Cooper is \u201cin the mix\u201d for the flag football World Cup. Credit: Getty \u201cHe was phenomenal. The one thing Quade brings is preparation \u2013 the guy is meticulous with his preparation and thought process, and that was really beneficial for our young guys and girls,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the mix for the World Cup next year, but it\u2019s a very hard team to get into on the back of that performance.\u201d Stegman said the transferable skills with other football codes would make the shift appealing, with Aussie rules athletes in particular blessed with the attributes needed to thrive. \u201cTheir skill set is perfect for flag football, they\u2019re just so trained to catch and trap the ball, and every route you run you\u2019re leading for the ball,\u201d he said. Transferable skills include line running, catching ability and aerial prowess, while being able to respond to 360-degree opposition pressure.\n\nGrowing Australian presence Since flag football\u2019s inclusion on the Sporting Schools program, Kelly revealed more than 50,000 juniors had come through the ranks across just five terms. In his words, \u201cit\u2019s exploded\u201d. Loading When the Philadelphia Eagles conquered Kansas City in this year\u2019s Super Bowl, 2.6 million people in Australia watched. As Melbourne prepares to host an LA Rams game in 2026 at the MCG, Kelly anticipated the game\u2019s popularity would hit new heights.",

        "text": "Australian households will be able to tap into an abundance of rooftop solar to lower their power bills under a new Labor energy proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes, announced by Energy Minister Chris Bowen on Tuesday, will give consumers free access to electricity for three hours each day.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar panels are installed on over four million rooftops across Australia. The scheme aims to access solar power generated throughout the day and incentivise Australians to change their habits, shifting some energy use from the busy evening period to the free block.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why your energy bills could be getting higher and what you can do about it\n\nAnalysis from the federal energy department showed that a single-person household could save 9 per cent on bills by shifting 10 per cent of its energy use to the free period.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes a month after renewable energy surpassed coal as the major source of power generation in Australia, amid ongoing political debate over the nation's energy future.\n\n\n\nHow will it work?\n\nThe Solar Sharer program will be introduced to the default market offer, which acts as a minimum standard for plans and prices offered by electricity retailers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFree electricity will be provided during the middle of the day when solar power generation peaks, Bowen said, and would deliver benefits across the network.\n\n\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen says the scheme will be accessible to all Australians, whether they own or rent. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch \"People who are able to move electricity use into the zero-cost power period will benefit directly, whether they have solar panels or not and whether they own or rent,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The more people take up the offer and move their use, the greater the system benefits that lower costs for all electricity users will be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther changes proposed for the default offer include restricting marketing and competition costs embedded in prices.\n\n\n\nHow do you access the Solar Sharer scheme?\n\nTo access the program, Australians will need to sign up through their energy providers and have a smart meter installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor properties with solar panels, smart meters are part of the existing installation costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is unclear how energy providers will navigate charging the installation cost, roughly $100 to $200, for homes without solar.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor to offer discounts for home batteries in solar energy pledge\n\nHouseholds in NSW, south-east Queensland and South Australia will have access to the scheme from June 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will follow consultation with the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), to start on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is negotiating with other states and jurisdictions to extend the program by 2027.\n\n\n\n'Unintended consequences' of the free energy proposal\n\nRetailers including AGL, OVO and Red Energy offer free access to electricity during specified hours, and an AGL spokesperson said it would work with the government \"on the detailed design of the proposed reform policy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, often plans that include free hours charge higher supply charges or energy use rates at other parts of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AER is expected to oversee the Solar Sharer scheme and ensure Australians get a good deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisa Kinnear, CEO of the Australian Energy Council, the peak body for electricity retailers, says the energy sector was caught by \"surprise\", with the lack of consultation risking \"damaging industry confidence, as well as creating the potential for unintended consequences\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In developing energy products such as those that offer free energy for a period of time, retailers, and in particular, smaller retailers, need to carefully consider their exposure to the market, their hedging strategy, the impact of network costs, and a range of other factors,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Powerless: The hidden crisis of prepaid energy and First Nations communities\n\n\"These factors are not identical for all retailers, and universal access to a product places material risks on retailers that in some instances might only be mitigated by them exiting a market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAER chair Clare Savage said the changes could help to address peak demand on Australia's energy network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Shifting more demand to the middle of the day would lower the cost of the electricity system for all consumers as we don't need to build as much generation or poles and wires to meet the evening peak,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable energy contributed 48.8 per cent of Australia's power during September, according to research company Rystag Energy, while coal represented 47.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

She's still living with the lasting symptoms of repeated concussions.\n\n\n\n\"Concussions I've had have been a lot of injuries because of running into things, because of symptoms I've had along the way. I've had a lot of balance and coordination issues; I've had headaches. I've had memory loss. I've had sleep issues and mood issues.\"\n\n\n\nThe local GP or emergency department is often the first place people go when they're in a daze.\n\n\n\nBut research suggests up to half of those who sustain a concussion don't get the care they need.\n\n\n\nProfessor Karen Barlow is an academic paediatric neurologist at the University of Queensland, specialising in acquired brain injury in children and adolescence.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the knowledge gap needs to be addressed.\n\n\n\n\"We found that a lot a people do fall through the cracks. So community sport, or just simple falls and bad luck, and (they) were given information such as don't do anything, stay at home, don't be in a dark room, don't do any exercise. Actually all those things we know now are the wrong things to do after a concussion.\"\n\n\n\nProfessor Barlow is the author of the report published in the Medical Journal of Australia which describe initial diagnosis and assessment as a critical first step.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Queensland researchers led the development of the guidelines, which say patients should then receive clear, age-appropriate, advice on what symptoms to look out for, as well as when to follow up with a healthcare professional, if they persist.\n\n\n\nProfessor Barlow again:\n\n\n\n\"Patient education is really important; so that the people who have experienced concussion know what to expect. What's recovery, what's normal symptoms after a concussion and how long should these symptoms last? And what can the clinician recommend to help them recover more speedily. And then, following on from that, say a person has really severe headaches, what can they do to manage those headaches, to manage dizziness, to manage those mood problems. To make sure people get the care that they need in a timely fashion.\" The new model of care, called 'Mind the Gap', states that patients can be advised to \"safely and gradually\" resume normal activity as early as 24 hours post-injury.\n\n\n\nThis includes light physical activity.\n\n\n\nBut advice on returning to sport should be individualised - and based on a patient's symptoms.\n\n\n\nLeft untreated, these can have serious effects on a person's work, school performance and social function.\n\n\n\nNow a university student, Megan Butner is no longer playing sport.\n\n\n\nBut she's learnt to juggle the demands of a full life, with the help of specialist concussion care.\n\n\n\nShe hopes this will be made more accessible because of these guidelines.\n\n",

Because $20 it will only last maybe one day. All depends on what you got. You got a deep freezer, you got a fridge, and air conditioning. But when my kids come I would have all three going.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA day\u2019s worth of power can cost twenty to forty dollars, sometimes even more during the summer heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nBernadette says she\u2019s constantly rationing her usage, especially when her three kids are home.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on the road, about twenty-seven kilometres south, in the neighbouring Indigenous community of Djarindjin,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I go to the shop and buy $20 power\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAudrey Shadforth has a similar story.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudrey says her power ran out just the night before we interviewed her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had power all night then about 9pm it go off. By 8.40 we have to hurry look for power, look for some money to pay for power. That only gave me like what, few minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Australia, around fifteen thousand First Nations households use prepaid electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most, it\u2019s not a choice; it\u2019s the only option their retailer offers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA report by Original Power, together with Notre Dame\u2019s Nulungu Research Institute and Western Sydney University, reveals just how widespread the issue is.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found some sixty-five thousand First Nations people live under mandatory prepayment systems \u2014 with homes disconnected on average more than thirty times a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLloyd Pigram is from the Broome Nulungu Research Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's one of the researchers who conducted interviews in remote communities to help deliver the report, called The Right to Power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Old people with chronic illnesses running out of power as we were doing the survey, to people actually needing top up as we were doing the interviews... It's hard not to get emotional or angry because it is like the power's off and they've actually got not long left to live. They are struggling to you know, they know the power on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for this is that in remote parts of Australia, many communities were never connected to the main power grid and relied on small local systems, which made billing and payments hard to manage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo power companies introduced prepaid meters, ensuring bills were covered upfront, but also creating a system where regulators have focused more on collecting payments than protecting people\u2019s right to power.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Josie Douglas from the Central Land Council says without stronger consumer protections, communities will continue to fall behind national Closing the Gap targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Out of the four jurisdictions, the Northern Territory fairs the worst. This is outrageous. Aboriginal people in remote communities are experiencing 59 disconnections per year. We know the disconnections have a very strong correlation with heat. When the temperature rises, disconnections increase.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report warns that with extreme heat becoming more frequent, the consequences of power loss can be deadly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO of Energy Consumers Australia Brendan French says that no electricity means no refrigeration for food or medication, no cooling, and no access to safety alerts during heatwaves or cyclones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are tens of thousands of households living without the consumer protections that you and I enjoy. And also none of the opportunities as an irony, that in centre of Australia a hundred days over 35 degrees, people can't get access to solar power to reduce their bills. The brilliance of this report though, is that it doesn't just focus on history or injustice and equality. It focuses on the roadmap.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the government has received the report and appreciates the information about energy security in remote communities \u2014 but has stopped short of any firm commitment, saying energy delivery remains the responsibility of states and territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Western Australian government spokesperson said it will consider the report\u2019s recommendations, highlighting Horizon Power\u2019s rollout of advanced metering and solar programs to improve reliability and energy equity in remote communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Northern Territory government also says it would also review the report and consider any recommendations to improve coordination or simplify access to relief programs, while Horizon Power added that it provides hardship support and energy coaching, but that wider policy decisions rest with government.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith extreme weather events like heatwaves predicted to become more frequent, keeping the power on has never been more important.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Ardyaloon, Bernadette Angus says her community has learned to look after one another.\n\n\n\n",

However, Chappel said they \"don't readily break down in the environment and are still defined as plastic\" under NSW's Plastic Reduction and Circular Economy Act 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that companies were quick to remove the product from shelves once notified and that the EPA was working with major retailers, including Chemist Warehouse and Priceline, to get affected products off shelves.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the order only extends within NSW \u2014 meaning some of the same products can still be sold elsewhere in Australia.\n\n\n\nWhat are microbeads and why are they banned?\n\nMicrobeads are tiny pieces of plastic used in cosmetics and personal care products, usually for exfoliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were once common in cosmetics and personal care products to add texture, exfoliate or extend shelf life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause they aren't biodegradable, when they're washed down drains and enter waterways, they can be ingested by fish and other marine life.\n\n\n\n\n\nTara Jones from the Australian Marine Conservation Society says microplastics like microbeads are a \"huge problem\" for the ocean and its wildlife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Microplastics are almost impossible to remove once they enter the environment,\" Jones told SBS News. \"These microplastics don't disappear once they're washed down the drain \u2014 they persist in the environment, continuing to harm marine animals and plants.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Animals of all sizes ingest microplastics, from tiny plankton to whales.\"\n\n\n\nThey're also turning up inside human bodies, something that worries Dr Karen Raubenheimer, a senior lecturer at the University of Wollongong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whenever we look in the body and the environment, we find microplastics,\" Raubenheimer told SBS News. \"Different shapes of microplastics seem to collect in different places \u2014 including the gut and brain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the plastics themselves can cause harm, but they can also leach chemicals absorbed from the products they're in. \"It's not just an environmental thing, it's a human health thing. It's water quality, food security, it's all in the soils,\" she said.\n\n\n\nA patchwork of bans\n\nAustralia doesn't have a national ban on microbeads.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, several states and territories have implemented their own rules targeting \"rinse-off\" personal care products \u2014 such as face scrubs and body washes \u2014 as part of broader single-use plastic restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nRinse-off microbeads are banned in:\n\n\n\n\n\n- NSW (since November 2022)\n\n\n\n- ACT (since July 2023)\n\n\n\n- WA (since September 2023)\n\n\n\n- QLD (since September 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Northern Territory has also proposed banning rinse-off microplastic products, set to be implemented in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria, South Australia, and Tasmania have not outlawed microbeads.\n\n\n\n\n\nJones said that while a voluntary phase-out of microbeads in rinse-off products had been \"quite successful\", the EPA's recent enforcement shows a need for \"stronger government regulation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said identifying microbeads can also be difficult for consumers: \"Customers shouldn't need a degree in polymer science to know whether the product they're using has plastic intentionally added to it.\"\n\n\n\nThere's no federal ban on microbeads. Instead, each state and territory sets its own rules. Source: SBS News\n\nWhy regulation remains murky\n\nRaubenheimer said the current bans are narrow in scope and inconsistently applied.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explained that most state bans only apply to \"rinse-off\" products, which leaves room for interpretation. \"Toothpaste could be interpreted as a rinse-off product because you rinse your mouth,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrobeads can also be found in products like sunscreens, makeup and glitter, which often fall outside the definitions used in current bans.\n\n\n\nRaubenheimer said this patchwork approach makes it difficult for industry to comply. \"If it's in one state and not the other, often these products creep across the border. It's very hard to police,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe added that more transparency is needed: \"For us on plastics, it's all about disclosure and traceability. Every time you regulate something, you're almost legitimising something that falls outside of that definition or that regulation, so trying to get them to disclose what's in the property is key so that we can track things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJones said while the current bans were a \"great start\", more needed to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Banning intentionally-added microplastics in rinse-off personal care is a great start, but there are so many other products that contain microbeads that don't fit this category \u2014 cleaning products, makeup, moisturisers and deodorants often have microplastics in them, but these aren't covered by the state bans or voluntary phase-out,\" she said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Environmentalists say plastic decision is the final straw SBS News 03:57 English\n\nHow to check if a product has microbeads\n\nTo figure out if a product has microplastics in it, you'll need to look at the ingredients list.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon microbead ingredients include:\n\n\n\n\n\n- \u200b\u200bPolyethylene (PE)\n\n\n\n- Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\n\n\n\n- Polypropylene (PP)\n\n\n\n- Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)\n\n\n\n- Nylon (PA)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also download the Beat the Microbead app, which allows you to scan a product's barcode to see if it contains microbeads.\n\n\n\n",

And that depletes total stock, creates a sense of urgency and leads to the situation we have now, where property values are rising,\" Owen said.\n\n\n\nA 'tight market' that still holds opportunity\n\nChris Lewis, director of Lyric Finance, told SBS News the underlying issue with the Australian property market is supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is not enough stock in the housing market,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Typically, when there are more buyers than sellers, prices are going to increase.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis described the property market as looking \"particularly tight\", but said it's \"never been a better time for first-time buyers.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News He said the newly introduced 5 per cent deposit scheme for first home buyers is a \"good opportunity\" to get into the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can save on that large deposit for starters,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor first home buyers looking to access the scheme or make the most of the bump in spring listings, Lewis recommended getting pre-approval from a lender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whenever you're looking to take on a transaction of buying property, the first step is talking to a mortgage broker and understanding what's possible and getting that re-approval in place for the bank, so you can start making offers on property with confidence.\"\n\n\n\n",

Optus failed the common sense test of delivering for their customers and the committee inquiry today is an opportunity for those issues to be pursued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition senator Sarah Henderson, who is on the committee, has condemned Optus for the outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, her sticking point was with the government and the Australian communications and media authority (A-C-M-A), which is yet to testify at the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there was a six-month delay in implementing rules that compel telcos to advise emergency services and the regulator of an outage in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The regulator in charge of this matter is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. That is simply not good enough. We know the regulator also made a number of big mistakes including imposing a range of rules to improve the triple 000 service, but waiting 6 months for that to come into effect - they were made in April and they didn\u2019t come into effect until the first of November - they are really important rules like advising the telco carriers to advise emergency services in real time when there is a triple zero outage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has been leading the senate inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe focus is on the timeline of when Optus CEO Stephen Rue learned deaths were linked to the outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rue has told the inquiry that senior management were informed in an email after midnight, a message that they read the next morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chief executive says he himself learned the news at about 8:15 am on September 19 \u2014 12 hours after Optus was aware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that was not until the following day, and the following day was when we were aware of the events that had unfolded and the information was fast coming to light. But it was fast coming to light as they do in these kind of circumstances unfortunately.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Mr Rue call the regulator? No.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid he call the Communications Minister Annika Wells?

Meanwhile, the federal govt, the regulator, the minister were left in the dark. The information you told them the day before was wrong.

The judgement I had was that it was best to get the information accurately together and then inform the regulator, the department and minister\u2019s office.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal Senator Sarah Henderson has asked how Optus never detected the outage on its own - and why the telco had not been testing its triple zero calls during a firewall upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has also asked why Mr Rue should keep his job.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus chairman John Arthur says that Rue was hired to fix these failures and expects him to finish the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rue has stood by his leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do believe that another change of leadership would actually set back that plan which would not be good for customers and the telecommunications sector.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue of compensation has also arisen during the hearing, and whether or not it has been offered to the families.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The incentives While Australia had high hopes entering the Asia-Oceania Flag Football Championships in their bid to qualify for the World Cup, Stegman sensed their rivals had largely written them off. It made the triumph all the sweeter. \u201cThe moment itself was pure jubilation,\u201d he said. Jared Stegman in action for Australia at the Asia-Oceania Flag Football Championships.\n\n\u201cThe women\u2019s team was there as well and have been a big factor in our lead-up, so they came onto the field and everyone was getting around each other. \u201cIt was unexpected, from our own expectations and training it was expected, but no one thought in their wildest dreams we\u2019d be gold medallists.\u201d Stegman has been involved in American football for 18 years. The 35-year-old has plied his trade around the globe \u2013 playing in Australia, Turkey, Sweden, Japan and Germany. But never had an Olympics tilt crossed his mind.\n\nLoading \u201cIt\u2019s definitely given me a new purpose. I\u2019m a high school head of department for English and playing football for fun, and this has started a new fire,\u201d Stegman said. \u201cI always wanted to play for the challenge, which is why I went overseas, because American football is not well regarded, funded and overly competitive here, so this new opportunity is amazing. \u201cThe chance is crazy, it\u2019s unbelievable, and we\u2019ve achieved the first step.\u201d This year, the NFL announced it would release its players to make them available for selection at the LA Games, opening the door for Australian prospects to take on the best of the best on their home turf, such as three-time Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes.\n\nPathways through the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the US also present study and travel opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people trying to get into the Australian team because they see this as a shot to go to the Olympics, and particularly to play the US guys in LA,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt transcends a lot of sports.\u201d Rival code raid Kelly had previously declared Australian stars such as Sydney Rooster-turned-Wallaby Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii and rugby sevens weapon Maddison Levi would be tailor-made for flag football.\n\nNow, he said, \u201cyou could name 1000\u201d. Those to make the jump included former Wallabies star Quade Cooper, Essendon Bombers Victorian Football League talent Jacob Atley and St George-Illawarra Dragons under-21s winger Caine Barnes. Cooper did not feature at the oceania championships, having returned to Japan where he plays for the Kintetsu Liners rugby union side. Kelly said his impact at a training camp in the US was profound. Quade Cooper is \u201cin the mix\u201d for the flag football World Cup. Credit: Getty \u201cHe was phenomenal. The one thing Quade brings is preparation \u2013 the guy is meticulous with his preparation and thought process, and that was really beneficial for our young guys and girls,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the mix for the World Cup next year, but it\u2019s a very hard team to get into on the back of that performance.\u201d Stegman said the transferable skills with other football codes would make the shift appealing, with Aussie rules athletes in particular blessed with the attributes needed to thrive. \u201cTheir skill set is perfect for flag football, they\u2019re just so trained to catch and trap the ball, and every route you run you\u2019re leading for the ball,\u201d he said. Transferable skills include line running, catching ability and aerial prowess, while being able to respond to 360-degree opposition pressure.\n\nGrowing Australian presence Since flag football\u2019s inclusion on the Sporting Schools program, Kelly revealed more than 50,000 juniors had come through the ranks across just five terms. In his words, \u201cit\u2019s exploded\u201d. Loading When the Philadelphia Eagles conquered Kansas City in this year\u2019s Super Bowl, 2.6 million people in Australia watched. As Melbourne prepares to host an LA Rams game in 2026 at the MCG, Kelly anticipated the game\u2019s popularity would hit new heights.",
