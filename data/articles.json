(ABC South West WA: Kate Forrester)\n\nEat Sustainably nutritionist Amelia Harray said sheep's milk had a higher percentage of protein than milk produced by cows or goats.\n\n\"With that comes a higher amount of calcium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, and all these other really essential nutrients that our bodies need to stay well each day,\" Dr Harray said.\n\n\" One glass of sheep's milk provides Australian adults with about 50 per cent of their calcium requirements, so this is huge in terms of people's bone health. \"\n\nSheep being milked at Cambray Cheese in WA's South West.

She even came close to giving up painting altogether.\n\nIt was listening to Barton's song 'Birdsong at Dusk' that inspired her to paint with her fingers instead of a brush.\n\n\"Without a brush, painting was almost painless. As the portrait painted itself, I felt alive in a way I hadn't for a very long time,\" she wrote.\n\nSpirovski's win for People's Choice follows Julie Fragar winning the $100,000 Archibald Prize in May, for her portrait of artist Justene Williams, becoming the 13th woman to win the prize in 104 years.

        "text": "US jeans brand American Eagle is facing accusations its new ad campaign featuring Sydney Sweeney is \"tone deaf\" and promotes eugenics theory.\n\nThe advertising campaign, which launched this week, features the blonde-haired and blue-eyed actor dressed in denim and it bears the tagline: \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\"\n\nThe company saw a 10 per cent surge in sales after the advertisement's release. However, the campaign has faced mixed reviews online, with some social media users saying it alludes to theories of racial superiority.\n\nHere's why.\n\nSydney Sweeney has 'great jeans'\n\nThe advertising campaign features several videos in which the company uses \"genes\" and \"jeans\" in a play on words.\n\nSeveral videos show Sweeney, dressed head to toe in denim, discussing how great her genes/jeans are while playing with a puppy or starting up a Ford Mustang.\n\n\"Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour,\" she says in another video which has since been removed.\n\n\"My jeans are blue.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBut some critics online say the ads allude to eugenics, a theory popular among white supremacists, that suggests the human race could be improved by breeding out \"less desirable traits\".\n\n\"After watching the full thing, I was a bit confused because I thought, 'OK it's not about selling jeans, it was about Sydney Sweeney,' and I took a step back and analysed the symbols and language used,\" TikTok creator and activist Jeff Kissubi said.\n\n\"She's obviously conventionally attractive but it was what they considered great genes. Pale skin, blonde hair, blue eyes.\n\n\"When eugenic theory started in America, it was saying that everything that was not centred around whiteness would make your gene pool bad.\n\n\"And it was the word play of the advertisement that subtly mirrored far-right Americana themes.\"\n\n'Valid criticism'\n\nMr Kissubi said, given the current political climate in the US, the reaction online was \"valid\".\n\n\"In a country where identity and belonging are already being weaponised, especially now with the far-right MAGA narrative that is on the rise, I don't think it was this overreaction,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that when people consume things that evoke a sudden reaction, that emotion is valid.\n\n\"When people feel erased and unsafe by what they see, it's very important brands don't exist in a vacuum.\"\n\nLauren Rosewarne, from the University of Melbourne, said while the conversations around the advertisements and race were valid, the negative interpretations of the brand's messaging could have been missed by advertisers.\n\n\"There are focus groups and these ads are never just designed in a vacuum,\" she said.\n\n\"They are shown to groups of people to see what things jump out at them, but this is the danger of social media; you can never focus-group enough people to fully gauge what a social media response might look like.\n\n\"Something that might not seem particularly obvious to focus groups will enter niche parts of social media.\"\n\nShe said advertisers were navigating an era when there were social media users with high media literacy and accounts dedicated to unpicking subtext and pop culture.\n\nA 'divisive' figure\n\nThe advertisement is not the first to cause controversy.\n\nDr Rosewarne said the American Eagle videos reminded her of a 1980s ad campaign for Calvin Klein jeans.\n\nThe advertisement featured 15-year-old actor Brooke Shields and the tagline: \"Nothing gets between me and my Calvins.\" It was criticised at the time for its suggestive nature.\n\nSome TV networks declined to air the ad because of the suggestive double entendre and Shields's age.\n\nBut Shields told Vogue in 2021 that she thought the backlash was \"ridiculous\".\n\nSweeney has also faced controversy before.\n\nIn 2022, she shared pictures of her mother's 60th birthday in which family members wore MAGA-style hats that read \"make sixty great again\".\n\nSweeney later tweeted that people were turning an \"innocent celebration\" into an \"absurd political statement\".\n\nNeither Sweeney nor American Eagle has commented on the backlash to the jeans ads.\n\nAnd the proceeds of the jeans will be donated to The Crisis Text Line, a US charity hotline for people who need mental health support.\n\nDr Rosewarne said Sweeney was \"always going to be a divisive figure\".\n\n\"It also works for her,\" she said.\n\n\"She gets the opportunities because of the decisions she's made and, so long as you don't cross the line where the majority of people think it's quite problematic, throwing caution to the wind is quite seductive in certain markets, and she gets away with it because she's pretty.\n\n\"This is where we talk about pretty privilege \u2026 and that kind of slack isn't given to people who are older or less conventionally beautiful.\"\n\nWhat is eugenics?\n\nEugenics is a racist and scientifically inaccurate theory that humans can be improved through selective breeding, according to the US National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nBritish explorer Francis Galton coined the term in 1883.\n\nGalton believed health and disease, as well as social and intellectual characteristics, were based on genes and the concept of race.\n\nHe advocated for a system where \"the more suitable races or strains of blood have a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable\".\n\nHe interpreted certain physical traits and characteristics as more socially and economically valuable.\n\nThe implementation of eugenics theory has caused widespread harm to marginalised populations throughout history.\n\nPronatalism booming in the US Photo shows A woman with a baby on her back with a rifle hanging on the wall in the background.

And even though the risks for the poster families of pronatalism are real, they are happy to bear them.\n\nThe movement gained traction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and some leaders and intellectuals believed the use of methods such as involuntary sterilisation, segregation and social exclusion would rid society of individuals deemed by them to be unfit.\n\nThe theory was so prevalent in America in the early 1900s that it was supported by US president Woodrow Wilson and prominent families such as the Rockefellers.\n\nThe most radical interpretation of the theory came during the Holocaust, when a large number of Nazi persecutory policies stemmed from theories of eugenics.\n\nIn Germany, the term was largely referred to as \"racial hygiene\" and it influenced the thinking of Adolf Hitler who blended racial antisemitism with eugenic theory, according to the US Holocaust Museum.\n\nHe used it to justify the Nazis's treatment of Jews, disabled people and minority groups.\n\n'Shifting climate'\n\nThe Trump administration has been accused of \"dog whistling\" to the far-right movement through its policies targeting diversity and inclusion programs.\n\nShortly after taking office, US President Donald Trump signed executive orders cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nAt Mr Trump's inauguration, the former head of his Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, was accused of making a Nazi salute, a claim he denied.\n\nAnd in February, US Vice-President JD Vance courted the leader of Germany's far-right, anti-immigration AfD party, which Germany's spy agency has labelled racist and \"extremist\".\n\nSome marketing experts say they have observed a shift in the industry since Mr Trump returned to office.\n\nJazmin Burell, a founder of a brand consulting agency in the US, told AP she had noticed more advertisements featuring white models.\n\n\"I can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\" she said.",

        "text": "Traditional owners in Western Australia's far north say they are growing increasingly concerned over seafood giant Tassal's plans to expand its fish farming operation off the remote Kimberley coast.\n\nKnown for its salmon farming off Tasmania, Tassal has been seeking to expand its 32-cage barramundi operation centred on the iconic farm at Cone Bay.\n\nThe company is seeking to add seven fish farms, comprising 84 cages, to its holdings in the surrounding waters off the coast.\n\nTassal already owns a 32-cage barramundi operation at Cone Bay. (Supplied: Marine Produce Australia)\n\nWA's Environmental Protection Authority is assessing the proposal.\n\nWith the company's record in Tasmania attracting significant controversy, the Dambimangari Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the region's traditional owners, is concerned the farm's expansion could undo years of conservation work in the Buccaneer Archipelago.\n\nIndustry vs sanctuary\n\nComprising more than 1,000 scattered islands, the archipelago contains three marine parks across 600,000 hectares, co-designed and jointly managed by the area's Bardi Jawi, Mayala and Dambimangari traditional owners.\n\nTassal's facility falls on Mayala country, with the company signing an Indigenous Land Use Agreement with the group last year.\n\nBut the broader potential impact on the marine park has representatives of the neighbouring cultural groups concerned.\n\nDambimangari board member and marine park chair Francis Woolagoodja said conservation needed to be prioritised.\n\nFrancis Woolagoodja says he does not support Tassal's plans. (Supplied: Dambimangari Aboriginal Corporation)\n\n\"Where does the barramundi industry fit within conservation and looking after country?\" he said.\n\n\" It contradicts what we've been trying to do when you put a barramundi zone right next to a sanctuary zone, which are two opposite things. \"\n\nMr Woolagoodja said the issues surrounding salmon farming in Tasmania were the \"elephant in the room\".\n\n\"We don't want what's happening in Tasmania to happen to the Kimberley coast,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not supportive of what they're doing over in Tasmania \u2026 we're hearing it really has impacted coastlines, so we're mindful of those things.\"\n\nThe archipelago off the north-west coast is used by traditional owners for hunting and customary activities, as well as for tourism and recreational and commercial fishing. (Supplied: Air Kimberley)\n\nMr Woolagoodja said he was not against the creation of jobs and development, but he held concerns around the scale of the expansion.\n\n\"Something huge around barramundi, which will really impact country \u2014 that's opposite to what government's been doing with us for the last 15 years,\" he said.\n\n\"We think the government wouldn't contradict everything they've done \u2026 and we will try to find a middle ground.\"\n\nFishers concerned\n\nWith the archipelago a popular destination, recreational fishers in Broome and Derby are also concerned about the farm's potential impact.\n\nRecfishwest operation leader Matt Gillett said many local fishers wanted the Kimberley to \"remain untouched and accessible\".\n\nTassal bought the Cone Bay barramundi farm in 2023. (Supplied: MainStream Aquaculture)\n\n\"Kimberley fishers love this area \u2026 one of the last things they want is aquaculture facilities that impact access to their favourite fishing spots,\" he said.\n\nMr Gillett said fishers' access to the region, already restricted by the marine park, should not be impacted further.\n\nBut Broome Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Sharni Foulkes said the expansion could offer tourism and employment opportunities.\n\n\"These guys aren't your mum and dad operators, this is a big corporate promising 140 new jobs,\" she said.\n\n\" The Kimberley could be on the map internationally for our barramundi supply, and if that bolsters tourism because people will try our seafood and eat at our restaurants, then I think they've done a fantastic job. \"\n\nMs Foulkes said she believed investing in the state's aquaculture industry was a crucial first step in economic diversification.\n\n\"They [Tassal] want to support skilled development and support career pathways for local people, which is an important opportunity the region needs to grab hold of and support,\" she said.\n\nTassal says project 'exciting' for region\n\nA Tassal spokesperson said the project was an exciting opportunity for the region, contributing to job growth and investment in local suppliers.\n\nCascade Bay is a popular destination for recreational fishers in the archipelago. (ABC Kimberley: Ben Collins)\n\n\"The footprint of the project removes around 400 hectares from the proposal previously submitted by the past operators, recognising concerns raised by important local stakeholders such as traditional owners and recreational fishers,\" they said.\n\n\"We are proud and humbled to have secured the consent for the project via a voluntary Indigenous Land Use Agreement with the Mayala traditional owners on whose country the proposal is wholly located.\"\n\nA WA government spokesperson said the EPA was assessing potential impacts to marine environmental quality, benthic communities and habitats, and marine fauna from the operation of aquaculture sea cages.\n\nThe full report on Tassal's proposal is due by the end of 2025.",

(720 ABC Perth: Emma Wynne)\n\nMr McGlue said councils could, for example, provide automatic exemptions for approval of the removal of trees under a certain height.\n\nFears over fallout\n\nThe property owner at the centre of the SAT decision, Lisa Zorzi, said she bought the land to build a home for her family.\n\nShe wanted to remove the tree because she felt it was not able to be maintained, and was worried it posed safety risks to her and her neighbours.\n\nThe Town of Cambridge adopted a policy of protecting large trees to maintain the area's green canopy. (ABC News: Glyn Jones)\n\nShe also had trouble getting insurance given the breadth of the canopy.\n\nMs Zorzi is worried the legal implications that may flow from her taking her case to the SAT, despite it ruling in her favour, could impact other property owners negatively.\n\n\"I think it's taking away a lot of property owners' rights, and it's also forcing them to take on risk and liability that they're not necessarily comfortable with,\" she said.\n\n\"They're going to have to put up with that for the rest of their life, or the time they own that property, which is really scary for someone who's invested a lot of their livelihood into [a] property in WA.\"\n\nMs Zorzi also felt targeted and \"dehumanised\" by some environmental groups during the saga.\n\n\"I believe that true change, and true policy change, occurs through respectful decision-making, and taking into account everybody's point of view,\" she said.\n\nWALGA welcomes ruling\n\nThe WA Local Government Association welcomed the SAT's decision, saying it supported its view that the removal of a single tree should require approval.\n\n\"WALGA has for many years been calling for stronger protections of trees on private land,\" WALGA president Karen Chappel said in a statement.\n\n\" It is acknowledged that the majority of tree loss occurs on private land in WA, and that without addressing this trend, our urban canopy will continue to decline. \"\n\nWALGA's policy, so far adopted by six councils across Perth including the Town of Cambridge, sets out rules for which trees should be preserved.\n\nThese include:\n\nIs 8m or more high; and/or\n\nhas an average canopy diameter of at least 6m; and/or\n\nhas a truck circumference of at least 1.5m, measured 1.4m above the ground; and\n\nis of a species that is not included on State or local area weed register.\n\nThe West Australian Tree Canopy Advocates (WATCA) group also lauded the SAT's ruling as a \"landmark\" precedent.\n\nSarah Allchurch says the ruling gives local governments \"real teeth\" when it came to protecting trees. (ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\nWATCA chair Sarah Allchurch said it gave local planning policies \"real teeth\".\n\n\"It means no one can bust out the chainsaws and clear-fell trees over 8 metres, because the trees are deemed to be a community asset, even on private land,\" Ms Allchurch said.\n\nLoading...",

(ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\n\"We've had no productive reforms in this state to drive wages above inflation and create prosperity for the people [since 2017].\n\n\"I welcome the lead of Jim Chalmers's roundtable to boost productivity and real wages because we have not seen any initiative from WA Labor.\"\n\nBand-aids ripped off\n\nAt the end of the day, though, yesterday's inflation numbers show Western Australians not only endured the second-worst increase in cost of living over the past five years, but also the longest period of pressure.\n\n\"Effectively, in one way, [the electricity credits] delayed the pain that households are experiencing and they'll have to contend with that now,\" Mr Liveris said.\n\n\" So the situation that we've got [from government power credits] has meant that the pain is actually prolonged when it comes to the cost-of-living issues. \"\n\nRipping off the multi-billion-dollar power bill credit band-aids was always going to hurt.\n\nThe question, which can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight, is whether that support was ultimately well-timed to suppress what could have been an even worse cost-of-living crisis, or whether it could have been better managed to prevent such a harsh end.\n\nInflation eased further in the June quarter, but Western Australia led the nation. (Reuters: David Gray)\n\nThe next challenge for the government to confront is how to help wages catch up with inflation in the long term and really share the prosperity of the nation's richest state with those who have helped create it.",

        "text": "\u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. \u201cBut, it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,\u201d he said. It might not be until well into next year or even beyond that a clearer picture of the effects of the trade wars and whether they are transitory or entrenched is available. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to see the data, and it can go in many different directions. We\u2019re going to make a judgement based on all of the data.\u201d The data to date appears benign. The economy grew at an apparently very robust 3 per cent annualised rate in the June quarter, prompting the White House to claim it as evidence that Trump\u2019s policies have ignited a new \u201cGolden Age.\u201d\n\nBeneath the headline number, however, things weren\u2019t quite as golden. In the first quarter of the year the economy actually contracted, as companies front-loaded their imports to get in ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs. In the June quarter, those bloated inventories were run down and imports fell away. If the first half is looked at as a whole, the economy grew at an annualised rate of 1.25 per cent. In the same half last year, when Joe Biden was in the White House, it grew at 2.3 per cent. Moreover, the US inflation rate, at 2.7 per cent, is still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 per cent and, even before the bulk of Trump\u2019s tariffs are active, there are signs of tariff-related goods inflation. To date, on the available data, there is no evidence of a need to reduce rates. Indeed, a case could be mounted for a rate rise. Powell said he still expected tariffs to flow through to consumer prices but that the process might be slower than expected and that some companies might be finding it difficult to fully pass on the costs to consumers because consumers were unwilling or unable to pay higher prices.\n\nA case in point is the US car manufacturing sector, where the companies have yet to raise their prices despite substantial tariff-related cost increases. General Motors has estimated the tariffs will cost it between $US4 billion and $US5 billion ($6.2 billion-$7.8 billion) this year. Ford said on Wednesday that the tariffs would cost it $US3 billion this year. Loading Some US companies are starting to raise prices. Amazon, Walmart and other retailers have said they will have to raise some prices and, also on Wednesday, the giant consumer products group, Procter & Gamble, said it would raise prices on about a quarter of its product range because it expects a $US1 billion hit from the tariffs. In theory, the tariffs should produce a one-time impact on prices and inflation. The complex layers of duties Trump has imposed on raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods, the messy way in which the tariffs are being rolled out and the degree of uncertainty in what the final trade picture will look like, given the key deals with major trading partners are more statements of intent rather than conventional detailed and binding trade agreements, however, complicates evaluations of their effects.\n\nPowell said it was a \u201cvery dynamic time\u201d for trade negotiations but \u201cwe are still aways away from seeing where things settle down.\u201d \u201cWhat we see now is, basically, the very beginning of whatever the effects turn out to be on goods inflation. They may be less than people estimate, or more than people estimate. They are not going to be zero. \u201cConsumers will pay some of this. Businesses will pay some of this. Retailers will pay some of this. We\u2019re just going to have to see it through,\u201d he said. Trump has been piling on the pressure on Powell, even using a blowout in the costs of the Fed\u2019s renovations of its Washington headquarters to try to pressure him to resign or provide an excuse to fire him \u201cfor cause.\u201d\n\nHe wants lower interest rates to help generate greater economic growth and lower the cost of servicing the US government\u2019s soaring debt levels \u2013 debt that will increase substantially as a result of his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d that cut taxes and increased spending. Powell said the government\u2019s interest costs weren\u2019t something the Fed took into account. \u201cWe have a mandate and that\u2019s maximum employment and price stability. We don\u2019t consider the fiscal needs of the federal government. It\u2019s just not something we take into consideration,\u201d he said. He also left open the possibility that, after his term as chair ends next year, he might serve out the rest of his term as a governor, which doesn\u2019t end until 2028, despite the administration saying that he should, as other chairs have, leave the board when he relinquishes the chair. Trump is going to appoint a successor to Powell who will do his bidding, or at least try to. The administration expects to appoint that person in the near term and hopes that they will, before they displace Powell, effectively become a \u201cshadow\u201d chair whose views influence the Fed and markets and overshadows Powell\u2019s.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The turtleneck has escaped its style sentence as the trusty uniform for women of a certain age who imagine that they\u2019re Diane Keaton in a romantic comedy and computer nerds following in the white sneaker steps of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Also known as the skivvy or polo neck, the turtleneck received a get-out-of-fashion-jail-free card at the Celine runway presentation in Paris during the most recent haute couture season. Extravagant gowns encrusted with pearls or diamonds usually steal the haute couture show, but the debut of American designer Michael Rider at the French fashion house placed humble white turtlenecks front and centre.

Credit: Bec Parsons Rider may have been inspired by former Celine designer and turtleneck devotee Phoebe Philo but his runway masterclass restored the wardrobe staple of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe to its former free-spirited glory. Here\u2019s how to style a turtleneck and keep your cool while staying warm. For beginners: On its own The easiest way to embrace the turtleneck is to wear it with jeans or trousers as an alternative to bulky jumpers. Remember to balance out the snug fit of a thin turtleneck with straight-leg or wide pants or jeans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarilyn Monroe wore her black turtleneck with checked capri pants and Audrey Hepburn with black tights, playing a beatnik in the classic musical Funny Face. Most of us are neither bombshells nor beatniks and more than 60 years have passed, so let\u2019s loosen up. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Courtney Zheng \u201cElsje\u201d dress, $600 (belt included). Credit: Bec Parsons One trend from the last millennium worth holding on to is feminist Gloria Steinem\u2019s turtlenecks paired with long, statement silver necklaces from the 1970s. It\u2019s not just groovy, it\u2019s liberating. Intermediate: Beneath a jacket A turtleneck is a streamlined alternative to wearing a blouse beneath a blazer or jacket. When it comes to layering, the thinner the turtleneck the better. A white turtleneck breaking up double denim looks better than Jake Gyllenhaal breaking up fights in Road House. If you\u2019re self-conscious about your curves, try wearing the turtleneck untucked to lengthen your silhouette. Otherwise, tuck it in and break out your best belt. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Deering \u201cGossamer\u201d skirt, $280. Celine \u201cTriomphe\u201d sunglasses, POA. Credit: Bec Parsons\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re after a monochrome approach, pairing a white turtleneck with a white jacket, or a black turtleneck with a black jacket, be prepared to play with textures. The cotton, wool or cashmere (if you\u2019re fancy) of a turtleneck provides a delightful on-trend contrast with a crackly leather jacket or the sleek satin lapel of a dinner jacket. Sharon Stone\u2019s black turtleneck worn beneath a black velvet jacket at the 1996 Academy Awards remains an inspiration to many stylists for a very good reason. Expert: Beneath a shirt The Parisian staple of a white turtleneck beneath a white collared shirt, worn with jeans and leather boots, is the height of trans-seasonal chic. Once again, make sure the turtleneck is fitted but let the shirt billow. Look for a shirt with a classic rather than tailored fit and remember, you can undo as many buttons as you like without having to worry about stiff breezes. Celine cashmere jacket, POA, silk blouse, POA, \u201cMarco\u201d jeans, $1700, and sneakers, $1350. Credit: Bec Parsons A black turtleneck with a white shirt and jeans also works but be careful of straying into the coastal grandma trend, exemplified by Diane Keaton, of white, on white, on white. If you take this path, be prepared for stares and stains. For the office, match your trousers with your turtleneck before layering with a white shirt. Grey and black work brilliantly, with white acting as a crisp contrast. Break out the starch because stiff cotton shirts work best with relaxed knits.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Australia's Sarah Gigante has powered into the leading group at the Tour de France Femmes after a battling display during a marathon 165.8km ride from Jaunay-Marigny to Gueret.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe crossed the line at the end of the fifth stage just behind AG Insurance-Soudal teammate Kimberley Le Court Pienaar, the Mauritian who thus became the first African to win a stage at the Tour de France Femmes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt meant a big move up the general classification for Gigante, the 24-year-old Victorian who climbed from 19th at the start of the day to eighth place, 55 seconds behind Le Court.\n\n\n\nChapman dropped back to finish 54th and and is 76th overall, 24:23 behind Le Court. But her efforts secured her the award for the most combative rider of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 29-year-old Le Court, who led the general classification after stage two but was overtaken by Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), won a breakneck downhill push to the finish that included Gigante, edging out 2023 champion Demi Vollering.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth stage, the longest in the Tour this year, went through relatively flat terrain before three climbs in the final 35km and saw several failed breakaway attempts as the peloton covered 46.5km in the first hour despite multiple crashes.\n\n\n\nGreen jersey holder Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) recovered from a crash to rejoin the peloton, but struggled to keep up after the first climb, ultimately finishing 58th.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Olympic champion Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) abandoned the race after her third crash in three days. Maria Giulia Confalonieri, Elisa Balsamo and Monica Trinca Colonel also quit the race.\n\n\n\n\n\nVos, who stayed in the peloton behind a leading group for most of the race, attacked in the final 15km during the mountainous part of the stage, but fell behind during the final uphill push, dropping to sixth in the general classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nVollering (FDJ-Suez) rose to third overall, while Pauline Ferrand Prevot (Visma-Lease a Bike) moved up to second, sitting 18 seconds behind Le Court in the general classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tour continues on Thursday with a mountainous 123.7km ride from Clermont-Ferrand to Ambert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Three million Australians will have their student debt slashed as Labor passed the highly anticipated legislation through parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs promised to voters, the Albanese government introduced the HECS debt bill to cut 20 per cent from existing university and TAFE debts as its first order of business last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt passed the Senate on Thursday morning, 36 votes to three. Crossbenchers David Pocock, Fatima Payman, and Tammy Tyrrell all voted with the government and the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare said the average $5,500 that Australians would save is a \"big deal\".\n\n\n\n\"That's a lot of weight off their back, and it will help a lot of young people that might be just out of uni, just out of home, just getting started,\" he told reporters before introducing the bill in the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laws aim to reduce student debt as well as reform the repayment system.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's how they'll work.\n\n\n\nWhen can I expect my student debt reduction?\n\nThe Universities Accord Bill will apply a one-off reduction to student support loans including HELP, VET Student Loan and the Australian Apprenticeship Support Loan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cut will apply to debt levels retrospectively, before the 1 June indexation, but will take a few months for the Australian Tax Office to implement.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalances are expected to be revised by the end of the year, saving students and graduates roughly $16 billion.\n\n\n\nOpposition education spokesperson Jonno Duniam admitted the Coalition's position was \"a view that was not supported by Australians\", conceding \"we'll work\" with the government.\n\n\n\nHow is the repayment system changing?\n\nThe changes include reforms to the repayment system, ensuring compulsory repayments are marginal, as recommended by the Australian University Accord.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe threshold at which students are required to start paying back their loans will be lifted from $54,435 to $67,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the old system, an Australian earning $70,000 would have paid back $1,750 annually. Following the changes, this will be reduced by $1,300 to $450.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How does a HECS debt affect your home loan borrowing power?\n\nThe measures are a recognition that course fees have increased \u2014 spiking under the Morrison government's Jobs-ready Graduates package \u2014 and younger Australians are paying high fees at a time when they are also looking to buy their first homes and start a family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adjustments do not apply to people earning above $180,000.\n\n\n\nCould other reforms be on the way?\n\nClare has flagged that further reforms are being looked at, particularly concerning the former Liberal government's job-ready graduates program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program aimed to fill skills shortages by making it cheaper to take courses such as teaching, nursing and psychology, while doubling the cost of popular degrees including law, communications, business, humanities and the arts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe universities' accord final report branded the program \"deeply unfair\" last year, recommending that fees reflect future earning potential as part of 47 recommendations to reform the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities Australia chief executive Luke Sheehy has welcomed the HECS bill but called on the government to repeal the jobs-ready graduates scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Chapman, the economist who developed the HECS system, similarly said the top priority should be reviewing the price of each degree, because humanities students finish with the highest level of debt and end up being the lowest-paid graduates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

One of the problems that I've seen for a very long time, has been the lack of Indigenous representation in the key decision making layers of the organisation.'\n\n\n\nHe says bi-culture education is one solution to improve academic performance.\n\n\n\n'The Yirrkala School back in 2021 celebrated eight students who completed year 12 with ATAR scores that allowed them to go into any Australian university, they did so through a two-way bi-lingual program which the community has been driving for many, many years.'\n\n\n\nFiona Longmuir, a senior lecturer from Monash University's School of Education says the results are an annual wake-up call for the sector.\n\n\n\n'It is 100% not a good indicator of teaching performance at all, what NAPLAN tells us most years, is that our system is incredibly inequitable, we need more funding, we need more resources and we need more support for our schools and teachers.\n\n\n\nThe federal government says it has made the biggest investment in public schools ... worth $16 billion over the next 10 years with funding tied to real and practical reforms.\n\n\n\nDespite some stagnating results, however, there were some positive take-aways.\n\n\n\nTwo out of three students were at the 'strong' or 'exceeding' level across all skills while Indigenous students in years 7 and 9 were at the \"Exceeding\" level in writing and numeracy - an improvement over the past three years.\n\n",

        "text": "The Australian government will soon implement social media restrictions for under-16s, as part of its push to protect young people and prioritise \"parents ahead of platforms\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has announced, after months of speculation, that YouTube will be included in its ban , while also tabling which types of online services will be exempt from the rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that social media is doing social harm, and my government and this parliament is prepared to take action to protect young Australians,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday, alongside Communications Minister Anika Wells.\n\n\n\n\n\nWells said the government was \"prioritising parents over platforms\" and that it wouldn't be \"intimidated\" by tech companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are implementing these rules and this law on behalf of parents who want and deserve better protection for their kids online. We want kids to know who they are before platforms assume who they are.\"\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells said the government is putting parents ahead of platforms. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nHow will the ban work?\n\nLast November, the government passed a new law to establish a minimum age of 16 to access social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the world-first legislation, \"age-restricted social media platforms\" will have to take \"reasonable\" steps to prevent children under this age from having accounts on their service.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatforms will face fines of up to $49.5 million for failing to comply with the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to enforcement, Wells described \"working rules\" that will not be \"set and forget\", adding the onus is on social media companies to work with the eSafety commissioner in determining what this looks like on their individual platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Social media platforms have been on notice since December last year that this was coming,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWells outlined four \"reasonable steps\", including deactivating existing accounts, ensuring no new accounts are activated, implementing workarounds and correcting errors.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Will the tech behind the teen social media ban work? These questions remain unanswered\n\n\"Kids, God bless them, are going to find a way around this, and maybe they are all going to swarm on LinkedIn, we don't know,\" Wells said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are meant to be working rules, and they also need to correct any errors as they arise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor users over the age of 16, Wells said the government is awaiting the final recommendations from its age assurance trial.\n\n\n\nWhich platforms will be included in the ban?\n\nAccording to the government, and in consultation with eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, age-restricted social media platforms will include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, among other platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the legislation was passed by parliament, YouTube was one of a handful of platforms listed as exempt because they were \"out of scope\" of the policy. However, last month, Inman Grant wrote to Wells, making a formal recommendation that YouTube be included among the banned platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nInman Grant said the recommendation was based on research conducted by eSafety, which found YouTube was the most prevalent social media platform young Australians were accessing, and also the most frequent place they were experiencing harm online.\n\n\n\nThe restrictions placed on YouTube will allow the YouTube Kids platform to operate, and minors will also be able to watch videos on the website in a logged-out state or under parental supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut under-16s will not be allowed to have active YouTube accounts or subscribe to YouTube channels.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike many of the other platforms included in the ban, YouTube doesn't require users to have an account or be logged in to access content.\n\n\n\nOnline gaming, messaging apps, health and education services won't be included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These types of online services have been excluded from the minimum age obligations because they pose fewer social media harms to under-16s,\" Wells said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All services that meet the definition of age-restricted social media platforms, and are not specifically excluded in the rules, will be subject to the social media minimum age law.\"\n\n\n\nWhen will the ban come into effect?\n\nThe law will come into effect from 10 December this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWells acknowledged \"there is no perfect solution\" when it comes to keeping young people safe online, but that the law \"will make a meaningful difference\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As parents, we are really trying our best when it comes to the internet. But it is like trying to teach your kids how to swim in the open ocean, with the rips and the sharks, compared to at the local council pool. We can't control the ocean, but we can police the sharks,\" Wells said.\n\n\n\nWe can't control the ocean, but we can police the sharks. Communications Minister Anika Wells\n\n\"That's why we will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids.\"\n\n\n\nHow have social media platforms responded?\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said in a statement posted on its parent company Google's blog on Wednesday that the company shares the government's goal of reducing harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens. It's not social media,\" they said, adding the decision reverses a public commitment to exclude YouTube from the ban, and that it would consider next steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle had this week written to Wells, asking her \"to uphold the integrity of the legislative process and protect the age-appropriate experiences and safeguards we provide for young Australians\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company warned it would consider its legal options if included in the ban, warning the restrictions could impact the implied constitutional freedom of political communications.\n\n\n\nInman Grant has rejected claims the decision would impact educators and schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the laws passed , Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it maintained there was a lack of evidence associating youth mental health with social media. Both Meta and TikTok described a rushed process.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Meta announced expanded protections for teen accounts and child safety features.\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has also been featuring ads promoting its educational benefits for teens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from Alex Gallagher and Naveen Razik.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. \u201cBut, it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,\u201d he said. It might not be until well into next year or even beyond that a clearer picture of the effects of the trade wars and whether they are transitory or entrenched is available. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to see the data, and it can go in many different directions. We\u2019re going to make a judgement based on all of the data.\u201d The data to date appears benign. The economy grew at an apparently very robust 3 per cent annualised rate in the June quarter, prompting the White House to claim it as evidence that Trump\u2019s policies have ignited a new \u201cGolden Age.\u201d\n\nBeneath the headline number, however, things weren\u2019t quite as golden. In the first quarter of the year the economy actually contracted, as companies front-loaded their imports to get in ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs. In the June quarter, those bloated inventories were run down and imports fell away. If the first half is looked at as a whole, the economy grew at an annualised rate of 1.25 per cent. In the same half last year, when Joe Biden was in the White House, it grew at 2.3 per cent. Moreover, the US inflation rate, at 2.7 per cent, is still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 per cent and, even before the bulk of Trump\u2019s tariffs are active, there are signs of tariff-related goods inflation. To date, on the available data, there is no evidence of a need to reduce rates. Indeed, a case could be mounted for a rate rise. Powell said he still expected tariffs to flow through to consumer prices but that the process might be slower than expected and that some companies might be finding it difficult to fully pass on the costs to consumers because consumers were unwilling or unable to pay higher prices.\n\nA case in point is the US car manufacturing sector, where the companies have yet to raise their prices despite substantial tariff-related cost increases. General Motors has estimated the tariffs will cost it between $US4 billion and $US5 billion ($6.2 billion-$7.8 billion) this year. Ford said on Wednesday that the tariffs would cost it $US3 billion this year. Loading Some US companies are starting to raise prices. Amazon, Walmart and other retailers have said they will have to raise some prices and, also on Wednesday, the giant consumer products group, Procter & Gamble, said it would raise prices on about a quarter of its product range because it expects a $US1 billion hit from the tariffs. In theory, the tariffs should produce a one-time impact on prices and inflation. The complex layers of duties Trump has imposed on raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods, the messy way in which the tariffs are being rolled out and the degree of uncertainty in what the final trade picture will look like, given the key deals with major trading partners are more statements of intent rather than conventional detailed and binding trade agreements, however, complicates evaluations of their effects.\n\nPowell said it was a \u201cvery dynamic time\u201d for trade negotiations but \u201cwe are still aways away from seeing where things settle down.\u201d \u201cWhat we see now is, basically, the very beginning of whatever the effects turn out to be on goods inflation. They may be less than people estimate, or more than people estimate. They are not going to be zero. \u201cConsumers will pay some of this. Businesses will pay some of this. Retailers will pay some of this. We\u2019re just going to have to see it through,\u201d he said. Trump has been piling on the pressure on Powell, even using a blowout in the costs of the Fed\u2019s renovations of its Washington headquarters to try to pressure him to resign or provide an excuse to fire him \u201cfor cause.\u201d\n\nHe wants lower interest rates to help generate greater economic growth and lower the cost of servicing the US government\u2019s soaring debt levels \u2013 debt that will increase substantially as a result of his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d that cut taxes and increased spending. Powell said the government\u2019s interest costs weren\u2019t something the Fed took into account. \u201cWe have a mandate and that\u2019s maximum employment and price stability. We don\u2019t consider the fiscal needs of the federal government. It\u2019s just not something we take into consideration,\u201d he said. He also left open the possibility that, after his term as chair ends next year, he might serve out the rest of his term as a governor, which doesn\u2019t end until 2028, despite the administration saying that he should, as other chairs have, leave the board when he relinquishes the chair. Trump is going to appoint a successor to Powell who will do his bidding, or at least try to. The administration expects to appoint that person in the near term and hopes that they will, before they displace Powell, effectively become a \u201cshadow\u201d chair whose views influence the Fed and markets and overshadows Powell\u2019s.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The turtleneck has escaped its style sentence as the trusty uniform for women of a certain age who imagine that they\u2019re Diane Keaton in a romantic comedy and computer nerds following in the white sneaker steps of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Also known as the skivvy or polo neck, the turtleneck received a get-out-of-fashion-jail-free card at the Celine runway presentation in Paris during the most recent haute couture season. Extravagant gowns encrusted with pearls or diamonds usually steal the haute couture show, but the debut of American designer Michael Rider at the French fashion house placed humble white turtlenecks front and centre.

Credit: Bec Parsons Rider may have been inspired by former Celine designer and turtleneck devotee Phoebe Philo but his runway masterclass restored the wardrobe staple of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe to its former free-spirited glory. Here\u2019s how to style a turtleneck and keep your cool while staying warm. For beginners: On its own The easiest way to embrace the turtleneck is to wear it with jeans or trousers as an alternative to bulky jumpers. Remember to balance out the snug fit of a thin turtleneck with straight-leg or wide pants or jeans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarilyn Monroe wore her black turtleneck with checked capri pants and Audrey Hepburn with black tights, playing a beatnik in the classic musical Funny Face. Most of us are neither bombshells nor beatniks and more than 60 years have passed, so let\u2019s loosen up. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Courtney Zheng \u201cElsje\u201d dress, $600 (belt included). Credit: Bec Parsons One trend from the last millennium worth holding on to is feminist Gloria Steinem\u2019s turtlenecks paired with long, statement silver necklaces from the 1970s. It\u2019s not just groovy, it\u2019s liberating. Intermediate: Beneath a jacket A turtleneck is a streamlined alternative to wearing a blouse beneath a blazer or jacket. When it comes to layering, the thinner the turtleneck the better. A white turtleneck breaking up double denim looks better than Jake Gyllenhaal breaking up fights in Road House. If you\u2019re self-conscious about your curves, try wearing the turtleneck untucked to lengthen your silhouette. Otherwise, tuck it in and break out your best belt. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Deering \u201cGossamer\u201d skirt, $280. Celine \u201cTriomphe\u201d sunglasses, POA. Credit: Bec Parsons\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re after a monochrome approach, pairing a white turtleneck with a white jacket, or a black turtleneck with a black jacket, be prepared to play with textures. The cotton, wool or cashmere (if you\u2019re fancy) of a turtleneck provides a delightful on-trend contrast with a crackly leather jacket or the sleek satin lapel of a dinner jacket. Sharon Stone\u2019s black turtleneck worn beneath a black velvet jacket at the 1996 Academy Awards remains an inspiration to many stylists for a very good reason. Expert: Beneath a shirt The Parisian staple of a white turtleneck beneath a white collared shirt, worn with jeans and leather boots, is the height of trans-seasonal chic. Once again, make sure the turtleneck is fitted but let the shirt billow. Look for a shirt with a classic rather than tailored fit and remember, you can undo as many buttons as you like without having to worry about stiff breezes. Celine cashmere jacket, POA, silk blouse, POA, \u201cMarco\u201d jeans, $1700, and sneakers, $1350. Credit: Bec Parsons A black turtleneck with a white shirt and jeans also works but be careful of straying into the coastal grandma trend, exemplified by Diane Keaton, of white, on white, on white. If you take this path, be prepared for stares and stains. For the office, match your trousers with your turtleneck before layering with a white shirt. Grey and black work brilliantly, with white acting as a crisp contrast. Break out the starch because stiff cotton shirts work best with relaxed knits.\n\nAdvertisement",
