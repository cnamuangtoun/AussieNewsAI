        "text": "It's not quite a white elephant, but it's an aging, multi-million-dollar Olympic venue that towers over its suburban surrounds in south-west Sydney.\n\n25 years on from the six glorious days of cycling it hosted at the 2000 Games, the Dunc Gray Velodrome now sits empty for much of the week and the 3,000 permanent seats that hug the outside of its bike track are rarely, if ever, filled.\n\nIt's a vast piece of architecture \u2014 cavernous, expansive, echoing.\n\nAnd nowadays often wet, thanks to an increasingly leaky roof.\n\nThe Dunc Gray Velodrome was built for the 2000 Olympics. (Getty Images/Sygma: John van Hasselt)\n\nSince 2007, the venue has hosted the Sydney Roller Derby League (SRDL), whose members play a competitive, full-contact re-imagining of the dramatised, WWE-style 20th-century incarnation of the sport.\n\nIt's full-on, it's uncompromising and it also retains some of the glamour from its previous life as a performance sport, with each player choosing or being given a derby alter ego that informs the way they play the game.\n\n\"It's like playing chess on roller skates while someone throws bricks at you,\" \"Get Bucky\", a long time SRDL member, told ABC Sport.\n\n\"Get Bucky\" has been involved with SLDR since 2014. (ABC News: Scott Preston)\n\nBut above all else, what SRDL members say sets derby apart is its approach to gender inclusivity at a time when mainstream sports are often failing to provide homes for their gender-diverse players.\n\nA world-leading gender policy\n\nIn February this year, SRDL implemented the updated gender policy recommended by the sport's US-based global governing body, the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).\n\nThe policy is considered one of the most progressive in world sport, and encourages the participation of any individual of what WFTDA calls a \"Marginalised Gender\", regardless of their presentation or gender they were assigned at birth.\n\nIt allows for trans women and men as well as non-binary people to play alongside cis women and is at odds with US President Donald Trump's February 5 executive order to exclude transgender girls and women from female sports.\n\n\"Rampage\", a non-binary SRDL stalwart and coach, says the community has provided many of its skaters an opportunity for genuine gender expression.\n\n\"Rampage\" is one of SRDL's senior members. (ABC News: Scott Preston)\n\n\"It provides avenues for people who don't necessarily get accepted as they are in their day-to-day lives to be able to come to a roller derby session and be accepted as who they are,\" they said.\n\nReturning home\n\n\"Commando\" started skating with SRDL not long before their 40th birthday.\n\n\"Since my mid to late teens, I've always described my gender as mine,\" Commando said.\n\n\"I knew I wasn't a man, I didn't feel like I was a woman.\n\n\"I wasn't either \u2014 but I also wasn't necessarily in the middle.\"\n\nCommando found SRDL not long before their 40th birthday. (ABC News: Scott Preston)\n\nAfter years spent running nightclubs in the gothic and industrial music scenes, they said finding roller derby and the wider queer community was vital to better understanding their relationship with gender.\n\n\"I realised that I'm not by myself, I'm not someone with a gender that's just mine,\" Commando said.\n\n\"There's a lot of us who don't live within the gender binary and there is terminology that we can use.\"\n\nHowever, while Commando has always felt at home within the Sydney roller derby community, previous gender policies had meant things had not always been so straightforward on court.\n\nThe WFTDA gender policy has evolved alongside its community. (ABC News: Scott Preston)\n\nThe WFTDA's first gender statement was published in 2011. At the time, it was one of the most progressive policies in the world and included protections for trans women within it.\n\nBut a reliance on an individual having \"sex hormones that are in the medically acceptable range for a female\" meant that people like Commando were excluded.\n\nSince then, the WFTDA policy has evolved alongside its community, with subsequent updates removing any reference to hormones and furthering protections for trans and gender-non-conforming athletes.\n\n\"Now, if you feel like WFDTA League is your home, then that's your home, and that's all that WFTDA cares about,\" Commando said.\n\n\"There's a lot of things to love about that.\n\n\"For me personally, it means that I've been able to return home.\"\n\nThe changes to the WFTDA gender policy have meant Commando has been able to \"return home\". (ABC News: Scott Preston)\n\nRyan Storr, an academic with the Sport Innovation Research Group at Swinburne University, says \"fringe\" sports such as roller derby are consistently over-represented when it comes to queer and gender-diverse sporting participation, largely due to their willingness to evolve with their communities.\n\n\"When issues arise, they're more likely to work through a solution and amend and update practices to reflect that,\" Dr Storr said.\n\n\"Whereas mainstream sports are more likely to be 'these are the rules, we can't do anything about it.'\"\n\nThe growth of LGBTQIA+ sport on the fringes\n\nIn recent years, many smaller, newer sports have experienced significant growth within LGBTQIA+ communities.\n\nDr Storr was the lead researcher on the 2024 Free to Exist Report.\n\nIt found 53 per cent of LGBTIQA+ young people had witnessed discrimination within sport settings and 40 per cent had experienced discrimination.\n\nDr Ryan Storr says niche sports can be more responsive to the needs of their communities. (Supplied: Ryan Storr)\n\nDr Storr said that because niche sports were newer, they were more able to design structures and programs that were inclusive, while it was also in the best interest of a growing sport to be more malleable to the evolving needs of its community.\n\n\"I think mainstream sports are very much like 'oh, we've got enough' or 'this is too hard,'\" Dr Storr said.\n\n\"Whereas, from my experience, those smaller sports don't see it like that \u2014 they work through and see what they can do to get a person playing.\"\n\nKade Matthews is the community engagement officer at Proud 2 Play \u2014 a not-for-profit co-founded by Dr Storr that fights LGBTQIA+ discrimination in sport \u2014 and is also the co-founder of Australia's first LGBTQIA+ ice hockey club, Southern Lights.\n\nSince 2019, Southern Lights has grown to encompass 140 players across seven teams in Melbourne and has promoted the creation of a Sydney sister club, Harbour Lights.\n\nMatthews founded Southern Lights in 2019. (ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\n\"Ice hockey has been a really good success because I find that the queer community goes towards those niche sports because they've already been pushed out of many of the major sports,\" Matthews told ABC Sport.\n\n\"So when you're in a niche or a smaller sport, you have more control over the environment.\n\n\"And that means it's easier to find people, easier to find community.\"\n\nAll Harbour and Southern Lights teams are mixed-gender, and teams are delineated on playing ability alone.\n\nAustralia's two LGBTQIA+ ice hockey clubs, Harbour Lights and Southern Lights, get together for the annual Pride on Ice exhibition day in Sydney. (ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\nLaura Morris is a member of the Sydney-based team.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what part of the community you come from, we are able to embrace all aspects of the community based on skill level, based on sex, based on anything,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport? Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\n'Everyone's just as shit as each other'\n\nMany of SRDL's members have been involved in the sport for over a decade. That's despite the fact that many players join the league having never skated before.\n\nRampage believes this is one of the beauties of the sport.\n\n\"Roller skating is such an abnormal skill, it's really a great equaliser for lots of people,\" Rampage said.\n\n\"When you put skates on for the first time, everyone's just as shit as each other.\n\n\"It's phenomenally grounding for everyone.\"\n\nRampage believes roller skating is a very equalising skill. (ABC News: Scott Preston)\n\nFor people who may not have had a sporting home in the past, such a level playing field can be attractive.\n\nAnd with numerous SRDL members preparing for international competition at this year's World Cup, there is clearly plenty of room for sporting development.\n\nGet Bucky \u2014 who has been involved with the league for over a decade \u2014 said that the longevity and loyalty of SLDR's playing base could be largely attributed to its progressive gender outlook.\n\nDiscrimination in sport Photo shows A smiling young person in a roller hockey outfit.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nA performance former captain Michael Vaughan labelled \"Bazball with brains\" ensured a crucial period got off to the perfect start ahead of 10 Tests, with the Ashes series in Australia to come next, which could define the McCullum-Stokes era.\n\n\"Everyone who went out there and got runs read the situation,\" Stokes told reporters after England's Headingley win.\n\n\"We chose our moments to actually put pressure back on them. We could see, in moments where the game could swing, that we needed to assess and hold off on that pressure.\n\n\"Winning any test match is a lot of hard work, but to start a series off with a victory in the way that we've done it here, is very satisfying.\"\n\nStokes was the only member of England's top six not to have a knock of at least 40 runs in the game, but he did take vital wickets in both Indian innings in his second Test back from a torn hamstring.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

'It's just a question about being prudent and careful \u2026 we don't see weakness in the labour market. If we did, that would change things.' He did though go on to add under questioning that 'If it turns out that inflation pressures do remain contained, then we will get to a place where we cut rates sooner rather than later.' However, he stressed that 'I don't think we need to be in any rush, because the economy is still strong.'\n\n\"Several other FOMC officials were also speaking Tuesday and all appeared to side with Powell rather than Governors Waller or Bowman, who either side of the weekend were prosecuting the case for a July rate cut. NY Fed President and heavy hitter John Williams said he believes it 'entirely appropriate' to hold interest rates steady. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said the Fed could be on hold for quite some time. Atlanta Fed President Bostic reiterated his backing for just one quarter-point cut this year. And Governor Barr said monetary policy is well positioned, allowing the Fed to wait, and that second round effects could make the inflationary impact of tariffs persistent.\"",

(ABC News: Nick Dole)\n\nThe government is stabilising debt and forecasting a surplus in 2027/28, the first in almost a decade. But that won't exactly thrill voters.\n\nAhead of every budget, treasurers are inundated with worthy funding requests and often those with the loudest voices win.\n\nSo, it's significant that this time around, the government is helping those who can't speak up for themselves \u2014 the state's most vulnerable children.\n\nFixing a system in crisis\n\nThe NSW out-of-home care system is the biggest in the southern hemisphere, according to the government, with 14,000 children in the care of the state.\n\nLast year, a landmark report revealed the depths of despair it had sunk to.\n\nA chronic shortage of foster carers had pushed more and more children into temporary accommodation like motels and caravan parks, often under the supervision of unaccredited workers from labour hire firms.\n\nThe Advocate for Children and Young People detailed the squalid conditions some children endured, like cockroach infestations and having no access to shower facilities.\n\nOne child said they felt like a \"doggy in the pound pretty much, moving cage to cage\".\n\nThe record $1.2 billion investment announced on Tuesday aimed to turn the system around.\n\nThe government has already made solid progress by removing children from motels and will now use some of the new funding to attract more foster carers.\n\nCole and Gina Young, from Rooty Hill, have fostered many children over ten years.\n\nEmergency foster carers Cole and Gina Young. (ABC News: Nick Dole)\n\nThey're currently caring for a 6-month-old boy who they welcomed into their home straight from hospital.\n\nMr Young said anyone considering becoming a foster carer shouldn't hesitate.\n\n\"It'll be the hardest thing you ever do in your life,\" he said.\n\n\" But it will be the most rewarding thing you've ever done, because you are changing a child's life. \"\n\n\"We all see on TV kids without a home, without a roof over their head in different countries and we say how horrible that is,\" he said.\n\n\"This is Australia and we've got kids like that here.\"\n\nFamilies and Communities Minister Kate Washington said carers young and old, single or married, could become a carer.\n\nNSW Minister for Families and Communities Kate Washington said people should consider becoming a foster carer. (ABC News)\n\n\"If you have got room in your home and your heart, please consider becoming a foster carer. We will support you,\" she said.\n\nA tax-free allowance will rise by 20 per cent, meaning the carer of a typical 14-year old will receive more than $1,000 per fortnight.\n\nAs families face their own cost-of-living pressures, it will still be a major challenge to recruit enough carers.\n\nPeople don't foster children for the money, but the new support will certainly help.\n\nA 'dirty little secret' out in the open\n\nChild protection caseworker Andrea Cartwright said burnout and stress was common. (ABC News: Nick Dole)\n\nThe funding package includes nearly $50 million for government-owned care homes.\n\nThere's also more than $190 million to recruit more than 200 new caseworkers and retain existing workers with higher pay.\n\nAndrea Cartwright, a child protection worker from Ingleburn, said caseworkers experience chronic burnout and stress, with lack of staff meaning they can't perform the necessary welfare checks on children who might be at risk.\n\n\"Hopefully now with this new announcement that's all going to change,\" Ms Cartwright said.\n\nThe winners and losers in this year's NSW budget Photo shows Map on NSW with red -$ and green +$ symbols From education, disaster responses and housing, the NSW government has unveiled its spending and saving plans for the coming financial year.\n\n\"We're no longer the government's dirty little secret.\"\n\nAs with foster carers, there are no guarantees the government will succeed in its recruitment drive for caseworkers, but it's sending a clear signal that it values people doing difficult jobs.\n\nThe funding package is a significant win for Ms Washington who has fought hard within government to repair the crumbling child protection sector.\n\nIt'll be an even bigger win for the thousands of children who rely on it.",

        "text": "Within six weeks of Samuel Paske learning his mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive and rare form of blood cancer, she was gone.\n\nThe sudden loss of the Hobart man's mother triggered a natural response in Paske.\n\n\"I went into 'helper mode' \u2026 I didn't give myself the time to process and then didn't really think about it,\" he says.\n\nStream your favourite shows on the free ABC listen app Photo shows Image of Dr Karl on a pink background and Listen app logo Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks \u2026 and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!\n\nOver the following year, his mental health steadily declined. He was struggling with daily tasks and feeling detached from his life.\n\n\"I was at a point where I was hardly sleeping \u2026 I had this recurring vision of one of my last moments with mum in hospital.\"\n\nWith support from his family and workplace, Paske took time off and started seeing a psychologist.\n\nThe recurring vision of his mother in hospital was playing \"on a loop\" in his head.\n\nSo, his psychologist asked him to recall that vision in detail.\n\n\"He got me to talk through it in minute detail and put myself in that room again. And of course \u2026 I was just a mess. I was very emotional,\" Paske says.\n\n\"He said, 'Just keep on talking, keep on picturing that image in your head. I'm going to hold my finger up in front of you and then I want you to, as you continue talking to me and as you continue to hold that image in your head, follow my finger.'\"\n\nPaske was undergoing an initial session of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. A treatment he says had an immediate impact.\n\n\"My psychologist asked me how I was feeling after, and I was clearly not as emotional as I was 2 minutes prior.\"\n\nWhat is EMDR?\n\nWhile on a walk through a park in 1987, American psychologist Francine Shapiro noticed her eyes moving rapidly from side to side, watching the pavement, while at the same time, disturbing thoughts in her head were becoming less intrusive.\n\nShapiro had a keen interest in the interactions between mind and body through her work, and this observation enabled her to go on and develop EMDR.\n\nEMDR aims to reduce the level of distress and emotion associated with a memory. (ABC: 7.30)\n\nThe treatment is a form of structured psychological therapy that involves a patient being instructed to focus briefly on a memory that may represent trauma or emotional distress. They simultaneously experience bilateral stimulation, which is usually eye movements but can also include the tapping of fingers.\n\nThe aim is to reduce the level of distress and emotion associated with a memory through images, sounds or sensations to help the patient remain grounded in the present while recalling the event.\n\nThe eight-phase treatment is designed to be carried out by an EMDR-trained practitioner, which can include psychologists, psychiatrists and mental health nurses, with a patient over several sessions.\n\nDr Sarah Dominguez, a clinical psychologist and accredited EMDR trainer based in Sydney, views the treatment as \"life-changing\" for some patients.\n\n\"It's not the only intervention I use, but for people that it helps, it's life-changing. For many patients who have had years of therapy and found that other interventions haven't worked for them, it has been great,\" she says.\n\nBut the therapy hasn't been without controversy.\n\nShapiro faced allegations that EMDR was a pseudoscience and not effective, despite having demonstrated its effectiveness through published controlled studies in 1989.\n\nDr Sarah Dominguez says while EMDR has its critics, she believes it can help patients when other treatments have failed. (Supplied: Dr Sarah Dominguez)\n\n\"In the 80s, psychology was very male-dominated,\" says Dr Dominguez.\n\n\"She [Shapiro] had a really rough time, and even now, there are criticisms of it. But it's super cool that this woman just backed herself.\"\n\nOver the years, criticisms of EMDR have included the fact that Shapiro was training clinicians in 1991 to apply EMDR in PTSD treatment while it was still labelled as \"experimental\".\n\nAnd today, some sceptics still wonder whether the eye movement involved is required or is just a placebo effect.\n\nWhile studies have proven EMDR's effectiveness, a 2001 meta-analysis suggested that the eye movement integral to the treatment may be unnecessary.\n\nIn 1995, EMDR was no longer deemed experimental and training restrictions were removed.\n\nShapiro went on to release the guidelines book EMDR Therapy: Basic Principles, Protocols, and Procedures in 1995.\n\nToday, EMDR is recognised as an effective treatment for trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and is backed by the World Health Organization.\n\n'It's made a huge difference'\n\nWhen Melbourne-based model and influencer Olivia Molly Rogers was introduced to EMDR by her long-time psychologist last year, she says the first session \"blew my mind\".\n\n\"The amount of memories that flashed up as we were going through that first session, it was such a crazy experience \u2026 There were things that I hadn't thought about for 20 years.\"\n\nAustralian media personality Olivia Molly Rogers has been sharing her experience with EMDR therapy with her large social media audience. (Supplied: Olivia Molly Rogers)\n\nRogers has recently been sharing with her online audience her experience with EMDR, posting videos explaining the treatment and updating them on how she is finding it.\n\nWhile she says EMDR was initially \"confronting and draining\", she believes it has been beneficial.\n\n\"From the first session I felt different \u2026 After three sessions I noticed a reduction in my general anxiety, but particularly when I think about specific memories,\" she says.\n\n\"It's made a huge difference for me.\"\n\nDr Dominguez says it's natural for EMDR to initially feel challenging.\n\n\"It can be difficult for clients \u2026 even to just think about our past can be really distressing,\" she says.\n\n\"So [a] client needs to really understand that it might make things feel more difficult while they're moving through things, in order to let those memories pass.\"\n\nEMDR enters the mainstream\n\nIn recent years, EMDR has become more well-known across mainstream culture.\n\nPopstar Miley Cyrus is among a string of celebrities who have spoken publicly of their experiences with the treatment.\n\n\"Loved it, saved my life,\" she told The New York Times recently. The star explained that the treatment included visualising herself on a train and watching her memories pass by through the window.\n\n\"It's so weird, it's like watching a movie in your mind,\" she explains.\n\nShe says EMDR helped her with crippling stage fright, something she told The New York Times she no longer experiences.\n\nPrince Harry is another famous figure who claims to have benefited from the treatment after suffering from unresolved anxiety, which stemmed from the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, when he was 12.\n\nPrince Harry spoke about undergoing EMDR therapy in the docuseries The Me You Can't See with Oprah Winfrey. (Supplied: Apple TV+)\n\nIn his mental health documentary series, The Me You Can't See, released in 2021, Harry was shown undergoing EMDR therapy.\n\nInitially, EMDR was developed as a treatment for patients with PTSD, but today the treatment is applied more broadly.\n\nDr Dominguez says it's a common misconception that patients require a significant trauma or PTSD diagnosis to try EMDR.\n\n\"The diagnostic guidelines that we use today, the DSM 5 [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders], say that to have a diagnosis of PTSD you have to have had something horrific happen,\" she says.\n\n\"But that's not what life is like \u2026 You can imagine if you have a child that cries and no-one ever comes to soothe them, that's going to have a lifelong impact for someone.\n\n\"So it [the trauma] is far more about how that person perceives what's happening to them.\"\n\nTreatment can be a 'catalyst' for change\n\nDr Dominguez likens EMDR's impact on clients as a way of making it easier for them to move forward.\n\nWhat's the deal with EMDR? Photo shows An extreme close up image of an eye. You can see the golden brown colour of the iris surrounding the pupil. Michael Baldwin cycled through seven therapists over 22 years. No one could help him overcome the trauma of his childhood \u2014 until he tried EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing therapy).\n\n\"Many of our clients have a backpack of past trauma they're carrying, and [with EMDR] they can finally take that backpack off and live their life.\"\n\nAnd the application of EMDR is widening.\n\nToday, it is often introduced to patients experiencing substance abuse and has been used in treatment for chronic pain.\n\nIt's also been used to help treat \"specific phobias, depression and eating disorders\", says Dr Dominguez.\n\nWhen Samuel Paske reflects on the aftermath of his mother's death, he says he was \"like a ghost\".\n\n\"EMDR, in my case, was the catalyst to snapping me out of it.\"",

(ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nThese charges will be annoying to many, but they pale in policy significance when compared to the novel 'health tax' every household in the territory is about to be hit with.\n\nNot that any government would use or accept the term 'health tax'; the Barr government has opted for the more banal \"levy to support the public health system\".\n\nWhatever Canberrans might feel about paying it \u2014 some may see it as an entirely reasonable contribution \u2014 this non-means-tested annual $250 impost is a most 'un-Labor' thing to do.\n\nIt challenges our federation's compact that Medicare and federal health funding grants funnelled back to the states and territories \u2014 even if inadequate \u2014 are the twin pillars supporting universal access to health services, particularly fee-free care for all in public hospitals.\n\nFor ACT residents forced to pay it, the new 'tax' is akin to a compulsory 'co-payment' for hospital services.\n\nA 'co-payment' charged whether they use public hospital services or not, applied to a population already more likely to pay out-of-pocket fees if they visit a GP, with nationally lagging bulk-billing rates.\n\nDuring the lead-up to this year's federal election, Anthony Albanese railed against anything that resembled an extra payment to access services. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nWhere were ACT Labor MLAs between January and the May 10 federal election when Anthony Albanese pulled out his own Medicare card, extolling Australia's unique health-funding system as \"a declaration of Australian values\" and railing against anything that resembled an extra payment to access services?\n\nThe Barr government argues the $205 million 'tax' (the total to be collected) is temporary, conveniently expiring in the fiscal year in which the next territory election is held, in 2028/29.\n\nThis assumes several entrenched flaws in the ACT's health services are resolved by then \u2014 that demand stabilises, growth in costs slows, and, most importantly, that the Albanese government succumbs to pressure from all states and territories and generously expands total national hospital funding of $34 billion per year.\n\nUnderlying problems to address\n\nChris Steel would be supremely, perhaps dangerously, optimistic if he banked on the Commonwealth suddenly coming to the rescue at a time when it's running its combined deficits of almost $180 billion through to 2028/29.\n\nThe ACT's tax' also has the potential to disadvantage Andrew Barr in crucial negotiations at national cabinet.\n\nThe health levy has the potential to disadvantage Andrew Barr in negotiations at federal cabinet.

Unless there's to be a matching increase in cross-border payments for its residents using the Canberra Hospital, aren't territory residents doing more of the heavy-lifting relative to those coming from elsewhere for treatment?\n\nIf, as is likely, none of these underlying problems are resolved when we reach fiscal year 2028-29, what then?\n\nWould the next territory government have to extend the charge?

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Listing the career highlights of Rhoda Roberts AO would take more space than this page allows. She\u2019s never been content to wear just one hat: the broadcaster, writer, actor, director and producer has been the Indigenous cultural adviser for the Sydney Olympics, Indigenous head of programming at the Sydney Opera House, creative director of the Sydney New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations and much more. Her portrait is even held by the National Portrait Gallery. Despite all this, she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a leader.\u201d So what do you call someone who helped found the likes of the Festival of the Dreaming, the World Indigenous Art Orchestra and the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust? She shrugs off the question. \u201cYou often hear people saying, \u2018Oh, my agent didn\u2019t call me\u2019, or, \u2018I was going to write that book, but I didn\u2019t get the grant\u2019. Well, my motto is, if you work in this industry, just do it. If it doesn\u2019t exist, create it.\u201d The sheer breadth of Roberts\u2019 creative output comes partly from necessity. \u201cWorking in the arts, the reality is you have to be multi-skilled to stay in the industry.\u201d Creating space for First Nations voices has been at the heart of much of her work. One of the reasons she is so committed to providing platforms for Indigenous stories is that many people today are finding their own historical connections to cultures they know very little about. Through ancestry websites and other technologies, someone who has never had lived experience with Indigenous communities can discover that they\u2019re part of that kinship. Roberts is a Widjabul Wia-bal woman who grew up in Lismore. The white side of her family is from Ireland, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t identify as Irish, even though I\u2019m very proud of that Irish ancestry because I didn\u2019t grow up in County Tyrone. I don\u2019t know the country. I know the stories and elements, but I didn\u2019t grow up in that region.\u201d By forging new connections across Australia\u2019s cultural landscape, Roberts equips audiences with the tools not just to understand each other, but to rethink their own position and heritage within the history of the land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so proudly passionate about Indigenous art and culture, festivals, theatre, because we\u2019re bringing something different to the stage that should be part of the Australian vernacular.\u201d It\u2019s also the motivation behind her latest project, a one-woman show based on the life of a family member who rose to international fame but hasn\u2019t achieved the historical recognition he deserves. Frank Roberts at 21 in 1964, then in training for the Tokyo Olympics. Credit: Fairfax media In My Cousin Frank, Roberts takes to the stage to chart the life of Francis Roberts, the boxer who was Australia\u2019s first Indigenous athlete selected for the Olympic Games. \u201cWe had this incredible individual. This is our Rocky,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cAgainst all odds he made it to the Olympic Games. I mean, he couldn\u2019t even travel as an Australian citizen because it was before 1967.\u201d For the 1964 Tokyo Games, Frank had to obtain a British passport. He dined with Emperor Hirohito, but wasn\u2019t even recognised as a citizen in his homeland. Rhoda Roberts was still a girl then, and Frank was just \u201cthe boxing cousin\u201d. She remembers him with dreadlocks in the early 1970s, but as time passed \u201cHonest Frank\u201d fashioned himself into \u201ca dignified gentleman. That\u2019s how his teammates and everyone responded to him. He was truly a gentleman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts was inspired by Frank\u2019s ethos. \u201cI remember being a bit in awe. He just had this belief in being a good human, really. And giving people opportunity. He was really aware of being a great parent, where you really try to do better. And I think that\u2019s what he did, he tried to do better all the time.\u201d My Cousin Frank isn\u2019t merely the story of an individual, but puts Frank\u2019s narrative within the larger network of family and community in which he lived. It makes for a welcome contrast to the heroic myth-making \u2013 \u201cone man who defied the odds to do things his way\u201d \u2013 that often accompanies biographies of sportspeople. TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO RHODA ROBERTS Worst habit? Always feeling compelled to say yes. Greatest fear? Never finding justice for the missing and murdered, with my sister\u2019s loss (the 1998 murder of Rhoda\u2019s twin Lois remains unsolved). The line that stayed with you? My dad\u2019s advice: always remember something you heard that changes how you see everything, and pass it on. Never forget that silence can also have an impact, because you are listening more deeply. Biggest regret? Not spending more time really listening when I was young. Favourite book? Uncle Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu. Such truth that has unpacked history, science and cultivation and given our culture value and us a new self-worth. The artwork/song you wish was yours? Someone\u2019s Always Watching You by Aboriginal artist Digby Moran. What I love is it maps the estuaries of our Bundjalung waterways. There are many of his works, especially those fine diamond and chevron markings he did with toothpicks and highlighted old implements such as a stone axe showcasing the specific art style of our Bundjalung territories. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? Northern NSW pre-occupation of Australia to observe our incredible ancestors. Roberts says that approach is partly due to her own position (\u201cI\u2019m coming from a First Nations Indigenous perspective, a female perspective, dealing with a very male-oriented sport\u201d) and partly because Frank\u2019s story stretches to places far beyond his sporting successes. Frank grew up on the Aboriginal settlement Cubawee, near Lismore, but the year he represented Australia in Tokyo was the same year his childhood home was bulldozed. \u201cThe first elite Indigenous athlete to join an Olympic team was my cousin Francis. And yet when he returns, he\u2019s treated as a second-class citizen. His home is reduced to rubble because the local council don\u2019t agree with the Aboriginal \u2018eyesore\u2019. We were always and still are considered a problem,\u201d Roberts says. The historical policies and practices Frank faced have their place in My Cousin Frank, Roberts says, because their effects are still felt. \u201cHistory is not past because it shapes you. It\u2019s always in your presence. The historical stories we\u2019re told in high school through to the creation truth-telling we were told by our grandparents shaped us ... We\u2019re all moving on, but let\u2019s acknowledge it instead of having this cultural amnesia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\nBefore I discovered teen romance novels in the early 1980s, I wrote my own version of unrequited love in my red vinyl-covered diary about an older boy who went to the private school up the road.\n\nWhile I was still wearing skinny jeans and a pale pink Esprit jumper to primary school, he had graduated to grey flannel shorts, a pale grey shirt and a grey blazer with the arms pushed up. You\u2019d think dressing entirely in grey would have dampened his look, but somehow it didn\u2019t. With golden curls and a flashing smile that I\u2019d only witnessed from a distance, he was perfect teen magazine material. He never spoke to me directly, but his brother and I had been friends when we were little, and his mother had named her prize cow after me, a fact I found both strangely flattering and deeply embarrassing.\n\nAround the time I developed my crush, I discovered the Sweet Dreams book series. If it was the sealed monthly Dolly Doctor column that taught me all I needed to know about sex, it was Sweet Dreams and later, Sweet Valley High that taught me all I needed to know about love. Sure, it was the sort of love that only 16-year-old American girls with flawless skin, perfect hair and eyes that sparkled ever experienced, but I was happy to pretend. And pretend I did. Writing about all the ways my crush would save me when the horse I was riding in the bush bucked me off. The fact that I didn\u2019t own a horse, or ever ride alone in the bush, didn\u2019t deter my fantasy life.\n\nThe cover of the first book in the Sweet Valley High series.\n\nThe first Sweet Dreams book was published in 1981, and I found it a year or so later in the mobile library van. Called P.S. I Love You, it\u2019s the only title in the 233-book series without a happy ending, making it my favourite. Romance was one thing, but sobbing over the impossibility of romance was even better.\n\nThe story of 16-year-old Mariah, who is dragged unwillingly to Palm Springs for the summer with her single mother and younger sister, was a heady read for a 12-year-old. Mariah is openly scathing of the rich families in Palm Springs until she meets the boy next door, who happens to be loaded, lovely and dying. This book cemented my obsession with romance, while also making me terrified that the boy of my dreams would discover a cancerous lump in his neck, too.\n\nThe Sweet Dreams books were mostly standalone romances, written by different American authors. The covers used portrait photographs of teenage girls who I wanted to look like but never did, including Courteney Cox on the cover of The Last Word. The protagonists were always beautiful, and the teenage boys they fell for equally so. And if the girls didn\u2019t start out that way, then they quickly transformed, losing any necessary weight and overcoming their shyness. These worlds excluded anyone who wasn\u2019t the right size, race or look.",

Perfect for the career I\u2019ve chosen. But right now, not all that perfect.\n\nThere\u2019s a cute genre of stories called something like \u201cDay On A Plate\u201d. It\u2019s where a dietician explores what you eat and judges your physical health. Pretty sure my food intake is so normal for an old lady it would bore everyone to bits. Way too many vegetables. Way, way too much oily fish. Not that any of it is going to ward off my genes.\n\nLoading\n\nBut here\u2019s my mind on a plate: stir, reach for phone, open eyes. Check to see if chaos has befallen the world. More accurately as of January 20, check to see what chaos has befallen the world. Read (some of) this masthead, the Canberra Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian. Listen to AM, PM, The World Today. Bit of Crikey. The Conversation. Rolling Stone. The Atlantic. The New Yorker. Check the socials.\n\nOf course, not everything in everything. That would not be possible. I like to watch the sky and the trees and any nearby water. I like to write and cook and talk. My god, I love a chat. A small nuzzling grandchild is an excellent restorative. A small wailing grandchild an even better distraction.\n\nBut over the past two weeks, the doomscrolling, the gloom rolling over, got to me. It got so bad I consulted a psychologist. Well not exactly, but I did call Joel Pearson, professor of neuroscience at UNSW. Pretty much the first thing he asks me was if I\u2019ve ever practised \u201cbox breathing\u201d. Well, yeah, of course. Breathe in for six. Hold for six. Breathe out for six. Hold for six. Think about drawing a box while you are doing it. Six is the goal. Four if I\u2019m feeling impatient.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The assignment: spend a few days off the coast of New Zealand on one of the world\u2019s ritziest cruise ships. Sounds like fun, though I\u2019m not sure how well I\u2019ll blend in with the paying passengers. According to a magazine story I\u2019ve read, Scenic Eclipse II attracts a glamorous crowd: at the ship\u2019s 2023 christening at M\u00e1laga, on Spain\u2019s Costa del Sol, people wafted around the Observation Lounge in chiffon kaftans and the finest pale linens. Accessories? \u201cChanel espadrilles, Herm\u00e8s Apple watches and Louis Vuitton bucket bags.\u201d Yikes. Day One The plane from Sydney descends over snow-capped alps into Queenstown, on New Zealand\u2019s South Island. The resort town is the gathering point for those setting sail tomorrow. At our hotel, notes in our rooms ask us to put our suitcases outside our doors by 9pm. The cases will be transferred to the ship during the night, leaving us with only our carry-on luggage to bring with us in the morning. Uh-oh. My carry-on luggage is a laptop case. No room in there for my PJs, toothbrush and so on. And no time to buy another case. The guy at the hotel reception desk offers me a couple of white plastic bin liners \u2013 the type used in kitchen tidies. I\u2019m grateful, of course, but the prospect of boarding the ship with my possessions in garbage bags casts a slight pall over the rest of my evening. Day Two 9.30am: We board the bus that will take us from Queenstown to the port of Bluff, on the island\u2019s southernmost tip. After a three-hour drive through verdant countryside, we pull up at the dock, and there\u2019s Scenic Eclipse II, towering above us, gleaming and gorgeous. The vessel is 168 metres long and caters for just 228 passengers, compared with the thousands carried by some cruise ships. Its sleek design is said to have been inspired by Octopus, the super-yacht built for Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The magazine story said the only pressure on board was living up to the decor \u2013 \u201cdressing with sufficient style to fit in with the pale-grey marble finishes, Italian Missoni striped cushions and lush abstract art works\u201d. I am thinking glumly of those words as I hoist my garbage bags and trudge up the gangplank. Just ahead of me is one of the other journalists making the voyage, a former editor-in-chief of Vogue Australia, who swans aboard with her elegantly coiffed head held high, a Louis Vuitton carry-all casually slung over one arm. There\u2019s a woman for whom a Missoni cushion holds no fear. Resolve to stick close to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ship has about 180 crew members from more than 40 countries, and many of them are lined up in uniform to greet us. We\u2019re handed glasses of champagne, then escorted to our suites. Mine is the size of a large hotel room, with a compact sitting area and a small balcony. It is smart and extremely comfortable without being over-the-top opulent. Drinks served on board \u2013 apart from a few rare spirits and wines \u2013 are complimentary. 3.40pm: The captain, Torry Sakkariassen, makes a short address over the sound system. He mentions that overnight we will sail through a low-pressure system and encounter high winds as we round the south-western corner of New Zealand. \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d he says in his cheery Norwegian accent. 5.10pm: Don\u2019t Worry, Be Happy is the song playing on the aft deck as we depart from Bluff. Waiters circulate with champagne. No one is wearing a chiffon kaftan. The passengers are undoubtedly affluent: the price of the full journey \u2013 18 days from Queenstown to Auckland, with visits to several coastal towns and a side trip to Norfolk Island \u2013 ranges from $23,645 per person in a suite like mine to $123,260 per person in the two-bedroom penthouse. But they look to me like perfectly normal people. Friendly retirees in jeans and puffer jackets. 5.50pm: In the theatre, waiting for welcome-aboard talks by senior crew, I listen as a silver-haired man tells an evidently hard-of-hearing woman about a cruise to Antarctica he made on this vessel\u2019s sister ship. He tells her about a stop at the remote southern island of South Georgia and the huge creatures that lay in large numbers on the shore. \u201cElephants!\u201d the woman says incredulously. \u201cElephant seals,\u201d the man repeats. 7pm: We journalists meet for a seven-course dinner at Lumiere, the ship\u2019s French restaurant. (I say \u201crestaurant\u201d, but there\u2019s no bill involved. Food and drinks served on board \u2013 apart from a few rare spirits and wines \u2013 are complimentary.) The meal is presented by formally dressed waiters who bring the utmost seriousness to every task, from pouring the French wines recommended by the sommelier to using an eye-dropper to add tabasco to the consomm\u00e9 de queue de boeuf wagyu. That\u2019s oxtail soup, to you and me. By the time we leave the table, the ship is starting to sway a little. In my bathroom, I watch my lipstick roll slowly back and forth on the shelf below the mirror. The Observation Lounge\u2019s plush suites make for a comfortable place to take in the views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDay Three 2.50am: Woken by the ship\u2019s movement. Strange creaking sound coming from somewhere. 7.20am: Press button to raise the blind. Bleak outside, and the sea is still churning. It\u2019s late spring, yet the daily information bulletin I call up on my TV screen says the temperature will peak at five degrees. 8.30am: Make my way to the main lounge, on Deck Four, occasionally putting a steadying hand on a wall. Lurch up to the help desk and ask the person on duty how he rates the present level of choppiness. \u201cIt is very smooth,\u201d he says in a firm, pleasant voice. 9.05am: Captain announces we are entering Milford Sound, and soon the conditions really are calm. Stretching 15 kilometres inland from the Tasman Sea, this is an extraordinarily beautiful place where steep-sided mountains loom over the water and thin waterfalls lace cobweb-like over cliff surfaces. The British writer Rudyard Kipling, who visited in the 1890s, called it the eighth wonder of the world. 10.15am: As we sail further into the Sound, a pod of dolphins appears on our port bow. One of those moments when you almost want to berate Nature for overplaying her hand. Too much! The writer following a trip on one of the ship\u2019s H130 helicopters.

After lifting off from the helipad on Deck Eight, we buzz over inlets and hover beside precipices. In a picture taken by one of the other journalists, I look frozen with fear, but that\u2019s my exhilarated expression. 2pm: Cocktails on Deck Ten. The host is cruise director Chloe Barlow, a vivacious young Englishwoman who doubles as one of the ship\u2019s entertainers. \u201cI am totally in love with ABBA,\u201d she says, and breaks into Honey, Honey. Scenic Eclipse I and II sail the world from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica and almost everywhere in between. Europe, South and North America, Asia, the South Pacific and Australia are all on itineraries. A Scottish couple, farmers from the Borders district, tell me they\u2019ve been on several of the cruises and enjoyed them all, but Antarctica was the mind-blower. 2.50pm: Captain Sakkariassen announces that we\u2019re heading back out to the open ocean, and tonight can expect strong winds with swells of three to four metres. In my suite, I remember that all the drinks in the fridge are free. It hasn\u2019t been stocked with champagne, unfortunately, so I ring Francis, my designated butler, and ask if he could bring some. I\u2019m expecting a glass or a minibar-sized bottle. What arrives is a full-sized bottle of Chassenay D\u2019Arce Cuv\u00e9e Premi\u00e8re Brut. Oh well. Koko\u2019s, where guests can dine on sushi at an ocean-view benchtop. 4pm: Join a tour of the ship conducted by Chloe Barlow, who in defiance of the increasingly heavy weather is wearing high-heeled sandals. \u201cThis is the rockiest ship tour I\u2019ve ever taken,\u201d she says brightly as she teeters along a corridor. 9pm: The ship\u2019s chefs offer a variety of cuisines: Italian, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Indian and so on. At Koko\u2019s, the Asian restaurant, I have delicious Filipino dishes cooked on the teppanyaki grill. Retire to my suite, where I flick through the TV channels, watch the BBC for a bit, then toss back a couple of seasickness tablets I picked up from the help desk. Later discover you\u2019re supposed to take only one at a time. Day Four\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9am: Breakfast at the Yacht Club, the casual restaurant on Deck Seven. As I wait for my order \u2013 omelette with smoked salmon \u2013 I learn that, for some, it was a long and uncomfortable night. A woman from North Carolina, an experienced cruiser, tells me there was a point when she wondered whether she should put warm clothes over her pyjamas, in case we needed to abandon ship. I decide not to divulge that, thanks to the double dose of seasickness tablets, I had 10 hours\u2019 uninterrupted slumber. Honestly haven\u2019t felt this well-rested in years.

Credit: Alamy Stock Photo All is still now, because we\u2019re moored in the lee of Stewart Island, which lies some 30 kilometres off the bottom of New Zealand\u2019s South Island. Nothing much between here and Antarctica. Loading 12.15pm: A few of us clamber into a Zodiac bound for tiny Ulva Island, a wildlife sanctuary just off the coast of Stewart Island. We\u2019ve signed up for a two-hour walking tour. Ulva is home to several bird and plant species that on mainland New Zealand are rare or have died out. Our guide\u2019s enthusiasm is catching, and the pristine forest enchanting. By the time we return to the ship, my hands are so cold I can hardly hold my champagne glass. 5.15pm: Trivia quiz in the lounge. The journalists \u2013 we call our team The Freeloaders \u2013 win the event. Nearly toss a Missoni cushion into the air in celebration. Day Five\n\n\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Loading For a teenager who had not raced senior open races internationally before, he is a world figure already. He is the buzz athlete everyone wants to see, to witness if the talk is real. They now know it is. It\u2019s the speed, the age, the unusual name, and the unmistakable likeness to Usain Bolt\u2019s running style - to say nothing of having bettered some of the world\u2019s greatest sprinter\u2019s achievements at the same age - that make a likeness difficult to ignore and so made the world take notice. Even Gout and Bolt both see the similarity. The race itself on Wednesday (AEST) was mature. An odd word that for a 17-year-old who had to wait until year 12 school holidays to fly to Europe and race, but he ran a composed, mature race. Not overawed by the moment, he had a calm assurance of what he needed to do and if he did that, then he would probably win. He already knows his race. He knows his starts are a weakness but that he comes home strong so if he is within touch coming off the bend, he is confident he will win. It is what he expected in Ostrava and the race followed his plot.\n\nThe query was whether he was fit enough and strong enough against more seasoned runners. He had a blisteringly good summer, but how much fitter and stronger was he now after even a few months of training \u2013 while studying year 12? The answer was emphatically that he is fitter, stronger and quicker. \u201cI\u2019ve felt stronger in training these last couple of months and I\u2019ve felt good since I got to Europe last Thursday,\u201d Gout said. Gout Gout celebrates after winning the men 200 metres during the Ostrava Golden Spike athletics meet. Credit: AP \u201cI knew Mena [Cuban Reynier Mena] would come hard at me the first 100, but I was confident I\u2019d be close enough to come home strongly in the second part of the race, which is of course my stronger part.\u201d As the runners came out of the bend and the stagger evened out, Gout in lane six had moved ahead of the two runners wilting on his outside to only have Mena ahead of him on his inside lane. At the 100m, Mena eased open the gap on Gout slightly for about 10 metres, and it appeared he might hold Gout out.\n\nLoading But this was the mature bit: Gout looked more relaxed and confident than Mena. Gout knew he would come, but you got the sense Mena knew the same thing and tightened up as he tried to strain for the line. By 160m, Gout looked like he kicked up a gear but in fact he was just holding his top-end pace \u2013 a rare thing to be able to do late in a 200 \u2013 while Mena hit the sand and slowed down. By the time they hit the line, the gap was a metre and widening. Gout stopped the clock at 20.02s ahead of Mena in 20.19 and Briton Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake in 20.60. \u201cI felt calm but strong as I came off the turn and was confident I\u2019d be strong enough to get the win,\u201d Gout said. \u201cAnother national record! Pretty happy with that, it\u2019s not a bad first-up in Europe!\u201d The win was not only a first European victory but affirmation that Gout is untroubled mentally or physically by racing the marquee races of Europe against much older and more experienced runners.\n\nLoading He will now stay and train in Europe ahead of a race at the Monaco Diamond League in an under-23 200m race on July 11. That Gout made his European debut in Ostrava and ran a personal best created a further neat synergy with Bolt. Bolt held the 200m meet record of 19.83 in Ostrava that he set as a 21-year-old when Gout was barely six months old. That was in 2008 and later that year, Bolt went on to win his first Olympic gold medal. In Bolt\u2019s first race in Ostrava as a 19-year-old he ran 20.28. Of course, while these stats mean everything and nothing as the portents for Gout\u2019s future, they do provide perspective for how impressive Gout\u2019s performances are when measured against what the world\u2019s greatest had done.",

Eradication of feral animals. I do lots of camera monitoring and data. Lots of fencing. And I also get to jump on board with the ERP, which is the Ecological Restoration Program over at Dirk Hartog Island. And I've done a bit of work with the marine community down in Kensington and a few of the scientists over there as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut her biggest passion in this vast land is people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The favourite parts of my job is working with different people from different walks of life. The wildlife that I get to see, and the Country I get to show all the other guys that haven't been here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Oakley says she started work as a ranger two years ago to get a better connection with the land and bear a unique responsibility passed on by Elders who've cared for the land before her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I applied for the job because I wanted to be out on Country more. I feel it's good for your soul. And I also feel it's up to us young guys to step up and do what our Elders once did. I think the Elders who have passed, or who no longer have the ability to come out on Country because they are quite elderly, they would be very, very proud of not just myself, but my cousins that work in the office as well. It was once upon a time them doing what we're doing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says changes to the way country is managed have opened the door to more work opportunities.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points Iran denies reports of Qatar-brokered ceasefire, despite US President's post\n\nRichard Marles says Australia will choose optimal path in AUKUS submarine deal\n\nAtletico Madrid ousted from Club World Cup\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIran is denying widespread reports that it has reached a ceasefire deal with Israel, brokered by Qatar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe news first broke via Donald Trump on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States president posted on his own platform, Truth Social this morning saying the countries had agreed to a total and complete ceasefire.\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani had reportedly secured Tehran's agreement to the White House' proposal for a halt in the conflict between Israel and Iran, during a call with Iranian officials.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of Australians who have registered for assistance to leave the Middle East now stands at around 2,900 in Iran and 1,300 in Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong says Australia suspended bus evacuations from Israel following the U-S attack on Iranian nuclear facilities but is preparing for potential evacuations if airspace is reopened over Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has also sent two aircraft to the Middle East, to assist with civilian evacuations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister and Senator Wong say Australia's security agency ASIO [[ay-zee-oh]] is continuously monitoring terror threat levels and there are currently no changes to travel advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are always risks - not only from escalation in the region, but also potential risks more broadly. I have indicated publicly that I have asked my department to consider whether - if there is any alteration to travel advice more generally.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles has declined to comment whether the government would be prepared to boost investment in the US industrial base, to secure nuclear submarines.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts have raised concerns that Australia could be forced to increase its investment or miss out on acquiring a vital stop-gap capability.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in London, Mr Marles insisted Australia is focused on pursuing the best path.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the trilateral AUKUS pact, Australia has committed $3 billion to helping the U-S improve its defence manufacturing, in exchange for being allowed to purchase Virginia class submarines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia could potentially have Virginia class submarines from 2032.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are working at a pace to implement the AUKUS arrangement, and this is a major step forward for both the United Kingdom and Australia. I mean - underpinning AUKUS will be the idea that in the future Australia and the U-K will be operating at the same class of submarine. That's a very significant step to take in terms of binding our two countries together and there's much work to do to achieve that.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nA jury which will decide the fate of a woman accused of murdering three people with toxic mushrooms, is set to return to a regional Victorian court this week, to receive the trial judge\u2019s final directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n50-year-old mother of three, Erin Patterson denies she intentionally poisoned four members of her estranged husband's family when she served them a beef Wellington allegedly containing death cap mushrooms for lunch in July 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Christopher Beale is set to spend two days giving his final directions to the jury in the court in Morwell, about two hours east of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe jury will then deliberate on whether Ms Patterson is guilty or not guilty of three murders and one attempted murder.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Queensland state government is set to walk back cost-of-living relief measures when it hands down its budget today, as it looks at long-term budget repair before hosting the 2032 Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland's Liberal National government is promising a \"responsible\" budget, after winning the 2024 election, ending Labor's nine-year tenure.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland Premier David Crisafulli spoke to Channel Seven's Sunrise program earlier, saying they are doing everything they can to fulfill the government's election promise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is to lift home ownership. Home ownership rates in Queensland are at 63.5 per cent. That's the lowest in the country, and my vision is to go from last to first within a decade. And we're doing everything we can to get people into a home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer David Janetzki is looking at bringing down Queensland's projected total debt of almost $220 billion, ahead of the 2032 Brisbane Games.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the former Labor government's 2024 budget, Queenslanders were treated to $1000 energy rebates and a 20 per cent reduction in car registration costs.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in football, a late strike from Antoine Griezmann has handed Atletico Madrid a 1-0 win over Botafogo - but the victory could not save the Spanish giants from a group stage exit at the Club World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Paris St Germain's 2-0 over Seattle Sounders in Monday's other Group B game, the French side finished level on six points with Botafogo and Atletico.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, European champions PSG secured top spot thanks to a superior goal difference, with South American champions Botafogo also advancing to the last 16 after finishing second.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtletico, in third, and Seattle, bottom with no points after three games, were eliminated.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australians are in for a very rude shock when it becomes, this actually perhaps gets implemented and they all of a sudden are being forced to hand over that data to access services that they've freely been able to access up to this point.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Professor Daniel Angus talking about the upcoming implementation of the teen social media ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 11 this year, social media companies will be required to take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent Australians under sixteen from using their platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Angus was one of more than 140 academics and civil society organisations that signed an open letter against the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother signatory was Professor of Internet Studies at Curtin University, Tama Leaver.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that we know very little detail about the ban at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that there's a lot of moving parts. We know that there's a lot of global interest, but we don't actually have the nuts and bolts of how it's going to work as yet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Federal Government passed the legislation last November, they included a twelve month enforcement delay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time would allow for a government-commissioned trial to assess the technologies available, and for the Communications Minister to establish rules for what social media companies can and can't do.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat trial released its preliminary findings last week, announcing that age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts like Professor Angus are sceptical of this claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the key concerns that we have is how the industry often will inflate their accuracy and the utility of these approaches when we know that there are still significant issues when it comes to both gender and also racial biases, but also the general lack of efficacy of these approaches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe digital communication professor says the public have not been well-informed about the likely impacts of these technologies, since to check if a user is under 16, they must also check if they are older than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The greater risk that comes from when we're all, and that's every single person being asked to give over very sensitive personal data to vendors, third parties, perhaps the government just to access basic digital services that we've come to rely on every day and what that looks like.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these concerns, some cyber safety experts like Kirra Pendergast remain supportive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I's like all aspects of technical security, cybersecurity, cyber safety. It's never ever going to be 100%. This is never going to be the silver bullet, but it's a really, really good start because again, it sparked all of the conversations that we needed to have at every level of society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially against the ban based on technical concerns, she changed her view after seeing how parents were struggling to respond to their children's social media use.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Pendergast says the ban has the potential to help parents and educators prepare children for the digital world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's multi-pronged benefits here. It's going to help the parent that struggles with no say, sorry buddy. You can't have it until you're 16. It's definitely going to help there. It's also going to spark big conversations. It's also going to help educators get children ready in time because they're thrust into a world that they don't understand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung people like April Willis are still not convinced the ban will be effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the hard truth is that a lot of us are thinking, 'I would've found a way around it', as I'm sure many young people will. I most likely would not have listened and yeah, I would've joined it somehow some way.\"\n\n\n\nShe says being on social media as an early teen originally gave her an outlet for connection and having fun, but that as she grew up it had an impact on her mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe now 22-year-old works with mental health service ReachOut as a Youth Advocate.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says young people's views need to be included in discussions about how to implement the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Especially now that the ban's been announced, that kind of conversation with young people has come to a halt. And I think it's more important now to have young people and mental health organizations discussing this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians are not the only ones waiting to find out how the ban will work.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand, Greece, France and Spain are among other countries considering implementing similar minimum age bans.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Australia the first country to attempt to implement this kind of policy, the results could have global impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Leaver says for this to work, there is still lots left to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the rest of the world is watching Australia and hoping that this might be a blueprint, we're going to have an awful lot of work to do in the next few months to actually have a blueprint to practically do this rather than simply aspire to giving parents some reassurance, which is what ultimately I think this legislation boils down to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Almost all of Australia's top chief executives are, according to their boards at least, knocking it out of the park in terms of performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is despite sluggish productivity, persistently high carbon emissions, rising inequality and Australia's public spending on research and development being among the lowest in the OECD.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to new data from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, 91 per cent of Australia's top chief executive officers (CEOs) received some form of performance bonus last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat elevated their pay well above their base salaries (which were already over $1 million). Only five CEOs out of 142 eligible for a bonus received zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact nearly all of Australia's top CEOs are receiving these performance bonuses shows performance pay is more about rewarding conformity and discipline than risk-taking and entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\nDo we really believe 91 per cent of our CEOs made big bets that paid off last year?\n\n\n\n\n\nA more plausible explanation is that we simply reward executives for not stuffing up. Their customer base is growing in line with population growth and their prices are rising faster than their cost of production, which means profits rise without too much effort.\n\n\n\nNot keeping up with change\n\nTake the electricity industry for example. It's hard to imagine an industry in which change is more inevitable than the industry responsible for transitioning away from gas and coal-fired power stations to renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the electricity, gas and water industry spends a mere 0.24 per cent of sales on research and development each year. That is half the economy-wide average.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, innovation does not appear to be a prerequisite for CEOs being rewarded with large bonuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Energy Australia, its CEO Mark Collette (base salary over $1 million) recently challenged a room full of other well-paid leaders at Australian Energy Week to continuously ask themselves: \"Will this make energy cheaper?\"\n\n\n\nHowever instead of focusing on keeping costs down for consumers, companies have sometimes resorted to misleading statements. Energy Australia recently admitted to misleading customers by claiming the coal and gas-fired electricity it was selling was \"carbon neutral\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Australia was buying widely used carbon offsets to make the claim the fossil-fuel fired electricity it was selling was carbon neutral. In its apology, Energy Australia conceded \"offsets do not prevent or undo the harms caused by burning fossil fuels for a customer's energy use\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is clear Energy Australia's spending on carbon credits did nothing to make the company's energy cheaper, it is not yet clear if the board will award a \"performance bonus\".\n\n\n\nLeading the world \u2014 in pay packets\n\nAnother example of the lack of relationship between CEO pay and organisational performance is Australia's university sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vice chancellors of Australian universities are among the best paid in the world, with over a dozen Australian earning more than the head of Cambridge University.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO SBS On the Money: Are Australian executives paid too much? SBS News 12/06/2024 12:16 English\n\nBut there is no correlation between student satisfaction and vice chancellor pay.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while Australian vice chancellor pay has been soaring, Australian universities have been slipping steadily down international rankings for university quality.\n\n\n\nInequality is rising\n\nWhile performance-based bonuses and incentives are common among CEOs and vice chancellors, the same is not true for lower-paid staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, these staff are often asked to \"do more, with less\" even as their real wages have declined.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities have seen a notable decline in academic staff per student while the gap between the pay of lecturers and vice chancellors has skyrocketed.\n\n\n\nExtremely high salaries for CEOs and vice chancellors have done nothing to boost Australian productivity growth, or our performance in global rankings for our universities, research and development or innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying out large bonuses for average performance has done little to help either.\n\n\n\n\n\nInequality in Australia is rising. As long as CEO pay is rising faster than the minimum wages, that gap will continue to widen. The latest data showed CEO salaries are 55 times that of the average worker.\n\n\n\nJust doing their job\n\nWhile it is true it is hard to measure the performance of a CEO, it's also hard to measure the care and attention provided by a childcare worker, the compassion of an aged care nurse, the helpfulness of a call centre operator or the enthusiasm of a lecturer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew CEOs think we need bonuses to motivate the vast majority of Australian workers. But it is heresy to suggest those at the top of a big organisation could simply work diligently without a giant bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, it's not just income that is unequal in Australia. We expect a lot more self-motivation from those at the bottom of the income distribution than those at the very top.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Listing the career highlights of Rhoda Roberts AO would take more space than this page allows. She\u2019s never been content to wear just one hat: the broadcaster, writer, actor, director and producer has been the Indigenous cultural adviser for the Sydney Olympics, Indigenous head of programming at the Sydney Opera House, creative director of the Sydney New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations and much more. Her portrait is even held by the National Portrait Gallery. Despite all this, she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a leader.\u201d So what do you call someone who helped found the likes of the Festival of the Dreaming, the World Indigenous Art Orchestra and the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust? She shrugs off the question. \u201cYou often hear people saying, \u2018Oh, my agent didn\u2019t call me\u2019, or, \u2018I was going to write that book, but I didn\u2019t get the grant\u2019. Well, my motto is, if you work in this industry, just do it. If it doesn\u2019t exist, create it.\u201d The sheer breadth of Roberts\u2019 creative output comes partly from necessity. \u201cWorking in the arts, the reality is you have to be multi-skilled to stay in the industry.\u201d Creating space for First Nations voices has been at the heart of much of her work. One of the reasons she is so committed to providing platforms for Indigenous stories is that many people today are finding their own historical connections to cultures they know very little about. Through ancestry websites and other technologies, someone who has never had lived experience with Indigenous communities can discover that they\u2019re part of that kinship. Roberts is a Widjabul Wia-bal woman who grew up in Lismore. The white side of her family is from Ireland, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t identify as Irish, even though I\u2019m very proud of that Irish ancestry because I didn\u2019t grow up in County Tyrone. I don\u2019t know the country. I know the stories and elements, but I didn\u2019t grow up in that region.\u201d By forging new connections across Australia\u2019s cultural landscape, Roberts equips audiences with the tools not just to understand each other, but to rethink their own position and heritage within the history of the land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so proudly passionate about Indigenous art and culture, festivals, theatre, because we\u2019re bringing something different to the stage that should be part of the Australian vernacular.\u201d It\u2019s also the motivation behind her latest project, a one-woman show based on the life of a family member who rose to international fame but hasn\u2019t achieved the historical recognition he deserves. Frank Roberts at 21 in 1964, then in training for the Tokyo Olympics. Credit: Fairfax media In My Cousin Frank, Roberts takes to the stage to chart the life of Francis Roberts, the boxer who was Australia\u2019s first Indigenous athlete selected for the Olympic Games. \u201cWe had this incredible individual. This is our Rocky,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cAgainst all odds he made it to the Olympic Games. I mean, he couldn\u2019t even travel as an Australian citizen because it was before 1967.\u201d For the 1964 Tokyo Games, Frank had to obtain a British passport. He dined with Emperor Hirohito, but wasn\u2019t even recognised as a citizen in his homeland. Rhoda Roberts was still a girl then, and Frank was just \u201cthe boxing cousin\u201d. She remembers him with dreadlocks in the early 1970s, but as time passed \u201cHonest Frank\u201d fashioned himself into \u201ca dignified gentleman. That\u2019s how his teammates and everyone responded to him. He was truly a gentleman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts was inspired by Frank\u2019s ethos. \u201cI remember being a bit in awe. He just had this belief in being a good human, really. And giving people opportunity. He was really aware of being a great parent, where you really try to do better. And I think that\u2019s what he did, he tried to do better all the time.\u201d My Cousin Frank isn\u2019t merely the story of an individual, but puts Frank\u2019s narrative within the larger network of family and community in which he lived. It makes for a welcome contrast to the heroic myth-making \u2013 \u201cone man who defied the odds to do things his way\u201d \u2013 that often accompanies biographies of sportspeople. TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO RHODA ROBERTS Worst habit? Always feeling compelled to say yes. Greatest fear? Never finding justice for the missing and murdered, with my sister\u2019s loss (the 1998 murder of Rhoda\u2019s twin Lois remains unsolved). The line that stayed with you? My dad\u2019s advice: always remember something you heard that changes how you see everything, and pass it on. Never forget that silence can also have an impact, because you are listening more deeply. Biggest regret? Not spending more time really listening when I was young. Favourite book? Uncle Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu. Such truth that has unpacked history, science and cultivation and given our culture value and us a new self-worth. The artwork/song you wish was yours? Someone\u2019s Always Watching You by Aboriginal artist Digby Moran. What I love is it maps the estuaries of our Bundjalung waterways. There are many of his works, especially those fine diamond and chevron markings he did with toothpicks and highlighted old implements such as a stone axe showcasing the specific art style of our Bundjalung territories. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? Northern NSW pre-occupation of Australia to observe our incredible ancestors. Roberts says that approach is partly due to her own position (\u201cI\u2019m coming from a First Nations Indigenous perspective, a female perspective, dealing with a very male-oriented sport\u201d) and partly because Frank\u2019s story stretches to places far beyond his sporting successes. Frank grew up on the Aboriginal settlement Cubawee, near Lismore, but the year he represented Australia in Tokyo was the same year his childhood home was bulldozed. \u201cThe first elite Indigenous athlete to join an Olympic team was my cousin Francis. And yet when he returns, he\u2019s treated as a second-class citizen. His home is reduced to rubble because the local council don\u2019t agree with the Aboriginal \u2018eyesore\u2019. We were always and still are considered a problem,\u201d Roberts says. The historical policies and practices Frank faced have their place in My Cousin Frank, Roberts says, because their effects are still felt. \u201cHistory is not past because it shapes you. It\u2019s always in your presence. The historical stories we\u2019re told in high school through to the creation truth-telling we were told by our grandparents shaped us ... We\u2019re all moving on, but let\u2019s acknowledge it instead of having this cultural amnesia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

You\u2019d think dressing entirely in grey would have dampened his look, but somehow it didn\u2019t. With golden curls and a flashing smile that I\u2019d only witnessed from a distance, he was perfect teen magazine material. He never spoke to me directly, but his brother and I had been friends when we were little, and his mother had named her prize cow after me, a fact I found both strangely flattering and deeply embarrassing.\n\nAround the time I developed my crush, I discovered the Sweet Dreams book series. If it was the sealed monthly Dolly Doctor column that taught me all I needed to know about sex, it was Sweet Dreams and later, Sweet Valley High that taught me all I needed to know about love. Sure, it was the sort of love that only 16-year-old American girls with flawless skin, perfect hair and eyes that sparkled ever experienced, but I was happy to pretend. And pretend I did. Writing about all the ways my crush would save me when the horse I was riding in the bush bucked me off. The fact that I didn\u2019t own a horse, or ever ride alone in the bush, didn\u2019t deter my fantasy life.\n\nThe cover of the first book in the Sweet Valley High series.\n\nThe first Sweet Dreams book was published in 1981, and I found it a year or so later in the mobile library van. Called P.S. I Love You, it\u2019s the only title in the 233-book series without a happy ending, making it my favourite. Romance was one thing, but sobbing over the impossibility of romance was even better.\n\nThe story of 16-year-old Mariah, who is dragged unwillingly to Palm Springs for the summer with her single mother and younger sister, was a heady read for a 12-year-old. Mariah is openly scathing of the rich families in Palm Springs until she meets the boy next door, who happens to be loaded, lovely and dying. This book cemented my obsession with romance, while also making me terrified that the boy of my dreams would discover a cancerous lump in his neck, too.\n\nThe Sweet Dreams books were mostly standalone romances, written by different American authors. The covers used portrait photographs of teenage girls who I wanted to look like but never did, including Courteney Cox on the cover of The Last Word. The protagonists were always beautiful, and the teenage boys they fell for equally so. And if the girls didn\u2019t start out that way, then they quickly transformed, losing any necessary weight and overcoming their shyness. These worlds excluded anyone who wasn\u2019t the right size, race or look.",

As one joker posted last week : \u201cYou\u2019ll be too young to remember, but there was a time when you could wake up as many as three mornings in a row and not find the world had lost its f---ing mind.\u201d\n\nYes, my name is Jenna Price and I am a news junkie. Perfect for the career I\u2019ve chosen. But right now, not all that perfect.\n\nThere\u2019s a cute genre of stories called something like \u201cDay On A Plate\u201d. It\u2019s where a dietician explores what you eat and judges your physical health. Pretty sure my food intake is so normal for an old lady it would bore everyone to bits. Way too many vegetables. Way, way too much oily fish. Not that any of it is going to ward off my genes.\n\nLoading\n\nBut here\u2019s my mind on a plate: stir, reach for phone, open eyes. Check to see if chaos has befallen the world. More accurately as of January 20, check to see what chaos has befallen the world. Read (some of) this masthead, the Canberra Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian. Listen to AM, PM, The World Today. Bit of Crikey. The Conversation. Rolling Stone. The Atlantic. The New Yorker. Check the socials.\n\nOf course, not everything in everything. That would not be possible. I like to watch the sky and the trees and any nearby water. I like to write and cook and talk. My god, I love a chat. A small nuzzling grandchild is an excellent restorative. A small wailing grandchild an even better distraction.\n\nBut over the past two weeks, the doomscrolling, the gloom rolling over, got to me. It got so bad I consulted a psychologist. Well not exactly, but I did call Joel Pearson, professor of neuroscience at UNSW. Pretty much the first thing he asks me was if I\u2019ve ever practised \u201cbox breathing\u201d. Well, yeah, of course. Breathe in for six. Hold for six. Breathe out for six. Hold for six. Think about drawing a box while you are doing it. Six is the goal. Four if I\u2019m feeling impatient.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The assignment: spend a few days off the coast of New Zealand on one of the world\u2019s ritziest cruise ships. Sounds like fun, though I\u2019m not sure how well I\u2019ll blend in with the paying passengers. According to a magazine story I\u2019ve read, Scenic Eclipse II attracts a glamorous crowd: at the ship\u2019s 2023 christening at M\u00e1laga, on Spain\u2019s Costa del Sol, people wafted around the Observation Lounge in chiffon kaftans and the finest pale linens. Accessories? \u201cChanel espadrilles, Herm\u00e8s Apple watches and Louis Vuitton bucket bags.\u201d Yikes. Day One The plane from Sydney descends over snow-capped alps into Queenstown, on New Zealand\u2019s South Island. The resort town is the gathering point for those setting sail tomorrow. At our hotel, notes in our rooms ask us to put our suitcases outside our doors by 9pm. The cases will be transferred to the ship during the night, leaving us with only our carry-on luggage to bring with us in the morning. Uh-oh. My carry-on luggage is a laptop case. No room in there for my PJs, toothbrush and so on. And no time to buy another case. The guy at the hotel reception desk offers me a couple of white plastic bin liners \u2013 the type used in kitchen tidies. I\u2019m grateful, of course, but the prospect of boarding the ship with my possessions in garbage bags casts a slight pall over the rest of my evening. Day Two 9.30am: We board the bus that will take us from Queenstown to the port of Bluff, on the island\u2019s southernmost tip. After a three-hour drive through verdant countryside, we pull up at the dock, and there\u2019s Scenic Eclipse II, towering above us, gleaming and gorgeous. The vessel is 168 metres long and caters for just 228 passengers, compared with the thousands carried by some cruise ships. Its sleek design is said to have been inspired by Octopus, the super-yacht built for Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The magazine story said the only pressure on board was living up to the decor \u2013 \u201cdressing with sufficient style to fit in with the pale-grey marble finishes, Italian Missoni striped cushions and lush abstract art works\u201d. I am thinking glumly of those words as I hoist my garbage bags and trudge up the gangplank. Just ahead of me is one of the other journalists making the voyage, a former editor-in-chief of Vogue Australia, who swans aboard with her elegantly coiffed head held high, a Louis Vuitton carry-all casually slung over one arm. There\u2019s a woman for whom a Missoni cushion holds no fear. Resolve to stick close to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ship has about 180 crew members from more than 40 countries, and many of them are lined up in uniform to greet us. We\u2019re handed glasses of champagne, then escorted to our suites. Mine is the size of a large hotel room, with a compact sitting area and a small balcony. It is smart and extremely comfortable without being over-the-top opulent. Drinks served on board \u2013 apart from a few rare spirits and wines \u2013 are complimentary. 3.40pm: The captain, Torry Sakkariassen, makes a short address over the sound system. He mentions that overnight we will sail through a low-pressure system and encounter high winds as we round the south-western corner of New Zealand. \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d he says in his cheery Norwegian accent. 5.10pm: Don\u2019t Worry, Be Happy is the song playing on the aft deck as we depart from Bluff. Waiters circulate with champagne. No one is wearing a chiffon kaftan. The passengers are undoubtedly affluent: the price of the full journey \u2013 18 days from Queenstown to Auckland, with visits to several coastal towns and a side trip to Norfolk Island \u2013 ranges from $23,645 per person in a suite like mine to $123,260 per person in the two-bedroom penthouse. But they look to me like perfectly normal people. Friendly retirees in jeans and puffer jackets. 5.50pm: In the theatre, waiting for welcome-aboard talks by senior crew, I listen as a silver-haired man tells an evidently hard-of-hearing woman about a cruise to Antarctica he made on this vessel\u2019s sister ship. He tells her about a stop at the remote southern island of South Georgia and the huge creatures that lay in large numbers on the shore. \u201cElephants!\u201d the woman says incredulously. \u201cElephant seals,\u201d the man repeats. 7pm: We journalists meet for a seven-course dinner at Lumiere, the ship\u2019s French restaurant. (I say \u201crestaurant\u201d, but there\u2019s no bill involved. Food and drinks served on board \u2013 apart from a few rare spirits and wines \u2013 are complimentary.) The meal is presented by formally dressed waiters who bring the utmost seriousness to every task, from pouring the French wines recommended by the sommelier to using an eye-dropper to add tabasco to the consomm\u00e9 de queue de boeuf wagyu. That\u2019s oxtail soup, to you and me. By the time we leave the table, the ship is starting to sway a little. In my bathroom, I watch my lipstick roll slowly back and forth on the shelf below the mirror. The Observation Lounge\u2019s plush suites make for a comfortable place to take in the views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDay Three 2.50am: Woken by the ship\u2019s movement. Strange creaking sound coming from somewhere. 7.20am: Press button to raise the blind. Bleak outside, and the sea is still churning. It\u2019s late spring, yet the daily information bulletin I call up on my TV screen says the temperature will peak at five degrees. 8.30am: Make my way to the main lounge, on Deck Four, occasionally putting a steadying hand on a wall. Lurch up to the help desk and ask the person on duty how he rates the present level of choppiness. \u201cIt is very smooth,\u201d he says in a firm, pleasant voice. 9.05am: Captain announces we are entering Milford Sound, and soon the conditions really are calm. Stretching 15 kilometres inland from the Tasman Sea, this is an extraordinarily beautiful place where steep-sided mountains loom over the water and thin waterfalls lace cobweb-like over cliff surfaces. The British writer Rudyard Kipling, who visited in the 1890s, called it the eighth wonder of the world. 10.15am: As we sail further into the Sound, a pod of dolphins appears on our port bow. One of those moments when you almost want to berate Nature for overplaying her hand. Too much! The writer following a trip on one of the ship\u2019s H130 helicopters. Credit: Rob Locke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10.45am: I take a ride on one of the ship\u2019s two black Airbus H130 helicopters. After lifting off from the helipad on Deck Eight, we buzz over inlets and hover beside precipices. In a picture taken by one of the other journalists, I look frozen with fear, but that\u2019s my exhilarated expression. 2pm: Cocktails on Deck Ten. The host is cruise director Chloe Barlow, a vivacious young Englishwoman who doubles as one of the ship\u2019s entertainers. \u201cI am totally in love with ABBA,\u201d she says, and breaks into Honey, Honey. Scenic Eclipse I and II sail the world from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica and almost everywhere in between. Europe, South and North America, Asia, the South Pacific and Australia are all on itineraries. A Scottish couple, farmers from the Borders district, tell me they\u2019ve been on several of the cruises and enjoyed them all, but Antarctica was the mind-blower. 2.50pm: Captain Sakkariassen announces that we\u2019re heading back out to the open ocean, and tonight can expect strong winds with swells of three to four metres. In my suite, I remember that all the drinks in the fridge are free. It hasn\u2019t been stocked with champagne, unfortunately, so I ring Francis, my designated butler, and ask if he could bring some. I\u2019m expecting a glass or a minibar-sized bottle. What arrives is a full-sized bottle of Chassenay D\u2019Arce Cuv\u00e9e Premi\u00e8re Brut. Oh well. Koko\u2019s, where guests can dine on sushi at an ocean-view benchtop. 4pm: Join a tour of the ship conducted by Chloe Barlow, who in defiance of the increasingly heavy weather is wearing high-heeled sandals. \u201cThis is the rockiest ship tour I\u2019ve ever taken,\u201d she says brightly as she teeters along a corridor. 9pm: The ship\u2019s chefs offer a variety of cuisines: Italian, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Indian and so on. At Koko\u2019s, the Asian restaurant, I have delicious Filipino dishes cooked on the teppanyaki grill. Retire to my suite, where I flick through the TV channels, watch the BBC for a bit, then toss back a couple of seasickness tablets I picked up from the help desk. Later discover you\u2019re supposed to take only one at a time. Day Four\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9am: Breakfast at the Yacht Club, the casual restaurant on Deck Seven. As I wait for my order \u2013 omelette with smoked salmon \u2013 I learn that, for some, it was a long and uncomfortable night. A woman from North Carolina, an experienced cruiser, tells me there was a point when she wondered whether she should put warm clothes over her pyjamas, in case we needed to abandon ship. I decide not to divulge that, thanks to the double dose of seasickness tablets, I had 10 hours\u2019 uninterrupted slumber. Honestly haven\u2019t felt this well-rested in years. Passengers can choose to visit the Golden Bay nature trail on Stewart Island. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo All is still now, because we\u2019re moored in the lee of Stewart Island, which lies some 30 kilometres off the bottom of New Zealand\u2019s South Island. Nothing much between here and Antarctica. Loading 12.15pm: A few of us clamber into a Zodiac bound for tiny Ulva Island, a wildlife sanctuary just off the coast of Stewart Island. We\u2019ve signed up for a two-hour walking tour. Ulva is home to several bird and plant species that on mainland New Zealand are rare or have died out. Our guide\u2019s enthusiasm is catching, and the pristine forest enchanting. By the time we return to the ship, my hands are so cold I can hardly hold my champagne glass. 5.15pm: Trivia quiz in the lounge. The journalists \u2013 we call our team The Freeloaders \u2013 win the event. Nearly toss a Missoni cushion into the air in celebration. Day Five\n\n\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Loading For a teenager who had not raced senior open races internationally before, he is a world figure already. He is the buzz athlete everyone wants to see, to witness if the talk is real. They now know it is. It\u2019s the speed, the age, the unusual name, and the unmistakable likeness to Usain Bolt\u2019s running style - to say nothing of having bettered some of the world\u2019s greatest sprinter\u2019s achievements at the same age - that make a likeness difficult to ignore and so made the world take notice. Even Gout and Bolt both see the similarity. The race itself on Wednesday (AEST) was mature. An odd word that for a 17-year-old who had to wait until year 12 school holidays to fly to Europe and race, but he ran a composed, mature race. Not overawed by the moment, he had a calm assurance of what he needed to do and if he did that, then he would probably win. He already knows his race. He knows his starts are a weakness but that he comes home strong so if he is within touch coming off the bend, he is confident he will win. It is what he expected in Ostrava and the race followed his plot.\n\nThe query was whether he was fit enough and strong enough against more seasoned runners. He had a blisteringly good summer, but how much fitter and stronger was he now after even a few months of training \u2013 while studying year 12? The answer was emphatically that he is fitter, stronger and quicker. \u201cI\u2019ve felt stronger in training these last couple of months and I\u2019ve felt good since I got to Europe last Thursday,\u201d Gout said. Gout Gout celebrates after winning the men 200 metres during the Ostrava Golden Spike athletics meet. Credit: AP \u201cI knew Mena [Cuban Reynier Mena] would come hard at me the first 100, but I was confident I\u2019d be close enough to come home strongly in the second part of the race, which is of course my stronger part.\u201d As the runners came out of the bend and the stagger evened out, Gout in lane six had moved ahead of the two runners wilting on his outside to only have Mena ahead of him on his inside lane. At the 100m, Mena eased open the gap on Gout slightly for about 10 metres, and it appeared he might hold Gout out.\n\nLoading But this was the mature bit: Gout looked more relaxed and confident than Mena. Gout knew he would come, but you got the sense Mena knew the same thing and tightened up as he tried to strain for the line. By 160m, Gout looked like he kicked up a gear but in fact he was just holding his top-end pace \u2013 a rare thing to be able to do late in a 200 \u2013 while Mena hit the sand and slowed down. By the time they hit the line, the gap was a metre and widening. Gout stopped the clock at 20.02s ahead of Mena in 20.19 and Briton Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake in 20.60. \u201cI felt calm but strong as I came off the turn and was confident I\u2019d be strong enough to get the win,\u201d Gout said. \u201cAnother national record! Pretty happy with that, it\u2019s not a bad first-up in Europe!\u201d The win was not only a first European victory but affirmation that Gout is untroubled mentally or physically by racing the marquee races of Europe against much older and more experienced runners.\n\nLoading He will now stay and train in Europe ahead of a race at the Monaco Diamond League in an under-23 200m race on July 11. That Gout made his European debut in Ostrava and ran a personal best created a further neat synergy with Bolt. Bolt held the 200m meet record of 19.83 in Ostrava that he set as a 21-year-old when Gout was barely six months old. That was in 2008 and later that year, Bolt went on to win his first Olympic gold medal. In Bolt\u2019s first race in Ostrava as a 19-year-old he ran 20.28. Of course, while these stats mean everything and nothing as the portents for Gout\u2019s future, they do provide perspective for how impressive Gout\u2019s performances are when measured against what the world\u2019s greatest had done.",

Credit: Eddie Jim\n\nThe club, which received $1.5 million in state and federal government funding to build the daycare centre 15 years ago, says it wants to vary the occupation arrangements so it can secure a longer-term lease for the centre. It had been sub-let to the non-profit childcare provider ECMS since 2009.\n\nKingsville mother Ayeesha Montalti said parents felt blindsided by the decision and she was worried about what the changes meant for the future of the centre, where her eldest son Ambrose has attended since 2023.",

Source: RACV/City of Yarra Council\n\nMillions of drivers in Australia are being reminded of a significant road rule change officially coming into effect from Tuesday, with penalties for breaking the law as high as $961.\n\nFrom July 1, Victorians are legally required to slow down to 40 kilometres an hour when they pass incident response vehicles that display lights of any colour. The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) is reminding the public of the change, first announced in April, which aims to make work much safer for the thousands of roadside assistance staff across the country.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News Australia, RACV General Manager Automotive Services, Makarla Cole, said around 17 per cent of RACV emergency roadside assistance callouts are to roads where the speed limit exceeds 100 km/h, making the introduction of this new law particularly timely.\n\n\"The change to road rule 79A is an important one to RACV because we\u2019ve campaigned for a long time to improve the safety of working conditions for our emergency roadside assistance patrols, as well as our RACV members, who are assisting on our roads,\" she said.\n\nThe new change is aimed at making work safer for the thousands of roadside assistance crews across the state. Source: StreetSmarts\n\nWhy is it important to slow down when passing roadside assistance?\n\nIn March 2024, RACV surveyed its emergency roadside assistance patrols to gauge how safe they feel while working on Victorian roads. \"RACV\u2019s patrols rated 'vehicles not slowing down' as the most common unsafe behaviour that they experience when working on the roads,\" Cole said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe said that 'no or insufficient emergency lanes' was another issue, highlighting the need to slow down in dangerous situations. \"100 per cent of respondents told RACV that they believe reducing the speed limit to 40 km/h when passing a roadside assistance vehicle would make their workplace safer,\" Cole said.\n\nSince 2017, Victorian drivers have been required to slow down to 40 km/h when passing stationary emergency vehicles displaying red or blue flashing lights.\n\nThat rule has now been expanded to include a broader range of roadside responders. Drivers must also slow down when approaching stationary accident towing vehicles, breakdown towing services, roadside assistance operators, and incident response vehicles operating on Peninsula Link, EastLink, and Transurban-managed roads.\n\nThe move follows South Australia, which adopted a similar law earlier this year. It's part of a sweeping set of road rule changes to be implemented across the country from July 1, as authorities look to tackle the rising number of deaths and injuries on our roads, which has been on a steady incline in recent years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRACV said emergency roadside assistance patrols help over 820,000 Victorians annually.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
