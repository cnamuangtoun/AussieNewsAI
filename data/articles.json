(AP)\n\nMusk messaged Epstein again ahead of a planned trip to the Caribbean in late December 2013. \"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,\" he wrote. \"Is there a good time to visit?\"\n\nEpstein responded by extending an invite for sometime after the New Year holiday.\n\n\"play it by ear if you want,\" he wrote. \"always space for you.\"\n\n\"I will come and get you,\" Epstein wrote in a follow up email.\n\nIt's not immediately clear if the island visits took place.\n\nNine.com.au is not suggesting that by appearing in any of the Epstein documents implies wrongdoing, only that names have appeared.\n\nSpokespersons for Musk's companies, Tesla and X, didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday. Musk has maintained that he repeatedly turned down the disgraced financier's overtures.\n\n\"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" he posted on X in 2025 when House Democrats released an Epstein calendar with an entry mentioning a potential Musk visit to the island.\n\nElon Musk and his then-partner Talulah Riley on 2014. (WireImage)\n\nEpstein supported Trump's first-term efforts to oust Fed chair\n\nIn a 2018 exchange, Epstein and Trump advisor Steve Bannon discussed the president's threats to oust Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he had named to the post just the year prior.\n\n\"should have been done months ago too old!!!!\" Epstein wrote.\n\n\"Can u get rid of Powell or really get rid of mnuchin,\" Bannon replied, referring to then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\n\"no, mnuchin is ok,\" Epstein replied.\n\nTrump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Powell after spending the past year assailing him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.\n\nJeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. (US Department of Justice)\n\nNew files related to Epstein's time in jail\ufeff\n\nSome documents are related to Epstein's incarceration and suicide.\n\nOthers centre around Ghislaine Maxwell's incarceration and her grievances related to her imprisonment conditions.\n\nThe records contain emails between investigators that discuss Epstein's death, including his last note \u2014 with the email stating that it does not appear to be a suicide note.\n\nThousands of pages of documents related to Epstein's jail suicide have already been released.\n\nREAD MORE: Bill and Hillary Clinton risk prison after vote by Epstein committee \ufeff\n\nCommerce Secretary appears to have visited Epstein's island\n\nOn one occasion in December 2012, Epstein invited Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to his private island in the Caribbean for lunch, according to documents released on Friday show. Lutnick's wife, Allison Lutnick, enthusiastically accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. On another occasion in 2011, the two men had drinks, according to a schedule shared with Epstein.\n\nLutnick has tried to distance himself from associations with Epstein, saying in a 2025 interview that he cut ties with the sex offender decades ago, calling him \"gross\".\n\nThe two men's lives continued to intersect as recently as 2018, documents show. That year, Epstein contributed to a philanthropic dinner honoring Lutnick, according to email exchanges. The year prior, the two men sent each other emails about the construction of a building across the street from both of their homes.\n\nLutnick didn't respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday afternoon.\n\nA \"No Trespassing\" sign on Esptein's island. (via CNN)\n\nDemocrats decry limited release\ufeff\n\n\"The DOJ said it identified over six million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions. This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill that mandated the disclosure.\n\nKhanna said he was looking to see whether the files released Friday included FBI interviews with victims, a draft indictment and information prosecutors collected during a 2007 investigation into Epstein in Florida.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has also issued a separate subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the files without redactions, but that has not been fulfilled.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, called the limited release of documents \"outrageous and incredibly concerning.\"\n\nOver the years, prosecutors received tips from people with wild stories about being sexually abused by famous figures.\n\nIn some instances, FBI investigators diligently reached out to these tipsters and alleged victims and listened to their implausible sounding stories \u2014 some involving the occult and human sacrifice \u2014 then wrote dry reports summarising what the people had to say and sent them to their superiors.",

(Supplied)\n\nBut if Becsi wants to take the issue to the Parliament of Victoria - which is her hope - she'll need to create an official paper petition or digital e-Petition.\n\nA paper petition needs more than 2000 signatures to trigger a debate in Parliament; an e-petition (alone or alongside a paper petition) needs 10,000.\n\nAnd none of the Change.org signatures will carry over.",

        "text": "Tesla dominated the electric vehicle industry by the mid-2010s with sleek, fast cars that helped combat the public perception that EVs were severely limited by short ranges.\n\nNow the company, and its controversial Chief Executive, Elon Musk , face stiffer competition and political headwinds.\n\nIts EV sales fell by a record 9 per cent in 2025, amid increasing rivalry from China and the expiration of the US EV sales tax credit.\n\nIn November last year, Elon Musk offered a sneak peak of Tesla's Optimus robot. (Tesla Australia)\n\nBut Musk has been steering the company toward an audacious bet.\n\nHe believes Tesla's future won't ride on cars but on humanoid robots.\n\nOn Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, Musk laid out a literal replacement of Tesla cars by robots \u2013 announcing Tesla would discontinue the Model S and Model X in favour of making more of its Optimus robots.\n\n\"We're gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal of having one million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,\" he said.\n\nIt is the quintessential science-fiction dream of the future: Musk says Tesla's Optimus robots will do everything from cleaning your house to performing surgery.\n\nHe's called Optimus, the key to eliminating world poverty, making human work optional and reaching Mars .\n\nAnd he claims they'll be on sale by the end of 2027.\n\n\"Every human on earth is going to have their own personal R2-D2, C3PO,\" Musk said in November, referring to the personal robots from Star Wars .\n\n\"But actually, Optimus will be better than that.\"\n\nBut critics say these are fever-dream distractions from Tesla's core automotive business.\n\nAnd plenty of companies, like Boston Dynamics and Figure, are already deep into the humanoid robot business.\n\nMusk's own success and pay are directly at stake.\n\nTesla must deliver one million Optimus robots within 10 years for Musk to fully realise an almost $US1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) Tesla pay plan approved by shareholders late last year.\n\n\"Elon is a big thinker, and he wants to be pushing the edge of people's imagination,\" a former Tesla senior engineer told CNN in an interview.\n\nBut the EV and robot markets are very different, the engineer said.\n\n\"With electric vehicles, Tesla was really the only one working on this hard problem. There's a lot of companies now and tons of competition.\"\n\nMusk laid out a literal replacement of Tesla cars by robots. (Supplied)\n\n'Infinite money glitch'\n\nTesla first unveiled its humanoid robot project at a 2021 event, where a silvery figure danced to thumping techno music on a stage.\n\nIt was an actor in a robot suit, complete with a face that looked like a screen. \"Obviously, that's not real,\" Musk said as the costumed figure left the stage.\n\nJust months later, in January 2022, Musk said he thought Optimus could be \"more significant than the vehicle business\" for Tesla over time.\n\nTesla says Optimus can now sort objects, serve popcorn, throw out trash and dance.\n\nIt does \"some basic tasks in the factory,\" Musk said Wednesday, progress, but still a far cry from Musk's futuristic vision, even as he predicted Optimus could eventually generate $US10 trillion ($14 trillion) of revenue.\n\nYet Musk has set a speedy timeline for Optimus.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum this month, he said the robot will be available for sale by the end of 2027.\n\nIt is a lofty goal, one experts say may be tougher than Musk's bets on electric vehicles or SpaceX.\n\nREAD MORE: Melbourne nail salon firebombed twice in two days\n\nMusk has set a speedy timeline for Optimus. (AP)\n\nHumanoid robots are among the most complex machines imaginable, and the race to build them is already heating up.\n\nTesla is not the only company in this space.\n\nHyundai and Google DeepMind are also deploying their Atlas humanoid robot internally in the coming months before rolling it out to customers.\n\nMeanwhile, the CES tech show in January was full of companies, including Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel, showing off humanoid robots powered by their chips and technologies.\n\nMore than 90 companies have a humanoid robot product, according to Ani Kelkar, a partner at McKinsey & Company who leads the firm's advanced automation and autonomy sector. More are coming, especially in the United States and China.\n\nExperts from McKinsey, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley estimate the humanoid robot market could eventually be worth anywhere from $US370 billion ($524 billion) by 2040 to $US5 trillion ($7 trillion) by 2050.\n\nTesla does have critical advantages in its expertise in motors, batteries and mechanisms, said Ken Goldberg, a professor who supervises research in robotics and automation at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"They also understand how to make something advanced in high volume \u2013 with cost effectiveness, and that's really important,\" Goldberg said.\n\nREAD MORE: Man kept alive for 48 hours with lungs removed\n\nMusk's commentary and support of US President Donald Trump have made him a polarising figure. (AP)\n\nThe company could also benefit from using Optimus internally and selling it externally, giving it a \"cost advantage\" that could enable Tesla to make \"several thousand dollars per robot,\" Goldman Sachs said in an October report.\n\nBut most experts agree it'll be at least a decade before humanoid robots are widely deployed.\n\n\"A giant leap may happen, but we don't know when,\" Goldberg said.\n\n\"Most technology develops as a slow burn over time, so I think the expectations about having fully general humanoids seems over-inflated.\"\n\nOthers are sceptical about whether humanoid robots will ever be broadly useful in society.\n\nBill Ray, an analyst following emerging technologies and robotics for market research firm Gartner, previously told CNN that humanoid robots face too many limitations to be practical.\n\nOptimus challenges\n\nMusk has swung big with timelines before \u2013 and missed. He previously said Tesla cars would be fully autonomous by 2018, and that SpaceX would start sending rockets to Mars by 2018 \u2013 neither of which has happened yet.\n\nAnd already with Optimus, Tesla has missed its leader's ambitious schedule. Musk had initially set internal goals for Tesla to produce at least 5000 Optimus units in 2025, according to The Information .\n\nThat goal was slashed to 2000 a few months later and has been lowered again since, The Information reported in October.\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nMusk has acknowledged that his goals are not easy.\n\n\"Right now, we're struggling with the final design of the hardware,\" especially of the arm and hand, Musk said at the All In Summit in September.\n\n\"Human-like hands are notoriously hard for robots to emulate. Unlike people, robots have a hard time knowing how to grip different objects like a wet glass versus a piece of metal.\n\n\"People think of space travel as extraordinarily difficult, and it is, no doubt, but it turns out that getting a robot to reliably tie a sneaker is harder than getting a rocket out of the atmosphere,\" Goldberg said.\n\nMusk's political commentary and support of US President Donald Trump have also made him a polarising figure, resulting in protests and vandalism at Tesla dealerships across the country.\n\nProtests and vandalism occured at Tesla dealerships across the country. (Getty)\n\nA man uses chalk to write messages on the side of a San Francisco Tesla store during a protest. (AP Photo/Noah Berger)\n\n\"If they won't buy his cars, why would they buy a huge robot for their home from him?\" posted Ross Gerber, an early Tesla investor and CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, who is now a prominent critic of Musk.\n\nMusk acknowledged the \"many who doubt our ambitions for creating amazing abundance\" on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\n\"But we're confident it can be done, and that we're making the right moves technologically to ensure that it does.\"\n\n\"And Tesla's obviously never been a company to shy away from solving some of the hardest problems,\" he added.\n\nBut Musk's version of the future won't happen instantly \u2013 and maybe not for a long time.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary, but he promises things that sometimes may take more time than his engineers can deliver,\" said Goldberg.\n\n\"The research community all over the world is working very hard on this, but it's not going to get solved overnight.\"",

In large parts of Australia, accessing a spot at before and after-school care is not an option for many parents.\n\nThe six centres will be delivered under a joint funding agreement, including $25.5 million from the federal government's Building Early Education Fund, alongside a $5 million contribution and land from the Tasmanian government.\n\nIn a joint statement, Tasmanian Minister for Education Jo Palmer said: \"We know that quality early learning gives children the best possible start in life and the Tasmanian Government is delivering for our youngest learners on this lifelong journey.\n\n\"This joint investment is an exciting opportunity for these regions which we know are lacking access to ECEC services.\n\n\" We are proud to be partnering with the Commonwealth to deliver for Tasmanian families. \"\n\nFederal Minister for Education Jason Clare said: \"The Building Early Education Fund will help deliver more quality early education places for families in communities that need them most.\n\n\"Where you grow up shouldn't determine whether you can access early education.\n\n\" These projects in Tasmania mean more families can access early learning close to home and more children start school ready to go and ready to learn. \"\n\n'It's been a long time coming'\n\nTeisha Archer's youngest children will be too old to benefit from the centre by the time it opens.

(ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nFor persimmon and avocado grower Craig Burne in South Australia's Riverland, netting infrastructure across his persimmon crop has been a lifeline.\n\n\"We have overhead misting systems that come on at 35 degrees to help cool the avocado orchard ... and we have our nets for the persimmons,\" he said.\n\n\"Without these two systems in place, I don't think we'd successfully grow either of these crops in this climate anymore.\n\nCraig Burne says it will take days until he knows the full extent of his avocado crop loss.

(ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\n\"Without those net structures protecting fruit from that sun and those extreme heat events, you're not going to get through without crop loss, it's as simple as that,\" he said.\n\nNetting the way of the future?\n\nG2 Netting Group sales director Kyle Lamont said netting sales across Australia had increased in recent years, especially in regions including the Riverland, Sunraysia and Goulburn Valley.\n\n\"Over the last five to 10 years, there's definitely been an uptake and an increase in growers looking for protection,\" he said.\n\nKyle Lamont says some netting structures can reduce UV exposure by up to 20 per cent. (Supplied: Kyle Lamont)\n\n\"There's really no growing regions that aren't increasing netting structures.\n\n\"[Growers] can maintain a more stable environment under the netting structures, and during the peak of those heatwaves, it's probably 2 or 3 degrees cooler under those structures.\"\n\nMr Lamont said export markets in countries such as China, Korea and Japan were only accepting \"pristine\" fruit, highlighting the need for sun protection.\n\n\"People buy with their eyes, so unfortunately, that means [growers] have to produce blemish-free fruit, and that's getting harder with these extreme challenges from Mother Nature,\" he said.\n\nMr Lamont said some netting structures could cost about $60,000 per hectare to install.\n\nNetting infrastructure usually has a lifespan of around 15 years. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nMr Lamont said while he believed there was still a place for small fruit producers who were unable to afford netting, it was a no-brainer for corporate growers to install the infrastructure.\n\n\"Netting is an insurance policy, and I believe most large-scale or major growers will be going that way,\" he said.\n\nSouth Australia's Department of Primary Industries and Regions previously offered grants of up to 50 per cent on netting infrastructure installation or repairs for Riverland and Adelaide Hills growers.\n\nThe funding stream ended on June 30, 2025.\n\nHotter days and longer heatwaves\n\nAdelaide University environmental health researcher Peng Bi said heatwaves would continue to be an issue across the country.\n\n\"We are seeing the increase of heatwaves across Australia.

(ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nBack in the state's Riverland, Mr Burne said consolidating his crop varieties may be the way forward.\n\n\"The question will be, do we start consolidating our business in terms of moving away some of the avocado orchards that aren't as productive ... and replant to persimmons to remain under net?\" he said.\n\n\"In an ideal situation, I'd have my whole farm under net, but avocados are just too damn big to grow under nets.\"",

        "text": "A dozen performers donning angelic white and crimson outfits dance along a runway to thunderous applause from the crowd and chants of \"Hey hey what's up, Furia f*** it up!\"\n\nThis is not a conventional Saturday night for the State Library Victoria.\n\nNormally a space of quiet reading, the 172-year-old institution was transformed into the Fantasy Ball, a queer pageant-like event where attendees from across the country come to watch participants \"walk\" in eight categories.\n\nLoading...\n\nBallroom is a burgeoning subculture with roots in late 20th-century Harlem, New York, created to foster community and safety for LGBTQIA+ people of colour, particularly trans women.\n\nThe subject of the 1990 documentary Paris is Burning and the hit drama series Pose, ballroom has since found its way to Australian cities.\n\nFounding mother of the House of Furia, Angel, says the Fantasy Ball is about allowing queer people to live out their dreams. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\nFantasy Ball curator Angel Furia says ballroom provided a space for queer people living on the margins to experience their fantasy.\n\n\"In ballroom, the fantasy of walking a category is usually walking a category that does not exist in your everyday life,\" Angel says.\n\n\" The fantasy is creating that visual representation of yourself. It's almost like manifesting for yourself who you can be. \"\n\n'Vogue fem'\n\nIn the beginners' performance category, participants dressed as fairies fly down the runway performing \"vogue fem\", a high-energy dance characterised by fluid, feminine movement.\n\nVogue fem is a dance style integral to ballroom, with five elements including duck walks and dips. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\nCompetitors weave their arms in flamboyant patterns, and synchronise their dips to drops in the backing music, while a quick-witted commentator stirs up the crowd.\n\nSolana Iman was living \"every fantasy\" after winning the beginner's performance category. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\nAfter a few rounds of eliminations, a battle ensues between the final two fairies, with Solana Iman declared the victor.\n\n\"For me, voguing is an expression, it's a feeling, it's not just a dance move. It's a struggle that queer POC [people of colour] have to go through,\" she tells the ABC.\n\nTakudzwa 007 vogues the house down in the beginners' performance category. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\nRunner-up Takudzwa 007 says voguing is the \"main attraction\" of ballroom for him.\n\n\"A lot of it has an element to it that expresses the feminine in such a raw way for me,\" he says.\n\n\"It just feels like that side of my queer identity can be fully out there.\"\n\nChosen family\n\nWithin ballroom, participants compete as individuals, known as 007s, or as a member of a collective, known as a house.\n\nThe house often serves as a \"chosen family\", a support system for community members who may struggle to connect with their biological family.\n\nExperienced members nurture younger talent.\n\nBallroom houses give queer people a chosen family, with house mothers nurturing their children. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\n\"Chosen family is really important for me because they've been there for me during my ups and downs,\" Solana says.\n\n\"I grew up in a conservative Muslim black family household, so they're not really accepting.\"\n\n\" When I found ballroom, that's when I found family and who I was as a person. \"\n\nHouse of Furia opens the ball with a grand march, showcasing sharp dance skills and impeccable fashion. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\nThe category is \u2026\n\nThe categories demand an intimate knowledge of ballroom, sharp performance skills, and the right dose of artistic flair.\n\nPerformers are judged by a panel of seasoned judges, with the goal of achieving a perfect score or \"10s across the board\".\n\nThe Bizarre x Best Dressed category calls for an effect inspired by a deity from your ancestry. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\nJudge Chantal 007 Revlon says she looks for performers who are \"fearless\".\n\n\"I'm looking for you to be audacious, and I'm looking for you to tell me your story,\" she says.\n\nChantal 007 Revlon sits on the judging panel and says ballroom is a safe space, and a brave space. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\n\"I want you to be able to bring me into your world, like this is your world and I'm just living in it.\n\nLGBTQI+ community support services ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends.\n\n\"Ballroom is sometimes a safe space, but it's mostly a brave space, and it's a space where you are required to be fearless and believe in yourself.\"\n\nBut if you fail to meet the requirements of the category, you face being chopped.\n\nFor the femme queens\n\nThroughout the evening, commentators remind the audience that the event is about celebrating \"femme queens\", ballroom terminology for trans women.\n\nLilo 007 puts on a fierce showing in the Victoria's Secret inspired European Runway category. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\n\"A femme queen is a woman who owns her power no matter what,\" Heidi Furia said.\n\nOnce an online streamer, Heidi was encouraged by one of her viewers to explore the ballroom scene.\n\nEventually, it led her to being welcomed into a community of trans women.\n\nWinner, winner: Mother Leah Iman's house triumphs in four categories. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\n\"I met those women for the first time in my life, but it really felt like I knew them for so many years,\" she says.\n\n\" It felt really nice to be around people who are just like me. \"\n\nStepping onto the stage with her house, Heidi says she is living her dream.\n\n\"Ballroom is so important because in this climate, this is where our queer youth need to be celebrated, understood, accepted and lifted up,\" Heidi said.\n\nCyrus Iman takes Kylie Minogue 'Padam Padam' red to new heights in the European Runway category. (ABC News: Jacob Gamble)\n\n\"We need to be able to feel like we can conquer this world just as much as anyone else.\"",

        "text": "Aryna Sabalenka will bid for a third Australian Open trophy in four years when the Belarusian collides with fellow power-hitter Elena Rybakina in a heavyweight rematch of their title showdown three years ago.\n\nThe dynamics have shifted since Sabalenka's breakthrough win in 2023, the 27-year-old now the clear favourite following three more Grand Slam triumphs and Rybakina yet to win another major after her 2022 Wimbledon success.\n\nDjokovic hits out at critics Novak Djokovic sets his sights on those who doubted whether he could still be an Australian Open contender.\n\nThe pair know each other well, having met 14 times on tour, with Sabalenka holding a narrow edge in a rivalry marked by bruising baseline battles and momentum swings.\n\nBut the top seed said history would count for little on Rod Laver Arena.\n\n\"We both are different players,\" Sabalenka said.\n\n\"We went through different things and we're much stronger mental and physically. We're playing better tennis now. So I'll approach this as completely different match.\n\n\"We have long history after that final. I'll approach this match as the very first one and I will do my very best.\"\n\nVictory would give Sabalenka her fifth Grand Slam title, drawing her level with Martina Hingis and Maria Sharapova and cementing her place among the most successful players of the modern era.\n\nAryna Sabalenka can make it three Australian Open titles in four years. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nRussian-born Kazakh Rybakina holds the recent bragging rights, having defeated Sabalenka in the WTA Finals title match at the end of 2025.\n\nThe fifth seed said she was banking on that experience to get her over the line at Melbourne Park.\n\n\"Of course, many years have passed and a lot of matches have been played,\" Rybakina said.\n\n\"Hopefully all the experience I got from the last match, and the last final that I played here, I can bring it to Saturday's match and do my best.\n\n\"Since we're both very aggressive players the serve will be important. I'll fight till the end, and hopefully this time it's going to go my way.\"\n\nBut the 2023 AO final between the pair, in which Sabalenka fought back from a set down to claim the first of her four major crowns so far, stands out.\n\n\"It was very close. Throughout the match, of course, I had some little opportunities but in the end of this third set I think Aryna stepped in,\" Rybakina said.\n\n\"She served much better. Yeah, she deserved that win.\"\n\nElena Rybakina is hoping to win her second grand slam title. (Getty Images: Fred Lee)\n\nMelbourne has been especially kind to Sabalenka.\n\nShe has won 26 of her last 27 matches at the year's first Grand Slam with her only defeat coming against Madison Keys in the 2025 final, which denied her a Melbourne Park \"three-peat\".\n\nAustralian Open day 13 quick hits Gadecki and Peers make their own bit of history and \"old man\" Djokovic turns back the clock to reach his 11th Aussie final. Here are the quick hits from day 13 at the Australian Open.\n\nSabalenka's game is tailor-made for the fast, blue hardcourts which have rewarded her heavy first serve and flat groundstrokes, and she has not dropped a set en route to the final this year.\n\nRybakina has been just as efficient, marking the first time that both Australian Open women's finalists have reached the decider without surrendering a set since Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters in 2004.\n\nWhile Sabalenka breezed past Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3 in the semi-finals, Rybakina had to battle against Jessica Pegula to earn a 6-3, 7-6(9/7) win and keep her record intact.\n\nThe 2022 All England Club champion has been in blistering form since the latter stages of last year, piecing together 13 wins from her last 14 matches and sustaining a level of consistency that has made her a threat.\n\nWires",

        "text": "A mere 2,000 years after the disciple Luke taught us about the Prodigal Son, social media has finally discovered the concept of \"going no contact\" with your parents.\n\nUnusually, Oprah got there a little later than everybody else who had already been mass-posting about quitting toxic relatives, when she broadcast a blockbuster YouTube show featuring abandoned parents and rejecting children over this \"new\" trend \u2014 she called it \u2014 of cutting parents out of your lives.\n\nA short time afterwards, Brooklyn \u2014 the first-born son of interstellar celebrities, Victoria and David Beckham \u2014 also got the memo and very publicly sacked his parents. The world has been in a kind of ecstatic, voyeuristic, schadenfreudic freefall ever since.\n\nOprah Winfrey broadcast a blockbuster YouTube show featuring abandoned parents and rejecting children. (AP: Paul Drinkwater)\n\nAn age-old sorrow\n\nBack home, just a scant two years ago, high-flying PWC chief and Carlton Football Club president, Luke Sayers, was jetting to the walled Renaissance town of Lucca in Tuscany for the 50th birthday celebrations of his wife, Cate, along with enough of their close personal friends to book out almost the entire town.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThe roiling PWC tax leaks scandal was blowing up behind him as he left, and yet Sayers's magical life of expensive, luxurious celebrations appeared untouched.\n\nFast-forward to today and the couple are now estranged, and engaged in a defamation action involving a lewd picture, with their daughters publicly taking the side of their father against their mother.\n\nHappy families, unhappy families \u2014 Tolstoy told you years ago how this goes. But most of that sad and sorry stuff of parents who can't connect with kids, and kids who can't trust their parents goes on in quiet desperation behind walls we never get to see through.\n\nSo, when this age-old sorrow explodes in public, it's almost reassuring, a kind of sick-making corrective when the rich and beautiful and blessed and entitled and seemingly perfect are also revealed to have car-crash lives, just like the rest of us.\n\nThere is little mystery to family breakdown. The complexity of making those intertwined, sometimes traumatised, sometimes poorly managed connections work is so dense, it is a wonder so many of these units thrive at all.\n\nEstrangement not a new concept\n\nA lot of us can reproduce. That biological ability is absolutely no predictor of us being able to parent. Home and family have never been safe for many many people. Walking away has a long history, as Brooklyn Beckham's similarly estranged close friends, the Sussexes, have found.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.\n\nBut it is a continuing mystery when the seemingly perfect family chooses to implode so publicly, briefs so many other conduits of their drama, and seeks so many witnesses to their pain. The final taboo \u2014 Shakespeare's serpent-toothed, ungrateful child \u2014 will always be shocking. The spectacle is an enduringly irresistible one, but after a short period of ogling it, one feels compelled to look away.\n\nSo, it's clear that while recent social media may have given it a hashtag, the phenomenon of cutting off parents perceived as unkind or damaging is as old as the concept of family itself. As Oprah found, we have many new terms for an age-old disaffection. You can lose yourself in the social-media miasma of \"recognising toxic parents\" or \"setting boundaries\".\n\nBrooklyn Beckham recently announced he was cutting ties with his parents. (Reuters: Aude Guerrucci/File Photo)\n\nCuriously, the therapist on Oprah's podcast who leaned towards the importance of reconciliation wanted to suggest that the more people heard such terms the more they might be led to cutting parents out of their lives (intriguingly, his daughter had done that to him for several years).\n\nBut after decades of interviewing people on my radio shows from any and all backgrounds but with complex family histories, it was always mind-blowing to me how children are wired to love and forgive their parents to an extraordinary degree.\n\nDavid Beckham breaks silence after son Brooklyn cuts ties The soccer superstar tells broadcasters at the World Economic Forum that \"children are allowed to make mistakes\" in his first public comments since his son's allegations went public.\n\nI spoke to adult kids of people who faced problems with gambling or drug and alcohol use, absconders, fathers who were barely there, mothers who were barely coping, and despite the sadness and the trauma they were sharing, they almost all concluded with how much they loved their parents. I heard it again and again. \"I know that despite all that (insert horror here) she really loved me and I loved her.\"\n\nThe connection and the empathy and the need to make that primary relationship work and thrive is hard-wired into children. It takes so much to break it \u2014 so much more than many well-meaning therapists realise, I think.\n\nIt's a classic iceberg dilemma: you will only ever see the very top.\n\nHistories with long tails\n\nIn a case like the Beckhams, we will get to see the seemingly minor absolute last straw \u2014 an apparently inappropriate mother-son dance at a wedding \u2014 but not what one of Oprah's guests called \"the one thousand little things\" that finally led to the decision to walk. Those histories have very long tails.\n\nThere is perhaps one very contemporary lesson in these age-old family sorrows, and that is the dangerous game of commodifying children and so perfectly packaging a family on social media and its possible consequences.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham cut ties with his parents. Here's how it went down Celebrity family rifts are not new. Experts weigh in on how they can spark negative feelings about our own family dynamics.\n\nPerhaps when such families, particularly the Beckhams, have built a literal brand (they trademarked their kids' names at birth) out of an image of family perfection, the rot sets in early for children who eventually chafe against it. It's a risky strategy when kids will always grow up, develop their own point of view and start to do the most ordinary but always confounding thing to their parents: they look at us and they judge us.\n\nThis weekend there is really only one thing I want to read about and understand \u2014 and only Julia Baird can help me: why are all these sharks attacking us?\n\nHave a safe and happy weekend and let's start our year of sounds with a beautiful, yearning tune from London-born Arlo Parks, who wrote this song as an ode to the beautiful oblivion found of the dancefloor, somewhere we'll need to find ourselves a lot more this year. I feel. Nice to see you all again. Go well.\n\nVirginia Trioli is presenter of Creative Types and a former co-host of ABC News Breakfast and Mornings on ABC Radio Melbourne.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nCABARET\n\nAmplified\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, January 30\n\nUntil February 8\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Long after Chrissy Amphlett\u2019s band Divinyls ground to a halt, she imagined doing a one-woman theatrical show about herself and her songs. Having spent her Divinyls career playing a fiery, racy, pouting, unpredictable schoolgirl, she wanted a character this time, too, reportedly settling on a crow. It was never to be. She died of breast cancer before the half-formed dream took flight. Enter Sheridan Harbridge, Glenn Moorhouse and Sarah Goodes. Together, they envisaged a ghost of the show Amphlett had contemplated, subtitling it The Exquisite Rock and Rage of Chrissy Amphlett. Harbridge wrote it, with Moorhouse as musical director and Goodes directing Harbridge\u2019s performance. They\u2019ve done a storming job. Sheridan Harbridge as Chrissy Amphlett in a potent performance. Jade Ellis Harbridge doesn\u2019t become Chrissy, in the sense that the story is told in the third person, but Amphlett\u2019s spirit is alive and living dangerously inside Harbridge\u2019s performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a range the latter has, from being the best Blanche I\u2019ve seen in A Streetcar Named Desire, to now exploding off the stage with a singing voice I didn\u2019t know she had, that could be brutally powerful when required, yet also sweetly soulful. Harbridge\u2019s voice can be brutally powerful but also sweetly soulful. Jade Ellis Beyond the potency of her performance and the engaging storytelling, the music and spoken word are interwoven so that a Divinyls hit might start, shudder to a stop while Harbridge tells us more, pick up again, and repeat this process. It\u2019s done so well that you\u2019re not cursing the fact that they won\u2019t get on with the song; you\u2019re engrossed in an ever-growing tension that finally finds release when the song takes centre-stage. Sheridan Harbridge in full flight. Jade Ellis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother strength is the music itself, with Moorhouse (on guitar) joined by Clarabell Limonta (keyboard), Ben Cripps (bass) and Dave Hatch (drums). I never particularly rated Divinyls as a band, compared with their songs and Amphlett\u2019s performance of them. Moorhouse and company have knocked some bricks out of the wall of sound and replaced them with nuance, without losing the kick to the surging chorus of, say, Boys in Town. Related Article What\u2019s on Chrissy Amphlett wrote a show in which she was a crow. Years after her death, her vision lives on The fearless Harbridge, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t just enter the audience, she invades it. She\u2019s also funny, and the humour makes for a completeness of emotional impact, given the inherent sadness of a story of excess, of Amphlett\u2019s repeatedly having to smash the same glass ceiling, and then suffering multiple sclerosis before the cancer hit. Perhaps it\u2019s also so moving because the show exudes such immense affection for its subject. If the intensity of grip is released a little in the final phase, it\u2019s certainly reasserted when they launch into I Touch Myself, the song that made the teenage Harbridge a fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspect Amphlett would approve. She\u2019d have appreciated the absence of hagiography and sugar-coating, and she may have recognised a fellow traveller in the high-stakes game of being audacious on stage. She may have even stood up with the rest of us at the end. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.",

Veteran chef Celal Per cutting slices of meat off a yaprak (leaf) doner. Matt O'Donohue Restaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox. Sign up A theory: maybe dad is a regular at the original Antep Mangal that Welat Yilmaz and Hasan Siringul opened six years ago on Beaufort Street to address the shish kebab, gozleme, pide and meat box deficiencies that the area was facing? So when news broke that Antep Mangal was expanding south, it\u2019s a given that venue number two would offer the same menu, right? Wrong. Instead, Yilmaz and Siringul want you to consider getting your doner hit via more traditional formats. As an Iskender, perhaps: a saucy arrangement of meat, tomato sauce and melted butter, piled on flatbread and presented alongside a cooling snowdrift of tangy yoghurt. Turkey has strong historical ties to Central Asia, hence the prevalence of dairy in its cuisine. (See the house-made ayran, a mildly salted drinking yoghurt.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe you could try the doner plate that invites buttery rice, unusually verdant salad plus fluffy bulgur (cracked wheat) simmered in the Turkish capsicum paste biber salcasi to the party. It\u2019s an option that doesn\u2019t just help you tick off your five serves of veg for the day: it also showcases the chew and eating quality of the meat itself. Look carefully at the hunk of flesh slowly gyrating on the vertical spit in the open kitchen, and you\u2019ll spy countless strata lines throughout. This is no garden-variety doner, but a yaprak or \u201cleaf\u201d doner: its name a reference to the layers \u2013 or leaves \u2013 of lamb and beef that veteran chef Celal Per uses to build each towering mille-feuille of meat. Per is also on cutting duties and shaves slices off the doner in both long strips and short patches to create different mouthfeels and textures. The kicker? The yaprak is exclusive to Antep Mangal\u2019s new Vic Park spin-off.

Crucially, the mangal \u2013 the Turkish word for \u201cgrill\u201d \u2013 smoulders all day, meaning char-grilled meat is available from just before lunch to early supper and any time in between. (Many grill places, perhaps understandably, only light their charcoal at night and during peak periods.) True, you\u2019ll wait longer for your shish here than some places, but the juiciness and controlled char of finished dishes suggests that your patience isn\u2019t going unrewarded.

No questions about sauces. No egg upsell. No double-meat option. These are minimalist kebabs that have been deliberately designed to not just highlight the quality of the meat, but also to quietly reinforce the restaurant\u2019s less-is-more mantra. Vic Park\u2019s menu might not cover as much ground as Mount Lawley\u2019s, but it takes diners closer to Turkey. That kebab bread, by the by, is one of many items made in-house. There\u2019s also an assortment of boat-shaped pide that are either baked open-faced or sealed like a pastie depending on its filling. They\u2019re good eating, but my picks among the baked goods are the lahmacun (thin flatbreads of impressive finesse topped with minced lamb and beef) and the excellent baklava, dense with walnuts and crowned with tanned, ruffled edges of crunchy yufka pastry. Related Article Good Food hat 15 / 20 Review This fine dining destination in the Perth Hills embodies the spirit (and flavours) of Australia Yet for all the understated detail in its cooking, Antep Mangal looks a lot like your average neighbourhood kebab joint. Diners order at a long counter. (The layout of the room occasionally causes bottlenecks if there\u2019s a queue and staff need to deliver food to dine-in guests.) Extraction fans work valiantly to yank out all that smoke but aren\u2019t quite strong enough. The fridge is filled with multinational soft drinks. But don\u2019t be fooled. Beneath this unassuming exterior is a shop cooking and serving some quietly impressive Turkish food. I dig it. A lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I also dig Turkish cuisine\u2019s wilder, less-classical moments too, not least the restorative power of a saucy, two-handed kebab at the end of a night out. (But please don\u2019t bring alcohol to Antep Mangal, it\u2019s a halal restaurant.) Some might suggest that makes me a bogan. I prefer the term open-minded. This town, I think, is big enough for both styles of Turkish food. For anyone keen to think and eat outside the (meat) box, Vic Park awaits. The low-down Atmosphere: a promising second act gently expanding the public\u2019s perception of Turkish food. Go-to dishes: adana shish kebab ($20), Yaprak doner plate ($27), lahmahcun ($10). Drinks: the Turkish salted drinking yoghurt ayran supplemented with a fridge full of multinational soft drinks (no BYO). Cost: about $65 for two people, excluding drinks.

Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, also claimed the Microsoft founder asked for antibiotics he could \u201csurreptitiously give\u201d to his then-wife Melinda, from whom he is now divorced. Bill Gates\u2019s spokesperson denied the claim as \u201cabsolutely absurd and completely false\u201d. AP In a separate email, Epstein told Peter Mandelson he had \u201cmonstrous fun\u201d with Gates in Seattle. Three million pages of documents released by the Trump administration also contain new photographs of Epstein with Gates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe files also reveal that Epstein offered Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor dinner with a 26-year-old Russian girl, as well as a claim that Epstein gave Lord Mandelson\u2019s husband \u00a310,000 for an osteopathy course. Related Article Epstein fallout US Justice Department releases millions of pages of Epstein documents Seven years after his death, Epstein continues to cast a long shadow over those who were in his orbit \u2013 and Gates, once the world\u2019s richest man, is among them. On July 18, 2013, Epstein sent a memo to himself including a number of allegations about Gates. It said: \u201cTo add insult to the injury you them [sic] implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your penis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein sent himself another email at 1.03 the same morning, announcing a resignation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Epstein never worked for the foundation, so it is believed he was writing the email in someone else\u2019s voice. Gates was given an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2005, in recognition of his services to charity. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire but is not known as \u201cSir\u201d, a title reserved only for British citizens. It is likely there will now be calls for the honour to be revoked, though Whitehall sources would not be drawn on whether No.10 would back such a move. A spokesman for Gates said: \u201cThese claims are absolutely absurd and completely false. \u201cThe only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein\u2019s frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates, and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFresh questions for Mandelson Other files raise fresh questions about the relationship between Epstein and Lord Mandelson, who was sacked as the British ambassador to Washington last year over previous revelations about his links to a man he called his \u201cbest pal\u201d. Lord Mandelson referred to Epstein as \u201ca good friend and totally trustworthy\u201d in another newly released message. In a separate July 2011 email, Lord Mandelson asked Epstein, \u201cwhat u doing?\u201d Epstein replied: \u201cSpent the day with Gates, in Seattle. Having monstrous fun.\u201d Documents that were included in the previous batch of files. AP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Mountbatten-Windsor will face fresh scrutiny over his own relationship with the convicted sex abuser, whose friendship led to him being stripped of his titles last year. The files show that Epstein introduced him to a 26-year-old Russian woman in 2010, after his conviction for soliciting prostitution. In emails to a contact listed as \u201cThe Duke\u201d, Epstein wrote: \u201cI have a friend who i think you might enjoy having dinner with, her name is irina she will be london 20-24 [sic].\u201d In response, the former Duke of York appeared to reply: \u201cOf course. I am in Geneva until the morning of 22nd but would be delighted to see her. Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.\u201d It was signed \u201cHRH The Duke of York KG\u201d. Epstein later clarified the woman was \u201c26, Russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther emails between Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for child trafficking, were also published on Friday. Related Article Royal family Prince Andrew photo no fake, says photographer who sourced it in 2011 The disgraced British socialite sent an email to an address linked to Mountbatten-Windsor with her condolences after the death of his grandmother in 2002. The email, sent on March 31, 2002, and addressed to \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d, refers to him as \u201csweet pea\u201d and says of the late Queen Mother: \u201cShe was wonderful, and I am happy that I managed to meet her and speak with her.\u201d The following day she received a reply thanking her and signed \u201cA xxx\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTodd Blanche, the deputy US attorney-general, said the material published included more than 2000 videos and 180,000 images, though not all were taken by Epstein or those close to him, and they included \u201clarge quantities of commercial pornography\u201d. The Trump administration was required by law to release all the material it holds on Epstein, who was jailed in 2009 after admitting soliciting prostitution, by December 19 last year. It had only released a fraction of the files by the deadline. The remainder of the material is believed to have now been published. Epstein\u2019s wide network of rich and powerful friends also included Donald Trump, who Epstein had claimed \u201cknew about the girls\u201d. However, Blanche insisted Trump had been exonerated by the full release of the files. He said: \u201cIn none of these communications, even when doing his best to disparage President Trump, did Epstein suggest President Trump had done anything criminal or had any inappropriate contact with any of his victims.\u201d The Telegraph, London Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what\u2019s making headlines around the world.

Got it Share A A A\n\n\u201cGoing for a swim?\u201d It had been a stinking hot day\u2019s work, and Manly beach was metres away, but the tradie wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cNot a chance, not even up to my ankles.\u201d Fear is not going in above the ankles one day, then diving straight into a rip the next. DIONNE GAIN The Manly stretch has been a sobering sight since January 19 when, in the third Sydney shark incident in barely 24 hours, a surfer was pulled from the waves at North Steyne with critical injuries. Andre de Ruyter would lose his lower leg, and the previous day at Nielsen Park in Sydney Harbour, 12-year-old Nico Antic suffered fatal injuries. Between those two events, a surfer\u2019s board was bitten at Dee Why, not far from where, a few months earlier, Mercury Psillakis died. If we are lucky, 2025-26 will be marked out as the freak year when people in Sydney became too scared of sharks to go into the water. Gradually, they\u2019re creeping back. No Nippers yet, but the heat has propelled a handful of swimmers into the water at South Manly. The Queenscliff ocean pool, warm with weed and wee, has been doing brisk business. In the last few days some swimmers, sticking tight and staying close to shore, have tested the open water. The patrolling jet skis and rubber duckies have eased off. Sirens, set off by electronic signals from tagged sharks, go off at their usual three or four times a week. If there were surfable waves (there haven\u2019t been), boardriders would be edging back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth Steyne was among a number of Sydney beaches closed after shark sightings and incidents in January. George Chan/Getty Images Fear isn\u2019t meant to be logical. One headland north, normality resumed quicker at Freshwater. South of the harbour, beach life was only momentarily interrupted, as if bull sharks only knew to turn left at Sydney Heads. There has been a widespread sense of loss, as if people have had their territorial rights to their ocean summer rescinded. Warm days have heightened this feeling that an entitlement has been taken away. As one proponent of shark culling asked, \u201cSharks can have the whole ocean. Can\u2019t we just have the first hundred metres?\u201d While understandable, these sentiments are based more in emotion and habit than evidence. It hasn\u2019t taken long for humans to get used to the idea that they own this fringe of littoral water, and that sharks, like those other beach infringers, the cabana builders, have violated their free space. I\u2019m not saying that selfish cabana people are any smarter than sharks, but regulation and negotiation can at least modify their behaviour. Sharks tend not to listen to reasoning. If a positive can be taken from this year\u2019s shark incidents, it will be to reverse some assumptions and restore respect for the ocean. It\u2019s not our swimming pool. It was never ours to take away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been an alarming, and frankly astonishing, divergence between Australians\u2019 use of the ocean and their respect for its risks. A March 2025 study by Royal Surf Lifesaving Australia found that among year 6 students, nearly half cannot swim 50 metres and tread water for two minutes. Only one in six 17-year-olds can swim the national benchmark distance of 400 metres. Swimming lessons in schools are in decline, a quarter of schools have no swimming carnivals, and Australians\u2019 swimming ability shows \u201clittle improvement\u201d after year 7. Each of these indicators had worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic, and yet the public, of all ages, is gravitating to the beach more and more. Irrational fear of sharks, as characterised in Jaws fictional Amity Island, is no better than irrational entitlement when it comes to how we interact with the ocean. Universal Pictures Notwithstanding efforts to educate people on swimming in rips, particularly from Rob \u201cDr Rip\u201d Brander, there were 357 drowning deaths in Australia last year according to the National Drowning Report, 84 of them at beaches, a 27 per cent rise on the 10-year average. Shark incidents are different, of course, but they also involve assessing risk. Calls for improved education are thrown into sharp relief by the incident at North Steyne. I was there that day. The waves were ordinary but, Manly being Manly, in normal late-afternoon conditions there would have been dozens of surfers out. Days of rain had left murky water, so there were only three surfers on the entire stretch. The rest had weighed up the chance of an infection, and the two other shark incidents, and decided not to surf. Possibly de Ruyter and the two others saw a rare chance for empty North Steyne waves. They measured the odds. The chance of a shark incident was minuscule, if well above the normal. De Ruyter was incredibly unlucky \u2013 and also incredibly lucky that the two others were there to pull him from the water. These complex calculations of risk can be inbuilt through years of experience and grounded in respect for nature. But they\u2019re still new in the scale of things. It\u2019s easy to forget how recently the coastal ocean has come into non-Indigenous use. For colonial Australians, beach swimming began only a century ago and escalated to mass popularity in the last 50 years. In a blink, society has escalated the ocean environment from something unknown to a feature of cultural identity as Australian as the quarter-acre block. Irrational fear to reckless overconfidence in two generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe high prevalence of beach drownings among inexperienced swimmers underscores how long it takes to even begin to understand the ocean. Education of this kind is not a one-day course; it\u2019s a lifelong accumulation of knowledge, of trial and error. Related Article Opinion\n\nSharks Surfers like me can\u2019t get spooked by sharks. Then the fear wins Luke Kennedy Surfer and writer If there is one hope to take from the sad sight of this January\u2019s empty beaches, it\u2019s that respect for the ocean must be rebuilt. Not fear. Fear is not going in above the ankles one day, then diving straight into a rip the next. Respect, on the other hand, is a matter of acquiring skills, calculating probabilities, figuring out when the odds are with you and when they are against you, learning from experience, and above all not taking the ocean for granted as if it\u2019s your personal playground. Being in the ocean is always a game of odds. Learning how to swim, learning rips and learning about sharky conditions are not guarantees of safety; they\u2019re only ways of tilting the odds in your favour. The decline in swimming education, coinciding with an increase in beach use, is a snapshot of irrational entitlement. Its flipside is irrational fear, Amity Island in Jaws. Fatalities on our beaches shouldn\u2019t terrify us; they should make us more humble in our approach to the ocean, more respectful, and more willing to learn. If absorbed in this way, the grim misfortunes of the past months can leave a positive legacy. Malcolm Knox is a journalist, author and columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald.",

        "text": "Fast-forward to 2025, and Fainga\u2019a found himself re-considering his earlier position. After a five-season stint with the Brumbies and a year in Perth, Fainga\u2019a had moved to France to play for Clermont. With a year left on his contract, the coach who gave him a debut at the Brumbies - Dan McKellar - was on the phone asking if he\u2019d come home to play for the Waratahs. Dave Porecki had retired, opening up a spot. The bitterness had receded, and with the chance to not only play under McKellar again, but re-ignite his Test career before the 2027 Rugby World Cup, Fainga\u2019a accepted. A decade late, Fainga\u2019a is a Waratah, and he is stoked. The 30-year-old will run out for NSW against the Reds in a trial at Ballymore on Saturday, and in a few weeks, make a Super Rugby debut for NSW as well. Fainga\u2019a\u2019s back-to-blue story is not an isolated one, either. The Waratahs squad in 2026 is littered with outstanding players who have been recruited back to their home state this season after initially being overlooked by the Tahs.\n\nNew captain Matt Philip, a former NSW under-20s skipper, had to move to Perth to debut and become a Wallaby. Pete Samu starred for Randwick and trialled with the Tahs in 2014, but left for New Zealand after missing a contract. Jack Debreczeni left for the Rebels in 2013, and Wallabies winger Harry Potter departed for Melbourne and then Leicester. All are back in Sydney with distinguished CVs and set to make Waratahs debuts next month. Matt Philip will lead the Waratahs in 2026. Credit: Peter Rae Like Fainga\u2019a, the past has been forgiven but not forgotten, given how much it shaped them as players. Unlike many Waratahs in the past who were recruited as first-pick junior talent and didn\u2019t fulfil their potential via the armchair route, the prodigal sons of 2026 were instilled with the hunger that comes from rejection. \u201cI\u2019ve always played with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder because of that, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d Philip said.\n\n\u201cThat was obviously a very strong Waratahs team back in 2013-14, they won the comp. A part of me, definitely at the time, I was super frustrated, I would have loved to play in it. \u201cBut I think I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without that kind of setback. It\u2019s made me hungry my whole career. I always wanted to prove them wrong, not making it that early in my career and having to go about things the hard way. Pete Samu left NSW and joined the Crusaders before becoming a Wallaby. Credit: Getty \u201cBut I\u2019m also really grateful to be here. I can see how lucky we are to be playing for the NSW Waratahs. This is the home of rugby in Australia.\u201d Samu was a rising star out of Melbourne who moved to Sydney in the hope of cracking the Waratahs, and was on the cusp after dominant seasons for Randwick in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\u201cThat was definitely the aim,\u201d Samu said. \u201cI was lucky enough that I was part of the academy. \u201cI got asked to do a pre-season with the Tahs - Cheik was the coach - and I played a couple of pre-season games as well. It was 2014, the start of that year. I was fighting for the last contract spot, which went to Ben Volavola at the time. But yeah, it\u2019s pretty cool to have this full circle moment.\u201d Samu\u2019s next steps were good ones - he made his debut for the Crusaders - before Cheika righted his wrong and recruited him back to Australia to play for the Brumbies and the Wallabies. Debreczeni played NSW Schools and was also in the academy, which was national but based at the Waratahs. The big-kicking No.10 also had to leave Sydney to get a start at the Rebels, and 13 years and seven clubs later, also accepted an offer from McKellar for a belated run in blue.\n\n\u201cTo see a lot of other blokes come back home, and who are keen to put on that blue jersey and represent their state, yeah, it gives good vibes around the group,\u201d Fainga\u2019a said. Loading Though a successful former Brumbies coach, McKellar has been at pains to say since taking over the Tahs last year that he doesn\u2019t want to transplant the Canberra club\u2019s style and culture. But there are definitely signs of some Brumbies\u2019 DNA being spliced in. The Brumbies built their identity on being the discards of NSW, and the hunger that came with it. McKellar has strategically sought to repatriate lost Tahs - many of them from the Brumbies. He also signed Warringah\u2019s Test flanker Luke Reimer for next year, too. \u201cWe want to be a club, an organisation - there\u2019s no shortage of talent in New South Wales - where we retain and develop our best young players,\u201d McKellar said.",

        "text": "A Chinese personal safety app called Are You Dead? \u2014 recently rebranded as Demumu \u2014 has gone viral in recent weeks, attracting widespread media attention.\n\nBehind its sudden popularity lie deeper social transformations, including demographic shifts and changing personal and family relationships.\n\nAt the same time, demand is growing for trust-based, non-medical, easy-to-use care networks tailored to the rapid rise of one-person households.\n\nDemumu also shows how digital technologies are not only responding to everyday safety concerns but also reshaping social and cultural norms.\n\nAs traditional kinship ties and community support structures weaken, technology is stepping in to fill \u2014 and capitalise on \u2014 the gaps.\n\nDemumu's virality: from local to global\n\nIn mid-2025, with a development cost of around 1,500 yuan ($308), three young Chinese professionals from Moonscape Technologies launched a personal safety app called Are You Dead?.\n\nThe app was designed to address the safety concerns of China's growing population of people who live alone. As described on its official store page, the app aims to \"protect every solitary moment with simple solutions and build a solid safety line for solo living\".\n\nUsers are prompted to click an on-screen button daily or fortnightly via their smartphone to verify they are alive. If a user fails to do so, the system automatically sends email alerts to two nominated emergency contacts.\n\nShortly after the app's release, it went viral and quickly became the most downloaded paid app in China.\n\nA 10 per cent stake in the company reportedly increased in value from 1 million yuan ($205,834) to nearly 10 million yuan ($2 million) within three days. This suggests an overall valuation of close to 100 million yuan ($20.57 million) for the developer.\n\nIn mid-January 2026, the app rebranded as Demumu as part of a global expansion.\n\nIt has now gained traction in more than 40 countries and is ranked near the top in global markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nChina is moving towards smaller families and more individualised lives\n\nThe 2020 China Population Census showed there were more than 125 million one-person households in China. That's one in every four households in the country.\n\nAround two-thirds of these solo dwellers are aged between 20 and 59. It is estimated there will be 200 million such households by 2030.\n\nThe rapid rise of solo living in China can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirst, a growing number of 'empty nest' older adults. This has been caused by population ageing, and the decline of marriage and fertility while divorce rates rise. These trends have been intensified by longer life expectancy and the legacy of the decades-long One Child Policy.\n\nREAD MORE China reimposes taxes on condoms, contraceptive drugs to spur flagging birth rate\n\nSecond, intimate relationships and family formation have become less attainable for many.\n\nMen are often expected to own a home and a car even at the courtship stage, which is increasingly difficult due to rising living costs and high property prices. 'Bride prices' \u2014 paid by a man's family to a woman's before marriage \u2014 are also escalating.\n\nThird, large-scale migration from rural to urban areas and between cities has produced many 'split households'.\n\nMillions of 'empty-nest youths' live alone for extended periods under intense work-related pressures before forming or reuniting with families. A common anxiety among this group is 'disappearing in loneliness'.\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Loneliness - the hidden health danger SBS News 06:37 English\n\nNumerous reports have documented 'empty nesters' who died and were only found days, weeks, or even months later, particularly in gated urban communities. These incidents highlight the vulnerabilities associated with solo living, as well as the absence of trust-based safety networks.\n\nThis is a problem Demumu seeks to address.\n\nMoreover, among younger generations in China \u2013 particularly highly educated urban women \u2013 attitudes towards marriage and singlehood are shifting. Living alone is increasingly a deliberate choice.\n\nCareer development and personal autonomy are becoming higher priorities. Many women wish to avoid taking on a disproportionate share of domestic and caregiving responsibilities.\n\nSolo living: a high-potential market\n\nChina's singles economy is booming, and the market still has significant room to grow.\n\nIn major metropolitan centres such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, products and services tailored to people living alone are more and more visible.\n\nThese include one-person hotpot restaurants, single-person karaoke booths, and micro-apartments designed for solo dwellers. Compact household appliances such as mini-fridges, coffee machines, and kettles are also readily available, as well as solo travel packages offered by tourism agencies.\n\nCompanionship of various kinds is also on offer. Owning pets \u2014 particularly dogs and cats \u2014 often plays an important role in the everyday lives of people who live alone.\n\nThe intimate services market has also expanded rapidly through digital platforms and smartphone apps. This includes love mentoring and relationship counselling, online dating and digital romance games.\n\nAI-powered chatbot companions and humanoid dolls designed to meet the emotional and relational needs of solo dwellers are also becoming more common.\n\nThere's also an emerging niche business known as date-renting. This practice was initially popularised among young 'bare branches' seeking to bring a temporary partner home for Lunar New Year family gatherings.\n\nREAD MORE 2026 Lunar New Year: Celebrations Across Australia You Need to Know\n\nHowever, date-renting has since evolved into a personalised service economy in which individuals exchange intimacy, companionship, and dating experiences. In the process, dating is transformed into an 'emotional commodity', made visible for public consumption and increasingly shaped by platform profiteering.\n\nTogether with the emergence of safety apps such as Demumu, these singles-oriented businesses and technologies are energising China's solo-driven economy.\n\nMore importantly, they are also filling the gaps left by shrinking families and increasingly individualised living arrangements. In the process, they are reshaping contemporary social and personal relations and normalising single-centred cultures and lifestyles in everyday life.\n\nPan Wang is an associate professor in Chinese and Asian Studies at UNSW Sydney.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nContinuing a family tradition that began in the late 1800s, Robert Mackenzie raises Black Angus cattle for sale locally and worldwide.\n\n\"China is a key part of our operation, they're taking roughly about 10 per cent of our production every month. And we're supplying a high-quality product from paddock to plate. And Australia has worked extremely hard to build that trust in China. Personally, I've been to China 16 times in ten years, so that shows our commitment to China.\"\n\nChinese television has even featured a live cross to Mr Mackenzie\u2019s Port Stephens property, promoting sustainability.\n\n\"To be featured in China TV, where 80 million people watched us - my family, my father - cook Australian red meat in the paddock right here is humbling, but that goes to show that China values our quality beef.\"\n\nHowever, from January, China\u2019s new rules will add a 55 per cent tariff to Australian beef imports exceeding specific quotas.\n\nThe Australian Meat Industry Council predicts a financial hit of up to $1 billion, as CEO Tim Ryan explains.\n\n\"A billion dollars is a lot of beef to redirect at relatively short notice and particularly for beef supply chains that aren't just a short-term decision. These animals have grown over multiple years and produced for certain markets. The last time I looked, there's not another China out there on the world market, so it's really hard to replace a destination with the scale and wealth of consumers as China.\"\n\nAustralia exported almost 300,000 tonnes of beef to China last year.\n\nMr Ryan says the new tariffs may cut that by a third.\n\n\"Australia's become a major supply of beef into the China market and over the last couple of decades, Chinese consumers have learned to love Australian beef. So, it'll hurt Australian producers that have targeted the China market specifically and they're the producers that will have to, I suppose, reconsider their business model going forward.\"\n\nTo protect its local industry, China has capped beef imports from Australia and several countries for the next three years.\n\n\"Under these new trade measures, Australia will be largely limited to trade about 205,000 tonnes of beef into the China market before 55% tariffs are triggered, which would largely make trade prohibitive for many exporters beyond that.\"\n\nCharcoal Chen is a China-based sales manager for an Australian cattle farm, with more than 20 years\u2019 experience.\n\nHe expects exporters of premium beef like Black Angus and Wagyu to be hardest hit.\n\n\"Structurally, lower-end grass-fed products are not heavily affected. The biggest impact will be on mid-to long-term grain-fed products, such as Wagyu, where volumes are relatively large.\"\n\nAnd that\u2019s forcing producers like Robert Mackenzie, who has cattle already fattening in feed lots, to urgently seek new markets.\n\n\"Our cattle are grass fed, grain finished. But those animals go into the feedlot for up to 200 days. And this is definitely put a speed bump in front of our operation that again, we have to scramble to work out exactly what are we going to do?\"\n\nMr Chen says exporters of chilled beef, which has a shorter shelf life, will be among the first forced to adapt.\n\n\"I expect the higher tariff to be enforced in the third quarter, around July or August 2026. Some distributors will encourage chilled-beef customers to switch to frozen products and increase frozen purchases in the first half to fill the supply gap later in this year.\"\n\nOther beef producing countries and big Australian producers are expected to move swiftly quickly to secure market share, says Mr Chen.\n\n\"It is survival of the fittest. If you hesitate and wait, you will be eliminated. Producers will have to adjust, whether by changing sales strategies, redirecting products to other markets, or absorbing them domestically.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge for family producers like Robert Mackenzie who runs 3,500 commercial cows on eight properties.\n\n\"It's disappointing. We've worked as a family extremely hard on developing that market. We've spent a lot of money, a lot of money in China. It's not as simple as just going out and finding another market.\"",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nThe smell of dinner for a growing family of six is wafting through the house in Melbourne's outer west.\n\nIt's the typical routine for any family in suburban Australia, but for the Manuellas, it's still completely new.\n\nIt was barely two weeks ago that Telieta Kaumaile and their four children arrived.\n\nTelieta says it's a reality still dawning on her.\n\n'It's not like we're just coming on a vacation, it's like we are staying. It's a new home and it's a new journey. We realised that in the past few days. Tuvalu will always be in our heart and our home, but Australia is another new chapter to our family journey's life.'\n\nThe Manuellas are here on a special new visa stream, called the Falepili Mobility Pathway.\n\nIt's available to 280 Tuvaluan applicants each year, decided by random ballot.\n\nTelieta worked for Tuvalu's department of labour, while her husbad Kaumaile was in the government's public works department with a background in architecture.\n\nThe couple decided they would be among the more than 8,700 people to apply for the visa.\n\n'We came to the conclusion that in case we were selected, it would be a good opportunity in terms of better life, better education for our children, better job opportunities.'\n\nThe prospect of being chosen was a one in more than 30 chance.\n\nKaumaile recalls the moment he heard the unlikely news his family had been successful.\n\n'I was actually in the shower *laughs* ... It was funny, I was in the shower and then came out of the room, and my wife was on the phone. I saw her face was like changing, it was like surprised. So I said 'oh, what happened?' and I thought something happened to her family or relative. But actually she just told me that we're on, we got an email saying that we'd been selected.'\n\nThe new visa grants migrants from Tuvalu permanent residency in Australia.\n\nProfessor Jane McAdam, Director of the University of New South Wales' Evacuations Research Hub, explains the visa doesn't require applicants to have work or study plans already arranged.\n\n'It provides opportunities for what we call livelihood diversification, it enables kids to go to school in Australia, for people to acquire further skills and training which they might want to use here, but equally might want to take back to Tuvalu, and I think that's why this is something that the Tuvaluan government actually requested from Australia, because it sees it as embedding that skills diversification, that broader opportunity for remittances to be sent back to Tuvalu to support the economy there, rather than this being a one-way street for people to leave Tuvalu.'\n\nThe Tuvaluan diaspora in Melbourne is small but tight-knit.\n\nThe Manuellas consider themselves lucky to be staying with a relative, Niuelesolo Boland.\n\nHe's also deeply involved with the community and helps newcomers from Tuvalu adjust to life here.\n\n'I personally think that the Australian government could do a little bit more. I think it's falling back on the Tuvaluan diaspora in Australia to pick up the burden. Like a lot of them are looking at forms like 'what is this?' you know? Coming from Tuvalu where we don't even have tax file numbers you know? Or a Medicare scheme. So to them it's totally foreign.'\n\nWhile the Falepili Mobility Pathway has proven hugely popular in Tuvalu, one expert has taken issue with the random nature of the visa ballot system.\n\nDr Yvonne Su, from Harvard University's School of Public Health, points to the fact this visa was partially designed to assist those on the frontline of climate change and rising sea levels.\n\n'Climate change is not random. Climate change doesn't just happen to anybody, unfortunately, right. So, because climate change is not by chance, it frightens me that we've allowed the people on this visa, that I have to say has been branded with climate change resilience as a big part of it, and saying climate mobility and saying you're protecting them from climate change as a big part of it, you're saying that could be by chance.'\n\nBut the Federal Minister for Pacific Affairs, Pat Conroy, says the random nature of the ballot is critical to the treaty.\n\n'The thing that we definitely need to avoid is brain drain. If you didn't have a ballot system that introduced an element of random selection, in the end the people who would qualify first for this visa would be the people with the highest educational and professional qualifications within Tuvalu, and that would lead to a brain drain.'\n\nBack in Melbourne, both Kaumaile and Telieta are grateful, but also deeply aware of the threat climate change poses to their home country.\n\n'In another 50 years they say Tuvalu will be gone. But my countrymen they're still fighting, at the moment they're still fighting. But we just fought for the betterment of our family, to come here and use this opportunity.'",

        "text": "Professor Henry Brodaty has dedicated his life to dementia research and care.\n\nIt was seeing his father\u2019s diagnosis and death with the disease at just 59-years-old that led him to want to understand more about dementia.\n\nBrodaty, now 78, holds the titles of professor of ageing and mental health and co-director of UNSW Sydney\u2019s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA) \u2014 and was on Australia day awarded the Senior Australian of the Year honour.\n\nMore than 420,000 Australians were living with dementia in 2024, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and the disease was the leading cause of death in Australia in 2023.\n\nDementia is not one specific disease but is an umbrella term for a group of symptoms caused by disorders affecting the brain.\n\nREAD MORE More than a million Australians could be living with dementia in 40 years. These are possible risk factors\n\nDementia can impact memory, speech, thought, personality, behaviour and mobility. It is a degenerative, terminal illness.\n\nThe most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHowever, research published in the Lancet Commission in 2024 that 45 per cent of dementia cases are avoidable through lifestyle changes.\n\nIn his acceptance speech for the Senior Australian of the Year Award, Brodaty called for a whole-of-life approach to brain health.\n\nAfter spending most of his life trying to understand the disease, he shared with SBS News measures one can take to reduce or delay the risk of developing dementia.\n\nGet moving\n\nBrodaty said that \"both aerobic and strength training\" is good for reducing the risk of dementia, and encourages people to \"pull or push weight a couple days a week\".\n\nCHeBA notes that exercise is one of the best medicines available, and reduces the risk of not only dementia, but an array of other conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, obesity and depression.\n\n\"Build regular exercise into your schedule \u2014 make time for it,\" Brodaty said.\n\n\"Going for a walk with your friend and chatting probably isn\u2019t enough. You need to get puffed and sweaty.\"\n\nUse your brain\n\nMuch like exercise, complex mental activity strengthens and enhances the function of the brain.\n\nBy learning throughout our lives and supporting kids\u2019 education, we can reduce the risk of dementia.\n\n\"In the early stages of life, it\u2019s getting an education \u2014 the more education you have, the greater your cognitive reserve. It\u2019s like a buffer,\" he told SBS.\n\nProfessor Henry Brodaty AO has reshaped the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of dementia, enhancing the lives of countless people in Australia and around the world. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\n\"So we may build up pathology in our brain, but our ability to withstand the effects of it are improved if we have more cognitive reserve. And that whole process of buffering against pathology is called resilience. So it's cognitive resilience.\"\n\nThe CHeBA recommends not only formal education, but also learning a new skill, language or dance, socialising, volunteering and brain training as ways to ensure complex mental activity.\n\nEating a good diet\n\n\"Particularly based on the Mediterranean diet: lots of vegetables, legumes, extra virgin olive oil, almonds, walnuts,\" Brodaty said.\n\nHe also encourages people to avoid drinking excess alcohol.\n\nCHeBA recommends a healthy, balanced diet rich in micronutrients, proteins, essential oils and complex carbohydrates.\n\nIn 2024, two new dementia risk factors were updated to the standing Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care. One of them being high LDL [Low-density lipoprotein, otherwise known as \"bad\"] cholesterol. It\u2019s important to monitor your cholesterol and reduce consuming foods with high saturated and trans fats.\n\nProtect your head\n\n\"People worry more about their hair than what\u2019s underneath it. We should treasure our brains,\" Brodaty said.\n\nHe encourages the use of helmets when riding bicycles or playing contact sports.\n\n\"We need to be as conscious of our brains as we do our heart.\"\n\nBrodaty and a team of researchers ran a study called Maintain Your Brain which involved 8,000 people between the ages of 55 and 77 who did not already have dementia.\n\nThey found that through online coaching and support in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, brain training and mental health, the participant\u2019s overall cognition improved.\n\nThis was compared to the other half of participants who only received publicly available information on dementia and risk reduction.\n\n\"The group that got the coaching improved almost three times as much ... we think our program delayed the onset at least a year.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

I made a very clear commitment that existing participants would stay on the program subject to all the usual rules. But state and territories in the Commonwealth agreed way back in 2023 that far too many young children were ending up on the NDIS. In some parts of the country, as many as one in four young boys were ending up on a scheme that was established for severe and permanent disability.\"\n\n---\n\nOlder Australians are waiting an average of eight months* [[245 days]] to get access to home support services, which includes showering, meal preparation and cleaning.\n\nThe data in the Productivity Commission's Report on Government Services represents almost a doubling in the median wait time over the last financial year.\n\nA spokesman for Aged Care Minister Sam Rae says action is being taken to reduce wait times. The spokesperson says the report includes data that predates the government\u2019s aged care reforms, including a new single assessment system which came in at the start of 2025.\n\nThe federal government announced the release of 20,000 home care packages late last year, and another 63,000 by the middle of this year.\n\nOverall, Australia spent nearly $40 billion on aged care in the 2024/25 financial year, up from $38 billion the previous year.\n\n---\n\nEmergency services have found the body of a 16-year-old boy in the Blue Mountains, after he lost touch with his friend while on a camping trip.\n\nHe and his 17-year-old friend travelled by train to Leura, 80 kilometres west of Sydney, and then set off for Mount Hay on foot as part of a 3-day trip.\n\nPolice say the older boy activated his personal locator beacon on Wednesday evening after they became separated.\n\nEmergency crews rescued the 17-year-old, while the other teen's body was found nearby in a creek.\n\nA report will be prepared for the coroner.\n\n---\n\nUS border chief Tom Homan says federal agents will focus on targeted operations, shifting away from broad street sweeps that have provoked outrage in America and abroad.\n\nMr Homan admitted the federal immigration agency ICE could \"do better\" - in a rare acknowledgment from the administration that their operations had not been perfect.\n\nThis follows the fatal shooting of two U-S citizens in Minneapolis by ICE agents in the past month.\n\nMr Homan adds he would reduce the number of agents deployed to the city if he received cooperation from state and local leaders.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey says there are serious concerns about the operation and the way it has been conducted.\n\n\"What's become clear to me is this is obviously not about safety. This is not even about immigration. This is about silencing a narrative or a political position that differs from that of a federal administration. We've seen this kind of conduct in other countries. We cannot see it right here in America.\"\n\n---\n\nIn Tennis, world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka has welcomed the possibility of Serena Williams' return to the sport.\n\nThe 23-time grand slam singles champion did not rule out a potential comeback when interviewed on the NBC's Today Show.\n\nSerena Williams: I am just having fun and enjoying me life right now.\n\nInterviewer: Okay, but that's not a yes or a no.\n\nSerena Williams: That is not a yes or a no. I don't know. I'm going to see what happens. I have two kids. When I filled out the form the other day - occupation? I put down housewife. Listen, I can't discuss this.

Got it Share A A A\n\nCABARET\n\nAmplified\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, January 30\n\nUntil February 8\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Long after Chrissy Amphlett\u2019s band Divinyls ground to a halt, she imagined doing a one-woman theatrical show about herself and her songs. Having spent her Divinyls career playing a fiery, racy, pouting, unpredictable schoolgirl, she wanted a character this time, too, reportedly settling on a crow. It was never to be. She died of breast cancer before the half-formed dream took flight. Enter Sheridan Harbridge, Glenn Moorhouse and Sarah Goodes. Together, they envisaged a ghost of the show Amphlett had contemplated, subtitling it The Exquisite Rock and Rage of Chrissy Amphlett. Harbridge wrote it, with Moorhouse as musical director and Goodes directing Harbridge\u2019s performance. They\u2019ve done a storming job. Sheridan Harbridge as Chrissy Amphlett in a potent performance. Jade Ellis Harbridge doesn\u2019t become Chrissy, in the sense that the story is told in the third person, but Amphlett\u2019s spirit is alive and living dangerously inside Harbridge\u2019s performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a range the latter has, from being the best Blanche I\u2019ve seen in A Streetcar Named Desire, to now exploding off the stage with a singing voice I didn\u2019t know she had, that could be brutally powerful when required, yet also sweetly soulful. Harbridge\u2019s voice can be brutally powerful but also sweetly soulful. Jade Ellis Beyond the potency of her performance and the engaging storytelling, the music and spoken word are interwoven so that a Divinyls hit might start, shudder to a stop while Harbridge tells us more, pick up again, and repeat this process. It\u2019s done so well that you\u2019re not cursing the fact that they won\u2019t get on with the song; you\u2019re engrossed in an ever-growing tension that finally finds release when the song takes centre-stage. Sheridan Harbridge in full flight. Jade Ellis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother strength is the music itself, with Moorhouse (on guitar) joined by Clarabell Limonta (keyboard), Ben Cripps (bass) and Dave Hatch (drums). I never particularly rated Divinyls as a band, compared with their songs and Amphlett\u2019s performance of them. Moorhouse and company have knocked some bricks out of the wall of sound and replaced them with nuance, without losing the kick to the surging chorus of, say, Boys in Town. Related Article What\u2019s on Chrissy Amphlett wrote a show in which she was a crow. Years after her death, her vision lives on The fearless Harbridge, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t just enter the audience, she invades it. She\u2019s also funny, and the humour makes for a completeness of emotional impact, given the inherent sadness of a story of excess, of Amphlett\u2019s repeatedly having to smash the same glass ceiling, and then suffering multiple sclerosis before the cancer hit. Perhaps it\u2019s also so moving because the show exudes such immense affection for its subject. If the intensity of grip is released a little in the final phase, it\u2019s certainly reasserted when they launch into I Touch Myself, the song that made the teenage Harbridge a fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspect Amphlett would approve. She\u2019d have appreciated the absence of hagiography and sugar-coating, and she may have recognised a fellow traveller in the high-stakes game of being audacious on stage. She may have even stood up with the rest of us at the end. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.",

As it turns out, his reply is somewhat incorrect, too. Yes, the menu at Antep Mangal Victoria Park \u2013 a shiny 40-seat Turkish takeaway that opened on New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 features doner kebab meat, a key component of the meat box, also known as the halal snack pack or HSP. Yes, the menu also includes chips: thick, crunchy blocks of potato that are the colour of a Simpsons character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut no, the menu doesn\u2019t include an option to order both items together, or at least not in a box, drowned in sauces. Veteran chef Celal Per cutting slices of meat off a yaprak (leaf) doner. Matt O'Donohue Restaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox. Sign up A theory: maybe dad is a regular at the original Antep Mangal that Welat Yilmaz and Hasan Siringul opened six years ago on Beaufort Street to address the shish kebab, gozleme, pide and meat box deficiencies that the area was facing? So when news broke that Antep Mangal was expanding south, it\u2019s a given that venue number two would offer the same menu, right? Wrong. Instead, Yilmaz and Siringul want you to consider getting your doner hit via more traditional formats. As an Iskender, perhaps: a saucy arrangement of meat, tomato sauce and melted butter, piled on flatbread and presented alongside a cooling snowdrift of tangy yoghurt. Turkey has strong historical ties to Central Asia, hence the prevalence of dairy in its cuisine. (See the house-made ayran, a mildly salted drinking yoghurt.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe you could try the doner plate that invites buttery rice, unusually verdant salad plus fluffy bulgur (cracked wheat) simmered in the Turkish capsicum paste biber salcasi to the party. It\u2019s an option that doesn\u2019t just help you tick off your five serves of veg for the day: it also showcases the chew and eating quality of the meat itself. Look carefully at the hunk of flesh slowly gyrating on the vertical spit in the open kitchen, and you\u2019ll spy countless strata lines throughout. This is no garden-variety doner, but a yaprak or \u201cleaf\u201d doner: its name a reference to the layers \u2013 or leaves \u2013 of lamb and beef that veteran chef Celal Per uses to build each towering mille-feuille of meat. Per is also on cutting duties and shaves slices off the doner in both long strips and short patches to create different mouthfeels and textures. The kicker? The yaprak is exclusive to Antep Mangal\u2019s new Vic Park spin-off. Related Article Pop-up prodigies drop a line in Perth\u2019s north Like the Mount Lawley mothership, all the skewers (shish) are grilled to order over compressed charcoal. Crucially, the mangal \u2013 the Turkish word for \u201cgrill\u201d \u2013 smoulders all day, meaning char-grilled meat is available from just before lunch to early supper and any time in between. (Many grill places, perhaps understandably, only light their charcoal at night and during peak periods.) True, you\u2019ll wait longer for your shish here than some places, but the juiciness and controlled char of finished dishes suggests that your patience isn\u2019t going unrewarded. My pick of the shish is the adana, a succulent blend of minced beef and lamb, capsicum and spice that\u2019s pressed by hand onto each skewer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkewers of meat being grilled over the charcoal-fuelled mangal. Matt O'Donohue In addition to being served with rice and salad, these shish can also be ordered as kebabs tucked into puffy sleeves of Turkish bread alongside red onion, diced tomato, some leafy things and nothing else. No questions about sauces. No egg upsell. No double-meat option. These are minimalist kebabs that have been deliberately designed to not just highlight the quality of the meat, but also to quietly reinforce the restaurant\u2019s less-is-more mantra. Vic Park\u2019s menu might not cover as much ground as Mount Lawley\u2019s, but it takes diners closer to Turkey. That kebab bread, by the by, is one of many items made in-house. There\u2019s also an assortment of boat-shaped pide that are either baked open-faced or sealed like a pastie depending on its filling. They\u2019re good eating, but my picks among the baked goods are the lahmacun (thin flatbreads of impressive finesse topped with minced lamb and beef) and the excellent baklava, dense with walnuts and crowned with tanned, ruffled edges of crunchy yufka pastry. Related Article Good Food hat 15 / 20 Review This fine dining destination in the Perth Hills embodies the spirit (and flavours) of Australia Yet for all the understated detail in its cooking, Antep Mangal looks a lot like your average neighbourhood kebab joint. Diners order at a long counter. (The layout of the room occasionally causes bottlenecks if there\u2019s a queue and staff need to deliver food to dine-in guests.) Extraction fans work valiantly to yank out all that smoke but aren\u2019t quite strong enough. The fridge is filled with multinational soft drinks. But don\u2019t be fooled. Beneath this unassuming exterior is a shop cooking and serving some quietly impressive Turkish food. I dig it. A lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I also dig Turkish cuisine\u2019s wilder, less-classical moments too, not least the restorative power of a saucy, two-handed kebab at the end of a night out. (But please don\u2019t bring alcohol to Antep Mangal, it\u2019s a halal restaurant.) Some might suggest that makes me a bogan. I prefer the term open-minded. This town, I think, is big enough for both styles of Turkish food. For anyone keen to think and eat outside the (meat) box, Vic Park awaits. The low-down Atmosphere: a promising second act gently expanding the public\u2019s perception of Turkish food. Go-to dishes: adana shish kebab ($20), Yaprak doner plate ($27), lahmahcun ($10). Drinks: the Turkish salted drinking yoghurt ayran supplemented with a fridge full of multinational soft drinks (no BYO). Cost: about $65 for two people, excluding drinks.

Related Article Epstein fallout US Justice Department releases millions of pages of Epstein documents Seven years after his death, Epstein continues to cast a long shadow over those who were in his orbit \u2013 and Gates, once the world\u2019s richest man, is among them. On July 18, 2013, Epstein sent a memo to himself including a number of allegations about Gates. It said: \u201cTo add insult to the injury you them [sic] implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your penis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein sent himself another email at 1.03 the same morning, announcing a resignation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Epstein never worked for the foundation, so it is believed he was writing the email in someone else\u2019s voice. Gates was given an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2005, in recognition of his services to charity. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire but is not known as \u201cSir\u201d, a title reserved only for British citizens. It is likely there will now be calls for the honour to be revoked, though Whitehall sources would not be drawn on whether No.10 would back such a move. A spokesman for Gates said: \u201cThese claims are absolutely absurd and completely false. \u201cThe only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein\u2019s frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates, and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFresh questions for Mandelson Other files raise fresh questions about the relationship between Epstein and Lord Mandelson, who was sacked as the British ambassador to Washington last year over previous revelations about his links to a man he called his \u201cbest pal\u201d. Lord Mandelson referred to Epstein as \u201ca good friend and totally trustworthy\u201d in another newly released message. In a separate July 2011 email, Lord Mandelson asked Epstein, \u201cwhat u doing?\u201d Epstein replied: \u201cSpent the day with Gates, in Seattle.

The files show that Epstein introduced him to a 26-year-old Russian woman in 2010, after his conviction for soliciting prostitution. In emails to a contact listed as \u201cThe Duke\u201d, Epstein wrote: \u201cI have a friend who i think you might enjoy having dinner with, her name is irina she will be london 20-24 [sic].\u201d In response, the former Duke of York appeared to reply: \u201cOf course. I am in Geneva until the morning of 22nd but would be delighted to see her. Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.\u201d It was signed \u201cHRH The Duke of York KG\u201d. Epstein later clarified the woman was \u201c26, Russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther emails between Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for child trafficking, were also published on Friday.

The Trump administration was required by law to release all the material it holds on Epstein, who was jailed in 2009 after admitting soliciting prostitution, by December 19 last year. It had only released a fraction of the files by the deadline. The remainder of the material is believed to have now been published. Epstein\u2019s wide network of rich and powerful friends also included Donald Trump, who Epstein had claimed \u201cknew about the girls\u201d. However, Blanche insisted Trump had been exonerated by the full release of the files.

Between those two events, a surfer\u2019s board was bitten at Dee Why, not far from where, a few months earlier, Mercury Psillakis died. If we are lucky, 2025-26 will be marked out as the freak year when people in Sydney became too scared of sharks to go into the water. Gradually, they\u2019re creeping back. No Nippers yet, but the heat has propelled a handful of swimmers into the water at South Manly. The Queenscliff ocean pool, warm with weed and wee, has been doing brisk business. In the last few days some swimmers, sticking tight and staying close to shore, have tested the open water. The patrolling jet skis and rubber duckies have eased off. Sirens, set off by electronic signals from tagged sharks, go off at their usual three or four times a week. If there were surfable waves (there haven\u2019t been), boardriders would be edging back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth Steyne was among a number of Sydney beaches closed after shark sightings and incidents in January. George Chan/Getty Images Fear isn\u2019t meant to be logical. One headland north, normality resumed quicker at Freshwater. South of the harbour, beach life was only momentarily interrupted, as if bull sharks only knew to turn left at Sydney Heads. There has been a widespread sense of loss, as if people have had their territorial rights to their ocean summer rescinded. Warm days have heightened this feeling that an entitlement has been taken away. As one proponent of shark culling asked, \u201cSharks can have the whole ocean. Can\u2019t we just have the first hundred metres?\u201d While understandable, these sentiments are based more in emotion and habit than evidence. It hasn\u2019t taken long for humans to get used to the idea that they own this fringe of littoral water, and that sharks, like those other beach infringers, the cabana builders, have violated their free space. I\u2019m not saying that selfish cabana people are any smarter than sharks, but regulation and negotiation can at least modify their behaviour. Sharks tend not to listen to reasoning. If a positive can be taken from this year\u2019s shark incidents, it will be to reverse some assumptions and restore respect for the ocean. It\u2019s not our swimming pool. It was never ours to take away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been an alarming, and frankly astonishing, divergence between Australians\u2019 use of the ocean and their respect for its risks. A March 2025 study by Royal Surf Lifesaving Australia found that among year 6 students, nearly half cannot swim 50 metres and tread water for two minutes. Only one in six 17-year-olds can swim the national benchmark distance of 400 metres. Swimming lessons in schools are in decline, a quarter of schools have no swimming carnivals, and Australians\u2019 swimming ability shows \u201clittle improvement\u201d after year 7. Each of these indicators had worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic, and yet the public, of all ages, is gravitating to the beach more and more. Irrational fear of sharks, as characterised in Jaws fictional Amity Island, is no better than irrational entitlement when it comes to how we interact with the ocean. Universal Pictures Notwithstanding efforts to educate people on swimming in rips, particularly from Rob \u201cDr Rip\u201d Brander, there were 357 drowning deaths in Australia last year according to the National Drowning Report, 84 of them at beaches, a 27 per cent rise on the 10-year average. Shark incidents are different, of course, but they also involve assessing risk. Calls for improved education are thrown into sharp relief by the incident at North Steyne. I was there that day. The waves were ordinary but, Manly being Manly, in normal late-afternoon conditions there would have been dozens of surfers out. Days of rain had left murky water, so there were only three surfers on the entire stretch. The rest had weighed up the chance of an infection, and the two other shark incidents, and decided not to surf. Possibly de Ruyter and the two others saw a rare chance for empty North Steyne waves. They measured the odds. The chance of a shark incident was minuscule, if well above the normal. De Ruyter was incredibly unlucky \u2013 and also incredibly lucky that the two others were there to pull him from the water. These complex calculations of risk can be inbuilt through years of experience and grounded in respect for nature. But they\u2019re still new in the scale of things. It\u2019s easy to forget how recently the coastal ocean has come into non-Indigenous use. For colonial Australians, beach swimming began only a century ago and escalated to mass popularity in the last 50 years. In a blink, society has escalated the ocean environment from something unknown to a feature of cultural identity as Australian as the quarter-acre block. Irrational fear to reckless overconfidence in two generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe high prevalence of beach drownings among inexperienced swimmers underscores how long it takes to even begin to understand the ocean. Education of this kind is not a one-day course; it\u2019s a lifelong accumulation of knowledge, of trial and error. Related Article Opinion\n\nSharks Surfers like me can\u2019t get spooked by sharks. Then the fear wins Luke Kennedy Surfer and writer If there is one hope to take from the sad sight of this January\u2019s empty beaches, it\u2019s that respect for the ocean must be rebuilt. Not fear. Fear is not going in above the ankles one day, then diving straight into a rip the next. Respect, on the other hand, is a matter of acquiring skills, calculating probabilities, figuring out when the odds are with you and when they are against you, learning from experience, and above all not taking the ocean for granted as if it\u2019s your personal playground. Being in the ocean is always a game of odds. Learning how to swim, learning rips and learning about sharky conditions are not guarantees of safety; they\u2019re only ways of tilting the odds in your favour. The decline in swimming education, coinciding with an increase in beach use, is a snapshot of irrational entitlement. Its flipside is irrational fear, Amity Island in Jaws. Fatalities on our beaches shouldn\u2019t terrify us; they should make us more humble in our approach to the ocean, more respectful, and more willing to learn. If absorbed in this way, the grim misfortunes of the past months can leave a positive legacy. Malcolm Knox is a journalist, author and columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald.",

        "text": "Fast-forward to 2025, and Fainga\u2019a found himself re-considering his earlier position. After a five-season stint with the Brumbies and a year in Perth, Fainga\u2019a had moved to France to play for Clermont. With a year left on his contract, the coach who gave him a debut at the Brumbies - Dan McKellar - was on the phone asking if he\u2019d come home to play for the Waratahs. Dave Porecki had retired, opening up a spot. The bitterness had receded, and with the chance to not only play under McKellar again, but re-ignite his Test career before the 2027 Rugby World Cup, Fainga\u2019a accepted. A decade late, Fainga\u2019a is a Waratah, and he is stoked. The 30-year-old will run out for NSW against the Reds in a trial at Ballymore on Saturday, and in a few weeks, make a Super Rugby debut for NSW as well. Fainga\u2019a\u2019s back-to-blue story is not an isolated one, either. The Waratahs squad in 2026 is littered with outstanding players who have been recruited back to their home state this season after initially being overlooked by the Tahs.\n\nNew captain Matt Philip, a former NSW under-20s skipper, had to move to Perth to debut and become a Wallaby. Pete Samu starred for Randwick and trialled with the Tahs in 2014, but left for New Zealand after missing a contract. Jack Debreczeni left for the Rebels in 2013, and Wallabies winger Harry Potter departed for Melbourne and then Leicester. All are back in Sydney with distinguished CVs and set to make Waratahs debuts next month. Matt Philip will lead the Waratahs in 2026. Credit: Peter Rae Like Fainga\u2019a, the past has been forgiven but not forgotten, given how much it shaped them as players. Unlike many Waratahs in the past who were recruited as first-pick junior talent and didn\u2019t fulfil their potential via the armchair route, the prodigal sons of 2026 were instilled with the hunger that comes from rejection. \u201cI\u2019ve always played with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder because of that, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d Philip said.\n\n\u201cThat was obviously a very strong Waratahs team back in 2013-14, they won the comp. A part of me, definitely at the time, I was super frustrated, I would have loved to play in it. \u201cBut I think I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without that kind of setback. It\u2019s made me hungry my whole career. I always wanted to prove them wrong, not making it that early in my career and having to go about things the hard way. Pete Samu left NSW and joined the Crusaders before becoming a Wallaby. Credit: Getty \u201cBut I\u2019m also really grateful to be here. I can see how lucky we are to be playing for the NSW Waratahs. This is the home of rugby in Australia.\u201d Samu was a rising star out of Melbourne who moved to Sydney in the hope of cracking the Waratahs, and was on the cusp after dominant seasons for Randwick in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\u201cThat was definitely the aim,\u201d Samu said. \u201cI was lucky enough that I was part of the academy. \u201cI got asked to do a pre-season with the Tahs - Cheik was the coach - and I played a couple of pre-season games as well. It was 2014, the start of that year. I was fighting for the last contract spot, which went to Ben Volavola at the time. But yeah, it\u2019s pretty cool to have this full circle moment.\u201d Samu\u2019s next steps were good ones - he made his debut for the Crusaders - before Cheika righted his wrong and recruited him back to Australia to play for the Brumbies and the Wallabies. Debreczeni played NSW Schools and was also in the academy, which was national but based at the Waratahs. The big-kicking No.10 also had to leave Sydney to get a start at the Rebels, and 13 years and seven clubs later, also accepted an offer from McKellar for a belated run in blue.\n\n\u201cTo see a lot of other blokes come back home, and who are keen to put on that blue jersey and represent their state, yeah, it gives good vibes around the group,\u201d Fainga\u2019a said. Loading Though a successful former Brumbies coach, McKellar has been at pains to say since taking over the Tahs last year that he doesn\u2019t want to transplant the Canberra club\u2019s style and culture. But there are definitely signs of some Brumbies\u2019 DNA being spliced in. The Brumbies built their identity on being the discards of NSW, and the hunger that came with it. McKellar has strategically sought to repatriate lost Tahs - many of them from the Brumbies. He also signed Warringah\u2019s Test flanker Luke Reimer for next year, too. \u201cWe want to be a club, an organisation - there\u2019s no shortage of talent in New South Wales - where we retain and develop our best young players,\u201d McKellar said.",

        "text": "The delay of an early intervention program for children linked to National Disability Insurance Scheme costs isn't a mark of uncertainty, Anthony Albanese insists.\n\nState and territory leaders have agreed to help limit annual growth of the NDIS to six per cent in exchange for an extra $25 billion in Commonwealth funding for public hospitals over the next five years.\n\nHowever, a program to move children with mild to moderate levels of autism off the NDIS and into state-based programs has been delayed by several months to give jurisdictions more time to adjust to changes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe $2 billion Thriving Kids program was due to begin in July but will now start in October and be fully implemented by early 2028, the prime minister said on Friday.\n\nAnthony Albanese has agreed to the states' request to delay the Thriving Kids scheme. (Bianca De Marchi/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"The states put to us the possibility of a short delay in the full implementation of Thriving Kids,\" he said in Sydney.\n\n\"We agreed that proposal was reasonable, that we get this right, and so it is a positive move.\"\n\nPressed on Saturday morning over whether the delay would add to uncertainty about the program, Mr Albanese rebuffed the suggestion.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" he told reporters in Adelaide.\n\n\"We're making sure we get it right. It'll be rolled out from this year and we'll be fully rolled out, fully implemented, on the 1st of January 2028.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"That's what good governments do. Good governments get the detail right.\"\n\nThe states say they will increase their share of contributions for the NDIS. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nState leaders had previously said they were blindsided by NDIS Minister Mark Butler's announcement of the Thriving Kids scheme in 2025 during a speech at the National Press Club.\n\nOpposition health spokeswoman Anne Ruston said the delay to Thriving Kids was concerning.\n\n\"Young Australians living with a disability and their families remain in ongoing uncertainty due to the complete lack of clarity and detail around the new Thriving Kids program,\" she said.\n\nACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said jurisdictions would increase their share of contributions for the NDIS over the next five years.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Two billion dollars will be matched to deliver Thriving Kids as the first phase of foundational supports, with the Commonwealth providing $1.4 billion of its contribution to support states,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Barr says the states and territories will increase their share of contributions for the NDIS. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nDespite the extra $25 billion secured by the states in return for their co-operation on NDIS spending, Doctors Reform Society president Tim Woodruff said public hospital patients would keep languishing on wait lists.\n\n\"It's all about smoke and mirrors,\" he said on Saturday.\n\n\"Of course it's a record spend. Any new spending will be a record because our population is growing, it is ageing and demand is increasing.\n\n\"What we really want to know is whether this new spending increases the federal contribution up towards the 50 per cent level it was set at decades ago.\"",
