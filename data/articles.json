Try to lower yourself by crossing one foot in front of the other, and lower yourself.\n\nOne point is subtracted for each support used, such as a hand, forearm or knee.\n\nIf one hand is placed on the knee for support, it counts as a support; deduct one point.\n\nHalf a point (0.5) is subtracted if the action is as unsteady, indicating a partial loss of balance.\n\nA score of 0 is given if the person is not able to sit from the floor without external assistance (like using a table or wall to sit and stand, or with another person's help).\n\nOnce on the floor, begin the standing action.

        "text": "In the early 1950s, Iran had a liberal prime minister who was nurturing a delicate and imperfect democracy, and who believed the nation should stop shipping the country's resource riches offshore.\n\nMohammad Mossadegh wanted to take the wealth buried in Iran's oil fields and invest it into the country and its people.\n\nThe parliament that elected him had also passed his flagship legislation, but locking United States and British interests out of the Iranian oil industry was not going to work for the West.\n\nWhen Mossadegh nationalised Iran's oil industry, he achieved one of his greatest ambitions, but he also set in motion his eventual downfall.\n\nThe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company started drilling Iranian fields early in the 20th century and had made its British owners a fortune. That company would later become British Petroleum, now known as BP.\n\nThe oil extracted from Iran was largely buying the standard of living enjoyed by Britons, and Mossadegh wanted to change that.\n\nThe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company became British Petroleum, now known as BP. (File)\n\nIn a now-declassified CIA document, the agency said Mossadegh was \"one of the most mercurial, maddening, adroit, and provocative leaders\" American and British officials had ever encountered.\n\nHis agenda put a target on his back, and he soon became the focus of a covert intelligence operation said to have been hatched in the bowels of the US embassy in Tehran.\n\nThe Western powers were orchestrating an uprising against him and planned to install a replacement who would be much more friendly to their oil interests.\n\nIn that same declassified document, the CIA admits to Operation Ajax and that it \"had a hand\" in the demonstrations that spilled onto the streets of Tehran.\n\nMI6 has been much less forthcoming with any admissions, but it is widely understood that British agents were involved in inciting the protests.\n\nWhile that was happening, the US applied pressure to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi \u2014 the man history now records as the last monarch of Iran.\n\nThey wanted him to sign the royal decrees to sanction the change of government.\n\n\"The shah \u2026 kept on telling the Americans and the British that he couldn't go against oil nationalisation and Mossadegh, because if he did that, he would lose all credibility, he would destroy his monarchy, his throne,\" said Ervand Abrahamian, emeritus professor of history and middle eastern studies at CUNY Graduate University in New York.\n\n\"The final threat that the Americans gave him was, 'We're going to go with the coup. If you don't come with us, one of your brothers will replace you'.\n\n\"So it's a mafia type of argument, and it was at that point, basically, he gave in, but knowing that he was actually undermining the monarchy.\"\n\nMassive protests broke out in Iran as prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh was overthrown in a coup. (Getty)\n\nOn August 15, 1953, the pressure applied by Western powers reached critical mass, and Mossadegh was removed from power.\n\nThe streets of Tehran were flooded with those involved in the uprising, but his supporters too, in clashes that killed more than 300 people.\n\n\"From then on, people said, if you have freedom and these openings, [a] parliamentary system, it's easy for foreigners to basically use the system to overthrow governments,\" Dr Abrahamian said.\n\nThe public knew there was neither an independent government nor a loyal monarch, and what was left was a \"vacuum of legitimacy\" \u2014 one that would eventually be filled by revolution and clerical rule.\n\nIn the decades that followed the 1953 coup, Iran developed nuclear capacity, and as the battle for supremacy inside the country continued, that program was growing in size and sophistication.\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi (second from left) and Farah Diba (second from right) attend a dinner given in their honour by US president John F Kennedy in 1962. (AFP)\n\nThis week, as Donald Trump repeated his line that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon, he made a threat, saying the US knows where the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is hiding.\n\nAs Mr Trump weighed up his decision to strike Iran, he said, \"I might do it, I might not\", but early on Saturday morning, local time in Iran, the world learned of his decision to proceed as American bombs fell on Iran.\n\nThe world waits to hear about any ambitions the US has in regards to the regime, but while history shows that a regime can change, Iran's \"red line\" on its nuclear program is unlikely to do the same.\n\nIran's last monarchy\n\nThe Shah of Iran Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, his wife Farah Diba, and their son Prince Reza Pahlavi, enjoyed close relations with the United States. ((Photo by michael norcia/Sygma via Getty Images))\n\nOnce Mossadegh was gone, the nationalisation of the oil industry was reversed and the shah allowed a deal between multinational oil giants.\n\nMossadegh had tried to stand up to the British empire over oil, and that made him wildly popular. Some of that support had waned by 1953, but his ousting was a defining moment for Iran.\n\n\"That was a moment of deep disappointment and disillusionment for this kind of young, idealistic generation of Iranian liberals, of 1950s modern middle-class Iran,\" said John Ghazvinian, historian and author of America and Iran: A History from 1720 to the Present.\n\n\" They never forgave the United States for it. \"\n\nThe shah, of course, stood to benefit from being the power centre in the nation and a friend of the West.\n\nThe Islamic revolution in Iran grew as various sections of society rose up against the shah. (AP Photo: File)\n\nExperts agree there had been no love lost between the shah and Mossadegh, and now the monarch was both reaping the benefit of his move against the nationalist, but also sowing the seeds for the revolution that was to come.\n\n\"The shah was never a huge fan of Mossadegh. The shah was a notoriously insecure person, didn't like prime ministers who were seen as more powerful than himself or more competent than himself,\" Mr Ghazvinian said.\n\nBut as the shah had predicted, while the global oil industry may have recovered, his standing among his subjects did not.\n\nDr Abrahamian said the shah was now seen as a \"puppet\" and any hopes for the fledgling Iranian democracy were extinguished.\n\n\"It wasn't a perfect democracy, but there was an open system. That ended after 1953,\" he said.\n\n\" The monarch was seen as now a puppet of foreign powers, but I think even more seriously, he undermined the constitution. \"\n\nThe shah would rule over Iran for almost another three decades, and it is during this period that Iran's nuclear program began.\n\nThe shah and US president Dwight Eisenhower signed a nuclear cooperation agreement, a research centre was established at Tehran University, and when the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was opened for signatures in 1968, Iran signed on the very first day.\n\nThe relationship between the United States and the shah was good, and so Iran was brought into the nuclear fold with the promise of \"Atoms for Peace\".\n\nBut the promises made when the US had its man safely tucked inside the grounds of the sprawling Iranian royal estate would end up needing to be kept by a hardline Islamic regime.\n\nIt is believed millions of people participated in anti-shah protests before the 1979 revolution. (AFP)\n\nReligious cleric and Islamic leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had been living in exile in Iraq and France, and he had been making some promises of his own.\n\nDr Abrahamian said that with a vacuum of legitimate leadership in Iran, Khomeini started to offer himself up.\n\n\"A guy comes along and says, 'It doesn't matter what was done in the past. I speak for God, or I speak for history, or I speak for providence.' His argument was Islam has the solution, Islam will solve all the problems,\" he said.\n\n\"He actually quite cleverly, very Machiavellianly, said he didn't want to create a new autocracy or a new clerical state \u2014 he wanted pure democracy, everyone would have the rights, there would be respect.\n\n\"He gave all basically the right lines to both the country and to the public. He had a plan for a clerical state, but he never revealed that.\"\n\nThe 1979 revolution\n\nThe shah tried to salvage his reputation domestically, but many Iranians still held a grudge against the United States, and he couldn't distance himself from Washington \u2014 it was his ticket out of town should he need it.\n\nIn the lead up to the 1979 revolution, students at Tehran University protested against the rule of the shah. (AP Photo: Bernhard Frye, File)\n\nMr Ghazvinian said by 1979, Iranian society was fractured and \"the centre couldn't hold\".\n\n\"The centrist liberal nationalists hated the shah because he was a dictator. The Marxists hated him because he was a bourgeois, pro-Western leader. The religious radicals hated him because his rule was seen as very decadent and sinful and not very Islamic and overly pro-Western,\" he said.\n\n\"What made it worse was that all three of those groups had their own reasons to either dislike or be suspicious of, or actually overtly hate, the United States.\n\n\"They put a stop to Iran's democratic transition, and they were still angry about that.\"\n\nIn December 1978, it is estimated that 2 million people participated in anti-shah protests, and by January 16, the shah and his family took that flight out of Iran, never to return.\n\nThe shah's son, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, lives in exile in Washington, DC, to this day.\n\nOn January 16, 1979 Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Empress Farah walked the tarmac at Mehrabad Airport in Tehran, boarded the plane and left the country for the last time. (AP Photo: File)\n\nAt the time, the Washington Post reported that the imperial family, including 63 princes and princesses, fled Iran and were sustained by wealth stashed away in foreign bank accounts.\n\nOn February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini descended from a chartered Air France Boeing 747, and the revolution took hold.\n\nKhomeini and his successor, Iran's current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the nation and its 90 million people into the depths of a hardline, authoritarian regime.\n\nThe Islamic Republic, founded by Ayatollah Khomeini nearly 50 years ago, is now very hard to know.\n\nWomen send us voice notes from inside the Iranian rebellion Photo shows An illustration shows women holding head scarves and standing in a scene with tear gas. Fearing for their lives, but resolute in their cause, the women and girls of Iran send voice notes to the world.\n\nWhile military leaders want to know every detail of Iran's nuclear capacity, humanitarian organisations struggle to document what they believe to be human rights violations being committed against Iranians, particularly women and girls.\n\nThe UN has found there to be a \"violent repression of peaceful protests and pervasive institutional discrimination against women and girls\" in Iran.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Iran could manufacture a nuclear bomb within weeks, but that contradicts what US intelligence said just months ago; nuclear experts say it would likely take much longer.\n\nIran denies it is attempting to build a nuclear weapon.\n\nAs world leaders and intelligence experts contemplate whether this moment is another defining one in Iran's history of leadership struggles, experts warn that a change of regime might not deliver a shift in nuclear policy or current sentiments towards the West.\n\nAfter Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran from exile in 1979, he was met with cheers and support. (Getty: Michel Setboun)\n\nThe potential for regime change\n\nIn the 1950s, Mossadegh was willing to pay the ultimate price for his nationalisation dream \u2014 for the right of a sovereign nation to be the one to profit from its resources.\n\nMr Ghazvinian said the current regime had the same absolute beliefs about its nuclear program, in particular about enrichment.\n\n\"They see it the same way. It's a national right, and it's simply not something that can be compromised on,\" he said.\n\n\"When Donald Trump says zero enrichment, that's a complete non-starter for Iran, because that is asking Iran to be held to a standard that \u2026 no country that's a member of the NPT is held to. Countries that belong to the NPT have the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. Now the problem becomes, is Iran doing this for peaceful purpose or not?\"\n\nRegime change is unlikely to bring democracy to Iran. A more threatening force could fill the vacuum Photo shows A bearded man in a turban and glasses speaks into a microphone in front of the Iranian flag. It's no secret Israel has wanted to see the current government of Iran fall for some time, as have many government officials in the US.\n\nMr Ghazvinian said a regime change was unlikely to shift that position because between the \"reformists or moderates or pragmatists or hardliners, there is not a lot of daylight between them in terms of the actual red lines on Iran's nuclear program\".\n\nHe said the likely only way the country would change its position was if it were plunged into political chaos.\n\n\"If you instigate regime change and it's replaced either by such an extraordinarily chaotic situation or a civil war, or it's replaced by a regime that is extremely compliant, that is literally a puppet regime of the West, which seems like an unlikely outcome,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Thomas, a lecturer in Middle East studies at Deakin University, said in a piece for The Conversation that any new political leadership being more friendly to Israel and the West was not a foregone conclusion.\n\nMr Ghazvinian said:",

Then a company from Corowa got wind of it, hopped in a plane, hired a car, came out to the farm and crawled all over it, took photos and said, 'Thanks very much Mac', and I have never heard from them since,\" he laughed.\n\n\" They turned my idea into a business, and made a fortune! \"\n\nMr McLeod's machine purifies about 15L of oil per hour. (ABC South East SA: Liz Rymill)\n\nChallenges bring opportunity\n\nOver his many years on the land, Mr McLeod has bought broken-down, second-hand and wrecked tractors and headers \"for $25 or so\" and rebuilt and redesigned them to create exactly the machinery he required for growing his crops.\n\n\"We harvested our first crop of sunflowers with a $25 header that I rebuilt,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I built a windrower, joined two old, wrecked tractors together; made a grain dryer for our maize crop, built weigh scales \u2026 I always looked for opportunities to mechanise and become more efficient.\"\n\nAs the seasons change in the south-east, and Glenroy's flood-plain past is met with a two-year drought, the McLeods reflect on a long life on the land.\n\n\"We just live quietly out here in our little nest. We're not part of the social set,\" Mrs McLeod said.\n\n\"We've faced some tough times and plenty of good times,\" Mr McLeod agreed.\n\n\"When things go wrong, that's an opportunity to find a way around it.\n\n\"When things go smoothly, I get bored.\"",

A few balls after that, with wickets starting to tumble, he shouldered arms to Josh Tongue only to be given out LBW, before reviewing a ball that would have smashed the top of middle stump.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nOut for 134, his was the third wicket in an Indian collapse of 7-41 that left the tourists all out for 471 and reduced their dominance after they had punished Ben Stokes's decision to send them in to bat.\n\nIndia batting coach Sitanshu Kotak defended Rishabh's approach.\n\n\"Rishabh Pant makes his own plans. He decides and he bats,\" Kotak said.\n\n\"This innings was different. Because he plays aggressive doesn't mean he can't play defence.\"\n\nEngland responded well to India's big first innings and the opening-over loss of Zak Crawley (4), with Ollie Pope unbeaten on 100 to end the day as he and Ben Duckett (62) led the team to 3-209 at stumps.\n\nPope will resume alongside Harry Brook, who is yet to score after coming in following the wicket of Joe Root (28) just before stumps.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "People operating nature refuges that play a pivotal role in the Queensland government's conservation goals say having to pay land tax is \"dumb\", and a disincentive to others wanting to protect habitats on their property.\n\nNature refuges, also known as conservation covenants, are deals struck between the state government and landholders to protect their land in perpetuity.\n\nThere are 592 such refuges around Queensland, protecting 4,930,731 hectares of important habitat.\n\nState land tax is applied to the accumulative property owned by an individual worth $600,000 or more, unless it is your home or subject to an exemption.\n\nCharities and primary producers, who run a great deal of the state's refuges, already receive a land tax exemption, but Queensland is the last state charging private landholders with refuges.\n\nThe Herbertvale nature refuge, operated by a grazier, covers close to 30,000 hectares of land about 260 kilometres north-west of Mount Isa. (Supplied: Queensland Government)\n\nPremier David Crisafulli last month flagged an ambition to rapidly expand protected areas in the state, with a focus on nature refuges.\n\nAbout 8.6 per cent of state has been protected, making the government about 14 million hectares short of its goal to protect 17 per cent of the state's land.\n\nA statement from the the Department of Environment, Science and Tourism said nature refuges \"play a critical role in conserving biodiversity, safeguarding habitats, and enhancing ecological connectivity across landscapes\".\n\nThe federal government has set its own goal of preserving 30 per cent of the country by 2030.\n\nLand tax a 'con' for refuges\n\nAndrew Taylor operates a nature refuge west of Brisbane, adjacent to the D'Aguilar National Park, with his partner Gabby.\n\nHe said it was a \"pristine\" block that had never been farmed or cleared, which created a corridor between two parts of the national park.\n\nIn order to prove the block's worthiness, Mr Taylor said he had to engage a third-party consultant at the cost of about $13,000 to assess the values of the property.\n\n\"They identified that it was habitat for the black-breasted button quail, for scrub turpentine, and a few other species which are listed as vulnerable or endangered.\"\n\nAndrew Taylor believes people who operate nature refuges should not have to pay land tax. (Supplied)\n\nMr Taylor said they paid around $3,500 in land tax every year \u2014 a price he believes will \"inevitably rise\".\n\nThe total cost of converting land to a nature refuge and the ongoing management can be a \"disincentive\" to people considering the taking the step, he added.\n\nWhile some councils offer support and rate relief for nature refuges, Somerset Regional Council, where Mr Taylor's property is located, does not.\n\nMr Taylor said he had received a state grant of $25,000 in 2023 to help eliminate the invasive weed cat's claw, which paid for three workers for a week on the property.\n\n\"I think people weigh up the financial pros and cons of converting a property and one of those financial disincentives is having to aggregate that land for the purposes of determining the threshold for land tax,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Taylor received a grant to remove the invasive weed cat's claw from a section of the property. (Supplied)\n\n'A cheaper lever to pull'\n\nThe ABC understands the Queensland government is considering a submission from the Australian Land Conservation Alliance (ALCA) for the exemption to be expanded to private land holders.\n\nALCA policy lead Michael Cornish said because of existing exemptions, the change would come at a \"low and reasonable cost\" to the government.\n\n\"We're not talking about millions of dollars here,\" he said.\n\n\"For governments who might try to fund the entirety of their conservationist project themselves, it's a much cheaper lever to pull.\"\n\nIn research published earlier this year, Griffith University conservation planning expert Dr Michelle Ward found half of the habitat of 220 \"highly imperilled\" species fell outside of currently protected areas.\n\nDr Michelle Ward setting a wildlife detection camera following bushfires in 2019-2020. (Supplied)\n\nDr Ward was encouraged by the Queensland government's focus on nature refuges, and said a land tax exemption would be a \"great first step and incentive\" to encourage landholders.\n\n\"These landholders need to be adequately paid for taking land out of production and maintaining it as natural vegetation as well as managing the land,\" she said.\n\n\"Conservation actions are not cheap \u2026 it's not just a single point in time that it needs to happen, it needs to happen over many years.\"\n\nQld has no timeline for key environmental goal Photo shows A shimmering flood plain with a mountain in the background. There are calls for the state government to set a concrete timeline for its target of preserving 17 per cent of its landmass, with just 595,000 hectares protected since 2022.\n\nIn 2024, Victoria became the most recent state to introduce a similar exemption to what is being called for in Queensland.\n\nThe change caused a surge of interest in nature refuges, according to Trust for Nature, an organisation that helps landholders through the process of converting their land.\n\n\"In the past year we've had a record number of 53 covenants registered and 168 are currently in progress,\" Trust for Nature Victoria chief executive Corinne Proske said.\n\nTrust for Nature Victoria CEO Corinne Proske says Victoria cutting the tax led to widespread interest in nature refuges. (Supplied)\n\nMuch of this interest has come in areas around Melbourne with high land tax, such as the Mornington Peninsula, Ms Proske said.\n\n\" We are seeing some people who are conservation-minded and financially savvy, particularly with some of these properties with a high land tax. \"\n\nShe said areas with high developmental value were often those that needed the most protection.\n\nQueensland property owners tend to pay far less in land tax than in Victoria, but Mr Cornish from ALCA said an exemption for nature refuges would be a good opportunity for the government to \"put their money where their mouth is\".\n\n'It's still dumb'\n\nOn the Sunshine Coast, Deon Venter and his wife Jane have converted 32 hectares of a 35 hectare block to a nature refuge.\n\nMany of the blocks around it have been developed, and the property provides part of a nature corridor directly into Tewantin National Park.\n\n\"The amount of diversity is stunning, at both the botanical and animal level. Every time you walk through it you notice something new,\" Mr Venter said.\n\nRe-rehabilitated bandicoots on Deon Venter's Sunshine Coast property.

(ABC Gold Coast: Tom Forbes)\n\nWal Mayr, who runs a 25 hectare nature refuge in the Gold Coast hinterland with his wife Heather, said they were lucky to receive support from the council and state grants, outweighing the few thousand they pay in land tax.\n\nBut it still rubbed him the wrong way.",

She would bark, she would whimper, she would cry. She sometimes wouldn't toilet,\" Dr Lee said.\n\n\"When we went overseas recently, for the first time in her life, she escaped the yard because there was a dog sitter with her and not our family.\"\n\nVeterinarian Amy Lee thinks her rescue Mabel is \"the best dog in the world\". (Supplied: Dr Amy Lee)\n\nNow, Mabel is one of many dogs on a medication called fluoxetine \u2014 a type of antidepressant sold under the brand name Prozac.\n\nFor Dr Lee, being able to prescribe fluoxetine for dogs like hers has been \"a godsend\".\n\n\" Without medication, Mabel would just not be able to cope. \"\n\nLoading...\n\nWhile Dr Lee is comfortable with providing anxiety medicines to dogs like Mabel at her clinic in Blacktown, NSW, she said it wasn't suitable for every animal.\n\nDr Lee takes dog owners through one-hour long consultations about their pet's history and behaviours before deciding whether to prescribe medication.\n\nBut this isn't standard across the veterinarian sector, with some vets only getting a 15-minute appointment to make the decision.\n\nThis is creating concerns from some in the industry about how many dogs are going onto anti-anxiety medication as a first-line treatment.\n\nTen-fold rise in behavioural problems\n\nA study looking at millions of canine medical records in the US from 2010 to 2020 found a 10-fold increase in behavioural problems, and an increase in antidepressant medications.\n\nDr Lee says she's seen an increase in dogs at her clinic with behavioural issues like aggression, separation anxiety as well as problematic behaviours.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like almost every second dog that walks through the door has some sort of behavioural concern,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Australia-wide data on use of drug therapies for animals is not recorded by groups like the Australian Veterinary Association, there is evidence that their use is on the rise.\n\nAustralian pet pharmacy YourPetPA listed fluoxetine on its website as its third \"best selling\" prescription medication.\n\nBut Paul McGreevy, a veterinarian and a researcher of animal behaviour at the University of Sydney, said the real issue for the dogs was the management by their owners.\n\n\"The danger is that pet owners demand a medication to resolve a problem, when the problem is actually them,\" he said.\n\nPuppy school can be helpful, but behavioural veterinarian Michelle Rassool says it's not enough. (Flickr: Puppy School/Halans/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\n\nDogs, he noted, have different needs and wants to humans, which we struggle to respond to, and instead, we \"expect the dogs to adapt to our way of life\".\n\n\"If you want a dog, expect it to do doggy things, and expect it to have doggy needs,\" Professor McGreevy said.\n\nPuppy school alone won't 'cut the mustard'\n\nMichelle Rassool, a behavioural veterinarian who works in both general practice and a behavioural clinic, said many owners were at their wits end with their dog's behaviour when they came to her.\n\n\"The average person gets a dog to have a friend, and they are normally not skilled in behaviour modification,\" she said.\n\n\"People should be aware that there are multiple options for intervening in behaviour.\n\n\" In my hands, medication is rarely the first intervention, and it should never be prescribed on its own. \"\n\nInstead, Dr Rassool suggested positive behavioural training, changes to the environment, and changes to what the owners expect from their dog could all help create a better dog-owner relationship.\n\n\"Is the dog getting enough exercise? Are they fulfilled?\n\n\"If we've got a dog that's worried about being left alone, we don't just give medication and leave it alone.\n\n\"Our goals are always to use medication to leverage change and then look at weaning off or reducing where we can.\"\n\n'Vulnerable' dog breeds are dying out Photo shows A white and black dog with long hair over it's eyes.

(ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nDr Lee noted that using positive reinforcement, rather than negative, was also extremely important to ensure the behaviour didn't become worse.\n\n\"If you've got a dog and you use either a combination of punishment and positive [reinforcement], or if you use just punishment, you're actually more likely to end up with aggression in your dog,\" she said.\n\n\"[Negative reinforcement] will work for a while because the dog doesn't want to be punished, but because they're not solving the underlying emotions it will eventually make the behaviour worse.\"\n\nAvoiding the kennel\n\nGetting the balance right between appropriate training and medication can be life or death for dogs.\n\n\"Behaviour problems are the biggest killer of young dogs,\" Professor McGreevy said.\n\n\" Under three years of age, it's behaviour problems that get them killed \u2014 either on roads or more commonly by euthanasia, because they're not fitting into our world. \"\n\n\"Is that because they're they are not medicated correctly?

        "text": "Why are people turning away from mainstream media and seeking alternative sources of news?\n\nLast week, the University of Canberra released its annual survey of trust in the media, which made fascinating reading.\n\nAmong its results, it found Australians' concern about misinformation was the highest globally.\n\nIt said Australia \"urgently needed\" a national media and digital literacy campaign to help news consumers feel confident about their ability to spot misinformation.\n\nBut what would that campaign look like?\n\nLet's take a very quick look at the news-gathering model, think about what makes stories \"true\", and consider some of the pressures journalists face to stop them telling certain stories.\n\nIt's a huge topic, but it's necessary to talk about.\n\nA basic model for news\n\nJournalists are taught that news stories should contain the \"Five Ws\":\n\nIf a news outlet covers an event, its coverage should contain those basic elements.\n\nWho is this story about? What has happened? Where did it happen? When did it happen? Why did it happen? (And why is it important?)\n\nThe first four Ws can be simple enough.\n\nThey're the building blocks for basic stories like this: There is a huge flood (what) in outback Queensland (where) right now (when) and more than 100,000 head of livestock are estimated to be dead or lost (who).\n\nThe last W in the model \u2014 Why \u2014 can be more complicated, because that's how you apply \"meaning\" to an event.\n\nWhy has something happened? Why is it important?\n\nBecause we're human, the interpretation of events can be hotly contested and lead to accusations of bias and everything else.\n\nBut according to the way it works in theory, journalists are trained to gather the facts and seek expert opinion to help them make sense of the facts, to tell us what they mean.\n\nWhen you put those elements together, you'll hopefully have a decent story.\n\nWhat kind of stories are they?\n\nNow, that's an oversimplified description of the way the news-gathering model works in reality.\n\nThe conceptual boundaries between the Five Ws aren't always clear-cut. There's a lot of interplay between them.\n\nFor example, depending on the type of story you're covering, you might need an expert's help to know what the facts of certain phenomena are before you can even start writing about them (re: the science of climate change).\n\nBut you get the gist.\n\nIsrael is trying to remake the Middle East Photo shows Benjamin Netanyahu holds up his right hand. There are many things happening in the Middle East at the moment but beneath them lies one single through-line: Israel is attempting to reshape the political map of the region.\n\nIf you wanted to teach someone how news was generated, you'd start with a bare-bones, idealised model like that.\n\nThen you'd take the next step.\n\nYou'd say we always need to remember that they're just stories, at the end of the day. They're trying to turn the chaos and confusion of reality into a comprehensible \"story\" that helps the human brain to make sense of a very complex world.\n\nAnd what sets the media's stories apart from other kinds of stories (such as fairytales, or novels, or films) is they're supposed to be \"true\", or an honest attempt to \"tell the truth\" about reality.\n\nThat's the implied social compact.\n\nAnd given that assumption about the media's stories, people who consume \"the news\" are more willing to let the media's stories shape their perception of the world in ways they wouldn't dare allow for other kinds of stories (like fairytales).\n\nSo, cognitively, readers let their guard down a little. And that makes the media's stories uniquely potent.\n\nIt's why there's a global multi-billion-dollar industry dedicated to capturing, controlling, and confusing the \"trusted stories\" the media tells every day.\n\nOr better still, stopping the media from telling certain stories at all, by harassing, intimidating, and killing journalists in their hundreds.\n\nIf the powerful can dictate terms, they'll destroy your stories\n\nIs everyone in the media industry a good person pursuing a noble cause?\n\nOf course not. It's like any industry.\n\nIf you work in the media long enough, it's unsurprising to learn that the \"father of apartheid\" in South Africa, Hendrik Verwoerd, was a former newspaper editor.\n\nThe dark history of Harmony Day Photo shows A group of people standing around caskets remembering victims March 21 is known around the world as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a solemn reminder of a brutal massacre that took place on this day more than 60 years ago. In Australia, it's called Harmony Day.\n\nSome media companies behave like the media-arm of their preferred political party, do hit jobs on their enemies, and always seem ready to manufacture consent for the next war.\n\nThat's been the reality of the industry for hundreds of years. Who owns the world's media companies?\n\nBut there are plenty of journalists and editors that really try to tell the truth. In independent media and the legacy media. They appreciate that they have to keep demonstrating to their readers that their stories can be trusted.\n\nThey know if readers start to notice that their stories are omitting crucial facts, including basic facts of history and law, while downplaying some voices and elevating others, their readers will lose trust in their ability to tell truthful stories.\n\nAnd that would be dire for their news outlet.\n\nThey know if they allow the powerful to dictate how stories are told, they'll be allowing the powerful to kill their stories and their audience.\n\nSo they really try to stop bad-faith actors from confusing their Five Ws with waves of misinformation and intimidation:\n\nShould the media talk openly about the pressures it faces?\n\nWe're living in a dangerous moment in history.\n\nIn the last 12 months, arms and weapons manufacturers, and cyber intelligence and security companies linked to the global war machine, have been making extremely handsome profits.\n\nThe share price of Palantir Technologies has exploded by 447.57 per cent (to $US139.96) in the last year, and the value of Elbit Systems shares has surged 144 per cent (to $US438.47).\n\nAustralia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, is making multi-million-dollar returns from its investments in such companies.\n\nAs Europe rearms, where is Australia's Future Fund investing? Photo shows A row of cybertrucks As defence spending ramps up across Europe, Australia's Future Fund is investing in weapons manufacturers, Tesla and Palantir Technologies.\n\nGovernments, militaries, and different lobby groups are trying to stop people speaking up about the atrocities they're witnessing and the concerns they have about the future.\n\nHow should journalists report on these events?\n\nWhen it comes to media literacy, Australian audiences might be shocked to learn how difficult it is for the media to write about the world in plain language sometimes, given how strict defamation law is in this country (among other laws).\n\nThey might be shocked to learn about the orchestrated bullying that goes on, which is designed to discourage editors and journalists from reporting on certain topics and framing stories in certain ways, even speaking to certain people.\n\nWould it improve media literacy if the media wrote about these issues openly and regularly?\n\nOn lying and politics\n\nDo we want the media to speak matter-of-factly about propaganda too?\n\nEvery military engages in it, including the Australian Defence Force. Governments and lobby groups engage in it.\n\nThey use different propaganda strategies for different audiences (whether domestic or foreign), and apply different tactics to try to control the media narrative at different times.\n\nConsider Australia's public relations efforts in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nAustralia may have bugged Timor-Leste political leaders in 2000 Photo shows Alexander Downer and Indonesian president BJ Habibie Documents filed in court claim that Australia may have been monitoring the phone calls of political leaders in Timor-Leste in 2000.\n\nOur government is spending a lot of diplomatic effort cultivating relationships with our island neighbours and encouraging their people to come to work in Australia on special working visas.\n\nIt would like them to think Australia is a trustworthy ally, one they can trust more than other countries in the region.\n\nBut one wonders what the people of Timor-Leste think about that.\n\nHave a read of Hannah Arendt's famous essay from 1971, on the Pentagon Papers, where she expressed amazement at the degree to which the United States government deliberately lied to its citizens about the reality of the Vietnam War, and about its reasons for invading and bombing Vietnam.\n\nOr have a read of the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe's most recent book, Lobbying for Zionism on both sides of the Atlantic, which goes into great detail explaining the tactics used by pro-Israel lobbies in the US and UK, including their campaigns against the BBC and the Guardian, and their campaign to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming Britain's prime minister.\n\nThe former Israeli minister Shumalit Aloni, in an interview in the United States in 2002, stated plainly that pro-Israel lobbies used accusations of antisemitism to stifle criticism of Israel.\n\n\"Well it's a trick we always use. When in Europe somebody is criticising Israel, then we bring up the Holocaust. When in this country people are criticising well, then they are antisemitic,\" she said.\n\nThese are all things the media has to navigate.\n\nWhat do we want from reporters?\n\nIn last week's media survey, respondents said they wanted journalists \"to be more courageous and ask tough questions\".\n\nThey wanted the media to \"report the facts\" and \"tell the truth\".\n\nBut let's raise some adjacent issues.\n\n\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d: 75 years on, George Orwell\u2019s prophecy is as powerful as ever The anniversary of the publication of George Orwell\u2019s greatest novel is an opportunity to recognise literature\u2019s capacity to provoke and instruct, and to inspire independent thought and action.\n\nDo we want journalists to have morals? Do we want their work to be guided by their morals and ethics? Do we want them to speak up about the injustice they see around them, or do we want them to stay quiet? Is it courageous to sit in silence?\n\nGeorge Orwell is considered one of the greatest journalists and writers of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1940, he wrote a book review of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.\n\nIn his review, he was scornful of the British elite for their earlier support for Hitler.\n\nHe was objective. He said he understood Hitler's charismatic appeal and he could see that Fascism and Nazism were tapping into something primal in the human brain.\n\nHe also shared a personal opinion about Hitler: \"I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him.\"\n\nWas that OK for a journalist to write that he would like to murder a public figure? It would probably be difficult to find many people who'd have a problem with that opinion of his, given he was talking about Hitler.\n\nBut what did it mean for Orwell's journalism?\n\nOne might argue that it showed it was possible to write with objectivity while feeling a deep moral disgust at the same time.\n\nAren't all journalists activists?\n\nLet's wrap things up with a final question.\n\nSometimes you'll hear people saying journalists shouldn't be activists. But what they're really saying is:\n\n\"Journalists shouldn't be regularly writing and talking about the issues I don't want them to be talking about, but I'm happy for them to campaign on the issues I personally think are important.\"\n\nAll journalists are activists, in a sense.\n\nAn editorial decision to run a story (or ignore a story) is based on multiple decisions, but many of those decisions relate to what they think is important.\n\nBut \"important\" is a dangerous word.\n\nWhy? Because it's impossible to define the word \"important\" without referencing human judgement. If you say something's important, it begs the question: important to who?\n\nAt the moment, some of Australia's major news organisations are reporting very critically on the Albanese government's superannuation plan. There's an obvious media campaign going on.\n\nWhat's motivating the campaign? Why isn't that considered a form of activism?\n\nIf we embarked on a national campaign to improve media literacy in this country, it would be fascinating to see how these topics were tackled.",

        "text": "When Michael Farrelly stepped out onto a Gold Coast street in late 2016, wearing a jumper plastered in oversized Chanel logos, an ABC TV crew was waiting for him.\n\nAs he walked to a waiting convertible, the self-described \"serial entrepreneur\" dodged questions about charging patients as much as $44,000 for untested stem cell therapy with the promise it could treat everything from multiple sclerosis to cancer.\n\n\"Just wondering if you're aware that your company \u2026 has been referred to the Queensland Health Ombudsman for misleading and deceptive practices?\" the reporter asked him.\n\n\"You'll have to talk to my lawyer about that,\" he replied, before speeding off into the night.\n\nThe Queensland Health Ombudsman never took any action against Michael Farrelly, who'd been operating his stem cell business in that state under an alias, Mikael Wolfe.\n\nIt would be nearly a decade before Michael Farrelly came onto the ABC's radar again.\n\nWhen Background Briefing started looking into serious complaints about him last year, the businessman had undergone a makeover \u2014 he'd found a new product to spruik, moved to New South Wales and even taken up a new alias, Vergel Page.\n\nFor more stories like this follow the podcast Photo shows Background Briefing logo. Listen for free on ABC Listen on your mobile device.\n\nAs Vergel Page, he was selling testosterone online to men with the promise of making them feel like a \"million bucks\", giving them \"big coconut balls\" and sending their sex drive \"through the roof\".\n\nMany of his clients told us the reality of this treatment fell far short of his shiny sales pitch. Some were left thousands of dollars out of pocket, while others even experienced serious health impacts.\n\nBut now, almost a decade after he was first investigated by health authorities, Michael Farrelly has been permanently banned from the healthcare industry by the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC).\n\n'Little regard' for safety\n\nIn issuing the permanent ban this month, the HCCC found that in operating three online testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) clinics \u2014 Climax Clinic, Australian Institute of Sports Science and Peak Performance Clinic \u2014 Farrelly's conduct had \"posed a risk to public safety\".\n\nIt said that despite having no qualifications to do so, he'd made recommendations to his clients about medication, including telling one patient to double his testosterone dose \"against the instruction of the named prescriber\".\n\n\"A permanent prohibition order means Mr Farrelly is banned from providing any health service in any capacity in NSW, Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria,\" NSW Health Care Complaints Commissioner John Tansey told the ABC.\n\nTestosterone replacement therapy is marketed as a silver bullet that can increase libido, boost energy levels and help men stay active as they age. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\n\"Mr Farrelly showed little regard for client safety or the laws that regulate health services. The evidence confirmed he posed a serious and ongoing risk to the public, and his refusal to cooperate left the Commission with no option but to impose a permanent ban.\"\n\nThe HCCC regulates hundreds of thousands of practitioners in NSW and this is just the third permanent ban it has made this year.\n\nWhile the ban stops Farrelly from running a healthcare service, it appears there's nothing to stop him starting up another company in another industry.\n\nHe has also not been charged with any criminal offences.\n\n'I'm going to make you huge'\n\nTRT has exploded in popularity in recent years, spruiked to men by manosphere influencers including Joe Rogan. Many men are inundated with ads on social media, with clinics promising it's a cure-all for everything from flagging energy to low libido.\n\nFor one of Farrelly's former clients, retired builder Sam, the draw was the hope of alleviating the crippling pain of his osteoarthritis.\n\nAn online ad led him to contact one of Farrelly's online TRT clinics, the Australian Institute of Sports Science \u2014 mistakenly thinking it was associated with the Australian Institute of Sport \u2014 and he spoke to a man who called himself \"Vergel Page\".\n\nMichael Farrelly's lawyers admitted to the HCCC that Vergel Page was a \"sales pseudonym\" for Farrelly.\n\nMichael Farrelly went under the alias \"Mikael Wolfe\" when he was selling stem cell treatments a decade ago. (Supplied: Mikael Wolfe Facebook)\n\n\" He said, 'I'm going to make you huge,'\" Sam recalled. \"And I said, 'mate, I don't want to be huge. I want my pain to go away.' \"\n\nAfter a short phone consultation with a doctor, Sam paid $3,500 for a year's supply of TRT and ongoing care. But when his testosterone shot up to more than 10 times his original levels, neither Vergel Page nor the clinic would respond to him.\n\n\"I had no help,\" Sam says. \"Zero.\"\n\nSam created a Facebook group whose members uncovered Michael Farrelly's business history. (ABC News: Dean Faulkner)\n\nSam is just one of many former Farrelly clients who spoke to Background Briefing, recounting similar stories of paying thousands of dollars for TRT, only to be ghosted.\n\nJamie, 48, developed a chronic heart issue, atrial fibrillation, after starting on injectable testosterone prescribed by a Farrelly TRT business called the Climax Clinic.\n\nHe and others also received abusive messages from Farrelly after contacting him for a refund.\n\nThe search begins\n\nIn March last year, Farrelly put his TRT clinics into liquidation, saying there was no money left, and disappeared.\n\nSo Sam and some of his other clients started organising in a Facebook group to try and find him \u2014 to get their money back, and to get some answers.\n\nThey thought Farrelly was still operating in New South Wales, until one day Sam got an intriguing Facebook message: a tip that the TRT salesman, with his distinctive facial tattoos, had been spotted in a small, sleepy town in northern Tasmania.\n\nDo you know more? Contact backgroundbriefing@abc.net.au\n\nOr, send an encrypted email from a Protonmail account to backgroundbriefing@protonmail.com\n\nSend us documents anonymously through SecureDrop\n\nBackground Briefing found that property records showed a house in the Tasmanian town was purchased in late 2023 under Farrelly's mother's name.\n\nA liquidator's report also confirmed that a car at this property, a white Mercedes-Benz, was owned by Michael Farrelly. Eyewitnesses said the TRT salesman was living at the address, too.\n\nHCCC commissioner John Tansey told the ABC that Farrelly first came onto the regulator's radar in 2022, but his move interstate, while operating under multiple businesses and aliases, made its investigation very difficult.\n\nIn Australia, each state has its own individual health regulator. The national healthcare watchdog, AHPRA, currently only polices registered healthcare practitioners, such as doctors and nurses, and not unregistered practitioners like Farrelly.\n\nThe NSW HCCC's investigation into Farrelly stretched out for over a year, as investigators combed through business records and even got clinical records from the TRT clinics' software provider when, the HCCC said in its decision, Farrelly stopped cooperating.\n\nJamie was convinced to go on an injectable testosterone called Primoteston. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nCommissioner Tansey said the evidence collected during the HCCC's investigation confirmed Farrelly had facilitated the supply of prescription medication without having the qualification to do so, and that the commission was keeping an eye on him.\n\n\"Any breach of the order is a criminal offence and may result in prosecution,\" the commissioner said.\n\nWhile the HCCC is only the regulator for NSW, its ban on Farrelly is also enforced by Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.\n\nAnd in December last year, his new home base of Tasmania passed laws to recognise other states' healthcare prohibition orders, putting an end to the possibility of him being able to practise there too.\n\nWhere to from here?\n\nSam thinks more needs to be done to make TRT safe, including national regulation and stricter rules on who can open up these clinics.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of people on Facebook that will hate me because they don't want it regulated because they won't get their medication,\" he says. \"I just think the whole industry needs to be regulated.\"\n\nSam is now accessing TRT from a different source. He says his problem isn't with TRT, it's with unscrupulous providers like Michael Farrelly. (ABC News: Dean Faulkner)\n\nHe points to the fact that in January this year, while still under a temporary prohibition order from the HCCC over his existing TRT clinics, Michael Farrelly was able to open a new business that supplied testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nCompany records show that the business was registered at the Tasmanian address, where the HCCC's orders didn't apply, and Farrelly was named as its director. Its directorship was only transferred to someone else this week.\n\nThe ABC understands ASIC has not disqualified Farrelly from managing corporations.\n\nThe liquidator of Farrelly's TRT businesses has spent more than a year trying to trace more than $15 million of transactions that flowed in and out of the companies. He's expected to report to creditors within the month.",

Jamarra Ugle-Hagan has been absent from Western Bulldogs training for much of this year. Credit: Darrian Traynor \u201cWhen you are down, you want to keep finding an upper. My upper was probably staying and hanging out with my mates and getting on the piss and training with them as well,\u201d Ugle-Hagan said. \u201cBut it just had no end goal \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a game. I didn\u2019t have anything. My mental health wasn\u2019t in the right space, so I was struggling, and I found it really tough to even enjoy football. \u201cI lost the fun in it. I didn\u2019t want to play. It wasn\u2019t even a priority because all I wanted to do was find something, but I didn\u2019t know what that was until I had this break.\u201d\n\nUgle-Hagan said speaking at the retreat about his mental health challenges helped him realise that he was not alone. \u201cIt takes balls to talk in a group but once you do it, it is f---ing amazing. It feels good, and they have answers for you,\u201d he said. Jamarra Ugle-Hagan recreated Nicky Winmar\u2019s famous gesture by facing the crown and pointing to his skin in 2023. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYou think you are alone and no one understands, but when you speak up and hear people\u2019s stories, it makes you feel so much better ... knowing they\u2019re going through the same thing you are.\u201d Ugle-Hagan also explained his absence from the Bulldogs\u2019 centenary anniversary match this year \u2013 which the likes of David King and James Hird criticised him for \u2013 saying he had to talk his best friend from Warrnambool out of taking his own life.\n\nHe ended up inviting his friend to Melbourne and spending that weekend with him. Ugle-Hagan, who grew up on an Aboriginal township in Framlingham, near Warrnambool, said that was not the only time he confronted suicide, revealing that \u201cmultiple\u201d family members had taken their own lives. \u201cWe found our cousin in his room. I found my uncle, or my family found our uncle, in the gutter down the road from our house,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shit I have seen. I have seen a lot more than that as well.\u201d No.1 pick Jamarra Ugle-Hagan celebrates with family on draft night. Credit: Getty Images The young star also stated his focus was on proving himself at training \u2013 and not the potential of seeking a fresh start elsewhere, such as Sydney, who have been strongly linked to the 2020 No.1 draft pick.\n\nLoading \u201cI\u2019m obviously still contracted with the \u2018Doggies\u2019. I still want to play for them and win a flag,\u201d Ugle-Hagan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Bulldogs until my contract runs out, and then hopefully they offer me another one, but we will see how we go. They have given me opportunities since day dot, so why can\u2019t I get back?\u201d Experiencing everything that comes with competing at the highest level is driving Ugle-Hagan as he tries to convince coach Luke Beveridge and his teammates that he is ready to play again. \u201cI want to play footy. I can\u2019t wait to play footy,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading I want to kick a f---ing goal in front of those crowds. I have been watching every single Bulldogs game. I have been supporting them [and] watching them. I will go to games at the end of the year. \u201cI genuinely want to play one more [game]. I want to play some games. It\u2019s going to be grouse.\u201d Beveridge said this month that Ugle-Hagan was \u201cour player\u201d and they were committed to supporting him, while Ugle-Hagan said the club\u2019s chief executive, Ameet Bains, was like a \u201cbrother\u201d to him. \u201cI\u2019m good friends with the doctor and good mates with all the boys \u2013 there are different characters,\u201d Ugle-Hagan said. \u201cYou go in there, they look after you, and they genuinely love you in there.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Sitting in a hotel in 2023, Damson Idris had just landed the most important role of his life. Legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joe Kosinski, the team who took over the box office (OK, and the world) with Top Gun: Maverick, wanted Idris for their high-stakes Formula 1 blockbuster, F1. Idris would play Joshua Pearce, a young gun rookie modelled on Lewis Hamilton (also a producer on the film), and Brad Pitt would play his team-mate and rival, Sonny Hayes, a grizzled veteran who returns to the sport to partner Pearce on the fictional APXGP team. As far as big breaks go, they don\u2019t come much bigger than this. So you\u2019d imagine Idris\u2019 mind might be racing faster than the F1 car he didn\u2019t know how to drive (but would soon master). Damson Idris as Joshua Pearce and Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes in a scene from \u201cF1: The Movie.\u201d Credit: AP \u201cNot really,\u201d deadpans Idris, speaking to me from South Africa, where he is shooting his next film. \u201cI was just consumed by one thought: I need to be faster than Brad Pitt.\u201d Fast-forward a year or so, and after hundreds of hours on the practice circuit, seven months of training, more than a few crashes, several headaches, and roughly eight kilos lost purely from sweating on set, Idris learned a valuable lesson. \u201cBrad Pitt is annoyingly good at everything,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd I mean everything: acting, racing, even walking. The way he walks on screen is second to none.\u201d I mention that one of my favourite YouTube clips is a super cut of Brad Pitt eating in all his different films (it\u2019s called 15 Minutes of Brad Pitt Eating, and well worth a watch).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d says Idris. \u201cI attempted eating in one scene during F1, and they scrapped it, and you know what? Good on them. I\u2019m with the greatest on-screen eater of all time. Come on, man, what were you thinking?\u201d \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019 is a question I\u2019ve been meaning to ask director Joseph Kosinski. In 2022, he helped \u201csave cinema\u201d (Spielberg\u2019s words, not mine) with Top Gun: Maverick, a sweeping sequel to the 1986 original that was critically and commercially celebrated, grossing $1.496 billion worldwide at the box office. Such a feat warrants time off. A mini-break. Honestly, Joe, what were you thinking? \u201cWell, as with so many people, during the pandemic, I became obsessed with Drive to Survive on Netflix,\u201d says Kosinski. \u201cI went to school for mechanical engineering and aerospace, so the way these cars work is fascinating to me, and then factor in the personalities and team dynamics, it\u2019s rich with story.\u201d Pitt and Bruckheimer shared Kosinski\u2019s obsession, and they all agreed that if they were going to make a racing film, it had to look real. The first step was getting Formula 1 on board as an official partner on the film, with a view to embedding production in real Grand Prix races worldwide. Having seen F1\u2019s popularity surge following Netflix\u2019s Drive to Survive, CEO Stefano Domenicali was open to the idea but harboured concerns about how the sport would come across. Thankfully, super producer Jerry Bruckheimer is no stranger to sweet-talking nervy organisations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I did the first Top Gun, the navy was worried about how they\u2019d be portrayed, so Tom Cruise and I went to the US Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego to convince them it would be a good thing, and instead the admiral threw us off the base,\u201d laughs Bruckheimer. \u201cSo Tom went to Washington and met with the Secretary of the Navy at the time, and he understood what a movie could do for recruitment. We got to shoot Top Gun, and after it came out, naval recruitment went up 500%. Oh, and the other admiral was fired.\u201d Bruckheimer\u2019s Top Gun-inspired pitch was enough to convince Domenicali, and the group secured Formula 1 as an official partner, allowing them to film at 14 Grand Prix events. Current F1 drivers, including our very own Oscar Piastri, agreed to appear. Brad Pitt and Jerry Bruckheimer on the set of F1. Credit: The next hurdle was figuring out how to bring the audience inside the chaos of a machine that can reach a top speed of 374.97 km/h. \u201cCameras,\u201d says Kosinski, perking up. \u201cAnd lots of them.\u201d He\u2019s not lying. To ensure authenticity, the film\u2019s team, in collaboration with Mercedes-AMG and Formula 1 team engineers, built six F2 cars, which were then customised to resemble modern F1 cars. Each car came affixed with four IMAX-certified cameras in 15 possible positions, plus up to six additional cameras inside the car\u2019s cockpit. \u201cWe worked closely with Sony, who created the cameras for Top Gun, to create a smaller version that would allow us to swivel between the driver and the track.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKosinski is a self-described \u201cattention to detail fanatic,\u201d meaning F1 would always look the part. However, few people know how it feels to race\u2014the sounds, smells, noise, fury, joy, and heartbreak. Enter Lewis Hamilton. With seven World Drivers\u2019 Championship titles, Hamilton is the most successful F1 driver of all time (tied with Michael Schumacher), a driving prodigy who holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (202). He also happened to be the only driver Kosinski knew. \u201cWe talked about casting him in Top Gun: Maverick; he\u2019s friends with Tom [Cruise]. We couldn\u2019t make it happen, but through that conversation, I had Lewis\u2019 email, so I asked for help, and straight away, he was on board,\u201d says Kosinski. According to Bruckheimer, Hamilton wasn\u2019t shy of critiquing the film\u2019s inaccuracies during production. \u201cWe were filming in Silverstone, where they host the British Grand Prix, and in turn three, Lewis could hear that we were in the wrong gear,\u201d he says. \u201cBrad was in third gear, and you take that turn in second gear; not many people in the world would know that.\u201d Aside from gear changes, Hamilton\u2019s insight as the first black driver to compete in the F1 proved invaluable to Idris. \u201cThe beauty of this movie is that Lewis exists, and the barriers that he\u2019s broken down means Joshua Pearce can exist on screen too,\u201d says Idris. \u201cWe spoke about what it means to be an advocate without seeking out that label, so I modelled Joshua on Lewis.\u201d On paper, F1 is the kind of film destined for success. A high-octane blockbuster based on a hugely popular sport featuring an all-star cast on screen and Hollywood heavyweights behind the scenes. However, in an increasingly competitive marketplace, films still need to be sold to audiences, which might be the one thing Brad Pitt isn\u2019t good at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, Bruckheimer attended Liberty Media\u2019s (the company that owns Formula One) investor day in New York. He discussed Pitt\u2019s reluctance to self-promote there, telling the crowd, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to do press.\u201d This approach is at odds with Bruckheimer\u2019s other most recent A-list collaborator, Tom Cruise, a famously shrewd marketing machine who boosts the profile of his films with attention-grabbing stunts and endless global press tours. However, with a reported budget of $463 million, Bruckheimer requires Pitt in full salesman mode ahead of the film\u2019s release. \u201cBrad has told me he loves the movie and wants to go out and support it, so he\u2019ll join us on the world tour.\u201d Brad Pitt and girlfriend Ines de Ramon at the 2024 British Grand Prix. Credit: Getty Images As for Idris, he seems to be channelling the rookie energy of F1\u2019s Joshua Pearce, all wide-eyed enthusiasm accompanied by mild disbelief that any of this is happening. \u201cTo be talking about working with Brad Pitt on a Formula One movie still blows my mind,\u201d he laughs. On the day we speak, it\u2019s announced that he will play jazz legend Miles Davis in the upcoming film Miles & Juliette. The movie will explore Davis\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co during his 1949 trip to Paris. Anamaria Vartolomei will portray Gr\u00e9co, and the film is produced by Mick Jagger\u2019s company, Jagged Films. \u201cThere are so many interesting icons out there that I want to pay homage to, and Miles was at the top of my list,\u201d says Idris. \u201cThis is my dream job, and I can\u2019t wait to stretch myself, show my range and learn the trumpet!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "America\u2019s politicians have babies on the brain. In February, President Donald Trump told officials to make IVF cheaper. Even without its procreator-in-chief, Elon Musk, the White House is thought to be working on a bigger package of pro-natalist policies. Vice-President J.D. Vance is keen. Mr Trump says he favours a $US5000 (about $7700) handout for new parents. In Britain, meanwhile, Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, a MAGA-ish opposition party, has proposed tax breaks and benefits to encourage women to have more children.\n\nPoliticians have long feared the fiscal consequences of an ageing population, with too few young workers supporting legions of pensioners. Governments in places with very low birth rates, such as Japan and South Korea, have spent billions trying to reverse the decline, with little success. The new pro-natalist policies of the transatlantic right differ from older ones in that they are more targeted at working-class women, whose fertility rate has fallen the most. That might make them a bit more effective. But not at a reasonable cost, or without creating perverse incentives.\n\nThere is no evidence that working-class women in America currently have fewer offspring than they actually want. Credit: Getty\n\nPrevious attempts to deliver a baby boom have either failed or been eye-wateringly expensive, relative to the number of extra births they deliver. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, started a big pro-natal push in 2011, and has since given parents everything from tax breaks and cash handouts to free child care. These policies cost a staggering 5.5 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP annually \u2013 more than almost any government will spend on an ageing population in any year between now and 2050. In February, mothers of two were promised a lifelong exemption from income tax.\n\nHungary\u2019s fertility rate rose to 1.6 children per woman in 2018, from 1.2 in 2011, making it a poster child for populist pro-natalists everywhere. However, it has since dipped, suggesting handouts encouraged some mums not to have more babies, but to have the same number sooner. Other countries, including Japan, Norway and Poland, have tried tax breaks, handouts, maternity leave, subsidised child care and even state-sponsored dating, to little effect. Such policies mostly soften the blow to the finances and career prospects of professional women from having children, without persuading them to have more.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2023, international student Amy - not her real name - thought she had found a secure job in Darwin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe then 30-year-old was hired as a student service officer, by vocational education provider International House Sydney, where she was studying for an Advanced Diploma in Program Management.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd unlike cash-in-hand casual jobs that many international students and new migrants often take, Amy felt secure with the position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a part-time permanent job, because I was on a student visa, so I could only work part-time, but it was a permanent contract.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in January 2025 the company went into liquidation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy's Australian colleagues were able to access the Australian government's Fair Entitlements Guarantee, or FEG.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guarantee allows people to claim back wages, redundancy payments and other entitlements after a company closes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut because Amy was an international student, she wasn't eligible for the scheme meaning that until today, she still hasn't been paid some wages or other entitlements after the company closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I thought that I would be more protected if I had a permanent contract. But then, when this happened, I realised that as an migrant, I do not have the same rights. I cannot access the same, yes, the same safety net as an Australian or a (permanent) resident.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to International House Sydney's liquidator, PKF Melbourne, the education provider had been trading at a loss from at least June 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time it went into administration, it had around 3,800 students and 318 staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy says they were informed by the liquidator that if funds remained after the liquidation, staff who couldn't access the FEG would be prioritised for repayment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News have put questions about follow-up payments with migrant staff to PKF Melbourne, but they didn't reply specifically to the question.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an issue facing many small and medium-size education providers after the federal government tightened international student enrolments last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFelix Pirie is the chief executive of Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We saw a big downturn for students to apply, to come or even consider lodging an application to come to Australia to undertake skills training courses but also English language programs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by the ITECA, in 2021 there are around 162,000 students enrolling in independent higher education providers with over half of them international students.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Pirie says the increased fees for visa applications and the slowdown of visa process hit his sector most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The outcome of these things is that independent providers are the ones singled out at the end of the day, or they are the one that certainly feels the biggest impacts, and it's the people they employ. So they employ significant workforce, and when their business start to suffer, those people lose their jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an international student finds their education provider goes into administration, they have the right to access the government's Tuition Protection Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis helps students find alternative course options and get a full refund from the provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Kunkel is the Chief Executive Officer of Migrant Workers Centre in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says many international students are also employed in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the other impact on this is for many migrant workers is that once they complete their education in Australia, many of them are moving into the education sector themselves, and in particular the international education sector. So for those workers who have come to build a life, to get an education and build a life in Australia, these international caps are putting pressure on jobs in the sector.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the then Coalition government released the final report from the government's Migrant Workers' Taskforce, which recommended an expansion of the FEG to all migrant workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Migrant Workers' Taskforce was established in 2016 to tackle migrant worker exploitation but since the 2019 report - the FEG has yet to be expanded.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025 the Albanese Labor government announced a consultation process looking into reforms to the FEG, after some businesses were found to have misused the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kunkel says the federal government needs to allow international students and migrant workers to access the FEG as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our visa system is built around this idea that international students are here just to study. But the reality is that many of those international students are here working and studying in Australia, and we need a visa system that allows those workers who are coming, those international students who are coming to Australia to be able to live a dignified life as they study and get that education.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeri Feldman-Gubbay is a senior solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also agrees that there's a gap between the safety net for local workers and international students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that the biggest thing is that a lot of Australian employing businesses rely on the fact that international students will be unfamiliar with the legal system and the rules in Australia. And so there will be, I guess, a false sense of confidence that is this employer is going to do right by me, when, in actual fact, a lot of employers take advantage of that lack of knowledge to then do the wrong thing and leave people in a really bad position.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd without the FEG scheme, Ms Feldman-Gubbay says for employees like Amy taking claims to court is one option.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy wants to see a change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I will ever be compensated, because I doubt there's money to be found, but I would really hope that in the future, nobody else has to go through this situation, or also for there to at least be something that is more talked about. I have not heard about this until it happened to me. I think that every migrant should know that this is something that could happen to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Like many, April Willis has been using social media since her early teens.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she grew up on the platforms, she says she didn't immediately understand the impact it was having on her.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that in hindsight, though, she can see that a lot of her \"behaviours\" and \"the content and interactions\" she had on social media platforms were \"definitely not great\" for her mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the now 22-year-old ReachOut youth advocate says she doesn't think a ban would have stopped her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the hard truth is that a lot of us are thinking, 'I would've found a way around it', as I'm sure many young people will.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether she actually would have is one of the many questions experts are wondering six months out from the implementation of Australia's social media ban for those under the age of 16.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation for the \"world-leading\" ban, as described by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, passed on parliament's final sitting day in November 2024 with a 12-month enforcement delay.\n\n\n\nAs of 11 December this year, social media companies will be required to take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent Australian children and teenagers under 16 from using their platforms.\n\n\n\nCan age assurance be done effectively in Australia?\n\nA government-commissioned trial into the potential technologies used to assess the ages of users presented their preliminary findings on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir key finding was that \"age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The preliminary findings indicate that there are no significant technological barriers preventing the deployment of effective age assurance systems in Australia,\" project director Tony Allen said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services, and can support the safety and rights of children online.\"\n\n\n\nThe communications minister will decide which apps are included in the ban. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett With details about the accuracy of the technologies tested left for later release, experts are wary of the trial's initial claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Angus is a professor of digital communication at the Queensland University of Technology and the director of its Digital Media Research Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the key concerns that we have is how the industry often will inflate their accuracy and the utility of these approaches when we know that there are still significant issues when it comes to both gender and also racial biases, but also the general lack of efficacy of these approaches,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Communications, a government-commissioned report from the Social Research Centre found nearly nine in 10 adults were supportive of age assurance measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly two of those 10 had heard of at least one potential method to check a person's age online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis research shows Australians widely support our world-leading age restrictions on social media for under 16s and have strong expectations of platforms when it comes to data protection and security,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAustralians could be 'in for a rude shock'\n\nAngus says the general public has not been adequately informed about the likely impacts of these technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australians are in for a very rude shock when this actually perhaps, gets implemented, and they all of a sudden are being forced to hand over [their] data to access services that they've freely been able to access up to this point,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's absolutely everything you would expect to find in the midst of a moral panic where people have been sucked along with this idea that, 'Yeah, this thing is really, really bad and we need to prevent it,' but have not stopped to think critically about this, and then not been properly informed about the fullness of that risk.\"\n\n\n\nJohn Pane, chair of digital rights organisation Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA), is a member of the stakeholder advisory board for the trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the EFA has \"concerns about the rollout of this technology because it's not simply about restricting access to social media platforms for children 15 and under\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It requires all adults who participate in the online environment, who wish to access social media platforms to either have their age authenticated or establish their identity as a means of, or part of that age authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So from our perspective, it's the Trojan horse for getting people to get used to providing more and more credentials online.\"\n\n\n\n'A really good start'\n\nAmid these concerns, some remain supportive of the ban, including Kirra Pendergast, another member of the stakeholder advisory board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially, I was only against the ban purely because of the technical workarounds that are possible for some kids who are more technical than others,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But after having lots of conversations with parents in particular, it became abundantly clear that the ban was making parents have a conversation that we've needed to have for a very, very long time.\"\n\n\n\nPendergast is the founder of Safe on Social, an online safety advisory group for schools and businesses, and chief digital safety strategist at the global Ctrl+Shft Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I get contacted almost every single day by parents that are struggling with this,\" the cybersecurity expert said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't know how to say no.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPendergast said parents and educators would have \"a lot more time to get it right\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like all aspects of technical security, cybersecurity, and cyber safety. It's never ever going to be 100 per cent. This is never going to be the silver bullet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a really, really good start because, again, it sparked all of the conversations that we needed to have at every level of society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Tama Leaver, an internet studies academic at Curtin University and the chief investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, says the ban responds to a \"very real fear that parents have that social media is an unknown space\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If this is world-leading, we need to be quite clear on what the legislation is actually doing.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia is the first country to try to implement a teen social media ban. Source: AAP / Dean Lewins He warned that the implementation of the policy may not address all the issues that have been discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some harms, for example, such as cyberbullying, were very much touted as one of the big problems to be solved,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is nothing in this legislation that addresses cyberbullying meaningfully at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This at best addresses algorithmic amplification \u2026 of young people's experiences of social media, but \u2026 we expect from what's been said already that most messaging apps are exempt from this legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, the spaces where we imagine cyberbullying is most likely to happen are not being touched by this legislation at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaver was a signatory on an open letter from more than 140 academics and civil society organisations against the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the rest of the world is watching Australia and hoping that this might be a blueprint, we're going to have an awful lot of work to do in the next few months to actually have a blueprint to practically do this rather than simply aspire to giving parents some reassurance,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nNuha Abdul Razaq arrived in Australia from Iraq as a refugee in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the topic of suicide is something many from the Arabic-speaking community find especially difficult to talk about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a topic which they never talk about it in our country. When I was in Iraq or many people, I have clients from Syria, from different countries, from Lebanon or from Jordan, maybe we didn't talk it, we didn't talk about suicide in our countries. It's like, some people they feel it's shameful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe now delivers suicide prevention workshops in Arabic for refugees and asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workshops are part of a program launched by Wesley LifeForce which provides training in suicide prevention in six languages: Arabic, Dari, Farsi, Karen, Khmer and Tamil.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's co-designed with survivors of torture, trauma and forced displacement, paired up with the program by an organisation called Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors - STARTTS.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Abdul Razaq says the success of the training is in large part because it's delivered by people like herself who understand the challenges and stresses of displacement and resettlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To move to another country, it's not easy. Some people, they stay in camps for 10 years, 12 years, moving to other country, which is different languages, financial, most of them, they don't have any money to spend, even if they move to other country, if they want to find a job, it's struggling to get a job. And when you get settlement to Australia, another one, you have all (the) stress comes with you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent research shows refugees and asylum seekers in Australia experience disproportionately high rates of suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows between 2007\u20132020, humanitarian entrants to Australia were 1.7 times more likely to die by suicide compared to other permanent migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nBethany Farley, the National Training Manager at Wesley Lifeforce, says the broader figures around mental wellbeing for refugees and asylum seekers are also deeply concerning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's reports that show that over 50% do actually report that they have poor mental health with more than 25% experiencing PTSD. There are some other reports around thoughts of suicide, which for men can be as high as 10% and for women can be as high as 17%.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy CEO of STARTTS Lachlan Murdoch says the trauma of war and displacement presents complex psychological challenges for refugees and asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So being pushed out of your country in traumatic circumstances, exposure to conflict and war, being subjected to things like shelling and bombardment, in some cases being imprisoned and being held in circumstances of great deprivation. Experiences of torture. So all those things impact people in ways that affect their psyche. So refugees experience much higher levels of anxiety and depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says for asylums seekers, these experiences of trauma can be further complicated by fear of being returned to the country they have fled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Asylum seekers are in a situation where they're living in protracted uncertainty. And so there's not clarity for them about whether the person will remain in a situation of relative safety or could be returned to circumstances of danger. So that experience of uncertainty also compounds the traumatic effects of exposure to violence and to conflict.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Farley says these challenges are exacerbated by a lack of access to culturally appropriate care for refugees and asylum seekers arriving in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then you add the other challenges of a language barrier, not understanding how the processes work. And finding services that have translators or people that can actually understand the nuances of how their community and culture responds to different situations, to different processes. The mental health models themselves can be alienating in that they do not meet the needs of a multicultural community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suicide prevention training delivered by community members like Ms Abdul Razaq aims to address some of these issues by facilitating workshops where participants can share experiences in their own language and learn from each other about the supports available.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Abdul Razaq says the stigma attached to speaking about suicide was initially a barrier for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And at the beginning I was stressed when I was trained for the first time and I hearing something, some information, but later I accepted that if that's happening in the community, we need all the community to know about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter delivering the first training session, she says she was inspired by the openness of the participants, and their ability to move past any shame they might associate with talking about suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nine women attended and it was very good and I liked the way they talk about it. They open their mouth and talk about their stories as well. And it's to build comfortable space between us and to build the trust between us. When they want to talk, they will talk in a normal way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know needs crisis support, contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information and support with mental health is available at beyondblue.org.au and on 1300 22 4636.\n\n\n\n",

Jamarra Ugle-Hagan has been absent from Western Bulldogs training for much of this year. Credit: Darrian Traynor \u201cWhen you are down, you want to keep finding an upper. My upper was probably staying and hanging out with my mates and getting on the piss and training with them as well,\u201d Ugle-Hagan said. \u201cBut it just had no end goal \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a game. I didn\u2019t have anything. My mental health wasn\u2019t in the right space, so I was struggling, and I found it really tough to even enjoy football. \u201cI lost the fun in it. I didn\u2019t want to play. It wasn\u2019t even a priority because all I wanted to do was find something, but I didn\u2019t know what that was until I had this break.\u201d\n\nUgle-Hagan said speaking at the retreat about his mental health challenges helped him realise that he was not alone. \u201cIt takes balls to talk in a group but once you do it, it is f---ing amazing. It feels good, and they have answers for you,\u201d he said. Jamarra Ugle-Hagan recreated Nicky Winmar\u2019s famous gesture by facing the crown and pointing to his skin in 2023. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYou think you are alone and no one understands, but when you speak up and hear people\u2019s stories, it makes you feel so much better ... knowing they\u2019re going through the same thing you are.\u201d Ugle-Hagan also explained his absence from the Bulldogs\u2019 centenary anniversary match this year \u2013 which the likes of David King and James Hird criticised him for \u2013 saying he had to talk his best friend from Warrnambool out of taking his own life.\n\nHe ended up inviting his friend to Melbourne and spending that weekend with him. Ugle-Hagan, who grew up on an Aboriginal township in Framlingham, near Warrnambool, said that was not the only time he confronted suicide, revealing that \u201cmultiple\u201d family members had taken their own lives. \u201cWe found our cousin in his room. I found my uncle, or my family found our uncle, in the gutter down the road from our house,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shit I have seen. I have seen a lot more than that as well.\u201d No.1 pick Jamarra Ugle-Hagan celebrates with family on draft night. Credit: Getty Images The young star also stated his focus was on proving himself at training \u2013 and not the potential of seeking a fresh start elsewhere, such as Sydney, who have been strongly linked to the 2020 No.1 draft pick.\n\nLoading \u201cI\u2019m obviously still contracted with the \u2018Doggies\u2019. I still want to play for them and win a flag,\u201d Ugle-Hagan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Bulldogs until my contract runs out, and then hopefully they offer me another one, but we will see how we go. They have given me opportunities since day dot, so why can\u2019t I get back?\u201d Experiencing everything that comes with competing at the highest level is driving Ugle-Hagan as he tries to convince coach Luke Beveridge and his teammates that he is ready to play again. \u201cI want to play footy. I can\u2019t wait to play footy,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading I want to kick a f---ing goal in front of those crowds. I have been watching every single Bulldogs game. I have been supporting them [and] watching them. I will go to games at the end of the year. \u201cI genuinely want to play one more [game]. I want to play some games. It\u2019s going to be grouse.\u201d Beveridge said this month that Ugle-Hagan was \u201cour player\u201d and they were committed to supporting him, while Ugle-Hagan said the club\u2019s chief executive, Ameet Bains, was like a \u201cbrother\u201d to him. \u201cI\u2019m good friends with the doctor and good mates with all the boys \u2013 there are different characters,\u201d Ugle-Hagan said. \u201cYou go in there, they look after you, and they genuinely love you in there.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Sitting in a hotel in 2023, Damson Idris had just landed the most important role of his life. Legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joe Kosinski, the team who took over the box office (OK, and the world) with Top Gun: Maverick, wanted Idris for their high-stakes Formula 1 blockbuster, F1. Idris would play Joshua Pearce, a young gun rookie modelled on Lewis Hamilton (also a producer on the film), and Brad Pitt would play his team-mate and rival, Sonny Hayes, a grizzled veteran who returns to the sport to partner Pearce on the fictional APXGP team. As far as big breaks go, they don\u2019t come much bigger than this. So you\u2019d imagine Idris\u2019 mind might be racing faster than the F1 car he didn\u2019t know how to drive (but would soon master). Damson Idris as Joshua Pearce and Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes in a scene from \u201cF1: The Movie.\u201d Credit: AP \u201cNot really,\u201d deadpans Idris, speaking to me from South Africa, where he is shooting his next film. \u201cI was just consumed by one thought: I need to be faster than Brad Pitt.\u201d Fast-forward a year or so, and after hundreds of hours on the practice circuit, seven months of training, more than a few crashes, several headaches, and roughly eight kilos lost purely from sweating on set, Idris learned a valuable lesson. \u201cBrad Pitt is annoyingly good at everything,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd I mean everything: acting, racing, even walking. The way he walks on screen is second to none.\u201d I mention that one of my favourite YouTube clips is a super cut of Brad Pitt eating in all his different films (it\u2019s called 15 Minutes of Brad Pitt Eating, and well worth a watch).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d says Idris. \u201cI attempted eating in one scene during F1, and they scrapped it, and you know what? Good on them. I\u2019m with the greatest on-screen eater of all time. Come on, man, what were you thinking?\u201d \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019 is a question I\u2019ve been meaning to ask director Joseph Kosinski. In 2022, he helped \u201csave cinema\u201d (Spielberg\u2019s words, not mine) with Top Gun: Maverick, a sweeping sequel to the 1986 original that was critically and commercially celebrated, grossing $1.496 billion worldwide at the box office. Such a feat warrants time off. A mini-break. Honestly, Joe, what were you thinking? \u201cWell, as with so many people, during the pandemic, I became obsessed with Drive to Survive on Netflix,\u201d says Kosinski. \u201cI went to school for mechanical engineering and aerospace, so the way these cars work is fascinating to me, and then factor in the personalities and team dynamics, it\u2019s rich with story.\u201d Pitt and Bruckheimer shared Kosinski\u2019s obsession, and they all agreed that if they were going to make a racing film, it had to look real. The first step was getting Formula 1 on board as an official partner on the film, with a view to embedding production in real Grand Prix races worldwide. Having seen F1\u2019s popularity surge following Netflix\u2019s Drive to Survive, CEO Stefano Domenicali was open to the idea but harboured concerns about how the sport would come across. Thankfully, super producer Jerry Bruckheimer is no stranger to sweet-talking nervy organisations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I did the first Top Gun, the navy was worried about how they\u2019d be portrayed, so Tom Cruise and I went to the US Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego to convince them it would be a good thing, and instead the admiral threw us off the base,\u201d laughs Bruckheimer. \u201cSo Tom went to Washington and met with the Secretary of the Navy at the time, and he understood what a movie could do for recruitment. We got to shoot Top Gun, and after it came out, naval recruitment went up 500%. Oh, and the other admiral was fired.\u201d Bruckheimer\u2019s Top Gun-inspired pitch was enough to convince Domenicali, and the group secured Formula 1 as an official partner, allowing them to film at 14 Grand Prix events. Current F1 drivers, including our very own Oscar Piastri, agreed to appear. Brad Pitt and Jerry Bruckheimer on the set of F1. Credit: The next hurdle was figuring out how to bring the audience inside the chaos of a machine that can reach a top speed of 374.97 km/h. \u201cCameras,\u201d says Kosinski, perking up. \u201cAnd lots of them.\u201d He\u2019s not lying. To ensure authenticity, the film\u2019s team, in collaboration with Mercedes-AMG and Formula 1 team engineers, built six F2 cars, which were then customised to resemble modern F1 cars. Each car came affixed with four IMAX-certified cameras in 15 possible positions, plus up to six additional cameras inside the car\u2019s cockpit. \u201cWe worked closely with Sony, who created the cameras for Top Gun, to create a smaller version that would allow us to swivel between the driver and the track.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKosinski is a self-described \u201cattention to detail fanatic,\u201d meaning F1 would always look the part. However, few people know how it feels to race\u2014the sounds, smells, noise, fury, joy, and heartbreak. Enter Lewis Hamilton. With seven World Drivers\u2019 Championship titles, Hamilton is the most successful F1 driver of all time (tied with Michael Schumacher), a driving prodigy who holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (202). He also happened to be the only driver Kosinski knew. \u201cWe talked about casting him in Top Gun: Maverick; he\u2019s friends with Tom [Cruise]. We couldn\u2019t make it happen, but through that conversation, I had Lewis\u2019 email, so I asked for help, and straight away, he was on board,\u201d says Kosinski. According to Bruckheimer, Hamilton wasn\u2019t shy of critiquing the film\u2019s inaccuracies during production. \u201cWe were filming in Silverstone, where they host the British Grand Prix, and in turn three, Lewis could hear that we were in the wrong gear,\u201d he says. \u201cBrad was in third gear, and you take that turn in second gear; not many people in the world would know that.\u201d Aside from gear changes, Hamilton\u2019s insight as the first black driver to compete in the F1 proved invaluable to Idris. \u201cThe beauty of this movie is that Lewis exists, and the barriers that he\u2019s broken down means Joshua Pearce can exist on screen too,\u201d says Idris. \u201cWe spoke about what it means to be an advocate without seeking out that label, so I modelled Joshua on Lewis.\u201d On paper, F1 is the kind of film destined for success. A high-octane blockbuster based on a hugely popular sport featuring an all-star cast on screen and Hollywood heavyweights behind the scenes. However, in an increasingly competitive marketplace, films still need to be sold to audiences, which might be the one thing Brad Pitt isn\u2019t good at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, Bruckheimer attended Liberty Media\u2019s (the company that owns Formula One) investor day in New York. He discussed Pitt\u2019s reluctance to self-promote there, telling the crowd, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to do press.\u201d This approach is at odds with Bruckheimer\u2019s other most recent A-list collaborator, Tom Cruise, a famously shrewd marketing machine who boosts the profile of his films with attention-grabbing stunts and endless global press tours. However, with a reported budget of $463 million, Bruckheimer requires Pitt in full salesman mode ahead of the film\u2019s release. \u201cBrad has told me he loves the movie and wants to go out and support it, so he\u2019ll join us on the world tour.\u201d Brad Pitt and girlfriend Ines de Ramon at the 2024 British Grand Prix. Credit: Getty Images As for Idris, he seems to be channelling the rookie energy of F1\u2019s Joshua Pearce, all wide-eyed enthusiasm accompanied by mild disbelief that any of this is happening. \u201cTo be talking about working with Brad Pitt on a Formula One movie still blows my mind,\u201d he laughs. On the day we speak, it\u2019s announced that he will play jazz legend Miles Davis in the upcoming film Miles & Juliette. The movie will explore Davis\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co during his 1949 trip to Paris. Anamaria Vartolomei will portray Gr\u00e9co, and the film is produced by Mick Jagger\u2019s company, Jagged Films. \u201cThere are so many interesting icons out there that I want to pay homage to, and Miles was at the top of my list,\u201d says Idris. \u201cThis is my dream job, and I can\u2019t wait to stretch myself, show my range and learn the trumpet!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Even without its procreator-in-chief, Elon Musk, the White House is thought to be working on a bigger package of pro-natalist policies. Vice-President J.D. Vance is keen. Mr Trump says he favours a $US5000 (about $7700) handout for new parents. In Britain, meanwhile, Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, a MAGA-ish opposition party, has proposed tax breaks and benefits to encourage women to have more children.\n\nPoliticians have long feared the fiscal consequences of an ageing population, with too few young workers supporting legions of pensioners. Governments in places with very low birth rates, such as Japan and South Korea, have spent billions trying to reverse the decline, with little success. The new pro-natalist policies of the transatlantic right differ from older ones in that they are more targeted at working-class women, whose fertility rate has fallen the most. That might make them a bit more effective. But not at a reasonable cost, or without creating perverse incentives.\n\nThere is no evidence that working-class women in America currently have fewer offspring than they actually want. Credit: Getty\n\nPrevious attempts to deliver a baby boom have either failed or been eye-wateringly expensive, relative to the number of extra births they deliver. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, started a big pro-natal push in 2011, and has since given parents everything from tax breaks and cash handouts to free child care. These policies cost a staggering 5.5 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP annually \u2013 more than almost any government will spend on an ageing population in any year between now and 2050. In February, mothers of two were promised a lifelong exemption from income tax.\n\nHungary\u2019s fertility rate rose to 1.6 children per woman in 2018, from 1.2 in 2011, making it a poster child for populist pro-natalists everywhere. However, it has since dipped, suggesting handouts encouraged some mums not to have more babies, but to have the same number sooner. Other countries, including Japan, Norway and Poland, have tried tax breaks, handouts, maternity leave, subsidised child care and even state-sponsored dating, to little effect. Such policies mostly soften the blow to the finances and career prospects of professional women from having children, without persuading them to have more.",

        "text": "The Sydney woman paid for her breakfast and was walking towards an empty table when she was stopped by the cashier.\n\nThe woman had purchased breakfast from a cafe in Broadway and was faced with an unexpected cost. Would you've paid it? Source: Supplied\n\nA Sydney woman\u2019s breakfast treat got off to a sour start after she was faced with an additional cost she wasn\u2019t expecting.\n\nAfter ordering the $13 breakfast combo from the takeaway menu, she went to find a table but was stopped by the cashier who told her she'd have to pay more to sit down to have her egg and bacon roll and hot chocolate.\n\nWhen asked how much, the cashier at the Broadway cafe told her it would be $17 if she wanted to dine-in \u2014 an increase of 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cSo now sitting comes with a $4 upgrade? Maybe the chair reclines, plays Netflix, and offers emotional support?\u201d the stunned diner said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe declined to pay extra for a table, and instead stood \u201cawkwardly\u201d in front of a bank, \u201cholding my greasy brown paper bag and eating like a pigeon\u201d while she waited for the bank to open.\n\nThe customer, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Yahoo News the charge came as a shock and has changed the way she buys coffee.\n\n\"I mean, I know life is getting more and more expensive, but that much just to sit down and enjoy the brekky, then I don't think it's normal,\" she said.\n\nThe woman said she couldn't see any signs advising of the price difference, but later noted the menu had 'takeaway' written on it.\n\nAnother customer's review of the cafe from three years ago complained of the same issue. She was told a takeaway coffee would cost $3.70, whereas sitting in would be $4.50. When she asked why, staff told her it's \"because we have to clean the mug\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYahoo News has approached the cafe to confirm its pricing policy but they have not responded. On the cafe's standard menu, viewed online, an egg and bacon roll was $13 and a regular hot chocolate $5.30. The takeaway combo of the two items sells for a discounted $13.\n\nCafe owner explains why dining in costs more\n\nFranco Amitrano, who owns Cafe & Cuchina in Surry Hills, explained to Yahoo why dining in comes with a higher cost.\n\nHis cafe, which has been operating for 11 years, charges customers an additional 20 cents if they choose to drink their coffee at the venue. Food is the same price, whether it's takeaway or dine-in.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Mainly it's because the barista takes a bit longer to make it look nice, to make latte art,\" he said.\n\nFranco Amitrano has been running his cafe for 11 years and says his customers have never complained about the extra 20 cent charge to dine in for coffee. Source: Instagram/CafeAndCuchina\n\n\"For me, it's not the washing up that is part of (the cost), because you have to pay for cups anyway when you take it away. So it's kind of the same.\n\n\"It's more because the barista has to take a bit longer to do the service and you have to get someone to deliver it to the table. So that's the extra in labour.\"\n\nFranco added that his customers have never had an issue with the additional cost, but he does think charging $4 extra for dining in is too much. \"I don\u2019t think many people charge that kind of increase if you dine in,\" he said.\n\nDine-in charges \u2018not advisable\u2019, expert says\n\nWhile the different pricing structures for takeaway and dining in are becoming more common, they may not be in the best interest of the venue, Professor of Marketing at UNSW Nitika Garg told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt's becoming more common with prices going up and costs going up. People are reasonable and people are understanding of these structures, but I think there is a way to do it,\" she said.\n\nAdding on extra costs at the checkout is a \"short-sighted strategy\", marketing expert Nitika Garg said. Source: Getty\n\nGarg explained that adding on extra costs to the customer is known in the marketing world as \"unbundling\".\n\n\"Instead of bundling, you're unbundling the cost,\" she said, giving budget airlines as an example where the fare, the seat, the food and the luggage are all available but for additional costs. Unbundling typically leads to a poor customer experience and is usually \"not advisable\", she added.\n\nWhat would be more satisfactory from a diner's perspective is to have the same price across the board, \"even if the takeaway price is slightly high\",Garg said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Locals want to see the 'heart' of the island restored to native woodland, and believe this is their 'once-in-a-generation' chance.\n\nThe pine forest takes up more than 2,500 hectares of land on Bribie Island, with many homes around the southern end. Source: Google Earth\n\nJust off the coast of Brisbane's north lies Bribie Island, a 34km stretch of land that has seen a rapid transformation in recent years. With its pristine beaches, growing population and rising property values, the island has become a hotspot not just for tourists, but for investors and sea-changers alike.\n\nYet, tucked away from the beaches, shops and golf courses is a huge pine plantation that takes up nearly 20 per cent of the island. It\u2019s been a working forest for decades, but it\u2019s also sitting on land that would be worth millions on today\u2019s market.\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, the trees are about to be harvested \u2014 and that\u2019s opened the door for a different conversation.\n\nMany locals are calling for change. Rather than replanting rows and rows of introduced pines, they want to bring back native forests and parklands to \"restore the heart\" of the island. And with the harvest beginning in July, they feel like this could be a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity to restore the land before more pines are planted and a new cycle begins.\n\nThe environmental association would like to see the gradual return of some of the plantation land. Source: BIEPA\n\n\"This is the best opportunity that we'll have to negotiate a better outcome for the environment,\" Richard Ogden, president of the Bribie Island Environmental Protection Association Inc (BIEPA), told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Bribie is really trying to step up and do what's necessary to protect and conserve nature for future generations.\"\n\nBIEPA say the plantation is impacting the natural landscape of the island in several ways:\n\nInadequate control of feral pigs with the plantation\n\nDrifting herbicide damaging native vegetation\n\nPine 'wildlings' invading other areas of parklands\n\nFears of pollution from fertiliser\n\nBig trucks loaded with logs could damage the Bribie Island Bridge\n\nHarvest set to take place over the next 10 years\n\nSeveral weeks ago, HQPlantations (HQP) sent a letter to residents advising of the upcoming harvest. The population has grown by more than 50 per cent since the last harvest took place, with BIEPA fearing that some new residents may not even be aware that industrial forestry operates on the island.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a new statement on their website, HQP said they have modified their plans to minimise impacts to residents and road users. The pines will be harvested over the next 10 years at a rate of approximately 100 hectares per year.\n\nWhile HQP didn't respond to Yahoo's questions about future plans for the land, it confirmed in the statement that it would be replanting pine seedlings in accordance with its licensing. The company has a 99-year lease with the state government that began in 2010.\n\nHQP manages 310,000 hectares of plantation forests across NSW and Far North Queensland, planting up to 10 million seedlings annually. The Bribie Island site consists of 2,500 hectares of sustainably grown timber.\n\nIf the pines are replanted, what does it mean for Bribie's heart?\n\nRichard and his fellow volunteers at BIEPA understand that HQP are running a business and is not breaking any laws, but they feel that the goal of a restored forest can still be achieved.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What we'd like is for the state government to turn that back to a national park over time, but the only way that they (HQP) would probably agree to that is if the state government makes available an equivalent amount of land on the mainland,\" Richard said.\n\n\"We do like to see the plantation operators as neighbours and companions, and we like to see ourselves as valuable community partners.\n\nThis map shows the areas slated for the upcoming harvest, with the areas in green being targeted first. Source: HQ Plantations\n\n\"We're coming at it from a point of view of, obviously, conserving nature for the future and putting Bribie's nature first. But we also understand that there's a commercial imperative, and we have observed that there are very real perspectives on this, that it could very well be in the economic best interests in the future to move the plantations from Bribie.\n\n\"But as we understand, it's probably going to take a number of years. It could be a decade or even two decades before that actually became complete.\"\n\nState government, local council respond\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries said the plantation is essential to supply timber for the housing market.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"A sustainable local timber supply is required to manage the growing demand for housing and meet the Queensland Government\u2019s commitment of constructing one million homes by 2044,\" they said.\n\n\"Converting this plantation area to another use would require a change to the underlying State Forest tenure, and a compensation payment to HQP, which has a 99-year lease agreement. Further enquiries regarding plantation-harvesting operations on Bribie Island should be directed to HQP.\"\n\nThe City of Moreton Bay said it is committed to \"protecting and enhancing its natural areas and wildlife habitats\". \"While these activities are a matter for the Queensland Government, Council remains focused on \u2018Going Green as we Grow\u2019, playing its role in managing and protecting its natural areas while planning for urban growth,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe council\u2019s Environment and Sustainability Strategy 2042 aims to maintain the region's current native vegetation cover of 42 per cent, with a view to increasing it over time.\n\n\"Council also has a Land Buyback for Environmental Purposes Program to acquire, restore and rehabilitate land across the City to conserve ecological communities and wildlife habitats for the benefit of our communities,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn June 24, HQP is holding a community drop-in session for anyone looking for more information about the upcoming work.
