        "text": "Mining giant Fortescue hopes its new wind farm in Western Australia's Pilbara will be the \"first of many\" for the region.\n\nThe construction of 17 wind turbines for a 133 megawatt farm near Nullagine, 1,360 kilometres north east of Perth, officially began this month as part of Fortescue's plan to offset the emissions from its iron ore production by using renewable energy sources.\n\nThe project is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nFortescue CEO Dino Otranto said the design of the turbines was a \"world first\", and he expected the wind farm to be the first of many for the region.\n\n\"We need lower-cost electricity to stay competitive, and that is what this [wind farm] does,\" he said.\n\nHowever, a renewable energy consultant says while Fortescue is a \"best practice leader\" in operational decarbonisation, he does not expect an influx of new wind farms in Western Australia's north.\n\nWhy wind?\n\nThe Pilbara's mining industry is a significant contributor to WA's carbon footprint, accounting for more than 40 per cent of the state's total emissions.\n\nFrom pit to port, iron ore mining generally involves the use of diesel-powered vehicles like dump trucks, excavators and trains.\n\nCompanies across the region's mining sector have begun investing in renewable energy projects to decarbonise \u2014 predominantly solar \u2014 and in Fortescue's case, to power electric heavy vehicles.\n\nAn electric excavator trialled by Fortescue in its move towards transitioning to an electric fleet. (Supplied: Fortescue Metals)\n\nYet less than 2 per cent of energy generated in the Pilbara is renewable, according to the state government.\n\nUnlike solar, wind in certain areas has the potential to produce energy during the evening.\n\nMr Otranto said that was why the Nullagine wind farm would complement solar energy.\n\n\"What people don't understand is that we have a huge amount of great wind in the Pilbara as well, and the wind actually blows at night or in the late afternoon and early evening,\" he said.\n\nDino Otranto says the wind farm's design is a \"world first\". (Supplied: Fortescue Metals)\n\n\" For us it's a no-brainer in the Pilbara. \"\n\nThe China-made turbines will have an estimated height of 277 metres, making them taller than any others in Australia.\n\nMr Otranto said taller turbines produced more energy, which meant fewer were required to make the same amount of power.\n\nRenewable energy cost high\n\nFuture Smart Strategies managing director Ray Wills said Fortescue was a \"global, best practice leader\" in operational decarbonisation.\n\nHowever, he said the Nullagine project was \"ambitious\".\n\nRay Wills is a researcher, academic, consultant and futurist with a focus on sustainability and technology. (ABC News: Nicholas Martyr)\n\n\"The Pilbara is a difficult location to work for two reasons \u2014 one is the heat and cyclones,\" Professor Wills said.\n\n\"And the second reason is that your workforce has to be more expensive because you're FIFO.\"\n\nThe futurist said he did not think there would be an influx of new wind farms in Northern WA because it was still too expensive compared to the main alternative \u2014 solar.\n\nThe capacity of large-scale wind and solar power stations approved by the Clean Energy Regulator in Australia over the last five years. (Source: Clean Energy Regulator)\n\n\"Most certainly, wind has not reduced its price as quickly as solar has,\" he said.\n\n\"It can't be expensive energy, otherwise it will be expensive iron ore and on from there on to green iron.\n\n\"So we need to get the energy price continuously downwards.\"",

(Supplied: Dave Wellington)\n\nWorking 17 hours a day, every day\n\nMr Wellington and his friends responded to an advertisement for labouring work with The Great Moscow Circus performing at the Derwent Entertainment Centre.\n\nThe job involved setting up and packing down the bell tents, stages and circus equipment.\n\nThere were bears, horses, dogs, and lots of Russian performers walking around them.\n\nAfter a few days, they were asked whether they would like to join and travel with the circus as it toured Victoria, New South Wales, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHis mum and dad were less than impressed with his choice to join, as they were hoping he would apply to work at insurance companies or banks.\n\n\"You can imagine the look on both their faces when I said I'm hopping on a plane \u2026 and running away with the Moscow circus,\" he told ABC Afternoons.\n\n\"We worked for 17 hours a day on average for 7 days a week \u2026 [and] we were paid 2.81 per hour.\n\n\"It was hard work, but it was so enjoyable, and we met so many characters.\"\n\nTrained bears performed for crowds.

(Supplied: Dave Wellington)\n\nThe organisers would hire 100 to 200 labourers at each country town to help put the show on, according to Mr Wellington.\n\n\"There were a lot of people who were on the run,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of blokes would turn up and not even give names, as I can imagine they were on bail and things like that.\n\n\"It was a bit of an eye opener at 18 years of age.\"\n\nThe Great Moscow Circus has been Australian-owned since the Soviet Union collapsed. (Supplied: Great Moscow Circus Facebook)\n\nWatchful eye of the KGB\n\nIn 1990, the Great Moscow Circus was owned and run by the Soviet Union.\n\nThe KGB, or the Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopanosti, were a feared security service for the Soviet Union.\n\n\"The KGB were the security \u2026 they were immaculately dressed every day, black shoes, black suit, black tie with a white shirt and scary looking big men,\" Mr Wellington said.\n\n\" The performers were not allowed to roam free, they were not allowed out of the area that was fenced off. \"\n\nHe recalled a night they all snuck out with \"Sasha the bear trainer\", who had too much to drink and they all had to carry him back to the caravans without waking the KGB.\n\nLooking back, he said it was very risky as Sasha would have been sent back to the Soviet Union if caught.\n\nMr Wellington would call his parents from a phone box and remembered his mum threatening to get on a plane to come get him.\n\n\"I said mum there's KGB, and she said, 'Well, they're not going to stop me,'\" he said.\n\nThe Great Moscow Circus tours around Australia. (ABC Wide Bay: Scott Lamond)\n\nBeautiful bonds along the road\n\nIt was a sad goodbye when the time came for the three Tasmanian boys to go home.\n\nMany great relationships were made on the road, but one that stood out to Mr Wellington was a with another performer named Sasha, who was deaf.\n\n\"We were leaving on a bus at 6am and he had the KGB with him at the bus station and we gave him a hug,\" he said.\n\n\"As we drove off, and he was waving, it was just one of those moments where you look back and you think it's amazing to have a bond like that with someone that not only spoke a different language to you, but was also deaf.\"\n\nThe trademark name of the Great Moscow Circus was purchased by an Australian family after the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.\n\nThe circus is still touring Australia today, but has changed since the early 90s, with new performances and regular security guards.",

        "text": "Socceroos midfielder Jackson Irvine has made a quick return from injury to help struggling St Pauli in the Bundesliga.\n\nIn a massive boost for Australian head coach Tony Popovic, Irvine came on as a substitute in the 63rd minute to earn his team a crucial point in their goalless draw against Hamburg on Friday night (Sat AEDT).\n\nBarely 10 days ago, the relegation-threatened German outfit announced Irvine had suffered a foot injury and would be out indefinitely.\n\nHe subsequently missed the losses to Borussia Dortmund (3-2) and Wolfsburg (2-1), which plunged Kiezkicker (Neighbourhood Kickers) to joint-last position in the league.\n\nIrvine has struggled for fitness and form in recent months. (Getty Images via Bundesliga: Boris Streubel )\n\nEarlier this week, though, St Pauli's head coach Alexander Blessin said his skipper was a chance of playing.\n\n\"We are still in the testing phase. So we just have to see how his foot reacts,\" he told a news conference.\n\nThe point against derby rivals Hamburg lifted St Pauli to 16th spot \u2014 the relegation play-off position \u2014 but Blessin knows they face an uphill struggle.\n\n\"We did too little. We were very inactive, we were too slow. That's why we have to be happy with the point today,\" Blessin said after their lacklustre performance.\n\nOn the fight against relegation, he added: \"It will be difficult. We need to start collecting points.\"\n\nIn August, Hamburg and St Pauli staged the first Hamburg derby in the Bundesliga in 14 years after both teams had stints in the second division. St Pauli won 2-0.\n\nIrvine, who had to undergo foot surgery shortly before the end of last season and was out for a long time, has become a valued and respected member of the team since joining in 2021.\n\nBut he had made only eight appearances before Friday's clash given his injury hassles.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"He's the captain, he's the extended arm of the coaching team, and he's just extremely important,\" Blessin said.\n\nHis speedy return is bound to please the St Pauli faithful and also bring a sigh of relief to Popovic, just five months out from the World Cup to be jointly staged by the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nAustralia will play a European qualifier on June 14 (2pm) in Vancouver before meeting the United States on June 20 (5am) in Seattle. The Socceroos then take on Paraguay on June 26 (12pm) in Santa Clara in their final Group D match.\n\nBefore that Popovic's men will play friendlies against Cameroon at the Sydney Football Stadium in Sydney (March 27) and Curacao at AAMI Park in Melbourne (March 31).\n\nIrvine is a vital cog in the Socceroos midfield and with 80 caps and 14 goals will add plenty of experience to the national team.\n\nAAP",

And then Spizzirri swept through his service game to love to take the set 6-4 in 43 minutes. Sinner is not coping with the heat - or Spizzirri's energy. Could we be on for a huge upset? This article contains content that is not available. Heat rising on RLA as Sinner broken again A By Andrew McGarry There is a fascinating encounter on Rod Laver Arena, with American Eliot Spizzirri taking things to two-time champion Jannik Sinner. Spizzirri was broken early, but brought things back to 2-2. However Sinner regained the advantage with a forehand winner to take the sixth game and break for 4-2. But his opponent is going toe-to-toe right now, breaking back again and then holding for 4-4 - Spizzirri has taken the last eight points. Sinner has appeared to be taking his time between points on serve to maximise his time in the shade and recovery from the heat. Like everyone else out here today, he doesn't want to be out here for too long, so it's vital for him to break and take the first set. Take shade wherever possible L By Luke Pentony (AP) Musetti levels things up against Machac A By Andrew McGarry Over on John Cain Arena, we might be in for a long, hot afternoon, as Lorenzo Musetti and Tomas Machac are locked together at a set apiece after two hours of play. Machac took the first set 7-5, but the second set was a roller-coaster affair with five breaks of serve, before Musetti held to take the set 6-4. Musetti will be keen to rip through the next couple of sets as the heat increases, but Machac is not going away. Games are on serve in the third, with Machac leading 1-0. Amanda Anisimova takes the first set against Peyton Stearns A By Andrew McGarry Amanda Anisimova has made a fast start against fellow American Peyton Stearns (Getty Images) On Margaret Court Arena, things are moving rapidly, with fourth seed Amanda Anisimova taking the first set in an all-American matchup with Peyton Stearns. The stats don't suggest a one-sided encounter, with Anisimova hitting just three winners and having 14 unforced errors, but her experience and court sense has helped her sweep through the opening set 6-1 in 32 minutes. Early exchange of breaks between Sinner and Spizzirri A By Andrew McGarry On Rod Laver Arena, second seed Jannik Sinner has got off to a mixed start against American Eliot Spizzirri. Spizzirri, the world number 85, started off well by winning the opening point on Sinner's serve, but the Italian held serve and then broke his opponent for 2-0. However Spizzirri did not look too concerned, and he has hit straight back, forcing Sinner into a string of errors and breaking the two-time champion to love. Early days, but things might not be as straightforward as expected for the Italian. Hot day at the office L By Luke Pentony Players have been doing everything they can to keep cool on court. (AP) (AP) (AP) (AP) Machac takes first set off fifth seed Musetti A By Andrew McGarry Tomas Machac is not here to make up the numbers against Lorenzo Musetti (Getty Images) On John Cain Arena, we have the first hint of an upset today, with Czechia's Tomas Machac taking the first set against Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti. In a tight contest, momentum swung both ways in the opening set, before Machac took the set with a clean backhand winner to take it 7-5 in one hour 19 minutes. The second set has been swings and roundabouts as well, with a number of breaks of serve - but Machac will be eyeing another scalp here after his win over Stefanos Tsitsipas. Games are on serve at 4-4 in the second. Jannik Sinner next up on RLA A By Andrew McGarry Next up on Rod Laver Arena will be Italian second seed Jannik Sinner against American Eliot Spizzirri. Sinner, who is seeking a hat-trick of Australian Open titles, took care of veteran Australian player James Duckworth in straight sets in round two. He looked in fine touch the other night, and Spizzirri, who had a five-setter in round two, will be up against it. Defending champion Keys through to fourth round A By Andrew McGarry Defending champion Madison Keys has gone through to the fourth round, beating Czechia's Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 on Rod Laver Arena. Keys won 6-3, 6-3 in one hour and 15 minutes, and apart from a brief period in the first set, she looked untroubled against the former world number one. She will next face fellow American Jessica Pegula. Update on the heat scale L By Luke Pentony As of midday at Melbourne Park, the AO's heat stress scale has reached a reading of 2.2. If the scale hits 5, play will be suspended in women's and men's singles and doubles matches. The AO will apply what it describes as cooling strategies at a reading of 3 and use an extended break during matches at 4. Jessica Pegula breezes through to round four A By Andrew McGarry The first result of day seven is in the books, with American sixth seed Jessica Pegula defeating Oksana Selekhmeteva, 6-3, 6-2 on Margaret Court Arena. The American didn't serve particularly well, getting only 57 per cent of first serves in, but the ones she did land she won nearly 90 per cent of the time. The key stat was the unforced errors, where Pegula made half the number of unforced errors as her opponent. She finished the match in 66 minutes, with the added bonus of getting out of the growing heat. Pegula will next face the winner of Madison Keys versus Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1. It's heating up at Melbourne Park! L By Luke Pentony (Getty) (Getty) (Getty) (Getty) (Getty) (Getty) (Getty) Keys takes the opening set against Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 A By Andrew McGarry She had a bit of a wobble mid-set, but Madison Keys has clinched the first set against Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 on Rod Laver Arena. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 had looked like she was in the mix when she pulled herself back to 4-3 down, but Keys held serve and then produced a brilliant return effort in the ninth game. She ripped three backhand winners to leave Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 without an answer, breaking serve to take the first set 6-3 in 43 minutes. Machac's top form continues against Musetti A By Andrew McGarry On John Cain Arena, Tomas Machac is taking it to Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti. Machac made headlines when he knocked out Stefanos Tsitsipas in the previous round, and he started the day well, breaking Musetti to go to 2-0 in the first. The Italian answered back, and games are on serve at 4-3 to Machac, but the Czechian is producing some great athletic tennis and not looking overawed by any means, and Musetti would not want to take this match for granted. Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 finally on the board against Madison Keys A By Andrew McGarry Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 is finding things difficult on Rod Laver Arena against Madison Keys. She beat American qualifier Sloane Stephens in round one, and Indonesia's Janice Tjen in round two, but Keys' challenge is a definite step up. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 has had two surgeries after breaking her ankle a year ago. She is back on tour, but has said her ankle is still \"very stiff\", and court movement is an issue. She held serve to trail 4-1, but it took eight deuces to do it. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 then went out and broke Keys, suggesting she is beginning to settle - but she still has the task ahead. Pegula takes first set against Selekhmeteva A By Andrew McGarry On Margaret Court Arena, sixth seed Jessica Pegula is well on her way against Oksana Selekhmeteva. Selekhmeteva has sent down three aces, and is getting 76 per cent of first serves in, but everything else is the issue, particularly the 16 unforced errors. Pegula has taken the first set 6-3 in 33 minutes, and she looks dominant and well on her way to the fourth round. Keys in control early A By Andrew McGarry Madison Keys is playing like a defending champion on day seven (Getty Images) Madison Keys is in rhythm here, hitting winners from everywhere against Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1. She has seven winners already, and has broken Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 for a second time, to race out to a 3-0 lead. What's happening elsewhere A By Andrew McGarry On Margaret Court Arena, sixth seed Jessica Pegula is up against Oksana Selekhmeteva. Over on John Cain Arena, Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti will be taking to the court against Czechia's Tomas Machac, who caused a big upset in the previous round beating 31st seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. And on Kia Arena, men's 15th seed Karen Khachanov is underway against Italian Luciano Darderi, seeded 22. Show more posts",

(ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nA bronze statue of a water bearer that stands on a plinth in Darwin's main mall \u2014 that marks the city's strong ties to Kalymnos \u2014 has been a signpost to my history all my life.\n\nThe statue, made in Greece, was inspired by my great grandmother, whose name I share, Eleni Roussou (nee Troumouliaris).\n\nShe was a refugee, whose husband was killed in a skirmish during the Ottomon Empire's decline in what is now T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nExpelled, she fled to Kalymnos with her five children, where she worked as a housemaid for a wealthy family.\n\nA bronze Kalimnia statue, which was inspired by journalist Eleni Roussos's great grandmother, stands at Darwin's main mall. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nTo supplement her income as a single mother, she delivered fresh spring water in clay pots to homes for a fee, becoming the first woman to sell water on the island.\n\nHer story of survival inspired local artist George Economou to create a painting of a water bearer in her honour.\n\nKalymnian sculptor Michael Kokkinos and his daughter Erini were later commissioned to turn the image into sculptures, known as the \"Kalimnia\", which to this day can be found all across the island.\n\nA refugee during the Ottomon Empire's decline, Eleni Roussos's story of survival was memorialised by statues across Kalymnos island.

(Reuters: Edgar Su)\n\nVictoria, along with much of the country's south east, will experience a prolonged severe heatwave from Saturday, which has the potential to break all-time temperature records.\n\nMelbourne is tipped to hit 40 degrees Celsius on Saturday, with a total fire ban declared for the entire state.\n\nA cool change will then move through, but it won't last long. The heat will ramp up again on Tuesday, with the temperature forecast to reach 44C in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.\n\nIt will be unavoidable for athletes and revellers at the tennis, but there are some things they can do to keep cool in the heat.\n\nHow does the heat affect players?\n\nThermal physiologist Matt Brearley said while well-trained athletes were able to better tolerate heatwaves, they still had limits.\n\n\"Our bodies are like internal combustion engines \u2014 the harder we work, the harder we play, the more heat we produce,\" Dr Brearley said.\n\n\"For some people, getting up into the high 38s, low 39s, they'll start to see symptoms such as headache, fatigue, irritability and nausea.\n\n\"If it gets much higher, they'll probably see some central nervous system impairments such as confusion, delirium \u2026 [It's] extremely dangerous at that point, because the body and the brain is impacted.\"\n\nHe said athletes were \"extremely heat acclimatised\" as a result of their training, but could still experience heat stroke, which could be deadly.\n\nIt's why heat policies exist.\n\nNovak Djokovic needed some cooling off during his first round match against Pedro Martinez. (AAP Image: James Ross)\n\nWhat is Tennis Australia doing about the heat?\n\nExtreme heat at the Australian Open is not uncommon. Every year, there are at least a few days where temperatures are above 30C during the tournament.\n\nIn 2014, a four-day heatwave \u2014 which melted bottles courtside \u2014 saw a record number of players pull out of the tournament and led to many complaints from athletes and spectators.\n\nThe Australian Open introduced a new heat policy in 2018 determined by a measure called the Heat Stress Scale.\n\nIt takes into account four climate factors which determine heat stress \u2014 the temperature, radiant heat, humidity and wind speed.\n\nThese factors are recorded by a device called an environmental management unit, or EMU by the side of courts at Melbourne park, and are put into an algorithm which creates a five-point scale.\n\nThe Australian Open's heat stress scale ranges from one to five. (Supplied: University of Sydney)\n\nThe scale, which looks similar to the fire danger rating scale, then triggers certain rules in relation to heat for players.\n\nIf the scale reaches five, matches will be called off.\n\nAll-time attendance records were shattered at the Australian Open this year. (AAP Image: Lukas Coch)\n\nTennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley said there may be a break in the tennis on Saturday in the late afternoon due to the heat.\n\n\"Our Bureau of Meteorology experts are telling us probably sometime [on Saturday] afternoon \u2026 between 3 and 6pm, we could be at that point,\" he said.\n\nHow can spectators stay cool?\n\nWater misters are littered throughout the grounds and there are plenty of shady places, particularly near hydration stations.\n\nDr Brearley said while hydration was essential on hot days, by itself it may not be enough for a lot of people.\n\n\"Most people want to cool down when they get hot,\" he said.\n\n\"But what you can do is actually cool our body before you get hot and give yourself a greater window for heat storage and [for athletes] improved performance early in the match.\"\n\nHow to do that, he said, was by pre-cooling.\n\nAthletes will often jump into an ice bath or ingest crushed ice drinks before they expose themselves to heat and spectators at the tennis can achieve the same effect by eating icy-poles or slushies.\n\n\"Melting ice in your body, changing it from a solid to a liquid, requires a phenomenal amount of heat,\" he said.\n\n\"That's our body heat that melts the ice and so basically, by transferring body heat to the ice, you're creating a heat sink internally.\"",

        "text": "Two tiny babies born on different sides of the world have avoided medical treatment costing millions of dollars, thanks to an Australian-based scientist and his tanks of zebrafish.\n\nThe babies \u2014 a boy in NSW and a girl in Germany \u2014 were born in 2023 with unusual variants of the gene that causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), detected in newborn screening.\n\nNeither newborn had a family history of the condition, affecting an estimated one in 10,000 babies worldwide.\n\nBoth babies were born with variants that were previously unknown to science, making it impossible for their doctors to know whether they would develop the condition \u2014 or not.\n\nGriffith University biomedical scientist Jean Giacomotto holds up a tank of Zebrafish in his lab at the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics. (Supplied: Griffith University)\n\nThat created a dilemma. Should medical specialists start treatment, risking unnecessary intervention, with potential side effects? Or, should they delay therapy, risking irreversible harm?\n\nThe Australian Functional Genomics Network, established to enhance the understanding of genetic variants, turned to Griffith University biomedical scientist Jean Giacomotto, and his zebrafish, for clarity.\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy is caused by mutations in the SMN1 (survivor motor neuron 1) gene, leading to a lack of a protein, which is needed for motor neuron survival.\n\nIn the past, children with the most common form of the genetic condition, SMA type 1, have died before the age of two.\n\nHowever, three treatments have emerged in the past decade, including a one-off gene therapy drug, Zolgensma, which costs about $2 million.\n\nAll must be initiated before symptoms appear to avoid irreversible motor neuron death and the long-term effects of the treatment are unknown.\n\nDr Giacomotto, of Griffith University's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, used zebrafish to show both babies' SMN1 variants would not result in the disorder.\n\nDr Giacomotto injected the babies' SMN1 variants into zebrafish embryos that were bred without the gene. (Supplied: Griffith University)\n\nHe did so in less than six weeks, replicating the results.\n\nZebrafish are a home aquarium favourite with eye-catching stripes. But they are also proving to be a useful tool for researchers studying neurological conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nDr Giacomotto said zebrafish bred without a SMN1 gene, developed a form of the neuromuscular condition, resulting in degeneration of the spine, progressive loss of motor function and premature death.\n\nThey die within about six days, rather than the usual zebrafish life span of about two years.\n\nBut when he used a precision injection technique to introduce the babies' SMN1 variants into zebrafish embryos bred without the gene, he found they survived.\n\n\"We were able to functionally test each baby's exact mutation and show it was not harmful,\" Dr Giacomotto said.\n\nA developing zebrafish viewed from the side, with muscle fibres in red and motor neurons in white, helping researchers track disease progression and study the impact of genetic variants. (Supplied: Griffith University)\n\n\"This research provides the clearest demonstration to date that zebrafish can play a decisive role in clinical variant interpretation, particularly in newborns flagged through expanding genomic screening programs.\n\n\"With genomic sequencing rising worldwide, clinicians are encountering more and more uncertain variants.\n\n\" This tiny fish offers a fast and affordable way to help resolve these cases and reduce distress for families. \"\n\nThe children at the centre of the research are more than two years old and are developing normally.\n\nDr Giacomotto's research features on the front cover of the latest edition of the scientific journal EMBO Molecular Medicine.\n\nUniversity of NSW-based paediatric neurologist Michelle Farrar, who was also part of the research, described it as a \"game-changer\".\n\nZebrafish in the lab. (Supplied: Griffith University)\n\n\"It really is the first time this model's been used in a timely way that really supports clinical decision making to get the best management for the child and certainty for the families,\" Professor Farrar said.\n\nShe said gene therapy for babies with spinal muscular atrophy was only subsidised in Australia on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for children with a definitive diagnosis.\n\n\"Our newborn screening guidelines say that if you have an uncertain result, that they need to be followed up until it's clarified and so, this research was really important,\" she said.\n\nThe luminous bodies of zebrafish larvae make it easy for researchers to observe specific particular features. (Supplied: Griffith University)\n\nThe researchers suggest zebrafish could become a \"valuable model\" for testing genetic variants of uncertain significance, not only for spinal muscular atrophy, but for human disease generally.\n\n\"We are seeing an explosion of new gene variants associated with a diversity of disorders,\" they wrote in the scientific journal. \"The determination of their functional consequences is posing a significant challenge, and this problem will continue to grow with the development and need for precision/personalised medicine. \"The zebrafish can help address this translational need.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAustralian Regenerative Medicine Institute director of research Peter Currie, who was not involved in the study, described the breakthrough as a \"huge success story for modern medicine\".\n\nProfessor Currie, who uses zebrafish to research muscular dystrophy, said zebrafish were a \"well-established\" model for the study of human disease, with the freshwater fish sharing 70 per cent of its genes with humans.\n\nZebrafish embryos are also translucent, allowing scientists to study internal biological processes, including neuromuscular development.\n\nAustralian Regenerative Medicine Institute director of research, Professor Peter Currie, who uses zebrafish to study muscular dystrophy. (Supplied)\n\nThe Monash University-based researcher described Professor Giacomotto's zebrafish work as a \"really clever way to use the model to speed up the diagnostic process\".\n\nProfessor Currie said zebrafish were also a useful model to screen experimental drugs for the treatment of human disease, including cancer.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nMore than 500 people reported being injured \u2013 including 17 seriously \u2013 in crashes while riding or being hit by a hired e-scooter during Melbourne\u2019s controversial two-and-a-half-year experiment with hire scheme operators Lime and Neuron. Data obtained by The Age reveals for the first time the number of injured riders and pedestrians recorded after the e-scooter trial was launched across inner Melbourne in early 2022. A Neuron scooter in South Melbourne on Friday. The scheme is still operating in the Port Phillip council area. Luis Enrique Ascui The City of Melbourne abruptly cancelled its contract with Lime and Neuron in August 2024, with Lord Mayor Nick Reece saying scooters were \u201ccreating havoc\u201d on CBD footpaths. Lime and Neuron withdrew from the City of Yarra in March last year after the council increased its daily fee to from $1 to $5 per scooter to cover the cost of managing the scheme, but they continue to operate in the City of Port Phillip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state government declared the hire-scooter trial a success and legalised both hire schemes and privately owned e-scooters in July 2024. But it refused at the time to release information on the number of crashes and injuries recorded. Data obtained by The Age via a freedom-of-information request shows Lime and Neuron received 558 reports of injuries involving its scooters across the three local council areas between February 2022 and August 2024. Of those injuries, 180 people required medical treatment. Sixteen were admitted to hospital for more than 24 hours, and one scooter rider suffered life-threatening injuries. There were no fatal crashes. Pedestrians and other third-parties hit by hire scooter riders accounted for 37 injuries, including 15 who needed medical treatment and four who were admitted to hospital treatment for more than 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data shows Lime and Neuron also received 4837 complaints about poorly parked scooters and recorded 407 \u201cwater vehicles\u201d \u2013 meaning scooters that were dumped in rivers, lakes or the ocean. Lime and Neuron said the injury data showed their scooters were a relatively safe form of transport, considering customers took 9.4 million trips over that period, with 99.994 per cent of journeys ending safely and 0.073 serious injuries reported per 100,000 kilometres travelled. However, Reece said ending the e-scooter contract was \u201cabsolutely the right decision\u201d. \u201cToo many people were being injured, and we acted to put safety first,\u201d he said. \u201cUnsafe riding and abandoned scooters blocking footpaths created real risks for pedestrians.\u201d The data does not capture privately owned e-scooters, which have been involved in fatal crashes in Victoria and have become the focus of public concern along with high-powered e-bikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill Peters, head of Asia Pacific for Lime, said that unlike privately owned e-scooters, its devices were speed-limited to 20km/h, insured and operated with public oversight. Related Article E-Scooters The e-scooter loophole that left crash victim struggling to get by \u201cWe are proud of the e-scooter service we provided in Melbourne, helping tens of thousands of residents and visitors travel more sustainably throughout the city,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for Neuron said Melbourne was one of its busiest cities worldwide for e-scooter trips before the City of Melbourne suspended its partnership. \u201cThe vast majority of riders were behaving responsibly,\u201d they said. But for those injured, the harm has been significant and long-lasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdelaide woman Julia Miller suffered a broken shoulder and elbow when she was hit by a Lime scooter rider near the MCG in April 2022. Almost four years later, the 63-year-old still has limited use of one arm and sometimes uses a walker because of difficult balancing and related neck pain. \u201cIt\u2019s been a major impact on my life in terms of everyday function,\u201d she said. Julia Miller, who was hit by a hire scheme scooter near the MCG, pictured in 2022. Ben Searcy Miller said she was glad to see the City of Melbourne eventually ended the scooter schemes, but said councils should have put more resources into ensuring they were used safely. \u201cThese are big, heavy machines. If you jump on a bicycle you know how to ride it, but anyone can ride a scooter without knowing how to use it,\u201d she said. Miller is pursuing compensation from Lime for her injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPedestrians hit by hire scooters early in the trial found they were unable to claim on Lime and Neuron\u2019s insurance policies if the rider was not wearing a helmet or breaking other road rules. Nick Mann, principal at compensation firm Polaris Lawyers, said his firm had received numerous inquiries from people seriously injured by e-scooters. Mann said the insurance policies had improved but still had \u201ccritical gaps which are likely to leave people without coverage if they are injured by a rental scooter\u201d. \u201cWe continue to recommend that Lime and other private rental companies should be required to pay to register e-scooters with the TAC scheme to provide better protection for injured Victorians,\u201d he said. Port Phillip Mayor Alex Makin said he was comfortable continuing to work with Lime and Neuron, with hire scooters providing a valuable service to cover gaps in the public transport network. Makin said there were 31,000 hire scooter trips and five reported minor incidents in December. \u201cE-scooter usage appears to be unequivocally responsible,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMakin said safety and amenity concerns had been addressed by Lime and Neuron implementing footpath-riding detection technology, slow-riding and no-go zones and no-parking zones. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater level of comfort with how e-scooters are used in our community,\u201d Makin said. \u201cHopefully, that serves as a benchmark for if the state government looks at a whole-of-Melbourne approach in terms of what should be implemented.\u201d Loading Victoria Walks chief executive Sarah Pilgrim said the hire scheme should only be expanded if there were effective measures to keep scooters off footpaths, along with enforceable parking rules, better on-road riding infrastructure, national safety standards and no-fault insurance for injured third-parties. \u201cWhen fast, heavy devices are introduced into [footpaths], even a small number of crashes can have very serious outcomes,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t feel safe in public space, they walk less, and that has serious consequences for physical health, mental wellbeing and social connection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe injury data is based only on reports made to Lime and Neuron by riders or third parties, and could include false reports but also may not include injuries that were unreported. Lime and Neuron included the injury data in monthly reports to each council during the trial. Related Article Road safety Pedestrian fatalities reach 17-year-high. This trend could be why The Age lodged a freedom-of-information request to the City of Melbourne seeking those monthly reports in July 2024. The council agreed to provide the documents but Lime and Neuron took action in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal to prevent their release, arguing they contained sensitive commercial information. During mediation at VCAT, the two companies agreed to release a combined incident dataset. Transport Accident Commission data shows that across the same February 2022 to August 2024 period, there were 13 road deaths in the Melbourne, Yarra and Port Phillip council areas, all of which were pedestrians hit by vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLime and Neuron said \u201cwater vehicles\u201d were remotely deactivated and thoroughly tested before returning to service.

Connection and collaboration between on-stage and off-stage was instinctive as well as physical, and at least one song that had borne a heavy emotional load on record now felt as if weight had been lifted from it, for us as much as Nick Cave. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds performing in London in an earlier show on this tour. Megan Cullen With 150 minutes and 23 songs, a loosened and then discarded tie up front and three of the four backing singers in glittering silver robes up back, and at least one droll self-mocking moment (20 minutes into the show which had begun in twilight, Cave, who clich\u00e9 would have it does not surface in sun or shorts, offered to chuckles from all of us, \u201cI\u2019m unbelievably pleased it\u2019s starting to get dark\u201d), it might feel churlish to find fault. After all, Bright Horses was a ghostly splendour, like the memory of a feast spread out before us in shadows, and easily the song of the night to that point, only to be matched by Joy, an astonishing song in so many ways, from its tale of a dead son appearing at the foot of the bed declaring we\u2019ve had enough sorrow, now is the time for joy, to the way it didn\u2019t become joy but admitted there was room for it. Then I Need You, performed solo at the piano, followed them, all pain and need and emptiness waiting to be filled with the repetition of \u201cjust breathe, just breathe, and Carnage completed this quartet, elevating with sorrow\u2019s weight and a sparseness of sound. But that last point was not a coincidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis 11-piece version of the Bad Seeds was for a good portion of the show not given the clarity of sound to do them justice. Song Of The Lake was sonically murky and bass player Colin Greenwood lost, Jubilee Street built from nothing to a barrelling locomotive careering down a mountainside but its individual elements disappeared, and even Long Dark Night, whose simplicity of arrangement gave welcome space to piano and Warren Ellis\u2019 violin to lead, showed us the vibraphone being played by Jim Sclavunos but declined to let us hear it. Nick Cave performing in London with the Bad Seeds in an earlier show on this tour. Megan Cullen Missing too was some of the power in Red Right Hand and From Her To Eternity, the latter\u2019s devilish dervish rhythm relentless but thin even as Ellis contorted himself and Cave danced in echo. Was I the only one grumbling that this might have been better indoors?(Incidentally, staging a Nick Cave show outdoors as night falls in a Sydney summer and not playing Release The Bats is a missed comic opportunity. Hands up who wants to die for missing that?) Yet, so much of that could almost be forgotten and forgiven by show\u2019s end as White Elephant closed the set with an almost incongruous violence at its core balanced by gospel redemption, as the joyful energy and crowd involvement in Weeping Song opened out the encore for Cave reclaiming the beauty of Skeleton Tree, and as Into My Arms showed again it as hymnal and tender a farewell as one could ask for. Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds also play The Domain , January 24.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCABARET\n\nBARBRA\n\nHayes Theatre, January 22, until February 14\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Now here\u2019s a puzzle. The Hayes\u2019 Theatre artistic directors, Richard Carroll and Victoria Falconer, wanted a show celebrating Barbra Streisand, and asked Brittanie Shipway to direct it as well as perform in a cast of four. The creative team Shipway assembled has resulted in a sumptuous stage design from Brendan de la Hay (defined by meticulously swagged fabrics and an avalanche of hydrangeas), superbly lit by Peter Rubie, and with well-chosen songs expertly played by Nicholas Gentile and his band. Brittanie Shipway, Laura Murphy, and Stellar Perry in Barbra at Hayes Theatre. John McRae The glaring question is: Why wasn\u2019t the singing as good as everything else?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show\u2019s subtitled The Greatest Star, which sounds hyperbolic until you try to name another to match Streisand as a titan of recordings, concerts, stage and screen \u2013 smashing glass ceilings and sales statistics along the way. In celebrating her, surely nailing the singing should be central, and while no one would expect Shipway, Laura Murphy, Tana Laga\u2019aia or Stellar Perry to match up to one of the last century\u2019s most acclaimed singers, they could have avoided certain pitfalls. Tana Laga\u2019aia and Stellar Perry. John McRae One of the wonders of a singer of Streisand\u2019s stature is an effortlessness that remains in place across her range. She\u2019s a belter who doesn\u2019t shout, and when she goes high, she doesn\u2019t screech: there is no harshness to her top notes. Furthermore, she brings the emotional story of a song to life without resort to overstatement. Shipway, Murphy and Perry, by contrast, used every opportunity they could to be big and brassy. Like too many female singers in Australian musical theatre, the imperfections in their technique were exposed when they were loud and high simultaneously. Their voices\u2019 inherent appeal was the first casualty of this, and careful calibration of the differentiation between the drama of the songs was another. Brittanie Shipway, Laura Murphy, Stellar Perry and Tana Laga\u2019aia. John McRae\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaga\u2019aia\u2019s instincts were sounder, and he sweetly understated Bewitched (Bothered and Bewildered), but the pitching of his falsetto was not always accurate. He was better on The Way We Were, which felt like the first time that the show\u2019s freneticism truly unwound, and yet we were already halfway through its 75 minutes\u2019 duration. Shipway duetted prettily with Gentile on You Don\u2019t Bring Me Flowers, but, even then, they didn\u2019t quite locate the song\u2019s emotional truth. More convincing were Perry and Laga\u2019aia being soulful on Guilty. Murphy was at her best on the Streisand-composed Evergreen (the love theme from A Star Is Born), ably accompanied by Laga\u2019aia on acoustic guitar. The concluding songs were sung by the full company, the vocal harshness partially disguised when there was such genuine excitement in the air, compounded throughout by band, in which Gentile\u2019s piano was joined by Matt Reid\u2019s keyboards, Michael Napoli\u2019s bass and Sam Evans\u2019 drums. If the singers could trust themselves to back off a little more often, they would instantly sound better, and do infinitely more justice to the Streisand legacy.\n\nBarbra also shows at Riverside Theatres from February 26-28. LACRIMA\n\nRoslyn Packer Theatre, January 22, until January 25\n\nReviewed by HARRIET CUNNINGHAM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Caroline Guiela Nguyen\u2019s LACRIMA is a dense, tense and ravishly beautiful play of ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are watching the making of a wedding dress for a royal princess, destined to be an instant museum piece. As the dress takes shape, the action unravels the multifarious threads which make up this icon of maximalism: the veil, from a famous lace-making workshop; the jewel-encrusted train, hand-stitched in Mumbai; the dress, constructed in a Paris fashion house. And the non-material threads: the weight of perfection; the rampant costs of globalisation, and the price of secrecy. Performers in the Sydney Festival show LACRIMA. Wendell Teodoro Will they complete the impossible dress in time? And will they survive the ordeal? LACRIMA speaks to an audience well-versed in modern storytelling. The opening scene, for example, is the essential attention-grabber, an adrenalin shot of anguish, sirens and paramedics. Then, on the screen which hangs centre stage, we see the caption, \u201cthree months earlier\u201d. From here, LACRIMA plays out across multiple storylines, acted out on different parts of the cavernous stage, and compiled on the big screen, in a Netflix collage of talking heads and cutaways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe meet the lacemakers as they are interviewed for a podcast, and sit in on the embroiderer\u2019s compulsory eye test. We see the atelier, the bolts of fabric, the dressmaker\u2019s dummies tricked out in haute couture fantasies and hear people converse in multiple languages. It\u2019s simultaneously a documentary and drama, a live performance and a movie, flicking between formats like a restless couch-surfer flicking between channels. From the cacophony, ideas and questions emerge like pearls. The silence of workers bent over tasks is interwoven with the silence of family secrets, domestic violence and 100-year non-disclosure agreements. The demands of royal clients and rabid creatives are matched by the obsessive quest for perfection of the artisans, who will only stop working when they stop breathing. Meanwhile, Nguyen salts the action with loaded questions \u2013 why use jewels, when crushed CDs are lighter and brighter? Why impose ethical working practices on a slave economy from which you benefit? Nguyen and her small army of technicians and cast members weave a world of ideas, metaphors and storylines into one intense work of art. The performances, often direct to camera, are utterly compelling, while the staging, which involves the split-second dance of movable partitions to create multiple spaces, is visually spectacular. Add to that the visceral heft of a soundtrack which ramps up the tension with low growls and pulses. It\u2019s all too much: too many jewels, too many hours of work, and too much going on. Even the play\u2019s length \u2013 three hours, with a three-minute break where the audience is instructed not to leave the room \u2013 is almost too much to endure, drowning us in an embodied state of overwhelm. But that is the point: this work, which is one of the international showpieces of Sydney Festival, is meant to be too much. Too much to take in, but so much to take away. MUSIC\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nTikTok Entertainment Centre (ICC), January 21\n\nReviewed by GEORGE PALATHINGAL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoveliness abounds at a David Byrne show. We know this from our extraordinary shared experience in this same room in 2018 but, you know, some stuff has happened since then. We learn on this night, to some extent, how the pandemic affected the former frontman of Talking Heads, the band that all but defined NYC art rock from the late \u201970s to the mid-\u201980s. Byrne clearly tried to process some of those feelings on last year\u2019s Who Is the Sky? album, so here he continues the exercise, with some of those songs joining the tried-and-true favourites from his brilliant career. David Byrne in full flight at the TikTok Entertainment Centre. Pete Dovgan In a nutshell, he\u2019s still seeking connection, and seeing him perform remains among the most life-affirming ways to find it. Thanks to his exquisite use of screens and lights, we spend time on the moon, looking down at Earth (for the maudlin but warm Heaven); in neon-hued streets to a seamy funk soundtrack of Houses in Motion; at the (hardly hellish, unsurprisingly stylish) abode where Byrne was stuck during lockdown (the jaunty folly of My Apartment Is My Friend); and more cleverly realised locales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Byrne with a few members of the 12-strong band. Pete Dovgan There\u2019s other visual trickery, and sometimes the gimmicks supersede the songs (and distract you from the lesser ones; hello, Independence Day) \u2013 but more often than not the aesthetics emphatically enhance them. Related Article David Byrne Talking Heads legend David Byrne on embracing life\u2019s smaller moments This includes the band, a riveting, dozen-strong collective roaming the stage along with Byrne in perfectly choreographed harmony, variously playing their assigned instruments and/or dancing with infectious joy. We join them on our feet, of course, especially for the Talking Heads classics: the meticulously, blissfully building This Must Be the Place; the ever-dizzying perfection of Once in a Lifetime; the cathartic euphoria of Burning Down the House. At the risk of being That Guy, this tour is not quite as spectacular as the flawless 2018 show \u2013 a version of which you can see in Spike Lee\u2019s 2020 concert film American Utopia \u2013 though that\u2019s an opinion largely based on my feelings on the likeable but merely fine songs of Who Is the Sky? ousting others I\u2019d rather see and hear.

Who is buying the fluffy pink scarf on the Feng Chang runway, the wrap skirts at Dior and the white square neck cotton tops worn with chunky red earrings at Prada? These beautiful pieces look ready to be championed by women and fashion-forward members of the LGBTQ community such as Troye Sivan, Billy Porter and Colman Domingo, but the broader male consumer is being left behind.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAustralian jewellers are having to get used to a new daily routine: checking the wild gains in the price of gold. \u201cI have to now,\u201d said Timothy Sung, director of Melbourne\u2019s Janai Jewellery. If bombs have dropped somewhere, or US President Donald Trump has unleashed new chaos with threats of tariffs, the past year has shown that a jump in the price of gold will invariably follow. This could add hundreds or even thousands of dollars to the cost of an item of jewellery, pressuring retailers\u2019 profit margins. More so than ever before, anxious investors and central banks have been piling into gold, the yellow metal that has been prized by civilisations for thousands of years for its lustre but which is now more often favoured as a safe haven for storing wealth during uncertain times. In an era defined by geopolitical tensions, inflation fears, erratic policymaking and an erosion of trust in the US dollar, gold\u2019s value ballooned 64 per cent last year, its biggest annual gain since 1979. Janai Jewellery director Timothy Sung. Paul Jeffers Predicting the next price shock had proven a \u201cbit of a challenge\u201d lately, said Sung, as he looped around the showroom of his store on Collins Street in Melbourne\u2019s CBD. The latest jolt arrived earlier this week with fears Trump\u2019s plan to take over Greenland could set off fresh diplomatic and trade crises, which spooked financial markets and boosted gold\u2019s appeal. On Wednesday, it hit an all-time high above $US4800 ($7000) an ounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs soon as I hear news, I have to be brave enough to buy gold,\u201d said Sung, who sources gold from Australian producers, processes it at his factory in Vietnam and fabricates it into jewellery in Melbourne. He estimated that he spent tens of thousands of dollars each month last year to lock in supplies of the metal before prices marched even higher Demand for jewellery had remained resilient, Sung said, especially for engagement rings. \u201cEveryone still needs one \u2013 no ring, no wedding,\u201d he said. Janai sells about 300 rings a month, forcing Sung to try to keep one step ahead of any major fluctuations. But as rising costs have crunched retail margins and forced jewellers to reset prices, consumer preferences have also begun shifting in favour of pieces containing less gold. Jewellers report that more people are asking for nine carat or 14 carat, instead of 18 carat gold, or a different metal altogether, like platinum, which used to sell at a discount. Male wedding bands with widths of 5 millimetres or 4.5 millimetres, rather than 6 millimetres, have also gained popularity. So steep were last year\u2019s gold price rises that some heavier pieces of jewellery ended up being hundreds of dollars more expensive between the time of quoting and delivery, said Talitha Cummins, founder and director of The Cut Jewellery, which has two stores in Sydney and is launching its first in Melbourne next month. \u201cYou have to keep a really close eye on the numbers and think ahead a little bit when you are quoting to try to anticipate where prices are going,\u201d Cummins said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalitha Cummins is founder and design director of The Cut Jewellery. \u201cThere is a perception that jewellers are making a lot of money out of these price rises, but that\u2019s not the case unless you\u2019ve got stock on hand that you\u2019ve held for a long time.\u201d Naturally, higher prices had deterred people from buying as much gold as before, she said. Last Christmas, for example, fewer customers purchased gold chains with pendants than a year earlier. \u201cSome people might opt just for a pendant to wear on their own chain now,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are becoming crafty and thinking a little differently.\u201d What the coming 12 months might hold for the gold price remains to be seen, but some money managers are already betting that private-sector investors won\u2019t be selling their gold stocks anytime soon. They cite worries such as high debt levels in the US and Japan, tensions over Greenland and Trump\u2019s escalating efforts to exert control over the US central bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing has changed. If anything, Trump has gone crazier than ever,\u201d said AMP chief economist Shane Oliver. \u201cThis chips away at faith in the US, and the worries about the Federal Reserve are only ramping up. I think it will go on for a while yet.\u201d Further price rises would not be linear, Oliver said. \u201cWe will get pullbacks, as gold gets to the point that it is technically over-bought, and traders unwind their positions, but the trend will remain up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of a bull market, and gold is in a clear bull market.\u201d Cummins was bracing for challenging times to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t see world peace or a global stabilisation happening anytime soon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not looking promising, but we will have to go with what is thrown at us.\u201d The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

        "text": "New research has found that your sex and alcohol intake could be related to your risk of developing a \"major\" condition called atrial fibrillation, which could lead to stroke or heart failure.\n\nAustralian and Swedish analyses of past studies have found that while one standard drink a day affects both men and women the same, between one and four standard drinks a day increased the risk of the condition for men only.\n\nHowever, at higher levels of consumption of six standard drinks a day, women had a significantly higher risk to their heart health when compared to men.\n\nMohammad Hossein Hadi, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne, was an author of the study.\n\n\"The sex-specific pattern we observed may reflect a mix of factors, including biological differences, such as alcohol metabolism, hormonal influences, and body composition,\" he told SBS News.\n\nAustralian health guidelines recommend no more than 10 standard drinks a week for men and women, while other experts have told SBS News there is \"no safe amount\" of alcohol consumption.\n\nThere is a daily recommended limit of no more than four standard drinks a day.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation?\n\nAlcohol consumption can lead to a range of health issues, including atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder.\n\nHadi described it as a \"major heart condition\" that presents similar symptoms in men and women.\n\n\"Some people are asymptomatic, while others have persistent symptoms that affect daily functioning,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people notice palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, or reduced exercise tolerance, while others have no symptoms and are diagnosed incidentally.\"\n\nHe said that atrial fibrillation can increase a person's morbidity and mortality, often requiring ongoing management.\n\n\"It is associated with a substantial health burden.\"\n\nWhile the relative risk of atrial fibrillation differed between men and women based on intake, risk increased across the board among people who drink more frequently.\n\nDifferences in men and women\n\nRachel Visontay, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney, explained that different groups of people break down alcohol at varying rates.\n\nMen are more efficient at metabolising alcohol for a few reasons, according to Visontay.\n\n\"One, they've got a higher amount of water, which is what disperses alcohol,\" she said.\n\n\"And they've also got higher concentrations of the enzymes in the stomach that do the first part of breaking down the alcohol, which means you've got less of it going into the liver and less of it going into the bloodstream.\"\n\nTypically, this means men are less likely to experience the short and long-term health impacts of drinking when compared to women consuming a comparable amount.\n\nVisontay explained that Australia has a set guideline \u2014 recommending no more than 10 standard drinks a week for men and women \u2014 whereas in some countries, the threshold for men is higher, reflecting a greater ability to tolerate alcohol.\n\nGeneric variations in different ethnicities can also affect a person's capacity to break down alcohol.\n\nOne group that is often less able to break down acetaldehyde \u2014 one of the first byproducts the body makes when processing alcohol \u2014 is people of East Asian background, who can be more likely to experience what is colloquially termed 'Asian flush'.\n\n\"They'll start to get quite red quite quickly, and they might get some uncomfortable side effects like heart palpitations and nausea,\" she said.\n\n\"That will not just cause problems in the short term, like making drinking unpleasant, but in the long term as well.\"\n\nLong-term harms of alcohol are \"numerous\" and include an increased risk of cancers, dementia and cognitive impairment.\n\n\"There's really strong evidence for the relationship between alcohol and increased risk for cancers, and in particular the parts of the body where alcohol is making contact,\" she said.\n\nNo safe amount of alcohol\n\nClaire Gardner, manager of food and nutrition at the Australian Heart Foundation, told SBS News that following the Australian guidelines helps lower the risk of alcohol-related harm, but it does not remove all risk.\n\n\"There is no completely safe level of alcohol consumption,\" she said.\n\n\"High-quality studies, including those looking at just one standard drink, have found that even low levels of alcohol can raise the risk of heart disease.\n\nEven small amounts of alcohol increase the risk of developing neck, throat, colorectal or liver cancer.\n\nREAD MORE From cheers to fears: This is what happens to your body when you have a hangover\n\nGardner and Visontay also explained that past studies saying alcohol like red wine can be good for heart health are now outdated, and have been disproved by newer research.\n\n\"The supposed benefits of light drinking were likely influenced by the fact that light drinkers often have healthier lifestyles overall, not because alcohol itself is protective,\" Gardner said.\n\n\"Alcohol is not a defining feature of heart\u2011healthy eating patterns, even in the Mediterranean diet, where benefits come from the overall diet, not the wine.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our

        "text": "The last remaining home hope in the Australian Open women's draw is gearing up to leave everything on the court, chasing another dream win as extreme heat grips Melbourne Park.\n\nWest Australian qualifier Maddison Inglis is ready to \"lock-in\" when she steps onto Rod Laver Arena on Saturday night to face Naomi Osaka, who's been turning heads more for her fashion statements than her tennis.\n\nAlthough soaring temperatures are creating challenges for both officials and players, the day's play will start earlier and practice sessions may be halted with the mercury forecast to climb to 40 degrees.\n\nIt will be difficult conditions for Inglis, who has already spent 13 hours and 24 minutes on court across her singles, doubles and mixed doubles matches.\n\nBut the 28-year-old, who has advanced to the third round for a second time, is savouring every moment of her journey.\n\nNaomi Osaka turns heads with her on-court fashion Source: AAP / Dita Alangkara\n\n\"I know it will be a tough match,\" said Inglis, the world No.168, who would shoot up the rankings by more than 50 places should she beat four-time grand slam champ Osaka.\n\n\"But right now I'm going to soak it all in.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nConcorde's occasional visit to Australia made headline news.\n\nThis report was from Channel Nine's John Collis in 1985, who watched Concorde set off on a record-breaking trip from Sydney to London.\n\n\u201cShe received the all clear and huge jets roaring bulleted down the runway. Concorde soared rapidly to 5,000 feet, turned left through 180 degrees and set necks craning again as she swept above the harbour in a farewell salute to Sydney. She should be on the ground at Heathrow just 17 hours after takeoff, meaning yet another record for Concorde. Because no one has bothered to claim a new record for the Sydney to London flight since 1938, it still stands at 130 hours.\u201d\n\nWhile there were ambitious plans, consistent, profitable commercial routes to Australia were never established.\n\nIt was Just nine years earlier, in January 1976, that Concorde made its maiden commercial flight.\n\nNewsreel commentators waxed lyrical about the revolutionary aircraft.\n\n\u201cConcorde's paper dart appearance promises performance and it keeps its promise. It's twice the plane in more than looks. It can fly twice as fast and twice as high as other airliners and can cut journeys in half. \u201c\n\nConcorde combined raw power with a sleek elegance that made it unlike any passenger aircraft before or since.\n\nIt was the aircraft that carried royalty, celebrities and business leaders across the Atlantic at unheard-of speed.\n\nDeveloped through a joint project between Britain and France in the 1960s by the British Aircraft Corporation and Sud Aviation, later A\u00e9rospatiale, Concorde was designed to cruise at more than twice the speed of sound and at altitudes of nearly 60,000 feet, on the edge of space, far above conventional airliners.\n\nPeter Archer is the chairman of Duxford Aviation Society in Britain.\n\n\u201cConcorde design, it was in 1962, both the French and British governments had people working on it. They couldn't afford to do it separately so it came in a combined operation and over the next seven years, British designers and French designers and engineers all worked together. And it was pretty remarkable because they didn't have a lot of computing power, not like we have today. And one lot were working in metric system and the other lot in imperial, and they were building it in two factories but they all joined together and it worked.\u201d\n\nAir France and British Airways wanted to fly Concorde to the US on the lucrative trans-Atlantic route.\n\nBut American authorities were reluctant, citing sonic booms and environmental impact, banning Concorde because it was the world's noisiest plane - though many believed the ban was really because the plane had not been built by a US manufacturer.\n\nThe Europeans argued that the ban was discriminatory and detrimental to Concorde\u2019s operations - and in August 1977, the US Supreme Court agreed and the ban was lifted.\n\n\u201cThe famous nose scents a victory that a few weeks ago seemed defeat. With the skies clear to New York for supersonic flight, it's felt the rest of the world will go Concorde.\u201d\n\nThere was no getting away from the fact that Concorde looked beautiful but was, indeed very noisy.\n\nFormer chief engineer John Britton says, however, the engines were revolutionary.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things I started working on at that time, so we're talking about 1968, we were building the prototypes, so I was actually working on the engine. The engine we called the power plant because it's the engine (controls) the air intake and then the primary and the secondary nozzle. So there's three main bits of it. And the whole of it goes to make up the power plant.\u201d\n\nConcorde only ever had one crash - but it grounded the supersonic jet forever.\n\nOn the 25th of July 2000, a piece of metal dropped from a Continental Airlines DC10 on to the runway at Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris.\n\nAir France Flight 4590 ran over the debris, causing a tyre to explode and disintegrate. Tyre fragments, launched upwards at great speed damaged parts of the landing gear and ruptured a fuel tank.\n\nThe images of Concorde with flames streaming behind it in the seconds before it crashed were hard to forget.\n\nAll nine crew and one hundred passengers on board were killed, as well as four people on the ground.\n\nJohn Britton again.\n\n\u201cThe next morning we were on the crash site in Gonesse and that was a terrible experience because all our training and experience was aimed at keeping aircraft in perfect airworthiness condition and that is my responsibility. I held the airworthiness signature to the CAA in the UK for our work share of the Concorde fleet. And so to be confronted with something that we thought we would never see that was a Concorde crash was absolutely terrible and it was a real low point in our career.\u201d\n\nThe entire fleet was grounded and later returned to service after extensive and costly safety modifications, including strengthened fuel tanks and reinforced tyres.\n\nFlights resumed after 18 months, but passenger numbers never fully recovered, and maintenance requirements increased significantly.\n\nIn 2003, both British Airways and Air France permanently retired Concorde, citing rising costs, ageing aircraft and declining demand.\n\nJohn Britton says for those who worked on it, Concorde remains unmatched.\n\n\u201cMy son says, \u2018How am I going to tell the grandchildren that their grandpa flew to New York in three hours 20 minutes and it takes us if we want to go to Disneyland in Florida it\u2019s going to take us eight hours to get there?\u2019 And the answer to that is Concorde.\u201d",

        "text": "When the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, millions of Afghan women and girls saw their futures disappear.\n\nUnder the regime, they have been denied access to secondary education and universities, excluded from most jobs and faced severe restrictions on their freedom and mobility.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, nearly 80 per cent of young women aged 18 to 29 are not currently in education, employment or training in Afghanistan. Restrictions have now become the norm, with not a single decree restricting the rights of women and girls having been repealed in the four years of Taliban rule.\n\nRoya was in her final year of university in 2021 and among the last women to graduate before the regime closed the doors of higher education to women. SBS News has changed her name for safety reasons.\n\nDuring her studies, she also held down jobs in various industries including education and media, aspiring to independence.\n\nShe graduated in 2022, but since then has been \"unemployed and unable to work\" and forced to stay at home.\n\n\"The Taliban's restrictions didn't just take away my job, I think they took away my identity and a part of my future because I was an independent girl, standing on my own feet and making my own decisions,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\"Anyone who finds themselves in these circumstances feels worthless; a sense of fear and despair arises in them. And the hardest part is knowing that a person has the ability to do something but unfortunately is not allowed to do it, which is the most painful of all.\n\nThis situation has not only destroyed my life, but I think it has also silently destroyed the future of a generation of Afghan women.\n\n'Erased from public space'\n\nAfghan women experienced harsh suppression under the first Taliban rule in the 1990s.\n\nThe post-Taliban era, starting in 2001, saw significant gains for women, including access to education and employment, as well as positions in prominent political roles.\n\nZaki Haidari, a strategy campaigner at Amnesty International Australia, says after 2001, when NATO and its allies went into Afghanistan, Afghan women had access to certain freedoms and rights, particularly in major cities.\n\n\"They could go to university. [Afghanistan] had a parliament where we had women MPs ... and ministers. We had women in all sorts of government offices and public spaces,\" he says.\n\n\"In rural Afghanistan, again, there were some restrictions because the movement of the Taliban and some parts of Afghanistan were still controlled by the Taliban.\"\n\nDespite progress over the following decade, in 2011, Afghanistan was named the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman by a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey, which cited the country's high levels of violence, poor healthcare and poverty as primary factors.\n\nAnother decade on, in August 2021, the US withdrew its troops after 20 years of war and the Taliban regained power.\n\nThe rights of women and girls were rapidly rolled back. Women are now prohibited from travelling more than 75km without a male guardian, barred from public spaces such as parks and gyms, and forced to comply with strict dress codes that limit their presence in public life.\n\nHaidari tells SBS News that under the Taliban, women in Afghanistan have been \"completely erased from public space\".\n\nWhen the Taliban took over Afghanistan, all the rights were taken away from women and they were forced to stay home.\n\n\"Afghanistan is one of the only countries in the world which deprived women from having access to their basic rights.\"\n\nMore than 1,500 days without education\n\nAccording to a 2025 UN Women report, 92 per cent of Afghans support girls continuing their education beyond year 6. Yet for many high school-aged women, four out of a potential six years of secondary education has now lapsed.\n\nMariam (not her real name) was in Year 5 when the Taliban banned girls from secondary school. She was allowed to continue her studies until she completed primary education but was not allowed to progress further. She says it's a difficult reality to accept.\n\nWomen on the Ghazni highway, Afghanistan in 2025. Source: Getty / Image digitally altered\n\n\"When the school doors closed and they said girls could not study after year 6, it had a bad impact not only on me, but on all Afghan girls,\" she says.\n\n\"It is truly a great inequality that in foreign countries girls can pursue education and build a bright future, while in Afghanistan there are many girls who have no hope for the future to work for it and achieve it.\"\n\nAfghanistan is the only country in the world where girls are banned from secondary education and most forms of work, but they can still be seen on the streets begging to financially support their families.\n\nMariam, who is now 14, says she is deeply disappointed by the ongoing injustice in Afghanistan, but still hopes the international community can help make education possible for girls.\n\n\"Seeing women begging while they do not have the right to go to school is an injustice,\" she says.\n\n\"My request to the international community is to reach an agreement with the Afghan government through negotiations so that they can open schools for girls and allow girls to continue their education.\"\n\nSBS News contacted the Taliban for comment on the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan but did not receive a response.\n\nIn an August 2025 interview with SBS Pashto, the Taliban's spokesperson, Zabiullah Mujahid, stated that work has been done on women's rights, noting women are employed in various government sectors, including health, education and security.\n\nHe added restrictions on women's education are \"temporary\", and they are trying to address the existing challenges.\n\n\"Women have now found a place for themselves that was their rightful [Sharia-based] right, from which they had been deprived for many years. Nowadays, they have access to it, they can easily obtain their rights, make their own decisions, and determine their own destiny in life,\" he told SBS Pashto.\n\n\"It was initially stated that this is a temporary decision and that the needs would be assessed. We want to find a way that respects our Sharia principles and also achieves consensus in society.\"\n\nAustralian aid to Afghanistan\n\nSince 2001, the Australian government has provided more than $1.7 billion in development and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\n\nThis support continued even after the country fell under Taliban control in 2021, with Australia contributing more than $260 million to support the Afghan people in the years since. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says this funding has a strong focus on women and girls.\n\nAs Australia has no diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, SBS News understands the funding has been instead distributed to UN agencies such as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Food Programme.\n\nA spokesperson for DFAT says the Australian government is \"committed to supporting the people of Afghanistan\" during \"one of the world's most protracted humanitarian crises\".\n\n\"We also recently established the world's first autonomous sanctions framework for Afghanistan, which enables Australia to directly impose its own sanctions and travel bans to increase pressure on the Taliban, targeting the oppression of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls.\"\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, a further $50 million is allocated for 2025/26.\n\nSBS News understands aid is also provided in line with autonomous and UN Security Council sanctions, ensuring it does not directly benefit the Taliban. It is delivered through trusted partners, including UN agencies, to reach those most in need, including minority groups such as the Hazara.\n\nAfghan women look at the skyline of Kabul, Afghanistan in September 2020. Source: AP / Image digitally altered\n\nArafat Jamal is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) country representative in Afghanistan. He explains that Australian aid is delivered through the UNHCR's \"people-to-people approach\", avoiding bureaucracies and adhering to the UN's policy prohibiting assistance to the Taliban.\n\n\"The overall picture for women is very bleak, whether it's in education or jobs. At the same time, I think this is really the strength of the United Nations and why the funding that Australia and others provide is so essential, is that with that funding, we do have leverage,\" Jamal says.\n\n\"We try to ensure that every dollar that we spend in Afghanistan goes to the people ... Wherever we can, whether it's in entrepreneurship, whether it is in community centres, whether it is in counselling, gender-based violence, we do focus on women.\n\n\"And in fact, in our statistics, we end up providing more assistance to women and children than we do to men.\"\n\nAfghanistan's secret schools\n\nAlongside the Australian government, Afghan communities in Australia are also contributing to humanitarian efforts. They are providing aid and helping to run secret education programs to support women and girls in Afghanistan.\n\nDr Nilofar Ibrahimi was a gynaecologist in Afghanistan and served as a member of parliament before the Taliban's return to power. After resettling in Australia in 2021, she has remained deeply committed to advocating for Afghan women and girls.\n\n\"Women in Afghanistan are living in the darkest period of history, and the world should not remain silent in the face of this darkness,\" Ibrahimi tells SBS News.\n\nDr Nilofar Ibrahimi founded the ZamZam Foundation to support and empower vulnerable women and girls. Credit: SBS News.\n\nIn 2019, she founded the ZamZam Foundation to support and empower vulnerable women and girls, particularly orphans and widows.\n\nFollowing the fall of Afghanistan two years later, the Canberra-based foundation also started helping newly arrived Afghan refugees in Australia.\n\nIbrahimi says the focus of the foundation's work now is running secret schools in Afghanistan, where girls take risks to attend classes and learn.\n\n\"We gathered these girls very carefully and our classes focus mainly on the English language and science,\" she says.\n\n\"Through fundraising here, we send money to them to cover teachers' salaries and some expenses for the girls who travel from distant areas to different places where they study. Of course, their locations are confidential.\"\n\nBut she says the foundation's reach is limited.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Population Fund, as of 2025 Afghanistan's population is estimated to be 43.8 million. Approximately half are women, according to World Bank statistics from 2024.\n\n\"If Afghanistan has a population of 40 million, certainly 20 million of them are women,\" Ibrahimi says.\n\n\"Among these 20 million women, who are deprived of the right to work, the right to education, and even the most basic human rights, our services are very insignificant.\"\n\nThe Afghan embassy in Australia \u2014 staffed by diplomats appointed by the previous Afghan government \u2014 continues to work with the Afghan community to organise programs supporting women.\n\nAfghan ambassador in exile Wahidullah Waissi told SBS News in November 2025: \"Afghanistan is an isolated land under the Taliban regime\", adding that the embassy is \"providing a platform for people\" to come together.\n\nHe says its greatest responsibility is to \"enable an environment for greater advocacy for the girls and women of Afghanistan who are under the biggest repressive regime\".\n\nWe call it 'gender apartheid'.\n\n\"That's the biggest responsibility on us, when we are thinking about a free Afghanistan, to do something and be the voice of the silenced girls and women in Afghanistan and make the noise in a way that we see them and we are caring about their future, and we are caring about the future of our country.\"\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Pashto.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has dissolved the lower house of parliament, paving the way for a snap election on February 8.\n\nThe move is viewed as an attempt to capitalise on her popularity to help the governing party regain ground after major losses in recent years.\n\nTakaichi's conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition had a slim majority in the lower house, and did not form a majority in the upper house. The coalition relies on winning votes from opposition members to pass its agenda.\n\nThe dissolution of the 465-member lower house paves the way for a 12-day campaign that officially starts on Tuesday.\n\nTakaichi, who became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister when she was elected by parliament in October, said the move was for the interest of Japanese people.\n\n\"I believe that the only option is for the people, as sovereign citizens, to decide whether Sanae Takaichi should be prime minister,\" she told a news conference Monday when announcing plans for the election.\n\n\"I'm staking my career as prime minister (on it).\"\n\nOpposition criticises delay of economic policies\n\nDespite only being in office for three months, Takaichi has seen a strong approval rating of about 70 per cent, with particularly high support from young people.\n\nHer government enjoys around 90 per cent support among those under 30, according to a poll published at the end of December by the conservative Sankei Shimbun newspaper and Fuji Television.\n\nAs the snap election approaches, Takaichi told voters to judge her fiscal spending moves, further military build-up and tougher immigration policies to make Japan \"strong and prosperous\".\n\nHowever, opposition leaders have criticised Takaichi for delaying the passage of a budget needed to fund key economic measures.\n\nJapan has faced a surge in living costs and a chronically weak yen that has made imports more expensive.\n\n\"It's not clear if high public support for the Takaichi cabinet will actually lead to support of the LDP,\" Hidehiro Yamamoto, a politics professor at the University of Tsukuba, told the Agence France-Presse news agency.\n\n\"What the public are concerned about is measures to address inflation.\"\n\nPublic discontent over rising prices largely contributed to the downfall of Shigeru Ishiba, whom Takaichi succeeded in October.\n\nAlthough Takaichi has made her party more appealing to young voters, many traditional LDP voters have also shifted to emerging far-right populist opposition parties, such as the anti-globalist Sanseito.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan faces escalating tensions with China, after Takaichi made remarks suggesting that Japan could become involved if China takes military action against Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\u201cThe door between a Coalition, between our two parties, from my point of view, is still open. But I'm not looking at that door. I'm looking at the Australian people, because they're counting on us to deliver for them. They're counting on us to work hard for them, and that's what I will do every single day.\u201d\n\nThat was Opposition Leader Sussan Ley insisting the Coalition remains viable, despite the Nationals officially splitting from the Liberal Party this week.\n\nWith whispers of potential challenges from Andrew Hastie and Angus Taylor, she is dismissing concerns of a leadership spill.\n\n\"I am absolutely confident in the leadership that I have delivered, the leadership I will deliver and the strength of effort that my party and I are making every single day on behalf of the people. The millions of Australians who sent us to Canberra. But what is really going on here is the business of opposition. And it matters. And the government has made mistakes and will continue to make mistakes.\u201d\n\nNow, the National Party Leader David Littleproud is countering Ms Ley's friendly rhetoric, saying the alliance has collapsed after she cancelled joint party meetings and ignored his party's concerns over the new legislation.\n\nHe put the blame solely on Ms Ley's leadership, claiming that his party acted with transparency and integrity while defending their right to vote according to their values.\n\n\u201cWhen she accepted those resignations, and effectively accepted, therefore accepting the resignations of our entire ministry, that disbanded the coalition, and we could not come back and serve until those three were reinstated, that's that's where we were. The leadership of the Liberal Party is a matter for them, not for me.\u201d\n\nDr Jill Sheppard is senior lecturer in the School of Politics and International Relations at the Australian National University.\n\nShe says following previous splits and re-unifications of the Coalition, there are two things are different about this split.\n\nOne is it's the second serious split, but the third notional split that's come since the election, which was only in May last year.\n\nSecondly, she notes that while Ms Ley\u2019s popularity has failed to rebound since the last two splits, One Nation\u2019s support is surging.\n\n\u201cIt's almost impossible for the Liberals to form government by themselves. It's happened a couple of times in history and under really unusual circumstances. On the other hand, I think it's really impossible for the Nats to run alone. They don't have the funding sources of the Liberal Party. They have a viable brand in the bush, but they don't really have a viable brand in the city.\u201d\n\nAs far as Liberal party cohesion goes, deputy leader Ted O'Brien is backing Ms Ley's leadership, but others like Senator Jacinta Price are using the opportunity to re-hash old wounds.\n\nMs Price told Sky News that there has been a terminal breakdown in her relationship with Ms Ley, following the formal collapse of the Coalition.\n\nThis rift dates back to 2025, when Ms. Price was removed from the frontbench after making controversial remarks about Indian migrants.\n\nSenator Price argues the Liberals made a tactical error by backing the government's rushed legislation - leaving the question of leadership in the hands of a fractured party room.\n\n\u201cI think I made it very clear that obviously the leader had lost trust in me, lost faith in me, and I suppose I felt the same at that time. I don't feel like things have improved to that effect....and this is a decision for the party room ultimately.\u201d\n\nSo with all this chaos in the Coalition, what does the future hold for major party politics in a Westminster democracy?\n\nDr Sheppard compares the current instability in the Coalition with the insurgent rise of the UK\u2019s Reform and Green parties, noting a growing worldwide disillusionment with major party politics.\n\n\u201cI think two things are happening at once. One is that voters, on the whole are becoming a little bit more progressive, and so we're seeing a lot of governments become more more progressive try to capture that voter base. On the other hand, there are lots of voters who feel like they're getting left behind by things like globalization, free trade, and the liberalization of, you know, domestic industries. And it's really hard for governments to find a line that can speak to both of those groups of voters. And I think that's why we're seeing rises in support of parties like reform one nation.\u201d\n\nShe says voters appreciate smaller parties that are a bit more nimble, who are able to speak to very contemporary concerns in a relatable way.\n\n\u201cMajor parties, by definition, are very big, and they're very hard to change trajectory. If they can see voters going off in another direction, they find it really difficult to chase them. So what we end up with are major parties that sometimes feel like they are out of date, like they are relics from a past era.\u201d\n\nDr Sheppard suggests this fragmentation reflects a broader shift in how voters worldwide are engaging with power.\n\nShe argues that as voters abandon traditional party memberships, they are instead pouring their energy into grassroots activism and union movements, things that are political in nature, but not necessarily party political.\n\nThey want to find the representation the major parties have failed to provide.\n\n\u201cI think that has been a warning bell that the political parties here have ignored, because we have compulsory voting. Even if we're not joining those parties, we're still turning up to vote. And for our major parties, that's been good enough, and I think we're now seeing the consequence of that.\u201d\n\nAs for the prospect of a new alliance between One Nation and the Nationals, Dr Sheppard says that while the political landscape is shifting, One Nation currently lacks the formal party infrastructure required to sustain a governing coalition.\n\n\u201cOne Nation still struggles to win seats in the House of Representatives, even with preferential voting. It's a little bit easier here than it is, to say in the UK or the US, but it's still an almighty challenge. Where they do benefit in Australia is by being able to win seats in the Senate, and that means that you have a visible presence. Now, Reform in the UK is a little bit different, because even though they have huge support among voters at the moment, they only have four seats in the House of Commons there.\u201d",

Data obtained by The Age reveals for the first time the number of injured riders and pedestrians recorded after the e-scooter trial was launched across inner Melbourne in early 2022. A Neuron scooter in South Melbourne on Friday. The scheme is still operating in the Port Phillip council area. Luis Enrique Ascui The City of Melbourne abruptly cancelled its contract with Lime and Neuron in August 2024, with Lord Mayor Nick Reece saying scooters were \u201ccreating havoc\u201d on CBD footpaths. Lime and Neuron withdrew from the City of Yarra in March last year after the council increased its daily fee to from $1 to $5 per scooter to cover the cost of managing the scheme, but they continue to operate in the City of Port Phillip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state government declared the hire-scooter trial a success and legalised both hire schemes and privately owned e-scooters in July 2024. But it refused at the time to release information on the number of crashes and injuries recorded. Data obtained by The Age via a freedom-of-information request shows Lime and Neuron received 558 reports of injuries involving its scooters across the three local council areas between February 2022 and August 2024. Of those injuries, 180 people required medical treatment. Sixteen were admitted to hospital for more than 24 hours, and one scooter rider suffered life-threatening injuries. There were no fatal crashes. Pedestrians and other third-parties hit by hire scooter riders accounted for 37 injuries, including 15 who needed medical treatment and four who were admitted to hospital treatment for more than 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data shows Lime and Neuron also received 4837 complaints about poorly parked scooters and recorded 407 \u201cwater vehicles\u201d \u2013 meaning scooters that were dumped in rivers, lakes or the ocean. Lime and Neuron said the injury data showed their scooters were a relatively safe form of transport, considering customers took 9.4 million trips over that period, with 99.994 per cent of journeys ending safely and 0.073 serious injuries reported per 100,000 kilometres travelled. However, Reece said ending the e-scooter contract was \u201cabsolutely the right decision\u201d. \u201cToo many people were being injured, and we acted to put safety first,\u201d he said. \u201cUnsafe riding and abandoned scooters blocking footpaths created real risks for pedestrians.\u201d The data does not capture privately owned e-scooters, which have been involved in fatal crashes in Victoria and have become the focus of public concern along with high-powered e-bikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill Peters, head of Asia Pacific for Lime, said that unlike privately owned e-scooters, its devices were speed-limited to 20km/h, insured and operated with public oversight. Related Article E-Scooters The e-scooter loophole that left crash victim struggling to get by \u201cWe are proud of the e-scooter service we provided in Melbourne, helping tens of thousands of residents and visitors travel more sustainably throughout the city,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for Neuron said Melbourne was one of its busiest cities worldwide for e-scooter trips before the City of Melbourne suspended its partnership. \u201cThe vast majority of riders were behaving responsibly,\u201d they said. But for those injured, the harm has been significant and long-lasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdelaide woman Julia Miller suffered a broken shoulder and elbow when she was hit by a Lime scooter rider near the MCG in April 2022. Almost four years later, the 63-year-old still has limited use of one arm and sometimes uses a walker because of difficult balancing and related neck pain. \u201cIt\u2019s been a major impact on my life in terms of everyday function,\u201d she said. Julia Miller, who was hit by a hire scheme scooter near the MCG, pictured in 2022. Ben Searcy Miller said she was glad to see the City of Melbourne eventually ended the scooter schemes, but said councils should have put more resources into ensuring they were used safely. \u201cThese are big, heavy machines. If you jump on a bicycle you know how to ride it, but anyone can ride a scooter without knowing how to use it,\u201d she said. Miller is pursuing compensation from Lime for her injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPedestrians hit by hire scooters early in the trial found they were unable to claim on Lime and Neuron\u2019s insurance policies if the rider was not wearing a helmet or breaking other road rules. Nick Mann, principal at compensation firm Polaris Lawyers, said his firm had received numerous inquiries from people seriously injured by e-scooters. Mann said the insurance policies had improved but still had \u201ccritical gaps which are likely to leave people without coverage if they are injured by a rental scooter\u201d. \u201cWe continue to recommend that Lime and other private rental companies should be required to pay to register e-scooters with the TAC scheme to provide better protection for injured Victorians,\u201d he said. Port Phillip Mayor Alex Makin said he was comfortable continuing to work with Lime and Neuron, with hire scooters providing a valuable service to cover gaps in the public transport network. Makin said there were 31,000 hire scooter trips and five reported minor incidents in December. \u201cE-scooter usage appears to be unequivocally responsible,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMakin said safety and amenity concerns had been addressed by Lime and Neuron implementing footpath-riding detection technology, slow-riding and no-go zones and no-parking zones. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater level of comfort with how e-scooters are used in our community,\u201d Makin said. \u201cHopefully, that serves as a benchmark for if the state government looks at a whole-of-Melbourne approach in terms of what should be implemented.\u201d Loading Victoria Walks chief executive Sarah Pilgrim said the hire scheme should only be expanded if there were effective measures to keep scooters off footpaths, along with enforceable parking rules, better on-road riding infrastructure, national safety standards and no-fault insurance for injured third-parties. \u201cWhen fast, heavy devices are introduced into [footpaths], even a small number of crashes can have very serious outcomes,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t feel safe in public space, they walk less, and that has serious consequences for physical health, mental wellbeing and social connection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe injury data is based only on reports made to Lime and Neuron by riders or third parties, and could include false reports but also may not include injuries that were unreported. Lime and Neuron included the injury data in monthly reports to each council during the trial. Related Article Road safety Pedestrian fatalities reach 17-year-high. This trend could be why The Age lodged a freedom-of-information request to the City of Melbourne seeking those monthly reports in July 2024. The council agreed to provide the documents but Lime and Neuron took action in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal to prevent their release, arguing they contained sensitive commercial information. During mediation at VCAT, the two companies agreed to release a combined incident dataset. Transport Accident Commission data shows that across the same February 2022 to August 2024 period, there were 13 road deaths in the Melbourne, Yarra and Port Phillip council areas, all of which were pedestrians hit by vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLime and Neuron said \u201cwater vehicles\u201d were remotely deactivated and thoroughly tested before returning to service.

Connection and collaboration between on-stage and off-stage was instinctive as well as physical, and at least one song that had borne a heavy emotional load on record now felt as if weight had been lifted from it, for us as much as Nick Cave. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds performing in London in an earlier show on this tour. Megan Cullen With 150 minutes and 23 songs, a loosened and then discarded tie up front and three of the four backing singers in glittering silver robes up back, and at least one droll self-mocking moment (20 minutes into the show which had begun in twilight, Cave, who clich\u00e9 would have it does not surface in sun or shorts, offered to chuckles from all of us, \u201cI\u2019m unbelievably pleased it\u2019s starting to get dark\u201d), it might feel churlish to find fault. After all, Bright Horses was a ghostly splendour, like the memory of a feast spread out before us in shadows, and easily the song of the night to that point, only to be matched by Joy, an astonishing song in so many ways, from its tale of a dead son appearing at the foot of the bed declaring we\u2019ve had enough sorrow, now is the time for joy, to the way it didn\u2019t become joy but admitted there was room for it. Then I Need You, performed solo at the piano, followed them, all pain and need and emptiness waiting to be filled with the repetition of \u201cjust breathe, just breathe, and Carnage completed this quartet, elevating with sorrow\u2019s weight and a sparseness of sound. But that last point was not a coincidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis 11-piece version of the Bad Seeds was for a good portion of the show not given the clarity of sound to do them justice. Song Of The Lake was sonically murky and bass player Colin Greenwood lost, Jubilee Street built from nothing to a barrelling locomotive careering down a mountainside but its individual elements disappeared, and even Long Dark Night, whose simplicity of arrangement gave welcome space to piano and Warren Ellis\u2019 violin to lead, showed us the vibraphone being played by Jim Sclavunos but declined to let us hear it. Nick Cave performing in London with the Bad Seeds in an earlier show on this tour. Megan Cullen Missing too was some of the power in Red Right Hand and From Her To Eternity, the latter\u2019s devilish dervish rhythm relentless but thin even as Ellis contorted himself and Cave danced in echo. Was I the only one grumbling that this might have been better indoors?(Incidentally, staging a Nick Cave show outdoors as night falls in a Sydney summer and not playing Release The Bats is a missed comic opportunity. Hands up who wants to die for missing that?) Yet, so much of that could almost be forgotten and forgiven by show\u2019s end as White Elephant closed the set with an almost incongruous violence at its core balanced by gospel redemption, as the joyful energy and crowd involvement in Weeping Song opened out the encore for Cave reclaiming the beauty of Skeleton Tree, and as Into My Arms showed again it as hymnal and tender a farewell as one could ask for. Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds also play The Domain , January 24.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCABARET\n\nBARBRA\n\nHayes Theatre, January 22, until February 14\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Now here\u2019s a puzzle. The Hayes\u2019 Theatre artistic directors, Richard Carroll and Victoria Falconer, wanted a show celebrating Barbra Streisand, and asked Brittanie Shipway to direct it as well as perform in a cast of four. The creative team Shipway assembled has resulted in a sumptuous stage design from Brendan de la Hay (defined by meticulously swagged fabrics and an avalanche of hydrangeas), superbly lit by Peter Rubie, and with well-chosen songs expertly played by Nicholas Gentile and his band. Brittanie Shipway, Laura Murphy, and Stellar Perry in Barbra at Hayes Theatre. John McRae The glaring question is: Why wasn\u2019t the singing as good as everything else?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show\u2019s subtitled The Greatest Star, which sounds hyperbolic until you try to name another to match Streisand as a titan of recordings, concerts, stage and screen \u2013 smashing glass ceilings and sales statistics along the way. In celebrating her, surely nailing the singing should be central, and while no one would expect Shipway, Laura Murphy, Tana Laga\u2019aia or Stellar Perry to match up to one of the last century\u2019s most acclaimed singers, they could have avoided certain pitfalls. Tana Laga\u2019aia and Stellar Perry. John McRae One of the wonders of a singer of Streisand\u2019s stature is an effortlessness that remains in place across her range. She\u2019s a belter who doesn\u2019t shout, and when she goes high, she doesn\u2019t screech: there is no harshness to her top notes. Furthermore, she brings the emotional story of a song to life without resort to overstatement. Shipway, Murphy and Perry, by contrast, used every opportunity they could to be big and brassy. Like too many female singers in Australian musical theatre, the imperfections in their technique were exposed when they were loud and high simultaneously. Their voices\u2019 inherent appeal was the first casualty of this, and careful calibration of the differentiation between the drama of the songs was another. Brittanie Shipway, Laura Murphy, Stellar Perry and Tana Laga\u2019aia. John McRae\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaga\u2019aia\u2019s instincts were sounder, and he sweetly understated Bewitched (Bothered and Bewildered), but the pitching of his falsetto was not always accurate. He was better on The Way We Were, which felt like the first time that the show\u2019s freneticism truly unwound, and yet we were already halfway through its 75 minutes\u2019 duration. Shipway duetted prettily with Gentile on You Don\u2019t Bring Me Flowers, but, even then, they didn\u2019t quite locate the song\u2019s emotional truth. More convincing were Perry and Laga\u2019aia being soulful on Guilty. Murphy was at her best on the Streisand-composed Evergreen (the love theme from A Star Is Born), ably accompanied by Laga\u2019aia on acoustic guitar. The concluding songs were sung by the full company, the vocal harshness partially disguised when there was such genuine excitement in the air, compounded throughout by band, in which Gentile\u2019s piano was joined by Matt Reid\u2019s keyboards, Michael Napoli\u2019s bass and Sam Evans\u2019 drums. If the singers could trust themselves to back off a little more often, they would instantly sound better, and do infinitely more justice to the Streisand legacy.\n\nBarbra also shows at Riverside Theatres from February 26-28. LACRIMA\n\nRoslyn Packer Theatre, January 22, until January 25\n\nReviewed by HARRIET CUNNINGHAM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Caroline Guiela Nguyen\u2019s LACRIMA is a dense, tense and ravishly beautiful play of ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are watching the making of a wedding dress for a royal princess, destined to be an instant museum piece. As the dress takes shape, the action unravels the multifarious threads which make up this icon of maximalism: the veil, from a famous lace-making workshop; the jewel-encrusted train, hand-stitched in Mumbai; the dress, constructed in a Paris fashion house. And the non-material threads: the weight of perfection; the rampant costs of globalisation, and the price of secrecy. Performers in the Sydney Festival show LACRIMA. Wendell Teodoro Will they complete the impossible dress in time? And will they survive the ordeal? LACRIMA speaks to an audience well-versed in modern storytelling. The opening scene, for example, is the essential attention-grabber, an adrenalin shot of anguish, sirens and paramedics. Then, on the screen which hangs centre stage, we see the caption, \u201cthree months earlier\u201d. From here, LACRIMA plays out across multiple storylines, acted out on different parts of the cavernous stage, and compiled on the big screen, in a Netflix collage of talking heads and cutaways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe meet the lacemakers as they are interviewed for a podcast, and sit in on the embroiderer\u2019s compulsory eye test. We see the atelier, the bolts of fabric, the dressmaker\u2019s dummies tricked out in haute couture fantasies and hear people converse in multiple languages. It\u2019s simultaneously a documentary and drama, a live performance and a movie, flicking between formats like a restless couch-surfer flicking between channels. From the cacophony, ideas and questions emerge like pearls. The silence of workers bent over tasks is interwoven with the silence of family secrets, domestic violence and 100-year non-disclosure agreements. The demands of royal clients and rabid creatives are matched by the obsessive quest for perfection of the artisans, who will only stop working when they stop breathing. Meanwhile, Nguyen salts the action with loaded questions \u2013 why use jewels, when crushed CDs are lighter and brighter? Why impose ethical working practices on a slave economy from which you benefit? Nguyen and her small army of technicians and cast members weave a world of ideas, metaphors and storylines into one intense work of art. The performances, often direct to camera, are utterly compelling, while the staging, which involves the split-second dance of movable partitions to create multiple spaces, is visually spectacular. Add to that the visceral heft of a soundtrack which ramps up the tension with low growls and pulses. It\u2019s all too much: too many jewels, too many hours of work, and too much going on. Even the play\u2019s length \u2013 three hours, with a three-minute break where the audience is instructed not to leave the room \u2013 is almost too much to endure, drowning us in an embodied state of overwhelm. But that is the point: this work, which is one of the international showpieces of Sydney Festival, is meant to be too much. Too much to take in, but so much to take away. MUSIC\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nTikTok Entertainment Centre (ICC), January 21\n\nReviewed by GEORGE PALATHINGAL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoveliness abounds at a David Byrne show. We know this from our extraordinary shared experience in this same room in 2018 but, you know, some stuff has happened since then. We learn on this night, to some extent, how the pandemic affected the former frontman of Talking Heads, the band that all but defined NYC art rock from the late \u201970s to the mid-\u201980s. Byrne clearly tried to process some of those feelings on last year\u2019s Who Is the Sky? album, so here he continues the exercise, with some of those songs joining the tried-and-true favourites from his brilliant career. David Byrne in full flight at the TikTok Entertainment Centre. Pete Dovgan In a nutshell, he\u2019s still seeking connection, and seeing him perform remains among the most life-affirming ways to find it. Thanks to his exquisite use of screens and lights, we spend time on the moon, looking down at Earth (for the maudlin but warm Heaven); in neon-hued streets to a seamy funk soundtrack of Houses in Motion; at the (hardly hellish, unsurprisingly stylish) abode where Byrne was stuck during lockdown (the jaunty folly of My Apartment Is My Friend); and more cleverly realised locales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Byrne with a few members of the 12-strong band. Pete Dovgan There\u2019s other visual trickery, and sometimes the gimmicks supersede the songs (and distract you from the lesser ones; hello, Independence Day) \u2013 but more often than not the aesthetics emphatically enhance them. Related Article David Byrne Talking Heads legend David Byrne on embracing life\u2019s smaller moments This includes the band, a riveting, dozen-strong collective roaming the stage along with Byrne in perfectly choreographed harmony, variously playing their assigned instruments and/or dancing with infectious joy. We join them on our feet, of course, especially for the Talking Heads classics: the meticulously, blissfully building This Must Be the Place; the ever-dizzying perfection of Once in a Lifetime; the cathartic euphoria of Burning Down the House. At the risk of being That Guy, this tour is not quite as spectacular as the flawless 2018 show \u2013 a version of which you can see in Spike Lee\u2019s 2020 concert film American Utopia \u2013 though that\u2019s an opinion largely based on my feelings on the likeable but merely fine songs of Who Is the Sky? ousting others I\u2019d rather see and hear.

Who is buying the fluffy pink scarf on the Feng Chang runway, the wrap skirts at Dior and the white square neck cotton tops worn with chunky red earrings at Prada? These beautiful pieces look ready to be championed by women and fashion-forward members of the LGBTQ community such as Troye Sivan, Billy Porter and Colman Domingo, but the broader male consumer is being left behind.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAustralian jewellers are having to get used to a new daily routine: checking the wild gains in the price of gold. \u201cI have to now,\u201d said Timothy Sung, director of Melbourne\u2019s Janai Jewellery. If bombs have dropped somewhere, or US President Donald Trump has unleashed new chaos with threats of tariffs, the past year has shown that a jump in the price of gold will invariably follow. This could add hundreds or even thousands of dollars to the cost of an item of jewellery, pressuring retailers\u2019 profit margins. More so than ever before, anxious investors and central banks have been piling into gold, the yellow metal that has been prized by civilisations for thousands of years for its lustre but which is now more often favoured as a safe haven for storing wealth during uncertain times. In an era defined by geopolitical tensions, inflation fears, erratic policymaking and an erosion of trust in the US dollar, gold\u2019s value ballooned 64 per cent last year, its biggest annual gain since 1979. Janai Jewellery director Timothy Sung. Paul Jeffers Predicting the next price shock had proven a \u201cbit of a challenge\u201d lately, said Sung, as he looped around the showroom of his store on Collins Street in Melbourne\u2019s CBD. The latest jolt arrived earlier this week with fears Trump\u2019s plan to take over Greenland could set off fresh diplomatic and trade crises, which spooked financial markets and boosted gold\u2019s appeal. On Wednesday, it hit an all-time high above $US4800 ($7000) an ounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs soon as I hear news, I have to be brave enough to buy gold,\u201d said Sung, who sources gold from Australian producers, processes it at his factory in Vietnam and fabricates it into jewellery in Melbourne. He estimated that he spent tens of thousands of dollars each month last year to lock in supplies of the metal before prices marched even higher Demand for jewellery had remained resilient, Sung said, especially for engagement rings. \u201cEveryone still needs one \u2013 no ring, no wedding,\u201d he said. Janai sells about 300 rings a month, forcing Sung to try to keep one step ahead of any major fluctuations. But as rising costs have crunched retail margins and forced jewellers to reset prices, consumer preferences have also begun shifting in favour of pieces containing less gold. Jewellers report that more people are asking for nine carat or 14 carat, instead of 18 carat gold, or a different metal altogether, like platinum, which used to sell at a discount. Male wedding bands with widths of 5 millimetres or 4.5 millimetres, rather than 6 millimetres, have also gained popularity. So steep were last year\u2019s gold price rises that some heavier pieces of jewellery ended up being hundreds of dollars more expensive between the time of quoting and delivery, said Talitha Cummins, founder and director of The Cut Jewellery, which has two stores in Sydney and is launching its first in Melbourne next month. \u201cYou have to keep a really close eye on the numbers and think ahead a little bit when you are quoting to try to anticipate where prices are going,\u201d Cummins said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalitha Cummins is founder and design director of The Cut Jewellery. \u201cThere is a perception that jewellers are making a lot of money out of these price rises, but that\u2019s not the case unless you\u2019ve got stock on hand that you\u2019ve held for a long time.\u201d Naturally, higher prices had deterred people from buying as much gold as before, she said. Last Christmas, for example, fewer customers purchased gold chains with pendants than a year earlier. \u201cSome people might opt just for a pendant to wear on their own chain now,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are becoming crafty and thinking a little differently.\u201d What the coming 12 months might hold for the gold price remains to be seen, but some money managers are already betting that private-sector investors won\u2019t be selling their gold stocks anytime soon. They cite worries such as high debt levels in the US and Japan, tensions over Greenland and Trump\u2019s escalating efforts to exert control over the US central bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing has changed. If anything, Trump has gone crazier than ever,\u201d said AMP chief economist Shane Oliver. \u201cThis chips away at faith in the US, and the worries about the Federal Reserve are only ramping up. I think it will go on for a while yet.\u201d Further price rises would not be linear, Oliver said. \u201cWe will get pullbacks, as gold gets to the point that it is technically over-bought, and traders unwind their positions, but the trend will remain up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of a bull market, and gold is in a clear bull market.\u201d Cummins was bracing for challenging times to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t see world peace or a global stabilisation happening anytime soon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not looking promising, but we will have to go with what is thrown at us.\u201d The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

(James Shrimpton/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nMs James' father Todd told the Canadian Press that he hoped his daughter had succumbed to the surf, considering the alternative.\n\n\"We know her body was messed with (by) dingoes. It's one or the other,\" he told the Press on Friday, citing the possibility of drowning.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"We've just got to wait, and it could be one to two months.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the family shared a GoFundMe page to raise money to bring their daughter home. It had raised almost $6000 by Saturday morning.\n\nMr James and his wife Angela, Piper's mother, have also been invited to a smoking ceremony by the Butchulla people, K'gari's traditional custodians, which he said they hoped to attend.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said officials were providing consular assistance to the family.\n\nAn autopsy found evidence consistent with drowning and injuries consistent with dingo bites. (HANDOUT/Todd James)\n\nIn an earlier social media tribute, Mr James said the family would always remember his daughter's infectious laugh and kind spirit, and her determination to go after her dreams.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMs James had been living and working at a backpackers on K'gari with a friend from Canada for about six weeks.\n\nWeeks before the tragedy, there were reports of wild dogs ripping tents and stealing food. (HANDOUT/Todd James)\n\nRangers increased patrols across the island following the tragedy, which came just weeks after a warning about aggressive dingo behaviour near where Ms James was found.\n\nRangers warned of \"heightened dingo activity\" in the area where Ms James died only weeks before the tragedy, after reports of wild dogs ripping tents, approaching campers and stealing food and property.\n\nThe warning remains in place on K'gari for the summer holiday period until January 31.\n\nQueensland Premier David Crisafulli has ruled out restrictions on visitor numbers to K'gari, the world's largest sand island.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation and environmental groups have been calling for a cap on tourists, due to mounting safety concerns and damage to the World Heritage site's fragile environment.\n\nDingoes are culturally significant to the Butchulla people, who know them by the traditional name wongari.",
